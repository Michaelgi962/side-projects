Igbo people in the Atlantic slave trade

The Igbo in the Atlantic slave trade became one of the main ethnic groups enslaved in the era lasting between the 16th and late 19th century. Located near indigenous Igbo territory, the Bight of Biafra (also known as the Bight of Bonny), became the principal area in obtaining Igbo slaves. The Bights major slave trading ports were located in Bonny and Calabar; a large number of these slaves Igbo. Slaves, kidnapped or bought from fellow Africans, were taken to Europe and the Americas by European slave traders. An estimated 14.6% of slaves were taken from the Bight of Biafra between 1650 and 1900, the third greatest percentage in the era of the transatlantic slave trade.
Ethnic groups were fairly saturated in certain parts of the Americas because of planters preferences in certain African peoples. The Igbo where dispersed to colonies such as Jamaica, Cuba, Hispaniola, Barbados, United States, Belize, Trinidad and Tobago among others. Elements of Igbo culture can still be found in these places. In the United States the Igbo were found common in the state of Maryland and Virginia.
Effects.
It is estimated that a total of 1.4 million Igbo people were transported (via European ships) across the Atlantic in the era of Atlantic slave trade. Most of these ships were British.
Dispersal.
Some recorded populations of people of African descent on Caribbean islands recorded 2,863 Igbo on Trinidad and Tobago in an 1813 census; 894 in Saint Lucia in an 1815 census; 440 on Saint Kitts and Nevis in an 1817 census; and 111 in Guayana in an 1819 census.
Barbados.
The Igbo were dispersed to Barbados in large numbers. Olaudah Equiano, a famous Igbo author, abolitionist and ex-slave, was dropped off there after being kidnapped from his hometown near the Bight of Biafra. After arriving in Barbados he was promptly shipped to Virginia. At his time, 44 percent of the 90,000 Africans disembarking on the island (between 1751 and 1775) were from the bight. These Africans were therefore mainly of Igbo origin. The links between Barbados and the Bight of Biafra had begun in the mid-seventeenth century, with half of the African captives arriving on the island originating from there.
Haiti.
Some slaves arriving in Haiti included Igbo people who were considered suicidal and therefore unwanted by plantation owners. According to Adiele Afigbo there is still the Creole saying of "Ibos pend'cor'a yo" (the Ibo hang themselves). Aspects of Haitian culture that exhibit this can be seen in the Ibo loa, a Haitian loa (or deity) created by the Igbo in the Vodun religion.
Jamaica.
Bonny and Calabar emerged as major embarkation points of enslaved West Africans destined for Jamaica's slave markets in the 18th century. Dominated by Bristol and Liverpool slave ships, these ports were used primarily for the supply of slaves to British colonies in the Americas. In Jamaica, the bulk of Igbo slaves arrived relatively later than the rest of other arrivals of Africans on the Island in the period after the 1750s. There was a general rise in the amount of enslaved people arriving to the Americas, particularly British Colonies, from the Bight of Biafra in the 18th century; the heaviest of these forced migrations occurred between 1790 and 1807. The result of such slaving patterns made Jamaica, after Virginia, the second most common destination for slaves arriving from the Bight of Biafra; as the Igbo formed the majority from the bight, they became largely represented in Jamaica in the 18th and 19th century.
United States.
In the United States the Igbo slaves were known for being rebellious. In some states such as Georgia, the Igbo had a high suicide rate. Igbo slaves were most numerous in the states of Maryland and Virginia,
In the 19th century the state of Virginia received around 37,000 slaves from Calabar of which 30,000 were Igbo according to Douglas B. Chambers. The Frontier Culture Museum of Virginia estimates around 38% of captives taken to Virginia were from the Bight of Biafra. Igbo peoples constituted the majority of enslaved Africans in Maryland. Chambers has been quoted saying "My research suggests that perhaps 60 percent of black Americans have at least one Igbo ancestor..."

Château d'Olhain

The Château d'Olhain is a 15th-century castle located in Olhain, Fresnicourt-le-Dolmen, Pas-de-Calais, Nord-Pas-de-Calais, France.
The Château d'Olhain is probably the most famous castle of the Artois region. Its beauty is doubled by its position in the middle of a lake which reflects its picturesque towers and curtain walls. It was also a major stronghold for the Artois in medieval times and testimony to the power of the Olhain family, first mentioned from the 12th century.
The existence of the castle was known early in the 13th century, but the present construction is largely the work of Jean de Nielles, who married Marie d’Olhain at the end of the 15th century.
The marriage of Alix Nielles to Jean de Berghes, Grand Veneur de France (master of hounds) to the King, meant the castle passed to this family, who kept it for more than 450 years. Once confiscated by Charles Quint, it suffered during the wars that ravaged the Artois. Besieged in 1641 by the French, it was partly demolished by the Spaniards in 1654, and finally blown-up and taken by the Dutch in 1710. Restored in 1830, it was abandoned after 1870, and sold by the last Prince of Berghes in 1900. There is also evidence that one of the castles occupants was related to Charles de Batz-Castelmore d'Artagnan, the person Alexandre Dumas based his Three Musketeers charictor d'Artagnan on.
During the last two World Wars, the castle was requisitioned first by French troops, then Canadian and British soldiers. The current owner has restored the castle to its former glory.

Jurca Tempête

The Jurca MJ-2 "Tempete" (French: "Tempest") is a single-seat sport aircraft designed in France in the mid-1950s and marketed for homebuilding.
Development.
The MJ-2 is one of many wooden homebuilt designs from Romainian born designer Marcel Jurca. Jurca, a Henschel Hs 129 pilot in WWII started homebuilding with the construction of a Jodel. The first Tempete was constructed in an Aero Club de Courbevoie building in 1954 near Paris. The Tempete is a low-wing cantilever monoplane of conventional configuration and utilising wooden construction throughout apart from the fabric covering of the flying surfaces. The undercarriage is of the fixed, tailwheel or tailskid type. The pilot's seat is enclosed by a bubble canopy; some aircraft have a second seat to carry a passenger of less than 55 kg (121 lb).
The Tempête may be powered by a wide range of engines. At least 13 possibilities have been listed, each with its own suffix letter. These engines are all either Continental or Lycoming horizontally opposed types in the power range 48.5 - 134 kW (60-180 hp). The French and UK civil registers contain examples with 7 different engines, the most popular choice being the 67 kW (90 hp) Continental C90 fitted to the Tempête MJ-2D model. 
The Jurca MJ-3H Dart was a one-off sport aircraft constructed in the United States, flying in 1977. It was built by Denis Jacobs of Dayton, Ohio, marrying the fuselage of the single-seat Jurca Tempête with the wings of the two seat Jurca Sirocco. The Jurca Shadow was a variant of the Tempete with larger, swept back tail surfaces.
Operational history.
The Tempête has been flown since 1957 by private owner and sporting pilots. There have been 37 on the French register, though 4 of these have been withdrawn as of September 2010. Two Tempêtes have UK Permits to Fly in 2010. In 2000 there were several flying in the USA.
Marcel Jurca died 19 October 2001 but plans are still available in 2009 from the designer's web site.

SiteScreen

SiteScreen is an online semantic advertising technology, developed by Crystal Semantics Limited, an UK-based developer of semantic technology for use by online media companies. The company was founded in 2001 by Ian Saunders and Professor David Crystal O.B.E, a world authority on language and the author of over 150 books on the subject of linguistics. Since October 2010, the leading Nordic ad serving provider Emediate has been in charge of sales, support and marketing of SiteScreen. Headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark, Emediate has offices in Sweden and the UK as well as resellers in Norway, Finland, Germany, Italy, Benelux and Brazil. Emediate and Crystal Semantics are both subsidiaries of ad pepper media International N.V., a publicly quoted international online advertising marketing company with 16 companies in eight European countries and the USA.
SiteScreen applies the principles of semantics to online advertising with solutions to block the placement of advertisements alongside internet content that could be seen as being controversial and therefore brand damaging.
About SiteScreen.
SiteScreen filters out objectionable placements for brands – in the network, in channels and also within individual websites. As an intelligent, language-based filtering system, SiteScreen enables advertisers to exclude advertising contexts with which they do not wish their campaign to be associated. For this advertisers can choose various content themes or “categories”, like “Adult content & Nudity” or “Accidents & Disasters”.
The system analyses individual web pages, identifies undesirable content and prevents the placement of online advertising on unsuitable web pages. Undesirable environments can be found on small websites as well as high-coverage brand websites, e.g. a report on an accident on a news website, a negative travel report or a blog article.
The Technology - How SiteScreen works.
The content themes chosen by the advertisers are the basis for the configuration of a SiteScreen campaign. This configuration is then built into custom SiteScreen campaign tags that can be trafficked in adservers as standard campaign tags. These tags enable the SiteSceen semantic technology to analyze webpages when a user visits them. This automated process takes a few milliseconds. In that time, the content has been analyzed and a result obtained. The result is then passed to the SiteScreen adserver to determine if the ad campaign should be delivered or if it should be blocked and an alternative ad served.

History.
Together with the neighbouring town of Krosno, the area of Bobrowice from the 12th century on was part of the Duchy of Silesia, located near the western border with the Imperial March of Lusatia (later Lower Lusatia).
Part of the Silesian Duchy of Głogów under the Piast duke Konrad I from 1251 on, the settlement in 1476 belonged to the inheritance of Barbara of Hohenzollern, widow of the last Głogów duke Henry XI, and therefore claimed by her father Elector Albert Achilles of Brandenburg. The acquisition was officially acknowledged by Ferdinand I of Habsburg in his capacity as Bohemian king in 1538, whereafter Bobrowice was incorporated into the "Neumark" district of Brandenburg.
As part of the Prussian Province of Brandenburg the area before 1945 was part of Germany (see "Territorial changes of Poland after World War II").

John Lennon (captain)

John Lennon (1768–1846), was a naval captain, born at Downpatrick, Northern Ireland in 1768. He is stated to have served as a midshipman in the British Royal Navy during the American Revolution. In 1796, when in command of the schooner "Favorite" of Martinique, carrying letters of marque, he was very severely wounded, and his ship was taken, after a fierce engagement of one hour and twenty minutes' duration, by a French privateer of very superior force.
In 1798 he was in command of the "General Keppel", also of Martinique, which was capsized in a white squall on passage from Philadelphia, when Lennon and some of his crew were rescued by a passing schooner, after suffering great perils and hardships. Lennon performed various daring feats in the West Indies in 1806–9; but his most remarkable exploits were in the "Hibernia", a Cowes-built barque, carrying six guns and about twenty-two men and boys all told, in which he traded for some years from the West India island of St. Thomas. In 1812 orders were issued that no vessels should leave the island without convoy, on account of the American privateers. The "Hibernia" and three other merchantmen, whose aggregate cargoes were valued at half a million sterling, had long been waiting. Unwilling to detain them further, Governor Maclean agreed to their sailing without convoy, on condition of Lennon hoisting his pennant as commodore. Although harassed by the "Rossie", Commodore Joshua Barney, an American privateer of superior force, Lennon brought his vessels safe into the English Channel on 18 October 1812.
Two years later Lennon was attacked, on 19 July 1814, by the schooner "Comet" of Baltimore, U.S., an American privateer of sixteen guns and 136 men, which he beat off after a nine hour fight, in which twelve out of his crew of twenty-two hands were killed or wounded. Two lawsuits followed with the underwriters of the "Hibernia"'s cargo, and Lennon and his owners were liable for £8,000 in damages, or more than double the loss that would have been incurred if Lennon had surrendered.
Lennon and his wife Mary had two daughters. He died in retirement at his home, in Plymouth, England, on 27 August 1846 from complications (a bronchial infection) resulting from a wound he received in 1796.

Chlebowo, Lubusz Voivodeship

Chlebowo (, ) is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Gubin, within Krosno Odrzańskie County, Lubusz Voivodeship, in western Poland, close to the German border.
Geography.
It lies on the northeastern rim of the historic Lower Lusatia region, approximately north-east of Gubin, west of Krosno Odrzańskie, and west of Zielona Góra.
History.
The name of the village is possibly derived from Slavic "chleb" ("bread"). It was first documented as "Schwchleb" and "Nemascleb" in the 1295 "liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis" chronicle by the Bishops of Wrocław. The settlement then was located at the eastern border of the German March of Lusatia, close to the Silesian Duchy of Głogów. 
The area was part of the Bohemian crown lands before it passed to the Electorate of Saxony according to the 1635 Peace of Prague. Ceded to the Kingdom of Prussia, it was incorporated into the Province of Brandenburg in 1815. Under Nazi German rule, the village's name was Germanised to "Lindenhain" in 1937; after it fell to the Republic of Poland according to the 1945 Potsdam Agreement (see "Territorial changes of Poland after World War II"), it was renamed "Niemaszchleba" and again in 1953 Chlebowo.

1973 VFL Grand Final

The 1973 VFL Grand Final was an Australian rules football game contested between and at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 29 September 1973. It was the 77th annual Grand Final of the Victorian Football League (VFL), staged to determine the premiers for the 1973 VFL season. Although Carlton were the favourites to win, it was Richmond who would take the flag by 30 points, marking that club's eighth premiership victory.
Background.
This was the second consecutive year in which the two teams met in the premiership decider, with Carlton having won the 1972 VFL Grand Final by 27 points in a memorable high-scoring affair. The Tigers, who were clear favourites to win that game, were desperate to atone for that humiliating result.
At the conclusion of the regular home-and-away season, Richmond had finished second on the ladder behind with 17 wins and 5 losses. Carlton had finished third with 15 wins and 7 losses.
In the finals series, Richmond lost to Carlton by 20 points in the Qualifying Final before defeating St Kilda by 40 points in the First Semi-Final. They then defeated Collingwood by seven points in the Preliminary Final (a game in which they came back from a 45-point deficit) to advance to the Grand Final. Carlton, after their win in the Qualifying Final, defeated Collingwood by 20 points in the Second Semi-Final to advance to the Grand Final.
Both sides had injury and illness concerns before the game. Richmond champion Francis Bourke and captain Royce Hart were not supposed to be playing on strict medical grounds, but such was their determination to play that they were selected anyway. For Carlton, Barry Armstrong and Trevor Keogh were ruled out, while Alex Jesaulenko and Neil Chandler were not fully fit. Carlton were forced to name Vin Catoggio in the Grand Final side for his first full VFL game.
For field umpire Ian Robinson, this was the first of a record nine Grand Finals which he would officiate.
Match summary.
The match was played in hot, dry and blustery conditions in front of 116,956 spectators, the fourth-largest crowd in VFL/AFL history. Richmond rover Kevin Bartlett, a renowned finals performer, was prominent early, gathering kicks at will. 
The first key incident in the match occurred at the 4-minute mark of the quarter. Carlton captain-coach John Nicholls, who had masterminded Richmond's demise in the previous year's Grand Final, was coming out to mark a long kick from Alex Jesaulenko when he was sensationally felled with a high shirtfront by Richmond defender Laurie Fowler, who was running back with the flight of the ball. Fans and players were stunned at the sight of one of football's most imposing figures laying groggy on the ground and unable to rise. Teammate David McKay reflected thus on the incident: 
To see someone who was a colossus knocked out like that really stung. He was such an enormous presence on the ground as a leader that we thought, "Shit, what's going to happen now?" [...] You could talk to any player from that day and they'd tell you we were stunned. I'm not saying that was the reason Richmond won on the day, but we were starting to think twice about what the hell was happening out there. 
The impact of that incident still resonates decades later, and has been replayed on television many times since. As Fowler recalled of that incident a few years later:
"I was keyed up at the time and all I remember is that I had my eyes on the ball. If Nick had run through me the whole thing would have been forgotten." Nicholls lay motionless for at least three minutes, whilst being attended to by trainers. He was awarded a 15-yard penalty, and scored a goal from the free kick, but suffered double vision and had no impact for the remainder of the match.
Richmond's desperation to win was apparent from the outset, and with Brian "Whale" Roberts starting to get on top of Percy Jones in the ruck contests, Richmond had managed to eke out a slender lead at quarter time, with Kevin Sheedy kicking all three of their goals.
Richmond's other ruckman Michael Green—whose form leading up to the Grand Final had fans worried—opened the scoring in the second quarter when he scored a goal from a free kick at centre half-forward. Carlton hit back with goals to David McKay and Kevin Hall before big Richmond forward Neil Balme left his mark on the game. First he king-hit Carlton full-back Geoff Southby, and then moments later got a punch on Vin Waite. Southby was concussed by the blow and would not return to the field after half time. Carlton were still in the match until the time-on period of the second quarter, when Richmond took control - through goals to Bartlett, captain Royce Hart, Balme, Roberts and Ian Stewart - to lead at the main break by 26 points.
Hart kicked his third major to open the scoring for the second half, as Richmond began to slowly increase their lead. Stewart was moved to the half-forward line after injuring a leg, and kicked two goals for the quarter. Carlton was forced to make changes and brought on their second reserve, Bryan Quirk. Shortly afterward, Phillip Pinnell, who had been doing well in defence, suddenly broke down with severe cramp, and hobbled to the forward pocket, further adding to Carlton's woes. Richmond's defense, led by Francis Bourke and Dick Clay, managed to restrict the Blues to just two goals for the quarter - one each to Neil Chandler and Robert Walls. At the last change, Richmond held a commanding 38-point lead.
Carlton refused to concede defeat. After making some positional changes, the Blues kicked the first three goals of the quarter - two to Garry Crane and one to Walls. By the 15-minute mark they had managed to cut the margin to 18 points, and if Nicholls had not missed a shot from the goal-square, the game would have been up for grabs. Richmond steadied after Tom Hafey replaced Noel Carter with Kevin Morris, and when Balme kicked truly before being substituted for Craig McKellar, the contest was effectively over.
Kevin Bartlett was Richmond's best player, gathering 27 touches (all kicks, not surprisingly) and a goal. Kevin Sheedy's three goals in the first quarter were pivotal in helping the Tigers get a solid start, and he continued to be constructive throughout the match, ending up with 16 kicks and 7 handpasses. Michael Green shrugged off concerns over his lead-up form to assist Brian Roberts in subduing Carlton ruckman "Percy" Jones, and starred all around the ground, taking 8 marks and kicking a goal. And captain Royce Hart, despite a suspect left knee, was at his imperious best, kicking three goals and taking a series of strong marks.
Crane was rated as Carlton's best, and experienced finals campaigners Robert Walls and David McKay also played well. Richmond's win completed a great day for the club; earlier in the day, the Tigers had already secured the flag in the Reserves, Under 19s and Under 17s competitions. As Francis Bourke wrote after the game:
"Imagine how we would have felt if we hadn't won the big one. We couldn't have looked other teams in the eye - it's not often a club gets the chance to set such a record. How do we feel now? Bloody terrific, that's how. I never realised how sweet revenge could be, especially when it is for such a humiliating defeat as ours 12 months ago. Twelve months is a long time to live with the memory of last year's Grand Final disaster. But now we have something much better to live with. Four flags and the reputation of the strongest and most successful club in League history, that's what."
Epilogue.
For the second time in their history, Richmond would go on to win successive premierships, defeating North Melbourne in the 1974 VFL Grand Final and cementing Tom Hafey's reputation as one of the all-time great VFL/AFL coaches. Carlton's next appearance in a premiership decider came six years later, when it won the 1979 VFL Grand Final against Collingwood.

Okmeydanı

Okmeydanı (, literally "arrow field") is a neighbourhood connected to Kağıthane and Şişli boroughs of Istanbul, Turkey. It was named after the archery area and archery lodge built by Sultan Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire. Streets nearby have targeting stones to define the distances of the arrows. The most land titles of this neighbourhood are mostly owned by Fatih Sultan Mehmet Foundation, thus the buildings in the area were subject to deconstruction now and then. Currently, it consists of many important commercial and state buildings and is an important crossroad for the local transportation system.

David W. Petegorsky

David W. Petegorsky (1915-July 15 1956) was author of an acclaimed book on Gerrard Winstanley and the Diggers.
He was born in Ottawa, the only son of Leon and Beckie Petegorsky. He had three sisters and attended Lisgar Collegiate in Ottawa followed by Yeshiva College where he was valedictorian of the 1935 class and received his rabbinical degree in 1936. 
As a young Canadian student, Petegorsky studied for a doctoral degree at London School of Economics under Harold Laski. His book "Left-Wing Democracy in the English Civil War" was published as part of the Left Book Club series by Victor Gollancz, and republished by Sandpiper in 1999. This was his only book.
In 1940 he received his Ph.D. from the London School of Economics. A year later, he was an instructor at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. In 1942, he returned to Ottawa where he held an information post with the Canadian Government, first with the National Film Board, and then with the Wartime Information Board, as director of its industrial section. During this time he wrote extensively for learned quarterlies and political journals. In addition, he published two books on political subjects.
Then in 1945 he returned to New York City and became Executive Director of the American Jewish Congress. He was involved with Robert S Marcus in the World Jewish Affairs Department of the American Jewish Congress. p.251 In 1948, he became a member of the Executive Committee of the World Jewish Congress. He held both positions until his death. His funeral was held at the Kehillath Jeshurun Synagogue in New York.
In 1952, he married Carol Coan. They had twin sons, Stephen and Dan, born in 1954.
At Yeshiva University, New York, there is a David W. Petegorsky chair of Political Science. This is a tribute to his memory by the Yeshiva College Alumni Association In 1957, the Women’s Division of the American Jewish Congress initiated the David Petegorsky Scholarship Awards which sent youth between the ages of 17 and 22 to Israel for 6 weeks on workshops
Publications.
(1942) "Strategy for democracy", by J. Donald Kingsley and David W. Petegorsky, with chapters by Pierre Cot, Max Werner, Albert Gue rard, Oscar I. Janowsky Mordecai Ezekiel ... New York, Toronto, Longmans, Green and co..
Comments on Petegorsky's work.
Ariel Hessayon on "Fabricating radical traditions":
Like his contemporary Harold Laski, Tawney taught at the LSE and it was Laski's Canadian-born Jewish doctoral student David Petegorsky who completed a study of Winstanley's social philosophy. Published by the Socialist Victor Gollancz and distributed through the Left Book Club - an anti-fascist organization established in 1936 with a membership at its peak of 57,000, Petegorsky's Left-Wing Democracy in the English Civil War (1940) included chapters on 'The development of radical political thought' and Winstanley as a 'forgotten radical'. Influenced by Tawney and Laski, Petegorsky began by outlining modifications to the 'feudal structure' of English society: emergent capitalism, the rise of the middle classes, and the effects of enclosure on masses of peasants which increased urban migration and vagrancy. According to Petegorsky, Winstanley's first two 'almost unreadable' pamphlets of 1648 were typical products of chiliastic mysticism, his religious doctrines characteristic of the 'environment of the age'. Thereafter Winstanley shed that mysticism, developing 'progressive rationalist' arguments and a concern with 'practical communism' to appear as the 'most advanced radical of the century'. Significantly, Petegorsky also drew parallels between Winstanley's analysis of the 'relationship of economic power to political organization' and social transition in the twentieth century, insisting that Winstanley's challenge had 'lost none of its pertinence for our time'.The organizers of a 'Festival of Music for the People' at the Albert Hall agreed for the Diggers' song was performed on 1 April 1939 - fabled anniversary of the group's foundation.

Traffic Light Protocol

The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) was created to encourage greater sharing of sensitive information. The originator signals how widely they want their information to be circulated beyond the immediate recipient.
The TLP provides a simple method to achieve this. It is designed to improve the flow of information between individuals, organizations or communities in a controlled and trusted way. It is important that everyone understands and obeys the rules of the protocol. Only then can trust be established and the benefits of information sharing realized. 
The TLP is based on the concept of the originator labeling information with one of four colors to indicate what further dissemination, if any, can be undertaken by the recipient. The recipient must consult the originator if wider dissemination is required.

Greensforge

Greensforge is a scattered hamlet on the boundary of Kinver and Swindon parishes, in South Staffordshire, England. It is noted for its Roman associations and its industrial heritage.
Etymology.
The hamlet takes its name from a finery forge established there in the early 17th century: Mr Green's Forge. This was typical of early industrial development all along the Smestow Brook, in which bloomeries, foundries and forges used local water supplies and charcoal.
History.
The hamlet was not the earliest settlement in the area. The name Greensforge is also used for a group of Romans forts lying on the west of the brook, partly in Ashwood. The remains of one fort, extending to 2.3 hectares, are visible as a low banked enclosure on either side of Mile Flat, just east of the canal locks and wharf. This dates from period 60-80 AD. It was identified at least as early as the 18th century and numerous finds of pottery and other objects were made before it was excavated in 1929. The other, earlier, 1.8 hectare site was detected only because of air photography, but subsequently confirmed by archaeological excavation. This is a Claudian structure, dating from the earliest days of the Roman occupation. It was built to utilise the defensive possibilities of the Smestow Brook and its tributary the Dawley Brook, which today feeds into the canal through the marina at Ashwood. There are also the remains of several Roman marching camps in the immediate area.
The eponymous forge replaced a decayed mill on the Smestow Brook. Greensforge formed part of a strip of meadows along the Smestow Brook, which were assart lands of Kinver Forest, i.e. lands cleared by medieval settlers. It was let to servants of Lord Dudley and may have been used by Dud Dudley. The forge was converted to a blade mill for sharpening scythes and other edged tools in the 1680s. This was rebuilt as a corn mill in the 19th century. This has recently (in 2008) been converted into flats.
Around 1770, the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, planned by James Brindley, was driven through Greensforge and it was opened in May 1772. A brick bridge was constructed, with wharf and locks. These remain, now overshadowing the river and mill, which lie a little to their west.

HMS Wrestler (1918)

HMS "Wrestler" (D35) was a W class destroyer launched by the Royal Navy in the latter stages of the First World War and active from 1939 to 1944 during the Second World War. She was the first Royal Navy ship to bear that name, and the only one to do so to date. 
Construction.
She was the tenth order in the 1916-1917 programme, ordered on 9 December 1916 from Swan Hunter. She was laid down at Wallsend during July 1917, launched on 25 February 1918 and commissioned on 15 May that year, too late to see active service in the war. In the month of "Wrestler"s commissioning the battleship collided with "Wrestler" and badly damaged her.
Service history.
Her first deployment was in 1921, to the Atlantic Fleet's 5th Destroyer Flotilla, which also visited the Mediterranean in 1925. The Flotilla returned to the United Kingdom during the 1930s on the commissioning of new destroyers and "Wrestler" was placed in reserve. She then served as tender to the torpedo school at from 1938 until the month before the outbreak of the Second World War, when she was put on station at Gibraltar. 
From there she joined the 13th Destroyer Flotilla to defend convoys in the early stages of the Battle of the Atlantic. During 1940 she escorted Convoy OG-22F alongside and through the Western Approaches on its way to Gibraltar in March. In July 1940 she was present at the attack on Mers-el-Kébir (where she rescued crews from the British-sunk ) then joined the destroyers , , , , , , , , and as they screened the capital ships preparing for air attacks from on Italian targets on Cagliari in July 1940 - the operation was abandoned after the force came under heavy air attacks. "Wrestler" then sank the Adua class east of Gibraltar on 18 October 1940 alongside and two flying boats. 
From July 1941 to April 1942 she was stationed at Freetown and was then transferred to the Malta Convoys as part of Force H and "Operation Harpoon", before serving as one of the naval escorts for "Operation Torch". She was adopted by Hyde in December 1941 after a successful "Warship Week" National Savings campaign. She, a flying boat and sank the U-boat east of Cartagena on 2 May 1942, then on 15 November 1942 sank alone. In July 1942 "Wrestler" also boarded the Vichy French merchantman "Mitidja" (intercepted off Cape Palos, Spain by ) and escorted her into Gibraltar. 
"Wrestler" underwent reconstruction as a Long Range Escort from January to May 1943 at HM Dockyard Sheerness before taking part in "Operation Husky" off Sicily until July that year, when she returned to Atlantic and Russian convoy duties. On 6 June 1944, whilst participating in "Operation Neptune" (the naval side of D-Day), she was mined off Juno Beach and declared a constructive total loss, being sold off on 20 July as scrap.

Nelly Drell

Nelly Drell is an Estonian artist. She was born October 19, 1979 in Tallinn.
As a child she was very interested in art and while studying in Pelgulinna Secondary School she participated in extracurricular activities at the Kullo Art Centre and Kevade Street Art School. After graduating high school she carried on studying painting in 1998-2000 at the Estonian Academy of Arts. She studied at Miami University from 2000 to 2001 where she received her bachelor’s degree and from 2001 to 2003 at the New York Academy of Art where she gained a master’s degree in painting.
Drell’s creations catch the eye by being bold and realistic and having lots of figural compositions. She isn’t afraid of experimenting with different art styles. You can find from her paintings’ hyper-realistic city views, ethnic-romantic celebration and all other possible styles, from baroque to classic. The artist is just as diverse in the variation of her subjects. Among the works there are at the same time colourful sports events, dramatic scenes from history and vivid landscapes. Usage of art form and choice of motives are varying but primary attention remains focused on (harmonically depicted) people.
Drell has exhibited her paintings since 1995 at dozens of group and personal exhibitions. In 2001 she won the Miami International Fine Arts College Young Visual Artist Award and in 2008 the SMV-prize in the Estonian Artists Union’s annual exhibition.
From 2005 she has been a member of the Estonian Artists Union.
"She looks like a blonde Miss World finalist and paints like a jaded academic. I think of Drell as a born illustrator and a born painter, an artist for whom, by her very nature, academic studies and plaster drawing are ideal – an exceptionally rare quality among artists of her age."
Harry Liivrand (art-historian)
"She is able to mould an image even with the most erratic of brush strokes, lend it depth with the gentle tempering of tonalities, and what is most important – bestow on the image a sense of well-heeled cogency. Drell does not obfuscate her visions in a tactful or delicate artistic fog: she paints them with a pitiless honesty."

TodiCastle

The TodiCastle also known as "Capecchio" is a castle located c. 15 km south of the town of Todi, on a hilltop to the east side of a town called Collelungo, which is part of the Municipality of Baschi, near Terni, in Umbria, Italy. The Castle was recently recognized as "Residenza d 'Epoca", belonging to the National Heritage. It is also part of the prestigious Italian Castle circuit Institute, an international organization under the auspices of the UNESCO.
TodiCastle is one of the finest example of Italian architecture. The area of this estate spans to 45-acres. 
The castle was originally built in 1100 AD as a watch tower but later on evolved into a castle. The construction of the TodiCastle was entrusted to three architects namely Marcello Confetti, Giorgio Leoni and Vittorio Garatti.
History.
TodiCastle was built as a watch tower around 1100, during Roman times, in order to protect the "Colonia Julia Fida Tuder" (Todi Roman name) for the southern boundary line. "Torre d'Orlando" (former name of the watch tower) was built in a strategic position, to look over the area bounded by the river Tiber, the river Arnata and a famous Roman road, the via Amerina, which linked Todi to Lazio. Its strategic function continued into the Middle Ages. When Desiderius, the last king of the Lombard realm, reigned over Italy. The territory of the Julia colony was granted to the Pope; five hundred years later, in 1275, it became the Diocese of Todi and then the Municipality of Todi.
Several additional towers were built from the 10-13th century and the original tower was incorporated into a fort named TodiCastle. There were three towers in the corners and a large bastion wall to protect the wide territory. Todi flourished in the 13th century.
The food for the animals and the soldiers were stored in very large quantities within the castle and the rain water was collected for drinking. The soldiers lived in the towers and the animals were kept in the open areas. The castle was the key point for all the Northern European pilgrims that used to travel to Rome and soon enough the area became quite wealthy due to commerce and trade. In 1348 the Black Plague struck and later in the mid-14th century the municipality of Todi collapsed.
In the later years, TodiCastle continued to stand as a desolated territory with many abandoned villages, since the plague made the population less. The castle was also abandoned by the warriors and soldiers and then used by the wanderers. During 15th century, the castle was turned into a monastery. A roof was constructed in the courtyard and the space was transformed into a church dedicated to Saints Julietta and Quiricus.
Later, in the 17th century, the monastery was also abandoned and the castle became the object of dispute among several local lords. Lastly, the Landi family of Todi gained ownership of the castle. However, even then the castle remained abandoned for three hundred years. During those years the castle was sacked by hordes of barbarians, and occasionally occupied by bandits.
In the 18th century, the castle was finally acquired by the Paprini family who were the most important landowners in the area of Moruzze and Todi. and then, in 1974, by Italian Ambassador Giuseppe Santoro and since then is owned by the "Santoro family".
Architecture.
Exterior decoration.
The exterior decorations of the TodiCastle are among the finest in Italian architecture. The Estate is surrounded by 250 acres consisting of vineyards, olive groves, fruit trees and cypresses. There are two small villages within 1 km. of the castle for simple shopping, and Todi, 15 km. Away, is a hill town Orvieto, built on sharp-sided tufo hill has a beautiful, golden late Romanesque - Gothic cathedral with works by Signorelli, Orcagna, Andrea and Nino Pisano. The famous S. Patrizio's well is 13 meters wide and has a helix staircase which allowed mules to go up and own without crossing. During the year many religious and lay festivals, operas and concerts are organized in this area including the Spoleto Festival of the Two Worlds.
Interior decoration.
Back in 13th century food for animals and soldiers was stored in very large quantities within the castle .The rain water was collected for drinking. The soldiers lived in the towers and the animals were kept in the open areas. Due to these activities the castle was totally in a form of despair. With the passage of time during 15th century when it became a montesary, a roof was constructed in the courtyard and the space was transformed into a church dedicated to Saints Julietta and Quiricus. Now the Santoro family has renovated and redesigned the castle from inside. Within the castle, ancient stones, stout wooden beams frame chambers are decorated which now have become hallmarks of aristocratic bastions. The work of the architect has been a restoration.
Construction.
The Municipality of Baschi wanted total control of the area, so more than 5000 men were dedicated to build a large fortification system which included towers and fortresses, city walls and fortified historic towns. TodiCastle was quite important during the wars between Gibellines and Guelphs in the 13th century. The fortress was totally self-sufficient and there were no windows at all. Several small openings were made in the structure for the positioning of bows and arrows, which can be seen even today.
There were a few secret passages under the walls of the castle which were found during the various renovation projects. These were the routes through which the soldiers could escape in case the castle had to be relinquished. TodiCastle was important not just from the military point of view but also because of its geographic location.
Tourism.
The small town of Umbria, also known as "Green Heart" of Italy has now become a tourist attraction. In 1980, the TodiCastle was declared a national monument and since then it has appeared in several magazines. Today the TodiCastle is one of the best preserved castles from the medieval age in the area, and speaks of the history of the Umbria region in Italy. The restoration work itself took as long as ten years. The name of the castle was changed several times over the centuries. It was known as "Capecchio", "Cassa Treia" and "Casa Arsiccia" at various times.
The Santoro Family, who are the present owners of TodiCastle, live in another part of the castle and rent their castle and the surrounding villas to tourists for spending vacations, family reunion's etc.
For the purpose of accommodation of tourists, the Santoro family has also restored an olive oil mill, a stone farmhouse and a cottage in the surroundings of TodiCastle. These buildings have been turned into villas.
The Castle.
The Todi Castle is set on Umbrian hillside. Once used for war, it is now a peaceful and comfortable place with amazing views and excellent location and services for guests. The Castle is a typical example of the 13th-century fortresses that were built in the Todi Area. The same shape of building has also been built by the crusaders in the Middle East. A reference could be Castel del Monte, with its minimalistic style.
The 12th-century fortress has been completely restored, retaining its original character and a source of attraction for tourists and families who want to stay there.
Villa Pianesante.
Villa Pianesante is a 17th-century, stone farmhouse that has been completely restored, retaining its original Umbrian features. The villa is situated on a hilltop in the countryside with views of the valley below. This villa is present on the grounds of Todi Castle Estate, and is surrounded by natural beauty of the area. Villa Pianesante is situated between the medieval cities of Todi and Orvieto.
Villa Cipresso.
Villa Cipresso was originally an olive oil mill, used for centuries by the local community. The Villa Cipresso is now fully restored and is also used by the tourists for their stay.
Villa Cipresso is part of Todi Castle Estate and is located one mile from the Castle.
Villa Campo Rinaldo.
Villa Campo Rinaldo has also been fully restored and now features welcoming rooms and offers all the modern conveniences.
The villa overlooks the Apennine Mountains on one side and villages atop the Umbrian hills on the other.
Myths.
According to many legends, there are still ghosts of medieval soldiers which haunt the castle.
According to another legend, the Landi family wanted to sell the castle in the 16th century when Lucrezia, Gerolamo Landi's wife died of plague. She was buried in the castle, in its chapel.
According to the locals, the ghost of Lucrezia still wanders through the rooms of the castle on many occasions. The Todi Castle has always been an important monument in the region ever since it was built, and now the stories and legends attached to it only add to its fascination for many tourists who visit the region.

Groom in Waiting

The office of Groom in Waiting (sometimes hyphenated as Groom-in-Waiting) was a post in the Royal Household of the United Kingdom, which in earlier times was usually held by more than one person at a time – in the late Middle Ages there might be dozens of persons with the rank. Grooms-in-Waiting to other members of the Royal Family and Extra Grooms in Waiting were also sometimes appointed. For the general history of court valets or grooms see Valet de chambre.
One of the holders of the office was designated the Parliamentary Groom in Waiting from about 1859, when it became customary to appoint a Member of Parliament who was a supporter of the government of the day. The office became vacant in 1891, when Lord Burghley was promoted to the similar political office of Vice-Chamberlain of the Household. The political office was abolished in 1892, although this did not affect the non political Grooms in Waiting.

France–Syria relations

France–Syria relations are foreign relations between France and Syria. France has an embassy in Damascus and a consulate general in Aleppo and Latakia. Syria has an embassy in Paris. Both countries are full members of the Union for the Mediterranean.
Background.
Syria was under French occupation between 1920–1946, under the French Mandate of Syria. Since independence in 1946, ties have remained strong but relations are sometimes strained because of differences over the Syrian policy in Lebanon. Relations reached a bottom in 2005 after the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri. High-level bilateral political relations between the two countries only resumed after the signing of the Doha Agreement. This change has resulted in a succession of contacts and bilateral visits initiated by Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad’s visit on the occasion of the summit of the Union for the Mediterranean on 13 July 2008, and that of the French President Nicolas Sarkozy on September 3, 2008.
Economic relations.
Syria is a modest trading partner for France: 71st customer and 57th supplier. A sharp drop in French exports was a result of the cooling of bilateral political relations in 2005. A resumption in financial cooperation is currently being envisaged.
As of August 2009 it was reported that Syrian-French relations strained over wheat trade.
Cultural relations.
University cooperation is the main area of French-Syrian cooperation. France is Syria’s leading partner in this sector. Eventually, 20% of Syria’s university instructors will have been trained in France. France is the second-leading host country for Syrian students: there are more than 3,000 students in France, mostly in Masters programs and in scientific disciplines.
In the area of science, France has a special relationship in archaeology, with many joint archaeological teams active in Syria.
Moreover, Syria boasts a solid French-speaking tradition, in particular in certain Christian milieus and/or with Syria’s elite. French has been growing significantly since 2003, when it became the second language required in public education.

It is situated in the south of Santa Cruz Department on the border with Paraguay in the Cordillera Province (Charagua Municipality) and Chiquitos Province (Pailón Municipality and San José de Chiquitos Municipality).
Etymology.
Kaa-Iya is a term from Guarani mythology which means "mountain owners", or a place where riches are found, in the sense of abundance of natural resources and the relationship between man and nature.
Characteristics of the area.
It is principally known for containing the largest tropical wooded area in the world. It also contains an incredible range of animal species, most notably the last remaining large felidae and more than 100 other distinct species of mammal.

880 species of vascular plants and 28 species of spore plants (plants without flowers) have been registered in the National Park, as well as an estimated 1500 species of higher plants. Some examples which stand out are the red quebracho ("Schinopsis lorentzii"), black soto ("Schinopsis cornuta"), black guayacán ("Izozogia nelly"), cuchi ("Myracrodruon urundeuva"), purple guayacán ("Bulnesia sarmientoi"), soto de arenales ("Schinopsis corneta"), and cupesí ("Prosopis chilensis").
Other important species are the floss silk tree ("Chorisia speciosa"), Iberá-Bira ("Caesalpinia paraguariensis"), mistol ("Ziziphus mistol"), other species such as "Bougainvillea praecox", "Acacia feddeana", "Aspidosperma pyrifolium", wax palm ("Copernicia alba") and palma saó ("Trithrinax schizophylla").

Foremost among these are the "Chacoan Peccary", known locally as "tagua" or "quilimero pig", a common species in Chaco, armadillos ("Tolypeutes matacus" and "Chlamyphorus retusus"), common in the region, the Chacoan Mara and Conover's Tuco-tuco. The jaguar, puma, ocelot and maned wolf can also be found.
The presence of guanacos has been confirmed in the sand-dunes in the south-east of the Natural Area. The white-lipped peccary, armadillo, giant armadillo, silvery marmoset, black howler monkey, pampas deer, bare-faced Curassow, crowned eagle and black-and-white Hawk-eagle can also be found here.
Local population.
The pattern of human occupation in the area is made up of the Guaranís and Chiquitanos villages as well as farmers. Human presence is only in the outlying areas although it is moving inwards in respect to the use of the area's resources. There is a greater concentration of people towards the west (Isozo), Chiquitano settlements in the north and some scattered communities in other areas. In any case, it can be confirmed that the interior of the area is free of human occupation.
The greatest concentration of people is found towards the west (Bañados de Izoso), in the area's power base, where there are more than twenty Guaraní communities, including Guarirenda, Rincón, Huirapendi, Guirayasa, Coropo, Cacharí, Aguraigua, Guirapendio, Isiporenda, and Yapiroa. The largest Chiquitana community is San Pablo, located in the north. 
There are groups of mostly Izoceños and Ayoreode origin, including uncontacted groups of Ayoreode nomads.
Administration.
The development of the national park is being carried out under shared administration, under an agreement with the Upper and Lower Izozog Authority (Capitanía del Alto y Bajo Izozog), an indigenous Izoceño-Guaraní organisation, signed on 24 November 1995.
The development committee is composed of representatives from the municipalities of Charagua, Pailón, San José de Chuiquitos, and the sub-mayoralty of Isoso, as well as the founding organisations of TURUBO, CABI, CICHIPA (Indigenous Office for Chiquitano Communities of Pailón), Santa Teresita (Ayorea Community), CIMCI, and representatives of the government, SERNAP and the Departmental Prefecture.
Relevant aspects.
The park makes up the only area set aside to protect the extensive remaining areas of the South American Chaco, including most of the ecosystems belonging to the region.
This park, despite its low prominence and the apparent monotony of its countryside, is of great interest due the enormous richness of its wildlife for the development of eco- and adventure tourism.
The presence of representatives of the indigenous Izoceño, Chiquitano and Ayorea populations increases the importance of the area; among other cultural expressions, they produced very stylised craftwork.
There are historic sites in the power base of the region, e.g. the Missions of San José de Chiquitos and Santa Cruz la Vieja.
The population mostly consists of the Izoceño, Chiquitano and Ayoreode ethnicities, including a group of Ayoreode nomads. There are other populations recently migrated from other regions of Santa Cruz (ranch owners, farm workers, rural manual workers) who mostly work in cattle ranching. Access to the area is difficult.
Potential.
Given its double categorisation as National Park and Integrated Management Natural Area, the Area presents enormous possibilities for developing wildlife management programs of regional applicability.
The region undoubtedly constitutes an important natural reservoir of genetic diversity, both animal and human (indigenous Guaraní cultures). Furthermore, due to its natural and cultural value, tourist operations could be developed in the Area.
The biological diversity of the Protected Area is due to variability in climate and soil conditions, as well as the lack of availability of water, which influence the unusual flora and fauna of the region.
Threats.
The most serious threats to the park come principally from hydrocarbon-related activities; seismic prospecting in the Bañados, drilling for petroleum in Ustarez and the Bolivia-Brazil gas pipelines, followed by the expansion of agricultural and cattle-ranching landuse; illegal commercial hunting and the diversion of the river Parapeto for agricultural purposes.
Power base.
The area's most important settlements are Camiri, Charagua, Boyuibe and Cabezas in Cordillera Province, and San José in Chiquitos Province.
Accessibility.
Access to the area is difficult. In the humid season, the Area's roads are unusable. Except for the Santa Cruz-Bajo Izoso-Camiri road which borders the Area and partially enters the communities of Bajo Izoso, there are no other stable roads. In many zones entrance is via cattle paths. From San José de Chiquitos there is a bridlepath which joins Fortín Ravelo and Suárez Arana, forming the most stable path in the extreme east of the Area.

Osiecko () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Bledzew, within Międzyrzecz County, Lubusz Voivodeship, in western Poland. It lies approximately west of Bledzew, west of Międzyrzecz, south of Gorzów Wielkopolski, and north of Zielona Góra.
History.
The settlement was first mentioned as "Magnum Oszec" in a 1312 deed, when the area around Bledzew was temporarily under the rule of the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg in the west. From about 1320 until the Partitions of Poland in the late 18th century, Osiecko belonged to the Greater Polish Poznań Voivodeship. In 1360 it was a possession of the Cistercian abbey at Zemsko. Located immediately at the border with the Brandenburgian New March region, it was one of the westernmost localities of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
It was incorporated into the Meseritz district of South Prussia in the course of the 1793 Second Partition. After the Franco-Prussian Treaty of Tilsit in 1807, it was part of the Poznań Department in the newly established Duchy of Warsaw. Upon the 1815 Vienna Congress, Osiecko belonged to "Kreis Birnbaum" in the Prussian Grand Duchy of Posen, from 1887 to "Kreis Schwerin". After World War I, "Oscht" with the Posen-West Prussia frontier region remained with the German Weimar Republic according to the Treaty of Versailles.
Osiecko returned to the Republic of Poland after World War II as stipulated by the Allied Potsdam Agreement and the German population was expelled. Today the village has a population of about 420.

Tsaparang

Tsaparang was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Guge in the Garuda Valley, through which the upper Sutlej River flows, in Ngari Prefecture (Western Tibet) near the border of Ladakh. It is 278 km south-southwest of Senggezangbo Town and 26 km west of the 11th-century monastery at Thöling, and not far west of Mount Kailash and Lake Manasarovar. The Tsaparang Dzong was located here. Nearby is the Bon monastery of Gurugem.
Tsaparang is a huge fortress perched on a pyramid-shaped rock rising about 500 to 600 feet (152 to 183 m) at the end of a long narrow spur. It contains numerous tunnels and caves that have been carved out of the rock. At its base was a village where the common people lived. Above them were two public temples - the Lhakhang Marpo (Red Chapel) and the Lhakhang Karpo (White Chapel), and quarters for the monks. Further up, ascending a twisting stone staircase in a tunnel, were the royal quarters, and at the very top, the summer palace.
TV Presenter and historian Michael Wood, in the "Shangri-La" episode of the BBC TV/PBS documentary series "In Search of Myths and Heroes", suggested that Tsaparang was the historical origin of the legend of Shangri-La, and that its two great temples were once home to the kings of Guge in modern Tibet.
History.
According to some accounts, Tsaparang was made the capital of a Kingdom of Guge by Namde Wosung, one of the sons of the Langdharma the anti-Buddhist king of Tibet 838-841 CE, after Langdharma was assassinated. The Tibetan Empire was then plunged into civil war and split into a number of independent kingdoms. Other accounts say that two of Langdharma's grandsons fled to Western Tibet about 919 CE. The eldest one, Nyima Gon, established himself at Purang and conquered a large area including Ladakh and parts of Spiti. After his death his kingdom was split up between his three sons into the kingdoms of Guge, Purang, and Maryul (= Ladakh). 
Guge controlled an ancient trading route between India and Tibet. It emerged in the region previously known as Zhangzhung and became an important regional power by the 10th century CE.
In the summer of 1624 two Portuguese Jesuit missionaries, Fr. António de Andrade and Brother Manoel Marques, came to the region looking for Christian kingdoms that had long been rumored to lay beyond the Himalayas. After a harrowing journey (they were the first known Europeans to traverse the Himalayas) they arrived in Tsaparang, where they managed to gain permission from the king of Guge to freely preach their religion throughout the kingdom, and left after less than a month. After gaining formal permission and funds to start a mission in Tibet from the Jesuit superior at Goa, Andrade, Marques, and three other Jesuits journeyed to Tsaparang the next summer and built a church at the foot of the citadel and another one at Rudok 130 miles (209 km) away. António de Andrade left Tibet in 1628, and in 1630 the king of Ladakh, Senge Namgyal, invaded and overthrew the kingdom of Guge, taking the pro-Jesuit king (Tri Tashi Drakpa) and his family captive. Under Ladakhi rule the mission quickly fell into disarray; Andrade was assassinated in Goa in 1634. In 1640 Manuel Marques led an expedition back in an attempt to reestablish the mission but he was captured and the rest of his party fled. He wrote a pitiful letter to the Jesuit headquarters at Agra in India begging to be rescued, but was never heard from again. 
In 1679–80 Tsaparang and the Guge kingdom was conquered by the Central Tibetan government in Lhasa under the leadership of the 5th Dalai Lama. In spite of massive damage then, and the destruction of most of the statues and murals in both chapels by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution, many magnificent frescoes have somehow survived.

S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar

Diwan Bahadur Sakkottai Krishnaswamy Aiyangar (April 15, 1871 – November 26, 1946) was an Indian historian, academician and Dravidologist. He chaired the Department of Indian History and Archaeology at the University of Madras from 1914 to 1929.
Krishnaswamy Aiyangar was born in a village near Kumbakonam in 1871. He did his education in Madras and worked as a lecturer in Bangalore from 1899 to 1909. In 1914, he was made Head of the Department of Indian History and Archaeology at the University of Madras and held this post from 1914 to 1929. Krishnaswamy Aiyangar died in 1946 at the age of 76.
Aiyangar was elected a member of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1908 and was conferred a "Diwan Bahadur" title in 1928. He is known for the new methods he introduced in interpreting the history of Vijayanagar. His historical methodology is considered to be Indian nationalistic.
Early life and education.
Krishnaswamy Aiyangar was born in the village of Sakkottai near Kumbakonam on April 15, 1871. At the age of eleven, he lost his father. He had his schooling in Kumbakonam and graduated in history from the University of Madras in 1897. In 1899, he obtained his M. A. from the University of Madras and taught as a lecturer at the Central College of Bangalore from 1899 to 1909.
Early career.
In 1904, he was elected fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society. He was awarded an honorary PhD by the University of Calcutta. In 1928, the title of "Diwan Bahadur" was bestowed upon him.
Head of Department of Indian History and Archaeology.
In 1914, the University of Madras appointed Krishnaswamy Aiyangar to the chair of the Department of Indian history and archaeology. Aiyangar headed the department till 1929. At about the same time, Aiyangar took over a struggling periodical called "Journal of Indian History" which was started by Shafaat Ahmed Khan in 1921. Aiyangar faced financial difficulties in the beginning but rescued the journal by persuading the University of Kerala to take over the magazine. By the time, the Kerala University had taken over the magazine Aiyangar had already established the journal as one of the premium history magazines in the world.
Krishnaswamy Aiyangar was succeeded by K. A. Nilakanta Sastri to the chair of the Department of Indian History and Archaeology in 1929.
Methodology.
Krishnaswamy Aiyangar assisted Robert Sewell in his analyses of the epigraphy and archaeology of South India. These publications inspired Aiyangar to make a detailed enquiry into the history of Vijayanagar and by the 1920s, he had published a set of masterpieces on the history of Vijayanagar. His historical methodology was, however, a marked deviation from that of Sewell's and historians who had lived before him. His books devoted more attention to the Hindu-Muslim conflicts that shaped the history of Vijayanagar. In his 1921-book "Ancient India", Aiyangar states that the Vijayanagar king Veera Ballala III "made a patriotic effort to dislodge the Muhammadans from the South... fell in the effort, and brought his dynasty to an end in carrying on this great national war of the Hindus". His views were echoed by Kannadiga historian B. A. Saletore and Telugu historian N. Venkatramanayya.
Ira. Venkatachalapathi classifies Krishnaswamy Aiyangar's methodology as Indian nationalistic. His books on South Indian history were written from all-Indian perspective wherein South India is assumed to be closely related to the rest of the country and its history and civilization depicted as if it were a part of a greater Indian tradition.

Salt ceramic

Salt ceramic, also called Victorian salt clay is a traditional salt-based modeling medium.
Composition.
It is an air-dry modeling clay, which is commonly made in the kitchen by combining one part corn starch with two parts table salt and heated and stirred till it stiffens to a dough-like consistency. It is then placed on wax paper to cool before kneading.
Coloring.
The clay is naturally white, but is often colored by mixing in food color or paint after kneading.
Techniques.
Salt ceramic dries to a coarse stone-like texture, and so is often used in folk craft and children's art. Like other air-dried modeling compounds, it is not suitable for vessels that will contain liquids. 
Popular uses of salt ceramic include making jewelry and Christmas ornaments.
In jewelry making, it can be rolled into balls and formed into beads, or pressed into various shapes. In making Christmas ornaments it is sometimes made into balls, similar to the bead-making process, or rolled out with a rolling pin and cut with cookie cutters and painted.
Finishing.
It takes about two days for the objects to dry. It is known to take paint well, once hardened. It is often coated with acrylic, once hardened, to protect it from moisture.
Related modeling media.
Cold porcelain is used in a similar way, but is made with white glue in place of the salt and water. It is a popular medium for modeling lifelike flowers.
Mastic cold porcelain uses bicarbonate of soda rather than salt. It is preferred by some people who do not like to work with salt. Also known as "kitchen craft clay", it has been around since at least the 1960s.

47 Rojulu () is a 1981 Indian Telugu language drama film directed by K. Balachander starring Chiranjeevi, Jaya Prada, Sarath Babu and Ramaprabha. It was simultaneously made in Tamil as "47 Natkal" Actress Saritha plays herself in a guest role. The film is based on a novel by Sivashankari.One of the best movies in early days of chiru career, which proved his versatality.
Plot.
Actress Saritha comes to a small town to talk to Vaishali (Jayapradha), because she is about to play her in a film based on her life. Vaishali suffers from hysteria and angrily shuts out Saritha. The story is now told in flashback, when Vaishali's brother reveals to Saritha about her marriage to Kumar (Chiranjeevi), consisting of only 47 days, hence the title of the film. Kumar takes Vaishali to a country manor in France. She does not know French or English. Kumar already has a French first wife Lucy (Anne Patricia) living there on the top floor. He deceives both wives. He tells Vaishali that Lucy is a friend, while he tells Lucy that Vaishali is his sister. Eventually, Vaishali figures out his bigamy and does not want to stay with him as his second wife. She does not know of anyone who knows her language and who can help her escape Kumar.
Kumar tortures and threatens her to make her act as his mentally deranged sister. He treats her in a very sadistic manner. A desi pickpocket (Ramaprabha) sees Kumar abusing Vaishali and tells her about an Indian doctor named Shanker (Sarath Babu) who can help her. In the mean time, Vaishali becomes pregnant, and Kumar is afraid that Lucy will discover his deception, so he tries to force Vaishali to have an unsafe abortion. Dr. Shanker rescues her and also tells Lucy everything about Kumar's bigamy. Lucy ends her marriage. Dr. Shanker brings Vaishali back to India, who moves back in with her brother and mother. No mention is made as to what happened to her pregnancy and no baby is seen or heard. It is presumed that she may have later had an abortion, since she did not want to be connected to her ex-husband Kumar. When Saritha asks why Vaishali didn't re-marry, such as to her rescuer Dr. Shanker, Vaishali angrily replies that a woman does not always have to be married. However, she placates Saritha by saying that she wouldn't mind if her character is shown off as remarried in the film.

Charles Darwin and the Tree of Life

Charles Darwin and the Tree of Life is a 2009 television documentary about Charles Darwin and his revolutionary theory of evolution through natural selection, produced by the BBC to mark the bicentenary of Darwin's birth. It is part of the BBC Darwin Season. The presenter, David Attenborough, outlines the development of the theory by Darwin through his observations of animals and plants in nature and in the domesticated state, visiting sites important in Darwin's own life, including Down House, Cambridge University and the Natural History Museum, and using archive footage from Attenborough's many nature documentaries for the BBC. He reviews the development of the theory since its beginnings, and its revolutionary impact on the way in which humans view themselves - not as having dominion over the animals as The Bible says, but as part of the natural world and subject to the same controlling forces that govern all life on Earth.
Reception.
The programme was aired in a primetime slot on BBC One, at 9pm on Sunday 1 February. Official ratings from BARB show that it attracted an audience of 6.34 million viewers, a healthy figure for a factual programme. Overnight data suggested 23% of the available audience was watching.
The programme drew effusive praise from critics:

Local self-government in India

Panchayati Raj (Rule of Village Committee) Panchayati Raj system is a three-tier system in the state with elected bodies at the Village, Taluk and District levels. It ensures greater participation of people and more effective implementation of rural development programmes. There will be a Grama Panchayat for a village or group of villages, a Taluk level and the Zilla Panchayat at the district level.
India has a chequered history of panchayati raj starting from a self-sufficient and self-governing village communities that survived the rise and fall of empires in the past to the modern institutions of governance at the third tier provided with Constitutional support.
Early history.
In the time of the Rig-Veda (1700 BC), evidences suggest that self-governing village bodies called 'sabhas' existed. With the passage of time, these bodies became panchayats (council of five persons). Panchayats were functional institutions of grassroots governance in almost every village. The Village Panchayat or elected council had large powers, both executive and judicial. Land was distributed by this panchayat which also collected taxes out of the produce and paid the government's share on behalf of the village. Above a number of these village councils there was a larger panchayat or council to supervise and interfere if necessary. 
Casteism and feudalistic system of governance under Mughal rule in the medieval period slowly eroded the self-government in villages. A new class of feudal chiefs and revenue collectors (zamindars) emerged between the ruler and the people. And, so began the stagnation and decline of self-government in villages.
During the British rule, the autonomy of panchayats gradually declined with the establishment of local civil and criminal courts, revenue and police organisations, the increase in communications, the growth of individualism and the operation of the individual Ryotwari '(landholder-wise) system as against the Mahalwari or village tenure system.
During British rule.
The panchayat had never been the priority of the British rulers. The rulers were interested in the creation of 'controlled' local bodies, which could help them in their trading interests by collecting taxes for them. When the colonial administration came under severe financial pressure after the 1857 uprising, the remedy sought was decentralisation in terms of transferring responsibility for road and public works to local bodies. However, the thrust of this 'compelled' decentralisation was with respect to municipal administration..
"The panchayat was destroyed by the East India Company when it was granted the office of Diwan in 1765 by the Mughal Emperor as part of reparation after his defeat at Buxar. As Diwan the Company took two decisions. The first was that it abolished the village land record office and created a company official called Patwari. The Patwari became the official record keeper for a number of villages. The second was the creation of the office of magistrate and the abolition of village police. The magistrate carried out policing functions through the Darogha who had always been a state functionary under the Faujdar. The primary purpose of these measures was the collection of land revenue by fiat. The depredations of the Patwari and the Darogha are part of our folklore and it led to the worst famine in Bengal. The effects of the famine lingered right to the end of the 18th century. These two measures completely disempowered the village community and destroyed the panchayat. After 1857 the British tried to restore the panchayat by giving it powers to try minor offences and to resolve village disputes. But these measures never restored the lost powers of the village community."
From 1870 that Viceroy Lord Mayo's Resolution (for decentralisation of power to bring about administrative efficiency in meeting people's demand and to add to the finances of colonial regime) gave the needed impetus to the development of local institutions. It was a landmark in the evolution of colonial policy towards local government. The real benchmarking of the government policy on decentralisation can, however, be attributed to Lord Ripon who, in his famous resolution on local self-government on May 18, 1882, recognised the twin considerations of local government: (i) administrative efficiency and (ii) political education.
The Ripon Resolution, which focused on towns, provided for local bodies consisting of a large majority of elected non-official members and presided over by a non-official chairperson. This resolution met with resistance from colonial administrators. The progress of local self-government was tardy with only half-hearted steps taken in setting up municipal bodies. Rural decentralisation remained a neglected area of administrative reform.
The Royal Commission on Decentralisation (1907) under the chairmanship of C.E.H. Hobhouse recognised the importance of panchayats at the village level. The commission recommended that "it is most desirable, alike in the interests of decentralisation and in order to associate the people with the local tasks of administration, that an attempt should be made to constitute and develop village panchayats for the administration of local village affairs".
But, the Montague-Chemsford reforms (1919) brought local self-government as a provincial transferred subject, under the domain of Indian ministers in the provinces. Due to organisational and fiscal constraints, the reform was unable to make panchayat institutions truly democratic and vibrant. However, the most significant development of this period was the 'establishment of village panchayats in a number of provinces, that were no longer mere ad hoc judicial tribunal, but representative institutions symbolising the corporate character of the village and having a wide jurisdiction in respect of civic matters'. l By 1925, eight provinces had passed panchayat acts and by 1926, six native states had also passed panchayat laws.
The provincial autonomy under the Government of India Act, 1935, marked the evolution of panchayats in India. Popularly elected governments in provinces enacted legislations to further democratise institutions of local self-government. But the system of responsible government at the grassroots level was least responsible. D.P. Mishra, the then minister for local self-government under the Government of India Act of 1935 in Central Provinces was of the view that 'the working of our local bodies... in our province and perhaps in the whole country presents a tragic picture... 'Inefficiency' and 'local body' have become synonymous terms...'.
In spite of various committees such as the Royal Commission on Decentralization (1907), the report of Montague and Chemsford on constitutional reform (1919), the Government of India Resolution (1919), etc., a hierarchical administrative structure based on supervision and control evolved. The administrator became the focal point of rural governance. The British were not concerned with decentralised democracy but were aiming for colonial objectives.
The Indian National Congress from the 1920s to 1947, emphasized the issue of all-India Swaraj, and organized movements for Independence under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi. The task of preparing any sort of blueprint for the local level was neglected as a result. There was no consensus among the top leaders regarding the status and role to be assigned to the institution of rural local self-government; rather there were divergent views on the subject. On the one end Gandhi favoured Village Swaraj and strengthening the village panchayat to the fullest extent and on the other end, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar opposed this idea. He believed that the village represented regressive India, a source of oppression. The model state hence had to build safeguards against such social oppression and the only way it could be done was through the adoption of the parliamentary model of politics 
During the drafting of the Constitution of India, Panchayati Raj Institutions were placed in the non-justiciable part of the Constitution, the Directive Principles of State Policy, as Article 40. The Article read 'the State shall take steps to organise village panchayats and endow them with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of self-government'. However, no worthwhile legislation was enacted either at the national or state level to implement it.
In the four decades since the adoption of the Constitution, panchayat raj institutions have travelled from the non-justiciable part of the Constitution to one where, through a separate amendment, a whole new status has been added to their history 
Post-independence period.
Panchayat raj had to go through various stages. The First Five Year Plan failed to bring about active participation and involvement of the people in the Plan processes, which included Plan formulation implementation and monitoring. The Second Five Year Plan attempted to cover the entire countryside with National Extensive Service Blocks through the institutions of Block Development Officers, Assistant Development Officers, Village Level Workers, in addition to nominated representatives of village panchayats of that area and some other popular organisations like co-operative societies. But the plan failed to satisfactorily accomplish decentralisation. Hence, committees were constituted by various authorities to advise the Centre on different aspects of decentralisation.
The Balwant Rai Mehta Committee (1957).
In 1957, Balwant Rai Mehta Committee studied the Community Development Projects and the National Extension Service and assessed the extent to which the movement had succeeded in utilising local initiatives and in creating institutions to ensure continuity in the process of improving economic and social conditions in rural areas. The Committee held that community development would only be deep and enduring when the community was involved in the planning, decision-making and implementation process.
The suggestions were for as follows:-
The PRI structure did not develop the requisite democratic momentum and failed to cater to the needs of rural development. There are various reasons for such an outcome which include political and bureaucratic resistance at the state level to share power and resources with local level institutions, domination of local elites over the major share of the benefits of welfare schemes, lack of capability at the local level and lack of political will.
that much of the developmental functions at the district level
would be played by the panchayats.
The states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal passed new legislation based on this report. However, the flux in politics at the state level did not allow these institutions to develop their own political dynamics.
G.V.K. Rao Committee (1985).
The G.V.K. Rao Committee was appointed to once again look at various aspects of PRIs. The Committee was of the opinion that a total view of rural development must be taken in which PRIs must play a central role in handling people's problems. It recommended the following:-
L.M.Singhvi Committee (1986).
L.M. Singhvi Committee studied panchayati raj. The Gram Sabha was considered as the base of a decentralised democracy, and PRIs viewed as institutions of self-governance which would actually facilitate the participation of the people in the process of planning and development. It recommended:
The suggestion of giving panchayats constitutional status was opposed by the Sarkaria Commission, but the idea, however, gained momentum in the late 1980s especially because of the endorsement by the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who introduced the 64th Constitutional Amendment Bill in 1989. The 64th Amendment Bill was prepared and introduced in the lower house of Parliament. But it got defeated in the Rajya Sabha as non-convincing. He lost the general elections too. In 1989, the National Front introduced the 74th Constitutional Amendment Bill, which could not become an Act because of the dissolution of the Ninth Lok Sabha.
All these various suggestions and recommendations and means of strengthening PRIs were considered while formulating the new Constitutional Amendment Act.
The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act.
The idea which produced the 73rd Amendment was not a response to pressure from the grassroots, but to an increasing recognition that the institutional initiatives of the preceding decade had not delivered, that the extent of rural poverty was still much too large and thus the existing structure of government needed to be reformed. It is interesting to note that this idea evolved from the Centre and the state governments. It was a political drive to see PRIs as a solution to the governmental crises that India was experiencing.
The Constitutional (73rd Amendment) Act, passed in 1992 by the Narasimha Rao government, came into force on April 24, 1993. It was meant to provide constitutional sanction to establish "democracy at the grassroots level as it is at the state level or national level". Its main features are as follows:
Present scenario.
At present, there are about 3 million elected representatives at all levels of the panchayat 1/2th of which are women. These members represent more than 2.4 lakh Gram Panchayats, about 6,000 intermediate level tiers and more than 500 district panchayats. Spread over the length and breadth of the country, the new panchayats cover about 96 per cent of India's more than 5.8 lakh villages and nearly 99.6 per cent of rural population. This is the largest experiment in decentralisation of governance in the history of humanity.
The Constitution visualises panchayats as institutions of self-governance. However, giving due consideration to the federal structure of our polity, most of the financial powers and authorities to be endowed on panchayats have been left at the discretion of concerned state legislatures. Consequently, the powers and functions vested in PRIs vary from state to state. These provisions combine representative and direct democracy into a synergy and are expected to result in an extension and deepening of democracy in India. Hence, panchayats have journeyed from an institution within the culture of India to attain constitutional status.
This is one of the biggest democracy in the world where village level democratic structures are functioning for their development.

Leslie Turner

Leslie Turner (December 25, 1899 - March 2, 1988), known to his friends as Les Turner, was a syndicated comic strip writer-artist who produced the adventures of "Captain Easy" for more than three decades.
Biography.
Early life and education.
Born in Cisco, Texas, Turner grew up from age eight in Wichita Falls, Texas, where he started drawing while in high school. His grandfather was the courthouse architect and builder A. C. Swinburne, responsible for numerous courthouses across West Texas.
After serving briefly in the U.S. Army near the end of World War I, Turner began profiting from his art talent while a freshman at Southern Methodist University. He dropped out of college for one term to attend the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. While a student at SMU, Turner and his college pals would make vagabond treks around the United States during the summer months. He edited SMU's 1922 yearbook, and after his graduation that same year with an English degree, he worked at a Dallas engraving plant.
Newlyweds in New York.
While freelancing from Dallas, he sold a cartoon to "Judge". He then married Bethel Burson of Silverton, Texas, and the newlyweds headed for New York where he became a freelance illustrator with work published in a variety of magazines, including "Redbook", "Pictorial Review", "Ladies' Home Journal" and "Boys' Life". It took him two years to crack the major market, "The Saturday Evening Post", work that included illustrating the popular "Plupy" stories of Henry Shute.
Jim Ivey, curator of the Cartoon Museum in Orlando, Florida, stated, "He was one of the best magazine illustrators in the 1920s and 1930s—the Golden Age of magazine illustrating. He was a superb artist." After six years in New York, the couple and their two daughters moved in 1929 to Colorado where they ran a small sheep ranch while living in a two-story stone house constructed by Turner. Unfortunately, the freelance assignments from New York soon slowed, but their Colorado claim required them to spend three years on the ranch. After four years in Colorado, they returned to New York, where Turner found work doing advertising illustrations. 
Comic strips.
A Texas pal of Texan Roy Crane, Turner began in comics in 1937 as an assistant on Crane's "Wash Tubbs" strip. Crane recalled their youthful adventures:
When Crane moved to Orlando, the Turner family followed in 1938, living at 1218 Conway Road, where Turner designed and built all the furniture in the house.
Turner takes over.
In 1943, when Crane left to do "Buz Sawyer", Turner took over the daily "Wash Tubbs", and his signature first appeared on the strip May 31, 1943. In January 1944, Turner made comic strip history when he observed a fighter plane flying over his home in Orlando. He drew it into "Wash Tubbs", surprising the War Department. The aircraft was the Northrop P-61 Black Widow, and Turner's drawing of it appeared two days before the Army's official announcement.
In the late 1940s, Turner changed the title to "Captain Easy", taking on Walt Scott (1894–1970) as a Sunday page assistant during the 1940s and 1950s. At its peak, the strip was carried in 600 newspapers. It was noted for its scientific accuracy, and the Captain explained the binary system to readers when computers were in their infancy. In 1949, Turner did extensive research into alcoholism in order to write a strip sequence on the rehabilitation of drunkard Gig Wilty. The story arc brought Turner praise from many members of Alcoholics Anonymous. Ten years later, he researched hypnotism for a sequence timed to coincide with publicity for the movie "The Hypnotic Eye" (1960).
The Sunday strip was drawn by Mel Graff during the 1960s. In late 1969-70, Turner's assistant Bill Crooks took over the art and Jim Lawrence scripted. At the time of Turner's death in Orlando in 1988, Crooks commented, "Everything I learned about the comic strip business I learned from him."
Turner had three daughters, Ann, Joy and Toby. Ann Turner Cook found fame as the model for the Gerber Baby, trademarked art reproduced from a 1928 charcoal sketch by the Turner family's neighbor, artist Dorothy Hope Smith. Cook, who taught literature and creative writing in Tampa, Florida for 26 years, writes the Brandy O'Bannon mystery novels, including "Trace Their Shadows" and "Shadow over Cedar Key", set on Florida's Gulf Coast.
Awards.
In 1965, Turner was honored by 60 Florida cartoonists during their annual Daytona Beach gathering with a plaque presented by cartoonist Dick Hodkins, regional chairman of the National Cartoonists Society.

Rain or Shine Elasto Painters draft history

Prior to the draft, they were allowed to carry over three players from their PBL team: Jay-R Reyes, Junjun Cabatu and Jay Sagad. Furthermore, they also took part in an expansion draft in which they were able to select three players from the other PBA teams who were not protected by their clubs, acquiring Rob Wainwright, Gilbert Lao and Denver Lopez in the process. Starting at the 2005 draft, the league has limited the draft to two rounds; all undrafted players will become free agents.
Abby Santos from the University of the Philippines, Diliman became the team's first draft choice, the 10th pick in the 2006 PBA Draft, although he was not signed by the team. The immediate next pick, his schoolmate Jireh Ibañes, was the first draftee to play for the team.
Just as with other expansion teams, Welcoat had a difficult first couple of seasons, allowing them to participate in the draft lottery. Like in the National Basketball Association (NBA) Draft, a draft lottery determines which team gets the first overall draft pick, but on a much smaller scale; only the two worst-performing teams in the preceding season participate. The team with the worst record has a 67% chance of clinching the #1 seed while the second-worst only gets a 33% chance.
In Rain or Shine's eight seasons in the league, they were able to select two number one overall draft picks: Joe Devance from the University of Texas, El Paso and Gabe Norwood from George Mason University. Devance was awarded as a member of the league's all-rookie team in 2008, while Norwood was adjudged unanimously as the Rookie of the Year.

Rumpler G.I

The Rumpler G.I was a bomber aircraft produced in Germany during World War I, together with refined versions known as the G.II and G.III. 
Design and development.
Based on a prototype with the factory designation 4A15, the G.I and its successors were built to a conventional bomber design for their time, two-bay biplanes with unstaggered wings of unequal span. The pilot sat in an open cockpit just forward of the wings, and open positions were provided the nose and amidships for a gunner and observer. The engines were mounted pusher-fashion in nacelles atop the lower wings and enclosed in streamlined cowlings. Fixed tricycle undercarriage was fitted, with dual wheels on each unit. 
The G.II version was almost identical, but featured more powerful engines and carried a second 7.92 mm (.312 in) machine gun and increased bombload. The G.III was again similar, but had engine nacelles that were now mounted on short struts clear of the lower wing.

GNU Gatekeeper

The GNU Gatekeeper (abbreviated as GnuGk) is an open-sourced project that implements an H.323 Gatekeeper based on the OpenH323 or H323Plus stack. A gatekeeper provides address translation, admissions control, call routing, authorization and accounting services to an H.323 system defined on the H.323 standard by ITU-T.
Features.
GnuGk contains a rich set of features, including:
License.
It is covered by the GNU General Public License. Besides, the authors explicitly grant the right to link it to the OpenH323 and OpenSSL libraries. This is necessary, since GNU GPL is incompatible with the licenses of these libraries.
History.
Originally, a proof-of-concept gatekeeper was developed by Xianping Chen, Joe Metzger and Rajat Todi for an experiment. At the start of 1999, Jan Willamowius convinced the first authors to license their code under GNU GPL and began the project.
The code was named "OpenH323 Gatekeeper", short "OpenH323GK". A team at mediaWays provided LDAP subsystem and overlapped sending. In 2000, there are tens of people contributed to the project for coding and testing.
At the start of 2001, Chih-Wei Huang at Citron and his team began to use and modify the project for their VoIP services. In September 2001 Openh323GK version 1.0 was released.
In 2002, GnuGk 2.0 was released. It had new architecture for gatekeeper routed mode which can handle thousands of concurrent calls, and introduced full H.323 proxy and Citron's NAT technology. These features made it a carrier-graded H.323 gatekeeper suitable for commercial operations.
To avoid confusion with other OpenH323 based gatekeepers, the project was renamed "GNU Gatekeeper", short "GnuGk", to reflect that it was the only gatekeeper available under a GNU license.
In 2004, version 2.2 was released with a redesigned architecture, followed by the more stable version 2.2.1 in 2005.
In 2006, version 2.2.4 introduced call failover, ENUM and CLI rewriting.
In 2012, version 3.0 added IPv6 and full H.460.18/H.460.19 traversal zone support. 
Compatibility.
The official website maintains an interoperability list for H.323 software and products.
Contributors.
Jan Willamowius is the project founder and maintainer .
Over the years dozens of people contributed code and bug fixes. Among the most active were the team a Mediaways (LDAP), Michal Zygmuntowicz (radius support), Chih-Wei Huang (2.2 redesign), and Simon Horne (NAT features).

Woolworths.co.uk

Woolworths.co.uk is an online retail website owned by Shop Direct Group, formed in 2009, after the demise of the high street Woolworths stores. The online store opened on 25 June 2009.
History.
Stores in Britain.
Woolworths started out in the UK in 1909 as F.W Woolworth & Co, part of the American company that was established in 1879. The first store was on Church Street in Liverpool and sold children's clothing, stationery and toys from the very beginning. Woolworths took off in the mid-1920s with stores opening as often as every two to three weeks. By 2008 there were 807 Woolworths stores. 
Woolworths return as an online retailer.
In November 2008 Woolworths Group entered administration with Deloitte, and by early January 2009 all of its stores had closed. Woolworths' financial performance had been declining in the previous few years, and the events of the closure coincided with the financial crisis and recession which was occurring at the time.
On 2 February 2009, barely a month after the last Woolworths stores closed, it was announced that the Woolworths brand in the UK, as well as the Ladybird clothing brand had been bought by Shop Direct Group, who are the owners of companies such as Littlewoods, Kays and Great Universal. "The Times" estimated that they would have paid between £5 million and £10 million for the brand. Shop Direct Group announced their intention to restart the Woolworths brand as an online retailer by the summer of 2009. The website uses the same URL as Woolworths had used under the Woolworths Group, and as of February 2009 Shop Direct were seeking input from the public about what they wanted the site to be like. It is also believed that a catalogue may follow. Woolworths also launched an Easter egg website, called "Woolies Wonderland", for Easter 2009.
On 25 June 2009, woolworths.co.uk reopened with in excess of half a million products on offer. Users of Twitter were told that they would be the first to be informed about the site's launch by Matthew Hardcastle but users were told on the morning of launch. News sources reported details of the launch the day before.
Ladybird.
Ladybird is a brand of clothing for children aged 0–13 years, that is sold by the Shop Direct Group on the Woolworths website. On 1 February 2009, Shop Direct purchased the Ladybird brand and whole rights from the administrators of Woolworths Group. The brand has a history which dates back to a trading partnership beginning in 1934 between the original firm Adolf Pasold & Son and Woolworths.

Lupus headache

Lupus headache is a proposed, specific headache disorder in patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Research shows that headache is a symptom commonly described by SLE patients —57% in one meta-analysis, ranging in different studies from 33% to 78%; of which migraine 31.7% and tension-type headache 23.5%. The existence of a special lupus headache is contested, although few high-quality studies are available to form definitive conclusions.
Definition.
Lupus headache is an important item in the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), a scoring system often used in lupus research. The SLEDAI describes lupus headache as a "severe, persistent headache; may be migrainous, but must be nonresponsive to narcotic analgesia". A score of 8 is given to this item (items are given a relative weight of 1, 2, 4 or 8).
The 1999 American College of Rheumatology case definitions of neuropsychiatric syndromes in SLE do not define lupus headache, but rather propose several headache disorders loosely based on the International Headache Society (IHS) classification.
In the IHS scheme, headache due to lupus would be classified as "Headache attributed to other non-infectious inflammatory disease" (7.3.3). This label requires evidence of a disease flare accompanying the headache, and resolution of the headache with immunosuppressant treatment. However, a meta-analysis found no correlation between headaches and disease activity.
Criticism.
Critics of this concept argue that there are no quality studies showing that headaches in patients with SLE differ from those in the general population. A detailed definition of the term lupus headache is lacking, since the terms "severe" and "persistent" are not quantified. Narcotic analgesics are not recommended for migraines or other common headache types. Other definitions from the IHS do not include responsiveness to treatments as a diagnostic criterion. Migraine patients are typically adult women around age 40, a demographic group in which SLE is also more common.
Diagnosis.
Although specific complications of SLE may cause headache (such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome), it remains unclear whether specific investigations (such as lumbar puncture or magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) are needed in lupus patients presenting with headache. Although studies using MRI or single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) often find abnormalities, the value of these findings remains unclear, and they have not been able to distinguish a special "lupus headache" from other headache types in people with lupus.
Disease mechanism.
Some (but not all) studies have shown an association between (migraine) headaches in SLE and associated Raynaud's phenomenon and/or anti-cardiolipin antibodies.
Further studies are needed however to prove the underlying assumption that cerebral vasospasm causes migraines in lupus patients.

Coswig Ferry

The Coswig Ferry, also known as the Wörlitz Coswig Ferry, is a cable ferry across the Elbe river between Coswig and Wörlitz in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. The ferry is owned by the municipality of Coswig.
The ferry crosses a distance of about , taking about 5 minutes. Technically, the ferry is a reaction ferry, which is propelled by the current of the water. The ferry is attached to a floating cable which is anchored firmly in the riverbed upstream of the ferry. To operate the ferry, it is angled into the current, causing the force of the current to swing the ferry across the river on the cable.
A ferry has operated at the site since at least 1566. The reaction principle of operation was first introduced in 1863, and has continued ever since. The current ferry boat dates back to 1934, although it has been modernised several times since then.

Oldenburg T 0

The Oldenburg Class T 0 (originally Class VIII) were goods train tank engines operated by the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg State Railways. They were built specifically for branch lines, because four-coupled engines had proved uneconomical. Their wheelbase of 7.70 m enabled them to travel at up to 60 km/h. They were considerably more economical than the four-couplers. In 1885 four were built and two more followed in 1891.

Burger Machine

Burger Machine Holdings Corporation, more commonly known as Burger Machine, is one of the notable fastfood companies in the Philippines. It is a sub-company of the Gilmore Food Corporation. Unlike Jollibee and other burger chains, Burger Machine has always been retailing in outdoor stands instead of shops.
History.
It was created in 1981 by Fe Esperanza S. Rodriguez and a sister who both planned to turn two old small buses into mobile stores, an idea they adapted from America. It was their fondness for hamburgers that inspired them to make a business that would serve for the masses. The stores were then opened near two gas stations in Quezon City. They all began with a capital of P40,000 with nearly two dozen employees working continuously. This non-stop service earned Burger Machine the nickname of "the burger that never sleeps."
A year later, a third store was opened. The company was nationally recognized.
In 1990, the Corporate Office in EDSA started and was called EDSA Business Unit. It was also in this year when the Food and Nutrition Research Institute of the Department of Science and Technology confirmed their burgers as “source of the most nutrients in terms of peso value compared to other leading hamburger chains.” 
Through the years, Burger Machine launched dozens of branches including stalls and full-scale fast food restaurants. But during the Asian Financial Crisis of the 90's, the company saw more struggles and was forced to close down several branches and restaurants. Burger Machine is now back to its roots operation which is 24/7 burger stands for the masses.
Other information.
One distinctive character associated with the company is the dwarf which appears on every outlet. For a number of years it had been unnamed. Later in 1988, it was given one, Burger Bart through a name contest.
Graphic designer/visual communicator Zeus Paredes coined the name "BURGER MACHINE" and designed the original logo and graphics on the mobile stores.
The business was widely advertised on television in the mid-1990s. Among those who helped promote it include the Philippines' late master rapper Francis Magalona and iconic band Eraserheads.
Permit controversy.
In 2007, it was revealed that a majority of Burger Machine's stores have been operating without business licenses. Because of this, the Market Development and Administration Department gave them 15 days to go with the demands lest Burger Machine as well as its parent Gilmore would undergo such consequences, specifically having those stores closed.

Edward Larkin

Edward Rennix "Teddy" Larkin (21 September 1880–25 April 1915) was an Australian parliamentarian and a national representative rugby union player who saw service in World War I and was killed in action on the first day of the Gallipoli Campaign. He was one of only two serving members of any Australian parliament to fall in World War I. He was the member for Willoughby in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from December 1913 until his death.
Early life.
Larkin was born at North Lambton, New South Wales, to William Joseph Larkin, a quarryman and his wife Mary Ann, née Rennix. His family moved to Camperdown in Sydney where the young Ted Larkin was schooled at St Benedict's Broadway, run by the Marist Brothers. For his last two years of senior schooling he boarded at St. Joseph's College, Hunters Hill, where he played in the college's 1896 first rugby XV.
After school he worked in journalism before joining the Metropolitan Police Force in 1903 as a foot-constable, later being promoted to first-constable in 1905.
Rugby union career.
He maintained an active involvement in sports after completing his schooling and participated in cricket, swimming and rugby union playing first grade with the Endeavour Rugby Club at Newtown in Sydney. In 1903 he was captain of that club and made his representative debut for New South Wales against Queensland and the touring New Zealand national rugby team before being selected for Australia in the first test of 1903 at Sydney on 15 August, against those same All Blacks. Larkin played hooker for the Australian representative side, in a pack featuring future rugby league pioneers and dual-code rugby internationals Alex Burdon, Denis Lutge and Bill Hardcastle. The Australians were soundly beaten 22-3.
Rugby league administrator.
Larkin knew and sympathised with a number of the senior rugby union players who in 1906 and 1907 became louder in their discontent with the administration of the New South Wales Rugby Union, over rejection of compensation payments for injuries and lost wages. The breakaway in Australia took place in 1908, as it had earlier in 1895 with the Northern Union in Northern England. A gifted public speaker, Larkin had continued to develop a strong sense of social justice during his years in the police force. After the financial failure of the 1908–09 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and claims of mismanagement by the League's founding fathers James Joseph Giltinan, cricketer Victor Trumper and Labor politician Henry Hoyle, the pioneer code looked to be in jeopardy before it had barely begun.
In June 1909 Larkin left the police force and was appointed the first full-time secretary of the almost bankrupt New South Wales Rugby League. He was an excellent organizer and had success in promoting the new game evidenced by the crowd of 42,000 who filled the Agricultural Oval in June 1910 to see the Australia v Great Britain Test. During his administration which lasted till 1913, he convinced the Catholic education hierarchy and the Marist Brothers in particular to adopt rugby league as their winter sporting game. The code benefits from this legacy to this day in New South Wales and Queensland.
Parliamentary career.
In December 1913 Larkin stood as the Australian Labor Party candidate for the conservative seat of Willoughby winning 51.61% of the vote in a second ballot. He was living at Milsons Point at the time and became the first Labor Member of Parliament elected from the north side of the harbor. He was appointed as the government representative on the board of the Royal North Shore Hospital and was vocal in his support for proposal to build a bridge across Sydney Harbour Larkin was the member for Willoughby in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from December 1913 until his death.
Active service and death.
Ted Larkin's promising career was cut short with the outbreak of World War I on 4 August 1914. Demonstrating a patriotic fervor Larkin enlisted within ten days of war's declaration joining C Company of the 1st Battalion, 1st Brigade (New South Wales) of the First Australian Imperial Force's 1st Division. In his final address to the NSW Parliament, on 18 August 1914, Larkin said, "I cannot engage in the work of recruiting and urge others to enlist unless I do so myself. Gray quotes a brief poem published in the "Sydney Sun" in 1918 acclaiming Larkin for his virtue in enlisting.
The battalion left Australia in October 1914, arriving in Egypt on 2 December. Larkin's brother Martin also embarked on the Transport A19 Afric for Egypt where Ted, a sergeant was active in promoting games of rugby league amongst the troops.
The battalion landed at Anzac Cove at dawn on 25 April 1915 as part of the second and third waves. It took part in the desperate struggle for the dominating hill known as Baby 700. The Turks wrested control of the hill and counter-attacked to drive the Australians from the high ground. That afternoon Ted Larkin died in a hail of machine gun fire. Heads and Middleton quote from the war memoir "Imperishable Anzacs"' by Harold Cavill ""Wounded and dying he lay, yet when the stretcher-bearers came to carry him in, he waved them on, saying 'There's plenty worse than me out there'. Later they found him dead"". His brother Martin aged 37 also lost his life that day on the heights above Anzac Cove. Neither body was recovered until the burial Armistice of 24 May but there is no known grave for either of the Larkin brothers and their names are recorded on the Lone Pine Memorial commemorating 4,934 Australian and New Zealand troops killed in the sector who have no known grave.
In memoriam.
Confirmation of Larkin's death didn't reach Australia until June, whereupon a requiem mass was celebrated at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney attended by many distinguished citizens including the Premier and the Governor of New South Wales. Ted and Martin were both awarded posthumously the 1914-15 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.
The 1915 Sydney rugby league City Cup grand final was held as a testimonial for Ted Larkin's widow and sons and raised £171. The St Joseph's College Old Boys' Union set up the Sergeant Larkin Bursary to help finance his sons fees at the College. The family eventually declined the offer but the bursary has survived to this day as the Old Boys' Bursary.
On 30 November 1915, in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, the Speaker unveiled a commemorative tablet in honour of Lieutenant-Colonel George Braund, Member for Armidale and Sergeant Edward Rennix Larkin, Member for Willoughby who both fell at Gallipoli. The plaque reads:

Siedlisko () is a village on the Oder river in Nowa Sól County, Lubusz Voivodeship, in western Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Siedlisko. It lies approximately south-east of Nowa Sól and south-east of Zielona Góra.
The castle of "Sedlischo" was first mentioned in a 1298 deed, when the Silesian duke Henry III of Głogów acquired it from the castellans at Bytom Odrzański. After the Duchy of Głogów had become a Bohemian fief in 1331, it was seized by the royal House of Luxembourg, who enfeoffed several noble families with Siedlisko. In 1561 the lordship passed to Fabian von Schoenaich, whose nephew Georg had the Renaissance Carolath Castle built and received the title of a "Freiherr" (Baron) from Emperor Rudolf II of Habsburg. In 1697 the Schoenaich possessions around Carolath and Bytom Odrzański were raised to the status of a Bohemian state country by decree of Emperor Leopold I of Habsburg.
The Schoenaichs retained their estates even after the annexation of Silesia by King Frederick II of Prussia in 1742. Freiherr Hans Carl, a devoted Protestant, immediately paid homage to the new ruler and in turn received the title of a Prince of Carolath-Beuthen. The castle burnt down after the Red Army had occupied the area at the end of World War II. A Renaissance gate building and a mausoleum designed by Hans Poelzig in 1912 are preserved.

Kłopot, Lubusz Voivodeship

Kłopot (literally: "trouble"; ) is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Cybinka, within Słubice County, Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland close to the border with Germany.
Geography.
It lies near the eastern banks of the Oder river opposite the German town of Eisenhüttenstadt, approximately south-west of Cybinka, south of Słubice, west of Zielona Góra, and south-west of Gorzów Wielkopolski. 
Kłopot is known for its high number of resident White Storks. The village has a population of about 160.
History.
The settlement in former Lubusz Land was first mentioned in a 1350 deed issued by the Wittelsbach margrave Louis I of Brandenburg, who granted the Neumark estates to the Order of Saint John. Plans to connect the village to the Lusatian town of Fürstenberg west of the Oder (today part of Eisenhüttenstadt) similar to Frankfurt/Oder - Słubice had existed since Charles IV of Luxembourg became the sole ruler of both territories in 1373.
The building of a bridge was not finished until 1919; it was blown up by retiring Wehrmacht troops on 4 February 1945 after the Red Army had reached the river in the course of the Vistula-Oder Offensive. After World War II the area together with the Neumark fell to Poland (see "Territorial changes of Poland after World War II").

Szydłów () is an abandoned village in the administrative district of Gmina Cybinka, within Słubice County, Lubusz Voivodeship, in western Poland, close to the German border.
The settlement arose from a castle near the confluence of the Oder and Neisse rivers. In 1249 the Silesian Duke Bolesław II the Bald of Legnica granted it to the Lusatian margrave Henry III the Illustrious from the House of Wettin, in turn for his mediation in the inheritance conflict with his brother Duke Henry III the White of Wrocław. Schiedlo remained a village at the northeastern edge of Lower Lusatia, the only one east of the Oder River. From 1319 on it was a possession of Neuzelle Abbey.
With Lower Lusatia, it fell to Saxony by the 1635 Peace of Prague and to Prussia according to the Final Act of the 1815 Vienna Congress. Incorporated into the Province of Brandenburg, the area fell to the Republic of Poland with the 1945 implementation of the Oder–Neisse line (see "Territorial changes of Poland after World War II"). However, the village had already been abandoned in the early 20th century due to repeated floodings.

Wuhan Sports University

Wuhan Sports University (), formerly translated as Wuhan Institute of Physical Education, (WIPE), is a tertiary educational institution in China. According to the statistics released by the Ministry of Education of China, the university is one of the four leading universities in the physical education area in China. The university has many world famous alumni, such as gymnast Cheng Fei, who won more than 19 gold medals including an Olympic one. And this can be better illustrated during Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, when WIPE alumni alone won 6 gold medals, 2 silver medals and 3 bronze medals.
Wuhan Sports University is located in Hubei Province's capital Wuhan, known as "the thoroughfare leading to nine provinces". It has two campuses which are Majiazhuang Campus() and Canglong Campus.
History.
Wuhan Sports University's origins can be traced back to Zhongnan Institute of Physical Education, in Nanchang City, Jiangxi province. The Zhongnan Institute was formed in 1953. Shortly after, in 1955, the institute moved to its present site in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and changed its name to the Wuhan Institute of Physical Education (WIPE) in February 1956. WIPE was formerly administered by the National General Administration of Sports and, now it turned to be under the administration of both the National General Administration of Sports and the Hubei Provincial Government in the year 2001. In the year 1985, WIPE started its first art major; Sport Management. Since then several other art majors emerged, such as sport psychology, sport English and so forth， till the newest Sport Advertising. And this is a quintessence of ongoing reform of Tertiary educational institutions in China, whose aim is to combine USSR-style specific school into comprehensive institution.
Academics.
WIPE now has 8 colleges, 2 faculties, 3 departments and 2 schools, 15 educational and teaching units in total. The names of these units are listed as follow:
Since 2006, WIPE launched its 3+1 cooperative education project with University of the West of England. Students enrolled as its "3+1" project participants will study at Wuhan for the first 3 years and then go to UWE for the last year of study. In autumn semester of 2009, the first 15 students participated in the 3+1 project in 2006 were sent to UWE. WIPE was largely aimed for education of undergraduate level, and its graduate school, though famous in a time during 1980s, was increasingly eclipsed by Beijing Sports University. However, in 2006, WIPE was authorized for the conferment of doctor's degree; and in August 2010, Ministry of Education listed WIPE as one of universities whose students can enrol directly in graduate school without taking exams.
School Assets.
In the year 2009, the fixed assets of WIPE were about 760 million yuan. Throughout the Majiazhuang Campus, there are 12 dormitory buildings, and is constructing the 13th one.
Natatorium.
WIPE's indoor swimming pool, constructed in 1984 and put into service since 1986, is a combination of public and competition pool. The pool is maintained in constant temperature. It was then the largest swimming pool in China equipped with solar heating system, which were able to heat 70 tons of hot water daily according to its original design. Affiliated to and overseen by teaching and researching section of swimming in WIPE, the Swimming pool have been run by a private contractor., especially in summer. Athletes here have competed in different level of swimming event as well as less publicized fin swimming competition, having attained phenomenal accomplishments such as 10 world champions. There were 6 world records, 4 Asian records and 5 national records kept here.
Recently criticisms arose in the local media concerning the health regulation in swimming pool, including WIPE's natatorium. Critics said local swimming pools lacked proper sanitation of water, and inadequately checked Health Certificate of visitors as was required by law. One of the employees here contended that
Roughly Translated as: With limited wherewithal, a doctor can't be afforded; moreover, according to intra-industry hidden rules, there is no need of Health Certificate beforehand to swim. 
Present.
Wuhan Sports University has a total staff of 812, of which over 500 are professional teachers and trainers. This includes over 60 are professors, researchers and national trainers; 165 are associate professors; 3 posts are for Chutian Scholar visiting professors; 10 are Hubei Outstanding Contributions Experts; 10 experts get the subsidy of the State Council and provincial government. In the teachers, 13.8% have doctor degree, 49.8% have master or higher degree. On October 2009, Prof.Walter Brehm, the dean of the Sport Institute of University of Bayreuth of Germany, was provided a visiting professor tenure.
At Wuhan Sports University, there are all kinds of indoors and outdoors sports buildings, classrooms buildings, and
advanced research facilities. Furthermore, books in the library are up to more than 800,000 volumes.

2009 Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles season

The 2009 Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles season was the 60th in the club's history. They competed in the National Rugby League's 2009 Telstra Premiership and finished the regular season the 5th (out of 16). The Sea Eagles were then knocked out in the first week of the play-offs by eventual premiers, the Melbourne Storm.
Season summary.
As 2008 NRL premiers, Manly-Warringah started their season with the World Club Challenge match in England against Super League's 2008 champions, the Leeds Rhinos. They defeated the Rhinos 28 - 20, putting an end to England club football's 5-year hold on the World Club Challenge trophy before preparing for the start of the 2009 NRL season.
Sea Eagles star player Brett Stewart was accused of a sexual assault with a 17-year-old girl, this coming the same day after Manly's infamous season launch on 6 March, where it was believed Stewart got drunk. The NRL suspended Stewart until Round 5 of the competition, but he was still allowed to train with the club. As a result, the club started their premiership defence poorly, with four consecutive losses seeing them at last place after round four. They won their fifth round match so they were the last team to record their first win of the season, against the Wests Tigers. Upon Stewart's return he scored 3 tries in the Sea Eagles' first win of the season. Stewart was exonerated over his sexual assault charge in September 2010.
Stewart only played four further matches in the 2009 season; he suffered a knee injury in the Sea Eagles' round six victory over the South Sydney Rabbitohs and missed a great deal of football. He returned in round 25, just in time for Manly's charge to the finals; after the Sea eagles initially struggled without him on the field. Manly were eliminated in the first round of finals, going down 40-12 to the Melbourne Storm at Etihad Stadium despite finishing fifth at the end of the regular season. Losses to two of the top three teams were the reasons for Manly's early exit, ending their premiership defence in disappointment.

Takatof

The Takatof Programme for Social Volunteering is a nationwide volunteering initiative in the United Arab Emirates. It is one of the principal initiatives of the Emirates Foundation, a charitable organisation established in 2005 in the UAE under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and the Deputy Supreme Commander of UAE Armed Forces. Takatof was launched in Abu Dhabi in April 2007 with an inaugural school renovation event.
Takatof is working to create a culture of volunteering throughout the UAE. It offers all residents of the country an opportunity to volunteer in an Emirati environment through activities that promote community involvement, national identity and citizenship.
Mission.
Takatof’s mission is to mobilize people and resources throughout the UAE to find creative and sustainable solutions for proven community needs. Takatof particularly offers young people meaningful opportunities to volunteer for humanitarian, social and community programmes.
Objectives.
In promoting volunteering, Takatof seeks participation by citizens and all those living in the UAE, with special emphasis on young people as volunteers.
Core Values.
Takatof’s core values are at the heart of everything done including:
Takatof Projects.
This programme gives volunteers unique opportunities for semi-skilled work in revamping schools – painting, cleaning, gardening and site cleaning, as well as replacing furniture and modernizing library and laboratory facilities. This project is implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Education, Abu Dhabi Education Council and related institutions.
Volunteers for this programme perform highly useful health and administrative activities at hospitals and health centres, such as providing personal support, guidance and other services for patients, as well as receiving visitors and helping nursing staff.
Participation in this programme provides frequent opportunities for volunteers to utilize their leisure time through voluntary work for people with special needs. This develops their skills and life experience through humanitarian action, in collaboration with the various UAE centres for special needs.
This annual programme enables volunteers to list the needs of needy and disadvantage families before the beginning of the Islamic Holy Month of Ramadan, in order to provide nominated families with supplementary food, school and health needs. The volunteers also teach the culture of saving, in order to help the families to improve their living conditions.
This project was initiated as a follow up to the Takatof – Ramadan project (above) in which Takatof conducts case studies of families who have benefited from the Ramadan project, to assess their actual needs. The most recent survey was conducted by Takatof volunteers. It showed that house renovation has become the major requirement for most families living in the Northern Emirates.
This programme offers volunteers an opportunity to develop their skills and experiences outside the country, while taking part in socially responsible activities. This initiative is based on extensive cooperation with major partners who are well respected for their volunteering expertise on a global level.

Richard Middleton (died 1641) was a Church of England clergyman and writer who served as Archdeacon of Cardigan and chaplain to Charles, Prince of Wales (later King Charles I).
Life.
Middleton obtained a BA degree from Jesus College, Oxford in 1586. He was ordained and became vicar of Llanarthne, Carmarthenshire in south Wales, and then in 1589 obtained two posts in the diocese of St David's: prebend of Brecon and archdeacon of Cardigan. (He may have been the son of Marmaduke Middleton, Bishop of St Davids, who died in 1593.) He also served as vicar of Tenby from 1617 to 1624. He was nominated to become vicar of Leeds in 1614, which caused considerable dispute since there was another candidate backed by leading parishioners and by Tobias Matthew, the Archbishop of York. The Court of Chancery ruled against Middleton. He had, meanwhile, been appointed chaplain to Charles, Prince of Wales (later King Charles I). He wrote "The Carde and Compasse of Life" in 1613, a manual of advice to the prince. A later work, "The Heavenly Progresse" (1617) contained further advice to Charles that a good prince was not above the law, using quotations from classical authors to justify his reasoning. His other works included "The Key of David" (1619) and "Goodness the Blessed Man's Badge (1619).
He remained Archdeacon of Cardigan in 1629 when he exchanged positions with William Parker to become rector of Ecton, Northamptonshire – a well-rewarded position. His wife, Margaret, was buried in Ecton in 1635; there is nothing to show that they had children. He died on 16 November 1641, and was also buried in Ecton.

Plot.
With Fawn's prompting, Dag seeks out a teacher. A powerful groundsetter at local New Moon Cutoff Camp could be the answer to his prayers, but conflicts arise between the insular Lakewalker traditions and Dag's determination to be a healer for farmers. Dag, Fawn, Arkady the groundsetter and others embark on a long journey by wagon. They are joined by several other characters, some Lakewalker, some farmer, including Fawn's brother, Whit, and his wife, Berry. On their way up the Trace, a long wagon road, they encounter a malice, an evil being with great power. A Lakewalker kills the malice with a sharing knife. Fawn guesses that this malice was fleeing something even more powerful. That turns out to be a second malice. That malice is killed by Whit, aided by Fawn and Berry, which is unprecedented—no farmer has ever killed a malice without Lakewalker aid before.
At the end of the book, Dag and Fawn's vision of closer cooperation and understanding between Lakewalkers and farmers, as partners, is beginning to be achieved.

Clarice Bean series

The Clarice Bean series is a series of children's books written and illustrated by the English author Lauren Child from 1999. The main character is Clarice Bean and the stories feature her challenges navigating the complex ethical and social questions children deal with at school and at home. 
A spin-off "Ruby Redfort series" was inaugurated in 2011, which the US publisher called a "six-book middlegrade fiction series" in advance.
Books.
Both "That's Me" and "What Planet?" were bronze runners-up for the Smarties Prize in ages category 6–8 years and the latter won the Kids Club category.
"That's Me" was also a highly commended runner-up for the Kate Greenaway Medal, the annual British Library Association award for children's book illustration.
"Utterly Me" was the first novel in the series and one of 39 books nominated by the librarians for the Carnegie Medal, companion to the Greenaway.
"Trouble" made the shortlists for both the British Children's Book of the Year and the Red House Children's Book Award.
Family.
Clarice Bean's family: 
The books do not specify the ages of anyone but Minal. Kurt is the oldest child followed by Marcie, Clarice, and then Minal is the youngest.
Other characters.
People at school may be divided in two groups.
Betty P. Moody.
Betty Moody is Clarice Bean's best friend, and they do most things together. As well as Clarice herself Betty loves the Ruby Redfort series. Betty also loves dogs and in the 1st book she got a dog from Clarice's grandad's best friend. She appears in the series wearing glasses. She and her parents travel a lot. In the last book she moved to San Francisco.
Karl Wrenbury.

He also is always a trouble maker and gets into trouble a lot at school by Mrs. Wilberton their class teacher. He is often sent to Mr.Pickering's office for his bad behavior. In one of the books, he throws his chair across the room.
Grace Grapello.
Grace is mainly Clarice Bean's worst enemy. She can be very mean to Clarice Bean for no particular reason, especially about her spelling. She is good at just about everything and people say she is Mrs. Wilberton's 'Teacher's dreamy girl'. Mrs. Wilberton never believes Clarice Bean but she always believes Grace. Grace also is the teachers pet.
Mrs Wilberton.

<doc id="21364732" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21364732" title="History of Panama (to 1821)">
History of Panama (to 1821)

In the history of Panama, the earliest known inhabitants were the Cueva and Coclé tribes, but they were drastically reduced by disease and fighting when the Spanish arrived in the 16th century. But some moved out of Panama to have children and increase population.
Rodrigo de Bastidas, sailing westward from Venezuela in 1501 in search of gold, was the first European to explore the Isthmus of Panama. A year later, Christopher Columbus visited the Isthmus and established a short-lived settlement in the Darién. Vasco Núñez de Balboa's torturous trek from the Atlantic to the Pacific in 1513 demonstrated that the Isthmus was, indeed, the path between the seas, and Panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of Spain's empire in the New World. Gold and silver were brought by ship from South America, hauled across the Isthmus, and loaded aboard ships for Spain. The route became known as the Camino Real, or Royal Road, although it was more commonly known as Camino de Cruces (Road of the Crosses) because the road led to the TOWN of Venta Cruces located on the Rio Chagres.
Panama was part of the Spanish empire for nearly 300 years, from 1538 to 1821. From the outset, Panamanian identity was based on a sense of "geographic destiny", and Panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the Isthmus. The colonial experience also spawned Panamanian nationalism as well as a racially complex and highly stratified society, the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalism.
Indigenous Panama.
Estimates vary greatly of the number of Indians who inhabited the isthmus when the Spanish explorers arrived. By some accounts, the population was considerably greater than that of contemporary Panama. Some Panamanian historians have suggested that there might have been a population of 500,000 Indians from some sixty "tribes", but other researchers have concluded that the Cuna alone numbered some 750,000.
Besides the Cuna, which constituted by far the largest group in the area, two other major groups, the Guaymí and the Chocó, have been identified by ethnologists. The Guaymí, of the highlands near the Costa Rican border, are believed to be related to Indians of the Nahuatlan and Mayan nations of Mexico and Central America. The Chocó on the Pacific side of Darién Province appear to be related to the Chibcha of Colombia.
Although the Cuna, now found mostly in the Comarca de San Blas, an indigenous territory or reserve considered part of Colón Province for some official purposes, have been categorized as belonging to the Caribbean culture, their origin continues to be a subject of speculation. Various ethnologists have indicated the possibility of a linguistic connection between the name Cuna and certain Arawak and Carib tribal names. The possibility of cultural links with the Andean Indians has been postulated, and some scholars have noted linguistic and other affinities with the Chibcha. The implication in terms of settlement patterns is that the great valleys of Colombia, which trend toward the isthmus, determined migration in that direction.
Lines of affiliation have also been traced to the Cueva and Coiba tribes, although some anthropologists suggest that the Cuna might belong to a largely extinct linguistic group. Some Cuna believe themselves to be of Carib stock, while others trace their origin to creation by the god Olokkuppilele at Mount Tacarcuna, west of the mouth of the Río Atrato in Colombia.
Among all three Indian groups — the Cuna, Guaymí, and Chocó — land was communally owned and farmed. In addition to hunting and fishing, the Indians raised corn, cotton, cacao, various root crops and other vegetables, and fruits. They lived then — as many still do — in circular thatched huts and slept in hammocks. Villages specialized in producing certain goods, and traders moved among them along the rivers and coastal waters in dugout canoes. The Indians were skillful potters, stonecutters, goldsmiths, and silversmiths. The ornaments they wore, including breastplates and earrings of beaten gold, reinforced the Spanish myth of El Dorado, the city of gold.
The conquest.
Rodrigo de Bastidas, a wealthy notary public from Seville, was the first of many Spanish explorers to reach the isthmus. Sailing westward from Venezuela in 1501 in search of gold, he explored some 150 kilometers of the coastal area before heading for the West Indies. A year later, Christopher Columbus, on his fourth voyage to the New World, touched several points on the isthmus. One was a horseshoe-shaped harbor that he named "Puerto Bello" (beautiful port), later renamed Portobelo.
Vasco Núñez de Balboa, a member of Bastidas's crew, had settled in Hispaniola (present-day Dominican Republic and Haiti) but stowed away on a voyage to Panama in 1510 to escape his creditors. At that time, about 800 Spaniards lived on the isthmus, but soon the many jungle perils, doubtless including malaria and yellow fever, had killed all but 60 of them. Finally, the settlers at Antigua del Darién (Antigua), the first city to be duly constituted by the Spanish crown, deposed the crown's representative and elected Balboa and Martin Zamudio co-mayors.
Balboa proved to be a good administrator. He insisted that the settlers plant crops rather than depend solely on supply ships, and Antigua became a prosperous community. Like other conquistadors, Balboa led raids on Indian settlements, but unlike most, he proceeded to befriend the conquered tribes. He took the daughter of a chief as his lifelong mistress.
On September 1, 1513, Balboa set out with 190 Spaniards — among them Francisco Pizarro, who later conquered the Inca Empire in Peru — a pack of dogs, and 1,000 Indian slaves. After twenty-five days of hacking their way through the jungle, the party gazed on the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean. Balboa, clad in full armor, waded into the water and claimed the sea and all the shores on which it washed for his God and his king.
Balboa returned to Antigua in January 1514 with all 190 soldiers and with cotton cloth, pearls, and 40,000 pesos in gold. Meanwhile, Balboa's enemies had denounced him in the Spanish court, and King Ferdinand appointed a new governor for the colony, then known as Castilla de Oro. The new governor, Pedro Arias de Avila, who became known as "Pedrarias the Cruel", charged Balboa with treason. In 1517 Balboa was arrested, brought to the court of Pedrarias, and executed.
In 1519 Pedrarias moved his capital away from the debilitating climate and unfriendly Indians of the Darién to a fishing village on the Pacific coast (about four kilometers east of the present-day capital). The Indians called the village "Panama", meaning "plenty of fish." In the same year, Nombre de Dios, a deserted early settlement, was resettled and until the end of the 16th century served as the Caribbean port for trans-isthmian traffic. A trail known as the Camino Real, or royal road, linked Panama and Nombre de Dios. Along this trail, traces of which can still be followed, gold from Peru was carried by muleback to Spanish galleons waiting on the Atlantic coast.
The increasing importance of the isthmus for transporting treasure and the delay and difficulties posed by the Camino Real inspired surveys ordered by the Spanish crown in the 1520s and 1530s to ascertain the feasibility of constructing a canal. The idea was finally abandoned in mid-century by King Philip II (1556–98), who concluded that if God had wanted a canal there, He would have built one.
Pedrarias's governorship proved to be disastrous. Hundreds of Spaniards died of disease and starvation in their brocaded silk clothing; thousands of Indians were robbed, enslaved, and massacred. Thousands more of the Indians succumbed to European diseases to which they had no natural immunity. After the atrocities of Pedrarias, most of the Indians fled to remote areas to avoid the Spaniards.
The regulations for colonial administration set forth by the Spanish king's Council of the Indies decreed that the Indians were to be protected and converted to Christianity. The colonies, however, were far from the seat of ultimate responsibility, and few administrators were guided by the humane spirit of those regulations. The Roman Catholic Church, and particularly the Franciscan order, showed some concern for the welfare of the Indians, but on the whole, church efforts were inadequate to the situation.
The Indians, nevertheless, found one effective benefactor among their Spanish oppressors. Bartolomé de las Casas, the first priest ordained in the West Indies, was outraged by the persecution of the Indians. He freed his own slaves, returned to Spain, and persuaded the council to adopt stronger measures against enslaving the Indians. He made one suggestion that he later regretted—that Africans, whom the Spaniards considered less than human, be imported toreplace the Indians as slaves.
In 1517 King Charles V (1516–56) granted a concession for exporting 4,000 African slaves to the Antilles. Thus the slave trade began and flourished for more than 200 years. Panama was a major distribution point for slaves headed elsewhere on the mainland. The supply of Indian labor had been depleted by the mid-16th century, however, and Panama began to absorb many of the slaves. A large number of slaves on the isthmus escaped into the jungle. They became known as "cimarrones", meaning wild or unruly, because they attacked travelers along the Camino Real. An official census of Panama City in 1610 listed 548 citizens, 303 women, 156 children, 146 mulattoes, 148 Antillean blacks, and 3,500 African slaves.
The Spanish colony.
The period of free, though licensed, exploration gave way to a period in which the king exercised royal control by appointing governors and their staffs. All were to be paid from crown revenues expected from the royal profits on the colony. The king's representative was responsible for ensuring such returns; he tracked all gold, pearls, and income from trade and conquest; he weighed out and safeguarded the king's share.
Governors had some summary powers of justice, but "audiencias " (courts) were also established. The first such "audiencia", in Santo Domingo, Hispaniola, had jurisdiction over the whole area of conquest. As settlement spread, other "audiencias" were set up. By a decree of 1538, all Spanish territory from Nicaragua to Cape Horn was to be administered from an "audiencia" in Panama. This "audiencia" lasted only until 1543 because of the impossibility of exercising jurisdiction over so vast an area. A new Panamanian "audiencia", with jurisdiction over an area more nearly coinciding with the territory of present-day Panama, was established in 1563. The viceroy's position was revived for the rich empires of Mexico and Peru. After 1567 Panama was attached to the Viceroyalty of Peru but retained its own "audiencia".
Beginning early in the 16th century, Nombre de Dios in Panama, Vera Cruz in Mexico, and Cartagena in Colombia were the only three ports in Spanish America authorized by the crown to trade with the homeland. By the mid-1560s, the system became regularized, and two fleets sailed annually from Spain, one to Mexico, and the other to southern ports. These fleets would then rendezvous at Havana and return together to Cádiz, Spain. In principle, this rigid system remained in effect until the 18th century. From the middle of the 17th century, however, as the strength and prosperity of Spain declined, annual visits became the exception.
Shipments of bullion and goods were to be delivered to Panama on the Pacific side for transport over the isthmus and return to Spain. Panama's own contribution to the loading of the fleet was relatively small. Gold production was never great, and little exportable surplus of agricultural and forest products was available. Nothing was manufactured; in fact, Spain discouraged the production of finished goods. The colony's prosperity, therefore, fluctuated with the volume of trade, made up largely of Peruvian shipments. When the Inca gold was exhausted, great quantities of silver mined in Peru replaced gold in trade for 150 years, supplemented eventually by sugar, cotton, wine, indigo, cinchona, vanilla, and cacao.
Except for traffic in African slaves, foreign trade was forbidden unless the goods passed through Spain. Africans were brought to the colonies on contract ("asiento") by Portuguese, English, Dutch, and French slavers, who were forbidden to trade in any other commodities. Spanish efforts to retain their monopoly on the rich profits from trade with their colonies provided a challenge to the rising maritime nations of Europe. Intermittent maritime warfare resulted in the Caribbean and later in the Pacific. The first serious interference with trade came from the English.
From 1572 to 1597, Francis Drake was associated with most of the assaults on Panama. Drake's activities demonstrated the indefensibility of the open roadstead of Nombre de Dios. In 1597 the Atlantic terminus of the trans-isthmian route was moved to Portobelo, one of the best natural harbors anywhere on the Spanish Main (the mainland of Spanish America).
Despite raids on shipments and ports, the registered legal import of precious metals increased threefold between 1550 and 1600. Panama's prosperity was at its peak during the first part of the 17th century. This was the time of the famous "ferias" (fairs, or exchange markets) of Portobelo, where European merchandise could be purchased to supply the commerce of the whole west coast south of Nicaragua. When a feria ended, Portobelo would revert to its quiet existence as a small seaport and garrison town.
Panama City also flourished on the profits of trade. Following reconstruction after a serious fire in 1644, contemporary accounts credit Panama City with 1,400 residences "of all types" (probably including slave huts); most business places, religious houses, and substantial residences were rebuilt of stone. Panama City was considered, after Mexico City and Lima, the most beautiful and opulent settlement in the West Indies.
Interest in a canal project was revived early in the 17th century by Philip III of Spain (1598–1621). The Council of the Indies dissuaded the king, arguing that a canal would draw attack from other European nations—an indication of the decline of Spanish sea power.
During the first quarter of the 17th century, trade between Spain and the isthmus remained undisturbed. At the same time, England, France, and the Netherlands, one or all almost constantly at war with Spain, began seizing colonies in the Caribbean. Such footholds in the West Indies encouraged the development of the buccaneers—English, French, Dutch, and Portuguese adventurers who preyed on Spanish shipping and ports with the tacit or open support of their governments. Because of their numbers and the closeness of their bases, the buccaneers were more effective against Spanish trade than the English had been during the previous century.
The volume of registered precious metal arriving in Spain fell from its peak in 1600; by 1660 volume was less than the amount registered a century before. Depletion of Peruvian mines, an increase in smuggling, and the buccaneers were causes of the decline.
Henry Morgan, a buccaneer who had held Portobelo for ransom in 1668, returned to Panama with a stronger force at the end of 1670. On January 29, 1671, Morgan appeared at Panama City. With 1,400 men he defeated the garrison of 2,600 in pitched battle outside the city, which he then looted. The officials and citizens fled, some to the country and others to Peru, having loaded their ships with the most important church and government funds and treasure. Panama City was destroyed by fire, probably from blown up powder stores, although the looters were blamed. After 4 weeks, Morgan left with 175 mule loads of loot and 600 prisoners. Two years later, a new city was founded at the location of the present-day capital and was heavily fortified.
The buccaneer scourge rapidly declined after 1688 mainly because of changing European alliances. By this time Spain was chronically bankrupt; its population had fallen; and it suffered internal government mismanagement and corruption.
Influenced by buccaneer reports about the ease with which the isthmus could be crossed—which suggested the possibility of digging a canal—William Paterson, founder and ex-governor of the Bank of England, organized a Scottish company to establish a colony in the San Blas area. Paterson landed on the Caribbean coast of the Darién late in 1698 with about 1,200 persons. Although well received by the Indians (as was anyone not Spanish), the colonists were poorly prepared for life in the tropics with its attendant diseases. Their notion of trade goods—European clothing, wigs, and English Bibles—was of little interest to the Indians. These colonists gave up after six months, unknowingly passing at sea reinforcements totaling another 1,600 people. The Spanish reacted to these new arrivals by establishing a blockade from the sea. The English capitulated and left in April 1700, having lost many lives, mostly from malnutrition and disease.
In Spain Bourbon kings replaced the Habsburgs in 1700, and some liberalization of trade was introduced. These measures were too late for Panama, however. Spain's desperate efforts to maintain its colonial trade monopoly had been self-defeating. Cheaper goods supplied by England, France, and the Netherlands were welcomed by colonial officials and private traders alike. Dealing in contraband increased to the detriment of official trade. Fewer merchants came to the Portobelo "feria" to pay Spain's inflated prices because the foreign suppliers furnished cheaper goods at any port at which they could slip by or bribe the coastal guards. The situation worsened; only five of the previously annual fleets were dispatched to Latin America between 1715 and 1736, a circumstance that increased contraband operations.
Panama's temporary loss of its independent "audiencia", from 1718 to 1722, and the country's attachment to the Viceroyalty of Peru were probably engineered by powerful Peruvian merchants. They resented the venality of Panamanian officials and their ineffectiveness in suppressing the pirates (outlaws of no flag, as distinct from the buccaneers of the 17th century). Panama's weakness was further shown by its inability to protect itself against an invasion by the Miskito Indians of Nicaragua, who attacked from Laguna de Chiriquí. Another Indian uprising in the valley of the Río Tuira caused the whites to abandon the Darién.
The final blow to Panama's shrinking control of the transit trade between Latin America and Spain came before the mid-18th century. As a provision of the Treaty of Utrecht at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1713, Britain secured the right to supply African slaves to the Spanish colonies (4,800 a year for 30 years) and also to send 1 ship a year to Portobelo. The slave trade provision evidently satisfied both countries, but the trade in goods did not. Smuggling by British ships continued, and a highly organized contraband trade based in Jamaica—with the collusion of Panamanian merchants—nearly wiped out the legal trade. By 1739 the importance of the isthmus to Spain had seriously declined; Spain again suppressed Panama's autonomy by making the region part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada (encompassing present-day Colombia, Venezula, Ecuador, and Panama).
In the same year, war broke out between Britain and Spain. A British military force took Portobelo and destroyed it. Panamanian historians maintain that this attack diverted Spanish trade from the trans-isthmian route. The Seville–Cádiz monopoly of colonial trade had been breached by royal decrees earlier in the century, and precedent was thus furnished for the merchants of the Latin American colonies to agitate for direct trade with Spain and for intercolonial trade. After 1740 the Pacific coast ports were permitted to trade directly via ships rounding Cape Horn, and the Portobelo "feria" was never held again.
Relaxing the trading laws benefited both Spanish America and Spain, but Panama's economic decline was serious. Transit trade had for so long furnished the profits on which Panama had flourished that there had been no incentive to develop any other economic base. After the suppression of its "audiencia" in 1751, Panama became a quiet backwater, a geographically isolated appendage of New Granada, scarcely self-supporting even in food and producing little for export.
In 1793, near the close of the colonial period, the first recorded attempt at a comprehensive census of the area that had comprised the Panamanian "audiencia" was made. Incomplete and doubtless omitting most of the Indian and "cimarrón" population, specifically excluding soldiers and priests, the census recorded 71,888 inhabitants, 7,857 of whom lived in Panama City. Other principal towns had populations ranging from 2,000 to a little over 5,000.
Social hierarchy in the colony was rigid. The most prestigious and rewarding positions were reserved for the "peninsulares ", those actually born in Spain. "Criollos", those of Spanish ancestry but born in the colonies, occupied secondary posts in government and trade. Mestizos, usually offspring of Hispanic fathers and Indian mothers, engaged in farming, retail trade, and the provision of services. African and Indian slaves constituted an underclass. To the extent possible, Indians who escaped enslavement avoided Hispanic society altogether.
The church held a special place in society. Priests accompanied every expedition and were always counselors to the temporal leaders. The first bishop on the mainland came with Pedrarias. The bishop's authority, received from the king, made him in effect a vice governor. The bishopric was moved from Darién to Panama City in 1521. The relationship between church and government in the colony was closer than in Spain. Both the Roman Catholic Church and the monastic orders gained great wealth through tithes and land acquisition.
Independence from Spain.
Lacking communication except by sea, which the Spanish generally controlled, Panama remained aloof from the early efforts of the Spanish colonies to separate from Spain. Revolutionaries of other colonies, however, did not hesitate to use Panama's strategic potential as a pawn in revolutionary maneuvers. General Francisco de Miranda of Venezuela, who had been attracting support for revolutionary activities as early as 1797, offered a canal concession to Britain in return for aid. Thomas Jefferson, while minister to France, also showed interest in a canal, but the isolationist policies of the new United States and the absorption of energies and capital in continental expansion prevented serious consideration.
Patriots from Cartagena attempted to take Portobelo in 1814 and again in 1819, and a naval effort from liberated Chile succeeded in capturing the island of Taboga in the Bay of Panama. Panama's first act of separation from Spain came without violence. When Simón Bolívar's victory at Boyacá on August 7, 1819, clinched the liberation of New Granada, the Spanish viceroy fled Colombia for Panama, where he ruled harshly until his death in 1821. His replacement in Panama, a liberal constitutionalist, permitted a free press and the formation of patriotic associations. Raising troops locally, he soon sailed for Ecuador, leaving a native Panamanian, Colonel José de Fábrega, as acting governor.
Panama City immediately initiated plans to declare independence, but the city of Los Santos preempted the move by proclaiming freedom from Spain on November 10, 1821. This act precipitated a meeting in Panama City on November 28, which is celebrated as the official date of independence.

March Upcountry

March Upcountry is the first novel in the science fiction series of the Empire of Man by David Weber and John Ringo. It tells the story of Prince Roger MacClintock and his bodyguards of the Empress' Own Regiment who get marooned on the alien planet of Marduk due to an act of sabotage on their ship, and must fight their way towards the local space port (held by enemies of the Terran Empire) in order to get back home to Earth. The book appeared on the "New York Times" best seller list.
Characters.
Prince Roger MacClintock is the youngest and least loved child of Empress Alexandra VII, ruler of the Empire of Man from her second consort, Lazar Fillipo, the Earl of New Madrid. An extremely handsome and tall 22-year-old man who loves dressing up in extremely fine and expensive clothing, Roger is considered, by most, as a fop and is not well regarded by pretty much anyone except his valet, Kostas Matsugae. Aware at times of his childish behavior and in desperate need of love and genuine parental guidance (and at times, parental discipline), Roger manages to learn several important lessons about life, his responsibilities as a member of the royal family, his behavior towards those who are beneath him socially, and the circumstances of his birth which are the cause for his strained relationship with his mother. He is an experienced game hunter who's used to hunting game that can "hunt back". This experience serves him well throughout the March, as his superlative marksmanship and his high-priced but antiquated chemically-propelled hunting rifle (dubbed a "smoke-pole" by the marines) saves the expedition countless times (though it also gets him in trouble at least once).
Captain Armand Pahner is the commander of Bravo Company, Bronze Battalion of the Empress's Own Regiment, the elite bodyguards charged with protecting the royal family at all costs. A 50-plus year veteran of the Imperial Marines, Pahner is an extremely capable, competent and professionally paranoid individual who possesses a degree of personal calm that is almost frightening and who rarely loses his temper (though Roger's shenanigans manage to unnerve him several times throughout the story). He is a former smoker who now chews gum on a regular, almost ritualized, basis (as seen in the way he unwraps the sticks of gum). While initially disdainful of Roger and constantly at odds with his childish behavior, he does manage to see in Roger the potential of becoming a decent junior commander on the expedition and Roger eventually comes to view him as a surrogate father figure that had been missing in his life.
D'nall Cord is a native of the planet Marduk whose life is saved accidentally by Roger. Cord is a Shaman in his tribe, the X'Intai, the very first society Roger and his marines encounter on Marduk. By saving his life, Cord becomes indebted to Roger for all eternity (known as the bond of "asi") and is forced to forswear all relationship with his tribe (as if he died) and follow Roger around for the rest of his life. He was mated only once in his past but his mate died in childbirth. As such, he sees his nephews as substitutes to the children he never had. Having studied in his youth in the fabled city of Voitan, Cord is something of a warrior monk and philosopher who trains Roger in the use of the sword, teaches him the meaning of duty as a "chieftain" to his "tribe" and manages to whack some sense into the young prince's head (once quite literally with a blunt object). He serves as the company's guide throughout the story in region where they land.
D'nall Denat is one of Cord's nephews. A hunter in his tribe who's experienced in hunting by night, Denat joins the March out of curiosity and his liking of playing card games with Poertena. The March brings out of Denat an amazing talent for languages and a natural flair for intelligence gathering, particularly when he plays the role of a "dumb barbarian", listening in on conversations others believe he can't understand.
Eleonora O'Casey is Roger's chief of staff and former tutor. Holding multiple doctorates in sociology, political sciences and human history, O'Casey manages to help the company in their interactions with the locals, serving as both interpreter and political adviser. However, her main area of expertise is Imperial politics and she has a great deal of knowledge in the inner workings and Byzantine plots in the Royal Court (including the reasons for the repudiation of Roger's father, from the Court). She is a city girl who is unused to the horrifying conditions of Marduk, and spends much of March in complete agony (though she eventually adapts).
Kostas Matsugae is Roger's valet and manservant who becomes the company's caravan chief. Kostas is mousey and fussy as he likes to provide Roger with all creature comforts possible (such as fine clothes and good food), even on Marduk. He's also a kind and charitable soul who essentially believes that really terrible things don't happen "in this day and age". While merely a civilian, Kostas is a trusted imperial servator and the only person, prior to hitting Marduk, who is close to Roger.
Eva Kosutic is the senior NCO in Bravo Company and an extremely competent and experienced combat veteran. A native of the planet Armagh, Kosutic is a Satanist priestess, with a wry sense of humor and a matter-of-fact attitude. She constantly presses the troops to maintain their discipline, professionalism and paranoia as members of the elite Empress's Own and she knows more about the troops and Captain Pahner than anyone (including Pahner himself).
Julio Poertena is the armorer for Bravo Company. A native of the planet Pinopa and from a non-English speaking household, Poertena speaks with a heavy accent, enjoys swearing a lot and is something of a joker. He is also an Olympic class swimmer (his home world being mostly made up of archipelagos) and an avid gambler who carries a deck of cards with him everywhere he goes and he introduces the Mardukans to card games (and managing to swindle those who play against him). His professional approach to dealing with recalcitrant weapons and armor is to beat them with a meter-long Stilson adjustable wrench (dubbed his "pick pocking wrench") until it shapes up or ships out. He carries around a huge rucksack that contains everything a first-class armory would need (though not a kitchen sink - the marines asked).
Adib Julian is one of the senior NCOs in the company and the former company armorer. Dubbed "the laughing warrior" by Cord, Julian tends to become humorous in the face of danger and joke around a lot, particularly at the expense of his strait-laced Asgardian best friend Gronningen. His opinion of Roger is not particularly high initially, though it changes as the story progresses.
Nimashet Despreaux is a squad commander in Bravo company. She is beautiful and vulnerable yet also tough and very dangerous. She manages to draw Prince Roger's interest to her as a woman despite all the Prince's formidible self-control where women are concerned, an interest that appears mutual from the very beginning and causes her to be much more sympathetic towards the Prince.
Warrant Officer Mike "Doc" Dobresceau is one of the shuttle pilots who land the company on Marduk. He became a pilot after serving as a Raider medic, trained to perform surgery in the field on combat injuries. His inclusion on the March turns out to be extremely fortuitous, since none of the doctors from the "DeGlopper" could come along.
Mark & John St. John are identical twins who serve in Bravo Company, with John being the hard-working, smart and capable NCO and Mark being the fighter. While the two maintain a low-level sibling argument throughout the March over every possible topic - from pranks in bygone days to who their mother loves more - they cover each other's backs at all times. Their first sergeant had ordered them to have a distinguishable mark on their bodies at all times (because he couldn't tell them apart) and as such Mark always shaves the left side of his head.
Empress Alexandra VII is the ruler of the Empire of Man and Roger's mother. Their relationship is strained due to Roger's similarity in appearance and behavior to his hated father and because Alexandra has been forced to spend most her time away from him, dealing with the many internal crises that are destabilizing the empire (though she spent much more time with him as a baby). After discovering New Madrid's connections to the Adoula Cabal and consequently expelling him from court, Alexandra considered terminating her pregnancy with Roger (who'd been in a uterine replicator at the time) but eventually decided against it. While highly intelligent and competent, she admits she's not good at dealing with the "personal stuff" in her life.
Xiya Kan is king of the city-state Q'Nkok, the first city the Marines visit on Marduk. King Xyia is a moderate ruler who is forced to contend with an endless number of plots directed against him and the independent merchants of the city by the various great houses of the city; he longs to rid himself of them permanently. Though a member of a technologically primitive race, he is by no means unsophisticated or foolish and knows that direct action is not always the best choice. He happily collaborates with the Marines to expose a plot directed at Cord's people (and threatens war between Q'Nkok and the X'Intai) and later on assists the marines with funds and support that are crucial for their journey.
T'Leen Targ is a Voitanese veteran of the Kranolta wars and a weapons dealer in Q'Nkok who sells a Katana-like sword to Kosutic for Prince Roger. Though a giant even by Mardukan standards and a warrior in his past, his fighting days are long since over after losing his left true-arm at the elbow and sustaining numerous other wounds. Both his horns are capped with "wickedly sharp" bronze points, and a hook has replaced his left true-arm. After seeing the marines in action in Q'Nkok and hearing that they plan to travel through Kranolta territory, he contacts his fellow Voitan and T'an K'tass survivors, seeing an opportunity to reclaim Voitan once more.
Radj Hoomas is king of the city-state of Marshad. An extremely ambitious and devious individual, he seeks to use the Marines in his quest to conquer the Hadur region and unify it under his rule. To that end, he attempts to poison Prince Roger and his commanders, not realizing how alien they truly are. As a result of past actions of his father, Radj Hoomas is the sole land owner and has used his position to accumulate more and more power and treasure at the expense of others, including his own subjects (who live in crushing poverty).
Kheder Bijan is the head of the Marshad secret police and a self-proclaimed "tinker". While crafty and outwardly loyal to Raj Hoomas, he joins with the marines to topple the king to install himself as monarch. In turn, he tries to renege on his promises to allow the marines out of the city fully supplied and use them as Raj Hoomas wanted to use them (to conquer the region).
T'Leen Sena is a female "intelligence operative" of sorts in Marshad. Raised in the Voitan ways - where females had much greater standing than in Marshad (or elsewhere for that matter) - she is very independent, strong-willed and capable. She is trained in the "enat" fighting techniques which make a fairly dangerous individual as well, but is equally capable at remaining unabtrusive and docile-looking which permits her to blend into the background.
Dogzard is a pet Roger picks up at Cord's village. Once the runt of the litter, she grows enormously during the March and follows Roger around slavishly, constantly looking either for food or a fight (or usually both).
Patty is one of the "flar-ta" pack animals the company employs. While similar to the wild "flar-ke" beasts the "flar-ta" are much more docile, though Patty seems to have some "flar-ke" DNA in her (as seen in her tendency to fight mean and not run away from a fight). Roger develops an unusual rapport with the beast that allows him to use her as a war steed, plowing his way through enemies and letting her do most of the work. It is Roger who gives her this human name since she reminds him of a "Patricia" he once knew in boarding school.
Plot summary.
Prince Roger Ramius Sergei Alexander Chiang MacClintock is summoned before his mother, the Empress of Man, and his older half-brother Prince John, the heir-apparent, and is ordered to attend a flag-showing ceremony on the planet Leviathan, one of the Empire's more distant and backward member-worlds. Roger protests, but eventually accepts the assignment and stalks out of the room. Roger boards the assault transport "Charles DeGlopper" with Eleanora O'Casey and Kostas Matsugae where they are greeted by its skipper, Captain Vil Krasnitsky, who welcomes them aboard graciously but is put off by Roger's apathy, requiring O'Casey to repeatedly apologize and excuse Roger's juvenile behavior throughout the voyage.
Shortly after the ship enters "Tunnel Space", Sergeant-Major Eva Kosutic goes out to check the status of the troops guarding the prince and discovers a sentry shot dead just outside engineering. She alerts Pahner to the security breach and proceeds to hunt down the suspected saboteur. She discovers that the saboteur has planted shaped charges on the ship's main plasma conduits. Pahner orders Captain Krasnitsky to shut down the conduits but Krasnitsky says that shutting down now could destroy the ship. Kosutic catches up with the saboteur who turns out to be the ship's logistics officer, Ensign Guha, and manages to shoot her in the neck and run for the exit just before the dead man's switch detonates the charges.
Roger, who was forced into a spacesuit and then sat on by two marines (for his own safety), is eventually released and briefed on the attack. Ensign Guha had apparently been a toot-zombie and aside from planting explosives, she also planted computer viruses that crippled every major system. Pahner says their only option is to effect repairs and head for the nearest habitable star system which happens to be Marduk. Though the planet is nominally an Imperial world, it has only minimal landing facilities that are insufficient to repair the damage to "DeGlopper". Also, the region is notorious for drug smuggling, piracy and "Saint" activity, all of which raises the risk to the "DeGlopper" and the prince.
Upon entry into Marduk's star system, the "DeGlopper" detects the presence of an unidentified warship already in the system, indicating that Marduk is under hostile control. Being too deep inside the system's tunnel wall the "DeGlopper" is left no choice but to fight. Additionally, the enemy cruiser is not equipped with a tunnel drive which means it must have been dropped off by a carrier, which is "much" more heavily armed and which might still be in-system. The senior officers of the "DeGlopper" therefore plan for the impending attack against the enemy cruiser and Bronze Battalion is tasked with taking the space port on the planet. However, they soon detect a second ship and both are assumed to be Saint cruisers. The "DeGlopper", so heavily damaged, has no chance of destroying both ships, and with a member of the royal family aboard, surrender is not an option. The battle plan, therefore, changes: The "DeGlopper" will engage the cruisers and attempt to destroy both by any means, while the shuttles carrying Prince Roger and his body guards will have to be launched from a much greater distance, then land on the far side of the planet and make their way "on foot" and then over sea to the space port, capture it and then capture a tunnel-drive starship.
O'Casey briefs the company commanders and Roger on what to expect on Marduk though the information she has is very limited. Marduk is an incredibly hot and humid world with unfriendly wildlife and inhabitants. The Mardukans are at a pre-steam level of technology and some of the more advanced cultures have discovered gunpowder and are organized in city-states, small empires or in a state of barbarism. Pahner points out that they can eat the local foods but that they'll still need to carry dietary supplements for materials that simply don't exist in Mardukan biochemistry. He adds that crossing the planet on foot will take months.
After loading the shuttles to capacity with all the necessary materials and fuel, the company awaits the battle in the shuttles. "DeGlopper" engages the first Saint cruiser and wins but, as expected, sustains heavy damage. The shuttles are launched and "DeGlopper" heads towards the second Saint cruiser. After engaging the second ship, "DeGlopper" is crippled and the Saint cruiser closes with it in order to board her. Eleonora O'Casey suddenly realizes that she forgot something extremely important on board - her copy of Encyclopedia Galactica. She requests a link to the ship to download the information knowing that the Saint could pick up the transmission. The Saint ship does detect the transmission but not soon enough, as "DeGlopper" self-destructs, taking the Saint cruiser with it. Aboard the shuttles, O'Casey gloomily reports that she only got a fraction of the data she needed. Kosutic however, isn't worried; the marines come from so many worlds with so many diverse backgrounds that they'll probably find someone there who knows something about primitive technologies such as those used by the Mardukans.
As they approach the planet, the sensors pickup the presence of the Saint carrier that probably brought the cruisers into the system. Though undetected, the shuttles are forced to alter course and land even farther from the port than planned, with very little fuel for such a course correction. In the end they settle on what looks like salt-flats and barely manage a "dead stick" landing. After unloading their equipment, Bravo Company sets out in the sweltering heat on their long journey.
After six hours on the salt flats, Bravo Company reaches the jungle and Roger notices strop marks on some of the trees indicating the territorial markings of a very large animal. The animal in question is soon spotted by the company - an elephant sized beast with horns and an armor ruff protecting its neck with a closer examination revealing a herbivore. Pahner orders everyone to check fire but Roger does not hear the command and guns it down. Pahner is furious and privately chastises Roger, without giving him a chance to explain his reasons for shooting the beast. Minutes later, a Mardukan native suddenly emerges from the treeline. After O'Casey works out a translation "kernel" she manages to figure out the native's purpose. He is D'Nall Cord, a shaman of the X'Intai people and he asks who killed the "flar" beast. When told it is Roger, he tells him that they are brothers for life. When Roger tries to decline the honor Cord says he isn't all that happy about the situation either but that the laws of people demand it. Pahner is also unhappy about the situation, but thinks it might have some advantages, such as Cord being able to introduce them peacefully to his tribe and his knowledge of the area.
As the company follows Cord to his village he urges them to hurry before nightfall as the "yaden" come out then. When asked what the "yaden" are, his response actually translates as "vampire". While inclined to dismiss this as superstition, Cord's description of the "yaden" is too specific for Roger and Pahner's peace of mind. When night comes and the company is forced to make camp in the "Valley of the Vampires", Pahner sets up the tightest perimeter he can. Sadly, this proves inadequate as one of the troops is found dead in the middle of the night with double-puncture marks over his body and drained of all his blood. The following day, another soldier is attacked by an arboreal worm-like creature that literally melts her to death. Cord identifies the creature as a "yaden-cuol" (christened a killer-pillar) and tells them to start paying more attention to the jungle if they wish to survive.
The company finally arrives at Cord's village, where they are greeted by the tribal chief D'net Delkra, Cord's brother. Cord tells his brother of his "asi" bond with Roger and Delkra, while saddened at this news, orders the binding ceremony conducted and a feast to be held for Roger and his "clan". While in the village, Cord and Delkra consult with Roger, Pahner and O'Casey on a serious problem facing the tribe from the neighboring city-state of Q'Nkok. The city and the X'Intai have a treaty whereby the city dwellers are permitted to cut only certain trees in a specific area of the tribe's territory in return for certain goods like iron spearheads. In recent months the woodcutters have been cutting deeper into the jungle than permitted while the goods being paid in return have been of poor quality. As a result, Cord's nephew and protégé Deltan died when his spearhead shattered while attacked by an animal. To attack the woodcutters would mean war with the city while allowing further violations would condemn the tribe to a slow death by starvation as the jungle is depleted of trees and game. The tribe could launch a surprise attack on Q'Nkok and feast on their food stores, but such an attack would leave them seriously weakened and their rival tribes would destroy them. Pahner asks that they delay attacking Q'Nkok until after the company has gone there so that they can resupply and assess the situation there.
Accompanied by Cord and several of his nephews, the company proceeds to Q'Nkok, where the tribesmen are not greeted well by the city dwellers (though a demonstration of the plasma rifle manages to stop the situation from devolving). They are brought before the King Xiya Kan and state their need for supplies in exchange for hi-tech tools while Cord notifies the king of Deltan's death and the continued treaty violations. The company arranges to eavesdrop on the king's council and hear him attack them for their continued misconduct. Believing that the king isn't involved in the plot, the company bugs all the great houses to discover who is. Meanwhile, the company roams the city and Kosutic stops by an arms merchant called T'Leen Targ and purchases a sword for the prince and hears from him the story of the destruction of Voitan and its sister cities by the barbarian Kranolta tribes. She tells this story to the company and points out that they need to cross their territory to get to the seacoast.
After listening in on the great houses, the marines discover that three of the great houses are conspiring to topple the king by provoking Cord's tribe into attacking the city, so as to weaken the king's guard. Then a group of Kranolta mercenaries they have employed will be brought into the city to finish off the guard and sack the competing great houses and independent merchants. The king is astounded and infuriated by this, but is skeptical and asks how they discovered this. The marines are forced to tell him about there technological surveillance abilities which deeply impress the king. Pahner and O'Casey offer Bravo Company's services in breaking this conspiracy in return for a portion of the fines and seizures as funding for their mission. Roger however, points out that the plotters didn't invent the woodcutting crisis, but merely capitalized upon it and offers a possible solution: mining coal in the valley on the other side of the X'Intai territory. The king knows of the valley but fears that no one will want to go there because of the "yaden". Roger then, "very" coldly, suggests that he send the plotters there. While the king is impressed by the elegance of the suggestion, Pahner is appalled and privately chastises him, telling him that he can't always go for a "bigger hammer".
The marines and the king's guards assault the Great Houses' homes, while Roger, Pahner and several marines, take out the nobles' guards at a state dinner, allowing the king's guards to arrest them. The king then introduces the marines to D'Len Pah, the leader of a tribe of professional caravan drivers who own several pack animals called "flar-ta". D'Len is impressed by the humans capabilities and agrees to join them, believing that they have the best chance of reopening the trade routs to Voitan. With their equipment and supplies loaded onto the pack beasts, Roger, Cord, his nephews Denat, Tratan and Cranla and the marines set forth into Kranolta territory.
Marduk continues to take its toll on the company and its equipment as they journey towards Voitan. Sergeant Cobedra is mauled to death by a large six-legged creature called an "atul" (damnbeast). Julian's better-than-average hearing saves him from getting killed by group of "yaden" (vampire-moths). Bands of Kranolta hunters ambush the company repeatedly, and a malfunction in one of the plasma rifles – a result of poor quality control of its power pack and the damaging effect of Marduk's climate on the safety mechanisms - blows up an entire squad in a small nuclear explosion. After jury-rigging a tester and scanning all the power packs they find many are defective and Pahner orders all but a couple of the packs discarded and that all the plasma rifles be sealed in bags and not used (seriously reducing the company's firepower). They are forced to travel two days through an enormous swamp, face the enormous "atul-grak" (bigbeast) and cross a river infested in Mardukan crocodiles (damncrocs). The experience causes Roger to start growing up and to get to know his troops better and appreciate the sacrifices they are willing make for him.
Meanwhile, the Kranolta assemble all of their tribes and decide to attack the human invaders. Their vanguard strikes the company just short of the ruins of Voitan and the company is forced to abandon several people trying to get to walls of the city. When they get there however, Pahner notices that Roger is missing and nearly explodes when he discovers that he lagged behind trying to help evacuate an injured marine. Roger soon finds himself facing several dozen Kranolta in one-on-one ritual combat and manages to kill every opponent. Pahner in the meantime orders the powered armor to be used to extract Roger, only to find that all but four of the suits aren't operational. When the armored marines do arrive, Roger calls out to the leader demanding safe passage in to the city and orders a demonstration of the plasma cannon. The leader consents but promises to return to finish them off.
When Roger arrives in the city, Pahner explodes on him, telling him that he must survive at all costs, even if that means that none of the marines survive, because his family is the only thing holding the empire together these days and that he needs to understand his place in the company. Pahner also tells him that he takes no joy in abandoning his people to die but that he must do this if it means succeeding in the mission to protect him. Roger finally realizes that the fault lays with him and that Pahner is right. Pahner then asks Roger to take command of Third Platoon (filling in for its dead CO) and to familiarize himself with the defenses they are preparing for the expected attack.
Come dawn the next day, the Kranolta approach the Citadel that the humans' have dug-in to in numbers far exceeding Pahner's estimate (18,000 instead of 5,000). The battle is fierce and lasts hours, with the Kranolta attempting to scale the walls and break open the gate, regardless of their casualties, while the marines and Roger rain plasma cannon fire, grenades and bead volleys at them. During the battle Roger and Cord are lightly wounded while the marines suffer serious casualties. Despite their incredible losses, the Kranolta are undeterred and continue to assault the Citadel. Suddenly, a new force emerges from the jungle and marines fear they are reinforcements for the Kranolta. However, the new forces raise the banners of fallen Voitan and of T'an K'tass and assault the Kranolta's remaining forces from the rear and pin them between them and the marines, leaving very few survivors. Pahner then negotiates a ceasefire, to allow the Kranolta to bury their dead and the marines to depart Voitan unmolested.
The company stays in Voitan for three weeks to allow it to recover. O'Casey busies herself with assisting T'Kal Vlan, the last ruler of T'an K'tass, and T'Leen Targ whom the company met earlier at Q'Nkok, while Dobrescu makes a few discoveries. He tells the Voitanese that the secret of their famous "water steel" (Damascene steel) is a combination of the unique ore composition found in mines there and the techniques they used and predicts that they should be able to produce the best weapons-grade steel they have yet. He also discovers that the Mardukans' genders are reversed; the males are actually ovipositors while the females produce the sperm and carry the fetuses. However, it is merely a technical definition (which explains the problems with the translators) and Pahner decides that the marines should continue to refer to the "females" as males. The Marines also use the time to bury their dead in the city's catacombs (a sign of high honor from the Voitanese), to collect good weapons and train with them.
The reduced company departs from Voitan and continues to march until they reach the Hadur region to a city called Marshad. They are soon intercepted by a tinker of some sort who also urges them to go to Marshad and acts as a sort of guide for the area. They arrive at the king's palace just in time to see him behead a hapless peasant and the Company is ordered to dress ranks to deter any idea of attack. Prince Roger addresses the king, presents his credentials and declares that Voitan has been restored. The king states that he has heard of their exploits, that a place has been prepared for them and that a feast shall be held in their honor. Though the locals seem friendly enough, Pahner, Roger, Kosutic, O'Casey and Cord all agree that King Radj is not to be trusted and need to consider the possibility that Radj will attempt to assassinate Roger or some of the marines.
At the lavish dinner, the humans eat very little due to the presence of a foul-tasting herb. O'Casey keeps herself busy by conversing with Jedal Vel, the Pasulian envoy. Afterwards, the king asks Roger if his puissant warriors could kill all of his guards in the room. Roger says that they probably could and the king glances at his guard captain, who promptly kills the Pasulian envoy sitting next to O'Casey. Roger remains unfazed by this, and with his usual speed pulls out a bead pistol and shoots the guard in question dead and immediately trains the weapon on the king himself. The king however never intended to kill them but to "motivate" them to do his bidding, which is to conquer Pasule for him. The humans at the dinner are then separated from the rest of their party.
As the rest of the company settles in for the duration, Poertena and Cord's nephews continue their card games. However, a Mardukan female in the room hums a song that is actually a message regarding the prince and a way to save him. Poertena realizes that this is an intelligence contact and discreetly transfers the request for a meet to his commanders. Lt. Jasco, Kosutic, Julian, Poertena and Denat meet in the kitchen as requested and are soon startled when a wall behind the lieutenant opens up to reveal the female and Kheder Bijan. Kheder tells the humans that had they failed to follow him to Marshad, King Radj would have sent his entire army to destroy them since they are his ticket to control of the Hadur region and that he will use them until they are all dead. Kosutic asks what the plan is and Kheder says that there are factions in Marshad in league with Pasule, who desire a change in regime in Marshad. All the marines need to do is to turn upon the army of Marshad with their "lightning weapons" on the day of the battle. The female, Sena, is to be their conduit to Kheder. The troops consider the plan and decide to go along with it with some changes that anger Kheder but which he has no choice but to agree to.
Denat is then sent out with Sena with a bomb that he is tasked to attach to the bridge the night before the attack. They arrive at her house, where Denat is introduced to her family. He explains his mission to them and they help with the details of the plan. They are then resolved to wait until the attack and share what little food they have with their guest, her father stating that "the House of T'Leen is not so fallen as to be unable to provide hospitality!". Upon hearing his name, Denat mentions that he knows a T'Leen Targ and Sena's father says he is his cousin T'Leen Sul. Happy to impart good news, Denat tells him about Targ and his role in recapturing Voitan and how the city is restored. Sul is overjoyed to hear this and resolves to return to Voitan with his wife.
As Pahner, Roger and O'Casey finish their plans and turn in for the night, a casual remark by O'Casey about his father draws Roger's attention. He is surprised to hear that O'Casey is fully briefed on the story and he surprises her in turn, by saying he was never told the reasons for his father's expulsion from Court. O'Casey then tells him the story, how his Grandfather was an ineffectual emperor whose policies had weakened the empire's military and destabilized it politically, how his mother had fallen in love with the Earl of New Madrid and how she discovered his connections to certain treasonous factions and had him repudiated and how she chose not to abort Roger. Roger realizes that his strained relationship with his mother is the result of his similarity, both in appearance and behavior to his hated father and that no one told him this story, because they assumed that he already knew. Worse, they assumed that his behavior was a sign that he was siding with his father and not his mother. Roger is infuriated by his mother's distrust, and orders O'Casey and the marines out of the room, which he then proceeds to demolish with his sword. O'Casey then turns to Pahner to explain what happen and that they need to talk, while the marines fear that Roger has become treasonous.
Roger finally emerges from his funk the next day to ask about the status of the company. He points out to Pahner that given their losses in life and ammunition to date, they are likely to run out of both before reaching the coast and suggests taking on Mardukan guards be it by loyalty oaths or cash. Pahner is forced to agree but is uncomfortable with the idea of hiring mercenaries. Meanwhile, Denat slips out of the city unnoticed and heads to the river, where he places the bomb under the bridge. Radj's new guard captain meets with Roger and demands that he draft orders to his troops to follow the guard captain's commands until they are reunited. After the exchange of threats, Roger complies.
On the morning of the battle, Roger speaks over the radio to the marines, explaining why he'd been so angry at his mother and the reasons that they found themselves on Marduk, stating that he still loves her both as a mother and as an empress and pledging to get all of them back home to Earth and to discuss the matter with his mother. The marines, encouraged by this, set off to the battle field while Roger, Pahner and the rest of the guards are ordered to join Radj in viewing the battle from the palace balcony. As arranged, the plasma cannon team carries the weapon into range and fires it at the Pasulian guards on the other side, who jump at first sight of the weapon. Once the bridge is clear, the rest of the marines and the Marshadan army cross to the Pasulian side and begin the assault on the city while the plasma cannon is hauled to the top of a hill (followed by a group of soldiers Radj has sent to keep an eye on them). Soon after, the smaller Pasulian army is spotted coming out of the city. Just as the two forces are about to meet, the marines spring their trap. The plasma cannon is turned upon the Marshadan army while the forces guarding the marines manning the cannon are blown apart by directional mines and the bridge explodes, cutting off their line of retreat. Pahner takes the king down while Roger and his bodyguards quickly dispatch with the king's guards and use their bodies to block the door until their reinforcements in the barracks get there.
Three days after the battle, Roger meets with Kheder Bijan, who is the new king of Marshad and inquires as to the delay in giving them the supplies and shields that were promised. Kheder refuses to give them what he promised and confidently tells Roger that he and his marines aren't going anywhere and threatens to withhold the antidote to the poison they consumed on their first night there if Roger fails to show him respect. Roger however, tells Kheder that he and the marines aren't from anywhere on his planet and therefore not vulnerable to the same poisons Mardukans are. When Kheder attempts to "renegotiate", Roger shoots him and orders T'Leen Sul to be brought in to replace him. With O'Casey's assistance T'Leen establishes a more rational regime, rearranging Marshad's resources and redistributing the land and dedicating more of it to food production rather than "dianda". Soon after, numerous diplomatic delegations from the surrounding city-states arrive at Marshad to meet with the humans both to thank them for removing Radj Hoomas and to promise safe passage through their territory. As Roger conducts the various diplomatic handshakes, Pahner notes to O'Casey in private how much he's grown and thinks to himself that Bravo Company's loyalties are to the no-longer useless Prince. As the marines organize for departure, Kosutic notifies Roger and Pahner that they've picked up a fragment of a radio transmission: someone has spotted the shuttles. Pahner decides that Roger and O'Casey may have been right about telling their friends along the way the truth so as to cover their back trail. Roger then mounts the "flar-ta" Patty with a recovering Cord at his back and gives to order to continue the march towards the mountains.
Locations on Marduk Visited by the Marines.
Q'Nkok - The first city-state that Roger and Bravo Company visit along the March. Like most Mardukan cities and villages it is located on a hill top to avoid flash floods. The city is ruled by King Xiya Kan and a council composed of the heads of all the great houses. While king is charged with protecting the city and ruling it the council is rife with intrigue and political backstabbing and a serious thorn in the king's side.
Voitan - Once the shining commercial and industrial center of the Hurtan region, known for its superior metal works and Damascene Steel, the city of Voitan found itself overwhelmed by the barbarian tribes of the Kranolta who had sacked the city and the surrounding city-states and occupied the region. However, the sacking of the city-states was not as complete as the Kranolta had thought as many of the cities artisans and workers along with their wealth had fled the city and established themselves elsewhere preparing for the day that they might retake the city. As a youth, D'Nal Cord was sent to study in Voitan.
Marshad - Radj Kordan, who had been king during the fall of Voitan, had found himself facing a rebellion among the great houses. After emerging victorious, he planned to strip them of their guards, fine them heavily and reduce their power, but was assassinated before he could do this. In retaliation, his son killed every member of the rebellious houses and absorbed his single remaining ally, thus leaving the House of Radj the only power in the city. Since then the city has fallen into ruin with crushing poverty everywhere except in the king's palace with all of the city's revenues from the lucrative trading "dianda" (a flax-like silk which is planted everywhere around the city at the expense of food) going towards defense (retaining lots of mercenaries) and lining the pockets of the king and his advisors while the peasants starve. The city's closest neighbor is the city-state Pasule which lives in constant fear of Marshad and its king.
Major Interstellar Players.
The Empire of Man - Also called the Terran Empire, it is one of the major interstellar powers in the area of the galaxy explored by humans. Ruled by a monarchy (house MacClintock) and a parliament consisting of an elected senate and a house of lords, the empire encompasses a great many worlds with varying degrees of technological development. Recent political problems, beginning with the reign of Emperor Andrew (Roger's grandfather), have created a great deal of factionalism, unrest and inequality, particularly between the core worlds and the outer planets. The result is a brewing crisis that the Empress has been desperately attempting to prevent and which is the cause of the attack on Roger that strands him and his marines on Marduk.
The Caravazan Empire - The Terran Empire's traditional enemy. Following the ascent of Pierpaelo Cavaza - a devotee of the Church of Ryback (an organization dedicated to removing "humanocentric" damage from the universe) - to the throne shortly after the Dagger Years, the empire embraced the tenets of the church into law. The move had triggered a short civil war that Cavaza had won proving that he was just as ruthless as his ancestors. Now the empire is led by his followers, religious eco-freaks who seek to impose their belief on how nature should be handled. As part of this belief system, the Saints "reclaim" certain worlds by forcing humans to remove all human influence and pollution (including their own waste - which is why they basically starve the people sent to reclaim these worlds to death).
Raiden-Winterhowe - A revanchist empire that was once invaded and forced to defend itself and now continues to expand because it simply can't stop.
The Alphane Alliance - An alliance consisting of 12 worlds and populated by humans, Althari and Phaenurs. The Althari are a female-dominated, stoic warrior race that resemble 3 meter tall koala bears while the Phaenurs are a four-legged, lizard-like race of functional telepaths (among themselves) and empaths. The Althari, being descended from ground burrowing creatures prefer underground dwellings with clear fields of fire, making them more like subterranean bunkers than homes. In Althari society, males are definitely second-class citizens, untrusted by the females, many of whom consider them as being useful only for breeding and housework. Defined by O'Casey as "very shrewd bargainers" since they can't be lied to (the Phaenurs being able to sense deception). The Alliance is on friendly terms with the Empire of Man.
Technology.
Tutorial Implants ("Toots") - An implanted computer processor that interfaces completely with human neural systems without adverse side effects. Used primarily for data processing, storage and training, the toot augments a persons learning capability, including the use of assassination programs (for better marksmanship) or translating alien languages. The device can, in fact, take over for the person and allow him to perform tasks more efficiently. However, it is a security planner's nightmare, as the toot can be hacked and the person forced to do a task against their will (as if they'd been possessed by a demon). People whose toots have been hacked are called "toot zombies" or "toombies".
ChromSten - The hardest substance known to modern science, a form of collapsed matter, used both in ship's armor and in personal body armor. Only a plasma rifle (or something stronger) can penetrate ChromSten.
Tunnel Drive - The faster-than-light method of transport used for interstellar travel. Ships equipped with tunnel drives tend to be huge, as the drive takes up a lot of volume. Every star system, depending on the size of its primary star, has a limit within which entry into tunnel space is impossible (known as the Tsukayama Limit). Travel between star systems takes days and sometimes weeks.
Phase Drive - The drive used when the ship is in normal space.
Bead Rifles and Cannons - Projectile weapons that fire five-millimeter steel-coated, glass- or tungsten-cored beads "accelerated to phenomenal speeds" via electromagnetic lining in the weapon's barrel.
Plasma Rifles and Cannons - The main field energy weapon, capable of taking out powered armor. The plasma rifles utilize a magazine containing lithium-deuteride pellets and a power source to feed the laser compressors that initiate the fusion reaction that drives the weapon.
Chameleon Suits - The standard issue marine uniform that allows the wearer to fade into the background. The suits also offer limited ballistic protection and can be configured for work in vacuum environments.
Powered Armor - ChromSten made armor that offers even better ballistic protection and camouflage capabilities that chameleon suits and are susceptible to damage only from heavy energy weapons such as plasma rifles and cannons or the last-ditch, contact-range weapon called a "one-shot", which delivers a shock wave through the armor to the plasteel matrix supporting it, causing a scab to break free and ricochette inside the armor, killing the person inside.
Nanotechnology - Widely used throughout the story and in many ways. Prince Roger, his staff, the marines and the navy personnel attached all have nannites floating around in their blood stream whose function is to enhance the person's regenerative capabilities (even a lost limb, though this takes a metabolic toll on the body), process alien nutrients into something human anatomy can use, increase the body's endurance and protect against disease and foreign toxins. The marines also have nanotech recording devices used in an intelligence gathering function. These devices are the size of a small insect and can move like one so as to look innocuous.

Prussian G 8.2

The Prussian G 8.2 class of locomotives actually incorporated two different types of engine: One was the Prussian/Oldenburg G 8.2, for which the Deutsche Reichsbahn subsequently issued follow-on orders; the other was the G 8.2 of the Lübeck-Büchen Railway.
Prussian G 8.2.
The Prussian G 8.2 was a 2-cylinder version of the Prussian G 8.3. It had been established that the inside third engine of the G 8.3 was not absolutely necessary and discontinued the G 8.3 as a consequence. Like that engine the G 8.2 had been developed from the G 12 and was in essence a shorter version of it. The locomotives were employed on heavy goods train duties on main lines. Later the top speed on some units was raised to 75 km/h so that the G 8.2 could also be used to haul passenger trains. A totoal of 846 examples of the locomotive were built between 1919 and 1928 for the Prussian state railways and the Deutsche Reichsbahn. Five vehicles, that had been delivered in 1921 to the "Reichsbahndirektion" of Oldenburg, had been equipped with Lentz valve gear as was usual on the Oldenburg machines. The locomotives delivered in 1922 were "Cassel" division numbers; in 1923 several were supplied as DRG Class 31 before they were allocated their eventual DRG numbers in 1923. Another 150 vehicles were supplied to the Turkish and Rumanian railways. The firm of AEG converted four engines to coal-dust firing in 1930. 650 examples of these locos were still present in Germany after the Second World War. The Deutsche Reichsbahn had given them operating numbers 56 2001–2485 and 2551–2916.
In the Deutsche Bundesbahn this class was very quickly retired; the last one to go being no. 56 2637, withdrawn in 1963 and retired in 1965. The Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany used these locomotives right up to the early 1970s - a number even being given computer numbers. Its last stronghold was Bw Vacha in Thuringia, which had both the first and last engine to be built: nos. 56 2001 and 56 2916. In Germany no Class 56.20–29 has been preserved. No. 56 2795 is in the Warsaw railway museum as no. Tr6-39.
Link: Ehemalige 56 2795 in Warschau
G 8.2 of the LBE.
The G 8.2's with the Lübeck-Büchen Railway were certainly similar to the Prussian G 8.2's, but were in fact an independent design with numerous differences. For example, they were noticeably longer and did not appear quite as stocky. They were intended to take charge of heavy goods trains running between Hamburg and Lübeck. Because these locomotives were also to be used in passenger services, the running gear and brakes were designed so that the top speed could be raised to 75 km/h. A total of eight engines was delivered between 1923 and 1930 by Linke-Hofmann. In 1938 they were given Reichsbahn numbers 56 3001-3008.
The Deutsche Bundesbahn took over locomotives 56 3001 and 56 3003-3008 and retired them by 1951. No. 56 3002 was left to the Deutsche Reichsbahn (GDR) in the east, who retired her in 1956.
Locomotive 56 3007 has been preserved and is in the Darmstadt-Kranichstein Railway Museum.
The engines were equipped with tenders of classes pr 3 T 16.5, pr 3 T 20 or pr 2'2' T 21.5.

Jordi Pablo Ripollés

Jordi Pablo Ripollés (born 1 January 1990 in Vinaròs, Castellón) is a Spanish footballer who plays for La Roda CF as a right midfielder.
Club career.
Jordi Pablo began his career with Vinaròs CF, joining Villarreal CF's youth system at 16. He made his debuts for the first team in April 2009, appearing in two consecutive defeats: 0–2 at home against Málaga CF for La Liga and 0–3 at Arsenal in the season's UEFA Champions League – this was due to the injury of Santi Cazorla, lost for the campaign also in that month.
In late July 2009 Pablo joined Málaga on a four-year deal, with Villarreal retaining a rebuying option in the first three. Late into the club's preseason he suffered a severe knee injury against Levante UD, going on to miss the entire 2009–10.
On 17 August 2010, Pablo was loaned to FC Cartagena in the second division. However, in the Murcian club's first pre-season match, he injured his right leg, being sidelined for the first months of the new season, and again failing to appear officially.
On 1 August 2011, Málaga cancelled Jordi Pablo's contract. He immediately returned to Villarreal's reserves, in the second level; on 22 October 2011 he made his first appearance since 26 April 2009, playing the last 29 minutes against Real Murcia in a 1–3 away defeat.
International career.
Jordi Pablo played for Spain's U-17 at the 2007 World Cup held in South Korea, helping the nation to a final runner-up spot, after a penalty shootout loss to Nigeria. After his performances (three goals, four matches), he was "upgraded" to the under-19.

Chandranath Temple

Chandranath Temple (), located on top of the Chandranath hill, is a famous Shakti Peeth located near Sitakunda in Bangladesh where, as per Hindu sacred texts, the right arm of Goddess Sati fell. Sitakunda Chandranath Temple is a holy place of pilgrimage.
Historical references.
The Rajmala states that about 800 years ago, Raja Biswambhar Sur, a descendant of the famous Adisur of Gaur, tried to reach Chandranath by sea. The Nigamkalpataru refers to the poet Jayadev living for a time in Chandranath. By the time of Dhanya Manikya, ruler of Tripura, Chandranath received numerous endowments. Dhanya Manikya attempted to remove the idol of Shiva from the temple to his kingdom but failed.
Legend.
Sati, was the first wife of Shiva as the first incarnation of Parvati. She was the daughter of King Daksha and Queen (the daughter of Brahma). She committed self-immolation at the sacrificial fire of a yagna performed by her father Daksha as she felt seriously distraught by her father’s insult of her husband and also to her by not inviting both of them for the yagna. Shiva was so grieved after hearing of the death of his wife that he danced around the world in a Tandav Nritya (“devastating penance” or dance of destruction) carrying Sati's dead body over his shoulders. Perturbed by this situation and in order to bring Shiv to a state of normalcy, it was then Vishnu who decided to used his Sudarshan Chakra (the rotating knife s carried on his finger tip). He dismembered Sati’s body with the chakra into several pieces and wherever her body fell on the earth, the place was consecrated as a divine shrine oo Shakthi Peeth with deities of Sati (Parvati) and Shiva. These locations have become famous pilgrimage places as Pithas or Shakthi Pithas, and are found scattered all over the subcontinent including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal, apart from India. Sati is also known as Devi or Shakthi, and with blessinggs of Vishnu she was reborn as the daughter of Himavat or Himalayas and hence named as Parvati (daughter of mountains). She was born on the 14th day of the bright half of the month of Mrigashīrsha, which marks the Shivarathri (Shiva’s night) festival.
The Chandranath Temple as a Shakti Peeth.
The Chandranath Temple is considered as a Shakti Peetha, the revered shrines of Shaktism. "The mythology of Daksha yaga and Sati's self immolation" is the source mythology behind the origin of Shakti Peethas. Shakti Peethas are divine shrines of Shakti, due to the falling of body parts of the corpse of Sati Devi, when Lord Shiva carried it and wandered throughout Aryavartha in sorrow. There are 51 Shakti Peeth linking to the 51 alphabets in Sanskrit. Each temple have shrines for Shakti and Kalabhairava. The Right Arm of Sati Devi's corpse is believed to have fallen here. The Shakti is known by the name Bhavani.

FlickRocket

FlickRocket is a platform for film distribution for content owners, independent film makers and DVD distributors from ACE GmbH. The software components run exclusively on Microsoft Windows operating systems. The platform allows to publish full featured Video DVDs online, which can be downloaded, viewed on a computer, burned to a DVD-R and also be exported to a wide variety of mobile video players. As of that, customers are able to use the purchased or rented video on a large amount of software and hardware video players, including Windows Media Center. All video files and burned DVD-Rs are optionally protected against copyright violations by using fluxDVD and Protect Software technology.
Features.
All movies are transcoded into low bandwidth, high-quality H.264 video files, which usually have a size of around 1-2 GB per DVD. All menus, audio and subpicture streams from the source DVD are kept, LPCM streams are converted to AC3. Each resulting file contains a complete DVD which can be played on every Windows computer with an installed video and audio decoding filter package. The file can also contain additional metadata like textual descriptions of movie titles, actors, etc. and a graphical DVD cover and a thumbnail, as also auto-generated preview pictures. The thumbnail/cover can be displayed in video players or printed by the user.
The movie assets are uploaded to a server after defining licenses and pricing for the content. Movies can either be rented (for a given period of time) or purchased to own. Optionally it is possible to encrypt the movie with a DRM scheme, which will also add copy protection to the burned DVD-R. The movie can be assigned to different themes (like horror, comedy, etc.) and customer groups (e.g. for sending a preview of a movie to a limited audience). All settings can be changed at any time within a shop management website. 
The server checks the upload for any upload errors and distributes the movie to the FlickRocket Content Delivery Network, from where customers can download the movie after the purchase. The FlickRocket platform offers web shop templates which can be modified and integrated into other webpages by copying and pasting specifically created HTML code. Within the web shop various user languages are supported and the payment gateway includes support for credit cards and PayPal. The money from all movie sales is paid out monthly.
Tools.
Encoder Tool.
The FlickRocket Encoder is used by content owners in order to transcode a given DVD into the fluxDVD file format. The tool keeps all menus, audio tracks, subtitles and other movie features like anamorphic encoding. The video is transcoded into a full resolution H.264 high profile video stream, existing audio streams are either kept, or optionally transcoded into 2 channel Dolby Surround AC3 audio streams. If the source video is not a DVD (like an AVI file), it is necessary to create a DVD from it first. 
It is possible to let the tool encode the video in various quality levels, the resulting bitrate is increasing with quality. It is not possible to predict how large a fluxDVD file will get, as the video is always encoded in a constant quality level. Movies with a lot of noise or action will get larger than movies which contain many static scenes. The final file size depends, beside the other parameters, on the length of all titles on the given DVD. 
A first quick analyse run determines the bitrate distribution of the movie and whether the movie is interlaced. Due to the complexity of the H.264 high profile, the encoding process can take several hours to complete.
During the encoding process, preview pictures are automatically created from pictures of the movie at equidistant positions. 
Upload Tool.
After the conversion of the movie, the file can be uploaded by the FlickRocket Uploader. Before the actual upload takes place, it is possible to add various metadata to the file and to select which preview pictures should be used in the web shop. A user specified thumbnail and DVD cover can also be included in the resulting file. Further it is possible to add a DRM scheme to the fluxDVD file, which makes it impossible to use a downloaded file on computers without a valid license. Each user needs to obtain a license for such a movie which happens automatically as part of the purchase or rental process.
After the upload finishes, the server performs some checks on the uploaded file and sends it to the FlickRocket Content Delivery Network. From that time on, the movie is ready to be sold and the related web shop will be updated.
Website Management.
By using the Shop Management web page of the FlickRocket web shop it is possible to create and manage different license models (e.g. rental or purchase), choose or create a web and confirmation email template and to link movies to other movies, in order to create a recommendation group.
The Management web page also includes tools for the creation of discount codes, managing of email lists (using wildcards for customer names or discount codes) and the creation and management of user groups. User groups are helpful for subscription or screener distribution.
The server will then generate web shop integration HTML code, either as an external link to the customized FlickRocket web shop on the FlickRocket web server or as HTML for usage within an IFrame embedded in another web site.
Playback and Conversion Tools.
On the client side, there are different software tools which enable the user to view the fluxDVD file in nearly every media player and, depending on the license, to transcode the movie to a standards compliant DVD, which can be burned using regular DVD burners and media. The burned DVD plays on every standard DVD player. The DVDs optionally have a copy protection, which makes it hard to create a copy of the disc. 
In addition to burn, the license might contain rights for exporting the file to various optinally protected output formats like WMV, iPod, PlayStation Portable or 3GP for cell phones (with OMA).
In order to enhance the experience in the webshop, a download manager is integrated into the web shop and handles the download of the movie while it is watched or converted.

Format.
The format, unique to V8 Supercar and loosely similar to the Pukekohe 500 format, splits the 500 kilometres into two separate 250 kilometres races each held on a different day. Unlike the 1999 race the two races were no longer combined into a single timesheet. Points were still assigned separately to the races, and they combined to award a round result.
