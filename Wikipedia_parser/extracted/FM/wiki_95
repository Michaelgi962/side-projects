Oscar Nuccio

Oscar Nuccio (Brindisi, 9 July 1931 – Rieti, 23 April 2004) was an Italian historian of economic thought. He taught the history of economic thought in the departments of political science at the University of Pisa, the University of Teramo, and Sapienza University of Rome, always as an associate professor, as he was never awarded tenure.
He penned over 200 academic publications between 1957 and 2008, focusing his studies on the birth of Italian economic thought. A practicing Roman Catholic, he opposed Max Weber's thesis, arguing that the root of market capitalism is not to be found in the Protestant Reformation but in the reaction by lawyers and humanists to the framing of economic issues under scholasticism. This thesis is developed in particular in his 1999 work "Goodbye Protestant Ethics".
His most important work was "Italian Economic Thought", a three-volume, seven-book work which covered the eleventh to the eighteenth centuries and won the Saint-Vincent Prize for the Economy in 1985. The work was summarized in the 700 pages of "A History of Italian Economic Thought (As a Genesis of the Capitalist Spirit)", published posthumously in 2008 by the LUISS University Press (Rome) and also available in English. In 1987 the study "Economic Epistemology: the role of the concepts of 'nature' and 'natural law' in the genesis of the economic" won the "Seventy-fifth Prize" awarded by the "Review of Economic Policy". Nuccio followed that major work in 2000 with the study "False and Commonplace in History: the equation of the Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism", published by Alberti (Florence).
Nuccio also managed the anastatic reprinting of about thirty classics of the nineteenth century in the collection "Italian Classic Writers of Political Economy", or the "Custodi Collection" (in fifty volumes).

Nick Lassa

Nicholas Anthony Lassa, (July 11, 1898 – September 4, 1964) more popularly referred to as Long Time Sleep, was a professional American football player from the Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana. 
Biography.
Born on July 11, 1898, Lassa was Native American and a member of the Blackfoot tribe, however some sources have him listed as a Cherokee or a Flathead. He was given the name, Long Time Sleep, by his teammates because he was so hard to wake up in the morning.
Lassa attended and played college football at the Carlisle Indian School and Haskell Indian Nations University. Lassa eventually played in the National Football League in 1922 with the Oorang Indians. 
The Oorang Indians were an all-Native American football team based in La Rue, Ohio and formed by Walter Lingo in 1922 to help promote his Airedale kennel. The team was organized by Jim Thorpe, who served the team as a player-coach. When the team formed, Lassa was the first player to arrive in La Rue.
Aside from football, Lassa enjoyed wrestling. He would make up to $50.00 for wrestling matches throughout the area. In fact he is most remembered for wrestling a bear as part of a halftime show of one of the Indians' games. Lassa would usually win between 10-20 dollars per match and that money would allow the whole team to go out partying all night.
After the folded in 1923, Lassa stayed near LaRue, earning his living as a professional wrestler and strongman. He also stayed on working for Lingo and several of the other farmers in the area. He finally left the area in the early 1930s. He reportedly gave up drinking, raised a family, and became a respected member of his community. Lassa died on September 4, 1964.

Banteay Prey Nokor

The ancient temple complex of Banteay Prei Nokor is located to the Northwest of Kompong Cham, Cambodia.
History.
The temple complex of Banteay Prey Nokor is especially known by the temple of Wat Nokor located in Khum of Kompong Siem, at a distance of 1200 meters from the town of Kompong Cham. The monument was built out of sandstone and laterite, and dates from the last years of the reign of Jayavarman VII. It is composed of a central tower surrounded by four laterite wall-enclosures. The central tower of the temple of Vat Nokor is decorated with motifs characteristic of Bayon with Buddhist scenes on the pediments.
The temple complex is also believed to have been the headquarters of Jayavarman VII for a time, from where he extended his influence over nearby principalities.
The local people sometimes call the temple 'Wat Angkor' though a sign at the entrance of the temple now officially designates the name of the temple as Wat Nokor Bachey. The temple has a number of distinguishing characteristics other than the fact that it is the largest ancient temple complex in Kampong Cham Province. One of these characteristics alludes to the fact that it is built of black sandstone, which causes it to stand out from other temples of the period which are often built of brick or reddish sandstone. The temple has an inscription which is still open to visitors to see (and even touch) in the temple's central pavilion. The temple also boasts a 'Chartre' effect in which another more modern temple of a very different style has been built over and around the original Angkorian structure creating a blend of architectural styles. There are many legends surrounding the origin of the temple but the most popular one has Oedipal overtones. According to this legend, the temple was built by a king who accidentally killed his father and married his mother. As recounted in the Greek legend, this King was put out by his father after a seer told him that his son would kill him. The son, however, did not die and returned to his kingdom not knowing that his father was the King. After quareling on the road, the son killed the King and married his Queen who was his mother. Upon discovering his crime, this young man built Wat Nokor in penance for his crime.
Wat Nokor does not get the attention or maintenance that it deserves with its poorly maintained grounds and gardens. The temple has great potential as a tourist attraction but is not yet adequately developed. Some people feel that the often deserted ambience of the temple is one of its greatest attractions and distinguishes it from the over touristed atmosphere found in Siem Reap and other popular tourist locations. Nevertheless, the litter strewn walks around the temple do not do justice to this ancient jewel of Kampong Cham.
World Heritage Status.
This site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on September 1, 1992 in the Cultural category.

STV Fair Jeanne

Tall Ship Fair Jeanne is a Canadian sail training ship built and registered in Ottawa, Ontario. She is operated by the Ottawa-based youth charity, Bytown Brigantine Inc. "Fair Jeanne" is a 110 ft traditionally-rigged brigantine of composite construction, outfitted with a Detroit Diesel auxiliary propulsion system. "Fair Jeanne" sails mostly on the Great Lakes, particularly Lake Ontario, and is berthed in Kingston, Ontario during the summer months.
While "Fair Jeanne"'s summer port is Kingston, she was built by the Fuller family in the backyard of their Ottawa home. "Fair Jeanne" began life as the family's private yacht, cruising the world’s oceans for more than 10 years. Today, however, "Fair Jeanne" sails for a different cause and is leased to the not-for-profit youth charity Bytown Brigantine, which uses her and her sister ship STV Black Jack for youth sail training. In addition to summer youth voyages, "Fair Jeanne" also does fall and spring group trips for organizations such as the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets, Girl Guides of Canada and corporate groups. The "Fair Jeanne" also offers trips for people who are working towards The Duke of Edinburgh's Awards.
The length overall of the ship is , length on deck , and length at the waterline . The beam width of the ship is . The mast height is carrying approximately of sail. Her hull is constructed of a steel frame with a thick fiber glass overlay. She draws , or 12 with the centreboard down, which allows her access to shallow docks.
History.
"Fair Jeanne" began her life in the backyard of the Thomas G. Fuller, D.S.C.** M.I.D. R.C.N. She was designed and built by Capt. Fuller at his home in Britannia-on-the-Bay in Ottawa, Ontario. The keel was laid in 1978 and she was launched in 1980. "Fair Jeanne" was sailed by Capt. Fuller and his wife, Jeanne (now patron of Bytown Brigantine Inc.) in the Caribbean and to his old haunts in the European Seas. During the past 15 years, the ship has logged over in service.
The Fuller Family founded Bytown Brigantine Foundation in 1984 utilizing "Fair Jeanne"s sister ship, the STV "Black Jack", whose port is the Britannia Yacht Club. After 14 years of faithful service to the family as a yacht, "Fair Jeanne" was brought into sail-training service as well, allowing Bytown Brigantine Inc. to expand its program and offer offshore sail training for youth between the ages of 15-18.
Present Day.
The "Fair Jeanne" took part in the Tall Ships 1812 Tour, a Pan Provincial event that traveled throughout Ontario during the summer of 2013, commemorating the bicentennial for the War of 1812. 16 ports participated in this event which is produced in partnership with the Tall Ships Challenge Great Lakes 2013 series. The first Port of Call for the tour was in Brockville, Ontario, Canada June 14–16, 2013.
On the morning of July 26, 2013 the "Fair Jeanne" was struck by a fishing tug while at anchor near Port Stanley Ontario. The impact left a 30 cm by 30 cm hole in the hull, approximately 1m above the water line. She was repaired in Port Stanley.

Chuitna Coal Project

The Chuitna Coal Project is a proposed coal strip mine that, if granted state and federal permits, would be built about southwest of Anchorage, Alaska, in an area known as the Beluga Coal Fields near the Chuitna River and the small communities of Tyonek and Beluga in upper Cook Inlet.
Proposal.
The Chuitna Coal Project is a proposal of PacRim LP, a Delaware-based corporation, which holds a state lease to of Alaska Mental Health Trust property where an estimated 1 billion metric tons of low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal is thought to exist. Proven reserves are reported to be 771 million tons. The company is in the advanced stages of state and federal mine-permitting processes. PacRim has surveyed three Logical Mining Units, or LMUs, within its lease. If permitted, the company has said it plans to extract up to 12 million metric tons of coal from the first of these units over a minimum period of 25 years. Other LMUs, could be developed in future years.
The surface coalmine itself could eventually spread to cover , but the project also would include assorted support facilities, a mine road and a long, covered conveyor system to transport coal to Cook Inlet at Ladd Landing where a port facility would be built. Ladd Landing is property owned by the Kenai Peninsula Borough and subject to a lease-option held by PacRim. A letter of intent to exercise the Ladd Landing option was filed by PacRim in March, 2009. For more, see Lease-Option History section below.
Only about 10 percent of Alaska's electricity is generated by coal, all of which is produced by the Usibelli Coal Mine, near Healy, Alaska. That operation supplies six Interior Alaska power plants and ships its surplus overseas. Currently, Alaska's coal-fired generating capacity has no need for the coal that would be produced at Chuitna. Thus, coal extracted from the Chuitna project would most likely be shipped to Asian markets, including South Korea, Japan and Mainland China, with other possible markets being Mexico and Chile. 
Interest in exploiting the resources in the Beluga Coal Fields has waxed and waned over the decades since the late 1960s, with the lease passing through a succession of corporate hands. The proposed Chuitna Coal Project has both proponents and opponents and is becoming increasingly controversial in the Cook Inlet region.
Geography.
The proposed Chuitna Coal Project mine site is located within PacRim's lease area designated as follows: Sec 14, 15, 21-28 and 33-36, T13N, R12W, Seward Meridian.
Land ownership.
Land within and around PacRim's lease area is owned by a variety of entities, including the State of Alaska, the Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority, the Kenai Peninsula Borough, the Tyonek Native Corp., Cook Inlet Region, Inc. (CIRI), and private owners. The state of Alaska owns about (including mental health lands), and coal leases have been issued on some , including the leased to PacRim. Two state wildlife refuges are near the project zone. They are the Susitna Flats Wildlife Refuge to the northeast, and the Trading Bay Wildlife Refuge to the southwest. According to the state, neither would be affected by the mining project. Tyonek Native Corp. owns more than to the southeast. CIRI owns a scattering of properties around the mine site. The Kenai Peninsula Borough owns south of the mine lease boundary and a small area of land around Beluga and Ladd Landing. Private land is mostly along the Cook Inlet coastline in Beluga, Tyonek, as well as at North Forelands and south of Granite Point, which are coastal locations south of Tyonek.
Lease-option history.
The Kenai Peninsula Borough-PacRim Ladd Landing lease-option document shows that in 1987, the borough entered a lease-option agreement with Tidewater Services Corp, which merged with Midgard Energy Co., in 1994. That year, Midgard assigned its option to Richard Bass, William Herbert Hunt, and William Herbert Hunt Trust Estate. The option was extended multiple times through years while coal mining in the state lease area remained financially impractical. Early in 2008, Bass, Hunt and the Hunt Trust Estate assigned the Ladd Landing option to PacRim Coal LP. In March 2009, PacRim signed a letter of intent to exercise its Ladd Landing option. As of April 2009, the Kenai Peninsula Borough's Land Management Office had begun the process of bringing that lease to closing under the existing 1987 terms, a process that had to be completed within 180 days. According to borough officials, the two sides will renegotiate terms they have mutually agreed are outdated and in need of revision.
Access.
No roads connect the project area to Alaska's highway system. The areas is accessible only by sea and air. Airstrips exist at Beluga and Tyonek. PacRim proposes to build a third airstrip in the project area. Conoco Phillips has a private strip south of the Beluga Power Plant. Gravel roads connect Tyonek and Beluga, and there are remnants of old roads used for logging, oil, gas and coal exploration efforts. Barge landing areas exist at Ladd Landing, Tyonek and Granite Point, and are used to supply local residents.
Risks and rewards of development.
Extracting coal from the Beluga Coal Fields is an idea decades old, but several factors have so far discouraged construction, including the costs associated with developing a mine, the market price of coal, the lack of demand for coal in Alaska, among others. In recent years, opposition to mining the fields has grown, specifically with respect to PacRim's Chuitna Coal Project, the project most advanced in state and federal permitting processes. Many Alaskans, including fisheries biologists, are voicing opposition because of the mine's proposed location amid environmentally important wetlands and because of the nature of coal itself. Critics charge that development would devastate more than of critical wildlife habitat and destroy of salmon spawning streams. There is no precedent in Alaska for permitting mining in active salmon streams, and no guarantee that post-mine mitigation would restore the ecosystems. Chuitna would be the first if permits were granted. Regarding coal itself, the U.S. has about a quarter of the world's reserves; its been called the Saudi Arabia of coal. U.S. coal-fired power plants generate roughly half the nation's electricity, according to the United States Department of Energy. But coal is problematic. It is dirtiest of fossil fuels, and burning it produces a third of the nation's carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas contributing to climate change.
Chuitna's developers predict mine construction and operation will produce between 300 and 350 good-paying jobs, and royalties to the state upwards of $350 million over the 25-year lifespan of the first Logical Mining Unit project. PacRim also expects numerous service contracts with the local business community. PacRim will develop Ladd Landing as a port (see above) for loading large vessels that would transport the coal to Asian markets. That port could be important for the future development of public and private property on the west side of Cook Inlet. The 300 million tons PacRim expects to excavate from its Chuitna mine is thought to equal two-thirds of the total recoverable coal in the Beluga Coal Fields. Some estimates put the total at around 500 million tons. If the transport infrastructure to Cook Inlet is built, it is likely that, over time, coal mining in the region would expand.
Environmental issues of the mining phase.
2006 revisions to PacRim's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) filing with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shows the company expects to discharge more than of mine area runoff daily into salmon-bearing tributaries of the Chuitna River, including Creek 2002 (Lone Creek), Creek 2003 (Middle Creek) and Creek 2004. That effluent would reach Cook Inlet. The NPDES documents demonstrate that PacRim anticipates a variety of discharge pollutants, including organic carbon, assorted suspended solids, ammonia, nitrates, oil and grease, and metals including aluminum, iron, and manganese. In addition, housing and other operational facilities would be expected to discharge small amounts of fecal coliform and residual chlorine. According to the NPDES filing, PacRim would build four sedimentation ponds to remove some suspended solids. Three ponds would receive runoff from areas affected by mining operations, the fourth would receive runoff from mine facilities. Four outfall locations would discharge effluent to the fresh water creeks, waterbodies that support all five species of Pacific salmon, as well as Dolly Varden and trout.
PacRim's mining project would carve through more than of Middle Creek. To date, no permit allowing mining operations to mine through and destroy a salmon stream has ever been issued by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources. Such a permit would be precedent-setting. Alaska has strict laws governing the protection of natural systems such as salmon streams. A clean, clear-water environment is crucial for successful natural salmon rearing. How those laws might be applied during the permitting process remains to be seen.
PacRim's planned port at Ladd Landing would affect existing shoreline salmon set net fishing sites and the coal-loading trestle necessary to reach deep water would have an impact on fish migration zones and the habitat of an endangered species of beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas also known as white whale) that is distinct to Cook Inlet. Under provisions of the 1973 Endangered Species Act, the National Marine Fisheries Service placed the Cook Inlet species on the nation's Endangered Species list. What effect that may have on permitting PacRim's port facilities has yet to be determined.
Post-mining environmental concerns.
Repairing the damage surface strip mining leaves behind is costly and a considerable physical enterprise. A specific federal law governs such recovery phases, and would apply to a Chuitna Coal Project. It is called the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. The act created the Office of Surface Mining within the U.S. Department of the Interior. State programs - in Alaska's case, the Alaska Division of Mining, Land & Water - generally regulate mines, but among the OSM's jobs is inspecting state programs to ensure they are meeting federal requirements.

John Taylor Jones

Rev. Dr. John Taylor Jones (July 16, 1802 – September 13, 1851) was one of the earliest Protestant missionaries to Siam (now Thailand) with his wife, Eliza Grew Jones. He is credited with introducing to Siam the modern world map, and producing a translation of the New Testament in Siamese (Thai) from Greek.
Biography.
Jones was born in New Ipswich, New Hampshire, on July 16, 1802, to Elisha and Persia Taylor Jones. He attended preparatory school at New Ipswich Academy and Bradford Academy. He attended Brown College from 1819–1820, and worked as a teacher from 1820-1823. He graduated from Amherst College in 1825, and undertook graduate studies at Andover Theological Seminary from 1827–1830, and then at Newton Theological Institution in 1830.
He married Eliza Grew Jones on July 14, 1830, and was ordained in Boston on July 28, 1830, as a missionary to Burma under the American Baptist Missionary Union (ABMU). He and his wife set sail for the country shortly thereafter. Rev. and Mrs. Jones worked with Adoniram Judson in Burma, residing for about two years at Maulmein, and later at Rangoon.
After Karl Gutzlaff petitioned the ABMU for more missionaries, the Rev. and Mrs. Jones were reassigned to Siam in 1832. Destined to became the first long-term Protestant missionaries in the country, they arrived in April 1833 on the schooner "Reliance" owned by the Reverend Robert Hunter, who was a friend of the Siamese foreign minister (known only by his office, that of praklang.) Rev. Hunter had interceded with him on behalf of Rev. Gutzlaff, who, in an excess of zeal, offended the Siamese within the first two days of his arrival by throwing thousands of tracts into many cottages, and every floating house, boat and junk– following which he was ordered expelled and his tracts burnt. Rev. Hunter persuaded the praklang to have the tracts translated for the king to read. The king found nothing objectionable in them, but said candidly and openly that he preferred his own religion. The Rev. and Mrs. Jones were made welcome in the accommodations of the embassy of diplomatist Edmund Roberts until their own could be made ready. Rev. Hunter introduced Rev. Jones to the praklang, who received him with apparent kindness, likely because they were American citizens. Roberts, indeed, had been told American negotiations for a treaty were proceeding at an unprecedented pace. Rev. Jones informed Roberts that Major Burney, the British ambassador at the court of Ava who had six years previously negotiated the Burney Treaty, told Rev. Jones that Americans were decidedly preferred to any other foreigners. The praklang sent down a boat to convey Rev. Jones and his family to their new residence at Cokai, which had been arranged by the French-, English-, and Siamese=speaking Portuguese consul Mr. Silveiro, near a campong of Burmese. The residence had been previously occupied by a Mr. Abeel, another American missionary, of whom Roberts writes: 
Mr. Abeel is held here in the highest estimation, by those who have the pleasure of his acquaintance. He possesses talents of a very superior order, and acquirements that do great credit to his industry; is mild and conciliating in his manners, forcible in his arguments, yet possessing a sufficient degree of zeal, never giving offence to the government, nor creating dislike by being over-zealous, and thereby disgusting the natives; but the bad state of his health would not permit him to remain on this good missionary ground, which may be made, in a few years, ready for the harvest.
Rev. Jones' proselytizing work was primarily with the Chinese in Bangkok. He founded a Chinese Baptist church in 1835. His first baptism was the re-baptism of Boon Tee, a Chaozhou Chinese who had previously been baptized by Gutzlaff, but not by immersion
Eliza Jones died of cholera at Bangkok on March 28, 1838. Rev. Jones remarried in November 1840, to Judith Leavitt. She died on March 21, 1846. He was married for a third and final time on August 20, 1847, to Sarah Sleeper (b. Gilford, New Hampshire, 1812-05-12 - d. Bangkok, 1889-04-30) who, after Jones' death in 1851, had in turn married Rev S.J. Smith on 1853-10-26. Sleeper served 42 years as a missionary in Bangkok
Jones died on 1851-09-13. He is buried at the Bangkok Protestant Cemetery.

Andriy Slyusarchuk

Andriy Tykhonovych Slyusarchuk (born May 9, 1971 in Zhytomyr) is a Ukrainian who became, among other things, neurosurgeon, medical doctor and professor. He also claims to have set a number of unverified world records in memorizing data and figures, while being able to perform highly complex computer-speed calculations mentally. He is commonly known as Doctor Pi.
Autumn 2011 the Ukrainian police detained Slyusarchuk on suspicion of forgery and fraud. In Summer 2012 he was placed in a psychiatric hospital.
Legend.
At nine, he graduated from Vinnytsia secondary school. His parents were medical professors: mother— a pediatrician, and father— a cardiac surgeon. They died in a car accident the same year he graduated from secondary school.
After that, he was put into a Soviet orphanage. In there, the teachers failed to recognize his extraordinary abilities and his attempts to show more skill than an ordinary child were subject to multiple punishments. He was taught to behave the same way other children did. Andriy was trying to get back his documents certifying his secondary school graduation to further enter a higher educational institution, but for trying that he was stamped a 'mentally disordered', 'lunatic' child and punished even more. At 11 years old, he ran away from the orphanage.
Upon arriving in Moscow, he entered a Gypsy environment, where he was accepted, fed, and taught to beg for money. At that time, he felt that was an environment he needed. There, he first learned about the phenomenon of Gypsy hypnotism and started to learn its use.
After about a year of life with the Gypsies, Andriy accidentally met an employee of Russian State Medical University. They became friends and that man started inviting Andriy to his place. Gradually Andriy told him his life story. With the help of that man Andriy was allowed to have an appointment with Yevgeniy Chazov, the Soviet Minister of Health Care at that time.
Under protectorate of Yevgeniy Chazov at the age of 12, Andriy Slyusarchuk entered Russian State Medical University, general therapy faculty. His further specialization was neurosurgery under guidance of professor Gusev, E.I. (Гусев Е.И.). His teachers were famous neuro-scientists like Karlov V.A. (Карлов В.А.), Konovalov A.N., Vein A.M. (Вейн А.М.).
He claims he graduated from Russian State Medical University with an Honorable Diploma at 18. 
And immediately after that by a decision of Scientific Council Andriy was directed to the postgraduate course, without the usually required internship.
Within 1.5 years after that, he received his first Ph.D. The thesis was "Ураження мозку, зумовлене герпетичними енцефалітами".
His subsequent Ph.D. thesis was «Травматические внутримозговые супратенториальные гематомы, осложнённые острой обструктивной гидроцефалией и прорывом крови в желудочковую систему.»
He claims he had received his third higher education by the age of 28.
Some dates (according to the press information):
He is currently a professor of L'viv State University of Modern Technologies and Management 
He was previously a professor at the chair of neuro-surgery in National Medical Academy of postgraduate education named after Shupyk <http://kmapo.edu.ua/en/academy/jubilee>. By 2010 he has left his position there.
In June 2009, after claiming to have set a new world record for memorizing pi by being able to recite randomly selected sequences from the first 30 million places of pi, Mr. Slyusarchuk was officially congratulated by the President of Ukraine Viktor Yuschenko. A possibility of financing a dedicated research center for development of Slyusarchuk's methodology had been discussed.
On December 22, 2009, a press release has been issued by the press relations department of President of Ukraine, which announced that Viktor Yushchenko met with Andriy Slyusarchuk and discussed the establishing of the Institute of Brain Studies. The aim of the Institute is to ensure a complex approach to detecting and medication of the brain diseases, introduction of the contemporary methods of their prevention and treatment. The President has marked the importance of scientific studies of human brain and the significance of practical use of achieved results in education, medicine, social sphere. Taking into account the aims and directions of activity of the established Institute, conducting of such studies and measures will allow to solve, in particular, the issues of fighting the narcotic and alcohol dependence, as well as other complex social problems. President has issued a Decree, which makes provisions for establishment of Institute of Brain Studies, as a main research institution, which determines the top priority directions of brain study, conducting fundamental and applied scientific research in neurology, psychiatry, psychology and neuro-rehabilitation, development, introduction and realization of the programs of research into brain functioning, new technologies in this sphere. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine is charged with ensuring the solution of all the legal and other issues related to establishing of Institute of Brain Studies, accordingly to the legislative procedure, within one month from the issue of Decree.
In his interview to "Weekly Mirror" (one of the major Ukrainian newspapers) published December 26, 2009, Andriy Slyusarchuk says it has been planned that he would become the head of the newly created Institute of Brain Studies, which would create suitable conditions for this work in Ukraine and remove the need for immigration in order to continue his studies.
Slyusarchuk claims his unique memorizing skills are based on a set of techniques including mental associations between figures, images, words, numbers (i.e. mnemonics) and an innate photographic memory of everything he concentrates on. The scientists participating at the verification of Mr. Slyusarchuk's records said that "...the mnemonic technique implied can be used by any person...".
A February 2010 article in Novaya newspaper mentions that a student of Andriy Slyusarchuk (Alexander Chervonyi) also claims that he was able to reproduce many of his master's claimed memory performances, including recitation of any randomly selected sequences from the first 5 million decimal places of pi. The article also provides information about the current experiments performed by Mr. Slyusarchuk and his assistants and claims they are related to development of new techniques of mind-control for the military.
He lately took interest in chess and allegedly read three thousand books on the subject. In April 2011 he defeated the chess program Rybka in an exhibition Match in Kiev, blindfolded.
Claims and controversy.
Suspicion of forgery and fraud.
Journalists of L'viv newspaper "Ekspres", in a series of publications in October–November 2011, accused Andriy Slyusarchuk of forgery, fraud, illegal medical practice, which led to injuries and deaths of patients treated by him.
After the accusations in "Ekspres" had been published and gained wide publicity, Andriy Slyusarchuk publicly denied them and pleaded himself not guilty in a number of interviews to other press sources. He announced that he had resorted to court and applied to General Prosecutor of Ukraine in order to clarify the situation and officially disprove the statements made by "Ekspres".
On November 14, 2011, under the pressure of press (particularly the "Ekspres" newspaper), the Ukrainian police had detained him for the period of investigation on suspicion of forgery and fraud.
In the process of investigation, the high officials of the Ministry of Education and Science,
In Summer 2012, Ukrainian newspapers reported that Andriy Slyusarchuk left Lukyanivska Prison and has been placed in the Pavlov psychiatric hospital. The Head of Department for Public Affairs of MIA of Ukraine, Volodymyr Polishchuk said that "independent examination is conducted to check the mental health of Slyusarchuk, as well as his possible psychic and hypnotic abilities"
Pi figure.
Slyusarchuk claims to have set a number of records in memorizing large volumes of digital data, sequences of geometrical figures, as well as words and other information. In particular, he claims to have memorized 1 million digits of pi figure.
By 2008 he claimed to remember 2,000,000 decimal places of pi, as well as around 7,000 volumes of text. By 2009 the number of volumes remembered increased to 15.000.
By June 2009 he claimed to have set a new record by memorizing the first 30 million places of pi, which were printed in 20 volumes of text. Although he did not recite all 30 million digits that he claimed to have memorized, he was able to recite randomly selected sequences from within the first 30 million places of pi.
Since reciting 30 million digits of π at one digit a second would take almost a year (347 days) if you did it non-stop 24 hours a day, seven days a week, a following approach had been applied to verify the record: during demonstrations Mr. Slyusarchuk is being randomly asked to tell the digits of pi printed on certain pages and locations of the 20 volume printout, which is grouped into orderly arranged tables. He successfully went through this kind of test multiple times. Demonstrations had been witnessed by respectable scientists and heads of sub-departments in Universities. Book of Records of Ukraine (Книга рекордів України) lists the members of commission witnessing his demonstration. They are country-wide recognized scientists on the top positions in National Universities and Institutes. 
By October 2010 Mr. Slyusarchuk claimed to remember 200 million decimal places of pi. 
None of his claimed Pi records is accepted by the official Pi World Ranking List or the Guinness Book of Records since no real independent test of his pi knowledge was possible ever.
Mr. Slyusarchuk is known for his hypnotic skills as well. In particular, he claims to be able to hypnotize people so as to not feel pain, e.g. when exposed to burns.
Another TV show presented him hypnotizing students of L'viv University of Modern Technologies (Львівський державний інститут новітніх технологій та управління ім. В. Чорновола). Those under hypnotic influence could eat onions believing those were apples.
He also demonstrated hypnotizing a salesman in a shop to take a 1 hryvna bill from him, believing this to be 500 Hryvna.
Novyi Kanal has hosted a few TV events in which Andriy Slyusarchuk demonstrated many of his extraordinary abilities. The Video recording of the events is available at http://video.novy.tv/video/3/24/9842.html .
When trying to show exceptional Chess position memory on TV (memorizing all pieces on 80 boards), he was criticized by a chess master invited to the event (Grigoriy Timoshenko), who said he was 99.9% sure that Slyusarchuk's performance was faked. An article in The New York Times called Slyusarchuk "an Illusionist".
He was also officially invited to participate in the World Memory Championships, where his feats would have been tested by independent international arbiters. He was promised $40,000 if he broke the accepted memory records, but he refused to go there.

Gustav Naan

Gustav Naan (, "Gustav Iogannovich Naan"; 17 May 1919 near Vladivostok – 12 January 1994 in Tallinn) was an Estonian physicist and philosopher.
Gustav Naan was born in Russian SFSR in a village near Vladivostok to a family of Estonian settlers. He graduated from the Leningrad State University in 1941. He took part in World War II and joined the CPSU in 1943. Having settled to Estonia after the USSR annexed Estonia, Gustav Naan, a loyal communist and graduate of the Higher Party School of the AUCP(b) (1946). published a number of Stalinist-oriented polemic pieces (treating Estonian history and politics from the pro-Soviet perspective, e.g. “Eesti kodanlike natsionalistide ideoloogia reaktsiooniline olemus″ ('The Reactionary Essence of the Ideology of Estonian Bourgeois Nationalists'), 1947). In 1948, Naan published an article in "Voprosy filosofii" on the philosophical implications of the theory of relativity, criticizing 'physical idealists' of the US and Britain; in 1951, however, he published an article that decried vulgar materialist critics of the relativity theory whilst being ″tolerant on philosophic questions to a striking degree in Stalinist Russia, considering its place and time of publication″. Authors who followed Naan's article into discussion were almost universally critical of Naan's position. In 1952, which was the most intense year of the debate, three different authors published against Naan in the 1952 first issue of "Voprosy filosofii" alone.
Naan was the director of the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences of the Estonian SSR (1950–1951), Vice-President of the Academy of Sciences of the Estonian SSR (1951–1964). From 1964, Naan worked at the Institute of Astrophysics and Atmosphere Physics of the Academy of Sciences of the Estonian SSR. Having turned to theorizing on cosmology, cybernetics and demography, he often rejected taboos of both the 'traditional' world-view and orthodox communist opinions on such matters. He later claimed to have been one of the promoters of the theory of relativity at the time this was still considered pseudoscience by the Soviet authorities. He also proposed the Symmetric Universe hypothesis, according to which, side by side with the ordinary world, there is an anti-world.
Naan was editor-in-chief of "Eesti nõukogude entsüklopeedia" (literally: "Estonian Soviet Encyclopedia"), the first edition of which started in late 1960s.
In terms of political affiliations, Naan remained a staunch supporter of the communist system and was a devote opponent of Estonia's pro-independence movement; Naan supported the (pro-Moscow) Internationalist Movement. Having gained much public support in 1970s for his relatively bold opinion pieces on topics like family, morals and sex, he soon became a despised figure for his anti-independence stance, which was reflected in his newspaper articles of the time (e.g. his article «С ног на голову» ('From (standing on) Feet to (standing on) Head', Estonian title “Kõik pea peale″), condemning the Estonian Sovereignty Declaration passed by the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR, was published in "Pravda", 23. November 1988.).
Gustav Naan was despised by many who considered him a careerist and schemer.

You Have to Burn the Rope

You Have to Burn the Rope is a 2008 online Flash game developed by Swedish student Kian Bashiri under the name Mazapán.
Gameplay.
"You Have to Burn the Rope" is a platform game in which the player must guide the character through a short level through which text on how to beat the game is clearly visible. At the end of the level, the player has a boss fight against the "Grinning Colossus". To beat the boss, the player must jump to one of the torches on the wall and use it to burn the rope attaching a chandelier to the ceiling, dropping it on the boss. The character can throw axes which lower the Grinning Colossus' health bar. However, the health bar regenerates too fast for the player to completely drain.
At the end there is a short section of credits which includes the all-original song "Now You're A Hero", composed by Henrik Nåmark. The entirety of the game is often shorter than the credits song itself, which runs for 2:13.
Despite the simplicity of the game, both a text and video walkthrough have been released.
Reception.
"You Have to Burn the Rope" was a finalist for the Innovation Award at the 2009 Independent Games Festival.
Joystiq praised the game for its "stunning character design, addictive gameplay, and breathtaking soundtrack," calling the game "a smörgåsbord of top-notch writing, programming, and design."
Dan Hopper of "Best Week Ever" said ""You Have To Burn The Rope" Is By Far The Greatest Online Game I Have Ever Played."
On the online website Kongregate, there has been a badge entitled ""You have to earn the badge"". This is earned by defeating Grinning Colossus.

STV Black Jack

STV "Black Jack" is a brigantine operated by the Ottawa-based youth charity Bytown Brigantine, Inc. Black Jack sails on the historic Ottawa River between Brittania Yacht Club and Quyon, Quebec. On May 2, 2004, the STV "Black Jack" was designated ""Ottawa's Signature Tall Ship"".
"Black Jack" was the first ship in service with Bytown Brigantine, Inc., a charitable organization devoted to providing sail training adventure for youth. This brigantine is home to 15 youth between the ages of 12 and 15 during the summer months. The program is designed to develop character and foster leadership, confidence and self-reliance in youth through the medium of sail training. Her sister ship STV "Fair Jeanne" is also in use by Bytown Brigantine on the Great Lakes and Canada's east coast.
"Black Jack" is steel-hulled with wooden bilge keels. Her sparred length is , length on deck , and beam . She draws , which allows her to go almost anywhere a keelboat can, which is very useful when maneuvering the Ottawa River and docking at her berth in Britannia Yacht Club. She can be seen at the yacht club but is not open to the public except on special occasions. Her mast height is and she carries a total of of sail area on 9 sails. 
History.
"Black Jack" was originally a logging tug on the Upper Ottawa River and was based in Quyon, Quebec. She was built in Scotland in 1904 and made her way to Canada that same year. In 1952, the ship was converted by the late Captain Thomas G. Fuller into a Brigantine. She operated as the Fuller family yacht for several years until her sister ship STV Fair Jeanne was built in 1982. Rather than see the ship fall into disuse, Captain Fuller's son, Simon Fuller, refitted the ship with the intention of using her as a sail training vessel. She made her sail training debut in 1983 and in the summer of 1984 attended the 450th Anniversary of Jacques Cartier's Landing in Quebec City with many other international tall ships. Since then, "Black Jack" has remained on the Ottawa River where she is the focal point of the Black Jack Island Adventure Camp for youth.
In 2004, "Black Jack" celebrated her centennial birthday. Her Excellency Adrienne Clarkson, then Governor General of Canada, re-christened the "Black Jack" at Britannia Yacht Club and helped Bytown Brigantine wish the ship well on her next 100 years of service in the Ottawa area. 
In 2012, "Black Jack" helped Britannia Yacht Club celebrate her 125th anniversary.
Black Jack Island Adventure Camp.
"Black Jack" is now part of a sail-training summer camp for youth 12 – 15 years old on the Ottawa River. Based on a private island near Fitzroy Harbour, Ontario, participants become immersed in an environment that could be described as Peter Pan meets the Pirates of the Caribbean. Campers are swept up in the training and challenge it takes to sail a tall ship. Under direction of the ship's certified Master, participants work closely with crew to learn all aspects of seamanship, from hoisting sails and learning basic navigation to tying knots and steering the ship. 
The island is used to teach campers other aspects of sailing, navigation and teamwork through popular games like the “Great Canadian Buoy Hunt” and the “Island Bridge Challenge”. Evenings on the island are filled with camp fires and extremely popular island-wide Manhunt or Capture-the-Flag games which can become very competitive. Participants sleep either aboard "Black Jack" (on deck or down below depending on weather), or on a floating bunkhouse moored at the island. At the end of a long day, participants find their beds on an authentic floating bunkhouse, the Stanley Carson Bunk Barge.
Black Jack's Fleet.
Black Jack camp would not be complete without its support fleet of two navy whalers and two barges, affectionately known as 'Waterworld' when all together. The two whalers, "Agnes Irving" and "Alan E. Jacques", are incredibly sturdy -long traditional navy boats that can be sailed or rowed with sweeps. They have two masts, a lug-rigged main mast and a driving mizzen, as well as being equipped with diesel outboards. They were traditionally used as training boats by the Royal Canadian Navy and are very popular with campers for exploring and racing.
Two barges are kept moored at the island during the summer months. The Stanley Carson Bunk Barge is an authentic logging bunkhouse that was used by loggers on the Ottawa River. The two-story barge provides accommodation and cooking facilities for up to 30 people. The second barge is equipped as a well-stocked supply barge, large enough to carry vehicles and equipment.

Shum Laka

The archaeological site of Shum Laka is the most prominent site in the Laka Valley of northwest Cameroon. Located approximately 15 kilometers from the town of Bamenda, it resides on the inner wall of the Bafochu Mbu caldera.
History.
To quote the abstract of Cornelissen (2003):
The rock shelter of Shum Laka, situated in the Grassfields of northwestern Cameroon, was occupied during the later Pleistocene and Holocene. Plant remains reveal that there were no drastic changes in the immediate environment of the shelter between 30,000 and 10,000 bp. The industry is microlithic during this entire period. Quartz was deliberately chosen as the preferred raw material and there were no changes in technology or raw material usage over time. A comparison with similar sites in the northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo reveals that the microlithic quartz tradition was apparently appropriate for the exploitation of a wide variety of environmental settings. This flexibility may represent an adequate technological response to the environmental changes in Central Africa at the end of the Pleistocene.
Abstract of Lavachery (2001)
Until recently the Grassfields (western Cameroon), cradle of the Bantu languages, were an unknown zone from the archaeological point of view. The excavations of Shum Laka rock shelter by de Maret and his team brought the most complete sequence in West Africa, spanning the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene. After 20 millennia of microlithic tradition (Late Stone Age), a new culture, with macrolithic tools, polishing and pottery (Stone to Metal Age), slowly developed ca. 7000 B.P. onwards. From this early period on, forest hunting was associated with the exploitation of "Canarium schweinfurthii". Around 4000 B.P., an industry with waisted axes, blades, and pottery had emerged. With a striking technological continuity, this culture survived throughout the Iron Age. Increasing importance and diversity of trees exploited through the Stone to Metal Age and the Iron Age suggests arboriculture. Regional comparisons show that, between 5000 and 2500 B.P., an original culture developed in the Grassfields and the Cross River basin.
World Heritage Status.
This site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on April 18, 2006 in the Cultural category.

Daw Mill

Daw Mill was a coal mine located near the village of Arley, near Nuneaton, in the English county of Warwickshire. The mine was Britain's biggest coal producer. On 7 March 2013 the owner, UK Coal, announced the mine would be closed following a major fire. It was the last remaining colliery in the West Midlands.
The mine.
Daw Mill mined a five-metre thick section of the Warwickshire Coalfield (known as the "Warwickshire Thick") in the north of the county. It was owned and operated by UK Coal and in 2008 employed 680 people.
The two shafts that served Daw Mill were first sunk between 1956 and 1959, and 1969 and 1971 respectively. The mine was a natural extension of the former collieries Kingsbury Colliery and Dexter Colliery, both of which have also closed. In 1983 an inclined tunnel linking underground workings with the surface was completed. This drift mining enabled Daw Mill to increase its production capacity as it removed the often time-consuming process of winding coal up the shafts.
Daw Mill was the last surviving mine in a county that once had 20 operating collieries. In 2008 it excavated 3.25 million tons of coal, beating a 13-year-old record for annual output at a British coal mine set at Selby in North Yorkshire.
Transport.
The colliery was situated on the Birmingham to Nuneaton Line, just east of the former Shustoke railway station. Trains were operated by GB Railfreight.
Accidents.
Three men were killed at Daw Mill in mining accidents in 2006 and 2007. In 2011 UK Coal was fined £1.2 million for safety breaches.
On 22 February 2013, a major fire broke out underground, described as the worst underground blaze in Britain for 30 years. UK Coal and Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service confirmed that 92 workers were safely extracted. As of 3 March 2013 the fire had still not been fully extinguished. It was initially estimated that remedial work to the colliery could take between three and six months, making a return to production subject to a further review, resulting in the possible immediate closure of the mine.
Closure.
On 14 March 2012 it was reported that UK Coal had begun a consultation process as part of plans for a company restructure which could see the closure of the mine in 2014.
On 10 July 2012, UK Coal had suggested that if High Speed 2 were to be built, then Daw Mill would be forced to close due to associated development and the effects on local groundworks.
On 7 March 2013 UK Coal announced the closure of the mine, due to the destructive fire which had extensively damaged it, with the plan to make most of the 650 staff redundant.

ISCTE – Lisbon University Institute

ISCTE – University Institute of Lisbon, abbreviated ISCTE-IUL (in Portuguese "ISCTE - Instituto Universitário de Lisboa"), is a Portuguese public university institute, located in the centre of Lisbon in the University City campus.
In the past, ISCTE-IUL was named "Instituto Superior de Ciências do Trabalho e da Empresa" abbreviated "ISCTE" (in English "Higher Institute of Business and Labour Sciences"), but that name was dropped in 2009 when ISCTE-IUL was changed to a university institute with foundational nature (along with the University of Porto and the University of Aveiro).
Schools.
ISCTE-IUL is constituted by four schools:
Teaching Programmes.
ISCTE-IUL comprises about 7,500 students at both undergraduate and graduate levels and close to 400 professors. The ISCTE – University Institute of Lisbon confers all levels of academic degrees in Anthropology, Sociology, History, Social psychology, Political Science, Planning, Architecture, Economics, Finance, Business administration and Management, Human Resources, Marketing, Computer Science, Telecommunications Engineering, Industrial Engineering, amongst many other post-graduate programs.
History.
ISCTE-IUL was established in Lisbon in 1972 as ISCTE using the faculty and facilities of the "Instituto de Estudos Sociais" (Institute of Social Studies, founded in 1963) as a first step towards a new and innovative public university in Lisbon. Its present designation dates from 2009.
From its creation ISCTE-IUL was authorized to grant the bachelor's degree and the licenciatura degree, which was granted after completion of a four to five years long program that often required writing a final dissertation and thus was roughly equivalent to the current master's degree, instituted as part of the Bologna process. From 1983 onwards, ISCTE-IUL was also authorized to grant the master's degree, which was higher than the current Bologna process master's degree but still lower than a doctorate degree).
What was to be the first college of a never completed larger projected university (due to the carnation revolution of 1974) always remained as a non-integrated University Institute - situation that was institutionalized in 1988. From that date onwards, ISCTE-IUL grants all academic degrees, comprising Bachelors, Masters, PhDs, Honorary doctorates and Habilitations (called "Agregação" in Portuguese).
ISCTE-IUL is today part of both the Fundação das Universidades Portuguesas (Foundation of Portuguese Universities) and the Conselho de Reitores das Universidades Portuguesas (Council of Rectors of the Portuguese Universities). It is also one of the few public universities in Portugal with a foundational nature, together with the University of Porto and the University of Aveiro.
Research units.
This ISCTE-IUL comprises quality research centers in all its domains. The major ISCTE-IUL research centers are:

Sacred Oath

Sacred Oath is an American heavy metal band from Bethel, Connecticut.
History.
Sacred Oath was originally formed in 1985 by Rob Thorne and Pete Altieri while the two were classmates at Bethel High School. The band recorded their first demo in 1985 and quickly sold hundreds of them through local stores like Record Broker and Phoenix Records, developing a loyal following referred to as the "Oathbangers." 
They signed a recording contract with the Mercenary Records label in 1986, shortly after recording their second demo "Shadow Out Of Time". By then the band was becoming known internationally in an underground circuit. Members Rob Thorne, Pete Altieri, Glen Cruciani, and Kenny Evans recorded Sacred Oath's debut album "A Crystal Vision" in May 1987 at Presence Studios in East Haven CT, where Dave Obrizzo produced and Jon Russell engineered. The album was released in 1988 on vinyl, cassette, and CD and went on to garner cult-classic status as one of the pioneer efforts of the American power metal movement.
The band disbanded in December 1988 before the album had caught on, due to creative disagreements and frustration with their failing record label. Mercenary Records and its parent label Celluloid Records went bankrupt soon after.
Sentinel Steel Records reissued the debut album in 2001 through an exclusive agreement with the band. The band reformed and re-recorded the songs from that album, releasing them as "A Crystal Revision" in 2005. Rob and Kenny continued to record as Sacred Oath, issuing the critically acclaimed comeback album "Darkness Visible" in 2007 with all four original members.
In 2008 they released a live album '"Till Death Do Us Part" recorded during their tour of Europe. This album featured a new guitarist (Billy Smith) and a new bass player (Scott Waite), and established the band as back and fully active in the current music world.
In 2009, the new lineup of Sacred Oath recorded their self-titled album, "Sacred Oath," featuring their first single, "Counting Zeros." Counting Zeros is BMI Work No. 10339363.
The music video has featured on MTV2's "Headbangers Ball" along with an interview. However, after recording the album, bassist Scott Waite parted ways before playing any shows. New bass player, Brendan Kelleher, has taken his place and will be playing with Sacred Oath on their world tour. For the week of April 7, 2009 Sacred Oath's Counting Zeros was the "Discovery Download Pick Of The Week" on iTunes.
In 2010, Sacred Oath Announced that they were coming out with a new album titled World On Fire. The Album was released on October 5, 2010 after being recorded at Angel Thorne Music Company.
In 2013, the band released a throwback album, titled Fallen, featuring songs from past band members. New songs were added as well, including the title track, Fallen, which paid homage to the Sandy Hook Killings in December 2012.

"The Guardian" named Zarif "the next big thing in British soul" and "Billboard" Magazine said she was like "Amy Winehouse with Madonna's pop flair."
Also "theguardian.co.uk" described Zarif as a "chirpy, sassy cross between Lily Allen and Corinne Bailey Rae, or a lighter, frothier, poppier Amy Winehouse".
"Touch" Magazine said Zarif "exudes the kind of delicious, chocolaty tones and gut-wrenching melodies that Scott, Stone and even Wonder would applaud" and Hot Press said she has "a voice like a 21st century Diana Ross."
She is often compared to Amy Winehouse, however Zarif has said, "People are always going to try and find a comparison. I think our music's actually very different," to Digital Spy, "Obviously we're both kind of retro, but music is a lot more upbeat and eclectic whereas Winehouses' is more influenced by Motown. I can definitely see the similarities but I think at the same time that we do different things."

Walter Landor Dickens

Walter Savage Landor Dickens (8 February 1841 – 31 December 1863) was the fourth child and second son of English novelist Charles Dickens and his wife Catherine. He became an officer cadet in the East India Company's Presidency armies just before the Indian Mutiny. The mutiny resulted in the British Crown extending direct rule to India, and Dickens continued to serve in what was now becoming the British Indian Army until his death.
Biography.
Named after his godfather Walter Savage Landor, Walter Dickens was christened at St Marylebone parish church on 4 December 1841, after which Charles Dickens held a celebratory party. The guests included Elliotson, Landor, Maclise, Macready, Stanfield and Talfourd. Walter was educated at Wimbledon. Nicknamed 'Young Skull' by his father, Walter Dickens showed early signs of aspiring to be an author like his father, but Charles Dickens instructed Walter's tutor to encourage him to not write, stating "The less he is encouraged to write the better, and the happier he will be." Instead, through the influence of Angela Burdett-Coutts, Walter became a cadet in the East India Company, leaving England for India in 1857 aged 16 at the start of the Indian Mutiny. At this time there was no single unified army in India. Each of the three Presidencies of India had its own army, and, in addition, a limited number of British Army units were also stationed in India.
After seeing Walter off at Southampton with his oldest son Charley, Charles Dickens was very upset for a few days but soon recovered and was satisfied that he had provided a career for his son, even though Walter was not suited to the life his father had chosen for him. Charles Dickens wrote, "A sad trial, thank God it is over. The dear boy bore it a great deal better than we could have hoped." Walter never returned home and his father was never to see him again. 
Following the introduction of direct rule in India in the wake of the mutiny, the armed forces were reorganized. A notice published in the "London Gazette" dated 1 March 1864 granted all those serving with "Her Majesty's Indian Forces on the 18th February 1861" rank in the British Army; Walter Dickens was amongst those listed with the rank of lieutenant. He served in the 26th Native Infantry Regiment, and was attached to the 42nd Regiment of Foot (The Black Watch) with that rank when he fell heavily into debt causing his health to break down. He was due to be invalided back to England but died of an aortic aneurysm on New Year's Eve at the Officers' Hospital in Calcutta in India. He is buried in Park Street Cemetery, in Calcutta.
His father did not receive the news of Walter's death until his own birthday on February 7 1864. Later, he received Walter's unpaid bills. 
Walter Dickens's name appears with those of his nine siblings on the monument next to his mother Catherine Dickens's grave in Highgate Cemetery in London. His brother Sydney Dickens, who was buried at sea in the Indian Ocean, is also commemorated there. His sister Dora Dickens is buried with her mother.

<doc id="21625372" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21625372" title="Pier Saccone Tarlati di Pietramala">
Pier Saccone Tarlati di Pietramala

Pier Saccone Tarlati di Pietramala (1261–1356) was an Italian condottiero from Pietramala d'Arezzo in the Val d'Arno, a "rocca" that controlled the mule track between his native town of Arezzo and Anghiari. Pietramala ("Bad rock") was the seat of the powerful family of the Tarlati, who came to prominence in the strife following Arezzo's decisive defeat at Campaldino (1289) as heads of the Ghibelline "Secchi" faction of Arezzo. Pier Saccone's brother was Guido Tarlati, bishop and "signore" of Arezzo. 
Pier Saccone, during a fighting career that lasted to his final days, held for periods of time the lordships of Anghiari, Arezzo, Città di Castello, Sansepolcro, Bibbiena, Chiusi Subbiano and Castiglion Fiorentino, in addition to numerous smaller strongholds.
In 1312, with his brother Tarlatino Tarlatini, he was in the retinue of Henry of Luxembourg, Holy Roman Emperor at Rome. In August 1315 he participated at the battle of Montecatini, at the head of 140 gentlemen of Arezzo. In 1320 his reputation was assured through his acquisition of numerous castelli from Guido Novello da Polenta, the host of Dante in exile. In October 1323 he was invested with Città di Castello. In February 1327 he paid court in Milan to Ludwig of Bavaria, King of Germany, who was crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy by his brother Guido, bishop of Arezzo,; in October that year, at the death of Guido, he was made Lord of the city, for the space of one year; however, after he attended the coronation in Rome of Ludwig as Holy Roman Emperor the following January and was excommunicated in March 1328 by John XXII along with the Emperor and the major members of his party, the Emperor formally invested him as "Signore" of Arezzo and Città di Castello, in December, following the death of his brother, who had held the position for his lifetime. Pier Saccone's rule marked a rapid decline in the fortunes of Arezzo, which had reached their apogee under the bishop his brother.
He took Sansepolcro in March 1329, after eight months of siege and unusually high casualties, but failed to take Cortona through a conspiracy, his favoured technique. That began a series of violent encounters with forces of Florence and Perugia that ended in March 1337, when he sold the "signoria" of Arezzo to the Florentines, for 42,800 florins and the back payment of his troops. Thus Ghibelline Arezzo passed for the first time under the power of Guelf Florence.He and Tarlatino were received with great public honors in Florence and fought as allies of Florence in campaigns during the next years, until he failed in a Ghibelline attempt to seize power in Arezzo once more and was taken in chains to Florence, January 1342. In May Walter of Brienne, who controlled Florence, released him and restored to him his castello of Bibbiena. In June his partisans were foiled in another attempt on Arezzo, with much damage to palazzi and the city's walls and gates.
In the spring of 1343, following the terms of a truce between Guelfs and Ghibbeline, Pier Saccone exchanged some recently acquired castelli for Rondine. That summer, with Brienne expelled from Florence, Pier Saccone moved again to take control of Arezzo, held by Buodelmonti, whio had the confidence of the Aretini. Pier Saccone ravaged the countryside round about. Capturing Castiglion Fiorentino and its rich treasury of 7,000 florins, Pier Saccone confiscated belongings and imprisoned men and women, some of who were tortured to extort their goods. The following fighting season he turned against the forces of Perugia and came to terms again with the Florentines in 1345; however, in 1351 he was in league with the Visconti, his old enemies the Ubertini and the Pazzi of Val d'Arno against the Florentine commune.

United States Pirate Party

The Pirate Party is an American political party founded in 2006 by Brent Allison, Alex English. The party's platform is aligned with the global Pirate movement, and supports reform of intellectual property laws to reflect open source and free culture values, government transparency, protection of privacy and civil liberties, rolling back corporate personhood and corporate welfare, evidence-based policy, and egalitarianism and meritocracy based on the hacker ethic.
The party's national organization has existed in multiple incarnations since its 2006 founding. Its most recent is the Pirate National Committee (PNC), formed in 2012 as a coalition of state parties. The PNC officially recognizes Pirate parties from 8 states, and tracks and assists the growth of more state parties throughout the United States.
History.
The Pirate Party was founded in June 2006 by University of Georgia graduate student Brent Allison in response to the success of the Swedish Piratpartiet. Its platform was focused primarily on intellectual property reform and freedom from Internet censorship. The party first attempted to register in Utah during the 2007/2008 election cycle but failed to collect the required number of Statements of Support. In 2011, the Massachusetts Pirate Party became the first legally recognized Pirate Party in the US. By 2011, the Pirate Party reported over 3000 members nationwide.
In 2012, a coalition of state Pirate parties formed the Pirate National Committee (PNC). By July of that year, the PNC drafted and adopted a new constitution, which outlined a broader ideology inspired by Rickard Falkvinge's Pirate Wheel.
Name.
The Pirate Party defends their oft-criticized name in the preamble of the PNC's constitution:
Ideology.
Factions within the Pirate Party include left-libertarians, classical liberals, anarchists, progressives, and radical centrists. Many Pirates explicitly decline to identify with any particular political ideology or philosophy.
The Pirate Party's platform originally centered on issues of intellectual property. "Like its international counterparts, the USPP’s main practical concerns are digital intellectual property and privacy laws—specifically, the abolition of a 1998 digital U.S. copyright law, the reduction of copyrights to 14 years (from 95 years after publication, or 70 years after the author’s death), and the expiration of patents that don’t result in significant progress within four years (as opposed to 20 years)."
In 2012, the party began an expansion of its platform, inspired by the Pirate Wheel. The party emphasizes the cultural values of the hacker ethic, open source and free culture, strong protection of individual civil liberties, government transparency and participatory governance, and evidence-based policy.
As of 2013, the national Pirate Party has not adopted an agenda beyond a set of 8 core values. Individual state parties are given free rein to interpret these values and experiment with more concrete platforms. Pirate candidates from New York have interpreted these values to espouse co-operative economics, workplace democracy, and self-employment.
PNC.
Captain.
Prior to 2012, the Chairperson of the party was elected every July by a membership vote, as established in the party constitution. After the 2012 formation of the PNC, the role's name was changed to Captain.

Des Newton (model maker)

Dennis (Des) Newton (10 May 1942- 30 January 2009), was a noted maker of model ships in bottles, holding the world record for the smallest whisky bottle in which two ships were inserted. Newton appeared on Blue Peter, placing a Blue Peter badge in a bottle.
Newton, born in Barrow-in-Furness when the town was still Lancashire, England grew up with boats and eventually became a welder in the towns shipyards. He said that because he was small, he was always the one "picked out to weld the inside of the rudders and masts and other nasty places were no other person could reach."
Newton also placed a model Royal Yacht Britannia in a bottle for the Queen, noting that the model was a "very difficult one", citing details such as Royal standards and "glazed cockpit screens on the royal barge". 
Newton worked as a "ship in a bottle" demonstrator at the Merseyside Maritime Museum for over 20 years.
In 1989, Newton was awarded the Lifeboatman statuette for his services to the RNLI. Des and his wife were jointly made Life Governors of the RNLI.

Protext (Arnor)

Protext is a British word processing program, developed by Arnor Ltd, of Peterborough in the decade following 1985. Originally written for the Amstrad CPC464, it was later sold for the Amstrad PCW series of word processors, for MS-DOS based PCs, the Atari ST, and the Commodore Amiga. A version was developed for the Acorn Archimedes and released in October 1990 which ran in full screen text mode, an accompanying note in the box mentioned Arnor's intention to develop a future release that would support operation in the RISC OS desktop with drag and drop capabilities, etc. but this was never developed.
In 1991 Arnor were commissioned by Amstrad to develop a special version of Protext for the NC100 portable computer. This was included in the ROM on the NC100 and NC200. Translated versions of Protext were published in German, French and Swedish. The German version was known as Prowort due to a name conflict.
After the closure of Arnor in 1995, the program was taken over by a group of enthusiasts including the original authors: Mark Tilley and Gavin Every; and relaunched with a new version for the PC. A companion database program Prodata was also sold. Since December 2008, Protext together with manuals and technical information has been freely downloadable, in formats for PC, Commodore Amiga and Atari ST.
Protext was designed for speed and flexibility and features the usual word processing features, such as a spell checker, thesaurus, auto-correction and good printer support. While later releases supported use of a mouse, the fastest editing with Protext would be using the keyboard, with all commonly used editing commands available with control key combinations.
An unusual feature of Protext is its programmability. A mail merge programming language allows the user to input data from a text file or Prodata database. This is achieved by 'Stored commands' within the body of the text, an idea borrowed from the 'dot commands' of WordStar. Stored commands are similarly used to control formatting and layout of the text for printing. A preview mode showed the formatted layout but Protext did not display the fonts on screen.
The macro record facility allowed a series of keystrokes to be 'learnt' and assigned to a single key or stored as an 'exec' file. For programmers, a useful feature is the easy manipulation of characters outside the alphanumeric range, in search strings or macros.
Protext may be used to write a webpage, generate a webpage from stored data, or to create text for export and final formatting to a WYSIWYG word processor or DTP desktop publishing programme.

The Becklin–Neugebauer Object (BN) is an object visible only in the infrared in the Orion Molecular Cloud. It was discovered in 1967 by Eric Becklin and Gerry Neugebauer during their near-infrared survey of the Orion Nebula.
The BN Object is thought to be an intermediate-mass protostar. It was the first star detected using infrared methods and is deeply embedded within the Orion star-forming nebula, where it is invisible at optical wavelengths because the light is completely scattered or absorbed due to the high density of dusty material.

United States Congress Joint Committee on Enrolled Bills

The Joint Committee on Enrolled Bills was a joint committee of the United States Congress operating from 1789 to 1876. It was one of the first standing committees established by Congress, having been created July 27, 1789 during the 1st Congress.
History.
The enrollment process dates to the first years of Congress, with procedures to ensure its integrity initially laid out in "Jefferson's Manual": "When a bill has passed both Houses of Congress, the House last acting on it notifies its passage to the other, and delivers the bill to the Joint Committee on Enrollment." From 1789 to 1876, the House and Senate had joint rules with similar requirements in relation to enrollment. In particular, these rules directed the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate to enroll bills and mandated a review (and any corrections, if necessary) by a joint committee, which would then report to the
respective chambers.
In 1876, the rules for the joint committee lapsed, and the Committee on Enrolled Bills reverted to separate House and Senate standing committees. The committee continued to be referred to as a "joint committee," even though both the House and Senate committees separately supervised the enrolling of bills originated in its own house. Under the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 the functions of the Committee on Enrolled Bills were incorporated into those of the House Administration Committee. This lasted until the beginning of the 107th Congress, when jurisdiction over enrollment was transferred to the House Clerk and laid out in House Rules. The Senate transferred authority over the enrollment process to the Secretary of the Senate in 1945 upon adoption of S.Res. 64 (79th Congress), and is now incorporated in Senate Rule XIV.
Jurisdiction.
The Joint Committee on Enrolled Bills was established with the responsibility for the enrollment of engrossed bills. The enacting resolution which created the committee stated:
After a bill shall have passed both Houses, it shall be duly enrolled on Parchment by the Clerk of the House of Representatives or the Secretary of the Senate, as the bill may have originated in one or the other House, before it shall be presented to the President of the United States. . . . When bills are enrolled they shall be examined by a joint committee for that purpose, who shall carefully compare the enrollment with the engrossed bills as passed in the two Houses, and, correcting any errors that may be discovered in the enrolled bills, make their report forthwith to their respective Houses.
An enrolled bill or resolution is the form of a measure finally agreed to by both chambers of Congress. This is different than an engrossed measure, which refers to the form a bill takes when it first passes its chamber of origin, including any amendments, before being referred to the second chamber for concurrence. Today, enrollment occurs in the chamber where the measure originated and is carried out by enrolling clerks under the supervision of the House Clerk and the Secretary of the Senate. Enrolled bills and joint resolutions are signed by the presiding officers of each chamber (or their designees), as required by , and are presented to the President by the House Clerk or Secretary of the Senate, depending on the chamber of origination.

Sue Duncan Children's Center

History.
Duncan started the center in 1961 after a friend at the Kenwood United Church of Christ asked her to teach Bible school to nine girls, ages 8 to 10, at the church and she discovered none of them could read. Over the years, the tutoring program has moved around to several different neighborhood churches and is now situated inside Jackie Robinson Elementary School in North Kenwood District.
Duncan faced troubles early on because of her novel position as a Caucasian starting an afterschool program in an almost completely African American community. During Arne Duncan's confirmation hearing to become Secretary of Education, he said:
"One of my earliest memories was in -- in -- I was about 6 years old, in 1970, the church that we were working out of was firebombed by the Blackstone Rangers. And I remember salvaging what we could from the church and walking down the block to another church and carrying crates of books and asking that -- that minister to allow us to come in and work, and having to deal with that.
Our lives were threatened. My mother's life was threatened. I remember leaving work one night and a guy coming by and saying if we came back the next day we'd be killed. And so we had an interesting conversation that -- that night at home at dinner. Our dinnertime conversations may be a little bit different than other families. And we tried to figure out what to do and really decided that you can't -- you can't run. And once you start running, you know, you'll be chancing your shadow eventually. So we showed up the next day and luckily he didn't." 
Duncan's three children, Arne, Sarah and Owen, spent much of their childhoods at the center. Other alumni of the center include Oscar nominee Michael Clarke Duncan, top IBM engineer Kerrie Holley, and award-winning martial artist Michelle Gordon.
Program overview.
The children's center provides academic help to primarily low-income African American children living on the South Side of Chicago. According to the center's website:
"SDCC further recognizes that the needs of its children are deeper than educational, that many have experienced and witnessed violence in their neighborhoods and homes leading to deep anger and subsequent behavioral problems.
The Center, through a range of programmatic components, aims to support the whole child, fostering academic achievement and emotional and social well being. To this end, the first part of the day is focused on academics with the children participating in small reading groups, intensive one-on-one tutoring, small group tutoring, and group discussions.
After all the children receive a warm nutritious meal, they participate in various activities focused more on social and emotional growth. SDCC provides violin lessons, a teenage girl's discussion group, weekly meditation aimed at teaching anger management techniques and Spanish class. SDCC also provides individual and group art therapy with a licensed Art Therapist weekly. The day ends with recreational activities in the gym."
Currently, the SDCC serves approximately 80 children, Monday through Friday from 2:30 p.m. until 6:30 p.m.

Art Style: AQUIA, known as Art Style: AQUITE in Europe and Art Style: AQUARIO in Japan, is a puzzle video game developed by skip Ltd. and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DSi's DSiWare digital distribution service. It is currently available in Japan, Australia, Europe, and North America. It was released at the launch of the Nintendo DSi and DSiWare service on April 5, 2009 in North America.
Gameplay.
The game requires players to line up blocks in rows of 3 or more in order to allow your diver to delve deeper into the ocean. This occurs as you move blocks of various sizes (1 x 2, 2 x 1, or 2 x 2) horizontally into a column of coloured blocks. As you move blocks in from one side, you push blocks out of the other side. You can move these blocks up and down the column, as well as rotating their colours configuration, in order to create matches of coloured blocks within the column.
As the diver progresses he'll slowly begin to lose his air supply. The player has to refill the diver's air-supply by clearing rows of blocks quicker or finding and clearing a row of 3 special blocks that will appear randomly as the game progresses. Darkness falls from the top of the screen as time goes on too, which makes it harder to make matches.
There are two modes to select from in the game, Timed Dive and Free Dive. Timed Dive requires you to clear blocks until the diver reaches a certain depth before he runs out of air, at that point the level will end and the diver descends to the next stage. Free Dive is a never-ending puzzle that tests how deep your diver can go before he runs out of air.
There is a relaxing Aquarium mode that when unlocked will display a virtual aquarium on the top screen.
Development.
"AQUARIO" was announced for the DSiWare service on October 2, 2008 at a Nintendo conference alongside the reveal of the service. It was eventually released on December 24, 2008 on the DSiWare's launch. It was announced for an English release in both North America and Europe alongside several other DSiWare games on February 18, 2009. It was developed by skip Ltd. and published by Nintendo.

National Center for Computational Sciences

The National Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS) is a United States Department of Energy Leadership Computing Facility. The NCCS provides resources for calculation and simulation in fields including astrophysics, materials, and climate research. This research is intended to enhance American competitiveness in industry.
The NCCS, founded in 1992 and located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), currently manages a 2.33-petaflop (theoretical peak) Cray XT5 supercomputer named Jaguar for use in open research by academic and corporate researchers. Jaguar was named the world's fastest computer at SC09, a position it held until October 2010.
Founded in 1992, the NCCS is a managed activity of the Advanced Scientific Computing Research program of the Department of Energy Office of Science (DOE-SC).
Systems.
Jaguar.
The petaflops Jaguar addresses some of the most challenging scientific problems in areas such as climate modeling, renewable energy, materials science, fusion, and combustion. Annually, 80% of Jaguar's resources are allocated through DOE's Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (INCITE) program, a competitively selected, peer reviewed process open to researchers from universities, industry, government, and non-profit organizations.
Through a close, four-year partnership between ORNL and Cray, Jaguar has delivered state-of-the-art computing capability to scientists and engineers from academia, national laboratories and industry. The XT system has grown in strength through a series of advances since being installed as a 25-teraflop XT3 in 2005. By early 2008 Jaguar was a 263-teraflop Cray XT4 able to solve some of the most challenging problems that could not be solved otherwise. In 2008 Jaguar was expanded with the addition of a 1.4-petaflop Cray XT5. The resulting system has over 224,000 processing cores (as of June 2010) using AMD's Opteron processors connected internally with Cray's Seastar2+ network. The XT4 and XT5 parts of Jaguar are combined into a single system using an InfiniBand network that links each piece to the Spider file system.
Jaguar is one of the most powerful computer systems for science with world-leading performance, more than three times the memory of any other computer (at the time of installation), and world-leading bandwidth to disks and networks. The AMD Opteron processor is a powerful, general purpose processor that uses the X86 instruction set which has a rich set of applications, compilers, and tools. Jaguar has hundreds of applications that have been ported and run on the Cray XT system, many of which have been scaled up to run on 25,000 to 150,000 cores.
From November 2009 until November 2010, Jaguar was the world's most powerful computer, according to TOP500, the semi-annual list of the world's top supercomputers.
HPSS.
The mass storage facility at ORNL currently consists of tape and disk storage components, Linux servers, and High Performance Storage System (HPSS) software. As of October 2010 more than 14 petabytes were stored in HPSS in more than 21 million files. 
Tape storage is provided by robotic tape libraries. The Sun StorageTek SL8500 libraries can each hold up to 10,000 cartridges and together house a total of thirteen 9840 drives (20 gigabyte cartridges, uncompressed), sixteen 9940B drives (200 gigabyte cartridges, uncompressed), thirty-two T10000A drives (500 gigabyte cartridges, uncompressed), and sixteen T10000B drives (1,000 gigabyte cartridges, uncompressed). The 9840 and 9940A drives read and write uncompressed data at 10 megabytes per second; the 9940B reads and writes at 30 megabytes per second. The beneficial feature of the 9840 tape technology is its fast seek time for small file access; these are the performance drives. The T10000 tape technology provides the ability to store a larger amount of data on each tape cartridge for more voluminous data sets; these are the capacity drives.
Eugene.
Eugene is a 27-teraflop/S IBM Blue Gene/P system. The system consists of 2048 850-megahertz IBM quad core 450d PowerPC processors and 2 gigabytes of memory per each node. Eugene has a front-end node for user logins and compiling of codes. Users submit their jobs from this front-end node and cannot directly login to a compute node. Eugene has 64 I/O nodes and each submitted job must use at least one I/O node, meaning that each job consumes a minimum of 32 nodes per execution.
Smoky.
Smoky is an NCCS development resource provided to users needing a comparable system to larger resources such as Jaguar for application development. Smoky’s current configuration is an 80 node Linux cluster consisting of four quad-core 2.0 gigahertz AMD Opteron processors per node, 32 gigabytes of memory (2 gigabytes per core), a gigabit Ethernet network with Infiniband interconnect, and access to Spider, the center's Lustre-based file system. The primary purpose of smoky is for application development, specifically application scaling development for petascale applications. Its programming environment mirrors the environment that is available on the Jaguar system. Only a limited number of NCCS users are allowed access to this resource.
Lens and EVEREST.
The visualization capabilities at the NCCS include a medium-sized visualization/data analysis cluster called Lens, a large PowerWall display called EVEREST, and a visualization laboratory.
Lens is a 32 node Linux cluster dedicated to data analysis and high-end visualization. Each node contains four quad-core 2.3 gigahertz AMD Opteron processors with 64 gigabytes of memory, and 2 NVIDIA 8800 GTX GPUs.
The primary purpose of lens is to enable data analysis and visualization of simulation data generated on jaguar so as to provide a conduit for large scale scientific discovery. Members of allocated jaguar projects will automatically be given accounts on lens. 
EVEREST (Exploratory Visualization Environment for REsearch in Science and Technology) is a large-scale venue for data exploration and analysis. EVEREST measures in at an impressive 30 feet long by 8 feet tall. Its main feature is a 27-projector PowerWall with an aggregate pixel count of 35 million pixels. The projectors are arranged in a 9×3 array, each providing 3,500 lumens for a very bright display. Displaying 11,520 by 3,072 pixels, or a total of 35 million pixels, the wall offers a tremendous amount of visual detail. The wall is integrated with the rest of the computing center, creating a high-bandwidth data path between large-scale high-performance computing and large-scale data visualization. EVEREST provides a premier data analysis and visualization capability and facility in the Department of Energy’s Office of Science.
EVEREST is controlled by a 14 node cluster. Each node contains four dual-core AMD Opteron processors. These 14 nodes have nVidia QuadroFX 3000G graphics cards connected to the projectors, providing a very-high-throughput visualization capability. Scientists can make use of the EVEREST facility by contacting any member of the visualization team and booking a time.
The visualization lab acts as an experimental facility for development of future visualization capabilities. It also serves as a staging area for technology to be deployed in EVEREST, staff offices, and conference rooms. It houses a 12-panel tiled LCD display, test cluster nodes, interaction devices, and video equipment.

Cretien van Campen

Cretien van Campen (born 24 January 1963) is a Dutch author, editor and scientific researcher in social science and fine arts. He is the founder of Synesthetics Netherlands and is affiliated with the Netherlands Institute for Social Research, and Windesheim University of Applied Sciences. He is best known for his work on synesthesia in art, including historical reviews of how artists have used synesthetic perceptions to produce art, and studies of perceived quality of life, in particular of how people with health problems perceive their living conditions in the context of health and social care services.
Author.
He is the author of the books “The Proust Effect” (2014), “The Hidden Sense” (2007), “Tussen zinnen” (Between Senses) (2005), “Beeldillusies” (Pictorial Illusions) (1994), and
“Gestalt van Goethe tot Gibson” (Gestalt from Goethe thru Gibson) (1994). In the last two books he explored the crossroads of artistic and scientific experiments with visual perception. From the mid-nineties he focussed on multisensory perception and synesthesia in art and science, resulting in the bestselling "Tussen zinnen" in the Netherlands and the internationally acclaimed "The Hidden Sense".
Editor.
Van Campen is editor of the Leonardo online bibliography Synesthesia in Art and Science and founder and web editor of Synesthetics Netherlands, a non-profit organization, hosting e.g. the Netherlands web community of synesthesia. He started editing during his studies as an editor of "Psychopolis", an academic magazine of theoretical psychology. After graduation, he compiled a series of bibliographies on health care for the Netherlands Institute of Primary Care (NIVEL). From 1994-2000 he was editor and later editor-in-chief of the scientific journal "Psychology & Maatschappij" (Psychology & Society), an interdisciplinary social scientific journal that was based in the critical psychology movement.
Scientific researcher.
He is affiliated with the Netherlands Institute for Social Research/SCP as a senior scientific researcher, the Windesheim University of Applied Sciences as an associate lector, and with Synesthetics Netherlands as an independent researcher and consultant. He obtained a M.A. in psychology with minors in philosophy and cultural studies, and a Ph.D. in history of art (and psychology) at Utrecht University, the Netherlands. During the past two decades he has been involved in two lines of research: perception and quality of life.
Fields of interest.
Perception.
In his Ph.D. study that resulted in the book "Gestalt from Goethe to Gibson" (1994), van Campen linked history of art to history of science. He showed that the apparent rise of Gestalt psychology in perception research in the 1910s had its roots in late 19th century art history in Germany. The study was done in the context of the interdisciplinary "Working Group Iconic Processes", including art historians, psychologists, physicists and anthropologists from several Dutch universities.
For a wider audience he wrote the book "Pictorial Illusions" (1994), exploring the links between artistic and scientific experiments with visual perception since the Renaissance. The book received attention from national television and art and science festivals.
After finishing his thesis, his interests moved to the perception of music. Soon after, he found the intriguing phenomenon of synesthesia on the crossroads of music and visual art. With artist and color expert Clara Froger, he started a series of experiments of synesthesia, combining scientific and artistic methods of investigation. The results were published nationally and internationally. The experiments became popular and got attention from hundreds of synesthetes in the Netherlands, mediated by articles and items in the Dutch media, which resulted in the Netherlands Web Community of Synesthesia and a number of workshops and conferences on synesthesia in art and science. The demand for information on synesthesia resulted in the book "Tussen zinnen". The new perspective on synesthesia, developed in this book in collaboration with synesthetes, artists and scientists in the Netherlands, led to the publication of "The Hidden Sense: Synesthesia in Art and Science" by the MIT Press. Since then, van Campen has been consulted on synesthesia and the senses in a number of national and international projects, among them Art Education Belgium (RASA), Unilever UK and Rabobank Netherlands. His research into synesthesia has taken the direction of autobiographical memory. In his latest book "The Proust Effect", he explores tales and studies on sense memories (e.g. the Madeleine story by Marcel Proust).
Quality of life.
In his work as an editor of bibliographies in health care, van Campen became acqainted with the research subject of quality of life, focussing on health and happiness. Since the early nineties, he participated in series of studies on quality of health care services from the patient’s perspective at the Netherlands Institute of Primary Health Care (NIVEL) and Maastricht University.
Later he participated in a number of studies into quality of care and quality of life in nursing homes, e.g. a collaborative study of the NIVEL institute and the Free University Amsterdam.
In 1998, he moved to the Netherlands Institute of Social Research (SCP), the national institute on well-being, where he broadened the scope from health and health care to citizen’s participation in work, leisure time activities and social activities. At SCP he published a series of research reports on the quality of life and participation of frail elderly and persons with physical disabilities.
Currently, van Campen pursues a research program into the competences of persons with disabilities in the research field of positive psychology.
Internationally, van Campen gave lectures on comparisons of quality of life in the Netherlands, Japan and South Korea.
His article with SCP-colleague Jurjen Ledema, "Are persons with physical disabilities who participate in society healthier and happier?" was nominated as outstanding scientific article of the year by the International Society for Quality of Life Research.
Since 2007 he is principal investigator of the research programme on elderly policy and well-being at the Netherlands Institute for Social Research. His latest publications are "Values on a Grey Scale: Elderly Policy Monitor 2008"., "Frail Older Persons in the Netherlands"., and "Steering on happiness".

Scary Chicken

Scary Chicken is a Buffalo, NY based band that was active from 1989-2002. 
Formation.
Formed at the University at Buffalo, the band recorded and released 4 CDs and 2 cassettes, and has had songs placed in multiple Motion Picture Soundtracks and National TV shows, most recently on Spike TV's "Top Dead Center" program.
Members.
The band members are: Tim Bryant (guitar, Vocals), Tom Greier (guitar, Vocals), Paul Zacks (bass), Dan "Scary" Braun (drums). Zacks had previously been a member of the Rochester, NY based band The Elephant Balls Experience.
Club scene.
Formed in 1989, Scary Chicken passed through the Buffalo college circuit and its growing club scene, to become one of the area’s most popular alternative bands. Scary Chicken played extensively in the eastern U.S. throughout the 90's, primarily between New York City, NY, Chicago, IL, Toronto, and Tennessee. 
Releases.
Scary Chicken released a series of self produced and released CDs, including Something Anymore and Flanny EP, before being discovered in 1994 at New York City’s Lion’s Den club by Cevin Soling of Xemu Records., 
Tours.
The band was the first to tour Hard Rock Cafe clubs from Boston, MA to Miami, FL, and has shared the stage with Weezer, Sloan, Beck, Ben Folds 5, Goo Goo Dolls, moe., Blue Rodeo and members of Moonboot Lover now playing as Soulive. The band was invited to play several large outdoor "EdgeFest" concerts, and was selected for Buffalo's Thursday at the Square concert series.
Press Excerpts.
From the Band's press kit:
The Hoya, Washington D.C. 9/27/96
"... Listening to "Is That Your Beer?" probably makes one wonder whether Scary Chicken's sound is amicable listening material for a night out dining with your loved ones. Many of the album's tracks contain hard guitar progressions that would probably sens plates flying off tables. 
For the Washington, D.C. show, however, they used an acoustic set that made the tracks come off much lighter. 
"The band opened the set with "If I Showered," which they released last month and should soon see time on major radio stations. 
The next song was "Can't Stop It," one of the songs that was written by Greier. This song, like most of those written by Greier on the album, is softer—more "chick rockish" according to Greier. The other songs on the album were written by Bryant who Greier says writes "witty and insane" pieces. 
"Some of Bryant's highlights include "Favorite Channel," a powerful, simultaneously poignant love song that was inspired by a remote control button, and "Road to Hell," which he wrote because of his father's favorite expression: "The road to Hell is paved with good intentions." 
"This tour shows that Scary Chicken will be playing for larger audiences in the very near future."
Democrat and Chronicle, Rochester, NY 6/27/96
"Prank calls and beer guzzling: It's all part of playing Chicken."
Artvoice Buffalo, NY 12/4/95
"For anyone who has seen Scary Chicken, you know that these guys are well humoured and quick-witted fellas that take what they can get, and laugh about it.
"The knack for songwriting that exists among Tim Bryant, Tom Greier, Paul Zacks, and Dan "Scary" Braun reaches mammoth proportions. This band has accomplished so much through its determination, hard work, and consistent practicing schedule, yet they aren’t getting the attention that the Goo Goo Dolls or Ani DiFranco have received.
"With two singers, Scary Chicken lays down sweet harmonies and rocking melodies over sometimes heavy guitar licks and interesting chord progressions. With songs like "Furburger", "Nuke The Whales", and "Tip Your Bartender" also included in Scary Chicken’s repertoire, the fun, cynicism, and wit sometimes catches you off guard. This is what makes the band great though: great music combined with fun, zanyness (Tim Bryant has been known to ask the audience if he can spit down someone’s throat for fifty cents!), mystery (Paul had his car - or should I say, "grocery-getter" - stolen right before Scary Chicken was to hit the stage at Broadway Joe’s a while back!), and atmosphere.
"As Scary Chicken is symbolic of the Buffalo Music scene, I have hopes and confidence that the chickens are on to bigger and better things. Many of their fans are die-hards and new people are always impressed.
The Buffalo News 6/16/95
Local Record Pick
"Is That Your Beer?" by Scary Chicken Buffalo band on Xemu Records, an independent label out of New York…The Chicken cooks with the jangling guitar rock on the opening cut, "If I Showered". The beat picks up on the hard driving "Cementhead". Scary Chicken adds a touch of country pop to "Can’t Stop It" and displays a tough edge on "Found". The group pounds away with power on "Locked Up". This album proves the band is ready for the big time with a national release."
Night-Life Magazine 6/5/95
"Scary Chicken, and 11-song CD called "Is That Your Beer?" with live introductions, occasional crow noise, an intermission and a secret 33rd track. 
"The spoken intros give the impression that this might have been recorded live in concert, an impression reinforced by the rawness of the sound. A check of the liner notes, however, reveals that all this seemingly messy spontaneity was actually laid down in a studio. Well, make that three studios.
"Scary Chicken has a marvelous sense of what makes a pop tune click. Everything they write seems to have a melody and a clever chorus."
Discography.
Compilations and others.
Scary Chicken is the backing band on all tracks on this record, including the acoustic version of Quiet Riot's "Metal Health" which Kevin Dubrow sings on.

IT cost transparency

IT cost transparency is a new category of information technology management software and systems that enables enterprise IT organizations to model and track the total cost to deliver and maintain the IT Services they provide to the business. It is increasingly a task of management accounting. IT cost transparency solutions integrate financial information such as labor, software licensing costs, hardware acquisition and depreciation, data center facilities charges, from general ledger systems and combines that with operational data from ticketing, monitoring, asset management, and project portfolio management systems to provide a single, integrated view of IT costs by service, department, GL line item and project. In addition to tracking cost elements, IT Cost Transparency tracks utilization, usage and operational performance metrics in order to provide a measure of value or ROI. Costs, budgets, performance metrics and changes to data points are tracked over time to identify trends and the impact of changes to underlying cost drivers in order to help managers address the key drivers in escalating IT costs and improve planning.
IT cost transparency combines elements of activity based costing, business intelligence, operational monitoring and performance dashboards. It provides the system on which to implement ITIL v3 Financial Management guidelines to assist with Financial Management for IT services and is closely related to IT Service Management.
Capabilities.
While specific solutions vary, capabilities can include:
Analysts' take.
"“Globalization, consumerization, new competitors and new service models are radically ‘changing the shape of IT’. IT leaders must develop greater transparency into the costs, utilization and operations of their IT services in order to optimize their IT investments and evolve from being technology managers to being stewards of business technology.”" -- [http://www.gartner.com/AnalystBiography?authorId=14850 Barbara Gomolski, Research Vice President, Gartner
""By making these costs transparent, the IT organization can fundamentally change the way business units consume IT resources, drive down total enterprise IT costs, and focus on IT spending that delivers real business value. The CIO who leads this change can usher in a new era of strategic IT management--and true partnership with the business."" [http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Unraveling_the_mystery_of_IT_costs_1651]—Andrew M. Appel, Neeru Arora, and Raymond Zenkich. McKinsey & Company.
" "Companies can get an understanding of the best candidates for virtualization or consolidation, for instance, and further reduce the cost of resources. IT organizations consistently try to become more efficient, and this type of detailed information enables visibility, billing and chargeback in the future," -- 
IT Cost Breakdown.
The average IT budget has the following breakdown:
This is confirmed by independent research from McKinsey and the Sand-Hill Group.
In addition to the considerations above about the current volume of software asset costs, even more important is their growth – their absolute growth (in EUR) and relative growth (relative to growth of other costs in the IT budget). Software asset costs are growing, endogenously and exogenously:

National LGBT Bar Association

The National Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Bar Association, formerly the National Lesbian and Gay Law Association, is a national association of lawyers, judges and other legal professionals, law students, activists, and affiliated lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender legal organizations. It was formally founded in 1989 and became an official affiliate of the American Bar Association in 1992. The association is headquartered in Washington, D.C. and its current executive director is D’Arcy Kemnitz.
Mission and Vision Statement.
The National LGBT Bar promotes justice in and through the legal profession for the LGBT community in all its diversity.
History of the Association.
The idea of creating a national lesbian and gay bar association was introduced at the 1987 march on Washington, D.C. for lesbian and gay rights. In 1989, at the American Bar Association (ABA) midyear meeting, bylaws for the association were presented and a nonprofit board of directors was formalized.
By the time the second board meeting was held in 1989 in Boston, the LGBT Bar had 293 paid members. At the meeting, the association initiated a campaign to ask the ABA to include protection based upon sexual orientation to its revision of the Model Code of Judicial Conduct for Judges, which has now been accepted by several states. 
In 1992, the LGBT Bar became an official affiliate of the American Bar Association and now works closely with the ABA's Section on Individual Rights and Responsibilities and its Committee on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity. 
In January 1995, the LGBT Bar became the first national organization to unanimously pass a board resolution calling for transgender inclusion in Employment Non-Discrimination Act.
Lavender Law Conference and Career Fair.
Each year, the National LGBT Bar Association hosts the Lavender Law® Conference and Career Fair to bring together legal professionals in the LGBT community. The three-day conference draws over 1,600 attendees and features over 40 workshops and panel discussions as well as plenary sessions, receptions for women and people of color, and other opportunities for attendees to earn continuing legal education (CLE) credits. The career fair, held on the first day of the conference, draws over 500 students and features over 130 recruiters. 
Awards Given Out by the Association.
The Dan Bradley Award
The Dan Bradley Award is the National LGBT Bar Association's highest honor. It recognizes the efforts of a member of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender legal community whose work, like Attorney Dan Bradley's, has led the way in our struggle for equality under the law. Dan Bradley was the first chair of the American Bar Association Section of Individual Rights and Responsibility's Committee on the Rights of Gay People, now known as the Committee for Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity. Bradley saw the law as a powerful instrument of social justice, and he believed that lawyers had an obligation to place their skills as advocates at the service of the least powerful among us.

POGIL

POGIL (Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning) is a pedagogical method devised to teach process skills (such as collaboration and written expression) as well as content using an inquiry-based learning approach. It was originally devised by professors at Franklin and Marshall College and the State University of New York, Stony Brook for use in teaching general chemistry, but the structure of POGIL is broadly applicable in all subjects.
POGIL Activities.
A typical POGIL activity begins with a piece of data. For example, this data could be a graph, a map, or an image. The students are then given questions that force them to explore the data. These questions eventually lead students to generating a conclusion based on the data. Students then apply this conclusion in new situations. Thus, POGIL activities follow the structure of the learning cycle of exploration, concept invention and application, and has a strong basis in constructivism.
Classroom implementation.
In a POGIL classroom, students work together in groups of 3 or 4. Each student is assigned a role, such as manager, recorder, spokesperson or reflector. The students work together on activities that are structured to help them build up a concept. The students are expected to reach a consensus answer to each question on the activity, then be able to communicate that answer in written or oral form. This group structure creates positive interdependence among the students, reinforcing involvement and learning for each student
The POGIL Project.
The teaching method of POGIL is supported by an organization known as the POGIL Project. The POGIL Project is the recipient of many grants from the National Science Foundation and other sources. The goals of the POGIL Project are to encourage the dissemination and implementation of POGIL, evaluate the impact of POGIL on student learning, and create structure to continue these goals beyond the lifetime of the NSF funding.

Stargazer (aircraft)

Stargazer, registration number N140SC, is a modified Lockheed L-1011 TriStar aircraft used by Orbital Sciences Corporation as a mother ship launch pad for Pegasus rockets. , 35 rockets have been launched from it, using the Pegasus-H and Pegasus-XL configurations.
History.
The first Pegasus launch to use "Stargazer" was conducted on 27 June 1994, and was the maiden flight of the Pegasus-XL. Previous launches used the NASA-operated Boeing NB-52B "Balls 8", which was also used for four subsequent launches, as the original Pegasus could not be launched from "Stargazer" due to clearance issues. A modified version, the Pegasus-H, was introduced to rectify this.
In addition to Pegasus launches, "Stargazer" was used for captive tests and transportation of the X-34 hypersonic research aircraft; however, drop tests used "Balls 8". Orbital Sciences also offer the aircraft for research flights. It is capable of carrying a payload to an altitude of .
Pegasus launches using "Stargazer" are usually conducted from Vandenberg Air Force Base. However, launches have also been conducted from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Wallops Flight Facility, and from launch sites outside the United States: Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands and Gando Airport in Spain.

<doc id="21626270" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21626270" title="St. Xavier's, Gandhinagar">
St. Xavier's, Gandhinagar

St. Xavier's School, Gandhinagar, began in the year 1970, at the invitation of the Government of Gujarat. It began as a joint venture with Mt. Carmel school, Gandhinagar and hence was aptly named Xavier's-Carmel. The school was situated in Sector 20 initially and then land was allotted to the management to develop an independent building in Sector 8. Rev. Fr. Charles Gomes, S.J. was the first Principal who had a vision to develop a good Catholic school in the new capital city of Gujarat. He was followed by other highly qualified educationists, Fr. Ignatius Pinto, S.J. and Fr. Freddy D'Souza, S.J. who shifted the school building to the new site in Sector 8. Hence in 1982, the school began with a few classes shifting to the new building in Sector 8 and in a couple of years it was a totally independent building named St. Xavier's School. Fr. Godfrey de Rozario, S.J. later on developed the campus and planted plenty of trees to give it a green environment friendly appearance. He was assisted by Br. Gomez, S.J. who helped maintain the campus.
Background.
Xavier's stands for 'excellence'- that is excellence in academics, sports, co-curricular activities and so on. The all- round growth of a student is focused upon - intellectual growth, emotional growth, spiritual growth and physical growth.
A Xavierite is a person for others which is manifested in his/her contribution to society through social work and various outreach programmes. St. Xavier's School caters to the children of Gandhinagar who mostly comprise children of Government officials working in Sachivalaya. It follows the Gujarat State Board syllabus and has both the mediums running in the school - English and Gujarati.
In the year 1996/1997 the Vedruna Sisters(Carmelites of Charity) joined the school to look after the Primary and the Pre-Primary sections with Sr. Mary D'Cruz being the first Sister in charge of the Primary section.
The school has been doing academically well and has always secured more than 95% results at the Board examinations. The High point of the school is its strong focus on co-curricular activities with an annual athletic meet and an annual day programme together with various other tournaments in football, cricket, basketball and skating besides the annual Quest festival and other inter-class competitions run throughout the year. This helps to develop the personality of the student and prepares him/her to face the world with confidence.
The motto of the school in Latin is Ateneris Impende Laborem which when translated means that a child from an early age should apply himself/herself to hard work. Xavier's believes in hard work, but it also stresses that all work and no play is not the solution to a healthy upbringing. Hence work goes hand in hand with activities, be it on the play field or in the class room or in the street
History.
St. Xavier's School, Gandhinagar belongs to the International Xavier's family having institutions of learning, worldwide. It is run by the Society of Jesus, an order of religious Priests and Brothers whose main house is based in Rome. The Jesuits, as these Fathers and Brothers are known were the School Masters of Europe because of their educational institutions which stressed Excellence. They stressed Science and the liberal Arts. St. Francis Xavier whose uncorrupted body lies in Goa was the first Jesuit to come to India 450 years ago and he began the first Jesuit institutions in our country. Since then the number of Jesuit schools, colleges, management institutions have grown and are spread all over India.
The Jesuits used the Ratio Studiorium as their methodology to run educational institutions and it is still being followed in many institutions even today.
Since the government of Gujarat had planned to shift the new capital to Gandhinagar in the late 60s, they had to shift the bureaucrats to the new capital too. Most of the bureaucrats had their children in St. Xavier's Loyola Hall, Ahmedabad or in Mt. Carmel, Ahmedabad, Hence the Government invited the Fathers and the Sisters to start their respective institutions in the new capital and that is how St. Xavier's Gandhinagar came into existence. From a government building in Sector 20, it has shifted to a sprawling campus with football fields, a cricket ground, two basketball courts, a full sized skating rink, a canteen having all delicious foods liked by kids and a campus that is green and environment friendly, all in Sector 8.
The students come from all strata of society and the school is affiliated to the Gujarat Secondary Board of education running both Gujarati and English medium streams. The High school and the higher secondary receive a salary grant from the government and hence the fees are nominal making it possible to admit students from all possible economic backgrounds. The school also provides free-ships and scholarships to the students.

Lyssa Chapman

Lyssa Rae Chapman (born June 10, 1987), more commonly known as "Baby Lyssa", is an American bail bondswoman and bounty hunter, most noted for her role on A&E TV's "Dog the Bounty Hunter", in which she, along with her father Duane "Dog" Chapman and various friends and family, track down and capture wanted fugitives.
Personal life and career.
Lyssa Rae Chapman was born the tenth child of Duane "Dog" Chapman and his third wife, Lyssa Rae Brittain (née Greene). Lyssa was raised by her father until she was 10, after which she went to live with her mother in a small Alaskan town, and had no contact with her father for six years. Lyssa worked for her father, Duane "Dog" Chapman, at their family's bail bonds company, Da Kine Bail Bonds. She no longer works with her family and will not be on their new show. 
Lyssa's first daughter, Abbie Mae Chapman (born June 11, 2002), was born the day after Lyssa's fifteenth birthday. It was revealed in an interview during Lyssa's second pregnancy, that Abbie's father had been twenty-four at the time of conception. He was subsequently arrested and went to jail for sexually abusing a minor.
On February 20, 2009, Lyssa married Brahman "Bo" Galanti (born July 24, 1973) at "Lanikuhonua at Ko Olina" in Oahu, Hawaii. Along with Lyssa's daughter Abbie and Bo's daughter Serena, the couple have one child together, Madalynn Grace Galanti (born August 7, 2009). In February 2011, Lyssa filed for divorce from Galanti. On March 15, 2011, Lyssa was arrested for criminal property damage and assaulting a police officer.
Howard Books, a division of Simon & Schuster, released Chapman's autobiography, "Walking on Eggshells: Discovering Strength and Courage Amid Chaos", on May 7, 2013. The book was co-authored by Lisa Wysocky.

American Book Review

The American Book Review is a nonprofit, internationally distributed publication that appears six times a year. "ABR" specializes in reviews of frequently neglected published works of fiction, poetry, and literary and cultural criticism from small, regional, university, ethnic, avant-garde, and women's presses. "ABR" as a literary journal aims to project the sense of engagement that writers feel about what is being published. It is edited and produced by writers for writers and the general public and is housed at the University of Houston–Victoria. The online content of "ABR" is distributed by Project MUSE.
History.
Ronald Sukenick founded the "American Book Review" in 1977. "ABR" was one of the first literary journals entirely devoted to reviewing works from independent presses and continues to follow that tradition today.
The "American Book Review" was designed to offer a unique model for reviewing books, one edited by writers themselves in an effort to reproduce the interest they took in their peers’ works of fiction, poetry, and criticism. This collective approach remained intact while responsibility for producing the journal was assumed by the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1987, then by Illinois State University in 1995, and now by the University of Houston–Victoria.
In November 2006, the editorial aspects of "ABR" moved from Illinois State University to the University of Houston–Victoria (UHV) under the editorship of Dr. Jeffrey R. Di Leo, Editor and Publisher of "ABR" and UHV's Dean of the School of Arts and Sciences. The production elements of "ABR" were also transferred in September 2007, making UHV the "American Book Review"’s single host.

Wake Up Call (Phil Collins song)

"Wake Up Call" is a double A-side 2003 single release by English singer Phil Collins from his seventh solo album "Testify", released in 2002. The song was released in a double A-side format alongside "The Least You Can Do".
The music video made for "Wake Up Call", showed Collins waking early and going around Switzerland giving a wake-up call to local residents. Before long a crowd soon gathers to follow him and start to pester him with questions, of which the last question asked inquires about a possible Genesis reunion, in which Collins shakes his head and makes a funny face at the camera. However, he did re-unite with Mike and Tony in 2007 for .
The song failed to make a huge impact on the charts, suffering from the poor reception "Testify" received upon release.

History of the Goddard Space Flight Center

Goddard Space Flight Center is NASA's first, and oldest, space center. It is named after Dr. Robert H. Goddard, the father of modern rocketry. Throughout its history, the center has managed, developed, and operated many notable missions, including the Cosmic Background Explorer, the Hubble Space Telescope, the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS), the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, and the Solar Dynamics Observatory.
Origin of GSFC.
On July 29, 1958, President Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, establishing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. When it began operations on October 1, 1958, NASA consisted mainly of the four laboratories and some 80 employees of the government's 46-year-old research agency, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA).
GSFC was established on May 1, 1959 as NASA's first space flight center.
Its original charter was to perform five major functions on behalf of NASA: technology development and fabrication, planning, scientific research, technical operations, and project management. Even today, the Center is organized into several Directorates, each charged with one of these key functions.
Role of GSFC.
Until May 1, 1959, NASA's presence in Greenbelt, Maryland was known as the Beltsville Space Center. It was then renamed the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), after Dr. Robert H. Goddard, the father of modern rocketry. Its first 157 employees transferred from the United States Navy's Project Vanguard missile program, but continued their work at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C. while the Center was under construction.
On August 1, 1958, Senator J. Glenn Beall of Maryland announced in a press release that the new "outer space agency" (NASA) would establish a laboratory and plant at Greenbelt, Maryland. This was the first time public notice was drawn to what was to become Goddard Space Flight Center. Planning of the new Center continued through the rest of 1958 and by the end of the year events were ripening.
History.
1959: The first year.
On January 15, 1959, by action of the NASA Administrator, four divisions (Construction Division, Space Sciences Division, Theoretical Division, and the Vanguard Division) of NASA were designated as the new Beltsville Space Center. In a meeting held on February 12, 1959, for the purpose of surveying the organization and functions of the Beltsville Space Center, it was generally agreed that the Center probably would perform five major interrelated space science functions on behalf of NASA: Project Management, Research, Development and fabrication, Advanced planning, and Operations. On May 1, 1959, Dr. T. Keith Glennan, NASA Administrator, in a public release, formally announced that the Beltsville Space Center would be re-designated the Goddard Space Flight Center "in commemoration of Dr. Robert H. Goddard, American pioneer in rocket research." In May 1959, Leopold Winkler, who had transferred to NASA with the Vanguard program, was appointed Chief, Technical Services for Goddard. And in September 1959, Dr. Harry J. Goett was named Director of Goddard Space Flight Center. Goett came from Ames Research Center, where he had been Chief of the Full Scale and Flight Research Division.
On April 24, 1959, construction of the new space laboratory began on a site located on a 550-acre tract formerly part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Center at Beltsville, Maryland. By September 1960, Building 1 was fully occupied and other buildings were well underway. Although much of the occupancy was on a temporary basis and the personnel complement was widely scattered from Anacostia, D.C., to Silver Spring, Maryland, and points between, the Goddard Space Flight Center had become a physical reality.
1960 - 1969.
Goddard Space Flight Center contributed to Project Mercury, America's first manned space flight program. The Center assumed a lead role for the project in its early days and managed the first 250 employees involved in the effort, who were stationed at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. However, the size and scope of Project Mercury soon prompted NASA to build a new "Manned Spacecraft Center", now the Johnson Space Center, in Houston, Texas. Project Mercury's personnel and activities were transferred there in 1961.
During the early manned space flight years, including the missions of Project Mercury, Project Gemini and the Apollo program, GSFC was responsible for the management and operations of the communication networks. In 1961, Goddard tracking and data engineers were given responsibility for designing and managing the Mercury Space Flight Network (MSFN), the first consolidated communication network to support manned space flight. Later, GSFC was responsible for the design, management, and operation of the Manned Space Flight Network (MSFN), Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network (STADAN), and finally the Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network (STDN).
In April 1962, NASA launched Ariel 1 - a joint effort between Goddard and the United Kingdom and the first international satellite. Researchers in the U.K. developed the instruments for the satellite, and Goddard managed development of the satellite and the overall project.
1970 - 1979.
The ending of the Apollo program brought a new era to Goddard. The drive to the Moon had unified NASA and garnered tremendous support for space efforts from Congress and the country in general. But once that goal was achieved, NASA's role, mission and funding became a little less clear. In some ways, Goddard's focus on scientific missions and a diversity of projects helped protect it from some of the cutbacks that accompanied the end of the Apollo program in 1972. Yet despite the cutbacks, the work at Goddard was still expanding into new areas, such as technology development and leveraging satellites to take advantage of the Space Shuttle.
1980 - 1989.
Goddard Space Flight Center remained involved in the manned space flight program, providing computer support and radar tracking of flights through a worldwide network of ground stations called the Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network (STDN). However, the Center focused primarily on designing unmanned satellites and spacecraft for scientific research missions. Goddard pioneered several fields of spacecraft development, including modular spacecraft design, which reduced costs and made it possible to repair satellites in orbit. Goddard's Solar Max satellite, launched in 1980, was repaired by astronauts on the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1984.
1990 - 1999.
The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, remains in service and continues to grow in capability thanks to its modular design and multiple servicing missions by the Space Shuttle. Early this decade, another mission Goddard managed, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory launched, which observed 2,700 gammy ray-bursts and definitively showed that the majority of gamma-ray bursts must originate in distant galaxies and therefore must be enormously energetic. A quote from the official history of Goddard states:
2000 - present.
Today, the Center remains involved in each of NASA's key programs. Goddard has developed more instruments for planetary exploration than any other organization, among them scientific instruments sent to every planet in the Solar System. The Center's contribution to the Earth Science Enterprise includes several spacecraft in the Earth Observing System fleet as well as EOSDIS, a science data collection, processing, and distribution system. For the manned space flight program, Goddard develops tools for use by astronauts during extra-vehicular activity, and built and operates the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Solar Dynamics Observatory.

USS Howick Hall (ID-1303)

USS "Howick Hall" (ID-1303) was a cargo ship that served in the United States Navy from 1918 to 1919.
Construction and service, 1910-1918.
"Howick Hall" was built as the commercial cargo ship SS "Howick Hall" in 1910 at Port Glasgow, Scotland, by the William Hamilton Company. In 1914 she was sold to the United States Steel Products Company of New York City. She was sold to the Isthmian Line in 1915.
In September 1917, the United States Army acquired "Howick Hall" for use as a cargo ship during World War I.
United States Navy service, 1918-1919.
The U.S. Navy acquired "Howick Hall" from the U.S. Army on 24 August 1918. Assigned Identification Number (Id. No.) 1303, she was commissioned at Baltimore, Maryland, the same day as USS "Howick Hall" with Lieutenant Commander Gust E. Jonsson in command.
Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, "Howick Hall" loaded cargo at Baltimore and joined a convoy at New York City. From there she steamed to St. Nazaire, France, which she reached on 30 September 1918. She discharged her cargo and returned to Baltimore, where she arrived on 31 October 1918. It proved to be her only wartime voyage in U.S. Navy service, as World War I ended on 11 November 1918 before she next put to sea.
"Howick Hall"s second and final voyage in U.S. Navy service began at Newport News, Virginia, where she loaded cargo for Le Verdon-sur-Mer, France, on 25 December 1918. From there "Howick Hall" went to Bassens for fuel, and on 3 February 1919 departed for the United States. However, a case of spinal meningitis in her crew necessitated her stopping at Bermuda on 21 February 1919. Ship and crew were placed in quarantine and denied communication with the island of Bermuda until she departed for Newport News on 25 February 1919.
After calling at Newport News, "Howick Hall" arrived at Baltimore on 5 March 1919 and decommissioned there on 13 March 1919. She was returned to her former owners the same day.
Commercial service, 1919-1942.
Once again SS "Howick Hall", she returned to commercial service. She was renamed SS "Doverden" in 1929, then sold in 1930 to the Exeter Shipping Company of London, England. In 1931 she was sold to the McAllum Steamship Company of London, then in 1932 to the Lambert Brothers of London, then again in 1935 to H. Constant of London.
"Doverden" was sold for scrap in 1935, but was saved from scrapping when Ditta Luigi Pittaluga Vapori of Genoa, Italy, purchased her and placed her in service as the Italian commercial cargo ship SS "Ircania". In 1937 she was sold to the S.A. Cooperativa di Nav Garibaldi of Genoa, and served as an Italian supply ship in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War of 1935-1936.
The U.S. Maritime Commission acquired "Ircania" on 24 June 1941 at Jacksonville, Florida, and renamed her SS "Raceland". The Maritime Commission transferred "Raceland" to the South Atlantic Line on 31 December 1941. In South Atlantic Line service early in World War II, "Raceland" joined Convoy PQ-13, which departed Boston, Massachusetts, for Reykjavík, Iceland, and then continued to Murmansk in the northern Soviet Union.
Loss.
"Raceland" was in Convoy PQ-13 on the Reykjavík-Murmansk leg of its voyage when she was bombed and sunk by German bombers south of Bear Island on 28 March 1942 at position 72° 40' N., 20° 20' E. Two of four lifeboats her crew launched were lost in heavy seas. The remaining two finally reached the coast of Norway, after constant rowing, with 22 men dead from the cold.

Mongolia national football team results

This article details the fixtures and results of the Mongolia national football team. The Mongolian national football team represents the republic of Mongolia in international football under the Mongolian Football Federation. Founded in 1959 the association was inactive between 1960 and 1998 when the team did not feature in any international fixtures. From the few games played since 1998, Mongolians have won only nine games played against five different nations within the AFC (four against Guam, two against Macau and one each against Myanmar, Northern Mariana Islands and the Philippines). They are also one of only two FIFA affiliated teams (the other being American Samoa) to have ever lost to Guam. The Mongolian Football Federation is in the Asian Football Confederation and the East Asian Football Federation.
Currently, the presence of so-called "Legioners" in Mongolian teams is commonplace in other teams of players from Nigeria, Brazil, Canada, Singapore and South Korea. As a result of the Asian Champions League, Mongolia not qualified for the group stage goals, missed the last minute of the final match. In club competition draws never been able to get through to the second round of the Asian Cup. Last year, the President of Mongolia Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj met with FIFA President Sepp Blatter, who noted the progress of the Mongolian football players. He said that he knows that Mongolia is not easy to play football, as most of the year, the country remains cool weather. But despite this, he is satisfied the growing interest of Mongolian kids and youth football in recent years.
Now the country is actively build football stadiums and open children's sections, coaches and referees are trained to FIFA. The success of the youth teams from Mongolia said the fifth 14-year-old Mongolian players at the prestigious international tournament Gothia cup in Sweden. The head of "Erchim" klub Badnasan said, that today's 10-year-olds will play in the future better than the legionaries.

Hamilton Nationals

The Hamilton Nationals were a Major League Lacrosse (MLL) professional men's field lacrosse team based in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. They began play in the 2009 season in Toronto, Ontario as the Toronto Nationals, becoming the first-ever Canadian team in MLL history. In 2009, they played their home games at BMO Field, which is also home to Major League Soccer's Toronto FC but moved to the smaller Lamport Stadium for the 2010 season. On February 3, 2011, the Nationals announced that they were relocating to Hamilton, Ontario, and would play their home games at Ron Joyce Stadium on the campus of McMaster University. On 21 November 2013, MLL announced that the team would not participate in the 2014 season, with most of the players being transferred to the expansion Florida Launch.
The Hamilton Nationals' identity represented both the Canadian and Iroquois communities. The team's logo incorporated the Canadian maple leaf and the Iroquois Five Nations belt pattern taken from each respective flag. Additionally, the Nationals continuously signed Iroquois players.
Franchise history.
The Nationals had their roots in the MLL's charter franchise the Rochester Rattlers. Before the 2009 season, part of the Rattlers' roster was transferred to the new Nationals' team; however, the name, colours, and history stayed behind in Rochester to be potentially used by a future MLL team. In November 2010, it was reported that the Chicago Machine had moved to Rochester, NY and resumed operation of the Rattlers franchise.
The Nationals started play in the MLL on May 15, 2009 and won against Washington Bayhawks 17-16. They won their first home game over the Chicago Machine 15-11. The Nationals qualified for the playoffs as the second seed with a 7-5 record and the best offense in MLL with 184 goals for. The Nationals played their first playoff game against the Long Island Lizards at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland. Toronto won their semi-final matchup 14-13 thanks to a strong game by Merrick Thomson scoring 4 goals. Toronto (at the time) went on to face the Denver Outlaws in the Steinfeld Cup Final. The Nationals were tied with the Outlaws 9-9 with over a minute to go in the game. Nationals head coach Dave Huntley called a time-out to draw out a strategy. With 45 seconds left to go, Joe Walters passed to Shawn Williams and Williams scored the winning goal to give the Toronto Nationals their first championship victory 10-9 over the Denver Outlaws. Merrick Thomson was named Playoff MVP and Brodie Merrill won the Major League Lacrosse Defensive player of the Year Award.
On February 3, 2011, the Nationals announced that they would be moving to Hamilton and would be known as the Hamilton Nationals. It was also announced that Arrow Express Sports would take sole ownership of the team and the team would play their home games at Ron Joyce Stadium on the campus of McMaster University. Jody Gage was announced as the new general manager for the team, while Regy Thorpe was named the new head coach.
On 21 November 2013, the MLL announced that the team would not participate in the 2014 season, with most of the players being transferred to the expansion Florida Launch. The team is expected to attempt to rejoin the league for the 2015 season once construction of the new Tim Hortons Field in Hamilton is completed, much like the Rochester Rattlers did for the 2011 season.

Sisira Jayasuriya

Sisira Jayasuriya, is a Professor of Economics at Monash University, Melbourne. His research and policy advisory activities cover trade, macroeconomic, environmental and food policy issues in developing countries, with a focus on Asia. He has published widely on natural disaster, food security and food safety issues, trade and WTO rules, foreign investment, soil erosion and environmental problems, macroeconomic and exchange rate policies in Sri Lanka and Tsunami reconstruction. 
He is also an internationally known scholar of the political economy of developing countries and has published several widely cited scholarly articles on the Sri Lankan conflict in journals such as World Development, Oxford Development Studies and the Economic and Political Weekly.
Professor Jayasuriya is an ethnic Sinhalese from Sri Lanka. In January 2009, he was interviewed by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on the ongoing Sri Lankan Civil War. This interview generated a campaign of abuse, threats (including death threats) and vilification by extremist Sinhalese groups who wanted to cover up the war crimes committed by the military and the government, including an unsuccessful attempt to intimidate his university to silence him. Professor Jayasuriya was accused of supporting the LTTE terror because he highlighted the roots of the Sri Lankan conflict in the discrimination practised against Tamils in Sri Lanka for decades; his prediction of large scale civilian casualties are now well documented by UN and other independent sources.

Balthasar H. Meyer

Balthasar Henry Meyer (May 28, 1866 – February 9, 1954) was an American government official and professor of economics and sociology. He served for 28 years as a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission.
Early life.
Meyer was born near Mequon, Wisconsin, the son of Henry and Louise (Wiepking) Meyer. He attended Oshkosh State Normal School, receiving his bachelor's degree, and then took two degrees, including his doctorate in 1897, from the University of Wisconsin, after doing graduate work at the University of Berlin in 1894–95.
He taught school, 1884-1886. He was principal of the Fredonia, Wisconsin, schools from 1887-1889. He was principal of the high school at Port Washington, Wisconsin, 1889-1892. After receiving his degrees, he stayed on in Madison to be a sociology instructor. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1899, and to full professor of political economy in 1900. While there, he taught what was believed to be the first course in insurance in the United States. He married Alice Elizabeth Carlton of Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, on August 29, 1901.
Government official.
In 1905, he took leave from his professorship to become a member of the Wisconsin Railroad Commission, and then, in 1907, became its chairman. In 1910, President William Howard Taft appointed him to the U.S. Railroad Security Commission. In 1910, Taft appointed him to the Interstate Commerce Commission. Confirmed by the Senate on December 21, 1910, he took the oath of office on December 31, 1910. Meyer was thereafter appointed to successive terms by Presidents Wilson, Coolidge, Hoover, and Franklin Roosevelt. Following his 1939 retirement, he served as a consultant and mediator for the transportation industry.
Meyer also gave attention to improving the ICC's internal capabilities. Meyer and his ally, fellow Commissioner Franklin K. Lane, supported increasing the Commission's ability to compute marginal rates, and the Commission engaged noted economist Max O. Lorenz (inventor of the Lorenz curve) for this task.
In 1937, Meyer was attacked by Senator Harry S. Truman for allegedly giving a railroad attorney information about a 1932 Commission decision before it was publicly released. Meyer explained that while he had no recollection of the specific case, it was routine in uncontested cases such as this to give information to the applicant without waiting for a formal decision.
While Meyer's fourth and final term expired in 1938, he continued to serve until the following year pending Senate confirmation of a replacement. President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Representative Thomas R. Amlie. The Amlie nomination proved contentious and was withdrawn, and Meyer, wishing to retire, resigned on May 1, 1939.
Meyers wrote several books about the transportation industry, including "Railroad Legislation in the United States" (1903) and "History of Transportation in the United States before 1860" (1917).
He was a member of the American Economic Association, the American Academy of Political and Social Science, the Wisconsin Academy of Letters Arts and Sciences, the Wisconsin Educational Round Table, the Wisconsin Teachers' Association, the Press Club of the University of Wisconsin, and the Wisconsin Historical Society.

Fred Winter Juvenile Novices' Handicap Hurdle

The Fred Winter Juvenile Novices' Handicap Hurdle is a Grade 3 National Hunt hurdle race in Great Britain which is open to horses aged four years. It is run on the Old Course at Cheltenham over a distance of about 2 miles and 110 yards (3,319 metres), and during its running there are eight hurdles to be jumped. It is a handicap race for novice hurdlers, and it is scheduled to take place each year during the Cheltenham Festival in March.
The event is named in memory of Fred Winter (1926–2004), who was successful as both a jockey and a trainer in National Hunt racing. Winter's record at the Cheltenham Festival included seventeen victories as a jockey, and twenty-eight as a trainer.
The Fred Winter Juvenile Hurdle was one of several new races introduced at the Festival when a fourth day was added to the meeting in 2005. It was initially classed at Listed level, and it was promoted to Grade 3 status in 2009.

Jack Silver

Jack Howard Silver (born 23 April 1942) is a set theorist and logician at the University of California, Berkeley. He has made several deep contributions to set theory. In his 1975 paper "On the Singular Cardinals Problem", Silver proved that if κ is singular with uncountable cofinality and 2λ = λ+ for all infinite cardinals λ < κ, then 2κ = κ+. Prior to Silver's proof, many mathematicians believed that a forcing argument would yield that the negation of the theorem is consistent with ZFC. He introduced the notion of master condition, which became an important tool in forcing proofs involving large cardinals. Silver proved the consistency of Chang's conjecture using the Silver collapse (which is a variation of the Levy collapse). He proved that, assuming the consistency of a supercompact cardinal, it is possible to construct a model where 2κ=κ++ holds for some measurable cardinal κ. With the introduction of the so-called Silver machines he was able to give a fine structure free proof of Jensen's covering lemma. He is also credited with discovering Silver indiscernibles and generalizing the notion of a Kurepa tree (called Silver's Principle). He discovered 0# in his 1966 Ph.D. thesis, and the thesis is the main topic of the widely used graduate textbook "Set Theory: An Introduction to Large Cardinals" by Frank R. Drake. He earned his Ph.D. in Mathematics at Berkeley in 1966 under Robert Vaught. Silver's original work involving large cardinals was perhaps motivated by the goal of showing the inconsistency of an uncountable measurable cardinal; instead he was led to discover indiscernibles in L assuming a measurable cardinal exists.

Woh Chokri

Woh Chokri (1994) (; ) is an Indian movie directed by Subhankar Ghosh and stars Pallavi Joshi, Neena Gupta, Paresh Rawal and Om Puri. Film won 3 National Film Awards. Pallavi Joshi won National Film Award – Special Jury Award whereas Paresh Rawal won the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor and Neena Gupta that of the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actress for this movie.
Plot.
Geeta Devi (Neena Gupta) is one of the daughters-in-law of a prominent and wealthy family, who is unfortunately widowed. Still youthful and attractive, she gives in to the wiles of one of the men in the neighbourhood, Lalit Ramji (Paresh Rawal), and starts living with him. She has a daughter, Apsara (Pallavi Joshi) by him, and the three are portrayed as a happy family unit. 
One day, Lalit disappears without explanation, and from then on, the lives of the abandoned mother and daughter go steadily downward. Apsara is forced to leave school through her erstwhile in-laws' machinations; with no income, their landlord is forced to let them go, and they have to move to a hutment colony, Geeta begins work as a maidservant in order to earn a living and support her daughter. One of the poignant themes in the movie is Apsara's relationship with her father, to whose illusory love she hangs on with a childlike and, in the end, horribly unjustified faith. 
Learning that Lalit is now a successful politician, Apsara persuades her mother to travel to New Delhi to meet him as she is sure her father will rescue them from their terrible condition. Rejected, the mother returns, and having lost all hope and faith in human goodness, takes to drink. Soon after, she dies leaving her daughter aged 16 all alone.
The daughter takes up her mother's job as maidservant in the house of a widower (Om Puri) of 15 years. He seems genuinely concerned for the welfare of the girl and slowly gains her trust and finally asks her to come live with him despite the age gap. After some initial reluctance, the girl finally accepts and starts living with Om Puri, and briefly the young girl is restored to a secure life free of want. Her protector, then dies of a heart attack. His relatives accuse the girl of murder and she is taken into custody and questioned by the police. After a few months she is released for lack of evidence. Left to her own devices, she works for a time as a prostitute until she decides to move to Delhi and try to get in touch with her father.
In Delhi, she lives in the railway station with three other street children, even acquiring a status of leadership among them. One day, she learns that her father is coming to the city and will be giving a conference. She decides to attend and during the conference, she gets up and starts shouting to her father that she is his daughter. Lalit ignores her calls and she is led out by the police and left a few miles down the road.
She then realizes that her mother was right and that her father had really abandoned them to their fate. Faced with the treacherous cruelty that life can show, she is walking along, loudly lamenting her fate and reviling life, when one of her father's henchmen slips up behind her, and brutally slits her throat
The movie ends with her lying dead on the grass.

Euan Rabagliati

Colonel Cuthbert Euan Charles Rabagliati, known as Euan Rabagliati, was a pilot, racecar driver and was later recruited by MI6 during World War II serving as head for Holland and Denmark. He shot down the first German plane in World War I by firing with a pistol and his crash at Brooklands was followed by the banning of mechanics racing alongside their drivers.
Biography.
Cuthbert Euan Charles Rabagliati (1892-1978), was the son of Andrea Rabagliati.
Head of MI6 Danish and Dutch Country Sections 1940-49. 
Married Beatrix Oliver 1940 (died 1992).
Served RFC World War I (M.C., A.F.C.)
World War I.
He had one of the earliest pilot's licences and joined KOYLI (the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry) and ultimately the Royal Flying Corps.
He shot down the first German plane during World War I. On 25 August 1914, with Lt C.W. Wilson he forced down a German Etrich Taube which had approached their aerodrome while they were refueling their Avro.
1930 Brooklands Crash.
During the Easter 1930 Double Twelve Hour Race the car which had been running fourth in Max Aitken’s hands was withdrawn after the other two team cars of Rabagliati and Hebeler collided. Rabagliati was seriously injured, his mechanic and one spectator died in what was one of Brooklands’ worst accidents. 
Towards the end of the first days race, Rabagliati and Ted who was his riding mechanic at the time, were chasing the Alfa Romeo of Ivanovsky and Eyston when they came upon Archie Frazer-Nash's Austin 7 which was travelling considerably slower in the center of the track. See June 1930 Motor Sport " The JCC Double Twelve".
As Rabagliati swerved to avoid the Austin he got sideways and was hit by Hebeler in one of the other Talbots. The Rabagliati and Allery Talbot rolled into the infield spectator area causing carnage. Twenty people were injured, many of them seriously. Ted and one of the spectators died at the scene. Rabagliati suffered head injuries but survived as did the other injured spectators.
Rabagliati was left for dead but miraculously survived the crash following surgical insertion of a silver plate cap to the front of his skull. After waking from a coma, his first words was to ask for a bottle of champagne.
The accident gave rise to the legal case: Hall v Brooklands Auto Racing Club, after which the signs "Motor Racing is Dangerous" were displayed at all race meetings.
Working for MI6.
In the book 'The Hornet's Sting' by Mark Ryan (2008) about Danish second world war spy Thomas Sneum, Rabagliati's role as head of MI6 in charge of Holland and Denmark is described from interviews with Sneum who met Rabagliati on 25 June 1941 at his London home in St. James's close to the offices of MI6. Rabagliati persuaded Sneum to work as a spy having survived a heroic crossing of the North Sea in a Hornet Moth. 
By December 1941 Rabagliati together with van 't Sant had infiltrated five agents into occupied Holland, but only one, Aart Alblas, was left at liberty. He was arrested as other agents, often as a result of betrayal, and executed at Mauthausen in 1944.
Rabagliati is described as small in stature but tenacious and professional.
During World War II Euan Rabagliati was in charge of a secret operation called Contact Holland. During this operation Dutch secret agents were put ashore in Scheveningen (occupied Holland). One of them was Peter Tazelaar, who went ashore in a tuxedo; this was source of inspiration for the James Bond movie Goldfinger pre-title sequence. Operation Contact Holland also was the inspiration for another movie, Soldier of Orange (where Euan Rabagliati was played by Edward Fox). 
After the war he was British vice-consul in San Francisco, eventually retiring to Cannes in the South of France.

Georg Hansen

Colonel Georg Alexander Hansen (5 July 1904, Sonnefeld, Saxe-Coburg and Gotha – 8 September 1944, Plötzensee, Germany ) was an "Oberst" (Colonel) in the "Generalstab" (General Staff of the German Army) and one of the participants in the German Resistance against the Nazi Regime of Adolf Hitler.
Early life.
George Hansen was born in Sonnefeld, the son of Theodor Hansen, a "Oberforstmeister" (Senior Ranger) for the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In Coburg, he attended since 1914 the "Gymnasium" (high school) Casimirianum, where he graduated in 1923. He then studied law for two semesters at the University of Erlangen. In 1924 he joined the "Panzergruppe" of the "Reichswehr" (later the "Wehrmacht"). He was promoted to "Leutnant" in 1927, and then "Oberleutnant" in 1931 at the Bavarian Motor Vehicles Department in Fürth. In the same year he married Irene Stölzel from Michelau; with her he had five children.
In 1935 Hansen became the commander of the general staff training at the Military Academy ("Kriegsakademie") in Berlin-Moabit, where he met the Chief of General Staff Ludwig Beck and Graf Claus von Stauffenberg. In 1937, he was transferred from the training academy to the Department of Foreign Intelligence and Counterintelligence (Department of Foreign Armies of the East) in the War Ministry of the Reich under the command of "Konteradmiral" Wilhelm Canaris. Beginning in 1939, this department was renamed as "Amt Ausland / Abwehr" (Office of the Foreign Military Intelligence). There Hansen, as a group leader in Division I, was promoted to Major in May 1941 and "Oberstleutnant" in July 1942. In 1943 he succeeded Hans Piekenbrock as the Chief of the Division I, Secret Intelligence Service. His tasks included military reconnaissance in the foreign countries. Finally, Canaris, before his resignation in February 1944, appointed Georg Hansen to succeed him as Head of Military Intelligence. In March 1944 Hansen attended a meeting with the "Sicherheitsdienst" (SD) to set up a unified intelligence service. Two months later, in May 1944, he and most of his staff were transferred to the "Reichssicherheitshauptamt" (RSHA), where he served as the deputy under his immediate superior, Walther Schellenberg.
Assassination Attempt on Hitler.
Probably under the influence of Beck, Hansen's conversion took himself to the opposition by 1938; the official review of the crimes of the Nazi Regime might have led him to finally join the Resistance. He was one of the key informants of the resistance group led by two men, "Generalmajor" Henning von Tresckow and "Oberst" Claus Count von Stauffenberg. Hansen worked since 1943 in all plans for the Hitler assassination attempt. In 1944, he took part in the most important meetings about the preparations. Hansen organized the use of cars and airplanes as well as the protection of the co-conspirators. His house in Rangsdorf often served as the meeting place for the conspirators. If the attack succeeded, he would occupy the RSHA and have the SS commanders arrested. In addition, it was planned to have him, on the behalf of Beck, who was assigned as interim Head of State, to negotiate with General Dwight D. Eisenhower for a separate accord of peace with the Western Powers. Because of strong disagreements with Stauffenberg about the political plans after the attack, Hansen decided on short notice against personal participation and drove on 18 July to Michelau for the baptism of his youngest daughter. Although he knew that Hitler had survived the attack and that the coup attempt had failed, and despite the possibility of escape, he returned on 21 July with his wife because, as he said, "my place is in Berlin”. On 22 July the Gestapo chief, Heinrich Müller, summoned him to the RSHA, where Hansen was arrested in the waiting room. He was put through a prolonged interrogation, during which he broke down and confessed to everything.
On 4 August he was given by the "Ehrenhof" (Court of Honor), formed two days earlier, a dishonorable discharge from the Wehrmacht, so that the courtmartial ("Reichskriegsgericht") was no longer responsible for the sentencing.
Death.
On the day of the arraignment, 10 August 1944, Georg Hansen, as well as Erich Fellgiebel, Alfred Kranzfelder, Fritz-Dietlof Graf von der Schulenburg and Berthold Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg were, in a show trial at the "Volksgerichtshof" under President Roland Freisler, sentenced to death. On 8 September 1944, the judgment was execution by hanging at Plötzensee Prison.
Aftermath.
In comparison, the Hansen family was deemed to be guilty by association. Its properties were confiscated, the wife was arrested, and the five children were placed in a children's home in Bad Sachsa, where they were not permitted to carry the family name. In the same home were also the children of other resistance fighters, such as the Stauffenbergs and von Witzlebens. In late September 1944, the children were allowed to return to their mother, who was also released, in Michelau.
The hostility towards the family continued even after the end of the war. Hansen's widow waged a year-long fight against the Federal Republic of Germany in the courts to obtain a pension as a war widow. But the courts denied her because her husband had been dishonorably discharged from the "Wehrmacht".

Blackburn Type D

The Blackburn Type D, sometimes known as the "Single Seat Monoplane", was built by Robert Blackburn at Leeds in 1912. It is a single-engine mid-wing monoplane. Restored shortly after the Second World War, it remains part of the Shuttleworth Collection and is the oldest British flying aeroplane.
Development.
The Type D, a wooden, fabric-covered single-seat monoplane powered by a 50 hp (40 kW) Gnome rotary engine, was built for Cyril Foggin in 1912.
The design inherited some features from the earlier Mercury: it too had thin wings of constant chord with square tips of about the same span as the later Mercuries and used wing warping rather than ailerons. The wing was wire braced from above via a kingpost and below via the undercarriage, and was built up around machined I-section ash spars. The Type D also had the triangular cross-section fuselage seen on several of Blackburn's aircraft from the Second Monoplane onward.
It was a neater-looking machine with a shorter fuselage, cowled engine, simplified undercarriage and heavily-revised empennage. The fuselage had rounded upper decking and aluminium covering at the front. Blackburn had persisted with the Second Monoplane's Antoinette-style fin and tailplane through subsequent aircraft, but the Type D's tailplane had a much less steeply swept leading edge (though still 60°) than its predecessors and carried a divided elevator. The fin likewise was less swept though still long, and now carried a single rudder rather than the characteristic triangular pair previously used. The undercarriage featured a pair of wheels, compared with four on the Mercury, with two struts per side terminating on skids and joined by the axle and a higher transverse strut. For the first time, Blackburn fitted a rudder bar in preference to his "triple steering column".
The aircraft first flew late in 1912. Some modifications followed in time: the engine cowling was extended into a semicircular shape to discourage the discharge of smoke and hot oil from the rotary into the cockpit; the wing tips were slightly rounded; and the crook-shaped skids were replaced by ones of hockey stick form.
In 1913 the basic Type D design was developed into the two-seat Blackburn Type I.
Operational history.
Harold Blackburn used the Type D for a series of demonstration flights from Lofthouse Park, situated between Leeds and Wakefield, from March to May 1913. He also flew to neighbouring towns: to Stamford, dropping leaflets; to Harrogate, where he landed; and on three successive days in late July to York, carrying bundles of the Leeds-printed "Yorkshire Post". Foggin sold the aircraft on to Montague Glew, who crashed it in 1914 on the family farm at Wittering, where the remains lay untouched until discovered by Richard Ormonde Shuttleworth in 1938. After the War, the machine was restored by Shuttleworth's engineers. Almost all of the restored aircraft was original apart from the main wing spars, engine cowling, some minor wooden pieces and of course the fabric. The original Gnome was also discovered, though the restored aircraft used a slightly newer (1916) Gnome. The restored Type D flew on 17 September 1947, and still flies on quiet days with the Shuttleworth Collection, Britain's oldest active aircraft.

Sydney Nicholls

Sydney 'Sid' Herbert Nicholls (29 May 1868 – 24 November 1946) was an English-born dual code rugby forward who played club rugby under the union code for Cardiff and in his later years league rugby with Hull. Nicholls won four caps for Wales and was part of the Welsh team that beat the first touring Southern Hemisphere team the New Zealand Natives. He was the elder brother of Wales rugby legend Gwyn Nicholls, and his son Jack Nicholls was a Welsh international footballer.
Life history.
Nicholls was born in 1868 in Hartpury, England to Hartley Nicholls, a farm supervisor, and his wife Jane Eliza (née, Millard). The second eldest of five children, he had an elder sister and five younger brothers, the third of his brothers being Gwyn Nicholls. In the mid-1870s the family left England and crossed over to Wales, where the family settled in Roath. After the end of his rugby career, Nicholls became a publican and in 1894 he acquired a business interest in the Grand Hotel, opposite the Cardiff Arms Park. Nicholls would run the Grand up until 1901, when he decided to become a professional rugby league player. Now a veteran player, Nicholls was still able to demand a five figure sum for his switch to the league code. He left Wales for Hull that year, returning in 1910.
He was instrumental in the growth of Cardiff City F.C. and "Cardiff City was admitted to the Second Division of the Southern League in 1910. A board of directors was elected with S. H. Nicholls as the first chairman."
He went on to become Chairman of Council of South Wales Football Association between 1920–1921 and was a Director of Cardiff City when they reached the F.A. Cup final in 1927. He was influential in critical team decisions in the run up to the cup final and almost removed the Cardiff Captain, Fred Keenor, in the run up to the match. "Keenor was officially listed at a meeting of club directors at The Corporation pub in Canton on January 19, 1927. At the summit, called by Sid Nicholls, fellow board member Walter Riden – Keenor's old teacher at Stacey Road Primary School in Adamsdown – proposed listing the captain. Nicholls seconded the idea and Keenor's future at Ninian was in jeopardy. But within weeks the skipper won his place back, his name was removed from the list and on April 23 he led the Bluebirds to their most famous victory, a 1–0 win over Arsenal.". Nicholls is seen in film newsreels of the match introducing King George V to the Cardiff City players and sat with the King to watch the match. By June 1928 Nicholls was the Vice-President F. A. Wales.
Around 1920, Nicholls had met Katherine Brennan and went on to have a second family with her consisting of five sons and one daughter out of wedlock, scandalous for the time. He lost his money in the stockmarket crash of 1929, bringing up the family in poverty in Splott, Cardiff in the 30s. He married Katherine Brennan in 1934.
Rugby career.
Nicholls joined Cardiff while still in his teens and was part of the Second XV during the teams unbeaten 1885–86 season. The following season he was part of the first team and in 1888 he scored 11 tries for the club, a large number for a forward. He later became vice-captain of the first team to Charlie Arthur's captaincy.
Nicholls was first selected to represent Wales in 1888, in the first match between the country and Southern Hemisphere opposition, the New Zealand Natives. The game was played at St. Helen's, Swansea, in front of a hostile home crowd, unhappy at the lack of Swansea players in the back positions. Nicholls was one of eight new caps in the Welsh team, which included Cardiff team-mate Norman Biggs. Nicholls was instrumental in setting up the second try for Jim Hannan, in a 5–0 Welsh win. A week later Nicholls was part of the Cardiff team that faced the same New Zealand side. Cardiff were victorious, with Nicholls scoring a try which was jointly given to Nicholls and W.T. Morgan.
Nicholls was reselected for Wales in the very next international, a match against Scotland as part of the 1889 Home Nations Championship. Under the captaincy of Frank Hill, Wales were beaten by two tries to nil, though selectors kept faith with Nicholls when he was chosen for the final game of the tournament to Ireland. After another loss, Nicholls found himself out of favour and was replaced by William Williams. Nicholls played just one more game for Wales in the 1891 Championship as part of Willie Thomas' team that took on Scotland. The Scottish outplayed Wales scoring seven tries without reply, with the Welsh team hamstrung by an inefficient pair of halves.
Nicholls retired from playing rugby union in 1891, but in 1901, he was lured North to take up professional rugby league. The decision was a shock to his family, but the money for turning professional was good. He joined Hull Rugby League in the 1901/02 season and remained with the club until 1910, when Nicholls was 41.
International matches played under the union code.

Janzur

Janzur or Janzour ( ), also known as Zanzur, is a city in north-western Libya, situated on the Libyan coastline of the Mediterranean Sea, located in the west of the capital Tripoli, and East of Az-Zawiya. Residents of this city are called Janazrah (plural of Janzouri-one who is from Janzour).
Janzour consists of Eight major areas, namely Janzour As-Souq (جنزور السوق) and Janzour Al-Garbiyah (جنزور الغربية) and Janzour Ash-Sharqiya (جنزور الشرقية) and Janzour Al-wasat (جنزور الوسط) and AL-gheiran (الغيران) and An-Njila (النجيلة) and As-Sayad (الصياد) and Alhachan (الحشان).
Naming and population.
Indigenous peoples are Mejres (مجريس) and Tasa (تاسا), They are sons of one father claims Wkhian (وخيعن), from the tribe of Houara, but today the city is considered far from tribalism, and mixed from several origins of Houara of sons of Gharyan and Mslath, Misrata and Tarhona and Orfeila, and the families of the tribe of Nafusa and the families of tribe of Zanata, and Arabs of Banu Dabbab.
Janzur is derived from the Latin word "Censor". And some say that janzour distorted from zanzur, and is barbaric word, means the sun's rays reflected in the water, and in Janzour was water streams and the sunlight reflection in these streams, so named zanzur.
History.
On March 6, 1912, the Italian forces became the first to use airships in war, as two dirigibles dropped bombs on Turkish troops and Libyan Mujahideen encamped at Janzour, from an altitude of 6,000 feet.
Janzour become a Baladiyah follow the Greater Tripoli Muhafazah, Janzur has was part of Jafara District since 2001. Before that it was part of Zawiya District in 1998 and Before that it was part of Tripoli District in 1995 and Before that it was part of Tarabulus Baladiyah in 1987 and Before that it was part of Janzour Baladiyah in 1983.
Agriculture.
The area is of great agricultural value because of the winter rain and the mild weather. The palm and olive trees used to be widespread in the city; however, due to urban planning, and the dramatic increase of people colonization, a lot of these trees disappeared especially the orange trees.

Battle of Dorestad

The Battle of Dorested was a 7th-century battle between the Franks and the Frisians. The battle took place around 690 by the capital city of the Frisians close to the Rhine. The Franks were victorious in the battle under the mayor of the palace Pepin of Herstal. Though not all the consequences of the battle are clear, Dorestad became Frankish again and also the castles of Utrecht and Fechten. It is presumed that the influence of the Franks then reached from south of the Oude Rijn to the coast, but this is not entirely clear because the influence of the Frisians over the central river area was not entirely lost.

Eudorus of Alexandria

Eudorus of Alexandria (; 1st century BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher, and a representative of Middle Platonism. He attempted to reconstruct Plato's philosophy in terms of Pythagoreanism.
He formulated a teleological principle for Platonism, derived from the "Theaetetus": "as much as we can, become like God." In this he believed that he had found an apt definition of the common goal of Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato. His metaphysics and cosmology combined Platonist, Pythagorean and Stoic ideas.
He is mentioned by Alexander of Aphrodisias as a commentator on Aristotle's "Metaphysics", which he is said to have criticized. Simplicius refers to him as a Peripatetic philosopher, and relates that he had written on the Aristotelian "Categories". He was a native of Alexandria, and had, like Aristo of Alexandria, written a work on the Nile.

Khamak

The Khamak is a string instrument close to "ektara", originating in India, common in folk music of Bengal, Orissa and North East India, especially Baulgaan. It is a one-headed drum with a string attached to it which is plucked. The only difference from ektara is that no bamboo is used to stretch the string,which is held by one hand, while being plucked by another.
Characteristics and use.
The khamak consists of three basico parts. A bowl which is often made out of wood is connected by several strings to another, smaller piece (also usually made out of wood). The bowl is held under the arm holding the smaller piece in the hand of same arm. Finally, the string are plucked by the other hand while adjusting the tension of strings creating the desired sound.It is generally used in Bengali boul (folk) songs.It is one of the most ancient string instrument in eastern India.

<doc id="21626864" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21626864" title="Electrical cardiometry">
Electrical cardiometry

Electrical cardiometry is a method based on the model of "Electrical Velocimetry", and non-invasively measures stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and other hemodynamic parameters through the use of 4 surface ECG electrodes. Electrical cardiometry is a method trademarked by Cardiotronic, Inc., and is U.S. FDA approved for use on adults, children, and neonates.
Theory.
The measured bioimpedance over time can be expressed as the superposition of three components:
where Z0 is the quasi-static portion of the electrical impedance (base impedance), ΔZR are the changes of impedance due to the respiratory cycle, and ΔZC are the changes of impedance due to the cardiac cycle. ΔZR is considered an artifact akin to the estimation of stroke volume and is therefore suppressed. Exclusion of derived volumetric data may diminish the overall product. 
The timely measurement of ΔZC (dZ(t)) reveals a waveform with shape similar to an arterial pressure waveform. The calculated first time derivative of dZ(t) is the formula_2 waveform, which contains landmarks that allow determination of left-ventricular ejection time (LVET) and peak aortic blood acceleration. The peak aortic blood acceleration occurs at the steepest slope of the dZ(t) waveform, and at the peak of the formula_2 waveform.
Electrical velocimetry.
"Electrical velocimetry" (EV) is the model which electrical cardiometry is based. EV is based on the fact that the conductivity of the blood in the aorta changes during the cardiac cycle. EV was developed by Dr. Bernstein and Dr. Osypka in 2001, as a new model for interperating the bioimpedance signals of the thorax.
Prior to opening of the aortic valve, the red blood cells (erythrocytes) assume a random orientation (there is no blood flow in the aorta). When the electric current is applied from the outer electrodes, the current must circumference these red blood cells, therefore resulting in a higher voltage measurement, and thus, a lower conductivity. Shortly after aortic valve opening, the pulsatile blood flow forces the red blood cells to align in parallel with the blood flow. When the electric current is then applied, it is able to easily pass the red blood cells in the aorta resulting in a lower voltage, and thus, a higher conductivity. The change from random orientation to alignment of red blood cells upon opening of aortic valve generates a characteristic steep increase of conductivity or dZ(t) (corresponding to a steep decrease of impedance) – beat to beat.
The model considers the peak amplitude of formula_2 divided by the base impedance Z0 as an index for peak aortic acceleration, and as an index of contractility of the heart, or ICON. The general equation for estimating stroke volume by means of thoracic electrical bioimpedance calculates the product of a patient constant CP (in ml), the mean blood velocity index formula_5FT (measured in s−1 during flow time, and FT (flow time measured in s):
formula_6
The model of electrical velocimetry derives the mean blood velocity index formula_5FT from the measured index for peak aortic acceleration ICON. The higher the mean blood velocity during flow time, the more SV the left ventricle ejects. The 'volume of electrically participating tissue' (VEPT) is used as the patient constant. The VEPT is derived primarily from the body mass.
Comparisons.
Impedance Cardiography.
Impedance cardiography is a method of non-invasively monitoring hemodynamics, through the use of 4 dual sensors placed on the neck and chest. Both Impedance cardiography and Electrical Cardiometry derive SV and CO from measurements of TEB, but the underlying model is what differs. The Impedance Cardiography model contributes the rapid change of bioimpedance which occurs shortly after aortic valve opening to the expansion of the compliant ascending aorta, assuming that more blood volume temporarily stored in the ascending aorta contributes to a decrease in bioimpedance (or an increase in conductity of the thorax). The underlying model never proved accurate in patients with small cardiac outputs, hence it was never U.S. FDA approved for use in children or neonates.
Parameters.
The electrical and impedance signals are processed, and then utilized to measure and calculate hemodynamic parameters such as cardiac output, stroke volume, systemic vascular resistance, thoracic fluid index, ICON (index of contractility), and systolic time ratio.

Alex Janvier

Alex Janvier, AOE (born 1935) is a Native Canadian artist. As a member of the commonly referred to “Indian Group of Seven”, Janvier is a pioneer of contemporary Canadian aboriginal art in Canada.
History.
Alex Janvier was born on Le Goff Reserve, Cold Lake First Nations, northern Alberta in 1935 of Dene Suline and Saulteaux descent. At the age of eight, he was sent to the Blue Quills Residential Indian School near St. Paul, Alberta, where the principal recognized his innate artistic talent and encouraged him in his art. Alex Janvier received formal art training from the Alberta Institute of Technology and Art in Calgary (now the Alberta College of Art and Design) and graduated with honours in 1960. Immediately after graduation, Janvier took up an opportunity to instruct art at the University of Alberta. In 1966, the federal Department of Indian and Northern Affairs commissioned him to produce 80 paintings. He helped bring together a group of artists for the Indians of Canada Pavilion at Expo 67, among them Norval Morrisseau and Bill Reid. Janvier currently runs a gallery called Janvier Gallery in Cold Lake, AB with his family.
Style.
Alex Janvier, the 'first Canadian native modernist,' has created a unique style of modernist abstraction, his own “visual language,” informed by the rich cultural and spiritual traditions and heritage of the Dene in northern Alberta. His abstract style is particularly suited to large-scale works. He makes magic arts and 3d arts.
Politics.
Alex Janvier signed his paintings with his Treaty Number from 1966 to 1977 to protest government policies against Aboriginal people.
"Morning Star".
At the river end of the Grand Hall of the Canadian Museum of Civilization is a dome rising seven stories above the granite floor. Nineteen metres (62 feet) in diameter, the dome is adorned with Alex Janvier's striking abstract painting "Morning Star". With the assistance of his son Dean, Janvier began painting in June 1993 and finished in September the same year. "Morning Star" covers 418 square metres (4,500 square feet).
The title "Morning Star" refers to the morning star as a guide or a means of finding direction. Each of the four distinct areas of colour in the outside ring represents a period in Native history:
"In the yellow quadrant, a balance of colour and shape reflects a time when the First Peoples were in harmony with nature, with the Great Spirit, and with each other. However, also represented in this yellow area is the arrival of Columbus in 1492, which changed the world of the First Peoples forever.
In the blue quadrant, a lack of decoration signifies the weakness of Native culture, overwhelmed by European culture. According to Janvier, the more Christianized Native people became, the more they turned to organic, flowing designs and the less they produced geometric designs.
The red quadrant depicts a time of revival and a new optimism. Struggle and disenchantment give way to a new determination on the part of First Peoples to take charge of their own future.
The last quadrant, white to link back to the white centre of Morning Star, portrays healing, renewed self-respect, reconciliation and restructuring - a return to a state of harmony. It represents the period following the point at which Janvier created Morning Star."

Bidzar

Bidzar is an archaeological site from Guider, Cameroon, featuring petroglyphs between 3000 and 300 years old. The site, currently under threat from local cement and marble manufacturing operations, is being considered for inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage list of sites with "outstanding universal value" to the world.
Site Description.
The Bidzar petroglyphs are located near Bidzar village, on the Maroua-Garoua road toward Guider. An area of marble flagstone extending around the village "circa" from north to south, and from east to west displays around 500 engraved figures in total. The marble is of a calcareous type called cipolin; it has an ideal composition for engraving, having low resistance to friction and breaking easily. Figures were engraved into the marble using a hammer and an engraving tool. The figures are mostly geometrical, consisting of groups of circles, some isolated and some in groups. It has been speculated that the engraving represent concepts or stories from myths, or elaborate a cosmogeny.
History.
The age of the engravings has proven difficult to determine. Radiometric dating has produced a range of estimates, dating various carvings to between 300 and 3000 years of age.
The petroglyph site was discovered in 1933 by a French researcher named Buisson.
World Heritage Status.
In the twentieth and twenty first centuries, the calcareous marble on which the engravings stand has been extracted for use at nearby cement and marble factories. This activity endangers the engravings, which received provisional protection when the site was included in the Cultural category of the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List, on April 18, 2006.

Planet Manga released the manga between July 12, 2001 and October 24, 2002 in Italy. It is being distributed online by JManga.
Reception.
Manga Sanctuary series of reviews, regards the characters to be "less endearing" than those of Yui's "Kirara", and the humor to be "less effective" in the first volume review, goes further in criticism by describing the second volume reading experience as devoid of emotion and the last volume as leaving a bitter after taste so much the manga is ill built and rushed. The French manga dictionary "Dicomanga" pointed to the author's large usage of computer software which gives a particular yet slightly icy tone to his universe. SplashComics noted that the author used the technique of using photographs as backgrounds. SplashComics described the second volume as being "a typical Yui: Girls and ghosts", noting that although the series was tamer than "Kirara", that fanservice was provided via tight shirts and short skirts, and felt the ending was "a little disappointing".

Robert Appleby Bartram (shipbuilder)

Sir Robert Appleby Bartram, JP (23 April 1835 – 1925) was a British shipbuilder.
Bartram was born in South Hylton, County Durham (now part of Sunderland), and was the son of the shipbuilder George Bartram (1800–1891) and his wife Margaret, née Appleby (1809–1870). On 28 December 1859, he married Ann Naizby (1837–1870) at St Mary's Church, South Hylton. They had four children: George (1860–1910), William Naizby (1862–1923), Margaret Appleby (1865–1906) and Robert Appleby (1867–?). After his wife's death, he married Margaret Agnes Rhind (1833–1900) in 1878 at Woodhaven, Fife. On his father's retirement in 1871, Bartram took over the family company, Bartram & Sons.
On 7 February 1889, he laid the foundation stone of St George's Presbyterian Church in Ashbrooke, Sunderland. In the late 19th century, Bartram gave £10,500 (approximately £800,000 in 2007) to Sunderland Town Council for the establishment of technical scholarships, which in turn led directly to the establishment of Sunderland Technical College in 1901, one of the forerunners of the University of Sunderland. On 2 June 1922, Bartram was gazetted a Knight Bachelor as "ne of the Senior JP's of Sunderland. Leading educationalist from 1870. A generous benefactor to charitable, religious and educational bodies in Sunderland" and knighted at Buckingham Palace by George V on 8 July 1922.

Caroline Park

Caroline Park is a 17th-century mansion in the Granton area of Edinburgh. It was constructed between 1683 and 1696 for Sir George Mackenzie, 1st Viscount Tarbat, and his wife Anna. It is protected as a category A listed building for its "sophisticated French-influenced principal (south) elevation and some very fine intact internal features".
History.
Around 1585, Andrew Logan built a mansion on the site, known as Royston House, it was an L-plan building. Between 1683 and 1696 the house was completely rebuilt by Sir George Mackenzie on a quadrangular plan. In 1739 John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll, purchased the house and renamed it Caroline Park after his daughter. He commissioned William Adam to design an extension, which was built in 1740–1741. By 1793 it had been inherited by Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch. In the 19th century it was leased to tenants including Henry Cockburn and Alicia Scott, composer of the tune "Annie Laurie".
After undergoing various changes throughout the centuries, during the 1980s the building fell into a state of disrepair having been surrounded by developments since the Industrial Revolution. After years of independent renovation work, the house and its modest grounds have been returned to close to their former state, and are once again in domestic use. The privately owned house features Italian plaster-work and painted ceilings, intricate wrought iron balustrades, wooden panels and carvings.

Lewis Buckner

Lewis Buckner (March 12, 1856—May 16, 1924) was an American house builder and carpenter. Born and raised a slave, Buckner went on to become one of several successful African-American construction entrepreneurs in late-19th century Sevier County, Tennessee. At least fifteen homes that were either built by Buckner or are believed to have been built by Buckner are still standing, two of which are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.
Biography.
Buckner was born in Strawberry Plains, Tennessee in 1856. He is believed to have been the son of a Caucasian father and an African-American mother. In the 1870s, Buckner learned the trade of furniture-making while an apprentice to a Sevierville furniture-maker named Christian Stump. Buckner married his first wife, Jane Bryant, in 1875, and by 1880 had established his own cabinet-making business. 
Buckner built his first house— the Darius and Mary Robertson House— around 1880. Buckner's subsequent houses included the Wayland-Patterson House (1886) near the Fair Garden community, the Riley H. Andes House (ca. 1890) in Sevierville, the Trotter-Waters House (1895) in downtown Sevierville, the Sam Dixon House (1914) near the Shady Grove Community, and the Mullendore House (1921) near Pigeon Forge. He built his own house in the Mullican Grove community in 1894. In 1886, Buckner teamed up with African-American bricklayer Isaac Dockery (1832-1910) to help build the New Salem Baptist Church in Sevierville, with Dockery doing the church's brickwork and Buckner doing much of the interior design.
Buckner's techniques.
While most of Buckner's designs were not entirely original— most were taken from circulated pattern books— Buckner did create his own unique renditions of these basic patterns. Buckner's houses were typically 2-story Italianate or Queen Anne "I-frame" designs. Buckner often did much of the houses' exterior detailing— which included bargeboards, porches, and scrollwork— as well as the houses' interior elements, including mantels, cabinets, and newell posts.
Structures built by Buckner.
At least fifteen houses currently standing in Sevier County are believed to have been built by Buckner, although some have not been verified by any source other than oral tradition or the fact that certain designs strongly resemble Buckner's known works. Houses built or renovated by Buckner include:

Kubos

Art Style: KUBOS, known as Art Style: precipice in North America and Art Style: nalaku in Japan, is a puzzle video game developed by skip Ltd. and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DSi's DSiWare digital distribution service.
Gameplay.
Players must change the colors of blocks by controlling a character who walks on and climbs up on them. As blocks fall from the sky, the player must also avoid these, and avoid stepping on blocks when they are shaking. Cubes can be climbed on to the next level and even pushed over in order to get all the cubes touched on the same level to score more points. Special pick up object blocks gives the character a mega punch to knock blocks off on the level in the direction of the punch. If they don't retrieve the object, the section of blocks disappear. If the character stands on a multi-color flash block, their energy level is restored by as much as half of the energy meter displayed on the left of the game screen. To get better viewing angles, the player can rotate the cube tower 90 degrees in either direction, or looking at the tower from above, to let the player see where the character is going and if any cubes will be falling in that section, or if there are no cubes in one section. The game is cleared when the character climbs up ten floors and the score only counts when the ten floors are cleared.
The endless mode is where the character stands on a 3X3 block level and blocks continuing to fall down. If the character stands on all of the blocks on the same floor in endless mode, their energy level is fully restored. More blocks continue to fall up to as many as eight, until the character climbs up every ten floors before the falling blocks ease off for a while.
The game is over if the character is either squashed from a falling block with no energy left, or if they stand on a section of blocks that are about to disappear and the character falls off.
Development.
"KUBOS" was released on February 25, 2009 in Japan, the PAL regions on June 5, 2009 and in North America on August 3, 2009. It was developed by Skip Ltd. and published by Nintendo for the DSiWare service.
Reception.
"KUBOS" was nominated for Game of the Year by Nintendo Power, as well as DSiWare Game of the Year and Best Puzzle Game.

Secundus of Abula

Saint Secundus or Secundius () is venerated as a Christian missionary and martyr of the 1st century, during the Apostolic Age. He evangelized the town of "Abula", which has been identified as either Ávila or Abla, and became its first bishop. 
Ávila may have been the ancient town known as "Abula", mentioned by Ptolemy in his "Geographia" (II 6, 60) as being located in the Iberian region of Bastetania. Abula is mentioned as one of the first cities in Hispania that was Christianized, specifically by Secundus. However, Ávila may have been the ancient "Obila" instead, while "Abula" may have been the town of Abla. 
He is one of the group of Seven Apostolic Men ("siete varones apostólicos"), seven Christian clerics ordained in Rome by Saints Peter and Paul and sent to evangelize Spain. Besides Secundius, this group includes Sts. Hesychius, Caecilius, Torquatus, Euphrasius, Indaletius, and Ctesiphon.

On the general mobilisation of the Dutch military on 28 August 1939, "Van Meerlant" was deployed to lay minefields, including ones at IJmuiden and the Hook of Holland. She sailed for the United Kingdom from Vlissingen alongside the gunboat "Flores", arriving on 18 May 1940. She was first stationed at Falmouth, alongside her sister ship "Douwe Aukes" and the Dutch ship "Medusa". Later that year "Van Meerlant" was posted to Chatham and assigned to the Thames Local Defence Flotilla, responsible for maintaining the boom defences in the Thames Estuary.

My Life (Golda Meir autobiography)

My Life is the autobiography of the first female Prime Minister of Israel, Golda Meir. The book was published by G. P. Putnam's Sons in 1975.
Reception.
The book was a "New York Times" best-seller. The title has the double-entendre of a life story and a well-known Jewish expression. The book was well received by Kirkus Reviews who described the book as "both frank and very revealing of her personality and goals. Her total lack of pretense is especially winning. Meir's practical idealism can be seen in efforts as diverse as the beautification of kibbutzim and her strong advocacy of unemployment benefits. The work that 'most concerned and interested me,' she writes, was 'the translation of socialist principles into the down-to-earth terminology of everyday life.' Although the political events narrated are well known they are recounted with drama and spirit. Don't mistake this for just chicken soup with riposte-noodles: it's a model of its kind and a sure crowd-pleaser."

Boxlife

Art Style; BOXLIFE, known as Art Style: HACOLIFE in Japan, is a puzzle video game developed by skip Ltd. and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DSi's DSiWare digital distribution service.
Gameplay.
The game is set in a factory, where the player is a worker who must cut six squares out of a sheet of paper in various patterns to form cubes (or boxes) which, once folded properly, are lifted away from the playing field. The stylus is used to choose between three options to perform this task: Scissors, to cut the paper; Fold, which enables the player to assemble a cut pattern into a box; and Reattach, to erase cuts made in error.
There are two modes of play: R&D Mode and Factory Mode. In both, the object of the game is the same—to form boxes until the timer runs out—and the player is penalized for any stray squares left over on the playing field afterward.
R&D Mode.
In this mode, different patterns to form cubes are introduced to the player. The player is given sheets of paper squares to work with, and must come up with the correct patterns to cut out of their paper sheets in order to clear the floor entirely before the timer runs out. R&D Mode allows the player character to rise in rank and earn promotions and new outfits or uniforms to wear.
Factory Mode.
In this mode, the player is given a time limit and an endless sheet of paper to cut into boxes that may be scrolled down from the top of the screen as it is used up. Periodically, bombs will fall onto the playing field, and the player may form a box around the bomb to earn a bonus, but if the bomb is allowed to explode, it will burn away adjacent squares of paper. The player is penalized for stray squares left behind and/or any paper that falls off of the screen as it is scrolled downward. Factory Mode allows the player character to earn money, and upon reaching certain amounts the character will gain new items for its miniature garden on the top screen.
Development.
"HACOLIFE" was originally released on February 25, 2009 in Japan. As "BOXLIFE", it was released in North America on June 22, 2009 and in Europe on July 10, 2009. It was developed by skip Ltd. and published by Nintendo for the DSiWare service.
Reception.
"BOXLIFE" has received generally favorable reviews, with an average score of 80.25% on GameRankings and 80% on Metacritic. Reviewers praised the unique presentation and gameplay, as well as the retro music and graphics, but criticized the sometimes iffy controls and steep difficulty.

Crawley Hospital

Crawley Hospital is a National Health Service hospital in Crawley, a town and borough in West Sussex, England. Since 2006 it has been part of the West Sussex Primary Care Trust, which has overall management responsibility. Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust also provides some services. The hospital is located in the West Green neighbourhood of Crawley, near the town centre.
History.
Crawley grew slowly as a small market town until the Second World War. Until 1896, the only medical treatment available was offered in Horsham, away, under the provisions of the various Poor Laws. A cottage hospital with six beds was established that year; by 1913 it had been extended to a nine-bed facility, and there were 12 beds and an operating theatre in 1922. The hospital was paid for by public donations and fundraising; patients paid as much as they could afford for treatment.
These premises became too small, and a new "district hospital" was established at Ifield Lodge in West Green—then a mostly residential area west of Crawley High Street—in the 1930s. In 1947, Crawley was selected as one of the sites for the Government's proposed New Towns—planned communities designed to accommodate people moved out of London, which was overcrowded and war-damaged. The master plan allocated land in the southeast of the development area for a large new hospital, and the 1930s facility was expected to be demolished. Both Crawley Urban District Council (the forerunner of the present Borough Council) and Crawley Development Corporation (the body responsible for planning and developing the New town) supported this proposal, but the regional health authority preferred building a new hospital on the existing site. A public inquiry upheld this demand in 1958, and construction work on a new building started the following year.
The first part of the building was completed in 1961 or 1962. Extensions were built between 1966 and 1970 and in 1981. 
Originally, a full range of services was provided: outpatient care, an Accident and Emergency department and a maternity unit. Funding cuts and the opening of a new hospital in nearby Haywards Heath affected the hospital's status, however, and for a period during the 1990s it was threatened with closure. In 1998 the NHS Trust responsible for the hospital merged with that of East Surrey Hospital in Redhill, Surrey, which was developed as the main facility: services such as Accident and Emergency provision and maternity care were concentrated there over the next few years, and Crawley was downgraded to "sub-acute" status. By 2004, however, the Trust had provided services for cancer patients and children, and in July that year a new 24-hour "Walk-in Centre" was opened, offering an inferior level of service to the former Accident and Emergency department. This was changed in 2007 to an Urgent Treatment Centre. In 2008, paediatric surgery was moved to East Surrey Hospital.
An ambulance station was built in 1963 on Exchange Road in Crawley town centre. It had moved to West Green by the 1980s, and is now operated by the South East Coast Ambulance Service.
Architecture.
The Yorke, Rosenberg and Mardall architectural partnership, led by F. R. S. Yorke and noted for its Modernist hospital designs, received the commission for the hospital. Architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner, writing in 1965, praised the building, describing it as "easily the best building in Crawley up to date". It is a three- to four-storey reinforced concrete structure clad with dark steel, white tiles, red glazed bricks and large areas of glass.

Dimitrios Doulis

Dimitrios Doulis (, 1865–1928), was a Greek military officer, from Nivica in modern southern Albania (Northern Epirus).
Doulis was born in 1865, the son of Kitsios Doulis, a hero of the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire (1821–30). In 1883 he enlisted in the Hellenic Army, while at 1897 he fought in the war against the Ottoman Empire, in the Epirus sector of operations, in which the Greek Army was defeated.
As a Major he took part in the operations in Epirus front during the Balkan Wars of 1912-13. During these, the Greek army occupied the region of Northern Epirus, and Doulis was appointed military commander of Argyrokastro (Gjirokastër). In December 1913 however, with the Protocol of Florence, the Great Powers decided to award the region to the newly formed Albanian state. This decision was highly unpopular among the local Greek population, who decided to form their own government and military in order to secure their autonomy. Doulis resigned his commission in the Greek army and joined the autonomists.
With the official declaration of the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus, in 1 March 1914, he was appointed to the post of Minister of Military Affairs of the new government. From the first days he managed to mobilize an army consisting of more than 5,000 volunteer troops, and organize local gendarmerie units (called "Sacred Bands") in order to secure the region. Until May 17, when the Protocol of Corfu was signed, the autonomist Epirote forces managed retain their positions and push back the attacks of Albanian irregulars and gendarmerie, which was under the command of Dutch officers.
When World War I broke up the Greek forces, after approval from the Triple Entente Powers, re-entered Northern Epirus. At the following national elections Dimitrios Doulis was elected as member of the Greek parliament for the Argyrokastron Prefecture. Doulis retired from the Greek Army with the rank of Colonel on 15 May 1915, and died in Athens in 1928.

GCT 155mm

The GCT 155mm is a modern self-propelled artillery vehicle currently in use by the armies of France and Saudi Arabia. It replaced the former Mk F3 155mm in French Army service. The GCT 155mm's primary advancement is that it incorporates and provides full armor and nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) protection for its crew of four, while the former Mk F3 155mm offered no protection and could carry only two of its four crew members. Though 60% heavier than the American M109, the GCT 155mm is faster, fires faster and incorporated a more sophisticated fire control system. The GCT 155mm saw combat with the Iraqi Army in the Iran–Iraq War.
History.
Though the French Mk 3 155mm would remain in production through the 1980s, by the early 1970s the French Army realized there was an urgent need for its replacement. The Mk. 3 155mm lacked a traversable turret and nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) protection for its crew, and could carry only two of the four crew members needed to operate it (the remaining two having to be transported in support vehicles). Development of the GCT 155mm began in the early 1970s, and the first production version, known as the AUF1, was introduced in 1977. About 400 have been produced, with 70 having been upgraded to the AUF2 variant.
AUF1.
The GCT 155mm AUF1 is based on the AMX-30 main battle tank (MBT) chassis and equipped with a 155mm 39-caliber gun with an auto-loading system, giving a rate of fire of 8 rounds per minute, and a sustained rate of fire of 6 rounds per minute. It is also equipped with a roof-mounted 12.7mm anti-aircraft gun. The AUF1 has an effective range of 23,500 meters firing conventional rounds and 28,000 meters using Rocket Assisted Projectiles (RAPs).
The first production AUF1s were delivered exclusively to the Saudi Arabian Army, while the French Army received their first deliveries in 1980, deploying the GTC 155mm AUF1 in regiments of 18 guns each. In addition, the Iraqi Army received a small number of GTC 155mm AUF1 variants in 1980, which they employed during the Iran–Iraq War.
Operational History.
A battery of 8 AUF1s from the French Army's 40em Regiment d'Artillerie was deployed in support of the Rapid Reaction Force on Mount Igman during the 1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The battery provided rapid counter-battery fire against Serb artillery units during the siege of Sarajevo, the long range of its guns allowing it dominate the surrounding terrain.
AUF2.
The AUF2 is an improved turret for the GCT 155mm designed and built by GIAT. The AUF2 155mm howitzer and turret are designed for integration onto a wider range of armored chassis such as AMX30, Leopard 1, Arjun and T-72. It was initially developed to upgrade the GTC 155mm AUF1 self-propelled howitzers then in service with the French Army. The French Army has procured approximately 70 AUF2 turrets and mounted them on the AMX30B2 chassis.
Improvements in the AUF2 include an all-new automatic round and charge feed system and a new 52-caliber artillery tube. New charges and rounds are also available for the AUF2. The AUF2 is equipped with a 7.62mm anti-aircraft machine gun located at the roof of the turret. The AUF2 turret, including the gun and loading systems, weighs nearly 19 tons. Compared with the AUF1, the AUF2 offers a significantly improved range of 42 km, a higher rate of fire of 10 rounds/minute and multiple rounds simultaneous impact. In use, the weapon system has been found to have greater reliability, accuracy and ease of maintenance.

HNLMS Medusa (1911)

HNLMS Medusa ("HW 1", "A 890") was a Dutch , built in Amsterdam and named after Medusa in Greek mythology.
Service history.
In the late afternoon of 14 May 1940, under constant heavy attack, the "Medusa" sailed for the United Kingdom, reaching The Downs the following day. She was first stationed at Falmouth alongside the two ships of the Douwe Aukes class before being transferred to Holyhead on 31 July 1940 to be the tender to the Dutch depot ship "Stuyvesant". After the war the "Medusa" remained in the UK until 15 January 1946, before returning to the Netherlands to provide accommodation and training facilities for the Mine Service. She was officially decommissioned on 5 June 1965, being sold for scrap the following 25 September to the Jos Desmedt yard in Antwerp.

<doc id="21627326" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21627326" title="Composite propeller">
Composite propeller

Composite propellers are made of an extremely strong, high-tech material. These propellers are produced using an injection molding process, which guarantees a high quality propeller every time. The composite propeller is a lightweight and environmentally friendly boat propeller. When a composite propeller hits debris, the propeller absorbs the impact energy, instead of transferring it to the lower unit; therefore, providing more protection for the drive train. Corrosion from salt water, and electrolysis are nonexistent with composite material.
Advantages.
Lower unit protection is the primary advantage of composite materials. While the initial cost of a composite propeller is usually comparable to aluminum, it is significantly less than a stainless steel propeller. Additionally, replacement blades offer significant savings over metal propeller repairs. Another advantage to using composite propellers is that it is a lightweight material. Composite material is about half the weight of aluminum and 1/6 the weight of stainless steel propeller. A lightweight propeller reduces the amount of wear and tear on the entire boat.
Effect on the Environment.
Composite propellers are 100% recyclable and can help preserve the environment. Recycled propellers reduce material and energy costs for manufacturers allowing for lower costs for consumers.

Love Sex Magic

"Love Sex Magic" is a song recorded by American singer Ciara for her third studio album, "Fantasy Ride" (2009). Featuring fellow American recording artist Justin Timberlake, the song was written by Timberlake and his production team The Y's, as well as Ciara and Mike Elizondo. The Y's and Elizondo also produced the track. The song was released from "Fantasy Ride" as the lead single internationally, and was the second single from that album released in the United States.
The song reveals a complete departure from Ciara's previous style, neither a sensual ballad nor incorporating Crunk&B influences. It embraces a dance-pop sound, while including R&B and funk via a retro 70s-style guitar which is present in the piece. Many critics noted the similarities between the song and music on Timberlake's album "FutureSex/LoveSounds" (2006). Critics gave the song mixed reviews, complimenting the song's funk and retro feel and the chemistry present between Ciara and Timberlake. The song would later go on to be nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 52nd Grammy Awards.
"Love Sex Magic" reached number 10 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, becoming Ciara's fifth top ten hit as a lead artist, her eighth including features, and her first since "Get Up" in 2006. It stands as her best international effort, reaching the top ten in countries such as Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, and France. The music video also exhibits a retro feel inspired by the Crazy Horse cabaret show, and features Timberlake, Ciara, and several different kinds of foreplay, as well as Ciara dancing. For its routines it was nominated for Best Choreography at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. Ciara has performed the song on television a number of times, including on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" and with Timberlake on "Saturday Night Live".
Background.
A song entitled "Magic," performed by Justin Timberlake, leaked online in November 2008. In February 2009, "Rap-Up" reported that Ciara and Timberlake had recorded a new duet for her then-upcoming album, "Fantasy Ride". The final version of the song, initially titled "Love and Sex and Magic," featured Timberlake dueting with Ciara. Eventually known as "Love Sex Magic," the song was written by Timberlake, Mike Elizondo, and Timberlake's production team The Y's—James Fauntleroy II, Timberlake, and Robin Tadross. Timberlake wanted to create a song that both genders could relate to. The Y's and Elizondo produced the song. Ciara said that her collaboration with Timberlake was one of the best of her career, because they actually collaborated in the studio, rather than him being added as a guest feature after the initial recording. She explained, "I actually went into the studio to make the record from scratch, or he had the record there for me, but us being together was a very rare case I've had over the years." Ciara enjoyed her time with Timberlake, and valued the opportunity to work with him as an "artist and producer." She also noted how passionate Timberlake was about his work, and mentioned his humbleness and positive attitude.
Composition.
With "Love Sex Magic," Ciara moved in a more pop direction than her past music. Jordan Sargent of PopMatters noted that while a pop fan might see the singer "back in her mind creatively," a Ciara fan would see the song as "signal the end of the singer's career as it once was." Sargent stated that the song "sounds nothing like the chrome-plated crunk&b nor the moonlit balladry that Ciara has staked her name on." Musically, the song is a dance-pop-R&B number which makes use of electro and funk music, as well as displaying disco and soul influences. The song has a minimalistic dance beat, with a "funky, retro 70s style R&B guitar" as the backdrop. Lauren Carter of the "Boston Herald" said that the song is influenced by Timberlake's disco-funk work on "FutureSex/LoveSounds", stating that "it sounds like a reworked version of his bass-heavy dance number "Sexy Ladies." Carter commented that Timberlake was "ushering Ciara away from her typically crunk-laced stylings in favor of JT’s electro-slide." Ann Powers of "The Los Angeles Times" said that the song was "Madonna-esque." Both Ciara and Timberlake provide verses, accompanied by vocal whims and falsetto. According to Bill Lamb of About.com, the song "lays aside pretentions of deep meaning and instead encourages a fun-filled trip to the dance floor." Lamb noted the "vocal magnetism" between Ciara and Timberlake in the song. He found that the song features a "smooth breakdown."
Critical reception.
Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK said that with the track, Ciara "lucked into the sexiest thing to happen to pop since Timberlake's own "FutureSex/LoveSounds"," calling the song one of the "biggest anthems of the year." Gennoe went on to call the song the "highlight" and "saving grace" of "Fantasy Ride". Nick Levine of Digital Spy said that "the track itself is nearly as sexy as the promo clip", commenting "Ciara purrs, and Timberlake, if you'll pardon the pun, more than rises to the occasion. All in all, 'Love Sex Magic' is pretty much spot on." Lauren Carter of the "Boston Herald" said "It’s not quite magic, but it grows on you." Although stating that it may be "light pop fluff," Bill Lamb of About.com gave the song four out of five stars, calling it a "fun track" that would get "mainstream pop audiences dancing and singing along." Lamb commented that a "funky guitar and appearance by Justin Timberlake may be just enough to carry her back near the top of the pop chart." Jeremy Medina of "Entertainment Weekly" said, "Hooking up with Timberlake essentially guarantees a one-way ticket back to chart supremacy, so nice work there, Ciara." Medina went on to call the song an early candidate for "song of the summer."
Jon Caramanica welcomed the "female aggression" presented by Ciara on the track. Caramanica called it an unexpected twist, calling Ciara "still curiously anonymous". She noted that Timberlake, not a "vocal powerhouse" himself, out-sings Ciara on the track. Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media said that the song was not bad and complimented the song's disco feel. He said that it gained Ciara a "radio foothold that had been hers to lose a couple of years ago", and commented that it seemed like "a bargain-basement Justin Timberlake track, the sort of thing he could've had lying around in a closet somewhere nearly three years after "FutureSex/LoveSounds"." Breihan pointed out that "Timberlake's nerdy swagger really highlights Ciara's total lack of presence." Jordan Sargent of PopMatters criticized the song for being generic, calling it "a formulaic "FutureSex/LoveSounds" disco retread", commenting "The song probably could’ve been given to any struggling female singer and become a hit, and the fact that Ciara had to use it as her parachute is as puzzling as it is unfortunate." Andy Kellman of Allmusic called the song a "hobbling flop" and said that it was "easily forgettable."
At the 52nd Grammy Awards, "Love Sex Magic" was nominated for the award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. It lost to Jason Mraz and Colbie Caillat's "Lucky."
Chart performance.
The song debuted at number eighty-six on the "Billboard" Hot 100, and the next week jumped to number twenty-seven. In its third week, the song rose to number ten, becoming Ciara's fifth top ten single. It was her first top ten entry since "Get Up" in 2006. It was her highest-charting song on the Hot 100 since "Like a Boy" in 2007. "Love Sex Magic" appeared on multiple "Billboard" component charts, reaching number fourteen on the Pop Songs chart, number eighteen Hot Dance Club Songs chart, and eighty-three on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. On the Canadian Hot 100, the song debuted at number nine, and would later peak at number six.
Although the single did not rank among Ciara's most successful singles in the US, it performed well overall in international markets. The song debuted at number six on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart, peaking at number five the next week. It spent fourteen weeks on the chart, and was eventually certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), for shipments totalling 70,000 copies. In New Zealand, the song debuted on the New Zealand Singles Chart at fourteen. It remained stagnant the next week until peaking at six the following week. Having spent thirteen weeks on the chart, the song was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ), for shipments totalling 7,500 copies.
Across Europe, the single charted in the top ten of seven charts, and the top twenty of four others. Due to its numerous chartings in Europe, the song peaked at number six on the European Hot 100 chart. The song saw success in Ireland peaking at number four on the Irish Singles Chart on the week ending April 30, 2009, moving from number seven the previous week. In the UK, "Love Sex Magic" spent seventeen non-consecutive weeks on the UK Singles Chart, debuting at number six and peaking at number five the following week. However, it was a total success on the UK R&B Chart topping the chart for two weeks.
Music video.
The Diane Martel-directed music video for "Love Sex Magic" premiered on March 22, 2009. In an interview with MTV News, Ciara said: "It's all about showing another side of me with this video. I'm basically giving you a show you'd see in Vegas—and it's my love, sex and magic show. He's the voyeur and I play with him a little bit. I got my inspiration from the Crazy Horse show and just from the shows Vegas, period. It's giving you the elements of love and sex and magic." In a later interview about the video, Ciara stated that she had to lick Timberlake's ear, and at one point, he was licking her neck and they were "freestyling." Martel wanted them to do something "edgy," so they found a "cool way to do it." Ciara noted the different pauses in cuts in between the tapings, commenting "so it's licking on the neck, again, then his biting on my neck, again. It was really funny." The singer would later elaborate on the Crazy Horse show reference in an interview with "Blues & Soul", explaining that she had so much respect for the show that it became her reference. On working with Timberlake, she said, "Justin is one of the most easy-going, down-to-earth, hard-working and passionate artists you could ever work with. And, with both me and him, our goal was just to make the best video we could possibly make together, and to give the fans something a little fun and a little unexpected."
Synopsis and reception.
The video opens with Ciara and Timberlake face to face, caressing seductively. The camera cuts to Ciara who appears almost impervious to gravity. Dressed in lingerie, she maneuvers around a horizontal dance pole; background dancers are veiled in vibrant color schemes and alternating strobe lights. The video then cuts to Ciara in a leotard, posing in abstract and flexible poses. Ciara is then seen dressed in a tiger-striped catsuit performing solo dance moves on a stage. Timberlake performs his verse seated onstage while Ciara performs intricate tricks, such as snaking under his legs. Then the two begin to lightly move to the track before Ciara forms her body as an armrest as he leans on her. Ciara and the dancers perform choreography and cabaret-style moves on the pole. The bridge of the song puts Timberlake on the ground and Ciara, standing over him, turns and performs her signature "Matrix" over him as he guides her body toward his with his right hand. The two perform and as Ciara gets up, Timberlake smacks her side as she pops to the beat. The video then cuts to a scene with Ciara in the catsuit portraying a tiger in a cage. In the final scene, Ciara and the dancers perform, dressed in 70s-inspired tuxedos and colored afros. The video ends with clips of Ciara's multiple performance scenes from throughout the video.
Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the video a positive review: "The video that accompanies this track is one of the year's best so far—and certainly the sexiest: Ciara licks Justin's ear, Justin reciprocates by slapping her bum, and, well, Ciara's flexibility would put many a poledancer to shame. Quite frankly, the whole thing could make a nun have impure thoughts." At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for "Best Choreography;" it lost to Beyoncé's "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)." The video ranked at number thirty-nine on BET's "" countdown.
Live performances.
On May 9, 2009, Ciara performed the song on "Saturday Night Live" with Timberlake, that night's host. Accompanied by live instruments, Ciara performed choreography with backup dancers, while Timberlake played the keyboard. Timberlake and Ciara danced provocatively after he came from behind the keyboard to perform his verse. During the set, Ciara also performed "Never Ever." A writer for BET's Sound Off Blog said, "aside from the fact that her grunts were live and her stage humps were unreal, Ciara’s set was pretty decent. Not that I expected any less from the A-Town princess, but that was a pretty tasty performance." The writer pointed out that Timberlake was not even noted on the set until he began his verse. In an interview with MTV News, Ciara went into detail about the setup of the performance, stating: "I just kind of felt cool, 'cause Justin can play real well and he really gets into the music and it was, like, 'Hey, let's make you part of the band.' Having Justin in the background for the live performance was very different from the music video for the song, where the two dance quite provocatively with one another. [We wanted to do something different and make it fun. It was awesome to see him pick up the keys."
On May 13, 2009, Ciara performed the song on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show", accompanied by background dancers. Ciara and the dancers performed choreography similar to that of the video and wore the 70s-inspired suits and afros. The same day, she performed the song with "Never Ever" on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" Ciara performed the song at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards Japan on May 30, 2009.

Maria di Balbi

Maria di Balbi is a fictional character on the German soap opera "Verbotene Liebe (Forbidden Love)" portrayed by actress Simone Ritscher since January 21, 2009. The character was also known by the alias Maria Galdi and the identity of her late sister Francesca von Lahnstein. She left the series on January 7, 2011. Two months later, on March 17, 2011, the character was killed off off-screen to the anger of many fans.
Storylines.
The loyal secretary.
Maria is the loyal private secretary of the Waldensteyck family and arrives together with Princess Luise (Mascha Müller) in Düsseldorf. She schedules every meeting for her and tries to groom her for her assignments as representative of her family. Maria can be very caring, but also very protective when it comes to Luise's indiscretions. When Luise meets the charming pilot Gregor Mann (Andreas Jancke), Maria tries to be the voice of reason and wants her to stop seeing him. Not only is Luise engaged to Eduard von Tepp (Hubertus Regout), she also has a life to live that just wouldn't fit in with the life that Gregor seems to live. Luise listens to Maria and decides to keep her distance from Gregor. She sees him one last time and tells him that she won't return and is leaving town. Only days later, Luise and Gregor meet again at a masked-ball, which is taking place at Castle Königsbrunn. 
Gregor, a good friend of the Lahnstein family and cousin to Stella (Anne Wis), the caretaker of the castle, is also on the guest list. Hidden behind masks Luise and Gregor dance most of the night together under the watchful eyes of Maria. When the masks fall and Luise sees who she is dancing with, she runs off. Gregor asks Maria whether she knew the woman he was dancing with, but Maria denies knowing her. She tries to advise Luise to marry Eduard, but realizes that Luise loves Gregor and can't talk her out of seeing him. Maria tries to stay loyal to Luise and even covers for her when she goes off to see Gregor. When suspicions are aroused that Maria isn't who she says she is and some think that maybe she is the supposedly dead Francesca von Lahnstein, Maria quits her job as private secretary.
The mysterious woman.
With her arrival at Castle Königsbrunn, Maria seems to have a connection with the Lahnstein family. She looks fondly at the Lahnstein children and also acts suspiciously whenever something personal is mentioned. When Maria is alone in the workroom of the castle, she looks at a family photo and touches it tenderly with her hand. Later, in a private moment with Carla von Lahnstein (Claudia Hiersche) she gets the feeling that she needs someone to confide in. Maria tells her that she will always be there for her, if she needs anything. Alone with Carla's daughter Sophia, she also mentions that the little girl would have the eyes of her mother. Followed by recent events, when she looks curious to Elisabeth (Martina Servatius), when she was talking about the late Johannes von Lahnstein (Thomas Gumpert) and when she gets a very weird look by looking at a picture of Johannes' first late wife Francesca. Who is Maria really and what is her connection to the Lahnstein family? After a while some people on Königsbrunn become very suspicious about Maria. While she is interested in the past of Francesca, Leonard von Lahnstein (Lars Korten) begins to think that there might be a connection between Maria and his dead mother Francesca. He tries to find out everything about the woman that there is to know. That's how he discovers that Maria can't be Maria Galdi. The woman that Maria claims to be has been dead for years. Leonard informs Luise about this and they both want to talk to Maria about it. Maria walks away and gives up her job as private secretary of Luise. Leonard can't let the mysterious woman go, without knowing more about her and asks her if she is his supposedly dead mother. Maria is shocked and can't give him a straight answer. Leonard lets Luise in on his suspicion and finds a way that he can prove that Maria really is Francesca von Lahnstein. A birthmark that his mother always tried to hid. He meets with Maria one last time and in fact finds Francesca's birthmark on the same position, where his mother had hers. Maria runs away and is missing for a while. Leonard searches for her and hires a private investigator. Then he lets his siblings Ansgar (Wolfram Grandezka) and Carla in on his suspicion, who are outraged and can't believe that Leonard could actually be right. But his siblings keep thinking about the strange possibility. The very next day, the Lahnstein family gets the surprise of their lives when Maria returns to Königsbrunn and claims that she is in fact Francesca von Lahnstein, the mother of Ansgar, Carla, Leonard and Constantin (Milan Marcus), who currently attends a journalism school in London.
Taking the identity of Francesca.
While Leonard is willing to believe Maria and accept her as his mother, Carla and Ansgar are outraged about Maria's allegations. When asked what kept her all those years away from her family, Maria tells the Lahnsteins that she was witness to a murder by the Italian mafia, while on vacation with Leonard in Italy. The car accident, in which Francesca supposedly died, was faked to save her own life and also the lives of her children. Scared that the mafia would harm him, she had to stay away. Carla doesn't believe anything coming out of Maria's mouth and laughs at her. Ansgar won't believe her either, but when he checks out her story he finds out that Maria is telling the truth about the murder and the anonymous witness. Ansgar decides that he has to be sure and asks her some things from his childhood that only his mother could knew about. Maria doesn't want to answer some questions and proving herself to Ansgar. She wants him to believe her, because he really thinks Maria is who she says she is - Francesca, his mother. Maria does answer Ansgar's questions anyway; Ansgar is shocked with the result and runs away. When Leonard later invites Maria for dinner, Ansgar stands up announcing Maria as head of the family, because she is in fact Francesca. Carla and Elisabeth are shocked and speechless that Ansgar believes Maria too and leave the table. Ansgar's wife Tanja (Miriam Lahnstein) welcomes the idea of Maria being Francesca with open arms. Was Ansgar always Maria's favorite and maybe could win back more power in the family and holing with her help. Maria seems to be open to Tanja at first, but when Ansgar tells her that his marriage is only one of convenience and not love, she tells Tanja what she thinks about her, saying "I can see a misplaying hussy, when it stands right in front of me!". Without doubt an open a declaration of war on Tanja. But not everyone believes Maria just yet and there are still some unanswered questions. The biggest one of all: Is Maria really Francesca von Lahnstein or are Carla and Elisabeth right not to trust her?

Robert Earl Sawyer

Robert Earl Sawyer (June 5, 1923 – November 11, 1994) was an African-American playwright, director and actor.
Early life.
Sawyer was born in Miami, Florida. His parents were Robert Wolworth Sawyer and Merline Thompson Sawyer who emigrated to Floridafrom Nassau, Bahamas. He graduated from the Booker T. Washington High School in Miami.
Sawyer was a United States World War II veteran. After his separation from the military he attended New York University where he studied English and Drama, majoring in creative writing. He spent two additional years of study at the Lajos Egri's School of Writing in New York, where he studied advance creative writing.
Professional life.
He starred, produced and directed his own plays as well as the plays of other writers in New York City, Miami, Washington D.C., Las Vegas, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.
His plays include:
Of "The Breadwinner, "Stephan Miller wrote in "Seattle Post-Intelligencer" in 1971:
One of the beauties of Robert Earl Sawyer’s play ... is that it leaves you feeling so good. It leaves you feeling that whatever miseries consume you at the moment, those of the characters are so much worse and so much more gracefully overcome.
From 1980 until his death in 1994, Sawyer had his own production company called RES (Robert Earl Sawyer) Productions.Sawyer wrote, produced and directed the first black television soap opera "Rainbow Street," in 1989. It aired in Atlanta, GA, Pasadena, CA, Los Angeles, CA and Las Vegas, NV, in 1989.
Activism.
Sawyer was a lifelong activist for human rights, particularly for minorities in the world of arts. He insisted upon a substantially increased representation of minorities in the literary and screen world.
Melody Malmberg wrote in "The Outsiders" in "The Weekly," Altadena, in 1984: Despite the appearance of progress, black artists still find that the entertainment industry is a private club. Here’s why. Six people sat in the Lake Avenue Studio of the Federation for the Advancement of Minority Artists (FAMA) on a recent morning. The talk turned to their professional life. Joe Montell, executive director of FAMA, acted as host. The guests were: Josephine Toussaint, Don Davis, Joseph Taylor, Robert Earl Sawyer and Marlene Labat. Quotations by Robert E. Sawyer:
It's not a problem being black - the problem rests with the undeveloped mentality of those who are in a position to make a moral and intellectual decision about the fundamental equality of minorities. And by having this malfunction they deny the literary and screen world the right to enjoy other cultures and musical and writing geniuses. And at the other side, the lethargy of the black businessman - and the lack of support of black people - also have contributed to the demise and decimation of black talent. It seems to be an unholy union of white discrimination and black lethargy. But the problem is 'not' being black.
Personal life.
He was married to Mamie Lucille Donaldson between 1943 and 1950. They had 2 children together: Errol Sawyer (b. 1943, August 8, 1943), now a photographer; and Wanda Louise Sawyer (January 11, 1945 - 1984 (New York)). From 1957 to 1974 Sawyer lived together with actress Martha Louise Davis. They had 3 children: Robert Alexander Sawyer (b. April 19, 1962), novelist; Kevin DéRoi Sawyer (b. September 28, 1963); Mia Monét Sawyer (b. January 7, 1965). From 1975 to 1986 Sawyer lived and worked together with actress Marlene Labat.
Death.
Robert Earl Sawyer died November 11, 1994, in Oakland, California. He is buried on the Hayward Graveyard in Oakland.

<doc id="21627479" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21627479" title="Globalisation in India">
Globalisation in India

India had the distinction of being the world's largest economy in the beginning of the Christian era, as it accounted for about 32.9% share of world GDP and about 17% The goods produced in India had long been exported to far off destinations across the world. Therefore, the concept of globalisation is hardly new to India.
India currently accounts for 1.2% of World trade as of 2006 according to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Until the liberalisation of 1991, India was largely and intentionally isolated from the world markets, to protect its fledgling economy and to achieve self-reliance. Foreign trade was subject to import tariffs, export taxes and quantitative restrictions, while foreign direct investment was restricted by upper-limit equity participation, restrictions on technology transfer, export obligations and government approvals; these approvals were needed for nearly 60% of new FDI in the industrial sector. The restrictions ensured that FDI averaged only around $200M annually between 1985 and 1991; a large percentage of the capital flows consisted of foreign aid, commercial borrowing and deposits of non-resident Indians.
India's exports were stagnant for the first 15 years after independence, due to the predominance of tea, jute and cotton manufactures, demand for which was generally inelastic. Imports in the same period consisted predominantly of machinery, equipment and raw materials, due to nascent industrialisation. Since liberalisation, the value of India's international trade has become more broad-based and has risen to 63,0801 billion in 2003–04 from 12.50 billion in 1950–51. India's major trading partners are China, the US, the UAE, the UK, Japan and the EU. The exports during April 2007 were $12.31 billion up by 16% and import were $17.68 billion with an increase of 18.06% over the previous year.
India is a founding-member of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) since 1947 and its successor, the World Trade Organisation. While participating actively in its general council meetings, India has been crucial in voicing the concerns of the developing world. For instance, India has continued its opposition to the inclusion of such matters as labour and environment issues and other "non-tariff barriers" into the WTO policies.
Despite reducing import restrictions several times in the 2000s, India was evaluated by the World Trade Organisation in 2008 as more restrictive than similar developing economies, such as Brazil, China, and Russia. The WTO also identified electricity shortages and inadequate transportation infrastructure as significant constraints on trade.
Its restrictiveness has been cited as a factor which has isolated it from the global financial crisis of 2008–2009 more than other countries, even though it has reduced ongoing economic growth.
Payments.
Since independence, India's balance of payments on its current account has been negative. Since liberalisation in the 1990s (precipitated by a balance of payment crisis), India's exports have been consistently rising, covering 80.3% of its imports in 2002–03, up from 66.2% in 1990–91. Although India is still a net importer, since 1996–97, its overall balance of payments (i.e., including the capital account balance), has been positive, largely on account of increased foreign direct investment and deposits from non-resident Indians; until this time, the overall balance was only occasionally positive on account of external assistance and commercial borrowings. As a result, India's foreign currency reserves stood at $285 billion in 2008, which could be used in infrastructural development of the country if used effectively.
India's reliance on external assistance and commercial borrowings has decreased since 1991–92, and since 2002–03, it has gradually been repaying these debts. Declining interest rates and reduced borrowings decreased India's debt service ratio to 4.5% in 2007.
In India, External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) are being permitted by the Government for providing an additional source of funds to Indian corporates. The Ministry of Finance monitors and regulates these borrowings (ECBs) through ECB policy guidelines.
Investment.
Foreign direct investment in India has reached 2% of GDP, compared with 0.1% in 1990, and Indian investment in other countries rose sharply in 2006.
As the third-largest economy in the world in PPP terms, India is a preferred destination for foreign direct investments (FDI); India has strengths in information technology and other significant areas such as auto components, chemicals, apparels, pharmaceuticals, and jewelry. Despite a surge in foreign investments, rigid FDI policies resulted in a significant hindrance. However, due to some positive economic reforms aimed at deregulating the economy and stimulating foreign investment, India has positioned itself as one of the front-runners of the rapidly growing Asia Pacific Region. India has a large pool of skilled managerial and technical expertise. The size of the middle-class population stands at 50 million and represents a growing consumer market.
India's liberalised FDI policy as of 2005 allowed up to a 100% FDI stake in ventures. Industrial policy reforms have substantially reduced industrial licensing requirements, removed restrictions on expansion and facilitated easy access to foreign technology and foreign direct investment FDI. The upward moving growth curve of the real-estate sector owes some credit to a booming economy and liberalised FDI regime. In March 2005, the government amended the rules to allow 100 per cent FDI in the construction business. This automatic route has been permitted in townships, housing, built-up infrastructure and construction development projects including housing, commercial premises, hotels, resorts, hospitals, educational institutions, recreational facilities, and city- and regional-level infrastructure.
A number of changes were approved on the FDI policy to remove the caps in most sectors. Fields which require relaxation in FDI restrictions include civil aviation, construction development, industrial parks, petroleum and natural gas, commodity exchanges, credit-information services and mining. But this still leaves an unfinished agenda of permitting greater foreign investment in politically sensitive areas such as insurance and retailing. FDI inflows into India reached a record US$19.5bn in fiscal year 2006/07 (April–March), according to the government's Secretariat for Industrial Assistance. This was more than double the total of US$7.8bn in the previous fiscal year. The FDI inflow for 2007-08 has been reported as $24bn and for 2008-09, it is expected to be above $35 billion. A critical factor in determining India's continued economic growth and realising the potential to be an economic superpower is going to depend on how the government can create incentives for FDI flow across a large number of sectors in India.
In September 2012 the government approved 51% FDI in multi-brand retails despite a lot of pressure from coalition parties.
Remittances.
Remittances to India are money transfers from Indian workers employed outside the country to friends or relatives in India. India is the world's leading receiver of remittances, claiming more than 12% of the world's remittances in 2007. Remittances to India account for approximately 3% of the country's GDP.
Since 1991, India has experienced sharp remittance growth. In 1991 Indian remittances totaled 2.1 billion USD; in 2006, they were estimated at between $22 billion and $25.7 billion. In 2006, remittances from Indian migrants overseas made up $27 billion or about 3% of India's GDP.

Gaius the Platonist

Gaius the Platonist (2nd century) was a Greek or Roman philosopher, and a representative of Middle Platonism. Very little is known about him except that he was the teacher of Albinus, who is known to have published a now lost nine-volume summary of Gaius' lectures on Plato. He taught Platonism in the first half of the 2nd century, but almost nothing is known about his philosophical opinions. It has been speculated that the "On Plato and His Doctrine" written by Apuleius may have been taken from the lectures of Gaius, but this assertion is now seen as dubious. It has also been thought that the anonymous commentary on the "Theaetetus" of Plato, which is partially extant, may have come from his school. Porphyry mentions that his works were read in the school of Plotinus.

<doc id="21627527" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21627527" title="Hypovitaminosis A">
Hypovitaminosis A

Hypovitaminosis A (also known as Follicular Hyperkeratosis and "Phrynoderma" which means Toad Skin) is common in children in the developing world, most often associated with diseases of fat malabsorption.
It is seen as rough, hyperkeratotic, follicular papules on the skin of elbows and knees.
Terminology.
The term "phrynoderma" was coined by Nicholls in 1933 to describe the "toad-like" appearance of the skin of undernourished labourers. 
Signs and Symptoms.
Adjunctive symptoms, such as cheilitis, glossitis, blepharitis, night blindness, diarrhea, muscle weakness and neuritis, may develop when hypovitaminosis A is predominant relative to other vitamin deficiencies.
The lesions could be discrete, keratotic, follicular, pigmented or skin colored, acuminate papules in all patients.Epidermal hyperkeratosis, follicular hyperkeratosis, and follicular plugging will be present in almost all the patients or very few of the above specified in some of the patients.
Causes.
Deficiencies of vitamins A and E, B complex vitamins, and essential fatty acids have all been implicated in the etiology of follicular hyperkeratosis.
Phrynoderma is a form of follicular hyperkeratosis that is associated with nutritional deficiencies. It is endemic to poor populations but is rare in developed countries. 
In developed countries, phrynoderma most often occurs as a result of malabsorption due to surgical or medical causes, such as small-bowel bypass surgery, colectomy and pancreatic insufficiency. However, phrynoderma can also develop if a patient follows a calorie-restricted diet (< 700 kcal/d) and strictly avoids vegetables, fruit and fats. However some studies have showed that phrynoderma could be hereditary.
Treatment.
Health care providers should be attentive to the nutritional needs of patients at risk for malnutrition, including those who have been prescribed a strict weight-loss regimen and those who may be in a malabsorptive state, such as patients who have undergone bariatric surgery. For these patients, health care providers should recommend diets, or at least supplements, that are rich in vitamins A, B, C and E, including foods such as yellow vegetables, green leafy vegetables, carrots, whole-milk derivatives, eggs, fish and oils (e.g., fish-liver oil, soybean oil, safflower oil, sunflower oil, corn oil, palm oil, cottonseed oil), as well as unprocessed cereal grains and nuts. 
However they must consult a dermatologist.

Joris Pieters van den Broeck

Joris Pieters van den Broeck (1610 – 27 August 1652) was a Frisian sailor in the service of the Admiralty of Friesland.
Service.
In the days before the Battle of the Downs, Maarten Harpertszoon Tromp had chosen a position off the coast near Dunkirk. De Broeck was one of his captains on this occasion, commanding the 67-man, 10-gun Frisian roeifregat "Rotterdam", and he was sent by Tromp to investigate the Spanish fleet reported at La Coruña. On receiving Broeck's report on it, Tromp decided to attack and in the ensuing battle Broeck was sent to Calais to bring back new supplies of gunpowder to the Dutch fleet. Having done so, Broeck rejoined the fleet and managed to capture a 140-man 18-gun Spanish galleon.
On 18 October 1640 he captured an 8-gun 72-man Dunkirker frigate and sail it back into Dokkum, followed in May 1642 by his capture of some small Dunkirker vessels and an 80-man 12-gun Dunkirker frigate. In August 1642 he forced a 14-gun enemy frigate to run aground and captured a 140-man 20-gun frigate. In the battle of Plymouth on 26 August 1652 he commanded the "De Westergo" in the squadron of Michiel de Ruyter (and was, apart from de Ruyter, the highest-ranking officer present), but he died in the evening after the battle of disease.

Unfairness doctrine

The unfairness doctrine is a doctrine in United States trade regulation law under which the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) can declare a business practice “unfair” because it is oppressive or harmful to consumers even though the practice is not an antitrust violation, an incipient antitrust violation, a violation of the “spirit” of the antitrust laws, or a deceptive practice. 
The doctrine was first authoritatively recognized in "FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson Trading Stamp Co.", although earlier Supreme Court decisions had suggested it in "obiter dicta".
The FTC has on occasion invoked the doctrine against oppressive practices that were not antitrust violations and not recognizably deceptive practices, such as the use of the holder in due course rule by retailers catering to the very poor and the practice of mail-order sellers suing consumers in states remote from where they live. The FTC has recently invoked the doctrine against Spyware.

Vitamin B6 excess

Vitamin B6 excess (also known as "pyridoxine excess") may present with a subepidermal vesicular dermatosis and sensory peripheral neuropathy.
Neurological symptoms.
Adverse effects have only been documented from vitamin B6 supplements and never from food sources. This article only discusses the safety of the common supplemental form of vitamin B6 pyridoxine (for a full discussion please see pyridoxine). Toxicologic animal studies identify specific destruction of the dorsal root ganglia which is documented in human cases of overdosage of pyridoxine. Although vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin and is excreted in the urine, doses of pyridoxine in excess of the RDI over long periods of time thus result in painful and ultimately irreversible neurological problems.
The primary symptoms are pain and numbness of the extremities, and in severe cases difficulty walking. Sensory neuropathy typically develops at doses of pyridoxine in excess of 1,000 mg per day. However, there have been a few case reports of individuals who developed sensory neuropathies at doses of less than 500 mg daily over a period of months. None of the studies, in which an objective neurological examination was performed, found evidence of sensory nerve damage at intakes of pyridoxine below 200 mg/day.
This condition is usually reversible when supplementation is stopped.
Existing authorisations and valuations vary considerably worldwide. In 1993 the European Community Scientific Committee on Food defines intakes of 50 mg vitamin B6 per day as harmful and established tolerable upper intake level of 25 mg/day for adults in 2000.
The Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals of the Food Standard Agency UK (UK EVM) derived a safe upper level (SUL) of 10 mg/day for a 60 kg adult in 2003.
The tolerable upper limit has been set by the US FDA at 100 mg/day in 2000.
The nutrient reference values in Australia and New Zealand recommend an upper limit of 50 mg a day in adults. "The same figure was set for pregnancy and lactation as there is no evidence of teratogenicity at this level. The UL was set based on metabolic body size and growth considerations for all other ages and life stages except infancy. It was not possible to set a UL for infants, so intake is recommended in the form of food, milk or formula." "The ULs were set using results of studies involving long-term oral administration of pyridoxine at doses of less than 1g/day (Berger & Schaumburg 1984, Bernstein & Lobitz 1988, Dalton 1985, Dalton & Dalton 1987, Del Tredici et al 1985, FNB:IOM 1998, Parry & Bredesen 1985). A NOAEL of 200 mg/day was identified from the studies of Bernstein & Lobitz (1988) and Del Tredici et al (1985). These studies involved subjects who had generally been on the supplements for 5 to 6 months or less. The study of Dalton and Dalton (1987), however, suggested that symptoms might take substantially longer than this to appear. In this latter retrospective survey, subjects who reported symptoms had been on supplements for 2.9 years on average. Those reporting no symptoms had taken supplements for 1.9 years."
Because there have been no placebo-controlled studies showing therapeutic benefits of high doses of pyridoxine, and the well documented occurrence of significant toxic effects there is little reason to exceed the RDI using supplements unless under medical supervision e.g. in treatment of primary hyperoxaluria.

Natural resources of India

Natural resources are utilisable materials derived from the environment. Resources are classified as either biotic or abiotic on the basis of their origin. The Indian landmass contains a multitude of both types of resource and its economy, especially in rural areas, is heavily dependent on their consumption or export. Due to overconsumption, such as uncontrolled logging or overfishing, many valuable natural resources are rapidly being depleted.
General.
The total cultivable area in India is 1,269,19 km² (56.78% of its total land area), which is shrinking due to population pressures and rapid urbanisation. India has a total water surface area of 360,400 km² and receives an average annual rainfall of 1,100 mm. Irrigation accounts for 92% of the water utilisation, comprising an area of 380 km² in 1974. It is expected to rise to 1,050 km² by 2025, with the balance accounted for by industrial and domestic consumers. India's inland water resources include rivers, canals, ponds and lakes, coupled with the east and west coasts of the Indian ocean and other gulfs and bays. These provide employment to nearly 6 million people in the fisheries sector. In 2008, India had the world's third largest fishing industry.
India produces 4 fuels, 11 metallic, 52 non-metallic and 22 minor minerals. India's major mineral resources include Coal (4th largest reserves in the world), Iron ore, Manganese ore (7th largest reserve in the world as in 2013), Mica, Bauxite (5th largest reserve in the world as in 2013), Chromite, Natural gas, Diamonds, Limestone and Thorium (world's largest along Tamil Nadus shores). India's oil reserves, found in Bombay High off the coast of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and in eastern Assam meet 25% of the country's demand.
A national level agency National Natural Resources Management System (NNRMS) was established in 1983 for integrated natural resources management in the country. It is supported by Planning Commission (India) and Department of Space.
Biotic resources.
Biotic resources are obtained from the living and organic material. These include forest products, wildlife, crops and other living organisms. Most of these resources are renewable because they can regenerate themselves. Fossil fuels are considered as biotic because they are formed from decayed organic matter. Fossil fuels are non-renewable.
Forestry.
India's land area includes regions with high rainfall to dry deserts, Coast line to Alpine regions. Around 21 percent of the total geographical area consists of Forests. Due to variations in climatic conditions and differences in altitude, different types of Forest are present in India including Tropical, Swamps, Mangrove and Alpine. Variety of forest vegetation is large. Forests are the main source of Fire woods, Paper, Spices, Drugs, Herbs, Gums and more. Forests contribute significant amount to nation's GDP.
Fishing.
India has a long history in fishing and aquaculture. India has rich marine and inland water resources. It has an 8129 km long coastline. Inland fishery is carried out in Rivers, Reservoirs and Lakes. In Indian rivers more than 400 species of fish are found and many species are economically important. Shrimps, Sardines, Mackerels, Carangids, Croakers and other varieties are available. Major Fish species available are Carp, Catfish, Murrel and Weed fish. India is one of the major marine fish producer. In 2012-2013, 9 Lakh tonnes of Marine products was exported.
Coal.
Coal mining in India started in 1774 through East India Company in the Raniganj Coalfield along the Western bank of Damodar River in the Indian State of West Bengal . Growth of the Indian coal mining started when steam locomotives were introduced in 1853. Production increased to Million tonnes. Production reached 30 million tonnes in 1946. After Independence, National Coal Development Corporation was set up and colleries were owned by Railways. India consumes coal mainly for Power sector. Other industries like cement, fertilizer, chemical and paper rely coal for energy requirements.
Oil.
India had about 125 Million metric tonne of proven oil reserves as April 2010 or 5.62 billion barrels as per EIA estimate for 2009, which is the second-largest amount in the Asia-Pacific region behind China. Most of India's crude oil reserves are located in the western coast (Mumbai High) and in the northeastern parts of the country, although considerable undeveloped reserves are also located in the offshore Bay of Bengal and in the state of Rajasthan. The combination of rising oil consumption and fairly unwavering production levels leaves India highly dependent on imports to meet the consumption needs. In 2010, India produced an average of about 33.69 million metric tonne of crude oil as on April 2010 or 877 thousand barrels per day as per EIA estimate of 2009. During 2006, India consumed an estimated of oil. The EIA estimates that India registered oil demand growth of during 2006. As of 2013 India Produces 30% of India's resources mostly in rajasthan.
India’s oil sector is dominated by state-owned enterprises, although the government has taken steps in past recent years to deregulate the hydrocarbons industry and support greater foreign involvement. India’s state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation is the largest oil company. ONGC is the leading player in India’s upstream sector, accounting for roughly 75% of the country’s oil output during 2006, as per Indian government estimates. As a net importer of all oil, the Indian Government has introduced policies aimed at growing domestic oil production and oil exploration activities. As part of the effort, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas crafted the New Exploration License Policy (NELP) in 2000, which permits foreign companies to hold 100% equity possession in oil and natural gas projects. However, to date, only a handful of oil fields are controlled by foreign firms. India’s downstream sector is also dominated by state-owned entities, though private companies have enlarged their market share in past recent years.
Natural gas.
As per the Ministry of petroleum, Government of India, India has of confirmed natural gas reserves as of April 2010. A huge mass of India’s natural gas production comes from the western offshore regions, particularly the Mumbai High complex. The onshore fields in Assam, Andhra Pradesh, and Gujarat states are also major producers of natural gas. As per EIA data, India produced of natural gas in 2004. India imports small amounts of natural gas. In 2004, India consumed about of natural gas, the first year in which the country showed net natural gas imports. During 2004, India imported of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.
As in the oil sector, India’s state-owned companies account for the bulk of natural gas production. ONGC and India Ltd. (OIL) are the leading companies with respect to production volume, while some foreign companies take part in upstream developments in joint-ventures and production sharing contracts. Industries, a privately owned Indian company, will also have a bigger role in the natural gas sector as a result of a large natural gas find in 2002 in the Krishna Godavari basin.
The Authority of India Ltd.|GAIL holds an effective control on natural gas transmission and allocation activities. In December 2006, the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas issued a new policy that allows foreign investors, private domestic companies, and Government oil companies to hold up to 100% equity stakes in pipeline projects. While GAIL’s domination in natural gas transmission and allocation is not ensured by statute, it will continue to be the leading player in the sector because of its existing natural gas infrastructure.
Abiotic resources.
Abiotic resources are obtained from the non-living and non-organic material. Some of the resources like Water and Air are Renewable. Other resources like Minerals are Non-renewable and exhaustible because they cannot be regenerated. Minerals can be categorized as Metallic, Non-Metallic and Minor minerals.
Metallic minerals.
Metallic minerals are the minerals which contain one or more metallic elements. They occur in rare, naturally formed concentrations known as mineral deposits. Metallic minerals available from India are Zinc, Iron ore, Manganese ore, Gold, Bauxite, Silver, Lead, Tin, Copper and Chromite.
Copper.
Copper has been used since ancient times. Details of Copper mining and metallurgy are available in ancient works like Arthashastra. Copper is mainly used in Industrial applications, Electrical/Electronic equipments and Consumer products such as utensils. Major resources of Copper are available at Rajasthan, Madhya pradesh and Jharkand. As on 2010, India had 1.56 billion tonnes of Copper ore. India is one of the 20 major Copper producers. In 2008, India produced 7,10,000 tonnes of copper. Hindustan Copper Limited, a public sector company is the only producer of primary refined copper. Post-pillar method and Blast hole stoping method are used for Mining. Some of the domestic demand is met through scrap recycling. In India, Copper scrap is recycled through Direct melting, which is a hazardous process.
Zinc.
Zinc is a bluish-white, lustrous, diamagnetic metal. It is also a fair conductor of electricity. References to medicinal uses of zinc are present in the Charaka Samhita.
Ancient Zinc smelting technique was found at a zinc production site in Zawar, Rajasthan. Zinc is recovered from a number of different zinc ores. The types of zinc ores include sulfide, carbonate, silicate and oxide. It is used in corrosive resistant coating for Iron and Steel. Also used in Automotive, Electrical and Machinery industries. India is the World's fourth largest Zinc reserve as in 2013. Hindustan Zinc Limited is the main producer of Zinc in India. Most of the resources are available in Rajasthan.

The minerals in Aluminium-garnet group are Almandine, Grossularite, Pyrope, and Spessartine. The mineral in Iron-garnet group is Andradite. The mineral in Chromium-garnet group is Uvarovite. Garnet group minerals occur in different rock types. It is a hard substance. It is resistant to chemical exposure. Used as an Semi-precious stone and also in Abrasives, Sand blasting, Water filtration materials and Water jet cutting. Garnets are available in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Kerala, Orissa, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. It is also found in beach sands of Kerala, Orissa and Tamil Nadu states. In 2007-08, India produced 8,73,000 tonnes.
Wollastonite.
It is a meta-silicate of Calcium. It is mostly white in color and occurs as bladed or needle like crystals. As on 2010, India had 16 million tonnes of resource. Most of the deposits are available in Rajasthan (Dungarpur, Pali, Sirohi and Udaipur districts). Minor amount of deposits are found in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. It is mainly used in Ceramic industries and Metallurgical applications. It is also used as a filler in Wall tiles, Paint, Rubber and Plastic. India is one of the largest reserves. In 2010, India produced 1,45,000 tons. It is mined by opencast method. It is also used as a substitute for short-fibre asbestos in brake-linings. Central Building Research Institute has found that Wollastonite can be used as substitute for chrysotile asbestos in cement products.
Sillimanite group.
It is a group of metamorphic minerals - Sillimanite, Kyanite and Andalusite. These are polymorphs of Alumino-Silicate. These are formed under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. The three minerals are calcined to form Mullite. Mainly used as refractory materials. 
As on 2010, India had 66 million tonnes of Sillimanite, 100 million tonnes of Kyanite and 18 million tonnes of Andalusite as resource.

Per Bratland

Per Bratland (1907–1988) was a Norwegian newspaper editor.
Born in Oslo, he started out as a photo reporter for the Drammen newspaper Fremtiden in 1927. He became the editor-in-chief of "Tiden" in 1934, and a journalist in "Arbeiderbladet" in 1936. He covered the arrival of Adolf Hitler in Vienna in March 1938, and the nazi annexation of Austria, as news reporter, escaping to Tsjekkoslovakia by taxi, with his undeveloped film hidden in the petrol tank.
When the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany started in 1940, "Arbeiderbladet" was shut down. Escaping the invasion army, Bratland took a famous photo of king Haakon VII and crown prince Olav, hiding in the birch forest in Molde, under a bombing raid by German airplanes. He escaped Aalesund by sea to Bodø, crossed the border to Sweden on ski, and presented his news photoes from the war in Norway in Stockholm. His story and the photographs he presented there of bombed Norwegian cities, contradicted the impression created by German media, of a peaceful occupation. He returned to Norway through Finland, but arriving in Oslo, the nazi administration blacklisted him from work as a journalist. Later that year, Bratland fled the country again, and worked at the press office of the Norwegian legation in Stockholm from 1940 to 1941 and in London from 1941 to 1945.
After the war he created and edited the magazine "Aktuell" from 1945 to 1956. He then worked in "Arbeiderbladet" from 1956 to 1975, except for the years 1959 to 1961, when he was the editor-in-chief of "Bergens Arbeiderblad". He published several books in Norwegian: Hvem har makt i Norge (1965), Bratteli tenker høyt (1968) and Er vi slik? (1971).

Bezbozhnik (magazine)

Bezbozhnik (; "Atheist" or "The Godless") was a monthly anti-religious and atheistic satirical magazine, published in the Soviet Union between 1922 and 1941 by the League of Militant Atheists. Between 1923 and 1931, there was also a daily newspaper called Bezbozhnik u Stanka (Безбожник у станка; "The Godless at the Workplace"). Its first issue was published in December 1922, with a print run of 15,000, but its circulation reached as much as 200,000 in 1932.
History.
Initially, the publication ridiculed all religious belief as being a sign of ignorance and superstition, while claiming that the religion was dying in the officially atheist Soviet Union, with reports of closing churches, unemployed priests and ignored religious holidays. Starting with the mid-1920s, the soviet government saw religion as an economic threat to the peasantry, whom, it said, were being oppressed by the clergy.
Its main targets were Christianity and Judaism, accusing rabbis and priests of collaborating with the bourgeoisie and other counter-revolutionaries ("see White movement"). The rabbis were accused of promoting hostility between Jews and Gentiles. "Bezbozhnik" alleged that some rabbis in the tsarist government's pay had helped organize anti-Jewish pogroms, while claiming that such actions had sparked similar atrocities in England, South Africa and other countries.
Priests were attacked as being parasites who lived off the work of the peasants. It reported of priests who allegedly admitted deceiving peasants and who supposedly renounced their profession. For instance, it ran a story about a certain Sergei Tomilin, who allegedly claimed 150 kilograms of wheat and 21 metres of linen for each marriage he conducted, performing over 30 marriages in just a few weeks and thus receiving the wage a schoolteacher would have earned in 10 years.
The magazine criticized the Jewish holiday of Passover as encouraging excessive drinking, because of the requirement of drinking four glasses of wine, while Prophet Elijah was accused of being an alcoholic who got "drunk as a swine".
Writer Mikhail Bulgakov once visited the offices of the "Bezbozhnik" and got a set of back numbers. He was shocked by its content, not only by what he saw as "boundless blasphemy", but also by its claims, such as that Jesus Christ was a rogue and a scoundrel. Bulgakov believed that this was "a crime beyond measure".
Bezbozhnik used humour as part of its anti-religious atheist propaganda, since humour was able to reach both educated and barely literate audiences. For example, in 1924, "Bezbozhnik u Stanka" issued a brochure called "How to Build a Godless Corner", a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Eastern Orthodox Icon Corner. The brochure included a set of two big posters with anti-religious slogans, seven other smaller humoristic posters, six back issues from "Bezbozhnik u Stanka", from which to cut other images and instructions on how to assemble it. Such corners were suggested to be made at workplaces and the owner was encouraged to spend time at them and to try to convert other workers.
By the 1930s, the "Bezbozhnik" began to stray away from its original subject, anti-religion and atheism and it began publishing more general political subjects. "Bezbozhnik" was closed down in 1941, during World War II and the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany.

Finance in India

More than half of personal savings are invested in physical assets such as land, houses, cattle, and gold.
The Indian money market is classified into: the organised sector (comprising private, public and foreign owned commercial banks and cooperative banks, together known as "scheduled banks"); and the unorganised sector (comprising individual or family owned indigenous bankers or money lenders and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs)). The unorganised sector and microcredit are still preferred over traditional banks in rural and sub-urban areas, especially for non-productive purposes, like ceremonies and short duration loans.
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi nationalised 14 banks in 1969, followed by six others in 1980, and made it mandatory for banks to provide 40% of their net credit to priority sectors like agriculture, small-scale industry, retail trade, small businesses, etc. to ensure that the banks fulfill their social and developmental goals. Since then, the number of bank branches has increased from 10,120 in 1969 to 98,910 in 2003 and the population covered by a branch decreased from 63,800 to 15,000 during the same period. The total deposits increased 32.6 times between 1971 to 1991 compared to 7 times between 1951 to 1971. Despite an increase of rural branches, from 1,860 or 22% of the total number of branches in 1969 to 32,270 or 48%, only 32,270 out of 500,000 villages are covered by a scheduled bank.
Since liberalisation, the government has approved significant banking reforms. While some of these relate to nationalised banks (like encouraging mergers, reducing government interference and increasing profitability and competitiveness), other reforms have opened up the banking and insurance sectors to private and foreign players.
As of 2007, banking in India is generally mature in terms of supply, product range and reach-even, though reach in rural India still remains a challenge for the private sector and foreign banks. In terms of quality of assets and capital adequacy, Indian banks are considered to have clean, strong and transparent balance sheets relative to other banks in comparable economies of Asia. The Reserve Bank of India is an autonomous body, with minimal pressure from the government. The stated policy of the Bank on the Indian Rupee is to manage volatility but without any fixed exchange rate.

Birgit Nilsson Prize

The extraordinary Birgit Nilsson Prize of one million dollars, the largest given in the world of classical music, is awarded approximately every 3 years for outstanding achievements and major contributions to the field of opera/concert to a currently active singer (in the field of opera, concert, oratorio, or lieder); a currently active conductor (in the field of opera or concert); an institution with an outstanding record in opera or concert, such as an orchestra, a chorus, or an opera company (in the case of an opera company, specifically in recognition of an exceptional production that respects the spirit of the composer). 
Towards the end of her unparalleled, long and distinguished career, the legendary Swedish dramatic soprano Birgit Nilsson established the Birgit Nilsson Foundation exclusively to support this Prize. Being very concerned with the general decline of cultural values, in particular with the decline of performance standards in opera, and encountering much greater difficulties in the early years of her career than is generally known to the public, Birgit Nilsson believed that overcoming these difficulties motivated her and contributed to her future success. Along with honouring great artists and artistry, it was her hope in establishing this Prize to provide incentive and inspiration to young artists to sustain their efforts to reach full potential by planning their careers over the long term and to perpetuate the art form.
The philosophy behind the Birgit Nilsson Prize is to perpetuate the legacy of Ms. Nilsson and Sweden’s great operatic tradition by paying tribute to today’s outstanding, active figures in music, recognizing the excellence of their work and their major contributions. 
Winners.
Birgit Nilsson personally chose the first prize-winner and put the chosen name in a sealed envelope to be opened three years after her death, which was on Christmas Day 2005. The envelope was opened in February 2009 and the first laureate, who received the award, was the opera tenor and conductor Plácido Domingo.
Plácido Domingo’s worldwide career is legendary - singing 130 different roles, more than any other tenor in history. Domingo’s musicality is confirmed by his extraordinary repertoire and singing career as well as his accomplishments as a conductor, administrator, humanitarian, and creator of young artist programs and competitions.
In 2011, the second laureate, conductor Riccardo Muti, was selected by a distinguished international panel of classical music experts from the major countries where Birgit Nilsson was most active during her career. Cited for his "extraordinary contributions in opera and concert, as well as his enormous influence in the music world both on and off the stage."
The Birgit Nilsson Prize for 2014 will be awarded to the Vienna Philharmonic, which is being recognized for its extraordinary contributions during its 172 years of work in opera and concert, as well as for its enormous worldwide influence in the music world both on and off the stage through live performance, recordings, and other media.
Jury.
The panel members, who are appointed by and work with the Foundation’s board and who serve for a period of three years, have remained the same for 2011 and 2014. They are: 
Award Ceremony.
The first and second award ceremony of the Birgit Nilsson Prize took place at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm. On the very stage where Birgit Nilsson made her debut, King Carl Gustaf of Sweden presented the Prize personally to star tenor, conductor and opera house director Plácido Domingo as well as to Maestro Riccardo Muti, the 2011 Prize laureate.
The Birgit Nilsson Prize for 2014 will be awarded to the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra at the Konserthuset in Stockholm, Sweden on October 8, 2014.

Confederate Army of Kentucky

The Army of Kentucky was a Confederate army during the American Civil War. 
The designation "Army of Kentucky" was given August 25, 1862 to the field army Kirby Smith led into eastern Kentucky during the Confederate Heartland Offensive. The army was drawn from troops of the Confederate Department of Eastern Tennessee, which had been created with Smith as commander in February 1862.
The army consisted of the infantry divisions of Henry Heth, Patrick Cleburne, Thomas J. Churchill and Carter L. Stevenson and two small cavalry brigades under John Morgan and John S. Scott. After the Battle of Perryville, Kirby Smith was promoted and given command of the Department of Trans-Mississippi, and army was incorporated into the Army of Tennessee.

<doc id="21627783" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21627783" title="Colleges of Durham University">
Colleges of Durham University

This is a list of the colleges within Durham University. These colleges are the primary source of accommodation for undergraduates and graduates at the University, also providing bursaries and scholarships to students. They also provide funding and/or accommodation for some of the research posts in the University.
Durham University has 16 colleges, of which University College is the oldest, founded in 1832. The newest college is Josephine Butler, founded in 2006. The last single sex college, St Mary's, became mixed in 2005 with the admittance of male undergraduates. One college, Ustinov, admits only postgraduates.
Colleges.
Durham operates a collegiate structure similar to that of the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, in that all the colleges at Durham are "listed bodies" under the Education Reform Act, 1988, "recognised by the UK authorities as being able to offer courses leading to a degree of a recognised body" (the "recognised body" being, in this case, the federal University). Though most of the Durham colleges are governed and owned directly by the University itself, and so do not enjoy the independence of colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, the status of the Durham colleges is similar to those in Oxford and Cambridge and the constituent institutions of the University of Wales, setting Durham colleges apart from those at the universities of Kent, Lancaster, and York. However, unlike at Oxford, Cambridge, Wales, and London, there is no formal teaching at most Durham colleges (although St John's and St Chad's have their own academic and research staff and offer college-based programmes in conjunction with the University). The colleges dominate the residential, social, sporting, and pastoral functions within the university, and there is heavy student involvement in their operation.
Formal dinners (known as "formals") are held at many colleges; gowns are often worn to these events. There is a great deal of intercollegiate rivalry, particularly in rowing and other sporting activities. There is also rivalry between the older colleges of the Bailey and the newer colleges of the Hill.
Types of college.
The University is collegiate in structure. There are four different sorts of college: Maintained Colleges and Societies, Recognised Colleges, Licensed Halls of Residence, and Affiliated Colleges.
List of colleges.
Most of the colleges located in Durham itself can be grouped into two areas of the city. Bailey colleges are those located on the peninsula formed by a meander of the River Wear, and Hill colleges are on Elvet Hill on the other side of the river. Queen's Campus, Stockton, is south of Durham, in the town of Stockton-on-Tees.
The student numbers in the table below are up to date for the 2010/11 year.
"U = Undergraduates, P = Postgraduates, F = Female, M = Male"
Heads of Houses.
The senior member of each college is an officer known generically as the Head of House. His or her specific title varies from college to college as indicated in the list below, but there is no particular significance to the variation. The Heads of House of the maintained colleges are also half-time members of an academic department.
Former Colleges.
A number of colleges that that have been part of the University of Durham, Durham, England, but have since folded or cancelled their association with the university.
Durham University currently recognises sixteen colleges. However, since its foundation in 1832, a number of other colleges have been part of the university. Two of these have become completely defunct; others have ended their association with the university, or left to become independent institutions of their own.
Bishop Cosin's Hall.
Cosin's Hall on Palace Green was opened as the university's third college in 1851. However, the university was unable to sustain three colleges at the time, and it was merged into University College in 1864. University College maintained offices and rooms in the Hall until 2006. It is still owned by the university and has been used by the Institute of Advanced Study since January 2007.
Neville's Cross College.
Neville's Cross College was opened in 1921. It was primarily a teacher-training college; but from 1924 it was also a recognised college of the University and admitted students to read for both undergraduate courses and postgraduate degrees. The College merged with Durham Technical College in 1977 to form New College Durham, whereupon it ceased to be associated with the University.
Ushaw College.
Ushaw College was a Catholic seminary located in Ushaw Moor, a village to the west of Durham. It was opened in 1808 by scholars who had fled from Douai, France, when English College was forced to close during the French Revolution. It affiliated with Durham as 'Licensed Hall' in 1968, though it retained its role primarily as a seminary. It shut in 2011 due to a declining number of vocations in the Catholic Church. Its buildings are set to be occupied for two years from April 2012 by Durham Business School, whilst its own site is redeveloped.
Colleges in Newcastle.
In 1852, the School of Medicine and Surgery (founded in 1834) in Newcastle upon Tyne was absorbed into the University of Durham as the College of Medicine, allowing students to study for the Licence in Medicine in Durham, after which students could practise Medicine and take the degrees of Bachelor and Doctor in Medicine. At the same time, Neville Hall was opened in Newcastle 'for the reception of Students in Medicine'. The Hall closed at the end of the academic year in 1855/56. In 1871, the College of Medicine was joined by the College of Physical Science, later renamed Armstrong College.
Relations between the two campuses were often strained. They became two autonomous parts of the same university, with the Newcastle colleges merging to become King's College in 1937. In 1947 a proposal to rename the university as the "University of Durham and Newcastle" was approved by all the governing bodies, but was defeated at convocation by 135 votes to 129 in the spring of 1952. This defeat led to King's College eventually leaving the university, to create the new University of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1963.
Colleges abroad.
Durham University has had two affiliated colleges outside of England. Of these, Fourah Bay College is a former part of the university, having ended its affiliation in 1967. It became a constituent college of the University of Sierra Leone on that date. The other affiliate, Codrington College, retains its links to the University.
Renamed and merged colleges.
The College of St Hild and St Bede was formed from the merger of two separate colleges in 1975. The College of the Venerable Bede (usually known as Bede College) had been an all male college formed in 1838, with St Hild's College formed as an all female college in 1858. Prior to this merger and their full integration into the university, the two colleges had previously specialised in the teaching of education.
A few other groupings have undergone renaming during their time at Durham. The Graduate Society became a full college in 2003 and was subsequently renamed Ustinov College.
George Stephenson (now simply Stephenson College) and John Snow College became separate colleges in 2001. They are located at Stockton-on-Tees and originally founded as the "Joint University College on Teesside of the Universities of Durham and Teesside (JUCOT)". When the University of Teesside pulled out of the campus in 1996 they became a full college of Durham University known as "University College, Stockton" before they later split and gained their new names.
Fictitious colleges.
Jesus College and Coverdale Hall are the settings for the events in "Angels and Men", Durham alumna Catherine Fox's first novel (published by Hamish Hamilton in 1996). The location is nowhere stated explicitly, but it is obvious to anyone familiar with the city and the university that it takes place in Durham; Jesus and Coverdale are modelled (very closely) on St John's College and Cranmer Hall.
"That Hideous Strength" (1943) by C. S. Lewis is set in a fictional university town, whose resemblance to Durham is close enough to require Lewis to insist in the book's preface that it is not so.

<doc id="21627807" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21627807" title="Form 696">
Form 696

Form 696 is a risk assessment form which the London Metropolitan Police requests promoters and licensees of events to complete and submit 14 days in advance of an event in 21 London boroughs. Non compliance with this may result in police opposition to event licenses being granted. This form has become controversial due to its stipulation that names, stage names, private addresses, and phone numbers of all promoters, DJs and artists be listed. The form also asks for a description of the style of music to be performed and the target audience. The original form asked for details of ethnic groups likely to attend the performance, but that version was revised to omit those parameters in December 2008.
Opposition.
Feargal Sharkey, Head of UK Music and former lead singer of The Undertones, gave evidence to the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee in November 2008 stating that "We learned that the Metropolitan Police, in conjunction with an organization called London Councils - a representative body for all London borough - at the end of last year jointly wrote to all 33 local London boroughs recommending that they insert some particular wording into their local licensing policy statements." He added that the London Borough of Hillingdon in west London, "tries to make a direct connection not only between crime and disorder and live music, but most astonishingly - I'm still knocked over in disbelief - between live music and the prevention of terrorism." Sharkey stated that he would be seeking a Judicial Review on the use of the form and had complained to the Equality and Human Rights Commission about the targeting of musical styles favoured by black and Asian teenagers. According to Sharkey an afternoon school charity concert in a public park had been cancelled because organisers could not supply the details of the young performers.
Jon McClure, lead singer with Reverend and the Makers, set up a petition on the UK Prime Minister's website to allow protest against what he alleges as "racial discrimination".
In a statement on their web site, The British Academy of Composers and Songwriters CEO Patrick Rackow stated "...the imposition of Form 696 on live music is likely to discourage the existence and growth of live music. Music has long been a positive form of free expression, for people from all walks of life to create and enjoy. This form appears to single out certain genres of music and ethnic audiences and therefore the Academy cannot support it.”
In December 2008, Mike Howlett, Chairman of the Music Producers Guild (UK), wrote to the General Secretary of the Musicians Union "In keeping with the Musicians Union and UK Music, we feel this is a gross infringement of civil liberties and a form of racial discrimination. We also feel that this will deter the staging of live musical events, stifle free expression and possibly penalise certain genres of music and ethnic audiences. Our members are horrified that this legislation, introduced in 2006, is being enforced under the guise of public law and order. We see no reason why artists and/or venue owners and managers should be forced to comply."
Police position.
David Isles, Detective Superintendent of the Metropolitan Police Clubs and Vice unit has stated that Form 696 is not designed to stop people having a good time. The Metropolitan Police web site describes the form as a "Promotion Event risk assessment form".
Detective Chief Superintendent Richard Martin stated that the original form, with its questions relating to audience ethnicity "was removed just because I don't think it added any value to the form... We take account of where the event is playing, what other events might be playing nearby, the type of music that's being played, and whether there have been problems before. We've had quite a few of what I consider 'higher risk events', where there may be some problems - so we recommend additional searching processes and additional security to help manage the event safely." "It's not about being risk averse, it's about managing the risk," he said. "If you're a publican and you are just having some performers to entertain your regular customers, you won't be expected to do a risk assessment. It's for when the performance is being put on to draw people in. We will never assess somebody just on the genre of music they are performing. There is a whole raft of factors that are taken into account."
Form revised.
In September 2009, the Metropolitan Police announced "that venues would no longer be asked for details of the music style. A requirement to provide the telephone number of the performing artist will also be dropped and an independent "scrutiny panel" will be set up to ensure that the form is not misused." Feargal Sharkey described this as an "exercise in semantics" and called for the form to be completely scrapped. He added that "it was clear that the altered version continued to target musicians from ethnic minorities and he objected strongly to a question which asks about the 'make-up of the patrons'."

St. Nicholas Fortress

St. Nicholas Fortress () is a fortress located in the town of Šibenik, one of the oldest native Croatian towns on the eastern shores of the Adriatic, in central Dalmatia, Croatia.
History.
In the town of Šibenik there are four fortresses:
Only St. Nicholas Fortress is at sea, at the entrance of Šibenik port, and the other three are on land.
St. Nicholas Fortress was built on the left side at the entrance of the St. Anthony "(Sv. Ante)" channel, on the island called "Ljuljevac", in front of the Šibenik port. St. Nicholas Fortress got its name from the Benedictine Monastery of St. Nicholas, which was on the island, but due to construction of the fortress had to be demolished. At the request of domestic Croat population of Šibenik, the Venetian captain Alojzije de Canal decided to build a fort on an island of Ljuljevac in 30 April 1525. Fortress was designed and built by the famous Venetian architect and builder Hyeronimus di San Michaela. It was built by in the 16th century to prevent Turkish boats from reaching the port. St. Nicholas Fortress was armed with 32 cannon. However, its imposing appearance and size were a bigger threat to the enemy than canons.
Architecture.
The fortress is one of the most valuable and best preserved examples of defense architecture in Dalmatia. The fortress is made of brick because this material was considered to be most resistant to cannon balls, while the foundations are made of stone. Although defense capabilities of the fortress have never been tested in military operations, the structure still proved successful in protecting the city from sea-bound enemy attacks. During the centuries of use, the structure served to various armies and has undergone a number of renovations, some of them made necessary because of the development of arms. It was completely abandoned by the military in 1979 and has been in renovation ever since.
Notes.
In the Mediterranean, there are two similar forts: one on the island of Malta, and the other is in Venice, and her name is Saint Nicholas.

During the rule of Charles V, the States of Zeeland was made up of prelates from the area (e.g. the abbot of the Onze Lieve Vrouwe Abdij in Middelburg), the main nobles of Zeeland (the Ridderschap) and representatives of the area's six largest cities (known as pensionaries). These cities were Middelburg, Zierikzee, Goes, Reimerswaal and Tholen (with Vlissingen and Veere added after the Dutch Revolt). Decisions were taken by majority vote and the body and area were represented at the States General of the Netherlands by the Grand Pensionary of Zeeland, with this regional states (like the others) also nominating Zeeland's members of the States-General. Its executive board was known as the Gecommitteerde Raden. From 1578, these, the Zeeuwse Admiraliteitscollege and other regional representatives oversaw the Admiralty of Zeeland.
Current composition.
Since the 2011 provincial elections, the seats of the States of Zeeland are as following:

Church covenant

The church covenant is a declaration, which some churches draw up and call their members to sign, in which their duties as church members towards God and their fellow believers are outlined. It is a fraternal agreement, freely endorsed, that establishes what are, according to the Holy Scriptures, the duties of a Christian and the responsibilities which each church member pledges himself or herself to honour, in the best way possible. A church covenant is not generally considered indispensable for a church. As such, in fact, it is not mentioned in the Scriptures, but it outlines, in a summarised way, those duties which the New Testament requires as members of a church.
History.
The idea of a church covenant is an expression of the free-church ecclesiology and it issues from within the context of the English Puritanism, becoming afterwards one of the characteristic traits of the Baptist churches.
In the 16th century, the Church in England, confronted with the teaching of the Bible under the impulse of continental Protestantism, engaged itself in a reformation which disconnected it from many persuasions, practices and traditions of Roman Catholicism. In particular, from the time of Henry VIII's divorce from Catherine of Aragon and subsequent marriage to Queen Anne Boleyn, it reflected on the meaning, structure and function of being a church and was involved in heated discussions on the measure according to which this reformation must occur.
To the end of the reign of Edward VI the model of the Reformed Genevan ecclesiology prevailed. After the parenthesis of Mary I, in which Roman Catholicism was restored, with Elizabeth I a line of compromise prevailed and lasted until the time of Charles I when, caused by the English Civil War, Calvinist Presbyterianism was reintroduced. With Charles II, the Elizabethan settlement was reconfirmed and again imposed a compromise line between Catholicism and Protestantism.
This Elizabethan compromise was opposed by many theologians and preachers who exerted considerable pressure so that, courageously, the church was finally purified from all Roman Catholic doctrines and practices unsupported by the Bible (from this the term Puritanism is mainly drawn). The resistance and refusal, nevertheless, of the institution to carry forward these reforms, considered by now unsupportable for the population, led some to force the situation and establish independent Christian congregations (from this the term Separatism is created) which, eventually will gave birth to the churches which are now known as Congregationalist and Baptist.
A new ecclesiology thus matured in this context. It was different from the traditional one, the one used to the concept of territorial churches subdivided in parishes, "people's church", confused and allied with the state and governed by clerical hierarchies (episcopacy). It was "the free-church ecclesiology", in which the church is mainly a free and voluntary local association of committed Christians, democratically self-managed, distinct and independent from the State. They are Christians bound one to the others on the basis of a covenant and affirming a Confession of faith. In the case of the Baptist movement, believers' baptism is understood as the seal of such a commitment towards God and one to the other. This movement, consequently, gets closer and closer to the doctrines and experiences first of the Anabaptists, then of Mennonites.
The concept of the church as God's people bound by a covenant, although not new in the history of Christianity, was developed extensively by the Strasbourg reformer Martin Bucer (1491–1551) and taken up in Puritanism by Richard Fitz (1570), who established in London by 1567 a Christian congregation separated from the officially sanctioned Anglican church. He expressed the aspiration, shared by many, to establish a church free from the State interference, characterised by what are understood by the signs of a true church: biblical preaching, New Testament sacraments, and ordered by a serious discipline. This church must be formed, Fitz wrote, on the basis of a voluntary covenant:
Robert Browne (1540–1630) theorized how God's faithful people are called to separate themselves from the unfaithful ones, and that the only way to form a true church is, for believers, to agree together in a covenant, the signing of which is expected by all those who wish to be part of it. This way God's people would submit to the authority of Christ, becoming a real church. Signing this contract would become the sign of the genuine Christian Henry Barrowe (1550–1593) took up and further elaborated on Browne's ideas, linking the local church covenant to the eternal covenant of God, emphasizing the consistent application of church discipline for those who infringe this covenant. In the Separatist Confession of Faith of 1596, article 33, the church is thus described:
Records being rather scarce, we do not know how much the separatist ideas in fact do influence John Smyth's thought, main inspirer of the Baptist movement in England. Through great part of his career, Smyth believes that a local church covenant is the most appropriate answer to God's offer of the covenant of grace. He writes "to be debtor, in these ideas, to the separatist "ancient brothers". Smyth declares that the true church members are "the saints only" and that these must convene in a local church through a fraternal covenant. From this perspectyive, Smyth has much in common with the Anabaptist persuasion that the best way to relate to God is through a community of believers. Later, as Smyth gets closer to the Mennonites, he does not any more emphasize this concept.
The idea of church covenant becomes prominent among the puritans that settle in America. In 1648, in Cambridge (Massachusetts) John Cotton, Richard Mather, e Ralph Partridge draw out "a model for the government of the church" in which the reasoning thus follows: "this visible union cannot be established by mere 'faith,' for that is invisible; nor by a 'bare profession' of faith, for that does not make a person part of one particular church or another; nor by 'cohabitation' (i.e., living in the same community), for "atheists and Infidels may dwell together with believers"; nor by "baptism," since baptism by itself does not make a person a part of a particular church. What establishes the visible union of a group of believers into a church is that they make a covenant with each other to be the church".
Relevance.
As the pluralist and religion-neutral state asserts itself in our society, it causes more and more the loss of the traditional concept of "people's church" where one or more churches are acknowledged as "official churches" and they enjoy of the support of the State.
All churches today are consequently "forced" to become, as a matter of fact, "free churches", namely free-will association of persons with common religious interests. Churches thus become not dissimilar from any other association organising itself after a common interest, with their own statutes and self-governed.
The natural evolution of our society is leading to a new reappraisal of the concept of church covenant, the document which establishes the rights and duties of those who are members of the church. We see, thus, a process of de-institutionalisation of all the churches, which may issue in a real "purification" from the evils and corruption which originally were the consequence of the act by which the Roman Emperor Constantine making Christianity " the religion of the state".
Signing of a church covenant indeed makes the church member more serious, committed and responsible concerning duties which, although established in the New Testament, can easily be neglected or delegated to others.

Bærum RK

Bærum Roklubb is a sports club from Bærum, Norway.
Established in 1917, its only sport is sport rowing. It is based at Kalvøya outside Sandvika, and has shared the current locality with the canoeing club Bærum KK since 1972. Bærum RK originally had its own house at Kalvøya, but this was moved to Kadettangen in 1925, and sold in 1936 due to financial problems. Between 1936 and 1972 the rowing club used a house constructed on the tiny islet Danmark. In 1972 the new clubhouse on Kalvøya was finished and both Bærum rowing club and Bærum KK moved into the new clubhouse. The house was burned to the ground during a fire in 1996, but a new club house was opened in May 2000.
Well-known members include Ole Nafstad, Svein Nielsen and Vetle Vinje.
It was founded by physician Peter Torgersen, who was a leading proponent of "useful sports", the notion that sports practice should come in useful on other fields in life. For Bærum RK, this meant that the rowers used regular rowing boats. Torgersen wanted men to be able to escape in lifeboats, should they be on board a "torpedoed Norwegian ship". The Norwegian Rowing Association was strictly against this.

Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture

In mathematics, Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture is a conjecture made by that the pair correlation between pairs of zeros of the Riemann zeta function (normalized to have unit average spacing) is
which, as Freeman Dyson pointed out to him, is the same as the pair correlation function of random Hermitian matrices. Informally, this means that the chance of finding a zero in a very short interval of length 2π"L"/log("T") at a distance 2π"u"/log("T") from a zero 1/2+"iT" is about "L" times the expression above. (The factor 2π/log("T") is a normalization factor that can be thought of informally as the average spacing between zeros with imaginary part about "T".) showed that the conjecture was supported by large-scale computer calculations of the zeros. The conjecture has been extended to correlations of more than 2 zeros, and also to zeta functions of automorphic representations . In 1982 a student of Montgomery's, Ali Erhan Özlük, "proved" the pair correlation conjecture for some of Dirichlet's L-functions.
The connection with random unitary matrices could lead to a proof of the Riemann hypothesis. The Hilbert–Pólya conjecture asserts that the zeros of the Riemann Zeta function correspond to the eigenvalues of a linear operator, and implies RH. Some people think this is a promising approach ().
Montgomery was studying the Fourier transform "F"("x") of the pair correlation function, and showed (assuming the Riemann hypothesis) that it was
equal to |"x"| for |"x"|<1. His methods were unable to determine it for |"x"|≥1, but he conjectured that it was equal to 1 for these "x", which implies that the pair correlation function is as above.
Numerical calculation by Odlyzko.
In the 1980s, motivated by the Montgomery's conjecture, Odlyzko began an intensive numerical study of the statistics of the zeros of ζ(s). He confirmed that the distribution of the spacings between non-trivial zeros using detail numerical calculation and demonstrated that the Montgomery's conjecture would be true and the distribution would agree with the distribution of spacings of GUE random matrics eigenvalues using Cray X-MP. In 1987 he reported them on the paper .
For non trivial zero, 1/2+iγn, let the normalized spacings be
Then we would expect the following formula as the limit, M, N →∞. Then
Based on a new algorithm developed by Odlyzko and Schönhage that allowed them to compute a value of ζ(1/2 + it) in an average time of tε steps, he computed millions of zeros at heights around 1020 and spectacularly confirmed the GUE conjecture.
The figure contains the first 105 non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. As more zeros are sampled the more closely their distribution approximates the shape of the GUE random matrix.

Jan Abrahamsz Beerstraaten (bapt. 1 March 1622, Amsterdam – buried in July 1666, Amsterdam?) was a Dutch painter of marine art and landscapes, particularly of events of the First Anglo-Dutch War and Dutch-Swedish War.
Biography.
There is some confusion about the identity of four landscape painters named Beerstraaten; Johannes, this Jan Abrahamsz, Abraham, and Anthonie. Jan Abrahamsz, painter, married in Amsterdam on August 30, 1642. From this marriage eleven children were born, and when he married a second time in 1665, a daughter was born. Currently, The RKD records Johannes as the same person, and Abraham Beerstraaten is considered to be his oldest son.
Anthonie Beerstraaten was related to this painter. The RKD has registered two paintings signed Anthonie van Beerstraten: one is a view of a southern seaport from 1664 (currently location Enkhuizen) and the other a view of a church in Aarlanderveen in the former city hall of Alphen aan de Rijn. Based on these two paintings C. Hofstede de Groot an early Dutch art historian, classified paintings signed A. Beerstraaten as by Anthonie if they were a poorer grade than ones already attributed to Abraham.

It is claimed that in 1904, Nutting constructed one of the earliest, if not the first, neon sign, which was displayed at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition; however, this story has been disputed.
In 1910, Nutting joined the staff of Eastman Kodak Company and was the author of the 1912 book "Outlines of Applied Optics", which called for an increased level of academic study in the applied optics field. In 1915, Nutting convened a series of meetings among Rochester, New York–based physicists that resulted in the founding of the OSA in January 1916.
