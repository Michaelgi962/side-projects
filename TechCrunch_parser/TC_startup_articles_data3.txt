Flipboard Cofounder Evan Doll Has Left The Company
2015/10/15
Cofounder Evan Doll is no longer at Flipboard, the company has confirmed to TechCrunch and has just announced in a blog post. He will be joining Redpoint Ventures as an entrepreneur-in-residence. His role as head of Flipboard’s head of client engineering will be taken over by Troy Brant, who has been handling the job lately. In addition to the blog post from CEO and co-founder Mike McCue, Doll has tweeted his own farewell. Thankful for the amazing team & company I've been able to build alongside @mmccue at @Flipboard over the past 6 yrs. https://t.co/iMAd1ANyji — Evan Doll (@edog1203) October 15, 2015  It looks like the departure is on fairly amicable terms: the internal memo published in the blog post mentions that it will toast Doll at the company’s Friday “Mock-o-Clock” meeting. Doll isn’t the only recent departure. Eric Feng, the company’s CTO, left earlier this week to re-join Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Feng spent 2 years at Flipboard before returning to the firm, which he left in 2011.

Doll’s departure comes at a tough time for Flipboard, The company earlier this year raised $50 million in a new financing round. But at the same time, it’s found itself dealing with stiff competition from services like Apple News. That’s also raised questions about whether Flipboard can remain an independent company, given rumors that Twitter might acquire the company, which cropped up earlier this year. At the time the company confirmed its funding round, Flipboard said it had 72 million monthly active users, with the vast majority of that coming from mobile devices. Earlier in July, it was reported that the company’s numbers had jumped 75 percent in the last six months to 70 million on the back of web-user growth. The company said it sees anywhere from 150,000 to 200,000 activations every day around the world. Before Flipboard, Doll was at Apple, where he was an engineer working on early models of the iPhone.

Passive Fitness Tracking App Human Is Now Much Easier On Your Battery
2015/10/15
Human has been relentlessly updating its passive activity tracking app for the past two years. But today’s update is the biggest to date with many under-the-hood improvements and new user-facing features. In particular, Human is now much easier on your battery and more accurate as well. The app now relies as much as possible on the motion coprocessor in your iPhone 5s, 6 or 6s. Human now has 50 percent less battery impact. And if you really need to get the most out of your phone, there is a new low power mode to reduce battery usage by up to 90 percent. Interestingly, the startup also says that it could be harder to hit your goal because of the increased accuracy. As a reminder, Human is a passive app designed to help you stay healthy with a simple goal. Every day, you need to move for 30 minutes or more, and keep up with this simple habit. The company calls this the ‘Daily 30′ and will gently nudge you when you hit your goal for example. In some ways, Apple is using the same approach with the fitness features of the Apple Watch. But Human works with your iPhone. Once your app is set up, you can forget about it and check it every now and then to see how you’re doing — no need to hit a button when you go for a run or a bike ride. But if you want more details, there is also a newly redesigned timeline with maps, stats and calories burnt to learn more about your day. The Apple Watch app was updated for watchOS 2. Finally, for those unfamiliar with Human, you can also create clubs for friends and family members to motivate yourself even more. It’s also a good platform to find some time and run with your friends for example. And Human’s most convincing argument is still true — the app looks beautiful. There are even new background photos for existing users.  Latest headlines delivered to you daily

VidMob Raises $2M To Build A Marketplace Where You Can Find Professional Video Editors
2015/10/15
So you’ve shot some cool video footage — congrats! But if it needs any editing, you’ve still got a lot of work ahead of you. Or you could try out a startup called VidMob, which is building a marketplace for professional video editors. The company has been beta testing its products, with plans to launch an iOS soon, and an Android app later on. VidMob is also announcing that it has raised $2 million in seed funding Foundation Capital and Acacia Woods Partners, plus various media executives and the venture arm of ad agency Mother New York. Founder and CEO Alex Collmer said that he decided to launch the service because of the growing amount of video content online (in his words, “the web was quickly become a video medium”), as well as the growing number of smartphones, GoPro cameras and other devices that are capable of shooting that footage. New tools have also emerged on the editing side, such as Animoto and Magisto, but Collmer argued that they “sort of fall flat.” “The algorithm simply doesn’t know if my kid scored a goal or he fell on his face,” he said. “It doesn’t know if the joke that I said landed or if anyone is laughing at me.” In Collmer’s view, automated editing tools can’t replace the knowledge of human editors — but at the same time, you may not know any editors yourself, or you might not have the money to pay the sometimes hefty editing fees.  With VidMob, you can directly upload clips from your phone, then different editors can bid to work on your project. Once the bids are in, you can look at editors’ past work and select the one who seems like the right fit (or is charging the right price). Collmer said the prices will vary depending on the length and complexity of the project — ultimately, they’re up to the editors themselves. But as an example, he said that if a restaurant owner wanted to create a promotional video from footage shot in their establishment, it might only take 10 seconds to upload the footage and cost only $30. At the same time, Collmer that he’s not just trying to “match up people with overseas editors who can edit your stuff together on the cheap.” Instead, VidMob could help people with editing talent and experience find new opportunities to make money, regardless of whether or not they’re employed as an editor. “One thing that we focus on is having this be a positive force for employment,” he said. “We think that this can create millions of jobs.” Collmer added that VidMob will also make its technology available through APIs, which could make it easier for other online marketplaces to add video content.

 And he’s not ruling out the idea of introducing other roles to the marketplace, like someone who can actually shoot your video. However, he said the advantage of focusing on editors is that “our business is not geographically constrained.” The current plan is to launch VidMob on iOS at the end of October. Collmer is hoping to have thousands of editors on-board by then.  Latest headlines delivered to you daily

Dropbox Announces Paper, A Google Docs Competitor
2015/10/15
Dropbox is going head-to-head against a very popular web app, Google Docs. Dropbox Paper is a collaborative document editing platform in your browser. It lets you edit a document in real time with your Dropbox contacts. Here’s how it works. Paper users can create a document and type text right away. Compared to Google Docs or Quip, it has very few rich-text editing features. If you want to format your document, you’ll have to use another word-processing app. In some ways, this is reminiscent of Etherpad. What if you want to add images and videos? You can browse your Dropbox and add a Dropbox link directly in the document. Paper will automatically change these links into images and videos. It also does the same with other web content, such as YouTube videos, SoundCloud songs and more. You can write todo lists, @mention people in the document to notify them when you need someone else’s feedback and also leave comments next to a specific paragraph. Our own Sarah Perez first reported the existence of Project Composer back in March. It’s the result of the acquisition of HackPad. Some ProductHunt users could even use an early version of the product. I called Paper a Google Docs competitor, even though it seems quite different with the smart embeds and mostly plain text approach. It looks like a white board more than a document creation platform. But then again, many Google Docs users already use the service to quickly draft something. So it’s unclear whether Google Docs users will switch to Paper to do something they can already do with Google Docs without the nice embeds. Paper isn’t available just yet. You have to sign up to a waiting list first. Latest headlines delivered to you daily

WedPics Team Releases Photo, A Collaborative Photo-Sharing App For iOS, Android And Web
2015/10/15
The makers of the popular social app for weddings, WedPics, is today launching a new app for social-photo sharing in an effort to retain customers after the big day has wrapped. The sister app, simply called “Photo,” is meant to serve as an extension or companion to the company’s flagship application, offering couples and their guests a way to continue to take and share photos related to future life events, big and small, including family gatherings, birthdays, baby showers, and more. The idea for a second app was actually the result of user feedback, reports WedPics co-founder and CEO Justin Miller, as the company’s number one question from customers was whether or not there was a WedPics-like app for other occasions. In addition, the startup has been facing the same challenge that any of those in the weddings space also have to confront – customer churn. A few months after the wedding is over, the photos have been shared and printed, users drop off of the app. To date, WedPics has seen over 4 million users on its platform, and currently has 1 million active customers, but it’s always on the hunt for more. “The flaw with WedPics is that we have a limited amount of time with our users,” says Miller. Meanwhile, the company was also seeing a small number of customers – around 2-3% of its user base – using the WedPics app for things other than weddings. “It seemed like a natural extension to WedPics to continue that relationship,” Miller explains. Though similar to WedPics in some ways, the new Photo app is its own entity. While it still offers a feed and features large image thumbnails in its user interface, the app’s focus is more on the individual user, as opposed to the wedding. Similar to other collaborative photo album apps on the market, Photo lets you create private, collaborative albums which you can invite others to join via email or text. However, where it’s slightly differentiated from some of its competitors is that it also lets users with digital cameras upload those photos through a web interface at PhotoApp.com. (And yes, in case you’re wondering, that URL is the reason why the WedPics team picked a fairly generic name for its new app. The URL alone was seeing 200,000 searches per month, before they snapped it up.) In addition, notes Miller, the company believes in its ability to compete with other collaborative photo album apps thanks to its experiences running WedPics. That is, instead of trying to hit the market and grab the attention of a new user base, the company is reaching out to WedPics customers, past and current, with the hopes of converting them to the new app now that the wedding is over.  This began yesterday with an email to the entire WedPics user base, and 24 hours later, Photo has gained over 2,500 users who are uploading, on average, 10 photos apiece. Prior to that, Photo had been in live beta tests for just a few weeks. The team also has extensive experience in marketing and retargeting, thanks to the time spent with WedPics, where they learned how to lower user acquisition costs while reaching the right demographics on social networks like Facebook and Pinterest. “We understand the proper way to bring something to market, not only from a [user interface/user experience] standpoint, but also from a marketing standpoint,” says Miller. Plus, he adds, the app isn’t just another generic photo app. “We’re bringing something to market that is an extension of WedPics. It’s the natural movement from the wedding to everything after the wedding – it moves into Photo,” he says. Despite the need to grab new customers all the time, WedPics is still doing well, pulling in around $60,000 to $70,000 per month in revenue, thanks to its photo-printing feature. Next year, it will also begin introducing retailers to the WedPics customers base, while charging for highly targeted views those retailers will receive. In time, the company could introduce similar revenue streams into Photo. The Raleigh-based startup, a team of 29, has raised $9.85 million to date and is nearing the close on a couple million more. The new Photo app is a free download on iOS and Android, as is available on the web. Latest headlines delivered to you daily

Married Founders Of Wildfire Leave Google 3 Years After $350M+ Buyout
2015/10/15
Wife and husband duo Victoria Ransom and Alain Chuard hit the jackpot on social. With every brand trying to figure out a Faceboook marketing strategy in 2008, the two built a startup called Wildfire that did it for them. Wildfire helped companies develop a presence, share content, run contests, and buy ads on social networks including Twitter and Pinterest. Google looking to barge into the social, bought Wildfire in 2012 for a whopping $350 million, plus a potential $100 million in performance earnouts. The purchase came after a flurry of massive social marketing acquisitions, when Google lost Buddy Media after Salesforce paid $689 million, and Oracle bought Virtrue and Involver for hundreds of millions.  But Ransom and Chuard always had a penchant for wanderlust, known for their love of snowboarding enormous, remote mountain ranges. By the end of 2014, Google had finished folding Wildfire into its Doubleclick ad platform, stopped taking clients, and planned to curtail services by the end of 2015. So after three years of vesting their Google stock, the couple just revealed they’re exiting the Googleplex…or…Alphabettery. In a post on Facebook, Chuard wrote “Goodbye Google. It’s been an incredible three years and we will be forever grateful for the opportunity you gave us and the Wildfire team. But it’s time for the next adventure. Stay tuned…” Over Twitter DM, Chuard gave me a little more color, saying “We’re going to take a break to spend time with family and do a bit of traveling while we explore some new ideas but at this point in time we don’t have any specific announcement.”  Ransom, Wildfire’s CEO, grew her company to 30,000 customers and 400 employees before selling to Google. There she became a Director Of Product and ran social strategy for the Display division, according to her LinkedIn. She integrated Wildfire into Google Analytics, DoubleClick, and Google+ while surpassing targets for bookings from clients. She’d previously founded an adventure travel company called Access Trips before getting an M.B.A. from Harvard. Chuard became the Head Of Product for Google My Business following the WIldfire integration. There he led efforts to get businesses and their details established on Google platforms like search, Maps and Google+. The Stanford Graduate School Of Business grad had previously founded a marketing startup called IncFuel. With Wildfire cooling down and social seeming like less of a priority for Google, the timing makes sense for Ransom and Chuard’s exit. Three and four-year vesting schedules are typical for stock granted from being acquired, so the two might have gotten their money and reached a cliff where there was less financial incentive to stick around. Ransom still lists herself as an entrepreneur, and Chuard’s mention of “the next adventure” is often Silicon Valley parlance for starting a new company. With investors eager to fund tried and true founders, the couple should have no trouble igniting another startup. Latest headlines delivered to you daily

Trello Integrates Shipping Data From USPS, UPS, FedEx And Others
2015/10/15
Project management service Trello today launched a new feature that brings shipping and tracking data from UPS, USPS, FedEx, OnTrac and LaserShip right into Trello cards. That’s a nifty little feature for existing Trello users, given that it now allows them to easily track their shipments in real time right from their project management tool. As the company told me, this means a small business could now use the service to easily track the progress of their shipments and as their status changes from in-transit to delivered, the card will automatically change colors from yellow to green (or to red when the shipment is delayed).  To get started, users simply have to click the new ‘Track Package’ button and enter their tracking number and select a carrier. Trello recently launched its revamped business offering, which includes a number of other third-party integrations, too. Like Atlassian, Trello is clearly looking to expand outside of the developer niche that first adopted the service. Developers don’t care all that much about tracking packages — small businesses do. And that’s a market that hasn’t really adopted these kind of project management tools yet.    Latest headlines delivered to you daily

17hats Raises $4M Series A To Help Solo Entrepreneurs Run Their Businesses
2015/10/15
It’s not easy being a solo entrepreneur. And if you’re a wedding photographer, wedding planner, interior designer, artisan pickle-maker, freelance web designer or developer, chances are you spend a significant amount of time simply managing the mundane tasks it takes to keep the business going. Think creating quotes for customers, keeping your books in order, and managing contracts and invoices. That’s not why you got into business in the first place, but it’s a necessary evil. 17hats is trying to make life easier for these entrepreneurs by giving them a single platform on which to manage all aspects of their business. The company today announced that it has raised a $4 million Series A round led by Wavemaker Partners, which also led the company’s $1.3 million seed round earlier this year.  As 17hats CEO and founder Donovan Janus told me, he came up with the idea for the platform after his wife’s photography business took off. The more successful the business became, the more managing it became a headache. “Over time, it was rubbing off the joy of starting a business,” he told me. “So I started looking around for what was there to help my wife.” But what he found was that the market either offered comprehensive tools for more advanced users or a collection of single-purpose services that didn’t play well together. So in 2011, he started 17hats and launched a basic MVP in 2012. The company then launched a far more comprehensive version last October, based on what the team learned from the MVP. Janus told me the team basically had to launch at that point because money was getting tight. Since then, 17hats has added 10,000 paying users and managed to get to $2 million in subscription revenue in its first year.  The company developed all of the different units in its app in-house, but it also integrates with tools like Google Calendar and services like Intuit. The service offers monthly subscriptions, but it mostly pushes its highly discounted annual and bi-annual subscriptions. Janus tells me the reason for this is that part of using its service means entrepreneurs have to change their habits — and they are far more likely to do so when they make a more significant monetary investment in the service. Donovan noted that the company aims to make the service as easy to use as possible, but to help new users during the onboarding process, it holds two webinars per week, as well as one-on-one training sessions for $49 (which comes with three months of free service, which is worth about $39 on the company’s monthly plan). Looking ahead, 17hats plans to expand its team, which now consists of about 20 employees on its payroll, and marketing efforts. For the most part, 17hats is going after solo entrepreneurs, though Donovan noted that there are also a number of small businesses on the platform already. Over time, 17hats may add some features for these (very) small businesses, but he wants to be mindful of adding new features that could take away from the simplicity of the current service; he left the door open for maybe adding support for a third-party payroll service, for example.

Hatch Baby, Maker Of Smart Products For New Parents, Raises $7M Series A From True Ventures
2015/10/15
Hatch Baby, whose Smart Changing Pad is due to ship soon, plans to conceive new tech-based services for parents after raising a $7 million Series A from True Ventures. Other participants in the round included Geoff Ralston, James Hong, H. Barton Co-Invest Fund, and Veddis Ventures. True Ventures also invested in Hatch Baby co-founder and chief executive officer Ann Crady Weiss’ previous startup, a social networking site for parents called Maya’s Mom that was acquired by BabyCenter in 2007. Hatch Baby’s first offering, the Smart Changing Pad, is currently taking pre-orders and scheduled to ship in December. The product is a diaper-changing pad with a wireless scale that helps parents track their offspring’s development. Its companion app, which can be used without the changing pad, lets parents see if their baby is hitting milestones set by the World Health Organization. For people who don’t have kids yet or new parents who are wondering why they should spend $199 (the Smart Changing Pad’s pre-order price) on a changing pad when regular ones start at about $15, Weiss says having a convenient way to weigh a baby and record data can be reassuring. “Often new parents have no idea whether their infant is getting enough nutrition or is growing as they should. That means frequent, panicked trips to the doctor or lactation consultant to weigh baby and make sure he or she is doing all right,” she told TechCrunch in an email. “The Smart Changing Pad lets parents know from day one, from the comfort of home, whether their baby is getting enough nutrition and growing at a healthy rate.” The Smart Changing Pad’s closest competitor is probably the Withings Smart Kid Scale, which retails for $179.95 and also sends data to an app. Having a changing pad that doubles as a scale might make it easier to weigh fidgety babies, however, and also means new parents have one less thing to buy. Weiss says Hatch Baby will use its new funding to develop the Smart Changing Pad and services for its community of users before eventually launching other products.

Bezar Ventures Beyond The Pop-Up Shop With The Launch Of Storefronts
2015/10/15
Bezar, the bizarre bazaar imagined by Fab.com cofounder Bradford Shellhammer, is today introducing a more traditional marketplace for design brands to sell their wares called Storefronts.  Bezar launched in March 2015 with a very clear system. Four designers from four separate categories (art, accessories, house, and jewelry) would be featured each day on the front page of Bezar, with prices ranging between $50 and $100 (and sometimes far exceeding that). Just like a real-life bazaar, the products only had a shelf life of 24 hours to three days.  “Launching a marketplace has been the plan all along,” said Shellhammer. “After systematically speaking with designers, it became clear that there is a wide range of designers who are too big to be considered hobbyists and too small to manufacture their products for thousands of stores. Plus, they are afraid of being ripped off by big chains.”  To solve this, the company has launched storefronts, where highly curated (by Shellhammer) design brands will have their own page on Bezar to feature their line.  With Storefronts, brands set their own pricing and Bezar takes a relatively high percentage of sales, in exchange for the digital retail space, customer service, along with shipping and part of the fulfillment process (all handled by Bezar).  This differs from Bezar’s pop-up shops (otherwise known as flash sales), where Bezar buys up inventory at wholesale and sells it at a markup.  This all seems pretty cut and dry, but Bezar’s business model gets truly interesting when it comes to art. Whether in a pop-up shop or in a storefront, Bezar licenses art and handles all printing, framing, shipping, fulfillment, etc. for this product category, paying out royalties to the artist for each sold piece.  Shellhammer says about 30 percent of revenue comes from the art category. “We’re very strict with gross margins,” said Shellhammer. “When you blend monthly sales together, from each product category, we’ve never fallen below 50 percent gross margins, sometimes getting north of 60 percent on good months.”  Since launch, Bezar has worked with about 750 design brands on pop-up shops, with 100 of them launching today with their own storefronts.  “I hand-picked and invited each of them,” said Shellhammer. “We decided based on a number of factors, including what sold the best, which products I love the most, and who was easiest to work with.”  The products launching today on Storefronts are mostly brand new lines, and Shellhammer explains that it gives the shopper with intent a reason to like Bezar.  “If you’re like me, and you love beautiful objects and you’ll buy something shiny if it’s danged before your eyes, Bezar pop-up shops are perfect for you,” said Shellhammer. “But we also want to capture the user who is shopping with intent, for something specific.” Shellhammer expects the number of storefronts to rapidly increase, but the design wunderkind says that he’s sticking to the pop-up shop model as the heart and soul of Bezar.

Kinnek, A Small Biz Marketplace, Raises $20 Million Led By Thrive Capital
2015/10/15
Kinnek, a New York-based marketplace for small businesses to find suppliers and manage purchasing, has just raised $20 million in Series B funding led by Thrive Capital. It already looks like a smart bet. The company currently has 20,000 businesses and 2,000 suppliers using its marketplace, and they’re striking millions of dollars worth of deals every week, says cofounder Karthik Sridharan. Considering the company’s age and the fragmented landscape in which it’s operating – think restaurants to distilleries to manufacturers – that kind of traction is meaningful. It’s also just the tip of the iceberg, apparently. According to a spokesperson for the company, Kinnek “conservatively” estimates that U.S. businesses with up to 100 employees and $20 million in yearly sales spend more than $2.2 trillion annually on machinery, equipment and physical goods based on data from Visa, Intuit, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. While we can’t vouch for the accuracy of that number (there are lots of different figures floating around out there), what is clear is the competition, or lack of it, facing Kinnek. A preliminary search by DataFox, a business intelligence company, turns up just four upstarts trying to connect small businesses with suppliers online in recent years — Kinnek, BuyersBestFriend, SupplyBid, and SupplyHog — and the last three are focused on specific verticals. (SupplyHog, for example, is a platform for the construction industry.) It’s easy to understand Kinnek’s value proposition. Most small companies are stuck buying machinery or other bulk supplies from the same outfits they’ve always worked with. Kinnek plugs them into a world where they can easily get customized quotes from numerous suppliers who, because they’re competing, presumably offer better pricing. Buyers don’t pay a dime to use the platform. Only suppliers are charged a broker fee, as well as a cut of each transaction. (It varies depending on the product being sold.) Kinnek doesn’t seem terribly concerned about disintermediation, either. The key, it says, are incentives like ratings and reviews that build up businesses for suppliers. “In the [business-to-business] world, there’s nothing like a Yelp to help you understand the reputation of a particular factory,” says Sridharan. Because suppliers can establish a name for themselves through Kinnek, it drives more business and keeps them from going around Kinnek for a deal or two. Indeed, going forward, Kinnek aims to create more of a social graph for its customers. The company already hosts Q&A forums where buyers can ask questions and suppliers can answer them for “reputation points.” The company next plans to address groups of business owners based on their common business-related interests, with an eye toward facilitating much more interaction between them. It also wants to handle more in terms of payments, the partial showing of catalogues, and invoicing. And Kinnek plans to beef up the types of businesses on the platform, with targets that include hotels, motels, farms and other agriculture-based companies. The 30-person startup will use some of its new capital to hire salespeople toward that end, but Sridharan says some are likely to find the company on their own. “There’s so much latent demand for a purchasing tool like this, it feels like it’s been decades in the making,” he says. Along with Thrive, Kinnek’s newest funding comes from earlier backers Matrix Partners, Sierra Ventures, Version One Ventures, and Angelpad, as well as individual investors, including AngelList cofounder Naval Ravikant. To date, it has raised $33 million. Latest headlines delivered to you daily

Deezer Is Losing Subscribers But Growing Revenue
2015/10/15
After filing for an IPO on Euronext, music-streaming service Deezer released its IPO documents in preparation for its public listing. The company plans to raise at least $343 million (€300 million). And yet, it is currently losing subscribers. The French company separates its user base into three categories: As of June 30, 2015, Deezer had 1.5 million standalone subscribers and 1.5 million active bundle subscribers. Overall, Deezer has 3 million active users. As for inactive bundle subscribers, 3.3 million people could be using Deezer without paying an additional subscription. If you look a bit further back in time, Deezer’s user base has peaked at the end of 2014, with 1.3 million standalone subscriptions, 1.6 million active bundle subscriptions and a whooping 4 million inactive bundle subscriptions. Overall, in December 2014, Deezer had 6.9 subscribers. In June 2015, there were 6.3 million.  And this is key to understanding how Deezer is different from Spotify or Apple Music. The majority of its user base got a subscription through a telecom company. In France, Orange heavily promoted the music streaming service a couple of years ago. But France isn’t the exception as the company has signed the same kind of deals in many countries. As of June 30, 2015, 40 telecom companies sold Deezer subscriptions around the world. Yet, deals vary from country to country. For example, it looks like Orange isn’t paying Deezer anything for inactive bundle subscribers in France, but that isn’t the case everywhere. That’s why the average revenue per user is higher for standalone subscriptions. In fact, standalone subscribers are finally generating more revenue than bundle subscribers in total.  While the company reported a $31 million (€27 million) loss for 2014, its revenue is growing like crazy. Deezer reported $106.4 million in revenue for the first six months of 2015, an impressive 40.9 percent jump compared to the same period in 2014. There are a few key takeaways from today’s numbers. Deezer’s future is in standalone subscribers. If the company fosters its standalone subscriber growth rate, it could drive Deezer’s bottom line. Bundle subscriptions were a great growth driver, but now that many people know what Deezer is in Europe and Latin America, it needs to attract standalone subscribers. Deezer is also leaving a ton of money on the table. These inactive bundle subscribers are worrying. They could be using Deezer because their Internet service provider or phone carrier is basically giving Deezer subscriptions for free. But they are choosing not to switch to Deezer. The company couldn’t convince these potential users. It shows that Deezer still has to work on its product to convince all these people that they should be using Deezer over Spotify, Apple Music, their iTunes libraries or even CDs.

Hermo, One Of Southeast Asia’s Top Beauty Sites, Lands $2M Series A
2015/10/14
Browsing for beauty products should be relaxing, but anyone who has visited a makeup counter knows that you often weather a deluge of upselling before finally escaping with a purchase. Hermo, a Malaysia-based e-commerce site, wants to make cosmetics shopping fun for customers in Southeast Asia. The site, which also operates in Singapore and is planning to expand into Indonesia soon, just announced a $2 million Series A from Gobi Partners. The capital will be used for product development and hiring as Hermo prepares for its Indonesia debut. Its last funding was a RM 450,000 (about $100,000) seed round raised in February 2012, when the company launched. Chief executive officer Ian Chua say he and his co-founders, chief operating officer Ian Mok, and vice president of merchandise P.S. Chong, wanted to start an online retail business in Southeast Asia because they believe “that the future of retail in the region will be driven by e-commerce.” They homed in on cosmetics and skincare after seeing “the amount of time our female friends and family spent picking out cosmetics products,” explains Chua. As the trio did more market research, they also discovered that beauty products enjoy strong margins that remain consistent even during market fluctuations and enjoy higher levels of customer loyalty than other types of products. Hermo’s business model combines flash sales with regular inventory and it specializes in premium brands. The startup maintains direct relationships with its suppliers, which means it can offer lower prices, more products, and avoid counterfeits, a problem on some marketplaces. Its founders have lofty goals for Hermo. “Eventually we see ourselves dominant in Southeast Asia,” says Chua. “We will have significant operations within three countries by the end of the year—Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. We are already the top cosmetics e-commerce site in Malaysia and we believe we can duplicate this success in other markets. The Internet, particularly mobile, is experiencing rapid growth. We already take nearly half of our orders from our mobile site. Southeast Asia is a mobile-first market and we are well-positioned to capture this trend.” The company now claims over 150,000 monthly active users and says it has been profitable for a year now. Its revenue reached RM 10 million (about $2.4 million) during the twelve months ending in September, representing a three times year-on-year growth. Surfing The Korean Wave Hermo competes with Luxola, which acquired by cosmetics retail giant Sephora last year and ships to nine countries, including Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and the Philippines. Both sell luxury products, but Luxola focuses on western brands, while Hermo’s specialty is Asian beauty companies. It has a supplier relationship with French brand L’Oreal, but Hermo’s bestsellers come from South Korea. The country’s cosmetics industry is currently enjoying a growing profile around the world (another example of an e-commerce startup riding the “Korean wave,” as the trend for Korean pop culture and products is known, is Seoul-based Memebox, which has raised $29 million in funding and is expanding into China and the U.S.). Hermo founders Ian Chua, Ian Mok, and P.S. Chong Another competitor is e-commerce Lazada, which has a cosmetics vertical and has grown rapidly throughout Southeast Asia thanks to generous backing from Rocket Internet. Chua believes Hermo’s focus on localization, however, will give it an edge. While Internet and smartphone penetration is growing quickly in Southeast Asia, it still varies widely from country to country. Chua notes that most cosmetics purchases in Southeast Asia are still made in brick-and-mortar stores, but believes more shoppers will start buying makeup online because they can find better prices, a wider selection of products, and user feedback (Hermo has a “beauty wall” with over 50,000 customer reviews). Regional logistic companies, including aCommerce and SingPost, are busy growing their delivery networks, which will help Hermo because it has to guarantee timely deliveries and fast returns (Chua says that the company has discussed in-house logistics to have more control over customer service quality, but has no concrete plans yet). Chua points out that Southeast Asia is a fragmented marketplace and Hermo will have to deal with different consumer demands in each market, new languages, and local regulatory issues. Instead of hindering growth, however, Chua believes this emphasizes how important it is for Southeast Asian startups to launch with an expansion strategy in mind. “That’s why I believe that somewhere out there in Southeast Asia, there is a global-level unicorn just waiting to be discovered. If you can expand and succeed in Southeast Asia, it makes your company better positioned to succeed globally through that experience. Latest headlines delivered to you daily

Let’s Talk About The Square IPO
2015/10/14

Jack Dorsey Owns 24.4% Of Square
2015/10/14
Square’s newly revealed IPO filing shows that co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey is the largest shareholder, owning 24.4 percent of the company. Square last raised capital at a $6 billion valuation, implying that Dorsey’s stake is worth at least $1.46 billion. We will get a better sense of what Square’s value as a public company is when its expected share price range is revealed in the coming weeks. Co-founder and director Jim McKelvey has a much smaller stake than Dorsey, owning just 9.4 percent of the company, last valued at $564 million. While notably less than Dorsey, it is still a greater percentage than Box CEO Aaron Levie, whose 5.7 percent stake was considered low for an active founder. Square also has a long list of Silicon Valley investors, having raised about $600 million in funding. Khosla Ventures has by far the biggest stake for a venture capital firm, owning 17.3 percent, or roughly $1 billion. Vinod Khosla is on Square’s board of directors. JPMC Strategic Investments, or JP Morgan, has significant ownership, at 5.5 percent. Sequoia Capital and Rizvi Traverse, each have 5.4 percent equity. BuzzFeed also noticed a provision, called a ratchet, in the S-1 that could give some investors even more. Some of its biggest backers have been promised a 20 percent gain when the IPO prices. If it’s below $18.56, they will get issued shares to make up for the discrepancy. Latest headlines delivered to you daily

Square’s IPO Filing Lists Jack Dorsey’s CEO Role At Twitter As A Risk Factor
2015/10/14
Square filed for its initial public offering today, and buried in the company’s boilerplate risk factors was a big one: CEO Jack Dorsey’s relationship with Twitter. Here’s the relevant section on being able to depend on key management: “Our future success is significantly dependent upon the continued service of our executives and other key employees. If we lose the services of any member of management or any key personnel, we may not be able to locate a suitable or qualified replacement, and we may incur additional expenses to recruit and train a replacement, which could severely disrupt our business and growth. Jack Dorsey, our co-founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer, also serves as Chief Executive Officer of Twitter. This may at times adversely affect his ability to devote time, attention, and effort to Square.

This has been a huge point of contention for both companies. Throughout the CEO search process for Twitter, Dorsey was considered a leading candidate, but his relationship with Square was seen as a point that could impede his ability to lead the company. Of course, Dorsey also co-founded Twitter. In the end, Twitter went with Dorsey, who will still be running both companies. It remains to be seen whether this will impede his ability to run Square, but the company is certainly acknowledging the possibility in its IPO filing. Latest headlines delivered to you daily

An API For Your Door
2015/10/14
August Smart Locks wants to usher in a new level of convenience for the on-demand economy. Instead of rushing home to meet your courier, cleaner, or assistant, or having to give strangers a copy of your house key, you can just authorize them to open your door via August. By launching its August Access partnership program with companies like Postmates, Shyp, Handy, and Alfred, August gets a big cross-promotion opportunity while helping these services work more smoothly. It’s basically an API for your door. You connect the services like Pro.com, Envoy, Fetch, or Sears Home Services, and then when your service provider arrives, their smartphone will temporarily open your door, or they’ll get a limited-use code to punch into the keypad. For example, Alfred’s home managers can use August to come make your bed or coordinate recieval of your grocery or laundry deliveries while you’re gone — but you don’t have to give them a physical key they could use anytime. The system makes even more sense for one-off services where you’ll have a different helper each time, like Postmates. Your dinner take-out can be waiting on your kitchen counter when you get home. The alliances create a smart cross-promotion opportunity where both August and the partners drive business to each other. Some even offer deals, like August owners getting a free month of Alfred, and Alfred users getting 50% off an August lock in 2015 or 20% off through 2016. August can use any help it can get selling its three new products, including a Siri-integrated lock, a keypad, and one with a camera so you can see who’s at the door remotely.  While most partnerships in tech are just websites or back-end systems cooperating, the August Access platform literally unlocks new behaviors and business models for the physical world. Imagine while at your office being able to have Postmates bring you something your forgot at home. Or having flowers waiting on the table for your significant other when you’re away. Got stuck at the office and suddenly need WagWalking to take your dog out? You don’t need to have prearranged a key exchange.  Home rentals could see a serious boon from temporary keyless entry. August is working with Pillow, which will clean the sheets and do the key hand-offs for your Airbnb or VRBO rental. Now the Pillowers will be able to get in to spruce up without a key. But the big missing partnership here is clearly Airbnb itself. If your guests could just let themselves in, but you didn’t have to worry picking up and dropping off keys, or them secretly making copies, you might be a lot more willing to rent out your home. If I leave for two weeks, but one week into my trip I want to rent out my place, that would have been tough to arrange before. One day if Airbnb and August get everything lined up, letting my guests in could be as easy as one tap from the other side of the world.  Of course, there will always be safety concerns with letting strangers into your house, even temporarily. Services providing August integrations should spell out insurance coverage for if something goes wrong while one of their agents is inside your home. At least the fact that there’s a paper-trail means it’d be hard to get away with a crime while working for one of August’s partners. And you might think it all sounds a bit creepy, but so did GPS, social networks, and Uber at first. We get comfortable quick as long as safety is maintained. Smart locks seem like one of those inevitable technologies. But in the meantime, plenty of people will be reluctant to endure the upgrade cost and work to get one. The only way they’ll be nudged along is by seeing truly unique use cases their old-school slice of jagged metal can’t offer. Not having to carry or dig out your own keys is nice, but it’s not fundamentally different from how locks already worked. August Access shows just how much can change if you’re ready to step into the future. Latest headlines delivered to you daily
