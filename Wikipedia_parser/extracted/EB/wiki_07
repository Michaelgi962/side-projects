Climate of Australia

The climate of Australia varies widely due to its large geographical size, but by far the largest part of Australia is desert or semi-arid. Only the south-east and south-west corners have a temperate climate and moderately fertile soil. The northern part of the country has a tropical climate, varied between tropical rainforests, grasslands, part desert.
Australia's climate is ruled by the hot, sinking air of the subtropical high pressure belt which moves north and south with the seasons. This causes the rainfall pattern over Australia to be highly seasonal. Australia's rainfall is the lowest of the seven continents (besides Antarctica). Rainfall is variable, with frequent droughts lasting several seasons, thought to be caused in part by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.
Since it is a small continent separated from polar regions by the Southern Ocean, Australia does not get the harsh snaps of polar air that swarm over Northern Hemisphere continents during winter, which is why winter is relatively mild in the country with very little snow. The continents in the Northern Hemisphere have a considerable temperature contrast between summer and winter, whereas in Australia the temperature contrast is small. In many parts of the country, seasonal highs and lows can be great with temperatures ranging from above to well below zero. Minimum temperatures are moderated by the lack of mountains and the influence of surrounding oceans.
The El Niño-Southern Oscillation is associated with seasonal abnormality in many areas in the world, although Australia is one of the most affected continents, which experiences extensive droughts alongside considerable wet periods. Occasionally a dust storm will blanket a region and there are reports of the occasional tornado. Tropical cyclones, heat waves, bushfires and frosts in the country are also associated with the Southern Oscillation. Rising levels of salinity and desertification in some areas is ravaging the landscape.
Temperatures in Australia have followed an increasing trend of global warming between the years of 1910 to 2004 by approximately 0.7 °C. Overnight minimum temperatures have warmed more rapidly than daytime maximum temperatures in recent years. The late-20th century warming has been largely attributed to the increased greenhouse effect. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, 80% of the land have a rainfall less than per year and 50% having even less than . As a whole, Australia has a very low annual average rainfall of .
Precipitation.
Rain.
The rainfall patterns across Australia are highly seasonal. It however rains more in winter than in summer by approximately 11%, and compared to the Earth's other continental landmasses Australia is very dry. More than 80% of the continent has an annual rainfall of less than ; only Antarctica receives less rainfall than Australia. A place inland near Lake Eyre (in South Australia) would only receive of rain annually. Another place, Troudaninna Bore "(coordinates : 29° 11' 44" S, 138° 59' 28" E, altitude : 46 m)" in South Australia, from 1893 to 1936, received, in average, 104.9 mm (4.13 inches) of precipitation. From one extreme to another, parts of the far North Queensland coast annually average over , with the Australian annual record being , set at the summit of Mount Bellenden Ker in 2000. There are four main factors that contribute to the dryness of the Australian landmass:
The average annual rainfall in the Australian desert is low, ranging from per year. Thunderstorms are relatively common in the region, with an average of 15 - 20 thunderstorms per annum. Summer daytime temperatures range from . In winter, this falls to .
The southern parts of Australia get the usual westerly winds and cold fronts that come with rain when the high pressure systems move towards northern Australian during winter. Cold snaps may bring frosts inland, though temperatures near the coast are almost mild all year round. Summers in southern Australia are generally dry and hot with coastal sea breezes. During a lengthy dry spell, hot and dry winds from the interior can cause bushfires in some of southern and eastern states, though most commonly Victoria and New South Wales.
The tropical areas of northern Australia have a wet summer because of monsoon presence. During "the wet", typically October to April, humid north-westerly winds bring showers and thunderstorms. In occasional cases, tropical cyclones can bring heavy rainfall to tropical coastal regions, which are also likely to reach further inland. After the monsoonal season, the dry season comes ("winter"), which mostly brings clear skies and mild conditions.
Low rate of evaporation from this very cool body of water result in little evaporation occurring. As a result, rain clouds are sparsely formed and very rarely do they form long enough for a continuous period of rain to be recorded. Australia's arid/semi-arid zone extends to this region. The absence of any significant mountain range or area of substantial height above sea level, results in very little rainfall caused by orographic uplift. In the east the Great Dividing Range limits rain moving into inland Australia.
Australia has a compact shape and no significant bodies of water penetrate very far inland. This is important because it means that moist winds are prevented from penetrating to inland Australia, keeping rainfall low.
Snow.
In Australia, snow falls frequently on the highlands near the east coast, in the states of Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania and in the Australian Capital Territory. There is a regular snow season in several areas which have seasonal ski tourism industries. Snow also falls with some regularity as far north as Stanthorpe, Queensland and in isolated parts of South Australia and Western Australia, but outside of these areas, snow is an extremely rare occurrence.
Snow at sea level is occasionally recorded on mainland Australia, but is more frequent in Tasmania where snowfalls at sea level can occur during the winter months. Snow has been recorded across most of Tasmania, though it is rare on the northern coast at sea level. Snow is rare in the southernmost capitals like Melbourne and Hobart, falling less than once every five years, and in the other capitals it is unknown (however snow has fallen in the hill suburbs of Perth and Adelaide). However, there are extensive, well-developed ski fields in the Great Dividing Range, a few hours' drive from Melbourne and Sydney. Light snow generally falls every winter in Canberra however, and other cities that may receive regular seasonal snowfalls include Orange, Lithgow and Katoomba in New South Wales.
The occasional cold snap, caused by cold air drifting north from Antarctica, can cause significant snowfall in rural areas, as well as major cities such as Hobart, Melbourne's outer mountain suburbs and Canberra. Such occasions are rare, but have occurred in 1951, 1986 and 2005, when snow fell as far north as Mackay in Queensland.
States and Territories.
Australian Capital Territory.
Because of its elevation () and distance from the coast, the Australian Capital Territory experiences a continental climate, unlike many other Australian cities whose climates are moderated by the sea. Canberra is notorious for hot, dry summers, and cold winters with occasional fog and frequent frosts. Many of the higher mountains in the territory’s south-west are snow-covered for at least part of the winter. Thunderstorms can occur between October and March, and annual rainfall is , with rainfall highest in spring and summer and lowest in winter
The highest maximum temperature recorded in the ACT was at Acton on 11 January 1939. The lowest minimum temperature was at Gudgenby on 11 July 1971.
New South Wales.
Over half of New South Wales has an arid or semi-arid climate. However, the eastern portion has a temperate climate, ranging from humid subtropical to the Central Coast and most of Sydney, and oceanic to the south coast. The Snowy Mountains region in the south-east falls in the alpine climate/highland climate zone, with cool to cold weather all year around and snowfalls in the winter. Further inland, the climate gets semi-arid and a desert climate towards the western part of the state.
The weather in the south of the state is generally hot in summer and cool in the winter as the seasons are well-defined in the south. The hottest New South Wales Climate region is the north-west part of the state, seasons are not well-defined in the north, where summers are hot and can be wet and winters are cooler and drier. The coldest region is the Snowy Mountains where the snow and frost continues for quite long durations during the winter months.
The highest maximum temperature recorded was at Menindee in the state's west on 10 January 1939. The lowest minimum temperature was at Charlotte Pass on 29 June 1994 in the Snowy Mountains. This is also the lowest temperature recorded in the whole of Australia excluding Australian Antarctic Territory.
Rainfall varies throughout the state. The far north-west receives the least, less than annually, while the east receives between of rain.
Northern Territory.
The Northern Territory has two distinctive climate zones. The northern end, including Darwin, has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen "Aw") with high humidity and two seasons, the wet (November to April) and dry season (May to October). During the dry season nearly every day is warm and sunny, and afternoon humidity averages around 30%. There is very little rainfall between May and September. In the coolest months of June and July, the daily minimum temperature may dip as low as , but very rarely lower, and frost has never been recorded.
The wet season is associated with tropical cyclones and monsoon rains. The majority of rainfall occurs between December and March (the Southern Hemisphere summer), when thunderstorms are common and afternoon relative humidity averages over 70% during the wettest months. On average more than of rain falls in the north. Thunderstorms can produce spectacular lightning displays.
The central region is the desert centre of the country, which includes Alice Springs and Uluru, and is semi-arid with little rain usually falling during the hottest months from October to March. Central Australia receives less than of rain per year.
The highest maximum temperature recorded in the territory was at Finke on 1 and 2 January 1960. The lowest minimum temperature was at Alice Springs on 12 July 1976.
Queensland.
Because of its size, there is significant variation in climate across the state. Low rainfall and hot summers are typical for the inland west, a monsoonal 'wet' season in the far north, and warm temperate conditions along the coastal strip. Inland and in southern ranges low minimum temperatures are experienced. The climate of the coastal strip is influenced by warm ocean waters, keeping the region free from extremes of temperature and providing moisture for rainfall.
There are five predominate climatic zones in Queensland, based on temperature and humidity:
However, most of the Queensland populace experience two weather seasons: a "winter" period of rather warm temperatures and minimal rainfall and a sultry summer period of hot, sticky temperatures and higher levels of rainfall.
The highest maximum temperature observed in the state is at Birdsville on 24 December 1972. The temperature of at Cloncurry on 16 January 1889 is not considered official; the figure quoted from Birdsville is the next highest, so that record is considered as being official.
The lowest minimum temperature is at Stanthorpe on 23 June 1961 and at The Hermitage on 12 July 1965.
South Australia.
The majority of the state has the arid and semi-arid climates. The southern coastal parts of the state have a Mediterranean climate with mild wet winters and hot dry summers. The highest rainfall occurs along the southern coasts and the Mount Lofty Ranges (with an average annual rainfall of in the vicinity of Mount Lofty); the lowest rainfall occurs in the Lake Eyre basin where the average annual totals are less than and possibly even . Most of the rain in the southern districts of the State fall during the winter months when the sub-tropical high-pressure belt is displaced to the north over the Australian continent.
South Australia's mean temperature range is in January and in July. Daily temperatures in parts of the state in January and February can be up to . The highest maximum temperature was recorded as at Oodnadatta on 2 January 1960, which is the highest official temperature recorded in Australia. The lowest minimum temperature was at Yongala on 20 July 1976.
Tasmania.
Tasmania has a cool temperate climate with four distinct seasons. Summer lasts from December to February when the average maximum sea temperature is and inland areas around Launceston reach . Other inland areas are much cooler with Liawenee, located on the Central Plateau, one of the coldest places in Australia with temperatures in February ranging between . Autumn lasts between March and May and experiences changeable weather, where summer weather patterns gradually take on the shape of winter patterns.
The winter months are between June and July and are generally the wettest and coolest months in the state, with most high lying areas receiving considerable snowfall. Winter maximums are on average along coastal areas and on the Central Plateau, thanks to a series of cold fronts from the Southern Ocean.
Spring is a season of transition, where winter weather patterns begin to take the shape of summer patterns, with snowfall still common up until October. Spring is generally the windiest time of the year with afternoon sea breezes starting to take effect on the coast.
Rainfall in Tasmania follows a complicated pattern rather analogous to that found on large continents at the same latitude in the Northern Hemisphere. On the western side rainfall increases from around at Strahan on the coast up to at Cradle Valley in the highlands.
There is a strong winter maximum in rainfall: January and February typically averages between 30-40% the rainfall of July and August, though even in the driest months rain usually falls on every second day and the number of rainy days per year is much greater than on any part of the Australian mainland. Further east in the Lake Country, annual rainfall declines to around , whilst in the Midlands, annual rainfall is as low as at Ross and generally below . The eastern part of Tasmania has more evenly distributed rainfall than in the west, and most months receive very similar averages.
The densely populated northern coast is much drier than the western side, with annual rainfall ranging from in Launceston to in Burnie in the north west and in Scottsdale located further to the east.
Most rain falls in winter, and in summer the average can be as low as per month in Launceston. The east coast is wetter than the Midlands, with an average annual rainfall ranging from in St. Helens to around in Swansea.
Here the rainfall is evenly distributed over the year but can be very erratic as heavy rainfalls from the warm Tasman Sea are quite frequent. Whereas a three-day fall of occurs only once every fifty years on the north coast, it occurs on average once every four or five years around Swansea and Bicheno, and on 7–8 June 1954, there were many falls as large as in two days in that area. The east coast is sometimes called the "sun coast" because of its sunny climate.
Several sections of inland Tasmania, together with Flinders Island, were declared drought-affected areas by the state government in 2007.
The highest recorded maximum temperature in Tasmania was at Scamander on 30 January 2009, during the 2009 south-eastern Australia heat wave. Tasmania's lowest recorded minimum temperature was on 30 June 1983, at Butlers Gorge, Shannon, and Tarraleah.
Victoria.
Victoria has a varied climate despite its small size. It ranges from semi-arid and hot in the north-west, to temperate and cool along the coast. Victoria's main land feature, the Great Dividing Range, produces a cooler, mountain climate in the centre of the state.
Victoria's southernmost position on the Australian mainland means it is cooler and wetter than other mainland states and territories. The coastal plain south of the Great Dividing Range has Victoria's mildest climate. Air from the Southern Ocean helps reduce the heat of summer and the cold of winter. Melbourne and other large cities are located in this temperate region.
The Mallee and upper Wimmera are Victoria's warmest regions with hot winds blowing from nearby deserts. Average temperatures top during summer and in winter. Victoria's highest maximum temperature of was recorded in Hopetoun on 7 February 2009, during the 2009 south-eastern Australia heat wave. A screen temperature of was recorded on 7 January 1906 in Mildura.
The Victorian Alps in the north-east are the coldest part of Victoria. The Alps are part of the Great Dividing Range mountain system extending east-west through the centre of Victoria. Average temperatures are less than in winter and below in the highest parts of the ranges. The state's lowest minimum temperature of was recorded at Omeo on 13 June 1965, and again at Falls Creek on 3 July 1970.
Rainfall.
Victoria is the wettest Australian state after Tasmania. Rainfall in Victoria increases from north to south, with higher averages in areas of high altitude. Median annual rainfall exceeds in some parts of the north-east but is less than in the Mallee.
Rain is heaviest in the Otway Ranges and Gippsland in southern Victoria and in the mountainous north-east. Snow generally falls only in the mountains and hills in the centre of the state. Rain falls most frequently in winter, but summer precipitation is heavier. Rainfall is most reliable in Gippsland and the Western District, making them both leading farming areas. Victoria's highest recorded daily rainfall was at Tanybryn in the Otway Ranges on 22 March 1983.
Western Australia.
The south-west corner of the state has a Mediterranean climate. The area was originally heavily forested, including large stands of the karri, one of the tallest trees in the world. This agricultural region of Western Australia is in the top nine terrestrial habitats for terrestrial biodiversity, with a higher proportion of endemic species than most other equivalent regions. Thanks to the offshore Leeuwin Current the area numbers in the top six regions for marine biodiversity, containing the most southerly coral reefs in the world.
Average annual rainfall varies from at the edge of the Wheatbelt region to in the wettest areas near Northcliffe, but in the months of November to March evaporation exceeds rainfall, and it is generally very dry. Plants must be adapted to this as well as the extreme poverty of all soils. A major reduction in rainfall has been observed, with a greater number of rainfall events in the summer months.
The central four-fifths of the state is semi-arid or desert and is lightly inhabited with the only significant activity being mining. Annual rainfall averages about , most of which occurs in sporadic torrential falls related to cyclone events in summer months.
An exception to this is the northern tropical regions. The Kimberley has an extremely hot monsoonal climate with average annual rainfall ranging from , but there is a very long almost rainless season from April to November. Eighty-five percent of the state's runoff occurs in the Kimberley, but because it occurs in violent floods and because of the insurmountable poverty of the generally shallow soils, the only development has taken place along the Ord River.
Australia's tropical/subtropical location and cold waters off the western coast make most of Western Australia a hot desert with aridity a marked feature of a greater part of the continent. These cold waters produce precious little moisture needed on the mainland. A 2005 study by Australian and American researchers investigated the desertification of the interior, and suggested that one explanation was related to human settlers who arrived about 50,000 years ago. Regular burning by these settlers could have prevented monsoons from reaching interior Australia.
Occurrence of snow in the state is rare, and typically only in the Stirling Range near Albany, as it is the only mountain range far enough south and with sufficient elevation. More rarely, snow can fall on the nearby Porongurup Range. Snow outside these areas is a major event; it usually occurs in hilly areas of south-western Australia. The most widespread low-level snow occurred on 26 June 1956 when snow was reported in the Perth Hills, as far north as Wongan Hills and as far east as Salmon Gums. However, even in the Stirling Range, snowfalls rarely exceed and rarely settle for more than one day.
The highest observed maximum temperature of was recorded at Mardie Station on 19 February 1998. The lowest minimum temperature recorded was at Eyre Bird Observatory on 17 August 2008.
Natural hazards and disasters.
Bushfires.
Climatic factors contribute to Australia's high incidence of bushfires, particularly during the summer months. Low relative humidity, wind and lack of rain can cause a small fire, either man-made or caused naturally by lightning strikes, to spread rapidly over large distances. Low humidity, the heat of the sun and lack of water cause vegetation to dry out becoming a perfect fuel for the fire. High winds fan the flames, increasing their intensity and the speed and distance at which they can travel.
Many of the worst bushfires in eastern Australia, such as the 1983 Ash Wednesday fires, accompany El Niño-Southern Oscillation events which tend to cause a warm, dry and windy climate. The worst bushfires in Australian history occurred on Black Saturday in February 2009. The human death toll of the disaster was 173, and over 2000 homes were lost.
Flooding.
Though Australia is generally dry and arid, a large portion of the country is in the tropics. Rainfall in these areas is extremely heavy. With some are areas recording world record breaking rain, such as the mountains which lie to the south west of Cairns. Through La Niña years the eastern seaboard of Australia records above average rainfall usually creating damaging floods.
The 2010–2011 La Nina system has broken many rainfall records in Australia, particularly in the states of Queensland and New South Wales, which have seen extensive flooding which has caused major damage to infrastructure and crops. The central east area of Queensland, an area the size of Germany and France combined, was under water in 2010–2011. The estimated damage bill could reach into the billions.
Some cities that see heavy yearly rainfall include: Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton, Byron Bay, Strahan
Global warming.
According to the majority of scientists, climate change is predicted by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) to have significant effects on the climate of and extreme weather events in Australia. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, Australia’s annual mean temperature for 2009 was above the 1961-90 average, making it the nation’s second warmest year since high-quality records began in 1910.
It is predicted that the Great Barrier Reef and reefs surrounding Lord Howe Island could be killed as a result of the rise in water temperature forecast by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report. The Murray River, Darling River Coorong and Macquarie Marshes are all at risk from decreased rainfall from climate change.
Coastal communities face risks from sea level rise, albeit over a long period of time based on current estimates of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. The Gold Coast, being built on sand and with many canal developments, could be considered particularly at risk. Suburbs of Sydney like Drummoyne and Concord on rivers like the Parramatta River face risks of inundation of low lying areas such as parks (such as Timbrell Park and Majors Bay Reserve) reclaimed from mudflats at the heads of bays, or massive expenses in rebuilding seawalls to higher levels.
Currently, there are several environmental movements and campaigners advocating for action on climate change. One such campaign is "The Big Switch", Australia's largest community climate change campaign.
New projections for Australia's changing climate includes:
Drought.
Drought in Australia is defined by rainfall over a three-month period being in the lowest ten percent of amounts having been recorded for that region in the past. This definition takes into account that low rainfall is a relative term and rainfall deficiencies need to be compared to typical rainfall patterns including seasonal variations. Specifically drought in Australia is defined in relation to a rainfall deficiency of pastoral leases and is determined by decile analysis applied to a certain area.
Historical climatic records are now sufficiently reliable to profile climate variability taking into account expectations for regions. State Governments are responsible for declaring a region drought affected and the declaration will take into account factors other than rainfall.
Cyclones.
Australia is affected by tropical cyclones which primarily occur between December and April but have developed in November and May, as well. Cyclones over mainland Australia occur on average five to six times each year. The region between Broome and Exmouth are most prone to cyclones. Tropical cyclones are known to bring destructive winds, heavy rain with flooding creating storm surges along the coast, causing inundation in low lying areas. The strongest Australian region cyclone was Cyclone Monica in 2006 which had wind gusts in excess of . Cyclones can also move inland, decaying to a rain depression, which dump heavy rain in these areas and causing flooding.
The worst cyclones of Australia have caused billions of dollars of damage and many deaths. Cyclone Tracy crossed directly over Darwin in 1974, 71 people were killed. Adjusted for inflation it was Australia's most damaging cyclone. Cyclone Mahina in 1899 brought a storm surge to Far North Queensland reaching high, causing 400 deaths and making it the worst natural disaster to befall Australia. Cyclone Larry struck North Queensland and passed over Innisfail in 2006 causing damages estimated at A$1.5 billion but no lives were lost. Cyclone Yasi caused severe flooding and had a total estimated cost of A$3.5 billion making it the second most costliest cyclone to strike Australia.
Blizzards.
Blizzards are not common in mainland Australia, but occur frequently in the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales and Victoria. When blizzards do occur, they can affect the Tasmanian Highlands and, particularly, Mount Wellington, which towers over the Tasmanian capital Hobart. Blizzards do not affect any major towns or cities, because there are no populated areas located in the mountains except for the ski resort towns of New South Wales and Victoria.
Dust storms.
A dust storm or sandstorm, a meteorological phenomenon common in arid and semi-arid regions, arises when a gust front passes or when the wind force exceeds the threshold value where loose sand and dust are removed from the dry surface. Particles are transported by saltation and suspension, causing soil erosion from one place and deposition in another.
The term "sandstorm" is used most often in the context of desert sandstorms, especially in the Sahara, when, in addition to fine particles obscuring visibility, a considerable amount of larger sand particles moves closer to the surface. The term "dust storm" is more likely to be used when finer particles are blown long distances, especially when the dust storm affects urban areas.
Extremes.
Temperatures.
The hottest temperature recorded in Australia was at Oodnadatta in South Australia, while the coldest was at Charlotte Pass, New South Wales. This is an absolute temperature variation of 73.7 °C. A temperature below has been recorded twice in Australia, while temperatures above have been recorded three times. Australia's record high winter temperature is recorded in Kalumburu, Western Australia, which is one of the hottest temperatures recorded for any country during their 'winter' season. The coldest summer temperature on record in Australia was , recorded in December at Thredbo Ski Resort.
The lowest maximum temperature on record in Australia was , recorded on the 9 July 1978 at Thredbo Ski Resort in New South Wales. The highest minimum temperature on record was , recorded on the 24 January 1982 in Arkaroola, South Australia and again on the 21 January 2003 in Wittenoom, Western Australia.
A list of extremes can be found in the tables below:
Rainfall.
Rainfall records tend to be concentrated along the east coast of Australia, particularly in tropical north Queensland. The highest 24 hour rainfall on record in Australia was in Crohamhurst on the 3 February 1893. The highest monthly rainfall on record was recorded at Mount Bellenden Ker, Queensland in January 1979. The highest annual rainfall was recorded also at Mount Bellenden Ker in the year 2000. Additionally, the location which receives the highest average annual rainfall in Australia is Babinda in Queensland with an annual average of .

Monroe Correctional Complex

The Washington State Reformatory Unit (WSRU) opened in 1910. It is now part of what is referred to as the five-unit Monroe Correctional Complex (MCC). WSRU houses inmates with a "closed" custody designation or lower. In other words, though it is a closed-custody facility, some inmates qualify as medium-custody, or even long-term minimum custody. Inmates are housed in two large cellblocks, the A-B wing and C-D wing. Approximately 875 inmates are housed there at any given time.
Facility.
A Segregation unit (Cell Block 3) provides about 80 beds for inmates who need to be temporarily removed from the general population.
WSRU has an inpatient hospital that can also be used by other correctional facilities within the state. Major medical care can often be performed here, but serious surgical procedures are performed in community hospitals.
Vocational classes offered at WSRU include printing, information technology and personal computer support specialist, and inmates can earn a GED or community college associates degree while incarcerated at WSRU.
A staff-supervised Youth Program is offered to high school and middle school students. It is designed to deter students from becoming involved in a criminal lifestyle by meeting selected inmates who tell them about the choices they made which led to their incarceration.
Class II and III jobs are located within WSRU. Class III jobs provide essential services to the facility such as maintenance, janitorial, clerical warehouse workers, and kitchen work. Class II jobs are designed to reduce the cost of goods and services to state agencies and other tax-supported entities. These include laundry services, a print shop, a license tab shop, and the panel program. Class I industries were once housed at WSRU, but were eliminated in July 2004 as a result of a Washington Supreme Court decision that held that inmates can not be employed by private commercial enterprises.
Inmates have access to classification and mental health counselors at WSRU, in addition to a wide range of paid and volunteer staff.
Additionally, the other four facilities are Minimum Security Unit (MSU), Twin Rivers Unit (TRU), Special Offenders Unit (SOU), and Intensive Management Unit IMU. To clarify: Monroe Correctional Complex; (MCC) comprises these five Prisons. Each within its own perimeter. And seldom will they mix. Normally Offenders from one prison are not allowed to enter inside the perimeter of any other facility.

Stephanie Kaye

Stephanie Kaye Kobalewsky is a fictional character on the "Degrassi Junior High" television series. She was portrayed by Nicole Stoffman.
Background.
Stephanie Kaye was born as Stephanie Kobalewsky in 1973. On her parents' divorce, she took her mother's maiden name Kaye. Popular, beautiful, but naive, Stephanie was the school president of Degrassi Junior High. She reinvented her image to become more "mature". Eventually, this image catches up to her as she tries to grow up too fast and stumbles upon problems because of this along the way. She would routinely leave her home for school dressed in relatively conservative apparel then change into something provocative after arriving at school.
Stephanie Kaye Kobalewsky was featured prominently in the first 2 seasons of "Degrassi Junior High", but was said to have gone to a private school in the remaining 3 seasons. In reality, actress Stoffman decided to pursue her acting career elsewhere. Although she had bit parts in Canadian TV movies, she eventually went to University and became a jazz musician.
Stephanie Kaye Kobalewsky was one of the most notorious characters in the "Degrassi" franchise, as well as one of the most controversial. Her sexualized image and apparent disregard for self-respect was a heavy storyline that permeated most of the first 2 seasons of the popular show. An example of this being her suggestive campaign slogan for class president, "All the Way with Stephanie Kaye!" 
Reception.
Nicole Stoffman was nominated for the Best Performance by a Lead Actress in a Continuing Dramatic Role at the 1987 Gemini Awards for her role as Stephanie Kaye Kobalewsky.

PureNRG

PureNRG (stylized as "pureNRG" and pronounced "Pure Energy") was a Christian pop group from Nashville, Tennessee. They were signed to Fervent Records in late 2006. They released six albums: their self-titled debut "pureNRG" (released May 2007), their second album "Here We Go Again" (released April 2008), a Christmas album "A pureNRG Christmas" (released September 2008), a remix album "reNRGized" (released December 2008), and their junior album "The Real Thing" (released July 2009). Their final album "" was released July 20, 2010.
History.
The band was formed of three members: Caroline Grace Elizabeth Williams, Laura Carolyne Joyce Myers and Jordan Ryan Yates. They were similar to the likes of Devo 2.0, Jump5, T-Squad and other Radio Disney stars, but had a very obvious Christian message on their recordings, and in their live performances. Their road manager was Brandon Hargest, formerly of the teen pop group Jump5. Caroline and Laura (who goes by Carolyne) met when they were three and attended the same dance class. Jordan became a friend later through him being in their older siblings' dance classes. The band was formed after they went to auditions being held by their management company. After winning, they signed with Fervent Records and started writing songs. They were featured opening acts on the Winter Jam 2008 and 2009 tours and with Jump5 for Jump5's farewell tour in which they performed songs from their first album. Although they have disbanded, they still plan to individually work on other projects that include singing.
Their last concert was on March 4, 2011 at 7:00 pm at the Fellowship Bible Church in Brentwood, Tennessee.
"pureNRG" (2006-2007).
Work on their self-titled album was in progress as early as 2006. Jordan Yates, the frontman, had originally come up with the idea of the album being titled "The 360 EP". Plans changed and on May 1, 2007, they released their self-titled album "pureNRG" on Fervent Records. The record spawned 3 singles; "360", "What If", and "Footloose". "Footloose" received heavy radio play on Radio Disney and other Pop format radio stations. The record was produced by Rob Hawkins and vocals were produced Mark Hammond, both of which were first timers in their association with the band. The band was extremely proud of the album and called it "A very good first impression".
"Here We Go Again" (2007-2008).
By the end of 2007, thoughts on another album had already come to mind and the group started writing songs. They were complete in mid-March and on April 29, 2008, they released their second album "Here We Go Again". It is somewhat of a cover album covering songs like "Call on Jesus" by Nicole C. Mullen and "More" by Matthew West. Jordan Yates, lead vocalist, said this about the album: "There's no reinvention here really, more like reiteration. I think we should give ourselves a pat on the back on this one." Despite being successful in both Christian and Mainstream markets, no concert or tour was used to promote the album. "The Precious Girls Club" edition was also released in 2008 with one new track, The Precious Girls Club Theme Song.
"A pureNRG Christmas" and "reNRGized" (2008).
PureNRG released a Christmas album "A pureNRG Christmas" around Labor Day 2008. The album was delayed at first due to both personal issues and busy-work with their previously released albums, but, after some consideration, was finally released. It marked the band's first Christmas album. In late 2008, they also released a remix album with the name "ReNRGized". The band described it as "very eccentric but still having the same kinda music style."
"The Real Thing", "Graduation: The Best Of pureNRG", and disbandment (2009-2011).
In mid-2009, after previous promotion of their new album, their last studio album "The Real Thing" was released. They released their final album "" on July 20, 2010. 
The band decided to disband sometime in late 2010. According to an interview with TVoneLife, reasons included "wanting to be kids again" and "get back into school and education". Also according to the same interview, Carolyne went into 9th grade, Caroline went into 10th grade, and Jordan went into 12th grade in the fall of 2010. Their mission was to "entertain educate and promote Christian values to young people. Using wholesome and uplifting lyrics in our music and with music and dance in order to provide positive role-models and we just really hope that we can showcase that being a child of God is just really so awesome and nobody can ever take that away from you no matter what happens and that’s just the whole reason that we get up on stage and perform for everybody and they really hope that we can get that message across through our music."
They went on a farewell tour in the fall of 2010, celebrating the 5 years of their lives they'd spent as pureNRG. All of the members said they were very sad to be disbanding, but they felt that God was calling them out.
Their last performance was at Fellowship Bible Church in Brentwood, Tennessee on March 4, 2011.
PureNRG officially disbanded on Friday, March 4, 2011.

Far Away Eyes

"Far Away Eyes" is the sixth track from rock and roll band The Rolling Stones's 1978 album "Some Girls."
Origin.
Mick Jagger and Keith Richards collaborated extensively on writing and composing the song, which was recorded in late 1977. A bootleg version with Richards singing exists. The Stones, longtime country music fans, incorporated many aspects of Bakersfield-style country music into this song. These included in particular Ronnie Wood's use of a pedal steel guitar for a solo and highlights, an instrument used on other songs from the album like "Shattered" and "When the Whip Comes Down." Also of note is the plodding rhythm of Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman. Richards performed acoustic and electric guitars as well as sharing piano duties with Jagger.
Content.
In the lyrics, the lowliness of life and the possibilities in finding love are dealt with:
The verses of the song are half sung, half spoken, with Jagger using a parodic Southern American English accent:
In a 1978 interview with "Rolling Stone" magazine, Jagger said, "You know, when you drive through Bakersfield on a Sunday morning or Sunday evening - I did that about six months ago - all the country music radio stations start broadcasting black gospel services live from L.A. And that's what the song refers to. But the song's really about driving alone, listening to the radio." On influences, Jagger stated "I wouldn't say this song was influenced specifically by Gram (Parsons). That idea of country music played slightly tongue-in-cheek - Gram had that in 'Drugstore Truck Drivin' Man', and we have that sardonic quality, too." Asked by the interviewer if the girl in the song was a real one, Jagger replied, "Yeah, she's real, she's a real girl."
Performances.
The Rolling Stones have performed "Far Away Eyes" sporadically since its introduction to their canon of work, most recently on the A Bigger Bang Tour in 2006. A captured performance appears on the 2008 live album "Shine a Light." On May 20, 2013, it was performed in Los Angeles as part of their "50 & Counting Tour."
Promotional video.
The official promotional video was directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who directed several other videos for the band, including those for "Start Me Up," "Jumping Jack Flash," and "Fool To Cry." Lindsay-Hogg also directed promotional videos for The Beatles and The Who.

Janus-Merritt Strategies

Janus-Merritt Strategies was a lobbying firm founded in 1997 by conservative activist Grover Norquist and then-lawyer David Safavian, who later became better known as the chief of staff in the General Services Administration and for his conviction in the Abramoff-Reed Indian lobbying scandal.
History.
The firm was originally founded as the Merritt Group, and later renamed Janus-Merritt Strategies (sometimes referred to as "Janus Merritt" or simply "Janus"). Janus (mythology) was the two-headed god of gates, doors, doorways, beginnings, and endings.
From the start, the firm had a fiercely ideological tenor: "We represent clients who really do have an interest in a smaller federal government", Safavian said in a 1997 interview with "Legal Times". "We're all very ideologically driven, and have a bias in favor of free markets." He went on: "We're not letting people who offer us money change our principles."
Distinguished clientele.
Over the next five years, the firm's clients included businesses like BP America, the U.S. division of British Petroleum. There were foreign companies like the Corporacion Venezolana de Cementos and Grupo Financiero Banorte. And there were gaming interests, including those of several Indian groups, such as the Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Council (a client the firm shared with Jack Abramoff), and the Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians, the National Indian Gaming Association (Janus lobbied for the latter two on the same issue, amendments to the Interior Appropriations Act that were considered anti-Indian.)
The firm was also registered as a lobbyist for the governments of Pakistan and Gabon, and for Pascal Lissouba, the corrupt former president of the Republic of the Congo.
Dissolution in 2001.
Safavian left Janus in January 2001 to become Chief of Staff for Representative Chris Cannon. In 2002, Janus itself was sold to Virginia-based Williams Mullen Strategies.
Controversial ties.
Perhaps the most controversial client of the lobbying firm was the American Muslim Council and Abdurahman Alamoudi, a fierce supporter of Hamas and Hezbollah. Senate disclosure reports on file show that for years Janus-Merritt registered as a lobbyist for Alamoudi. 
At a Senate confirmation hearing in April 2004, Safavian said that "To my knowledge, neither I nor Janus-Merritt did any work for Mr. Alamoudi." "I do not know why Mr. Alamoudi was erroneously listed in the client's lobby disclosure forms." More, "I do not believe Janus-Merritt received any funds from Mr. Alamoudi."
On December 17, 2001, eleven months after Safavian's departure, Janus resubmitted its disclosure forms. This time the name of Alamoudi had been replaced by the name of Dr. Jamal al Barzinji, who is also notable as a vice president of the International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT). Norquist has refused to release tax records of the firm for the period during which he and Safavian owned the company.
Safavian told the Senate that al Barzinji, not Alamoudi, was his client. "Al Barzinji," he said, "should have been listed as the client retaining the firm for work related to Malaysian political prisoner Anwar Ibrahim," referring to the deposed prime minister of Malaysia, who also was a co-founder of the IIIT. In fact, Barzinji had been listed as a contact, not a client, on all the disclosure forms.
On March 20, 2002, Barzinji's home was raided by a federal task force investigating terrorist finances. A federal affidavit identifies Barzinji as the ringleader of a group suspected of aiding terrorists.
At least one of the co-registrants with Alamoudi in his services on behalf of Norquist's Islamic Institute, Palestine-born Omar Nashashibi, went to work for Williams Mullen, serving as its director of government affairs.

Coccinella

Coccinella is the most familiar genus of ladybird (or, in North America, ladybug). The elytra of most species are of a red or orange colour, punctuated with black spots or bands. The genus occurs throughout the Northern Hemisphere, but has only 11 species native to North America, with far more in Eurasia.
Its name comes from Latin "coccineus", referring to the color scarlet.
Adults and larvae are voracious predators of aphids, and some species (e.g. "C. septempunctata") are used as biological control agents.

<doc id="9638698" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9638698" title="Amazonian Guard">
Amazonian Guard

The Amazonian Guard (also "the Amazons") was an unofficial name given by Western journalists to an all-female elite cadre of bodyguards officially known as ("al-rāhibāt al-thawriyyāt") "The Revolutionary Nuns", and sometimes also unofficially called "the Green Nuns", tasked with protecting the former leader of Libya, Muammar Gaddafi.
Formation.
The group was formed in the early 1980s, after Gaddafi's official resignation as Libyan head of state in favour of the title of "Brotherly Leader and Guide of the First of September Great Revolution of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya".
According to Joseph T. Stanik, Gaddafi reportedly employed a cadre of female bodyguards because he believed that an Arab gunman would have difficulty firing at women. However, it has also been submitted by other authors that Gaddafi's female bodyguards were, in reality, just an aspect of the dictator's well-known eccentric showmanship and his fondness of surrounding himself with young women. Gaddafi would usually travel with 15 of his Amazonian Guards assigned to security or housekeeping.
Training.
Candidates for the Amazonian Guard underwent extensive firearms and martial arts training at a special academy, were required to take an oath of chastity, and had to have been hand-picked by Gaddafi himself. Members of this bodyguard were allowed privileges such as dressing in Western-style fatigues and wearing makeup, or displaying Western hair styles and high heels.
Incidents.
In 1998, one of Gaddafi's female bodyguards was killed and seven others were wounded when Islamic fundamentalists in Libya ambushed Gaddafi's motorcade. It was claimed that the dead guard, Aisha, was Gaddafi's favourite and threw herself across Gaddafi's body to stop the bullets.
In November 2006, as Gaddafi arrived at Abuja Airport in Nigeria, with a 200-strong troop of heavily armed bodyguards, a diplomatic incident was caused as security officials tried to disarm them. Gaddafi furiously walked away, gesturing that he intended to cover the 40 km journey to the capital on foot, and could only be persuaded to yield after intervention by Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo, who by chance happened to be at the airport.
During the Libyan civil war, many were "hunted down" in retaliation of their role in executing rebel soldiers.
Abuse claims.
In the latter days of the Libyan civil war, accusations emerged from five members of the Amazonian Guard of rape and other abuse by the upper echelons of the Gaddafi government, which typically ranged from Gaddafi himself, to his sons, to high officials. Some Amazonian Guards have also claimed that they were forced to execute rebels or be killed themselves.

<doc id="9638713" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9638713" title="Privilege of Mielnik">
Privilege of Mielnik

The Privilege of Mielnik () was an act granted on October 25, 1501, at Mielnik by Poland's King Alexander Jagiellon. It substantially expanded the powers of the Senate and the magnates, at the expense of the king. Furthermore, it "de facto" introduced a republican form of government. The privilege was, however, not confirmed by the king after his election, and in 1504 was rejected by the Sejm (see "Łaski's Statutes").
After the death of Kazimierz Jagiellonczyk (1492), the personal union between the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was broken. New king of Poland was Jan Olbracht, while Lithuania was governed by his brother Aleksander. Following his father, Olbracht tried to win the support of the nobility, granting it several concessions in the Statutes of Piotrkow. The failed invasion of Moldavia in 1497 complicated internal situation of Poland, and strengthened the position of the magnates. At the same time, Lithuania was attacked by Ivan III of Russia, and in 1499 both nations signed the Union of Krakow and Vilna, which returned the Polish - Lithuanian alliance. In 1500 Jan Olbracht died, and on October 3, 1501, Aleksander Jagiellonczyk became the King of Poland. His election worsened the position of the Lithuanians, who agreed to the Union of Mielnik. Aleksander himself had to sign the Privilege of Mielnik, which limited his authority, and expanded the powers of the Senate:
The new political system of Poland, created by the privilege, was disliked by the nobility, which refused to pay taxes and to take part in the pospolite ruszenie. Starostas did not cooperate with senators, and during the 1504 Sejm, which took place in Piotrkow Trybunalski, Jan Laski initiated attack on the powerful Lesser Poland magnates. As a result, the nobility managed to regain their position, and during the 1505 Sejm in Radom, the Nihil novi act was introduced, which voided the Privilege of Mielnik.

Avoidance reaction

Avoidance reaction is used in the kingdom Protistas paramecium. This helps the cell move and causes other objects to bounce off of the cell's outer membrane.
Avoidance reaction occurs when the cell hits an obstruction, providing an anterior, mechanical stimulus:
- The cell will then reverse.
- It will then stop and rotate.
- Now facing a new direction, the cell will move off in that direction.
This process will continue until the cell is able to negotiate its way around the obstruction.
Movement of Paramecium cells is caused by control of calcium ions inside the cell and membrane potentials. The simplest explanation for the avoidance reaction is that membrane potential controls the influx of calcium ions, which regulates the beat frequency and angles of cilia on the surface of the cell.

The Witch and the Saint

The Witch and the Saint by Steven Reineke is a one movement symphonic band piece describing the lives of Helena and Sibylla; twin sisters born in Germany at the end of the 16th century. The piece has five distinct parts and has become a favorite among audiences and bands though the story behind it has been virtually forgotten.
The Music.
The Witch and the Saint has a running time of 10:22. It is a tone poem, composed in 2004. Overall, it’s an epic pieceanyone listening to it without knowing the story behind it would get the impression of a melancholy story being told through powerful musical phrases.
The piece opens with a thundering timpani triplet. A Gregorian chant type motif follows quietly and builds throughout the brass instrument section. The dark, threatening feel is broken suddenly by a melody portrayed by an oboe or flute solo as the bells join on after the new mood is established. That certain melody is recurrent and returns three more times in the entire piece. This first time, the melody is very airy. The eight-bar solo ends with the return of the ominous feel before the entire band is made to crescendo enormously.
From here, the piece speeds up dramatically. The primary melody is established by the first flutes, and the texture builds from here, growing progressively uneasy. The climax of the section is very Medieval sounding, and reaches an entirely new altitude not seen again in this piece. This section is noted for being difficult for the flutes and piccolo, as they are expected to play legato and slurred right at the top of their registers and intonation flaws are easily noticeable throughout due to the registers and chords in most parts.
The tempo and velocity of the piece dies down, and the slow melody repeats itself here, this time in a lower key and by the first flutes. To accompany this, a French horn melody is introduced, followed again by the previous melody in a different key.
The reminiscent fast section begins againthis time in a different key, with an altered melody. This section is far less angry, but houses a different sort of velocity, the emphasis on the low sections of the band as opposed to the higher sections the first time.
The final section of the piece comes in with the final occurrence of the slow melody. Note that the previous times evoked sadness, hopelessness and loneliness. This time, it’s heroic, and very full of hope. The band is playing with a thicker assortment of textures and counter-melodies. The piece, which by now seems to end on a happy note, drops the heroism and a few thundering angry notes roar, then suddenly fade into a melancholy echo of the very beginning.
Reception.
Plainly, this piece has gained much popularity by conductors, performers and audiences. Performers find the piece very satisfying as each instrument is given an independence. Instruments such as the tenor saxophone, bass clarinet and the horn have numerous solos, so much of the attention is dispersed evenly. Also, many different sections have their own part in the melody including the saxophone, the clarinet, and the percussion section (especially the chimes and bells). Conductors favor this piece due to challenging chords, strange time signatures, but most importantly, the independence of instruments normally overshadowed.
The story.
Helena and Sibylla were twins born in Germany in 1588. In that era twins were a bad omen and said to draw evil towards them. The girls also had the gift of foresight and were able to see that which had not yet come to pass. The suspicions of the general public were supported once the girls were old enough and began using their ability.
Sibylla was raised at home and it took very little time for the village to notice her unexplainable knowledge of the future. When they did, She was labeled witch and sorceress by the townsfolk and was hated and feared. She led a quiet, empty childhood being bullied and shunned by society.
Helena led a very different life. She was sent away to a convent to be raised in the church as a nun. Once her ability was discovered the community revered her and she was seen as a saint and sage by everyone and given the highest respect by even the wisest of men.
The two girls grew up facing their own challenges and struggles trying to fit into the societies in to which they had been placed. Helena continued her life as a saint and prophet and Sibylla learned to be a midwife and helped the people as best she could. She was eventually accused of being a witch and sent to jail for life. Helena learned of her sister’s trouble and raced back to the town they had been born in to rescue her sister.
Helena freed her sister from the jail and they ran off towards the forest. Before they got very far, however, they were captured. In her fear of the wrath of the villagers, and of the torment, Helena drank a poison and died in her sister’s arms. Sibylla’s heart was shattered, and while still grieving the loss of the only one in the world she had ever loved, she buried her sister’s body. She then rode off to find a place where she wouldn’t be known as a witch. She was never seen again.
Alternate: It is also said that Helena was burned at the stake for aiding a witch.
First Performance.
The piece was an ordered composition for the Youth Brass Orchestra of Ellwangen (Germany) and it was a present for their 50th anniversary. In 2004 they performed it on their anniversary concert.
In the United States the piece was first played by the Kirby School District 140 Symphonic Band in Tinley Park, Illinois in 2005.

United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy

The Joint Committee on Atomic Energy (JCAE) was a United States congressional committee that was tasked with exclusive jurisdiction over "all bills, resolutions, and other matters" related to civilian and military aspects of nuclear power from 1946 through 1977. It was established by the United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946, and was the overseer of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. For its broad powers, it is described as one of the most powerful congressional committees in U.S. history. It was the only permanent joint committee in modern times to have legislative authority.
The panel coupled these legislative powers with exclusive access to the information upon which its highly secretive deliberations were based. The joint committee was also entitled by statute to be kept "fully and currently informed" of all commission activities and vigorously exercised that statutory right, demanding information and attention from the executive branch in a fashion that arguably has no equivalent today.
One major power wielded by the JCAE was the "Legislative Veto." This unique power enabled the JCAE to influence policy decisions while matters were pending. This enabled the JCAE to act as a co-decision maker with the executive branch rather than only providing congressional oversight of actions that had already occurred. The legislative veto power was later found to be unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in 1983.
During the 1970s, the committee's role in shaping nuclear policy began to diminish after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was created to replace the Atomic Energy Commission. Congress soon transferred the bulk of the joint committee's jurisdiction over civilian nuclear power to other standing congressional committees in the House and Senate. The joint committee was finally abolished on August 5, 1977.
Committee members, 1946-1977.
The joint committee had equal representation between both the House and Senate, with 5 majority and 4 minority members from each house. The committee was chaired by a senator from the majority party until the 83rd Congress, when the chairmanship began to alternate between a majority representative and majority senator.

<doc id="9638737" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9638737" title="Rhabdodontidae">
Rhabdodontidae

Rhabdodontids were herbivorous ornithopod dinosaurs from the Cretaceous Period. Rhabdodontids were similar to large, robust "hypsilophodonts", with deep skulls and jaws. The family was first proposed by David B. Weishampel and colleagues in 2002. The rhabdodontids were defined as "the most recent common ancestor of "Zalmoxes robustus" and "Rhabdodon priscus" and all the descendants of this common ancestor". In 2005, Paul Sereno defined the family as "the most inclusive clade containing "Rhabdodon priscus" but not "Parasaurolophus walkeri"". The Rhabdodontidae includes the type genus "Rhabdodon", "Zalmoxes", "Mochlodon" and possibly "Muttaburrasaurus". Rhabdodontid fossils have been found in Europe and Australia in formations dating from the Early to Late Cretaceous, 100 to 66 million years ago. Ősi "et al." (2012) proposed that "Rhabdodon" underwent gigantism on the mainland, as opposed to "Zalmoxes" and "Mochlodon" experiencing nanism on island habitats. In 2013, Darren Naish discovered a tiny rhabdodont tibia from Sebeș, Romania, turning out to be the smallest known; a paper (Brusette et "al" 2013.) later in the same year identified it as "Zalmoxes", cf. "Z. shqiperorum".
Classification.
The Rhabdodontidae is a group of ornithopod dinosaurs, occupying family rank in linnean classification. See individual sections for more information.
Relationships.
The Rhabdodontidae are a group of ornithopod dinosaurs (See Ornithopoda, Ornithischia and Dinosaur articles for more inclusive information.), more specifically some of the basalmost iguanodonts. Most analyses find them to be more derived then "Tenontosaurus" but more basal then Elasmaria, Dryosauridae, "Camptosaurus", and more advanced Iguanodonts. Where the cut off line for rhabdodontidae is different depending on definition (See below.).
Inclusion.
As stated above, what is and isn't a rhabdodontid is different depending on definition. The original definition, the last common ancestor of "Zalmoxes robustus" and "Rhabdodon priscus", would not include "Muttaburrasaurus", as well as many other hypothetical rhabdodonts that would have existed during the ghost lineage. Pauls definition, the most inclusive clade containing "Rhabdodon priscus" but not "Parasaurolophus walkeri", would include the entire ghost lineage, and "Muttaburrasaurus". This ghost lineage lasts 90 million years without "Muttaburasaurus", and is still quite long including it, as it is the only rhabdodont known from this ghost lineage.
Phylogeny.
Most phylogenetic analysis's recover the two "Zalmoxes" species, and two "Mochlodon" species to be sister taxa, with "Rhabdodon" a close relative, the closest known; these include the analysis's from Ősi et al. (2012) and McDonald (2012a). Multiple analysis's also find "Muttaburrasaurus" to be sister taxon to this grouping, hence exclusion under the original definition; these analysis's include McDonald (2012a), and McDonald "et al."

Shuochang

Shuochang (; literally "speak and sing") is a form of traditional Chinese storytelling (or, more properly, "story-singing"), with many regional subgenres; it is also often referred to as "narrative." "Shuochang" performances usually intermix speaking and singing, and are accompanied by percussion instruments and sometimes also plucked or bowed string instruments.
"Shuochang" is most often performed by a solo male or female singer, although it may also be performed by two singers. The singers may provide their own accompaniment with hand-held percussion such as clappers (called "ban"; 板) or a small drum, or there may also be a small ensemble of one or two musicians.
The term "shuochang" has, since the late 20th century, also come to be used in China to refer to rap music.

Eden by-election, 1926

The Eden by-election of 1926 was a by-election for the Eden electorate during the 22nd New Zealand Parliament. The seat became vacant after the appointment of the sitting member, James Parr of the Reform Party as High Commissioner to London. Parr resigned on 26 March.
The by-election was held on 15 April 1926. Three candidates contested the seat. James Gunson the official "Reform" candidate had been Mayor of Auckland from 1915 to 1925. Ellen Melville stood as an "Independent Reform" candidate, claiming interference by the party organiser Albert Davy prevented her being selected as the official candidate. The Reform Party vote was split allowing the Labour candidate, Rex Mason, to win.
The Liberal Party was "so weak ... that they could not field a candidate.
Gunson was expected to "romp home" in the by-election; Reform had 55 seats. But with National (Liberal) having 11 seats plus two Liberal-leaning independents and Labour 12, Labour realised their chance to be the official Opposition and "threw their all" into their contest; helped by Melville standing as Independent Reform. "Never before or since have people in the sprawling electorate stretching from Eden Park, through Mount Albert, Pt Chevalier, New Lynn, Te Atatu, Massey and Hobsonville been wooed as assiduously as they were in March and April 1926" with party leaders Coats and Holland spending days in the electorate.
Harry Holland became Leader of the Opposition on 16 June 1926, as a result of the Eden by-election. Labour was now the second largest party in Parliament, replacing the Liberal Party (currently called the National Party ).

Nina Garbiras

Nina Garbiras (born 9 September 1964) is a United States actress. She is best known for her TV roles as Alexandra Brill in Fox Television's series "The Street", Beth Greenway in the Showtime series "Leap Years" and Andrea Little on the first season of NBC's "Boomtown". More recently, she is the owner of a specialist antique store in New York City.
Biography.
Garbiras was born in New York, United States and traces her heritage to the Basque reqion of northerneastern Spain and southwestern France. She grew up in New York and later in northern California. She attended Hyde Junior High School in Cupertino, California and went on to graduate from Cupertino High School. She read for her Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Santa Clara, a Jesuit university in California's Silicon Valley region, where she majored in psychology. She later studied dramatic art at the L'Ecole de Claude Mathieu in Paris, France. She lives in New York City.
Career.
Theatre.
Garbiras's professional stage acting career began in the chorus of a performance of "La traviata" at the Opera San José in San Jose, California. She also appeared in a production of "Jesus Christ Superstar" at De Anza College in Cupertino, California. Later, whilst living in Paris, France Garbiras appeared in small productions in that city playing the roles of Marie in "Night Games" and of Pamela in Peter Nichols's "A Day in the Death of Joe Egg" - both of which were staged at the tiny, 120-seat Theatre Clavel on the Rue Clavel. She also appeared as Roxanne in "Bajazet" at the Théâtre de la rue Olive.
Garbiras subsequently moved from France to London, England where she worked in fringe theatre appearing in "Prison’d in a Parlour" playing Lydia at the Southwark Playhouse, "London Stories" for Wink Productions playing Betty Fred Hiphop, "Waking Beauty" playing the Red Fairy for Arts Threshold, Babbett in Max Frisch's "The Fire Raisers" for the Break Out Theatre Company, and Lydia in "Spike Heels" for the Flipside Studio.
Upon her return to the United States, Garbiras understudied the roles of Josie Hines (played by Suzanne Cryer) and Sammii (played by Tony Award-winning actress Katie Finneran) in the Broadway production of Neil Simon's "Proposals" at the Broadhurst Theatre, New York which ran from 6 November 1997 to 11 January 1998.
Motion pictures.
Garbiras’ debut motion picture appearance was in the lead role of Catherine in director Sal Ciaverello's first professional film "Blue Shadows", a short film in the horror genre about monstrous devils that hide in moonlight shadows. It was shot on 16mm in 1994 but the film remained unreleased until 1997 when it was screened for the first time in New York. The film was acquired for release on DVD and VHS by EI Independent Cinema in 2001 who intended to include it in a compilation of short films called "Cutting Moments 2" but this intended release may not have eventuated.
Garbiras has also appeared in the French-language Swiss film "Fin de Siècle" playing the part of Alison, in New York documentary filmmaker Alison Swan's dramatic feature debut "Mixing Nia" which was shown at the 1998 New York Film Festival, and in Emily Baer's "Guy's Guide to Marrying Money". All those films were released in the same year - 1998. In 2000 she appeared in "You Can Count on Me", playing Nancy Everett, the pregnant wife of a character played by the actor Matthew Broderick
Garbiras’ biggest motion picture role to date is that of Janine Creedlow in "Bruiser" (2000) a horror picture directed by George A. Romero and screened at the Berlin Film Festival. In 2007 she appeared in "The Nanny Diaries" starring Scarlett Johansson and Alicia Keys and directed by Shari Springer Berman. Garbiras played the minor role of Miss Chicago.
"Bruiser", "The Nanny Diaries" and "You Can Count on Me" were widely available on DVD shortly after their release, whilst Garbiras’ other films are less readily available to her fans.
Television.
Garbiras has made numerous network television appearances in the United States. She appeared in Episode 5 of the sixth season of ABC's highly successful "NYPD Blue" which first aired in November 1998; as a guest on single episodes of NBC's "Lateline"; on ABC's "The Mike O’Malley Show" and in 2000 in "Grapevine" on CBS television. She also appeared in the pilot episodes of NBC's "Cold Feet" and Fox's "Traffic" and "The Only Living Boy in New York". None of those pilots became series but Garbiras's TV fortunes changed when she landed the role of Alexandra Brill on Fox's popular series "The $treet" (2000-1). She appeared as idealistic schoolteacher and later, best-selling author Beth Greenaway on "Leap Years" for the cable station Showtime in 2001 and later, in what is perhaps her most successful role, reporter Andrea Little on NBC/DreamWorks’ series "Boomtown" in 2002-3. Garbiras has described the Little character as "tough, articulate and headstrong". Her character did not return for the ill-fated second series of the show (it was cancelled before filming was completed and only a few episodes were screened) because the writers could not decide what to do with her character. In 2006 she appeared in a single episode of "Dr. Vegas", a CBS series starring the popular actor Rob Lowe.
Music.
Garbiras has also worked professionally as a singer. In addition to her roles in the opera "La traviata" and the musical "Jesus Christ Superstar" mentioned above, Garbiras sang with AOR group The Paul Godfrey Band in the late 1980s.
Publicity.
As is customary for stars of major network and cable TV shows in the United States, Garbiras was involved in a number of publicity events for the series in which she appeared. She attended the Showtime premiere of "Leap Years" and was interviewed by Bill Tush live on CNN television's "Showbiz This Week" promoting "The $treet" (the interview aired on 27 May 2000). To promote "Boomtown" she attended NBC's press tour at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Pasadena, California; the NBC Winter 2003 All Star Party at Los Angeles' Bliss Club, and the NBC Upfront event announcing NBC's primetime fall line-up for 2003 held at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Garbiras has been represented for the major part of her career by the well-known theatrical agents William Morris Agency.
Acclaim.
Garbiras’ portrayal of reporter Andrea Little in NBC/DreamWorks’ "Boomtown" drew immediate acclaim. "New York Magazine" commented that the character could be the first print journalist in a decade to be portrayed in prime-time television as having principles and decency. The magazine compared Garbiras favourably to Golden Globe Award-winning actress Mary-Louise Parker.
Garbiras was listed fourth in Netscape Celebrity's March 2005 ranking of "Top 10 Gutsy Gals" beating out better known TV actresses like Sarah Michelle Gellar ("Buffy the Vampire Slayer") and Jacqueline Obradors ("NYPD Blue"), amongst others.
A page on the social networking website Facebook called "Fans of Nina Garbiras" provides an unofficial community forum for her fans.
Second career.
In recent years, Garbiras has begun a second career as a small business owner. She opened an antique furniture store and design business on Ludlow Street in the lower East Side of Manhattan, New York, New York. The store specialises in English and French pieces. In August 2008 Garbiras told New York's "Daily News" that she had chosen the location of her store "to be close to the artists who live and create here." The store has subsequently moved to a location near Sixth Avenue in Brooklyn, New York and now places greater emphasis on its interior design service. Garbiras pursues this venture simultaneously with her acting career.

Atiyah Abd al-Rahman is thought to be the "Atiyah" who wrote a commanding letter to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in December 2005.
The State Department announcement said that Abd Al Rahman:
Atiyah had volunteered to travel to Afghanistan to fight against its Soviet occupiers in the 1980s, while he was still a teenager.
He was reported to have met and served under Osama bin Laden at that time. The "Washington Post" reported that another prominent Libyan exile, Noman Benotman, he was sent to Algeria in the 1990s to serve as an envoy to a group they said was then known as the Armed Islamic Group (GIA). He told the "Washington Post" that the GIA was suspicious of him, held him captive for months, and were considering killing him. He escaped with other captives, after five months of captivity, and, according to Benotman, ""He had a very bad experience, and I think is still having nightmares about it.""
He was killed in Pakistan by a CIA predator drone strike on August 22, 2011. Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri confirmed the death of Abd al-Rahman in a video on December 1, 2011.
Abd al-Rahman was previously reported dead in October 2010.

Thomas Hoyt Bryant (December 7, 1908 – May 28, 2010), known professionally as Slim Bryant, was an American country music singer-songwriter and guitarist born in Atlanta, Georgia. 
After spending nearly nine years working with Georgia fiddler Clayton McMichen as part of his band, the Georgia Wildcats, Bryant and most of the band separated from McMichen and moved to Pittsburgh in 1940 where he and the Georgia Wildcats became regulars on KDKA's new early morning "Farm Hour". He had worked at the station previously in 1931 with McMichen and in 1937 with his own short-lived group. The Wildcats became a Pittsburgh institution during World War II; and in 1949, performed on the first television program to air in that city, a musical variety show broadcast live on WDTV from Syria Mosque in Pittsburgh's Oakland section. WDTV became KDKA in January 1955. Having worked with several female singers, they added perky blonde vocalist Nancy Fingal. There were no other guests. Fingal was, Slim says, “A very talented girl, singin’ Sinatra tunes, that kind of stuff." 
He was the last surviving musician to have recorded with the legendary country singer Jimmie Rodgers, who died in 1933.
In 1932, Rodgers recorded Bryant's song "Mother, the Queen of My Heart," with Bryant accompanying him on guitar. Rodgers not only gave him writing credit, but had them list Bryant's name first, which is something many big stars refuse to do. He also recorded nine other songs with Rodgers. With his back-up group, the Wildcats, he wrote and recorded such novelty songs during his career as "Eeny Meeny Dixie Deeny," the closest he ever came to having a hit on the "Billboard" charts.
Bryant resided in the Pittsburgh suburb of Dormont, Pennsylvania. He was the subject of an extensive profile by Rich Kienzle in the January–February 2004 issue of "No Depression".

Rosa Lewis

Rosa Lewis, "née" Ovenden (1867 – 1952) was a British chef and owner of The Cavendish Hotel in London, located at the intersection of Jermyn Street and Duke Street,St. James. Known as the "Queen of Cooks", her culinary skills were highly prized by Edward VII, with whom she was rumoured to have had an affair in the 1890s. She was also called "The Duchess of Jermyn Street."
Life.
She was born in Leyton, the fifth of nine children. Her father was a watchmaker and later an undertaker. 
She left school at 12 to go into domestic service, working her way up to cook. She claimed that the great chef Auguste Escoffier, then at the Carlton Hotel, taught her about cooking. It was he who named her the "Queen of Cooks". One of her employers was Lady Randolph Churchill. One day, Rosa chased Lady Churchill's then ten-year-old, red-haired son Winston out of her kitchen, shouting "Hop it, copper knob."
She married butler Chiney Lewis in 1893. However, she did not think much of her husband. "My family said that if I did not marry Mr. Lewis they would shoot me. ... So we were married and I threw the ring at him at the church door and left him flat."
There are several versions describing how she met Edward VII. According to "Time" magazine, it was Lady Randolph who introduced them. However, the Cavendish Hotel biography states they first met while she was employed by Philippe, comte de Paris; he complimented her for the excellence of the dinner. In any case, he enjoyed her cooking very much. It was suspected by some that he helped her purchase the Cavendish Hotel in 1902. Another admirer of her culinary skills was Kaiser Wilhelm II, who presented her with his portrait. During World War I, she had it hung upside down in the men's toilet.
In 1914 it was reported that she 'cooked dinners for the regiments of the Household Cavalry... and at one time controlled the kitchen of White's Club', the later a reference to White's 'the oldest and most exclusive gentleman's club in London'.
Richard Hillary knew her, and wrote in "The Last Enemy":
Lewis died in her sleep on November 8, 1952 at the age of 85. She was buried in Putney Vale Cemetery.
The inscription at the foot of her tombstone, reads:
In fiction.
The 1976-77 BBC television series, "The Duchess of Duke Street", starring Gemma Jones, was loosely based on her life. It is said that some of the scenes in "Vile Bodies" by Evelyn Waugh also were inspired by the Cavendish Hotel under Lewis' management, in which she appears as her fictional counterpart Lottie Crump.
Plaque.
On 16 November 2006, Gemma Jones unveiled Westminster City Council's Commemorative Green plaque to Lewis, near the entrance to the old hotel in Jermyn Street. The plaque was the 68th in the Scheme. It honoured Lewis as a Chef de Cuisine and Hotelier.

Midleton Very Rare

Midleton Very Rare is a premium blended Irish whiskey, produced by Irish Distillers at their distillery, in the East Cork town of Midleton, from which it gets its name. Midleton Very Rare has received strong reviews from a number of sources. 
History.
It was launched in 1984 to celebrate the whiskeys produced in Midleton. A new vintage is released every year. Each bottle is individually numbered and signed by the Master distiller. It is distilled at the same location as the more affordable Jameson's whiskey.
Blend.
As the name suggests, the whiskey is produced in limited quantities. Only 50 casks are released each year, it is therefore both expensive and collectible. The whiskeys used in the blend are handpicked by the Master distiller, all are triple distilled and have aged between 12 and 25 years in individually selected Bourbon or Sherry casks. As a new vintage is created each year, each differs slightly and has its own character.
Reviews.
Midleton Very Rare has received strong reviews from a number of sources. It was awarded a Double Gold rating (meaning unanimous gold medal from all judges) at the 2007 San Francisco World Spirits Competition after having won only Gold in 2005. It was a finalist in the Ultimate Spirits Challenge 2011, where it earned a rating of 'Extraordinary - Ultimate Recommendation'. The prior year, the 2008 vintage was awarded the Chairman's Trophy (top prize for its class) in this same contest. It was also a finalist in the Ultimate Spirits Challenge 2011. It currently holds a rating of 93 on 'For Peat' Sake'.

Golden gimmick

The Golden Gimmick refers to a foreign tax credit deal enacted in November 1950 by the US Government under president Harry Truman between King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia and the Arabian-American Oil Company (ARAMCO), a consortium comprising Standard Oil of California (Socal), Standard Oil of New Jersey (Exxon), Standard Oil of New York (Mobil) and Texaco. King Ibn Saud was being influenced by Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso of Venezuela who cut a similar 50/50 deal with New Jersey Standard Oil and Royal Dutch Shell. This 50/50 deal accorded the American oil companies a tax break equivalent to 50% of their profits on oil sales, the other 50% was diverted to King Ibn Saud via the US Treasury. The King agreed to this 50/50 splitting of Aramco's oil profits instead of nationalizing Aramco's oil facilities on Saudi soil. Venezuela eventually led the effort in forming OPEC and Saudi Arabia gained full control of Aramco by 1980.

Slave Trade Act of 1794

The Slave Trade Act of 1794 was a law passed by the United States Congress that limited American involvement in the trade of human cargo. This was the first of several acts of Congress that eventually stopped the importation of slaves to the United States. The owning of slaves would later be made illegal in the U.S. by the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865.
Passage.
The bill was introduced during the 3rd Congress that convened December 2, 1793. This bill was then passed March 22, 1794, with the title: An Act to prohibit the carrying on the Slave Trade from the United States to any foreign place or country.
Text of the law.
""Section 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That no citizen or citizens of the United States, or foreigner, or any other person coming into, or residing within the same, shall, for himself or any other person whatsoever, either as master, factor or owner, build, fit, equip, load or otherwise prepare any ship or vessel, within any port or place of said United States, nor shall cause any ship or vessel to sail from any port or place within same, for the purpose of carrying on any trade or traffic in slaves, to any foreign country; or for the purpose of procuring, from any foreign kingdom, place or country, the inhabitants of such kingdom, place or country, to be transported to any foreign country, port, or place whatever, to be sold or disposed of, as slaves: And if any ship or vessel shall be so fitted out, as aforesaid, for the said purposes, or shall be caused to sail, so as aforesaid, every ship or vessel, her tackle, furniture, apparel and other appurtenances, shall be forfeited to the United States; and shall be liable to be seized, prosecuted and condemned, in any of the circuit courts or district court for the district where said ship or vessel may be found and seized.""
Section 2 allows for forfeiture by owners and the possibility of a $2,000 fine. Section 3 affected foreign merchants. Section 4 forfeited any slaves on board the ship and a fine of $200 per slave. In short, the Act limited the international slave trade to foreign ships, and foreign ships using United States' ports had to agree not to export from U.S. ports.
First prosecution.
In August 1795, Providence, Rhode Island merchant John Brown conspired to trade in slaves. Brown conspired with a Captain Peleg Wood with the ship "Hope" to be used in the slave trade. By November the "Hope" was engaged in the slave trade, and in March 1796, the owners of the ship were fined by Rhode Island the amount of £200 for trading in slaves, which had been outlawed in that state. On a voyage in 1796 Brown’s ship traveled to Havana, Cuba with 229 slaves. This trading voyage led to a trial of Brown in 1796 for violating the statute. Brown became the first American tried in federal court under the Slave Trade Act of 1794. Then on October 5, 1797, Brown lost his case and was forced to forfeit the ship in accordance with the law.

Rachel's Challenge

Rachel's Challenge is a non-profit, non-religious, non-political organization. It is led by Darrell Scott and his wife Sandy.
Origin.
Rachel Scott was among the students killed during the Columbine High School shooting in 1999. Darrell Scott, Rachel's father, established Rachel's Challenge to perpetuate his daughter's example and the two-page "Code of Ethics" she wrote a month before her death at the hands of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.
Mission.
The organization's mission statement is to "motivate, educate and bring positive change to many young people". The Rachel’s Challenge presentations are given in schools and communities by members of her family and other speakers, using video footage of the Columbine High School massacre and its aftermath, combined with Rachel Scott’s drawings and writings, in a campaign to quell school violence, bullying, and teen suicide. As of 2009, Rachel's Challenge has developed a team of 30 speakers addressing young people in schools and colleges worldwide about Rachel's example. The Rachel's Challenge program includes establishing "Friends of Rachel" clubs in schools, following the initial presentation, to sustain the campaign's goals on a long-term basis. Schools around the country have incorporated Rachel's challenge into their own clubs bringing the message to their students.
Darrell Scott.
Darrell Scott has co-authored three books about his daughter's life and her impact, urging students to practice compassion and kindness. "Newsweek" reported that he and the organization have "reached out to thousands of schools to deliver a 'chain reaction' of hope through school assemblies, workshops and outreach programs." Scott told "Newsweek", "...principals and teachers always need to be on the lookout for that kid who's isolated, or that's quiet, who always stays to himself, because that's typically the type of kid who ends up exploding. They also need to create an atmosphere in the school where students share with someone if they ever hear or see a threat. We know there have been numerous school shootings prevented because a student saw another student writing that he wanted to kill someone or something like that. I think that taking every single threat of any kind seriously is of utmost importance, and again to me it's cultivating an atmosphere, a climate and a culture where everyone's accepted. Because when people feel accepted they're not going to do something like Eric and Dylan Columbine perpetrators did."
Craig Scott.
Rachel Scott’s younger brother Craig, a 16-year old Columbine High School sophomore at the time of the shootings, was physically unharmed but witnessed several classmates being killed in the school library as he huddled under a table with two friends, Isaiah Shoels and Matthew Kechter. The next day, he was interviewed at length by Katie Couric on the "Today show". The tearful interview, which NBC did not interrupt with normally scheduled station breaks, was described a year later by "USA Today" as "one of the most indelible moments of the tragedy". Craig wrote of his sister Rachel, "...her love for people was less conditional than anyone I knew... It didn't matter to her what you looked like or who your friends were. Another thing I liked and respected so much was that she made it clear... what her beliefs were".
Craig continues to make frequent speaking appearances on behalf of Rachel's Challenge, urging teens to strive for a classroom "atmosphere of kindness and compassion" to stem school violence. He is also periodically interviewed on various television programs, such as "20/20", "Dateline NBC", and the "Today" show, to discuss the loss of his sister and his difficult recovery from the traumatic ordeal he experienced as an eyewitness to the murderous rampage.
Updates.
At the White House "Conference on School Safety" held in Washington, DC, on October 10, 2006, Craig Scott addressed the President of the United States, the U.S. Attorney General, and the Secretary of Education, saying, in part, "Kindness and compassion can be the biggest antidotes to anger and hatred, and I believe the biggest antidotes to violence. We've seen bullying stopped, incidents where a student came up with hit lists or plans to shoot up his school, and told either the speaker or told the teacher about their plans, but had a change of heart. How have we done it? We've done it with a simple story of a young girl who believed in compassion, Rachel Joy Scott. But my sister is not the only one who believes in kindness, and she's not been the only one in her brave stance against the injustice willing to stand up for the one who gets put down in school, to sit by the student that sits all alone at lunch, and to talk to or reach out to the one who is consistently ignored or made fun of. She literally has inspired millions of people to continue the chain reaction she started...".
In the aftermath of the April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech massacre, Darrell and Craig Scott were interviewed on various television programs, such as "Showbiz Tonight", "The Oprah Winfrey Show", "Fox & Friends", and "Geraldo at Large", to share their thoughts about school violence and to remember Rachel Scott near the eighth anniversary of the Columbine tragedy. Craig Scott urged viewers on "The Oprah Winfrey Show" two days later to refrain from too much focus on the shooter, saying "I have found students that actually idolize the two shooters at Columbine... We've focused on my sister, who's so compassionate and kind. And from that, that's the opposite of that anger and hatred."
On April 20, 2009, the tenth anniversary of the Columbine shootings, Darrell Scott told NBC interviewer Natalie Morales on the "Today" show, "We've seen a lot of lives changed from her story and our program, Rachel's Challenge, has touched literally 13 million lives over the last ten years". He said that from September 2008 to April 2009, his organization received 105 emails from teens dissuaded from suicide because of attending a Rachel's Challenge program. In a separate interview aired the same day, Craig Scott told Morales that, "I meet a lot of hurting students out there and I share with them my hurtful story, but I'm not just carrying a sob story around ... I'm trying to share with them some of the things that I learned to get through it and to be a better person because of it". As of 2008, Craig Scott has spoken to more than one million people in making appearances for Rachel's Challenge, while pursuing a career in filmmaking. He hopes to produce inspirational films and is on the board of directors of the American Screenwriters Association.

Robert Crawford (Australian poet)

Robert Crawford (29 October 1868 - 13 January 1930) was an Australian poet.
Crawford was born in Doonside, New South Wales, the son of Robert Crawford senior, and was educated at The King's School, Parramatta, and the University of Sydney. Crawford settled on a farm as his forefathers had done, but not being successful, became a clerk in Sydney and afterwards had a typewriting business. Some of Crawford's poems were published in "The Bulletin" and other periodicals. Crawford is believed to have been the first prize-winning haku poet published in Australia, in "The Bulletin" on 12 August 1899.
In 1904 a small collection, "Lyric Moods:Various Verses", was published in Sydney. An enlarged edition was later published in Melbourne retitled simply "Lyric Moods" (1909). In 1921 another volume, "Leafy Bliss", was published, and an enlarged edition appeared three years later. Crawford died suddenly at Lindfield, Sydney, on 13 January 1930. 
Not a great deal is known about Crawford; he was short of stature, poetical in spirit. He mixed little in literary circles and seems to be forgotten a few years after his death. The statement that he was educated at The King's School originally appeared in the "Bookfellow", and may have come direct from Crawford. If so there is no reason to doubt it, yet in the records of The King's School of his period the only R. Crawford is listed as Richard Crawford. It was also not possible to identify him positively with the Robert James G. W. Crawford who graduated B.A. at the University of Sydney in 1912, when the poet was about 44 years of age. Crawford is represented in some of the anthologies, and A. G. Stephens thought highly of his work. His work has a delicate charm and, though at times one fears it will not rise above merely pretty verse, in some of his quatrains and lyrics Crawford does succeed in writing poetry of importance. Perhaps, as Stephens once suggested, he may be better appreciated in the 21st century.

Real-time rendering

Real-time rendering is one of the interactive areas of computer graphics, it means creating synthetic images fast enough on the computer so that the viewer can interact with a virtual environment. The most common place to find real-time rendering is in video games. The rate at which images are displayed is measured in frames per second (frame/s) or Hertz (Hz). The frame rate is the measurement of how quickly an imaging device produces unique consecutive images.
The graphics rendering pipeline.
Graphics rendering pipeline is known as the rendering pipeline or simply the pipeline. It is the foundation of real-time graphics. Its main function is to generate, or render, a two-dimensional image, given a virtual camera, three-dimensional objects (an object that has width, length, and depth), light sources, lighting models, textures, and more.
Architecture.
The architecture of the real-time rendering pipeline can be divided into three conceptual stages as shown as in the figure below. These stages include application, geometry, and rasterizer. This structure is the core which is used in real-time computer graphics applications.
Application stage.
The application stage is driven by the application where "it begins the image generation process that results in the final scene of frame of animation. Therefore creating a base filled with simple images, that then later on build up into a bigger, more clear image". The application is implemented in the software thus giving the developers total control over the implementation in order to change the performance. This stage may, for example, contain collision detection, speed-up techniques, animations, force feedback, etc. One of the processes that is usually implemented in this stage is collision detection. Collision detection is usually includes algorithms that detects whether two objects collide. After a collision is detected between two objects, a response may be generated and sent back to the colliding objects as well as to a force feedback device. Other processes implemented in this stage included texture animation, animations via transforms, geometry morphing, or any kind of calculations that are not performed in any other stages. At the end of the application stage, which is also the most important part of this stage, the geometry to be rendered is fed to the next stage in the rendering pipeline. These are the rendering primitives that might eventually end up on the output device, such as points, lines, and triangles, etc.
Geometry stage.
The geometry stage is responsible for the majority of the per-polygon operations or per-vertex operation; it means that this stage computes what is to be drawn, how it should be drawn, and where it should be drawn. In some case, this stage might be defined as one pipeline stage or several different stages, mainly due to the different implementation of this stage. However, in this case, this stage is further divided into different functional group.
Model and view transform.
Before the final model is shown on the output device, the model is transformed into several different spaces or coordinate systems. That is, when an object is being moved or manipulated, the object's vertices are what are being transformed.
Lighting.
In order to make the model to have a more realistic appearance, one or more light sources are usually equipped during the scene of transforming the model. However, this stage cannot be reached without completing the 3D scene being transformed into the view space; the view space is where the camera is placed at the origin and aimed in a way that the camera is looking in the direction of the negative z-axis, with the y-axis pointing upwards and the x-axis pointing to the right.
Projection.
There are two types of projection, orthographic (also called parallel) and perspective projection. Orthographic projection is used to represent a 3D model in a two dimensional (2D) space. The main characteristic of orthographic projection is that the parallel lines remain parallel even after the transformation without distorting them. Perspective projection is where when a camera is farther away from the model, the smaller the model it appears. Essentially, perspective projection is the way that we see things from our eyes.
Clipping.
Clipping is the process of removing primitives that are outside of the view box in order to continue on to the rasterizer stage. Primitives that are outside of the view box are removed or "clipped" away. Once the primitives that are outside of the view box are removed, the primitives that are still inside of the view box will be drawn into new triangles to be proceeded to the next stage.
Screen mapping.
The purpose of screen mapping, as the name implies, is to find out the coordinates of the primitives that were determined to be on the inside of the view box in the clipping stage.
Rasterizer stage.
Once all of the necessary steps are completed from the two previous stages, all the elements, including the lines that have been drawn and the models that have been transformed, are ready to enter the rasterizer stages. Rasterizer stage means turning all of those elements into pixels, or picture elements, and adding color onto them.

McGregor High School

McGregor High School (MHS) is a public high school located in McGregor, Minnesota. It is K-12 and houses about 500 students and 50 faculty. The school colors are red, white and black and the school mascot is Mercury, the Roman god of speed. 
MHS made the news in 1997 when it was discovered that the business manager and another employee had been embezzling funds, leaving a deficit of about $550,000. To keep the school open, the community voted to raise property taxes, and in three years' time administrators managed to balance the budget. They also raised money for large building projects including new classrooms and an auditorium.

<doc id="9639221" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9639221" title=".223 Winchester Super Short Magnum">
.223 Winchester Super Short Magnum

The .223 WSSM (Winchester Super Short Magnum) is a .224 caliber rifle cartridge created by Winchester and Browning based on a shortened version of the Winchester Short Magnum case.
History.
The .223 WSSM was introduced in 2003 by the Browning Arms Company, Winchester Ammunition, and Winchester Repeating Arms Company. It is a shortened .300 WSM (Winchester Short Magnum) case necked down to accept a .224 caliber bullet. The .223 designation is a reference to the popular .223 Remington. It is currently the fastest production .22 caliber round in the world with muzzle velocities as high as 4,600 feet per second (1,402 meters per second; about Mach 4.1). 
Controversy.
Even before the cartridge was commercially introduced, it was claimed that it would be extremely hard on barrels, with high wear leading to short barrel life. Another criticism is that although the round is suited for long distances range vermin hunting, it is not good for medium game any farther than 200 yards. 
The Winchester made Model 70 in .223 WSSM has not been revived in the new Browning-made Winchester Model 70s, but Browning has chosen to use chrome-lined barrels on all of its guns chambered for .223 WSSM and has introduced the .223 WSSM cartridge as a chambering in its A-bolt rifles. Browning rejects the charge that the .223 WSSM round is especially hard on barrels: "The 223 and 243 WSSM cartridges are said to 'burn up' barrels in as little as 300 rounds. Nothing could be further from the truth."
Advantages.
According to Browning, the .223 WSSM offers a gain, 
with a bullet, over the standard .223 Rem. 
It also offers a gain over the 22-250, a popular vermin round.
This comes out to a gain over a standard .223 Rem, and a gain over the 22-250.

Qin Hui

Qin Hui (1090–1155) was a Chancellor of the Song dynasty in Chinese history. He is widely regarded as a traitor for his part in the persecution and execution of Yue Fei, a general who fought for the Song against the Jin dynasty during the Jin–Song Wars. Modern historians however, have placed as much blame (if not more) on the reigning Emperor Gaozong himself.
History.
Born in Jiangning (present day Nanjing, Jiangsu), Qin won Jinshi in the Imperial examination of 1115. During the Northern Song dynasty, Qin was an activist against the invasion by the Jin dynasty in the Jin–Song Wars. He was captured along with Emperor Qinzong and Emperor Huizong in the Jingkang Incident.
Some years later, he suddenly returned from captivity in the Jin empire to the capital of Emperor Gaozong. He claimed some sort of miraculous escape but quite some people expressed doubt regarding his story. However, he quickly won the emperor's favor and became the Chancellor of the Southern Song empire in 1131. In the next year, he was removed from the position after impeachment. After some Song victories in 1137, the Jin empire was forced to reopen peace talks, and Qin gained power as a pacifist.
With Qin's help, the emperor suppressed the war hawks and signed the Treaty of Shaoxing with the Jin empire. The emperor basically accepted the status of being a vassal of the Jin empire publicly. To open the peace talks, the national hero general Yue Fei, who was famous for his military successes against the Jurchen people, was first removed from his position, then imprisoned, and then killed in prison. The killing of Yue Fei is one of the most famous evil acts by government minister in the whole history of the Song dynasty. Qin became notorious, and (after he lost power and died) some people suspected that he was a traitor. 
Qin removed all his political opponents from the government by use of his control over the Imperial Censorate. Most of his enemies were exiled far to the south, several in fact died on Hainan Island. He believed that the schools should only teach "acceptable ideas" and practiced a strong form of censorship and thought control over the Imperial university. 
After his death and the resignation of the old emperor, the new Emperor Xiaozong of Song pardoned most of Qin's political enemies, including a posthumous pardon for Yue Fei. From that point on, Qin was constantly vilified by Chinese historians. He became one of the most important examples in Chinese history of an evil minister.
Cultural echo.
"The Story of Yue Fei" states that after having Yue Fei, Yue Yun, and Zhang Xian arrested under false charges, Qin and his wife, Lady Wang (), were sitting by the "eastern window", warming themselves by the fire, when he received a letter from the people calling for the release of the general. Qin was worried because after nearly two months of torture, he could not get Yue Fei to admit the false charges of treason and would eventually have to let him go. However, after a servant girl brought fresh oranges into the room, Lady Wang devised a plan to execute the general. She told Qin to slip an execution notice inside the skin of an orange and send it to the examining judge. This way, the general and his companions would be put to death before the Emperor or Qin himself would have to rescind an open order of execution. This conspiracy became known as the “East-Window Plot”. An anonymous novel was written about this called the "Dong Chuang Ji" ("Tale of the Eastern Window") during the Ming dynasty. 
When asked by General Han Shizhong what crime Yue had committed, Qin Hui replied, "Though it isn't sure whether there is something that he did to betray the dynasty, maybe there is.” The phrase "unneeded" () has entered the Chinese language as an expression to refer to fabricated charges.
For their part in Yue Fei's death, iron statues of Qin Hui, Lady Wang, and two of Qin Hui's subordinates, Moqi Xie and Zhang Jun, were made to kneel before Yue Fei's tomb (located by Hangzhou's West Lake). For centuries, these statues have been cursed, spat and urinated upon by young and old. But now, in modern times, these statues are protected as historical relics. There is a poem hanging on the gate surrounding the statues, it reads: 
""The green hill is fortunate to be the burial ground of a loyal general, the white iron was innocent to be cast into the statues of traitors.""
The story of Qin and his wife are also said to be the origin of Youtiao.
Folktales.
Xiyoubu.
"Xiyoubu" (西遊補 - "Supplement to the Journey to the West", 1640) - A Ming dynasty addendum to the famous Chinese novel "Journey to the West", which takes place between the end of chapter 61 and the beginning of 62. In the novel, The Monkey King faces a representation of his own carnal desires and is trapped inside of a tower full of mirrors, each with its own powers. One mirror causes him to travel forward in time, from the Tang to the Song dynasty. There, some junior devils appear and tell him that the ruler of the underworld King Yama has recently died of an illness, and so Monkey must take his place until a suitable replacement can be found. Monkey ends up judging the fate of the recently deceased Prime Minister Qin Hui. He tortures Qin into confessing his sins. These tortures include having millions of embroidery needles shoved into his flesh, being ground into paste, thrown onto a mountain of swords and spears, hacked into bits, forced to drink human puss, and his rib cage ripped apart to give him the appearance of a dragon fly. A demon is charged with using his magic breath to "blow" Qin back into his proper form. Monkey finally sends a demon to heaven to retrieve a powerful magic gourd that sucks anyone, who speaks before it, inside, and melts them down into a bloody stew. He uses this gourd for Qin's final punishment. Meanwhile, Monkey invites the ghost of Yue Fei to the underworld and takes him as his third master. (He claims this completes his lessons on the three religions since: 1) the immortal Subhodi taught him Taoist magic 2) the Tang Monk taught him Buddhist restraint and 3) Yue Fei taught him Confucian ideals.) He entertains Yue Fei until Qin has been reduced to liquid and offers the general a cup of Qin's "blood wine." Yue, however, refuses on the grounds that drinking it would sully his soul. Monkey then does an experiment where he makes a junior devil drink the wine. Sometime later, the devil, apparently under the evil influence of the blood wine, murders his personal religious teacher and escapes into the "gate of ghosts," presumably being reborn into another existence. Yue Fei then takes his leave to return to his heavenly abode. Monkey sends him off with a huge display of respect by making all of the millions of denizens of the underworld kowtow before him.
Qin Hui The Stinker.
The following is a folktale about one of Qin's descendants: 
During the Ming dynasty, the new Provincial Governor-General of Hangzhou, who was a direct descendant of Qin and Madam Wang, had both iron statues thrown into the West Lake under cover of night. The next day, the lake turned pitch-black and smelt of vomit. The townsfolk realized that the lake’s condition coincided with the statues' disappearance. When Official Qin arrived on the scene, the people questioned him about his relationship with Qin. Because he knew the statues had sunk to the bottom of the lake, he boasted, "If anyone can really scoop the statues out of the lake, this official is waiting to resign and ask for punishment." At that exact moment, the murky water became clear, and the statues drifted ashore as if propelled by an invisible force. The cowardly official bolted for his sedan when he saw this miraculous sight. The townsfolk pelted his sedan with rocks as he fled, many of them ripping through the curtain, giving him huge lumps on his head. That night, Official Qin escaped Hangzhou, never to be heard from again.
The mad monk sweeps Qin out of the temple.
During the Southern Song dynasty there were two famous Buddhists named the "Crazy monk" Ji Gong and the "Mad Monk" Fengbo. Fengbo lived during the time of Yue Fei and became famous for "Sweeping Qin Hui’s face with a broom". The story is told after having Yue Fei imprisoned on false charges, Qin went to the Lingyin Temple to have his fortune read. There he was confronted by a laughing Feng Bo who asked, "Cao Cao was once a big hero, but where is he today?" The Prime Minister asked him what he meant in confusion. Fengbo said,
Qin countered, "Who is that pillar of the country?" "General Yue Fei!" screamed Fengbo. When Qin seemed unaffected by his words, Fengbo laughed and said, "What a fool! Repent now before it is too late." He then grabbed a broom and raked it across the Prime Minister’s face and quickly ran off. Feeling embarrassed, Qin returned to the palace a defeated man.
The boldness of the monk caught the attention of the common folk. It is said he would appear in crowded areas and begin to sweep the floor, even in the cleanest of places, and proclaim "sweeping Qin" as a reminder to the people that they should band together to eliminate the traitor Qin from office. The "Mad Monk" was later raised to the level of Arahat.
The statues of the "Mad and Crazy Monks" were often seen together in various temples throughout the Southern Song dynasty. There are two such statues of these arahats in the "Da Xiong Temple Hall" of Zhan Tan Forest on the Jiu Hua Mountain. One of them is the "Crazy Monk" Ji Gong in the form of a deity and the other is the "Mad Monk" Fengbo holding a duster in one hand and a broom under his left armpit, standing ever ready to give the wicked Prime Minister another sweep.
This is a derivative of an episode from The Story of Yue Fei, which mentions no "sweeping" at all. The fortuneteller's name was "Xie Renfu of Chengdu" and he told the fortunes of both Emperor Gaozong and Qin Hui, who were in disguise, in the "Dragon's Intonation Monastery". When Qin returned to the palace, he sent men to arrest the fortuneteller, but he had already fled the city, out of fear once he discovered who they really were.

Georges Girard

Georges Girard (February 4, 1888 – February 20, 1985) was a French bacteriologist born in Isigny-sur-Mer, Calvados.
He studied medicine in Bordeaux, earning his bachelor's degree in 1911, and his medical doctorate in 1913. During World War I he was a doctor of colonial troops, receiving the Croix de Guerre in 1916. From 1917 to 1920 he was a physician in charge of the bacteriology laboratory at the hospital in Diego-Suarez. In 1922 he was appointed director of the Institute of Bacteriology of Madagascar (Institut Pasteur of Antananarivo), a position he maintained until 1940..
During his tenure in Madagascar, Girard conducted studies of typhoid, tuberculosis, leprosy and especially bubonic plague. Beginning in 1898 there had been sporadic outbreaks of the plague in the country, and none of the previously developed vaccines were strong or durable enough to handle the disease. In the 1930s, Girard and his assistant, Jean-Marie Robic developed an anti-plague vaccine known as the "EV strain". The EV strain had excellent results against the plague, and inoculation was carried out by Colonial Army medical officers and auxiliary Malagasy physicians. For decades afterwards this strain has been used worldwide to combat bubonic plague.
In 1941 he succeeded Edouard Dujardin-Beaumetz (1868-1947) as director of plague services at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Here he conducted research of pasteurellosis, tularaemia and the bacillus- "Yersinia pseudotuberculosis". From 1954 to 1958 he was president of the "Société de pathologie exotique"

Big Wheel is a studio album by Australian rock synthpop band, Icehouse, which was released by dIVA Records - founder Iva Davies' own label - and Massive Records. It was recorded at Davies' home in Whale Beach during 1993 with Davies on vocals, guitar, bass guitar and keyboards, David Chapman on guitar, keyboards and backing vocals, and Paul Wheeler on drums, percussion and backing vocals. "Big Wheel" peaked at #46 and was their first studio album not to reach the Top Ten on the Australian album charts. The album was digitally remastered by Davies and Ryan Scott with five bonus tracks added for the 2002 re-release by Warner Music Australia.
Singles.
"Satellite" and "Big Wheel" were released as singles in 1993, "Invisible People" followed in 1994. Of those three only "Satellite" reached the Australian charts, peaking at 83. The "Big Wheel" single featured remixes by Bill Laswell (featuring fellow guitarist Buckethead) and General Dynamics (guitars by Jon Ingoldsby) as well as a demo version of the song and "Turn it Round".
Reception.
Reviewed in Rolling Stone Australia at the time of release, "Big Wheel" was described as tougher-sounding and less commercial than the band's previous releases, and arguably their best recording to date. The reviewer noted the "early-Seventies glam and Enoesque atmospherics," and praised the "sonic immediacy" of the "largely live performances."

William Cowper (Dean of Sydney)

William Macquarie Cowper (known in his youth as Macquarie; 3 July 1810 – 14 June 1902) was an Australian Anglican archdeacon and Dean of Sydney.
Cowper was born in Sydney, the son of the Revd William Cowper, assistant colonial chaplain, and his second wife, Ann (née Barrell) . Educated by his father and at the University of Oxford, he graduated BA in 1833 and MA in 1835. He returned to Australia in 1836 and was made chaplain at Port Stephens, New South Wales where he remained for 20 years. He then became Acting Principal of Moore Theological College, Sydney, for a few months after the college opened at Liverpool on 1 March 1856.
In 1858 Cowper succeeded his father at St Philip's Church, Sydney. Later the same year he was appointed Archdeacon and Dean of Sydney. He several times acted as commissary for bishops Frederic Barker and Alfred Barry during their absences in England. He was admired for his piety and kindliness. He died, aged 91, on 14 June 1902 and was buried at St Jude's cemetery, Randwick. He was married twice and was survived by his children. He published "Episcopate of the Right Reverend Frederic Barker, D.D." in 1888 and his autobiography, "The Autobiography and Reminiscences of William Macquarie Cowper", was published soon after his death.

Heat-labile enterotoxin

Heat-labile enterotoxin is a type of labile toxin found in "Escherichia coli" and "Bacillus cereus".
"Escherichia coli".
The heat labile enterotoxin is inactivated at high temperatures.
It acts similarly to the cholera toxin by raising cAMP levels through ADP-ribosylation of the alpha-subunit of a Gs protein leading to the constitutive activation of adenylate cyclase. Elevated cAMP levels stimulate The activation of the CFTR channel thus stimulating secretion of Chloride ions and water from the enterocyte into the gut lumen. This ionic imbalance causes watery diarrhea.
In addition to its effects on chloride secretion, which involve the same steps as the effects of cholera toxin, heat-labile enterotoxin binds additional substrates: lipopolysaccharide on the surface of "E. coli" cells and A-type blood antigens. The importance of these binding events is not yet known.

William Cowper (Archdeacon of Cumberland)

William Cowper (28 December 1778 – 6 July 1858) was an English-born Anglican cleric in Australia who was the Archdeacon of Cumberland.
Early life.
Cowper was born at Whittington, Lancashire, the son of a yeoman farmer. At 17 years of age Cowper became a tutor in a cleric's family. Later he was a clerk in the royal engineers department at Hull. He was ordained in March 1808 and became a curate in Rawdon near Hull. There he was found by the Reverend Samuel Marsden who induced him to come to Australia.
Australia.
Cowper arrived at Sydney on 18 August 1809 and became assistant chaplain at a salary of £260 a year. He was also incumbent of St Philip's Church (the name was spelt this way in honour of the first governor). He found the state of morality in Sydney deplorable and actively set to work by preaching and, by example, to bring about an improvement. He was one of the founders and secretary of the Benevolent Society of New South Wales and was at one time secretary of six religious and charitable societies. In 1842 Cowper's eyesight began to fail; he obtained leave of absence to go to London to have an operation and was presented with a purse of £780 by his parishioners to cover his expenses. He returned in 1843 with his sight much improved and with a Lambeth degree of Doctor of Divinity which had been conferred on him by the Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1848 Cowper was instrumental in starting the building of the new church of St Philip and gave £500 towards the cost of it. In 1849 he had a dangerous illness but recovered, and in 1852 was appointed to administer the diocese during the absence of Bishop Broughton on a visit to England. The bishop died in February 1853 and Cowper had to continue his duties until Bishop Barker arrived in May 1855.
Late life.
The new church of St Philip was sufficiently complete to be consecrated in March 1856, much to Cowper's joy. He died on 6 July 1858. He was married three times and was survived by four sons and two daughters. Two of his sons, Sir Charles Cowper and William Macquarie Cowper, are noticed separately.
Cowper was devoted to his work. He several times refused to become a magistrate because he considered the duties incompatible with his clerical life.

List of National Wrestling Alliance championships

Active world championships.
Upon its founding in 1948, the NWA Board of Directors recognized only three championships as world titles. There were however no rules within the organization preventing individual members promoting titles in other divisions as world titles. Currently, only four (all but the Welterweight Championship) are currently recognized by the Board.
Unofficial world championships.
NWA promoters from EMLL, later renamed the CMLL, in Mexico began promoting two more championships as World Titles, which were essentially regional titles controlled by EMLL. When the company withdrew from the organization in the 80's, the titles were no longer officially sanctioned by the NWA, however they were still promoted as NWA sanctioned titles by EMLL. In Lucha Libre, titles generally stay with their holder when that competitor leaves a region or company. This practice has caused theses titles, along with the Light Heavyweight Championship, to be accepted as "world titles" in Japan and Mexico. Weight limits for the titles are loosely followed by Lucha Libre promotions.
Defunct world championships.
Prior to 1992, many NWA promoters sanctioned a regional version of a tag team championship as the "World Championship". Although named as world titles, none of the titles were sanctioned as the official world title by the Board of Directors, and were technically regional championships. The Mid-Atlantic version, promoted by Jim Crockett Promotions, became widely accepted as the legitimate World Title when many promotions began folding, or being bought out by JCP. With this consolidation, the Mid-Atlantic version became known as the World Tag Championship, although it was not technically recognized as such by the Board of Directors. It was, however, recognized as such by kayfabe magazine Pro Wrestling Illustrated. As JCP evolved into World Championship Wrestling, this version of the title would become known as the WCW World Tag Team Title.
The following titles were also called "World Championships", but were actually just regional or company titles.
Defunct championships.
While the names of these championships suggest they were defended on a national, or even international, basis, it was rarely the case. The vast majority of the championships listed were rarely, if ever, used outside of the respective NWA territory they belonged to. As a result, most of them were technically regional titles rather than nationally based titles.

Christian d'Oriola

Christian D'Oriola (October 3, 1928 – October 29, 2007) was a noted French foil fencer named "Fencer of the 20th Century" by the FIE, the International Fencing Federation, in 2001.
Born in Perpignan, France, he was World Champion four times (1947, 1949, 1953, and 1954), and twice Olympic Champion (1952, 1956) in the foil individual events. At the 1948 Olympics, at the age of 19, he won a team gold medal and an individual silver medal in foil. At the 1952 Olympics he won gold medals in both the team and individual foil competitions, winning all ten bouts in the team events. In 1956, at the Olympics he again won a gold medal in individual foil, while winning a silver medal in team foil. He was also four time team world champion (1948, 1952, 1953, 1954). Aged 42 he became French champion in the team sabre event in 1970. He is a first cousin of the equestrian Pierre Jonquères d'Oriola. In 1972, he was awarded the French Legion of Honor. 
In 2001, the FIE listed the qualities that made Christian d'Oriola "Fencer of the 20th Century": "The speed of his hand, his prodigious technique, his light but devastatingly quick footwork, his instantaneous reactions, his inventiveness and his ability to adapt perfectly from "academic" (non-electric) to electric foil—all this means that Christian d’Oriola remains a model for his successors past and present."
Noting the aesthetic component of his fencing, the FIE stated: "Christian d’Oriola was fencing perfection personified as no-one else has ever been…"

George Selth Coppin

George Selth Coppin (8 April 1819 – 14 March 1906) was a comic actor, entrepreneur and politician, active in Australia.
Early life.
Coppin was born at Steyning, Sussex, England, son of George Selth Coppin (1794–1854) ( a Norwich surgeon) and Elizabeth Jane, "née" Jackson. His grandfather had been a well-known clergyman at Norwich. George Selth Coppin Senior, studied for the medical profession but abandoned this to go join a group of travelling actors. George Coppin Junior (he rarely used his middle name, Selth) became an assistant in his father's company, George and his sister performed their own act by 1826. At the age of 18 Coppin had an engagement at the Woolwich theatre, and soon afterwards was playing at Richmond, where he became low comedian at a salary of twenty-five shillings a week. He next obtained an engagement at the Queen's Theatre, London, and in subsequent years played as first low comedian in the provinces and at Abbey Street theatre, Dublin, where he had a long acting engagement. There Coppin met Maria Watkins Burroughs, nine years older than Coppin. They lived together from 1842 to 1848.
Australia.
Coppin decided to leave England in search of other opportunities; a coin toss meant he sailed for Australia, not America, towards the end of 1842, arriving in Sydney on 10 March 1843. Coppin negotiated with Joseph Wyatt and had a successful season at the Royal Victoria Theatre. Coppin bought a hotel but, being quite inexperienced, lost his money and went to Hobart, Tasmania in January 1845. At Launceston he formed a company, recruited George Herbert Rogers, and in June 1845 took it to Melbourne and opened at the Queen's Theatre, recently built by John Thomas Smith. In August 1846 Coppin went to Adelaide, converted a billiard room into the New Queen's Theatre with a 700-seat capacity, and on 2 November 1846 began his season with "The King and the Comedian", Coppin playing the part of Stolbach (the comedian). Coppin subsequently played a variety of parts including Sir Peter Teazle, Jacques Strop in "Robert Macaire", Jemmy Twitcher in "The Golden Farmer", Don Caesar in "Don Caesar de Bazan" and many others in forgotten plays. In 1848 Coppin transferred the management of the theatre to John Lazar. Coppin suffered losses in copper-mining and with the exodus to the Victorian gold rush, he became insolvent. Coppin left Adelaide and returned to Victoria in December 1851. Coppin tried his fortunes briefly as a gold-digger without success, began playing at Geelong, then returned to Adelaide in 1853 to pay his creditors 20 shillings in the pound. Still in 1853, Coppin visited England where he acted in the provinces. There he met Gustavus Vaughan Brooke, engaged a company, and returned to Australia bringing with them an iron theatre in sections which was erected in Melbourne as the Princess Theatre. Brooke was to establish a great reputation in Australia. In July 1855 Coppin was playing Colonel Damas with him in "The Lady of Lyons", and about this time they became partners. They bought the Theatre Royal and the Cremorne Gardens and spent £60,000 on them. In 1859 Coppin imported six camels from Aden as exhibits for the Cremorne Gardens menagerie and in 1860 he sold them for £300 to the Exploration Committee of the Royal Society of Victoria who used them on the Burke and Wills expedition.
The partnership of Brooks and Coppin was dissolved in 1859 and Coppin, having become security for a large sum in connection with the Melbourne and Suburban railway, was in financial difficulties again. The line was sold and he became freed from his liability. In 1862 he built the Haymarket Theatre on the south side of Bourke Street, and in 1863 Mr and Mrs Charles Kean played a season there. 
Coppin initially made his reputation as an actor but, after he had been a few years in Australia, management took up increasing amounts of his time. He was a comedian, who starred in parts like Paul Pry, Bob Acres, and Lancelot Gobbo. He also played Aminadab Sleek in "The Serious Family", Mawworm in "The Hypocrite" and Tony Lumpkin. James Smith, a critic of his time, spoke of his success in presenting "the ponderous stolidity and impenetrable stupidity of certain types of humanity—the voice, the gait, the movements, the expression of the actor's features, were all in perfect harmony with the mental and moral idiosyncrasies of the person he represented, so that the man himself stood before you a living reality". 
In 1864 Coppin again lost his money and went to the United States. At a farewell dinner he was presented with a cheque for £300 and was given a public reception when he returned in 1866. He joined Messrs. Harwood, Stewart and Hennings in the management of the Theatre Royal, and, although they lost heavily at times, Coppin's record from this point is one of increasing prosperity.
Political career.
In April 1858 Coppin began to take an interest in public affairs — he became a councillor in the Richmond municipality, and in October 1858 was elected for the South Western Province in the Victorian Legislative Council for a term of five years. In 1859 he brought in a transfer of property bill which was passed in the Council and rejected in the Assembly. Three years later it became law, James Service taking charge of it in the assembly, and Coppin in the council. This measure, often referred to as the "Torrens Act", has proved to be a very valuable one. Coppin resigned from the Council in February 1863.
Coppin was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for East Melbourne in May 1874 and did useful work; for example, he established post office savings banks. Coppin was opposed to the payment of members of Parliament, and when the act passed to pay them, he gave his salary to charities. Coppin retired from theatrical management on 28 June 1882, but remained a member of the Legislative Assembly until losing his seat in March 1889. Soon after, in August 1889, he was elected as member for Melbourne Province in the Victorian Legislative Council, holding this seat until August 1895.
Later life.
Coppin took an interest in the development of Sorrento, Victoria where he had a seaside home, and kept up his connection with the Old Colonists' Association (which he had founded), the Humane Society, Gordon House and other institutions. When managing the Cremorne Gardens he had brought out the first balloon to ascend in Melbourne, and was responsible for the acclimatization of English thrushes and white swans. He was also the first to suggest the value of camels for the Australian interior. He died early in the morning of 14 March 1906, aged 86. He was married twice, firstly in August 1855 to Harriet Hilsden "née" Bray (Gustavus Brooke's sister-in-law, died 2 September 1859), and then on 4 June 1861 to her daughter Lucy Hilsden, who survived him with their two sons and five daughters. Two of the three daughters of his first marriage also survived Coppin. 
A bronze plaque to Coppin's memory was unveiled at the Comedy Theatre, Melbourne, on 26 March 1939. He is there described as "Philanthropist and Father of the Theatre in Victoria".
A well-received biography "Coppin the Great : father of the Australian theatre", written by E. D. A. Bagot was published by Melbourne University Press in 1965.

Abraham Rhinewine

Abraham Rhinewine (1887-1932) was a Polish-born, Canadian-Jewish editor, publisher and author, among the most prominent Jewish journalists in Canada during his time. He was raised as an orthodox Jew in Mezhirech (Miedzyrzec), Poland and trained to be a rabbi, but at the age of 15, he became a socialist and, apparently after attempting to unionize his father's factory, was sent to England to continue his secular education. He later settled in North America, where he was to work briefly and unsuccessfully in the millinery industry in New York City. He then settled in Toronto where he began his brief but highly distinguished career as a journalist and scholar. He is the author of several books in Yiddish as well as English, as well as many journalistic articles in these languages, and was publisher and editor-in-chief of the Hebrew Journal (Der Yidisher Zshurnal), a key Jewish newspaper in Toronto. Although he did not possess an advanced degree apart from a rabbinical certification from Poland and coursework from McMaster University (at that time in Toronto), he taught courses in Judaism at the University of Toronto and was well regarded as a secular scholar. He was politically active as a Jew and passionately advocated the Zionist cause for a Jewish state in Palestine. Following an unfortunate ouster from his position at the newspaper, he died May 19, 1932, at age 44, of complications from diabetes.

Rock Me Baby (song)

"Rock Me Baby" is a blues standard that has become one of the most recorded blues songs of all time. When B.B. King's recording of "Rock Me Baby" was released in 1964, it became his first Top 40 hit. It is based on earlier blues songs and has been interpreted and recorded by numerous artists in a variety of styles; Allmusic shows over 2,000 entries for "Rock Me Baby".
Earlier songs.
B.B. King's "Rock Me Baby" is based on "Rockin' and Rollin'", a song recorded by Lil' Son Jackson in 1950 (Imperial 5113). King's lyrics are nearly identical to Jackson's, although instrumentally the songs are different. "Rockin' and Rollin'" is a solo piece, with Jackson's vocal and guitar accompaniment, whereas "Rock Me Baby" is an ensemble piece.
Muddy Waters' song "Rock Me", recorded in 1956 (Chess 1652), is also based on Jackson's song. Some of Jackson's lyrics were used, but Waters incorporated a couple of verses from his 1951 song "All Night Long" (which is also based on "Rockin' and Rollin'") (Chess 1509). Muddy Waters' "Rock Me" also uses Jackson's guitar figure and the starting of the vocal on the IV chord and he interpreted it as an unusual fifteen-bar blues (an uneven number of measures, rather than the traditional twelve bars or somewhat less common eight or sixteen bars). Muddy Waters recorded a second version of "Rock Me" for his 1978 album "I'm Ready". 
Lil' Son Jackson's "Rockin' and Rollin'" was inspired by earlier blues songs. Many songs from the 1920s through the 1940s have some combination of "rock", "roll", "baby", and "mama" in the title or lyrics, although instrumentally they are different than "Rock Me Baby", "Rock Me", or "Rockin' and Rollin'". Big Bill Broonzy's 1940 song "Rockin' Chair Blues" makes frequent use of the phrase "rock me baby" as in "Rock me baby now, rock me slow ... now rock me baby, one time before you go" (OKeh 6116). Arthur Crudup's 1944 song, "Rock Me Mama", is based on Broonzy's song and repeats the same refrain, but uses "mama" in place of "baby" (Bluebird 34-0725). Curtis Jones' 1939 song "Roll Me Mama" shares a couple of phrases ("like a wagon wheel", "ain't got no bone") with "Rockin' and Rollin'" (Vocalion 4693).
B.B. King song.
"Rock Me Baby" is a medium-tempo twelve-bar blues notated in the key of C in common or 4/4 time. In addition to King's vocal and guitar, the song features a "tight, punchy arrangement underpinned by a pianist whose identity is in some doubt". Kent part-owner Joe Bihari recalled the pianist as King's frequent collaborator Maxwell Davis, although others have been suggested, such as Lloyd Glenn and Jimmy McCracklin. The arrangement "provides a blues structure that allows King room for biting guitar work" and appealed to many guitarists.
There is some confusion as to when B.B. King recorded "Rock Me Baby". Although King had signed to ABC-Paramount Records in January 14, 1962, his former label, Kent Records, continued to release singles (and albums) well into the 1970s from "many unreleased King masters ... thus forcing King to compete with himself". Recording dates have been estimated as "about 1958" to before 1962. The song was released shortly after King's Paramount release "How Blue Can You Get" in 1964 and reached #34 in the Billboard Hot 100. "Rock Me Baby" was the first of six B.B. King records to reach the pop Top 40. In 1997, King re-recorded the song with Eric Clapton for the album "Deuces Wild".
Other versions.
Over the years, many blues and other artists have interpreted and recorded "Rock Me Baby". Although "most contemporary versions are based on Lil' Son Jackson's 1951 record, 'Rockin' and Rollin'", "B.B. King and Muddy Waters can share credit for making it one of the most familiar blues songs of all time."
Some studio versions include Otis Redding from "" (1965), The Animals from "Animalism" (1966), Jeff Beck as "Rock My Plimsoul" from the "Truth" album with slightly altered lyrics (1968), Blue Cheer from "Vincebus Eruptum" (1968), Lightnin' Hopkins from "Lightnin’, Vol. 1" (1969), Robin Trower from "Twice Removed from Yesterday" (1973), Johnny Winter from "Still Alive and Well" (1973), Frank Marino & Mahogany Rush from "What's Next" (1980), Hot Tuna from "Historic Hot Tuna" (1985), Tina Turner from "What's Love Got to Do With It" (1993), and Steve Miller Band from "Bingo!" (2010).
Live versions include those by Jimi Hendrix from "Historic Performances Recorded at the Monterey International Pop Festival" (1967, released 1970), Jefferson Airplane from "Bless Its Pointed Little Head" (1968), The Doors from "Live in Detroit" as part of medley with "Heartbreak Hotel" (1970), Deep Purple from "Made in Europe" as part of medley with "Mistreated" (1976), Eddy Clearwater from "Black Night" (1979) and The Rolling Stones from "Live Licks" (2003).

John Clarkson (abolitionist)

Lieutenant John Clarkson, RN (1764–1828) was the younger brother of Thomas Clarkson, one of the central figures in the abolition of slavery in England and the British Empire at the close of the 18th century. As agent for the Sierra Leone Company, Lieutenant Clarkson was instrumental in the founding of Freetown, today Sierra Leone’s capital city, as a haven for chiefly former American slaves first relocated to Nova Scotia by the British military authorities following the American Revolutionary War. John Clarkson not only founded Freetown, but was also the first governor of the settlement. Because of his work in establishing Freetown, John Clarkson is considered to be one of the founding fathers of Sierra Leone, alongside Granville Sharp, Thomas Peters, and Henry Thornton. To this day, the last prayer by John Clarkson at Freetown can be found in the houses of Creoles and other Sierra Leoneans alike. To the Nova Scotians, 'Governor Clarkson' was both 'Father' and their 'Moses' who delivered them into the promised land.
Early Life and Career in the Navy.
Clarkson was the second son of Rev. John Clarkson, headmaster of Wisbech Grammar School in Cambridgeshire. He was born in the Headmaster's house and, despite the early death of his father, continued to attend the school until 1777 when, aged 12, he entered the Royal Navy as a "young gentleman" on Captain Joshua Rowley's ship, . He was commissioned as a lieutenant in 1783. He served primarily in the Caribbean and observed at first hand the brutality and inhumanity of the slave trade. Initially unmoved by what he had witnessed he later, likely influenced by his brother Thomas’ passionate views concerning the immorality of slavery, came to abhor the institution and rendered practical assistance to the cause of abolition.
Mission to America.
His brother Thomas, along with William Wilberforce and other members of the Committee for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade, had incorporated the Sierra Leone Company with a view to resettling certain free and formerly enslaved blacks on the west coast of Africa. Lieutenant Clarkson’s charge was to secure among black communities of Nova Scotia, Canada, volunteers to settle in the area of the mouth of the Sierra Leone River.
The blacks in Nova Scotia were chiefly former African-American slaves relocated there after the Revolutionary War known as Black Loyalists. They had escaped to the British and fought with them to secure their own freedom. The British promised resettlement, land and provisions for the first year. Despite promises from the military, the settlements were underfunded, and authorities tended to favor white Loyalists, especially those from the South who had brought slaves with them to Nova Scotia, complicating the social situation. They competed with the freedmen for land and power.
After arriving in Nova Scotia from England in October 1791, Clarkson worked with the Black Loyalist leader Thomas Peters and gathered a group of close to 1,200 African Nova Scotians who wanted to leave for better opportunities in Sierra Leone. Some wanted to return home, having been kidnapped and enslaved from Africa as children. They departed in fifteen ships for Africa late in the year, meeting terrible conditions at sea. After a harrowing transatlantic passage in winter, the flotilla of 15 ships arrived in Sierra Leone in March 1792. The Africans from Nova Scotia, who became known as the Nova Scotian Settlers, established Freetown. Clarkson remained at the settlement until returning to England at the end of December of 1792. He served as Governor from August 1792 until his departure.
The founding of Freetown and Governor of Sierra Leone.
The records of the settlers confirm Clarkson as a conscientious, supportive, reasonable and fair administrator. Clarkson was universally respected by the Settlers and even among the Creole people, Governor Clarkson is remembered as a fair administrator. Clarkson was one of the most popular governors of Sierra Leone and was universally respected by the Nova Scotians. From his work with the settlers in Nova Scotia and Sierra Leone, he grew to have great respect for them and struggled to ensure the company representatives did not take advantage of them. His advocacy for the settlers upon his return to England and recrimination of the Company’s actions, or lack thereof, resulted in his final dismissal by the Company. Clarkson had submitted objections to the Company's actions which were inconsistent with the representations and assurances he had made to the settlers. Clarkson never returned to Freetown but he received settlers who traveled to England to fight for their rights in the colony. They succeeded in carving out a political community and rights for themselves even with governors who were much less flexible than Clarkson.
Death and legacy.
Clarkson died on 2 April 1828 in Woodbridge, Suffolk. He was buried in the churchyard of St. Mary's church. The unassuming Clarkson’s last words in reaction to a report of the unrelenting abuse of slaves in the West Indies were reported to be, "It is dreadful to think, after my brother and his friends have been working for forty years that such things should still be."
Clarkson was portrayed by Stephen Campbell Moore in the BBC television Rough Crossings (2007).

<doc id="9639766" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9639766" title="The Michaels">
The Michaels

The Michaels is a public name used to refer to the couple Michael Stark and Michael Leshner. They were the men who in 2003 entered into the first legal same-sex marriage in Canada, and were consequently named the Canadian Newsmakers of the Year by "Time" magazine.
Background.
Leshner is a lawyer and a Jew, while Stark is a Catholic and a manager involved in graphic design. Leshner was born on April 8, 1948, in Niagara Falls, New York. He then lived in St. Catharines, Ontario and went to Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School. Feeling isolated in small-town Ontario as a homosexual, he went for post-secondary education to the University of Toronto.
In 1992, Leshner, who worked for the Ontario government, made news when he successfully argued before a court that the provincial government should allow survivor pensions for gay people. He then told the media he believed that private companies should also allow such pensions for homosexuals, or they could be subject to the Ontario Human Rights Commission. Leshner also said, "I'm rather hard on the gay and lesbian community in part because I think there's too much emphasis on why you should feel sorry for yourself. Social change will happen as quickly as you're willing to move it. If it doesn't happen, don't blame Minister Brian Mulroney."
Marriage.
When Leshner heard of colleagues' plans to try to legalize same-sex civil marriage, he persuaded Stark to get married so the two could start the case. Leshner considered himself to have been in a common law marriage with Stark for 22 years. After the ruling by a lower Ontario court, Leshner proposed to Stark in front of reporters. The marriage then occurred after the decision "Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General)" by the Court of Appeal for Ontario deciding homosexuals should be allowed to marry. The Michaels afterwards became well known in their city Toronto, and appeared in the 2003 gay pride parade. The two even made international news. Paul Boddum, a Canadian artist profiled in the "National Post" for his work based on dogs, made a portrait called "Schmikey the Schnauzer" for Leshner and Stark as a wedding present. The "National Post" said this was "Boddum's most famous commission to date."
"Time" selected the couple as Newsmakers of the Year as an emblem of "the year that Canada rethought what was taboo," referring to other events such as the loosening of marijuana laws. Leshner replied that "I really feel like we're Canada's new Mary Pickford... we are Canada's sweethearts... What better human rights story to send around the world that says Canada loves the Michaels, and for the rest of the world to wonder, what on earth is going on in Canada?" However, some Canadians have been critical of Leshner and Stark, and wrote to newspapers calling them a "sick aberration," while other Canadians did defend them. One paper called this an "apt reflection of public opinion polls" indicating Canadians were divided on whether same-sex marriage should be allowed.
"The Globe and Mail", in choosing the "Nation Builders of the year," did not select Leshner and Stark. However, they did select the judges involved in the case, namely Chief Justice Roy McMurtry, Eileen Gillese and James MacPherson.
Afterwards.
In 2003, Bishop Jean-Louis Plouffe argued that future-Prime Minister Paul Martin would not be truly Catholic if his government recognized same-sex marriage. At around the same time, Bishop Fred Henry said then-Prime Minister Jean Chrétien may go to hell for recognizing such marriages. Leshner responded to these arguments, which he called "religious intolerance," by saying "I think the bishop has eaten too much mad cow... The Charter of Rights trumps the Bible." In 2004, Leshner wrote a column in the "Toronto Star" speaking out against Conservative leader Stephen Harper in the 2004 federal election. Leshner expressed fear that Harper would use the notwithstanding clause to overrule gay rights in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Leshner said that "I am beginning to feel like a Jew in Germany in the early 1930s."
Also in 2004, the Supreme Court of Canada listed Leshner and Stark among the intervenors in the case "Re Same-Sex Marriage", which found that the federal government could establish same-sex marriage. Following the decision, the press noted Leshner and Stark took part in celebrations. Leshner publicly commented in reference to Alberta Premier Ralph Klein, who Leshner perceived as having been defeated by the ruling, "Ralph, I'm 56-years-old and I can now say: 'Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-na-na.'"

<doc id="9639784" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9639784" title="Equal justice under law">
Equal justice under law

Equal justice under law is a phrase engraved on the front of the United States Supreme Court building in Washington D.C. It is also a societal ideal that has influenced the American legal system.
The phrase was proposed by the building's architects, and then approved by judges of the Court in 1932. It is based upon Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence, and has historical antecedents dating back to ancient Greece.
Proposed by architects and approved by judges.
The architectural firm that proposed the phrase was headed by Cass Gilbert, though Gilbert himself was much more interested in design and arrangement, than in meaning. Thus, according to David Lynn who at that time held the position of Architect of the Capitol, the two people at Gilbert's firm who were responsible for the slogan "equal justice under law" were Gilbert's son (Cass Gilbert, Jr.) and Gilbert's partner, John R. Rockart.
In 1935, the journalist Herbert Bayard Swope objected to Chief Justice Hughes about this inscription, urging that the word "equal" be removed because such a "qualification" renders the phrase too narrow; the equality principle would still be implied without that word, Swope said. Hughes refused, writing that it was appropriate to "place a strong emphasis upon impartiality".
This legal soundbite atop the Court is perceived differently by different people, sometimes as ostentatious, often as profound, and occasionally as vacuous. According to law professor Jim Chen, it is common for people to "suggest that disagreement with some contestable legal proposition or another would be tantamount to chiseling or sandblasting 'Equal Justice Under Law' from the Supreme Court's portico." The phrase may be perceived in a variety of ways, but it very distinctly does not say "equal law under justice", which would have meant that the judiciary can prioritize justice over law.
Based upon Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence.
The words "equal justice under law" paraphrase an earlier expression coined in 1891 by the Supreme Court. In the case of "Caldwell v. Texas", Chief Justice Melville Fuller wrote on behalf of a unanimous Court as follows, regarding the Fourteenth Amendment: "the powers of the States in dealing with crime within their borders are not limited, but no State can deprive particular persons or classes of persons of equal and impartial justice under the law." The last seven words have been shortened to fit on the U.S. Supreme Court building.
In both "Caldwell" and "Leeper", murder indictments were challenged because they allegedly gave inadequate notice of the crimes being charged. The Court upheld the indictments because they followed the form required by Texas law. In a case nine years later ("Maxwell v. Dow"), the Court quoted the "equal...justice under...law" phrase that it had used in "Caldwell" and "Leeper", to make the point that Utah could devise its own criminal procedure, as long as defendants are "proceeded against by the same kind of procedure and ... have the same kind of trial, and the equal protection of the laws is secured to them."
In the 1908 case of "Ughbanks v. Armstrong", the Fuller Court yet again discussed the Fourteenth Amendment in similar terms, but this time mentioning punishments: "The last-named Amendment was not intended to, and does not, limit the powers of a State in dealing with crime committed within its own borders or with the punishment thereof, although no State can deprive particular persons or classes of persons of equal and impartial justice under the law." 
"Ughbanks" was a burglary case, and the opinion was written for the Court by Justice Rufus Peckham, while Justice John Marshall Harlan was the sole dissenter. The Court would later reject the idea that the Fourteenth Amendment does not limit punishments (see the 1962 case of "Robinson v. California"). 
In the years since moving into their present building, the Supreme Court has often connected the words "equal justice under law" with the Fourteenth Amendment. For example, in the 1958 case of "Cooper v. Aaron", the Court said: "The Constitution created a government dedicated to equal justice under law. The Fourteenth Amendment embodied and emphasized that ideal." 
The words "equal justice under law" are not in the Constitution, which instead says that no state shall "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." From an architectural perspective, the main advantage of the former over the latter was brevity — the Equal Protection Clause was not short enough to fit on the pediment given the size of the letters to be used.
Following ancient tradition.
Here is Pericles discussing "equal justice" according to the English translation by Richard Crawley in 1874:
Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighbouring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration favours the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition.
The English translation by Benjamin Jowett in 1881 likewise had Pericles saying: "the law secures equal justice to all alike in their private disputes". And, the English translation by Rex Warner in 1954 had Pericles saying: "there exists equal justice to all and alike in their private disputes". The funeral oration by Pericles was published in Thucydides’ "History of the Peloponnesian War", of which there are several other English translations. 
As quoted above, Pericles said that a person's wealth or prominence should not influence his eligibility for public employment or affect the justice he receives. Similarly, Chief Justice Hughes defended the inscription "equal justice under law" by referring to the judicial oath of office, which requires judges to "administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich". Decades later, Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall made a similar point: "The principles which would have governed with $10,000 at stake should also govern when thousands have become billions. That is the essence of equal justice under law."

Sinus (anatomy)

Sinus is a sac or cavity in any organ or tissue, or an abnormal cavity or passage caused by the destruction of tissue. In common usage, "sinus" usually refers to the paranasal sinuses, which are air cavities in the cranial bones, especially those near the nose and connecting to it. Each individual has four paired cavities located in the cranial bone or skull. These cavities are vital for a number of reasons.
Etymology.
"Sinus" is Latin for "bay", "pocket", "curve", or "bosom". In anatomy, the term is used in various contexts.
The word "sinusitis" is used to indicate that one or more of the membrane linings found in the sinus cavities has become inflamed or infected. It is however distinct from a fistula, which is a tract connecting two epithelial surfaces. If left untreated, infections occurring in the sinus cavities can affect the chest and lungs.
Paranasal sinuses.
The four paired sinuses or air cavities can be referred to as:
Function.
The presence of sinus cavities within the cranial bone (skull) is essential for the following reasons:
Sinusitis.
If one or more of the paired paranasal sinuses or air cavities becomes inflamed, it leads to an infection called sinusitis. The term "sinusitis" means an inflammation of one or more of the sinus cavities. This inflammation causes an increase in internal pressure within these areas. The pressure is often experienced in the cheek area, eyes, nose, on one side of the head (temple areas), and can result in a severe headache.
When diagnosing a sinus infection, one can identify which sinus cavity the infection is located in by the term given to the cavity. Ethmoiditis refers to an infection in the ethmoid sinus cavity/ies, frontal sinusitis refers to an infection occurring in the frontal sinus cavity/ies, antritis is used to refer to an infection in the maxillary sinus cavity/ies whilst spenoiditis refers to an infection in the sphenoid sinus cavity/ies.
Classification.
Sinusitis can be acute, chronic or recurrent. 
Causes.
A sinus infection can have a number of causes. Untreated allergies are one of the main contributing factors to the development of sinus infections. A person with a sinus infection often has nasal congestion with thick nasal secretions, fever, and cough (WebMD). Patients can be treated by “reducing the swelling or inflammation in the nasal passages and sinuses, eliminating the infection, promoting drainage from the sinuses, and maintaining open sinuses” (WebMD). Sinusitis can be treated with medications and can also be eliminated by surgery.
Another cause of sinus infections is a result of bacterial invasion within one or more of the sinus cavities. Any bacteria that enter the nasal passages and sinus cavities through the air that is inhaled, are trapped by the mucus secreted by the mucous membranes surrounding these areas. These trapped particles can cause an irritation to these linings resulting in swelling and inflammation. “Bacteria that normally cause acute sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (WebMD). These microorganisms, along with Staphylococcus aureus and some anaerobes (bacteria that live without oxygen), are involved in chronic sinusitis (WebMD).” Fungi can also cause chronic sinusitis.
Certain abnormalities or trauma related injuries to the nasal cavity can make it difficult for effective drainage of mucus from the sinus cavities. This mucus is then allowed to develop in these areas making the cavity an ideal area in which bacteria can both attach and thrive.
Treatment outlook.
Sinusitis or sinus infections usually clear up if treated early and appropriately. Apart from complications, the outlook for acute bacterial sinusitis is good. People may develop chronic sinusitis or have recurrent attacks of acute sinusitis if they suffer with allergies or if they have any “structural or anatomical causes" which predispose them to developing sinus infections.
Viral sinus infections do not however respond well to conventional treatments such as antibiotics. When treating fungal sinusitis, an appropriate fungicide is usually administered.

United States Court of Private Land Claims

The United States Court of Private Land Claims (1891–1904), was a United States court created to decide land claims guaranteed by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, in the territories of New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah, and in the states of Nevada, Colorado, and Wyoming.
Origins.
During Spanish (1598–1821) and Mexican (1821–1846) rule over what was to become the U.S. Southwest, the governments made land grants to various individuals and communities. Under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848), which ended the Mexican-American War, the United States obtained these territories, and in Article VIII guaranteed the rights of Mexican and former Mexican citizens to their property. However, the U.S. Senate in ratifying the treaty eliminated Article 10, which stated that the U.S. government would honor and guarantee all land grants awarded in lands ceded to the United States to citizens of Spain and Mexico by those respective governments. Thus land grants were subject to being proved.
In 1851, Congress passed the first legislation implementing the property protection provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, however it addressed only the Spanish and Mexican grants in California. Congress focused on California’s land grants first because California was already a populous state, and it wanted to encourage further settlement of the public domain land there.
In 1854 the U.S. Congress established the office of the Surveyor General of New Mexico to ascertain "the origin, nature, character, and extent to all claims to lands under the laws, usages, and customs of Spain and Mexico." At first the Congress tried to deal with each land grant by special bill and the House had a Committee on Private Land Claims, seats on which were sought after as a way of dispensing patronage. By 1880 the corruption inherent in determining these claims by politics rather than on a legal basis forced an end to this practice. For ten years no claims could be proved as against the United States.
So the U.S. Congress, in 1891, created the Court of Private Land Claims consisting of five justices appointed for a term to expire on December 31, 1895. The court itself was to exist only during this period, although its existence and the terms of the justices were from time to time extended until June 30, 1904. This court was given jurisdiction over claims to land in the territories of New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah, and in the states of Nevada, Colorado, and Wyoming, which had not been previously proved and affirmed by the United States. Many of these Spanish or Mexican land grants were based upon incomplete documentation, in part because those governments did not issue deeds to the grantees, and records were kept variously at the territorial, state, vice-royal or imperial level.
Work of the Court.
The court heard over three hundred cases involving over thirty-six million acres (150,000 km²) of land. Only eighty-seven land grants were confirmed, for a total of three million acres (12,000 km²), or less than 10%. Many confirmed grants were reduced in size from that claimed. For example, the Cañon de Chama Grant was reduced from 200,000 to 1,500 acres (800 to 6 km²).
Among the many problems facing the court were the old Spanish system of metes and bounds. Century or two old landmarks were hard to find. The length of a "vara" (Spanish yard) might vary depending on the date of the grant. A grant might be to the "faldas" (Spanish skirt) of the mountains, which could be anywhere from the edge of the foothills to timberline.

Civil societarianism

Civil societarianism is the belief that intermediary organizations and associations between the individual and the society have greater moral importance than the state. This differs from communitarianism in that it does not value such intermediary associations more than the individual. The term was coined by Arnold Kling, a George Mason University economics professor, to clear some ground between Randian libertarians and those libertarians that do not base their philosophy on selfishness. 
In his article, Kling writes: 
He also offers the concept as an alternative to ideas that Liberals should withdraw, or try to escape, from state-dominated societies.
Jean-Jacques Rousseau's theory of the General Will serves as a good contrast to the civil societarian view, one in which all social groups should be ended apart from the state, so that they do not cause division and disunity. (See Robert Nisbet and his "Quest For Community".)

<doc id="9639934" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9639934" title="Spurrier's Tavern">
Spurrier's Tavern

Spurrier's Tavern was a tavern and horse-changing depot which stood by the main road between Baltimore and Washington, D.C. (now U.S. Route 1) from 1771 to 1835. During the American Revolutionary War, the tavern was significant as a supply and resting point for the Continental Army; George Washington was a frequent visitor. Thomas Twining, a British passenger on a stage coach trip from Baltimore to Georgetown in April 1796, described Spurrier's as a "solitary inn" at which they "found the usual substantial American breakfast".
1800s.
John Spurrier's estate was sold in June 1811 to Rosalie Calvert. After 1812, the Inn was renamed Waterloo by an anti-Napoleon innkeeper; the tavern served stagecoaches bound for Washington, D.C., during the early 19th century. On December 7, 1812, the state authorized a company to run the Baltimore-Washington road in front of Spurrier's as a turnpike. John Pendleton Kennedy, a young militiaman during the War of 1812, wrote of his Fifth Regiment's stopping in 1814 "at Waterloo, then McCoy's Tavern" for dinner, ultimately on their way to Bladensburg. In 1815, brick stables were built following a hurricane. Following nearly twenty years without a title, the property was recorded in 1832 to George Calvert of Anne Arundel County "(Liber W.S.G 17 folio 193-195)". The tavern burned down in 1835 at a time when Irish and German B&O work teams were fighting and burning each other's camps nearby.
In 1836, George Calvert's estate was divided three ways, giving his daughter Caroline the Spurrier property. Caroline's husband protested that the property was not equally valuable since the fire at the tavern. In 1841, as a supplement to the act that passed nearly thirty years prior, the State of Maryland recognized the Waterloo property along the Baltimore Washington Turnpike road as belonging to Caroline M Morris, for purposes of coordinating any route alterations. Morris owned what was then known as Waterloo farm; the prior act referred to the property as McCoy's Tavern. Morris ( Calvert, 1800–1842) had married Thomas Willing Morris (1792–1852) on June 19, 1823.
1900s.
In 1917, the state of Maryland bought parts of two former farms adjoining the Baltimore and Washington boulevard at Waterloo, totaling 530 acres, for the use of the Maryland House of Correction. Referred to as Shamrock farm and Waterloo farm, both were described favorably by the Maryland State College of Agriculture (renamed a few years later as the University of Maryland). According to a 1980 inventory of the Maryland House of Correction by the Maryland Historical Trust, "farming was discontinued during the 1960s and lands were sold off to the Maryland State Police, the Patuxent Institution, the Correctional Institution for Women and the Correctional Camp Center, and the Maryland Wholesale Produce Market complex on the southeast corner of Route 1 and Route 175."
Present.
The former location of Spurrier's Tavern is now the major intersection of U.S. 1 and Maryland Route 175 in Jessup, Maryland. A Holiday Inn now occupies the site, which bears Maryland historical markers.
Historical markers.
At least three historical markers have been posted along the two roads that intersect near the site. The text of the markers has changed slightly over the years, adding some detail and removing notice of its being the place where Washington's horse died. Washington mentioned Spurrier's several times in his diary entries.

Pope Alexander Cooper

Sir Pope Alexander Cooper KCMG (12 May 184830 August 1923) was an attorney-general and a chief judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland, Australia.
Early life.
Pope Alexander Cooper was born at Willeroo Station, Lake George, New South Wales, the son of Francis Cooper, a squatter, and his wife Sarah, née Jenkins. Cooper was educated at the Sydney Grammar School and the University of Sydney, where he won the Cooper and Gilchrist scholarships and graduated with a B.A. and in 1868 a M.A.. He then went to London where he completed the LL.B. course, became a student of the Middle Temple, and was called to the English bar in June 1872.
Career.
Cooper returned to Australia and began to practise as a barrister at Brisbane in June 1874. He became a crown prosecutor and in January 1879 and entered the Legislative Assembly of Queensland as member for Bowen. On 31 December 1880 he joined the first Thomas McIlwraith ministry as attorney-general. He resigned this position on 6 January 1883 when he was appointed as a 
supreme court judge for the northern district of Queensland. His travelling expenses caused some quarrels. In 1895 he became senior puisne judge at Brisbane, and on 21 October 1903 chief justice. He resigned this position 31 March 1922, being succeeded by Thomas McCawley, and died on 30 August 1923.
Legacy.
In 1873, Cooper married Alice Frener, daughter of James Cooper who died in 1900 leaving a son and two daughters. He was knighted 1904 and was created a KCMG in 1908. He was chancellor of the University of Queensland from 1915 to 1922. 
Cooper had only a short career in parliament but made himself a reputation as a polished speaker. As a judge he was always seeking the essentials of a case and generally adopted a common attitude on legal questions. His summings up were usually brief and to the point. In criminal cases he could be severe though just. In his conduct of the court, though always courteous, he insisted that the dignity of the bench must be upheld, and he was quick to restrain anything in the nature of contempt of court. He was an efficient lieutenant-governor.

From Guelph, Ontario, Carroll worked with the Toronto Blueshirts of the National Hockey Association. He won the Stanley Cup with his brother Frank as a trainer in 1914. In December, 1917 Dick was then hired by Charlie Querrie to be assistant manager and coach of the new Toronto NHL franchise. The team won the Stanley Cup in its first year, but even with largely the same lineup, struggled badly in 1918–19 (now under the name the Toronto Arenas), finishing with five wins and 13 losses. Carroll was replaced as coach after that season.
In 1919–20, Carroll coached the Toronto Dental Society senior team in the Ontario Hockey Association and the Toronto Canoe Club junior team that won the 1920 Memorial Cup. In 1920–21 and 1921–22, he coached the Toronto Aura Lee senior team.

The Queen's School, Chester

The Queen's School is an independent day school for girls aged 4–18 located in Chester, England. Founded in 1878 as "The Chester School for Girls", Queen Victoria, who was the school's first patron, issued a royal decree naming the school as "The Queen's School" in 1882, the only school in England to have this distinction. It is a member of the Girls' Schools Association.
It was one of only three independent schools in Cheshire to be named in The Sunday Times' top 100 schools for 2011.
History.
Founded in 1878 by a group of prominent Chester citizens as The Chester School for Girls, the school owes its royal name to Queen Victoria. In response to a request from the Duke of Westminster, an early benefactor of the school, in 1882 she graciously commanded “that the School in question shall be styled the Queen’s School”.
The school originally had its home at 100 Watergate Flags, a handsome 18th century house built upon the site of an extramural Roman bathhouse. However, as pupil numbers grew swiftly, it soon became evident that the school needed larger premises and by 1881 it was decided to look for a suitable alternative.
Once again, the Duke of Westminster supported the school by offering the trustees a piece of land which had once been the site of Chester’s city gaol and house of correction, together with a gift of £500 towards the building of a new school. This site, right on the city walls of historic Chester and within walking distance of the city’s centre, still exists today as the home of the school’s senior pupils. More recently, further buildings have been constructed or acquired, so that the school inhabits a mixture of elegant Georgian and Victorian buildings as well as modern ones.
The Queen’s Lower School was originally based in two large Victorian houses set in spacious grounds at Liverpool Road. Today, it also includes a purpose-built hall, library and science facilities, together with a state-of-the-art computer suite, which is used from pupils from age 4 upwards.
Curriculum.
The 2011 ISI inspection rated the curriculum as "excellent" and noted its excellent GCSE and A Levels results. Girls are taught a range of subjects including languages, Mathematics, the Sciences, Technology, the Humanities, PE and the creative arts. All pupils in Year 7 are required to learn Spanish and Mandarin and may choose a language of their choice from the two or French and German the following year.
The Queen's School has regularly performed well in exams and consistently ranks as one of the region's top independent schools. It has performed particularly well in the arts and sciences. For the seventh year in a row the girls achieved more than 92% of their results at A*-B standard, well in excess of the national average, in the 2011 GCSEs.
The record-breaking 2012 A Level results were the highest achieved in Cheshire and placed The Queen's School in the top 20 nationally. The combination of A Level and GCSE results for 2012 were recognised as being the highest across Chester, Wirral and North Wales. 
The Queen's School is the only independent school in the north of England to be recognised and designated "Advanced Confucius Classroom" status by Hanban for excellence in teaching Mandarin Chinese.
Girls are encouraged to participate in non-academic pursuits through programmes such as the Duke of Edinburgh Award, Young Enterprise, musical groups and other clubs and societies.
Extra-curricular.
A wide range of extra-curricular activities are offered at both the Lower and Senior School. Girls are encouraged to take on a limitless approach to learning, to excel at things they enjoy and have talents in and to explore new talents and challenge themselves. Teachers are encouraged to go beyond the syllabus, exploring wider issues to nurture talent wherever it lay.
Lower School activities and clubs include Fencing, Book Club, Glee Club, Ocarina, Dance, Flute, Dodgeball, Horse Riding, Skiing, Choir, Meditation, Podcast/Media, Swimming (the school has its own pool), Chess Club, Film-making, Zumba, Hockey, Puzzle Club, Arts and Crafts, French, Quiz Club, Netball, Ravenspell, Judo, Journalism Club, Football, Rhythmic Gymnastics plus many more.

In 1941 he was the Croatian First League's top scorer while playing for Građanski, and performed the same feat twice in the Yugoslavian First League as well: in 1938 and 1939. He played for the Yugoslavian football team in the late 1930s and the Croatian national team from 1940 to 1944.
Club career.
Lešnik started his career in 1929 playing for local club HŠK Derby. He spent there five years, and after that had a short spell in HŠK Šparta Zagreb. In 1936 Lešnik started playing for Građanski Zagreb, the club where spent most of his career. In the first four years at Građanski, he was twice the top goalscorer of Yugoslav First League. In the 1937–38 season he scored 17 goals in 18 matches, and the following season 22 goals in as much games. He clinched two titles with Građanski in 1937 and 1940, and one of his most famous club matches occurred in spring 1937 against BSK in Belgrade in which Lešnik scored a hat-trick in the first seven minutes of the game.

Heteronym (linguistics)

A heteronym (also known as a heterophone) is a word that is written identically but has a different pronunciation and meaning. In other words, they are homographs that are not homophones. Thus, "row" (propel with oars) and "row" (argument) are heteronyms, but "mean" (intend) and "mean" (average) are not (since they are pronounced the same). Heteronym pronunciation may vary in vowel realisation, in stress pattern (see also Initial-stress-derived noun), or in other ways:
Most heteronyms are doubles. Triple heteronyms are extremely rare; two examples, "sin" and "mobile", are listed below. Proper nouns can sometimes be heteronyms. For example, the final syllable of Oregon is pronounced like the word "in" by residents of that state in the United States, while in the name of the village of Oregon in Wisconsin, the final syllable is pronounced like the word "on". Other examples include local pronunciations of Cairo, GA, Versailles, KY, and Milan, TN. There are also pairs which include both initialisms and regular words, e.g., "US" and "us". 
Heteronyms can also occur in non-alphabetic languages. For example, the Chinese character 行 can be pronounced "háng", meaning "profession", or "xíng", meaning "OK".
"Heterophone" literally just means "different sound", and this term is sometimes applied to words that are just pronounced differently, irrespective of their spelling. Such a definition would obviously include virtually every pair of words in the language, so "heterophone" in this sense is normally restricted to instances where there is some particular reason to highlight the different sound. For example, puns normally involve homophones, but in the case of heterophonic (or imperfect) puns, the two words sound different, and yet similar enough for one to suggest the other (for example, "mouth" and "mouse").

Prejudice-gva

Prejudice gva is a hardcore/punkrock band from Geneva, Switzerland.
History.
Prejudice, who originally began making noise in 1993 in a Geneva (Switzerland) squat basement, has seen both their music and line up evolve throughout the years. Founded by two brothers, and having played during two years as a three piece band (with no band name during this area...) everywhere in Geneva, they played the first show under the name of Prejudice as a five piece band in November 1995. One demotape later, Prejudice signs on Swiss label Division Records and releases a first CDEP in 1996. Later that year, the band records 3 songs for a split 7’’ with American act Faction Zero.
While playing more and more shows, Prejudice continues to write new songs. The band gets back in the studio in 1998 to release Inner Struggle, a 6-track CDEP on Hannibal’s Records a few months later. On the same label, the genevan band will release another 7’’ and, finally, the debut full-length which was lacking in its discography. Between Happiness & Self Destruction, produced by Jerôme Pellegrini (guitarist of Nostromo/mumakil), is released in 2001. To promote this new record, Prejudice tours across Switzerland with Body Bag and NRA, and goes out on a three-week European tour.
Two years and lots of shows later, Prejudice gets ready for a second full-length. But right before going in the studio, two long-time members decide to quit. It is with a new guitar player and Knut (Hydra Head Records) bassist Jeremy (Taverne) that Prejudice eventually records nine new songs at Serge Morattel’s Rec Studio (Knut, Tantrum, Impure Wilhelmina, Overmars, Hateful Monday). The new record, L’enfer c’est les autres…, has been mastered by Alan Douches (Converge, Snapcase, Hatebreed, Mastodon) at West West Side and is released by the Swiss record label GPS Prod.
Mixing the different schools of hardcore while still staying true to its roots, L’Enfer c’est les autres… which includes three tracks in French emphasizes the comeback of one of the most appreciated Swiss hardcore acts.
Active since more than a decade, Prejudice gva (because that is the new full name of the band) is a passionate and sincere band who has been through more line-up changes than most band could endure. But driven by passion and not by trends Prejudice gva has still a lot to give to the underground scene inside which it has always evolved. Having toured Europe, played everywhere in their home country and shared the stage with international references such as Refused, Sick of it All, Most Precious Blood, Madball, Avail, Integrity, Ensign, Kill Your Idols, Cataract, Knut, Nostromo, Caliban, Knuckeldust, 25 Ta Life, NRA, Oi Polloi,Gorilla biscuits,Uk subs... Prejudice-gva has also proved that its rockin’hardcore is built for the stage.

Claudiopolis (Cilicia)

Claudiopolis () also called Ninica and Ninica Claudiopolis, mentions Silifke and Claudiopolis as cities of Cilicia, or of the country drained by the Calycadnus; and Claudiopolis was a colony of Claudius Caesar. It is described by Theophanes of Byzantium as situated in a plain between the two Taurus Mountains, a description which exactly, corresponds to the position of the basin of the Calycadnus. Claudiopolis may therefore be represented by Mut, which is higher up the valley than Seleucia, and near the junction of the northern and western branches of the Calycadnus. It is also the place to which the pass over the northern Taurus leads from Laranda. Pliny (v. 24) mentions a Claudiopolis of Cappadocia, and Ptolemy (v. 7) has a Claudiopolis in Cataonia. Both these passages and those of Ammianus and Theophanes are cited to prove that there is a Claudiopolis in Cataonia, though it is manifest that the passage in Ammianus at least can only apply to a town in the valley of the Calycadnus in Cilicia Trachea. The two Tauri of Theophanes might mean the Taurus and Antitaurus. But Hierocles places Claudiopolis in Isauria, a description which cannot apply to the Claudiopolis(es) of Pliny and Ptolemy. The city apparently received the Roman colony name Colonia Iulia Felix Augusta Ninica, and minted coins in antiquity.

List of segregationists during the African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–68)

This is a list of segregationists during the American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968). Many public figures, particularly in the South, defended compulsory racial segregation as an institution during the Civil Rights Movement, and many others did not condemn it. This list comprises those people who publicly supported segregation at the time, although many later modified or recanted their position as public sentiment shifted (and the number of African American voters in their areas increased).

<doc id="9640240" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9640240" title="James Madison (bishop)">
James Madison (bishop)

James Madison (August 27, 1749 – March 6, 1812) was the first bishop of the Diocese of Virginia of The Episcopal Church in the United States, one of the first bishops to be consecrated to the new church after the American Revolution. He also served as the eighth president of the College of William and Mary.
Youth, education.
Born in Port Republic, in Augusta County, near Staunton, Virginia, he was the son of John and Agatha (née Strother) Madison. He was educated at home and at a private school in Maryland, before attending the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia where he graduated with high honors in 1771. On July 29, 1772, he received the gold medal given as a prize for classical learning by the Royal Governor of Virginia, Norborne Berkeley, 4th Baron Botetourt, who is better known in Virginia as "Lord Botetourt".
He read law with George Wythe, and was admitted to the bar, though he did not practice law.
Dual career: educator and theologian.
Madison taught philosophy and mathematics at the college from 1773 to 1775, when he went to England to be ordained a priest of the Church of England. He returned to the Colony of Virginia, and was serving as an instructor at William and Mary as the hostilities which led to the American Revolutionary War broke out.
He was a cousin of James Madison, Jr. (1751–1836), who was a member of the Virginia General Assembly, U.S. Representative in the first four sessions of the United States Congress, and the fourth President of the United States. Both Madisons were heavily involved in the issues of freedom of religion and the separation of church and state.
In 1777, Madison served as chaplain of the Virginia House of Delegates and organized his students into a militia company. The same year, Loyalist sympathies of the college's president, the Reverend John Camm (who had been the initial litigant in the Parson's Cause case 1758-1764), brought about Madison's removal from the faculty. But later, Madison became the eighth president of the College of William and Mary in October 1777, the first after separation from England.
As the College's President, Madison worked with the new leaders of Virginia, most notably Thomas Jefferson, on a reorganization and changes for the College which included the abolition of the Divinity School and the Indian School, which was also known as the Brafferton School. The 1693 royal charter provided that Indian School of the College educate American Indian youth. The College's founder, Reverend Dr. James Blair had arranged financing for that purpose using dedicated income from England which was interrupted by the Revolutionary War. By 1779, the Brafferton School had permanently closed, although "The Brafferton", as it is known in modern times, remains a landmark building dating to the Colonial Period on the campus. Along with establishment of new, firmer financial footing, the creation of the graduate schools in law and medicine officially made the "College" a school meeting the contemporary definition of a "university" by 1779, notwithstanding the retention of the word College in the original name (as set forth in the 1693 Royal Charter).
The Reverend Dr. Madison also presided over the first convention of the newly formed Diocese of Virginia of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America in 1785 and was consecrated as a bishop on September 19, 1790, in Canterbury, England. Despite the concerns of some patriots, the Right Reverend Dr. Madison, or Bishop James Madison, as he came to be known, successfully served both the College of William and Mary and the Diocese of Virginia separately during the important transitional period.
He remained as President of the College of William and Mary for 35 years, serving until his death. When he died on March 6, 1812, he was interred in the chapel of the College in Williamsburg, Virginia.
Heritage.
Although he is not generally regarded as one of the founding fathers of the United States, his role in successfully helping restructure and lead both the College of William and Mary and the Church of England in the United States during and after the American Revolution was a major contribution to the new country. In modern times, Madison Hall at the College's campus adjacent to Colonial Williamsburg is named in his honor, as is the Bishop James Madison Society, a secret society which was founded in 1812 immediately after his death.

<doc id="9640381" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9640381" title="METRO Red Line">
METRO Red Line

The METRO Red Line, previously known as the Cedar Avenue Bus Rapid Transitway, is a bus line between the Twin Cities suburbs of Bloomington, Minnesota and Apple Valley, Minnesota. The Red Line is being built with bus rapid transit elements including dedicated bus lanes along the sides of Minnesota State Highway 77/County Road 23, as well as large, widely spaced stations. The line is planned to be extended to the suburb of Lakeville, Minnesota, eventually running from Mall of America in Bloomington, the southern terminus of the Blue Line light-rail service, to 215th Street in Lakeville.
After a few construction schedule setbacks, the line officially began operation on June 22, 2013.
Background.
The corridor has seen rapidly increasing traffic volumes over the past 20 years due to explosive growth in Dakota County. Traffic congestion is a commonplace along much of the corridor as far south as County Road 42. The Metropolitan Council, county, and local officials are promoting the transitway as a means to improve mobility in the corridor.
The Red Line serves the Mall of America in Bloomington to the Apple Valley Transit Station (and will later serve the 215th Street in Lakeville), serving some of the fastest growing areas in the Metropolitan Area and in the State of Minnesota. Traffic volumes on Cedar Avenue currently exceed 100,000 vehicles a day at the Minnesota River bridge on any given morning, with congestion sometimes extending as far south as County Road 42 in Apple Valley, Johnny Cake Road and Garden View Road, as well as even the largest highways & county roads of Pilot Knob and State Highway 3 (Between Eagan and Rosemount), a distance of several miles away. The cities of Lakeville, Farmington, and Eagan are projected to double in population between the year 2000 and 2025, and the City of Apple Valley will gain half again its current population: 90,000 more residents in the Corridor. Red Line Bus Rapid Transit buses have more futuristic commercial detail and other features, such as elevators, stairs and such at bus stations. Cedar Avenue has been reconstructed with new bus shoulder lanes for easier travel between Downtown Minneapolis and Lakeville. The Transitway begins at Mall of America towards Eagan, Lakeville, and Apple Valley with bus shoulder lanes on both sides of Cedar Avenue, making it easier to bypass traffic. Stations have been designed with bus pull offs to allow express buses to pass buses picking up and dropping off passengers.
Line color.
In July 2011, the Metropolitan Council officially designated the Cedar Avenue BRT line as the Red Line. This is part of a broader scheme to designate Minneapolis-St. Paul transit lines by color. Corresponding lines within the system include the Blue Line, the Green Line and the Orange Line (under construction BRT line along Interstate 35W).

The Theology of Aristotle

The Theology of Aristotle is a paraphrase of parts of Plotinus' "Six Enneads" along with Porphyry's commentary into Arabic. It was traditionally attributed to Aristotle, but as this attribution is certainly untrue it is conventional to describe the author as "Pseudo-Aristotle". It had a significant effect on early Islamic philosophy, due to Islamic interest in Aristotle. Al-Kindi (Alkindus) and Avicenna, for example, were influenced by Plotinus' works. The translator attempted to integrate Aristotle's ideas with those of Plotinus — while trying to make Plotinus compatible with Christianity and Islam, thus yielding a unique synthesis.
"The Theology of Aristotle", with "The Letter on Divine Science" and "The Sayings of the Greek Sage," a collection of fragments, together form the "Plotiniana Arabica". They seem to have been adapted by Ibn Na'ima al-Himsi, a Christian, and edited by Al-Kindi, a Muslim.
There is also a longer version of the "Theology," the authorship of which is uncertain. According to Shlomo Pines, it may have been written by Isma'ilis. Paul Fenton, on the other hand, thought it may have been derived from Egyptian Jews.
Just as there is an Arabic paraphrase of Plotinus' Six Enneads, blending it with Aristotle's thought, so also there is an Arabic paraphrase of Aristotle's "De Anima," blending it with Plotinus' thought. Thus later Islamic philosophy, and European philosophy which built on the Islamic philosophical texts, were based on this Neoplatonic synthesis.

Bambi's Children

"Bambi's Children, The Story of a Forest Family, originally titled Bambis Kinder, eine Familie im Walde", is a German Children's novel written by Felix Salten as a sequel to his successful work "Bambi, A Life in the Woods". The sequel follows the lives of the twin children of Bambi and his cousin Faline as they grow from fawns through adulthood. Salten wrote the sequel while living in exile in Switzerland after being forced to flee Nazi occupied Austria as he was of Jewish heritage. Originally written in German, the novel was first published in English in the United States in 1939 by Bobbs-Merrill. It was not published in Germany until the following year. Its language is gentler than that of "Bambi, A Life in the Woods". Perri, a squirrel character from one of Salten's earlier novels, makes brief appearances in the book.
Plot.
Twin fawns (from the ending of the first novel), Geno and Gurri learn the pleasures as well as downsides of nature and their forest home, as their mother Faline raises them to adulthood. Their father, Faline's cousin Bambi, watches over them and, at times, takes care of them while their mother is busy. During their lives, they interact with Lana and Boso, twin fawns of their Aunt Rolla.
One day, Gurri gets attacked by a fox, but survives. She's then taken away by a gamekeeper (but is mostly known as the, "brown He" by some of the animals, because of the brown coat he wears). When she's brought to the "brown He's" place. She meets his dog, Hector, and an owl, that He found awhile ago. The owl is chained to a post, and he tells Gurri about the times when the small birds (that the owl preys on) came to attack him. Then Bambi comes, and he tells Gurri that he'll come at anytime to teach her how to jump over the gate. When the "brown He" comes, Bambi runs back into the forest, and when he does that, the "brown He" opens the gate and leaves. Gurri then takes the opportunity to leave.
When she comes back, tension's between her family and Rolla's family start to rise. First, Rolla asks Gurri to tell her what had happened, but she is too tired to talk about it. The next day, Rolla again demands Gurri to tell her, but she just wants to play with Lana and Boso. Then one day, Rolla gets attacked by a wolf-dog. And while trying to escape him, she accidentally lures the wolf-dog to where Faline and the others are hiding. The wolf-dog immediately turns his attention to Geno, and chases him instead. When Faline gets word of Geno's disappearance, she blames Rolla for "sacrificing" her son. After Bambi saves Geno from the wolf dog, Geno finds Rolla, and he is then reunited with his sister and mother. When they go to see Rolla, Lana gives them a warm welcome, while Boso, starts developing a hate for them. He starts antagonizing Geno a bit, then scolds Faline for not sending them a messenger about their mother being injured. When Faline and her children leave, a feud between the two families is then started.
When Geno starts to grow his antlers, he and Gurri discover two orphaned male fawns named Nello and Membo. Faline decides to adopt them as new friends for her children, so they can forget about their new enemies. When Geno gets older, he meets Lana again, and starts developing feelings for her. But then Boso comes out and challenges Geno to a fight, but Geno refuses. Boso starts to spread rumors across the forest about Geno being a coward. When Geno has had enough, he fights Boso and defeats him, he offers a truce, but Boso instead turns away. Geno tries to apologise to Lana, but she refuses to talk to him after that.
Then one day, Boso is shot by a boy hunter, but before the boy could kill him he escapes. He then runs into Bambi, and Bambi has him do the same techniques that his father, the Great Prince, told him to do when he got shot. The boy then returns and tries to kill Geno, but right when he is about to kill him, Bambi jumps out and kills him. 
In the end, Lana forgives Geno for what he did to Boso, and the two families end their feud and become friends again. When they have all left, Faline notices a "well-beloved shadow" in the bushes (obviously Bambi), and she goes towards it.
Dell Comic.
Although this story was never made into a film adaption, Dell Comics published a Walt Disney Production story in 1943.

New Haven Free Public Library

The New Haven Free Public Library (also known as the NHFPL) is the public library system serving New Haven, Connecticut.
The system began in 1887 in a leased location but quickly outgrew its space. The Ives Memorial Library is the main branch of the system and is located on the New Haven Green. The neo-Georgian building was designed by Cass Gilbert and finished in 1911. This building was renovated and expanded in 1990.
Murals in the main library originated as Public Works Administration projects. Two lunettes in the main hall, designed by Bancel LaFarge of Mt. Carmel, Connecticut, depict scenes from New Haven's history. The Rip Van Winkle murals in the meeting room were painted in 1934 by a team of artists led by Salvatore DiNaio and Frank J. Rutkowski. There is also a set of stained glass windows in the Ives Library designed by David Wilson of South New Berlin, New York including circular and rectangular laylights as well as rectangular and half-round windows.
There are also neighborhood branches in Westville (Mitchell), Fair Haven, Dixwell (Stetson) and The Hill (Wilson). The Wilson branch features an art installation by Leila Daw depicting patterns of immigration.
In April 2012, the library underwent a significant rebranding effort in celebration of its 125th anniversary. In addition to updates in design and significant changes in borrowing policies, the library also adopted a retitled NHFPL125+ classification.

Toddler bed

A toddler bed is a small bed designed for toddlers. A child grows capable of escaping an infant bed around two or three years of age, at which they are often transitioned to a toddler bed. They become too large for a toddler bed between the ages of five and seven years, and will then transition to an ordinary bed. 
Commonly toddler beds have low side rails (cot sides, possibly removable) on each side to prevent accidental rolling out of the bed while asleep, rather than being fully enclosed like an infant bed. A toddler bed is low to the ground to facilitate safe and easy entry and exit for the occupant. The mattress in a toddler bed is often the same size as that in an infant bed. Generally toddler beds range from 70 cm x 140 cm to 78 cm x 180 cm. As toddlers are learning to express their tastes, licensed or themed beds to appeal to their preferences are available (for example, a racing car bed).

Muir–Torre syndrome

Muir–Torre syndrome (MTS) is a rare hereditary, autosomal dominant cancer syndrome that is thought to be a subtype of HNPCC. Individuals are prone to develop cancers of the colon, breast, and genitourinary tract, and skin lesions, such as keratoacanthomas and sebaceous tumors. The genes affected are MLH1, MSH2, and more recently, MSH6, and are involved in DNA mismatch repair.
Symptoms.
Muir-Torre Syndrome is characterized by both:
The Amsterdam criteria are frequently used to diagnose Lynch syndrome and Muir–Torre syndrome. They include the following:
Muir-Torre Syndrome is a genetic condition. Mutations in MLH1 and MSH2 are linked with the disease. These genes code for DNA mismatch repair genes, and mutations increase the risk of developing cancerous qualities.
Incidence.
Muir-Torre was observed to occur in 14 of 50 families (28%) and in 14 of 152 individuals (9.2%) with Lynch Syndrome, also known as HNPCC.
The 2 major MMR proteins involved are hMLH1 and hMSH2. Approximately 70% of tumors associated with the MTS have microsatellite instability. While germline disruption of hMLH1 and hMSH2 is evenly distributed in HNPCC, disruption of hMSH2 is seen in greater than 90% of MTS patients.
Gastrointestinal and genitourinary cancers are the most common internal malignancies. Colorectal cancer is the commonest visceral neoplasm in Muir–Torre syndrome patients.
Treatment.
Immunohistochemistry is now being used more often to diagnose patients likely to have Muir-Torre. Sebaceous neoplasms are only infrequently encountered, and immunohistochemistry is reliable and readily available, so researchers have recommended its use. Routine immunohistochemical detection of DNA mismatch repair proteins help identify hereditary DNA mismatch repair deficiency.
Treatment of Muir-Torre normally consists of oral isotretinoin. The drug has been found to prevent tumor development.
Eponym.
It is named for EG Muir and D Torre.
Genetic Overlap with Turcot Syndrome.
A couple studies have been conducted on patients with both Muir-Torre Syndrome and Turcot Syndrome. It is thought that the two may have some genetic overlap. Both have been associated defects in MLH1 and MSH2 genes.
In one study, a patient with defective MSH2 and MSH6 mismatch repair genes exhibited both syndromes. This is the first case where a patient with genotypic changes consistent with HNPCC has been properly diagnosed with an overlap of both syndromes. Along with neoplasms of the sebaceous gland, this patient developed cerebral neoplasms, characteristic of Turcot Syndrome.

Leslie A. Lyons

Leslie A. Lyons is an associate professor at University of Missouri School of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery.
Career.
In 2002, Dr. Lyons made international headlines by analyzing the DNA of the world's first cloned cat, a kitten named
, and confirming that it was indeed a true clone, a genetic copy of its mother.
Dr. Lyons has helped develop DNA tests for polycystic kidney disease (PKD), an inherited condition that shortens the life of cats by causing them to suffer kidney cysts. Previous tests for this condition involved ultrasound and were not very accurate, unlike the DNA test devised by Dr. Lyons. Approximately one third of all Persian cats carried the PKD gene at one time, but because of ultrasound testing and the newer, more accurate DNA tests, these PKD-carrier cats are gradually being identified and removed from the feline gene pool by spaying and neutering.
A DNA test for feline coat color carriers and feline parentage has also been developed by Dr. Lyons, and is being offered to cat breeders, like the PKD test, so that they can determine whether cats they have bred have correct pedigrees, and whether these cats carry colorpoints, Burmese Colour Restriction, long hair, colour dilution or rare coat colors, such as chocolate and cinnamon.
One of Dr. Lyons' current projects is identification of the genes that cause head defect, a lethal deformity in American Burmese cats. She is also working on identifying genes that cause Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA), which causes affected kittens to become blind at the age of approximately two months.
Although much of Dr. Lyons' research has dealt with cats, she also works on resources for gene mapping of other companion animals, such as dogs and horses. She has a partial appointment with the California National Primate Research Center and is developing new genetic research for the rhesus macaque.

Freddy Curci

Federico "Freddy" Curci is a Canadian album-oriented rock vocalist and songwriter. He was a member of Alias and Sheriff.
Curci has a multi-octave vocal range and holds the Guinness World Record for Longest Note Held in a pop song, for 30 seconds, timed and submitted by University of Houston, for the ending note of "When I'm with You."
Curci's vocals earned the Sheriff song "When I'm with You" the Number 1 spot in 1989 and the Alias power ballad "More Than Words Can Say" the Number 2 spot in 1990 on the Billboard charts.
BMI presented Curci with the Million-airs award for "More Than Words Can Say." According to BMI’s web site, only 1,500 songs have achieved Million-air status (one million air plays) among the 4.5 million songs by 300,000 BMI represented artists. One million performances is the equivalent of approximately 50,000 broadcast hours, or more than 5.7 years of continuous airplay. 
In January 2009, Alias announced the release of their long delayed second album. This album titled "Never Say Never" sat unreleased for 18 years. The second album was recorded in 1992 to follow Alias's debut album, but it was never released due to the rapidly evolving music scene of that time where Grunge was the new rage and metal was out. A few of the songs from this “lost” album were re-recorded and appeared on Curci’s solo album "Dreamer’s Road", but the rest remained unreleased. Some live performances are expected in 2009 in support of this new album release, but tour dates and band member lineup are yet to be announced.
Curci is one of the few rock vocalists with multi-octave singing ranges able to hit high notes without resorting to falsetto.
Early influences.
Of Italian descent, Curci grew up in Toronto, Canada. At an early age Curci listened mostly to classical opera music. He started listening to Black Sabbath and other rock music in his teenage years. Aside from opera music, some of Curci's musical influences were Lou Gramm of Foreigner and Tom Johnston of the The Doobie Brothers.
Before Sheriff, Curci performed in Italian wedding bands in Toronto.
Songwriting career.
As a Billboard top 10 hit songwriter, Curci co-wrote with his Sheriff and Alias bandmate Steve DeMarchi the Number 2 hit song "More Than Words Can Say", and the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks Number 18 hit song “Haunted Heart." He also co-wrote most of the songs on the "Alias" album, his solo album "Dreamer’s Road" and the "Zion" album.
Curci is also a songwriter for the motion picture industry. In 2007, Curci’s songs were featured in several episodes of "Army Wives", the most-watched series premiere in the 23 year history of the Lifetime Network. Curci was the primary composer for the sitcom Two Guys and a Girl (2000–2001), and also wrote the title theme.
In addition to DeMarchi, accomplished writers Curci has collaborated with include Brett Walker; Jeff Paris; Romina Arena; Jason Hook; his wife, Lara Cody; F. Grossi; Donny Hackett and Douglas Vallance.

<doc id="9640647" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9640647" title="Tortilla Price Stabilization Pact">
Tortilla Price Stabilization Pact

The Tortilla Price Stabilization Pact was an agreement between the Mexican Federal Government, headed by President Felipe Calderón, and several tortilla producing companies in Mexico to limit the volatility of price in tortillas in early 2007.
Background.
The international price of corn (maize) had been rising dramatically throughout 2006, leading to the inflation of tortilla prices in the first month of Calderón's term. Because tortillas are the main food product consumed by Mexico's poorest people, national concern over the rising prices immediately generated political pressures for Calderón's administration.
The Pact.
President Calderón opted for using price ceilings for tortillas that protect local producers of corn. This price control came in the form of a "Tortilla Price Stabilization Pact" between the government and many of the main tortilla producing companies, including Grupo Maseca and Bimbo, to put a price ceiling at MXN 8.50 per kilogram of tortilla. The idea of the agreement is that having these producers ceiling their prices would incentive the market to lower the prices nationally.
Criticism.
The Pact has been heavily criticized by both the right and the left. Critics argue that the Pact was both non-binding and a "de facto" acceptance of a 30% increase in the price of that product (from MXN 5.95 to 8.50 per kilogram). Many "tortillerías" ignored the agreement, leading to price increases in well in excess of the 8.50 pesos. Government opposition see this as an indication of the failure to protect the economy of poor consumers. In response to this, PROFECO, the government consumer protection agency, has also threatened with jail those tortilla producers who charge "excessive" prices.
However, some major supermarkets such as Soriana, or Comercial Mexicana sell their tortillas at a lower price than the one in the agreement, and even 14% lower than the original price, reaching even MXN 5.10 per kilogram. That is interpreted by liberals as evidence that price controls, and the Tortilla Price Stabilization Pact, were unnecessary and potentially harmful for the market.
Results.
Three months after the pact was signed, the Secretariat of Economy has informed that the price of tortillas was reduced in most of the country's 53 largest cities. However, in 27 cities and 15 states the price is above the agreed 8.50 pesos. In fact, in Tijuana, Morelia, San Luis Potosí, Ciudad Victoria, and Nuevo Laredo the price of tortillas has risen, despite the fact that the average price of maize has dropped from MXN 3,500 to 2,500 per ton. However, the Director of the Maize Industry Council has defended the pact by minimizing the price increments in those cities, claiming that the pact was only intended for the Valley of Mexico, and not the whole country.
Guillermo Ortiz Martínez, governor of the Bank of Mexico, labeled the agreement "a success" for consumers, and urged for it to continue as means to combat rising inflation.

Hickman Mills, Kansas City

Hickman Mills is a neighborhood of Kansas City, Missouri and the Kansas City Metropolitan Area. There is good access to the Interstate and Federal highway system, with I-435, I-470, and US-71/I-49 running through the area, including the Grandview Triangle. It also includes Longview Lake and Longview Community College. It is covered by the Hickman Mills C-1 School District.
History.
Positioned near the junction of the Santa Fe, California and Oregon trails (called the Three Trails area), Hickman Mills is located in the southern part of Kansas City, Missouri, and at one time was a separate community until it was annexed by the city in 1961. The town site was originally platted in 1845 by Randall Allen; it received its name when in 1854 Edwin Alfred Hickman purchased 40 acres in Washington Township to build a steam-powered grist and saw mill along Hart Grove Creek. He had moved down from Independence when wood became scarce for his mill there and he sought to take advantage of the large amount of traffic on the nearby Santa Fe Trail at that time. Its current given name is due to a clerical error in the second half of the 19th century; when the community around Hickman's Mill applied for a federal post office, the officer in Washington, DC, mangled the name to "Hickman Mills". As late as 1930 a plat of the area still referred to it as "Hickman's Mill", while older maps even listed it as "Hickmans Mills". The exact location of the mill is not known however one reference indicates that it was about 100 feet north of the junction of Hickman Mills Drive and Hillcrest Road, next to Hart Grove Creek which originally ran about 50 feet west, and about 300 feet south of the town center. During the Financial Panic of 1857 local banks closed and credit and money became scarce; Hickman had extended credit to so many in the community that he himself became insolvent and the mill closed just a few years later in 1859. Hickman ended up going west to look for gold in Colorado and the mill was sold, the lumber from the mill being used to build other structures. An Independence milling company purchased the equipment, and a local neighbor, Solomon Young (great-grandfather to President Harry S Truman) used some of the lumber to build a barn. A pool used by the mill for boiler water was converted to use for baptisms of the nearby church. Even with the mill gone and the Santa Fe Trail growing into disuse after 1870, the town continued to grow, with the local Post Office serving the residents of both Hickman Mills and what became the town of Grandview, 4 miles south. Rail service arrived a few years later, connecting the town directly to Kansas City.
The War Years.
The area surrounding Hickman Mills suffered greatly during the Civil War; Jayhawkers looted and pillaged while guerillas led by men such as William Quantrill frequented the town and fought the Jayhawkers as well as against Federal troops. The opening scenes in the Clint Eastwood western "Outlaw Josey Wales" are to have taken place in Jackson County and depict the Civil War in Missouri; other movies such as "Ride with the Devil" did the same and was partially filmed in neighboring Clay County.
The survival of Hickman Mills during the Civil War was largely due to one man. Charles Jefferys was a prominent business man who emigrated from Belgium, heir to a fortune from holdings in the British West Indies. The young civil engineer purchased up to 1800 acres in various tracts between the Blue and Little Blue rivers in Washington Township, including land around Hickman's Mill. Using immigrant and slave labor, he built two mansions in the area, and a large portion of his land now contains one of the two local high schools, Ruskin High School. Jefferys suffered during the Civil War as many did here. His farm manager, Jacob Palmer, learned that Jayhawkers planned to murder Jefferys, ostensibly under the assumption that he had assisted the local rebel guerillas and for his ownership of slaves. William Quantrill often stayed at the farm of David Tate on Red Bridge, just two miles away, and one of Quantrill's lieutenants, George Todd, owned a farm along the Blue River at Red Bridge (he and his father built the original Red Bridge over the river). Learning of the threat, Jefferys' wife begged him to leave, but as he feared the Jayhawkers would burn the farm, he remained while sending his wife and children to Philadelphia to stay with his wife's family. His farm had been visited by men asking for Jefferys' assistance; Henry Younger, father of guerilla and future Jesse James Gang member Cole Younger, had been shot and was at Dodson, a small community north west at the current location of 85th Street and Prospect. Palmer had been asked to bring the body back to Hickman Mills for it to be picked up and taken back to Younger's home in Harrisonville. Palmer did make the trip to Dodson, but discovered Union soldiers had already moved it to Olathe, in Kansas. The following month, Quantrill and his men captured Independence, prompting numerous reprisal raids by Jayhawkers. Local farmers armed themselves and in one instance, captured several Jayhawkers looting a local home. Not wanting to keep the prisoners for any length of time, they attempted to take them to local authorities and had stopped at Jefferys farm when they were intercepted by a Quantrill patrol. Quantrill's men took charge of the prisoners, led them out the large gate where Ruskin High School now stands, and disappeared into the brush near the Little Blue river. It is assumed they were executed by Quantrill immediately after.
During this period occurred the Raid on Lawrence, Kansas by Quantrill and 450 of his men. The raid was a reprisal for a number of incidents and resulted in Lawrence being completely burned, and most of the male residents being murdered. The end result of this raid was the issuance of General Order No. 11, which ordered all residents of Jackson County and nearby counties to leave their homes and the county immediately. The exceptions were for those who lived within a mile of a military post and had taken an oath of loyalty to the Union. All property left behind was to be burned or confiscated by the military. One of Jefferys' homes became a military post, Post Number One. Thirty-two local families lived at his farm for the duration of the war, their farms and property destroyed. Palmer at one point recounted seeing seventeen houses in a circle all around their property in flames. The Order's goal was to break the rebellion in Jackson County and halt the support of the local guerillas, but it instead hardened the resolve of Quantrill and his men, who continued to fight with widespread support of the local populace. After Confederate General Sterling Price's incursion back into Missouri, the area was devastated further by both northern and southern soldiers in the battles that raged throughout the county and rampant looting that occurred as troops, Jayhawkers, and bushwhackers transited the area.[http://www.kansascity.com/2012/07/02/3688060/preservationist-group-sees-new.html#storylink=misearch]
Growth after 1865.
It took decades for the area to recover from the devastation of the war; most anthologies of the Civil War neglect the battles that took place on the western frontier. While the battles in the east were vast and impersonal, the war in Missouri and Kansas were very personal, pitting neighbors and families against one another after the passage of the Kansas Nebraska Act of 1854. Charles Jefferys was owed $20,000 by the military at the close of the war; it was never repaid and Jefferys ended up relocating to Philadelphia permanently. His properties and farms continued to be run; however Jeffereys' son returned to Hickman Mills to slowly sell off the land. The last section was sold in 1905. A large portion ended as the current location of Ruskin High School, another portion, donated by the family in 1899, was to become a rail stop and depot for the community. When the St. Louis and San Francisco (FRISCO) rail line wanted to build a stop nearby, the family donated the land on condition it be named for the family. Thus, the depot of Jefferys was established one half mile west of Hickman Mills, along Red Bridge Road west of current US-71. The station had an agent and telegraph service until 1914, when the depot was destroyed by fire. Service continued until 1954, however passengers had to flag the train to stop. In recent years the rails have been completely removed, Red Bridge Road realigned, and the location of the original stop and depot are approximately where the off-ramp of southbound US-71 now exists.
After the war life resumed and the first school was built in 1866 and was located at what is now the SE corner of Hillcrest Road and Longview road; the land was donated by local farmer George Hedges and the school named Hedges school. A later structure, Hickman School, was built in 1916 after consolidation with Jones school two miles west and was the first permanent brick school. It was located at what is now the corner of Longview Road and Grandview Road, about 1/2 mile west of the original. This building, one of the four original schools to comprise the new Hickman Mills C-1 School District still stands but has been out of service as a school since 1980.
Most of the homes in the area were built in the early to mid-1950s and 1960s, although a handful of houses that are pre-1920 exist at the original town center located at the corner of Hillcrest Road and Red Bridge Road, just east of US-71. At this corner exists the beautiful stone church complex known as Hickman Mills Community Church. The church, originally established in 1845 at 87th Street and Raytown Road in Raytown, was relocated to Hickman Mills and is the third oldest Christian church in Jackson County. The church was built on land donated by Hickman and was located north of the mill, and was a frame structure built in a conservative style with two front doors, one for men and one for women. By 1896 the congregation had expanded to 75 members and a larger structure was constructed. By 1929 the congregation had again doubled and the ornate stone building that exists today was built; this building received an award from the Kansas City chapter of the American Institute of Architects as well as 1st prize from a church architecture competition sponsored by the Christian Herald. One of the millstones from Hickman's Mill can still be seen at the church.
North east of the church is a smaller stone building with the date "1921" on the face which once served as the town bank. Across from the original bank building is an old frame structure that served as a community center and post office with a gymnasium on the 2nd floor, and next door is the original telephone exchange building. In the early 50's the telephone exchange for Hickman Mills was "DW", for DWight. During the later 50's and 60's it was "SO", for SOuthland. About 1/2 mile east of town center along Red Bridge Road on the north side near the fire station is a monument to General Order No. 11, the Civil War-era action that forced residents of this and adjoining counties to leave their farms immediately.
The local area included the former Bannister Mall and other shopping centers and has seen a decline in the past few years, with most of the buildings vacant and the mall, once the largest in the region, torn down in 2009.
The Santa Fe Trail featured prominently in the early years of the settlement's founding. It entered the area along what is now Old Santa Fe Road from 87th Street (forming the boundary of the current Hickman Mills High School and Santa Fe Elementary), turned at Palestine Cemetery (founded 1876), then turned at what is now 93rd Street. From 93rd Street it crossed the property that once contained the Mall, turned west down Bannister Road (formerly County Highway W) and turned south at the town of Holmes Park between what is now Marion Park Dr. (the former rail bed of the FRISCO line) and Hickman Mills Drive (old US-71) to a point about one mile northwest of the original town site. It eventually crossed the Blue River at a ford just north of the existing bridge along Red Bridge Road at Minor Park, about 2 1/2 miles due west of town. A spur from the trail may have run towards Hickman's Mill; starting at 93rd Street at Palestine Cemetery, it would have run south along what is now Bennington Avenue to Red Bridge Road, but further research is needed. The location of one of the current high schools, Hickman Mills Sr. High (and the adjoining Santa Fe Elementary) is on the grounds of a Santa Fe Trail campsite. About one mile away is a small park (Schumacher Park) commemorating the Santa Fe Trail with maps of the route through Hickman Mills and other information.
In 1957 the Ruskin Heights Tornado ripped through the area, before hitting Ruskin Heights, killing 44 and destroying hundreds of buildings including Ruskin High School. The school was rebuilt and a monument to the victims of the tornado is located near the school at the corner of Longview Road and Blue Ridge Extension.

The Children of Golzow

The Children of Golzow (German: Die Kinder von Golzow) is a documentary by the German filmmaker Winfried Junge that was started in 1961 and lasted until 2007, when the series concluded. The film is a prolonged observation of the lives of several people in the Brandenburg town of Golzow. 
In 1985, the episode "Lebensläufe" got into the Guinness Book of World Records as the movie with the longest production period. There is also a museum about the documentary in Golzow.
Introduction.
Eighteen people who were born from 1953 to 1955 were observed by camera from 1961 to 2007 by Junge and his wife, Barbara. The filmmaker dealt with the personal situations (such as deaths of relatives) of the characters and filmed them in dramatic situations.
Social aspect.
The films reflect not only the individual life stories of the characters but also provide profound insight into the history of the GDR and the reunification process with West Germany. After the end of the GDR and therefore the DEFA, Junge continued the "Golzow-Project" with the ARD and its regional affiliate RBB.
Idea.
The idea for the project derives from Karl Gass.
Segments.
This is a list of the installments of the "Children of Golzow" until 2007. The titles are in the German language, translation into English in brackets.

List of Gun Sword characters

This is a list of the fictional characters, with biographical details, in the Japanese anime Gun Sword (full name Gun x Sword, the "x" is silent) the story of which takes place on the fictional "Planet of Endless Illusion".
Protagonists.
Van.
Van is the primary protagonist of the series. He is traveling the world, searching after a mysterious man with an artificial claw hand who killed his bride, Helena, on the day of their wedding. Van swore to kill this man to avenge Helena. 
His primary weapon is a shape-memory cloth held at his side like a pistol. When an electrical charge is run through the weapon, it can change configuration to a dueling sword or extend to grapple or embed itself into walls. Van can also spin it in place from its hilt at high speed to act as an efficient shield against projectiles. 
Through his travels he has been given several titles, including: "Van the Unemployed", "Van the Freeloader", "Hangover Van", "Steel Van", "Invincible Van", "Pretty Boy Van from the Garbage Dump", "Van the Unsung Hero who Gives It All He's Got", "Van of the Dawn" (his favorite), "Daybreak Van", "Nice Guy Van", "Van that Weird Guy who Helped Out", "Van of a Thousand Conquests", "Van of a Thousand Naps" (according to Joshua), "Van, The Devil in The Poisoned Tuxedo", and "Van the Devil's Swallowtail Suit". Although laconic and calm of nature, whenever information about the Claw's whereabouts are mentioned, he quickly shifts to extreme anger. 
His white Armor, Dann of Thursday, or simply Dann, is held in place over the planet in a crucifix-shaped satellite, and is launched to his position when he twists his hat 180 degrees, holes varying in size form on his sword and then swings a 'V' with his sword in the air. It is one of the strongest armors on the planet, and uses a sword as its primary weapon. Due to Van's position as one of the "Original Seven" he needs to enter his armor once a week to regenerate. If he does not, he will fall ill and eventually die. In addition, Dann's regenerative abilities grant Van immortality as long as he rides periodically.
Van tries his best to remain uninvolved with those he meets along his way, and if he does help them, he does so out of public sight. He has an extremely low tolerance for alcohol, and drinks milk instead. When dining, he asks for all the available seasonings or all the condiments.
Although unexplained at first, he also possesses an unusual scar on his stomach; a circle split vertically down the center with seven lines radiating from the outside.
Van has a habit of forgetting the names of those he meets on his travels, especially Carmen, much to her chagrin. It wasn't until later that he begins to remember consistently. The first whose name he begins to remember is Wendy. The only person's name whom he does remember right away is Priscilla because she is a strong opponent which Van considers to be almost on the same level as him. 
He suddenly disappears without saying goodbye, and doesn't show up until a few years later, unwittingly meeting Wendy at her home.
Wendy Garret.
Wendy is Van's first traveling companion and joins him to find her brother Michael Garret who had been kidnapped by the Claw. Wendy is kind, compassionate, and determined and often wishes to assist those in need of help that they meet during their travel, in contrast to Van's policy of leaving everybody to him/herself. Around her neck is a pink tortoise, Kameo, that serves as a good luck charm, given to her by her brother. In the first episode it does so by stopping an incoming bullet meant for her, which leaves it with a dent in its shell.
Wendy grew up in a town called Evergreen with her brother, whom she deeply cares for as he protected her from danger in her early childhood days. She carries her brother's gun which she retrieved after his kidnapping. The gun contains only one bullet, and Wendy does not use it until the final episode of the anime, ironically to shoot her brother. 
A point constantly made in the series is Wendy's coming of age. She is often irritated when people put her aside as a child and she has attempted various times to be more adult-like in Van's presence from when he dismissed her as a brat in the first episode to go back to her town, and Wendy tells him to stop treating her as a child because she was ready to be his wife at anytime. With each progression in the story, she begins to be more ladylike as she learns more about the world. When she finally finds her brother, she decides to continue journeying with Van to find out what is right or wrong and what is true happiness, especially when she finds that she cannot deny that the world the Claw envisioned was attractive to her. She eventually follows Yukiko in trying to help the others despite not being able to fight. Also, Wendy grows to refute Van's statements at times, standing for her beliefs instead of subsiding. At the end, before Van departs, he remarks to her about how she'd grown since the first time he'd seen her in Evergreen.
Her relationship with Van is another aspect as it presented her with a revenge-driven drifter who still managed to be kind. She goes to extensive lengths to take care of him and it has been hinted quite constantly that she has feelings for him. Wendy refers to Van as her hero in the beginning, but sheds that title from him as she learns more about him, growing closer and seeing him with his flaws and his hidden side; she refers to this part of him with a memory of 'how very sweet and precious he looked when he was like that' (Episode 16 preview).
Carmen 99.
Carmen 99 (real name, Carol Mendosa) is a bright and self-sufficient intelligence agent/mercenary who Van and Wendy encounter in the second episode of the anime, although Van apparently has met her before. The nickname 'Carmen 99', comes both from her bust measurement (99 cm) and the number of hidden accessories she always carries. She is often looking for more ways to earn money.
Carmen grew up in the town of Trinolia with her uncle and his daughter (having lost her parents), both of whom she shared a close friendship with until she left the town. Throughout the series, Carmen frequently leaves Van and Wendy's company to later reunite with them, until she finally joins forces with them at the final stand to save the planet. 
In the second to the last episode, she infiltrates the Claw's headquarters along with Yukiko, planting bombs along the way. Carmen winds up in a room filled with the flowers that devastated her hometown, where she confronts Fasalina, her nemesis, for the last time. While they fight, Carmen admits to being jealous of Fasalina's directness, freedom and innocent appearance, but declares that she would rather die than become like her. When the Claw dies, Fasalina begs Carmen to kill her. At first, Carmen is more than happy to do so, but when she finds Michael Garret running towards Fasalina, she spares both of them. 
In the end, she also admits to liking Van very much after he finally remembers her name, though she laughs it off, knowing that it wouldn't work between them.
Ray Lundgren.
Ray is a withdrawn and ruthless Armor pilot whose wife, Shino, was killed by the Man with the claw hand. He first appears in episode 4 at the last minute, making his main appearance in episode 5 but is opposed at first to Van. Like Van, he travels to find the Man with the claw hand and exact his revenge by killing him. Unlike Van he has far fewer qualms over who dies by interfering with him, something Van despises and is easily provoked by. However, according to Joshua, he apparently was completely different in behavior prior to his wife's death. Later in the series he reveals that he seeks to kill the Claw and then die too in order to meet Yoshimo again. Like Van, he also abstains from alcohol, drinking water instead, though drinks it in a sake cup. 
Near the end of the series his eyes are injured and his vision is blurred. His vision remains blurred until he is killed on episode 24 while he tries to kill the Claw Man, his gunshots becoming more erratic with his deteriorating vision. His final shot temporarily derails the Claw's plans by lodging itself in the timer used by the Claw Man to activate his plan. He is then killed by security vehicles and falls down the steps. He is seen in his last scene in a sort of dream sequence where Shino is still alive and he remarks on the 'strange dream' he had before being reunited with her.
His rivalry with Van stems from the fact that both of them want to kill the Claw. Later in the series, they work together, although they show little concern for each other, even when engaged in combat with enemies.
Ray's primary weapon is a katana-shaped gun with a large magazine where the blade would be. He holds it just ahead of the hilt and spins a disc on the chamber to fire streams of bullets. He has several hidden weapons, such as the heels of his shoes. One acts as a very small hand held gun, while the other provides a way of summoning, remote-controlling, and self-destructing Volkan.
In many ways he is both very similar and opposite to Van. They both use Armors their wives worked on, completely dedicated to kill the Claw because he killed their wives, and are weak to alcohol. Where they are opposite is where Van wears a more western style, Ray wears more of a samurai style, Van uses a sword that looks like a gun, and Ray uses a gun that looks like a sword, Van focuses more on close combat where Ray fights with long distance, and finally Van summons his Armor from the sky where Ray summons his from the ground.
Last words: "Thank you...Josh."
Joshua Lundgren.
Joshua is Ray's brother and is talkative, upbeat and sociable. Though he deeply cares for Ray, he is entirely different in behavior than his older brother. Joshua claims his brother changed to his present behavior after his wife, Shino, died at the hands of the Claw, and although he also loved Shino, he wishes for Ray to accept her death and return home instead of exacting his revenge on her killer. Joshua has great technical skills, being able to repair numerous everyday items, analyze armor weaknesses, and even set up timed explosives. Joshua is somewhat dense when it concerns females, however, since he just walks in on Priscilla when she was taking a shower, and entered a women's restroom to find Wendy in a train station.
When he and Wendy first meet, they instantly get along, probably because they share so much in common. However, Van finds Joshua very annoying, and when Joshua is hospitalized after being injured when Ray confronts the Claw for the first time in the series, Van leaves Joshua behind. however, Joshua manages to catch up with help from Carmen 99, and they rejoin Van and Wendy for the final showdown. 
When Ray is killed, Joshua rushes to his aid, only to find himself captured by the Claw. However, before Yukiko can bust him out, he has already escaped, vowing to put a stop to the plan his older brother managed to stall before dying, and saves Yukiko as well. He is instrumental in the final battle as he succeeds in cutting power to Birthday thereby halting the Claw's plans.
The El Dorado Five.
Nero 
Josè 
Carlos 
Barrio 
The Eldorado Five consist of four aging but boisterous Armor pilots, Nero, Josè, Carlos, and Barrio. They spend their days reminiscing about past battles, which annoys the rest of their town to no end (because they believe they are making it all up for attention), fueled by their great liking for alcohol. The fifth member, Chizuru, has already passed away. Each of their animal-themed Armors can unite into a one gigantic mecha (Legs, Torso, Head and Shoulders, Arms, Backpack) called El Dorado Five, which possess great strength and power. The inn they frequently visit is managed by Yukiko, Chizuru's granddaughter.
Van and Wendy first meet them in their home town boasting about their deeds as armor pilots. When the town is attacked by a scientist who feels himself neglected by the town community, they arrive on the scene, but are incomplete since only four of the armors are connected together. Van remedies this, after a scathing comment, by taking Chizuru's Armor and hurling it at their armor where it connects and finally unites it into the "El Dora Five" for the first time in many years and defeat the villain. After this incident, their respect in the eyes of the town youngsters rises considerably. Later they also join Van's company to defeat the Claw and save the world, claiming that not many people get the opportunity to do so. After they help Van and Dann blast off into space to regenerate, they claim that Van is their "student" and that they would name him El Dora Dann. 
A comic trait is that Carlos is nearly always asleep, even when the group is engaged in the most ferocious battles. He does, however, wake up occasionally, and provides good advice when he does. During the final battle, their Armor is seriously damaged and the power fails. Carlos then wakes up completely, as the others admit defeat, and activates a backup power system before leading the last attack on Birthday's defenses, and helping Van get the finishing blow.
Their "secret base", stereotypical speech, distinct characteristics (Nero as the hot-blooded main pilot; Jose as the cool rival and foil to Nero; Barrio as the 'big guy'; Carlos possibly as the pint-sized genius technician; and Yukiko as the token girl) uniting mecha and colorful costumes are a loving homage of super robot and Super Sentai team shows. Their final form is an homage to GaoGaiGar.
When they defeat an enemy, they turn their back on their opponent, pose, and yell out "ADIOS, AMIGO!!!"
Priscilla.
Priscilla is a pink-haired girl who met Van for the first time in an Armor battle tournament. She loves to pilot her Armor and gives all the prize money she wins to the efforts of her sister, Johanna, in raising orphans. Both were raised by a former Armor pilot-turned-nun who was the original owner of Brownie, Priscilla's Armor. She controls her armor through a control interface system implanted in her lower spine, which allows her movements to be directly mimicked by her Armor, thus taking advantage of her athletic abilities. Priscilla is a firm believer in fair play, and refused a big company's bribe to throw a championship fight. Her personality is somewhat naive and is almost always cheerful. She later joins Van's company and also gains a crush on him, much to Wendy's chagrin. She is not afraid to show her feelings for Van. The El Dorado Five even once enthusiastically encouraged her to propose a marriage to him, seeing her strong feelings. Priscilla settled on a first date instead, since it was too soon to be considering marriage. In the end, her date is postponed when Van suddenly departs after fulfilling his mission to kill the Claw and avenge his wife. Priscilla vows to one day find him and have that date.
Another thing which seems to irritate Wendy (and Carmen), is that Van managed to remember Priscilla's name almost right away after their first meeting, while he didn't manage to remember Carmen's name before the very last episode. 
Yukiko Steavens.
Yukiko is the owner of the inn "Pink Amigo" in the El Dorado Five's hometown. She is the granddaughter of the late Chizuru Steavens, one of the members of the El Dorado Five. Yukiko has a soft spot for the remaining members and the sound of her beautiful voice always calms them down when they are about to create a ruckus. 
When the El Dorado Five join Van's company to save the world, she decides to go as well to care for the aging group. She acts as the cook during that period of time. 
In the last two episodes, she accompanies Carmen 99 as they infiltrate the Clawed Man's headquarters to find Joshua after he was imprisoned. She was almost captured herself, but was saved by Joshua, who had already escaped. Toting a stolen rifle, Yukiko then guards him as he hacks into the system and cuts the power, and also provides him with moral support when he reminisces about Ray.
Antagonists.
The Claw.
The Claw, whose real name is never revealed, is a mastermind with a prosthetic claw for a right hand and is the primary antagonist of the series. He killed both Van's and Ray's wives, and is the subject of their furious lust for revenge. Before episode 12, he is only shown in flashbacks as a shadowy figure with a claw in place of his right hand. In episode 12 however, Wendy runs into a kind old man who helps her in overcoming her sorrow for her brother. Immediately after the conversation, it is revealed that this man is the Claw the group had been looking for when Fasalina delivers his claw prosthetic to him, replacing the ordinary-looking hand he had attached beforehand.
It has been confirmed that the Claw killed the Original Seven pilots and replaced them with his own. It is known, however, that he did assassinate individuals with the potential knowledge and abilities to stop him. Helena and Shino, Van and Ray's wives respectively, were two such victims. 
Later in the series, it is revealed he plans to create a new world which supposedly will bring happiness to all people and eradicate all sins one has committed during life, regardless of whether the people want it or not, and totally ignoring those who were already happy to begin with. His plan apparently is to change the world by dissolving himself and then combining with everyone and everything on the planet on a subconscious level, perhaps acting as a sort of conscience for people. It is never made clear what exactly would happen to civilization or to himself, nor how the process would occur. It was described by Wendy as 'mental terrorism'.
Near the end of the series, it is revealed the planet's moon, as controlled by Birthday, could be used as a terraformer. The Claw Man hints that he intends to terraform the Endless Illusion into the perfect world he dreams of. It is implied that the entire population of the planet will be killed during the process and will be reborn in the new world. It is unclear whether this rebirth is possible as the Claw is very clearly insane.
The plan was also violently opposed by some of his crew members, claiming he was planning on committing genocide. In one of the episodes they attempt to commit a coup against him in order to force him into revealing the details for his plans. During the negotiations, the Claw seems to strongly prefer talk instead of violence, insisting that genocide is not part of his plans. This pacifism and goodwill is debatable, as minutes later, he kills one of the rebels by hugging him (apparently of love) while slashing his back with the claw. When he relinquishes him and discovers he is dead, he breaks into shock, saying "I did it again", and repeatedly apologizing, as if unaware of his embrace being lethal for the rebel. He also shows very little sadness and is somewhat indifferent whenever one of the Original Seven is killed by Van or Ray, maintaining that as long as he has the DNA samples of each pilot, his plan will succeed.
To realize his plans, he gathers a society of loyal and devoted followers (including Wendy's brother Michael and Van's mentor Gadved), six of whom are pilots of the Original Seven save Dann of Thursday. Within this society he is only known as "The Comrade".
He wears simple clothes most of the time, despite being the leader. In the final episodes however he replaced this with a white outfit with a chain which leads from his collar down. This is later seen to be the standard uniform of the scientists when Michael sees their remains, all of them wearing the same sort of clothing. He also is shown to like gardening, and the company of animals. In general, he is shown to engage in creative and nurturing activities. Though he appears to be a kind and somewhat absent-minded old man, the Claw is actually very insane and does not admit to any kind of wrongdoing, despite the fact that nearly all of his actions have caused death and misery to innocents. He always rationalizes his acts as being ultimately for the good of mankind. Another driving force to his insanity is due to his impending death, probably brought about by an illness. 
It was revealed later in Episode 23 that the Claw managed to escape the Mother Planet 'Earth' along with a collection of other people. Apparently, they loved each other at first, but then they began killing each other leaving only the Claw left. This is what inspired him to "make the world a peaceful place with my own hands".
A little known fact is that the world known as the "Endless Illusion" was once a prison planet with the Original Seven Armors acting as 'wardens.' The Comrade had been present during the planet's fall and evolution into its present state. Not wanting to see more misery and pain to the world, he decided to become the population's 'conscience,' and embarks on a plan to assimilate himself into everyone's sub-conscious. 
His plan is halted before its completion when Van and his allies stop the process and the Claw meets his end as Van cuts him in half with his sword. During the final battle, the Claw shows the scope of his insanity by saying things like 'Amazing! I have so many new friends!' and finally 'Van... I really like you' before Van slices him in half.
Super Robot Wars K has confirmed The Claw Man's real name to be Koo Krying Kroo (クー・クライング・クルー), William Woo's father.
Michael Garret.
Michael Garret is Wendy Garret's older brother and was her only remaining family member in Evergreen after her parents died. When they were younger, he cared very much for her, protecting her when their town of Evergreen was assaulted by bandits. He is later kidnapped by the Claw, and Wendy joins Van in order to rescue him. However, when she finally finds him, it proves out he no longer is kept with the Claw against his will. He reveals that he has joined forces with him in order to realize the Claw's dream of eradicating all sorrow on the planet by creating a new world. 
Like his sister, he is usually kind and compassionate, but can be fiercely independent when he wants to. Although he has freely joined the Claw, he still has his doubts and struggles to rid himself of his suspicious feelings against the project he has joined, especially when a mutinous group attempts to rebel and they try to get Michael to join them. But in the end, he chooses to stay with the Claw and Fasalina, with whom he ends up sharing a deep bond. 
Michael is one of the only member of The Original Seven along with Woo who is able to control an "Original Armor" without needing surgical implants embedded into his body. This is the main reason why the Claw chose him, and Michael later proves out to be a vital part of the Claw's plan. 
He pilots the Original Seven Armor Saudade of Sunday, which was launched into space and destroyed two of the Original Seven satellites. There, he encounters Van and the two of them battle, with Van constantly reminding Michael about Wendy. Whether this is a diversion tactic or Van genuinely cares very much about Wendy, it enrages Michael and he blames Van in turn for making Wendy leave Evergreen. Their fight is interrupted by an explosion brought about by the moon and the liquid-state material surrounding it, but continues when they return to the Planet of Endless Illusion, where Van also continues to scold and taunt Michael for not being a good brother. In the end, Michael is defeated and Saudade destroyed.
In the penultimate episode, he and Wendy meet again, and when he tells her to step aside as he still has to complete his mission, she points his own gun towards him, answering that he's not the only one with a mission to complete. She ultimately shoots him in the arm when he keeps on going, using up the last bullet in the gun. Wendy begins to explain the negative effects of the Claw's plan, which only makes Michael even angrier. He then tries to strangle her out of rage, but Wendy is saved by Kameo biting Michael's hand. Even so, he still saves her from being crushed by falling debris, and the two siblings come to an understanding and part ways, with Michael leaving his gun with Wendy and advising her to follow her own path, while he follows his. He and his lover Fasalina seemingly perish after a boulder falls on top of them, though this is not confirmed. 
Armor: Saudade of Sunday resembles an energy handgun
Fasalina.
Fasalina is extremely loyal to the Claw and is his right-hand woman, and will do anything to protect both him and his dream. Before being recruited, she worked as a prostitute, and is eternally grateful for being offered the opportunity to work for the Claw. When battling in her Armor, Fasalina often taunts her opponents by being very flirtatious, thereby bringing them out of focus. She also pole dances with her staff to control her Armor. She later develops a romantic relationship with Michael and becomes a faithful supporter of him.
When not fighting inside her armor, she uses a staff which can extend, bend or contract at her will. Carmen 99 develops a glowing animosity against Fasalina later in the series, for Fasalina corrupted Carmen's hometown with poisonous flowers and was indirectly responsible for the death of the latter's best friend. When the Claw is killed by Van, and the former prostitute is defeated by Carmen in their own final showdown, Fasalina begs for Carmen to kill her, after losing all of her will to live. She is later reunited with Michael only to seemingly perish with him when a boulder lands on top of them. Whether or not they had survived is in question, since they are never seen afterward.
Armor: Dahlia of Wednesday resembles a staff
Gadved.
Gadved was once a good friend of Van and Helena, as both Helena and Gadved worked researching the Original Seven armors. On the tragic wedding day when Van and Helena was critically injured by the Claw, a dying Helena asked Gadved to permanently make Van ""Dann of Thursday""'s pilot, thereby making him a member of the Original Seven. In the series, Van discovers to his enormous shock that Gadved has become one of the Claw's followers. He also reveals that he was the one who told the Claw where to find Van's wife. He is a veteran Armor pilot and the last surviving member of the former generation of Original Seven pilots which he says had become corrupted, especially after the fall of the Mother Planet Earth. He is the first of the pilots to be killed by Van after they both agree to share the same dream, and the outcome of their battle was to prove who had the better conviction. In end, Van won out. Gadved, like most Original Seven Armor riders, possesses a memory-cloth weapon, in his case one shaped like an axe.
Armor: Diablo of Monday resembles an axe.
Carossa.
Carossa is a member of the Claw's society and twin brother of Melissa, though far more aggressive and rash than her. Whenever they are together it is always he who takes the initiative. Both he and Melissa were orphans and as such he has developed a deep need for attention, especially from the Claw. He is also very protective of his sister and will attack anyone who scares her or makes her cry. Nearly from the beginning, he develops a growing sense of animosity of Michael, partly because he becomes the center of the Claw's attention (due to his importance in his plan) and partly because Melissa develops a crush on him. Both siblings are members of the Original Seven and appear to be the result of research using a mental link between twins. Ray mercilessly kills both of them with his rifle during their attempt to delay the protagonists' approach to the Claw.
Armor: Sin of Friday resembles a tonfa.
Melissa.
Melissa is Carossa's twin sister. She is easily frightened but is far more reasonable and cautious than her brother. She later gains a crush on Michael, much to Carossa's chagrin. When in armor battle, she and Carossa operate in sync, allowing them to seamlessly combine into one armor for greater strength and defense. The two are also the final product of twin genome project in the wind valley city.
Armor: Sen of Saturday resembling a chakram
Woo.
Woo (full name, William Will Woo) is a member of the Original Seven and heir to a noble family. He appears cold and collected on the outside, but is filled with rage and turmoil on the inside. Woo suffers from an Oedipus complex. He regarded his father as an adversary and competitor for the exclusive love of his mother. When Woo was an adolescent, he attacked his father with a knife in an attempt to kill him, but his mother jumped in the way and was killed. After that, Woo left the township his family had governed due to the painful memories, and left it to succumb to decay. However he says he returned to this place to intercept Van, and that this proved he had finally succeeded. Woo had become increasingly mentally unstable since then and seeks to unleash his pent-up rage in any way he can. He also calls Van and Gadved 'old types'. Van kills him after luring him towards Dann on top of his castle and they clash in a fight of wills where it is revealed that Woo 'abandoned his mother for his father's sake' (This, along with silhouettes of his parents shown in flashbacks, suggest that his father was the Claw). Van then challenges this by saying that no one who abandons their true love can defeat him.
In Super Robot Wars K, it is confirmed that the Claw was indeed his father.
Armor: Metsä of Tuesday resembles a fencing sword.
The Original Seven.
"Armor" is the term used in the series to refer to any kind of giant, pilotable mecha, typically designed for combat purposes. Armor pilots are known as "Armor riders." 
Among the wide variety of Armors, there are seven unique units that are far more powerful than others, known as "The Original Seven Armors." They are named after the seven days of the week and are piloted by people who are picked out for the task for each generation, known as "The Original Seven". Many of these riders are given special implants in order to be able to control their Armor, but some of them are born with this ability and are considered more important. The Original Seven Armors also differ from ordinary Armors because they are contained in crucifix-shaped satellites in space when they are not in use, one station for each of the Armors. Here, they are refueled and repaired and can be summoned down to their owner at their leisure. When the Armor is summoned, it takes the shape of a giant version of a certain weapon, typically the Armor and its rider's weapon of choice, but in battle they change into a humanoid form. All Original Seven units have a blue-black liquid called G.E.R. fluid that permeates the entire armor. It runs through the body of the mecha like blood, seeping out of any wounds that the armor sustains in combat. It also fills the cockpit, able to accept neural inputs and impart healing abilities to the pilot's injuries when they are connected. The normally blue-black flow of G.E.R. fluid in the cockpit becomes a bright, iridescent white if a pilot is especially in tune with his or her Armor.
Gadved eventually reveals to Van that originally the Original Seven were the guardians of the Endless Illusion, a planet "at the very bottom of the universe", used as a prison by "Mother" Earth. However they became corrupt over the coming generations and ignored their duties. With the destruction of Mother Earth, this became more extreme. Gadved also states that Van's ability to access Dann's pilot healing feature is the reason Dann of Thursday was the "strongest armor" in existence. Whether this includes Saudade of Sunday and Birthday, which were not active at the time, is not clear. It is also not clear if all of the Original Seven could heal their pilots or if said pilots could access this ability successfully. Gadved is the only remaining member from the previous generation, the others, according to him, were killed by the Claw so his own pilots could be used as part of his plan.
Saudade of Sunday.
Pilot: Michael Garret
Saudade of Sunday was retrieved from the sunken ruins of a city in episode 10, therefore, it is the only Original Seven armor without a satellite station. It is hinted that this was because being an experimental or stronger Armor; they could not control its power and its satellite station ended up underwater because of it. When it is in its compact form it has the appearance of a gigantic gun. In humanoid form, it sprouts several large wings which functions as large solar panels, thus allowing Saudade to function without continuous refueling unlike the other Original Seven Armors. Saudade wields a large sword with a gun at the hilt which fires energy beams. 
Saudade is later launched into space and to the moon as part of the Claw's scheme, but calculations showed that there was a 20% chance of it colliding with Dann of Thursday's base, and the satellite was destroyed because of it. Later, Saudade also destroyed Diablo of Monday's satellite station when it was reentering the planet after Dann used it to recharge. A battle between the two armors ensues, interrupted by an explosion brought about by the Claw's plan. 
Saudade was the first to reenter the Endless Illusion's atmosphere in episode 24 in pretty good condition. It launches into another attack against Dann when the latter returns and threatens the Birthday and the Claw. In the second and final confrontation, Dann of Thursday slashes a V into Saudade and destroys it, much to Michael's disbelief, since Saudade of Sunday was supposed to be the most advanced of the Original Seven Armors. Saudade, along with Sen of Saturday, possesses gold armor instead of the typical grey-white of most of the other Original Seven.
Diablo of Monday.
Pilot: Gadved
In appearance, Diablo is a bulkier version of Van's Armor, Dann of Thursday, and appears in episode 12, where Gadved fought Van. It appears to be slightly stronger than Van's armor, although it is unknown if this due to Gadveds longer experience in piloting or the Diablo itself.
In its compact form it resembles a giant axe and it therefore wields a halberd in its humanoid form. It was defeated by Dann of Thursday with Van's greater drive and conviction. Later near to the end of the series Dann of Thursday used Diablo's satellite to repair itself after Saudade of Sunday destroyed Dann's storage satellite while on its way to the Moon. Diablo's satellite station was destroyed when Saudade of Sunday was reentering the planet's surface.
Metsä of Tuesday.
Pilot: Woo
Metsä is a slender armor which first appears in episode 15, where it does battle with Van and his armor Dann. In its compact form, Metsä takes the shape of an enormous lance, wielding a rapier in humanoid form.
During the first battle, Dann is no match against Metsä due to Van's inexperience in using the mech's electromagnetic shield and other capabilities. Van then descends into a sort of depressing mood playing endlessly with a rotating puzzle Gadved had given him to prepare him for piloting the Original Seven. He finally solves it by thinking of Helena and her love (more accurately, it was solved by emptying his mind of all thought of the puzzle itself, essentially making the puzzle a part of his body in his mind). By using the puzzle's solution in piloting Dann, Van unlocked the complete abilities of the Armor. This makes the rematch take a complete reversal. In the rematch, it is more will than strength which proves the outcome as both of them challenge each other about their 'loves'. Van pushes Metsä down through Will's 'sanctuary' and it falls onto its back, with its own lance striking the middle. This causes it to explode.
Metsä means "forest" in Finnish.
Dahlia of Wednesday.
Pilot: Fasalina
Dahlia is Fasalina's unique Armor which she reveals in episode 20. In its compact form it is shaped as a three-part staff and accordingly wields a similar weapon in humanoid form. Dahlia is very agile and has speed to match, despite its appearance. Fasalina controls it by swinging around a pole installed in the cockpit of the armor (referring to her life as a prostitute before joining the Claw), which is also her staff. 
Dahlia possesses some unconventional weapons as it can fire a burst of its own G.E.R. fluid against the enemy Armor, effectively binding them since the liquid solidifies on contact. Another unique weapon is its ability to create tendrils of G.E.R. fluid from its chest for close range combat. It can also fire rocket missiles for long range combat, and even use camouflage to evade or surprise an enemy, as Dahlia looks very much like a large flower. 
During its fight with Dann of Thursday, it was almost destroyed until it was kicked out of the way by the El Dorado Five. However during its second fight, Ray and Vulcan destroy her mech's arm and body with Vulcan's guns at point-blank range, thereby crippling Dahlia forever. Dahlia is one of three Original Seven Armors with a unique coloration, the armor on its body being a shade of pink.
Dann of Thursday.
Pilot: Van
Dann is Van's armor, built along the same lanky proportions as Van himself. In compact form it resembles a giant sword and thus wields a huge sword in humanoid form, from which a smaller knife can be separated. A giant blade is mounted on its back, and can provide limited flight capabilities similar to rocket propulsion. Dann is one of the few Armors which possesses no long range attacks, and it depends entirely on Van's movements and swordsmanship in order to inflict damage on its opponents. In the beginning of the series, Van has not learned to activate all of Dann's power yet, but by the last episode he has discovered how to utilize Dann's electromagnetic shield, which greatly improves Dann's odds against a long range-attacking opponent. Later towards the end of the series Dann's satellite station was shot down by Saudade of Sunday during its rocket to the moon because of the chances Saudade might have collided with the satellite station, therefore stopping Dann from repairing itself after its battle with Dahlia of Wednesday. Dann later repairs itself using Diablo of Monday's satellite station which is later destroyed by Saudade of Sunday. In the end, Dann is stored in another of the remaining satellites, though is not mentioned which one.
Most unusual is its ability to instantly heal injuries or illnesses that Van has, including hangovers, once he enters the cockpit. Furthermore, it also has an Overdrive ability which can emit a highly devastating beam of supercharged G.E.R. fluid which cuts like a giant sword, although its hinted that this ability is Van's and not Dann's. Van, as a result of a special surgery, is symbiotically linked with Dann and is required to interface with the Armor at least once per week. If he does not, he will eventually fall ill as if with a bad fever and die. Accordingly, if either Van dies or Dann is destroyed, the other will cease to exist.
Sin of Friday.
Pilot: Carossa
Sin, along with its sister armor Sen, differs from the other Original Seven because it has a nonhumanoid structure. In its compact form it is in the shape of a tonfa, while in its battle state, it is hunched backwards with large hind legs and a tail. When battling it wields a tonfa which can morph into different weapons. Sin and Sen can combine into a single Armor to increase their attack and defense, but can just as easily separate again. It can also fire energy beams and is protected by an electromagnetic shield. It is destroyed along with its pilot by Vulcan's beam howitzer.
Sen of Saturday.
Pilot: Melissa
Sen is Sin's sister armor, but smaller. In its battle state it is more humanoid than its sibling but the head is very alien looking. In its compact form it resembles a chakram, which is also its weapon when in battle form. The chakram is a deadly ring which can be thrown against an enemy and pierce its armor and will return to its owner like a boomerang. Sen can interlock with Sin to a single armor, where Sen resides in the interior and bottom section, protected by the stronger and bigger Sin. Like Sin, it can fire energy beams and is protected by an electromagnetic shield. It is destroyed by Vulcan's beam howitzer. Sen is one of three Original Seven Armors with a unique armor color, possessing the same pale gold as Saudade of Sunday.
Other armors.
Vulcan.
Vulcan, (pronounced "Volkein") is Ray's Armor and was built by his late wife Shino, who was killed by the Claw. It is armed with a long-range rifle, a strong handgun that is fired by connecting a pressurized hose to the Armor's power source, a gatling gun, and missiles from its back. In contrast to Van's armor, Ray summons Vulcan by repeatedly firing his gun downwards into the ground to trace out a circle around himself, signaling where it will rise from underground encased within a transport. The shell also serves to protect him while shooting his rifle long-range. Vulcan also has an extremely powerful beam howitzer capable of punching through an Original Seven's electromagnetic shields, but it has one major setback; it takes a long time to charge. Ray has also equipped Vulcan with a special energy dissipating cloak which absorbs energy blasts, giving him a huge advantage against other armors using energy weaponry. When not in combat it moves in a large drilling vehicle which can burst up from the ground wherever Ray summons it. It also includes a self-destruct feature which Ray can activate with one of his shoes.
It is later revealed that Vulcan served as an inspiration for the construction of beam weapons on five of the Original Seven Armors (excluding Dann and Saudade, both not in the Claw's possession at the time), since Shino worked with the people that designed the Original Seven, though was not present when they were being constructed and upgraded. The weapons were actually recent additions, only being added after the Claw recruited the Original Seven for his own purposes.
Metal Glow.
The armor appeared in episode 2, and resembled a battleship with a vast humanoid torso attached. Metal Glow was commanded by Baron Mayor of the bridge city in order to conquer the world. Its main attacks were the use of its gigantic arms and the Regulus Cannon, a turret that sprayed molten metal over its opponents. Van managed to destroy Metal Glow by throwing Dann's sword through into the regulus cannon then used his foot to push on it sending the sword through the center and back out the other side.
El Dorado.
El Dorado is an older Armor piloted by the El Dorado Five. When the series start, they have not used it for many years, but they finally use it when the safety of their hometown is threatened. El Dorado is composed of five separate smaller mechas which combine into one Armor, known as "El Dora Five", though they can combine without the support backpack to create the weaker "El Dora Four". In order for it to activate its most powerful mode, all five must be interlocked. The armor mostly relies on hand-to-hand combat but is also capable of missile attacks and launching powerful special moves. El Dorado depletes its energy fast and therefore does not last long in prolonged battle without Chizuru's "support unit". Later in the series El Dorado is upgraded into the El Dora Soul, gaining power but losing its ability to separate.
In the final showdown, the El Dorado Five helps Priscilla and Brownie take down the incoming One-on-Ones, armors at the Clawed Man's disposal. Near the end, El Dora Soul hurls Dann of Thursday like a javelin towards the Birthday after the shield around it was deactivated, so that Dann could finish off the Birthday.
El Dora Five (and by extension El Dora Soul) carries a striking resemblance to GaoGaiGar and Dancouga. Its final attack is a homage of GaoGaiGar's Hell and Heaven attack.
Brownie.
Brownie is Priscilla's rabbit-themed Armor, first shown in episode 14 when Van is to face Priscilla in a battle tournament. At first, Brownie is only equipped with a large electrically charged spear. During the tournament, Priscilla's main strategy is to dodge her enemies' attacks (using her athletics) waiting for the right moment to attack the opponent's weak point with the spear in a final blow known as "The Pixie Stab". It can also create a strong wind current creating a dust storm in the arena, which Priscilla uses to hide.
In addition to the base unit, Priscilla installs a set of "heavy" armor on to Brownie for the tournament. The armor adds a pair of sharp blades to the knees that can be used in dashing slash attacks, but most importantly the equipment reduces Brownie's speed significantly. This is used to confuse opponents when they try to gauge the true speed and power of the armor. After Van manages to fend off Priscilla effectively, she removes Brownie's heavy armor and battles in her true form.
When Priscilla rejoins Van on the Claw's base, Brownie appears with several additional forms of weaponry. A long-range cabled spike, similar to the close range Fairy Stab, has been mounted on its right elbow. Also, Vulcan cannons were added to Brownie's shoulders to provide light ranged fire. The most unusual addition is seen when Priscilla fights one of the Claw's One-on-One automated armors: Brownie attacks by flying butt-first, shooting a tail-mounted gun-pod.
S-Drive Dragon.
First appeared in episode 8, the S-Drive Dragon resembles a metallic Chinese dragon. As well as being able to hover through the air, it used a powerful water-jet cutter from its mouth and a constricting attack to overcome any who tried to cross the mountains where it lay. The S-Drive designation referred to a set of solar panels on the spine of the dragon that would store energy from the sun. When the dragon was finally defeated, Van and Ray discover that the armor was unmanned; the Rider inside had died long ago.
Van's team is ambushed by a pair of automated Dragons when they attempt to pass through the underwater tunnel leading to the Claws's base. These two dragons are armed differently, as instead of using the hydro cutter of the first dragon they attack primarily with a pair of head mounted beam cannons. These two were dispatched by Brownie and El Dora Soul. 
Finally, a fourth Dragon armor is used by Zapiero Muttaaca's rebel force as they try to escape from the Claw. It also attacks using the twin beam cannons, as well as unleashing a missile barrage against Saudade of Sunday from multiple back-mounted launchers. Zapiero Muttaaca's Dragon was destroyed by Michael during this encounter.
Golden Cradle.
After Van sees through Joe's deception in episode 7, Joe summons Golden Cradle to do battle against Dann. Golden Cradle looks like a large medieval knight, with a massive cross-bearing shield and large lance as its primary armaments. Its face is half-covered by a golden helmet, the other half revealing a robotic skull face. Despite its heavily armored appearance, the Golden Cradle is reasonably agile and able to duel with Dann to some degree.
After slicing open Joe's outer cockpit, Van manages to severely wound the Golden Cradle by blinding Joe with a well-reflected beam of sunlight and slashing through the armor's shield in the confusion. Joe self-destructs Golden Cradle, depriving Van of any information regarding the Claw.
The Golden Cradle design is seen again when Van's team journeys to the Claw's secret base. Several automated green colored versions, called One-on-Ones, form the outer defense line of the Claw Man's facilities. The One-on-One version is armed with a set of shield-mounted machine guns in addition to its large melee lance. Their autopilot is seemingly crude and predictable, as Priscilla is able to anticipate its movements and destroy them handily.
The controls of this particular armor is different from most of the other ordinary armors, the pilot needs only to put his hands on the two orbs in the cockpit to control the armor, presumably using only thoughts.
Birthday (Big Brain).
The ultimate Armor designed by the people who escaped from Earth, the Mother Planet, which supposedly surpassed the Original Seven. It controlled the moon of the Endless Illusion, which was actually a giant satellite used to escape from Earth by a group of scientists. It is crucial to the Claw's plot, who pilots it himself and fights against Dann of Thursday several times. Inside it is just a large room full of golden fluid instead of the traditional blue with a pillar which the Claw Man only has to lie in to control. Its prime defense is the 'Guardian Curtain' which is a curtain made of energy surrounding it. This was destroyed by Brownie and El Dora Five continuously attacking it.
It is very strong, as demonstrated when it managed to almost crush Dann of Thursday with both hands, cracking the armor. It can also utilize the liquid system in the satellite to shoot streams of energy from orbit (This was later also copied by Dann who did something similar forming a sort of lance from the energy to attack with). It is immobile and appears like a gigantic smiling face with two large hands on the side. It also stores the countdown timer for the Claw's final plan (A huge upright combination lock type pillar with the reels turning, similar in design to the puzzle Van carries around). It was momentarily stopped by Ray's final shot which rebounded off the Claw's prosthetic hand and embeds itself between the reels effectively stopping the countdown at the last minute. 
In the end, with the help of the El Dorado Five and Joshua Lundgren (who hacked the system causing a power failure), Dann destroys the shield around Birthday before jumping up and slicing it cleanly in half.

Morgan Arboretum

The Morgan Arboretum is a forested reserve, situated on the McGill University Macdonald Campus in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue on the western tip of the island of Montreal, in Quebec, Canada. McGill University acquired the property in 1945, and through the work of Robert Watson and his son John Watson, the arboretum has remained a managed, mixed use area which is used for the purpose of conservation, academic study, recreation, and forestry management. It has also been an important recreational facility for the community. It is supported by both McGill and a charity, the Morgan Arboretum Association. There is an active members organisation, The Friends of the Morgan Arboretum which had 2000 members as of 2010. Visitors are welcomed and are charged a nominal $6.00 admission fee for adults.

Fisherman Island (Virginia)

Fisherman Island is the southernmost island on the Delmarva Peninsula chain of barrier islands. Located at the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay, the island is subject to great changes in its landscape from waves and runoff. It first formed about 200 to 250 years ago. 
Fisherman Island National Wildlife Refuge is located within the United States Fish and Wildlife Service's Eastern Shore of Virginia National Wildlife Refuge, and is cut in half by the presence of U.S. Highway 13 and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel. The refuge is closed to the public.
The island is the habitat to migratory waterfowl, shorebirds, and nesting waterbirds. In September 2003, the island was almost entirely flooded by Hurricane Isabel.
Fisherman Island and the Eastern Shore of Virginia National Wildlife Refuge have an official Facebook page at: Eastern Shore of VA and Fisherman Island NWR.

Santa Barbara Polo Club

Founded in 1911, the Santa Barbara Polo Club in Santa Barbara, California is the premiere equestrian Polo club in the Western United States. The club, located between the foothills of the Santa Ynez Mountains and the Pacific Ocean, consists of three full size outdoor polo fields, one arena, extensive horse boarding and exercise facilities, as well as stabling for 350 horses. The Santa Barbara Polo Club is home to the Pacific Coast Open, United States Polo Association (USPA) America Cup and the USPA Circuit Player's Cup.
History.
In 1911, the Santa Barbara Polo Club was declared an official polo club by the United States Polo Association. The club set about looking for a permanent home and found one through an $80,000 purchase of part of the property known as the Bartlett Estate on Middle Road in Montecito. The Bartlett Family took back an $80,000 loan for the property and the club raised $15,000 to build a concrete club house. They even went so far as to make the roof concrete so the members could watch the matches from on high. There were also two sets of concrete stairs to access the roof for members and waiters. The club and the fields lasted until 1928 when it was moved to its present location and the house was recently rebuilt and named Villa Polo.. During the 1920s such stars as Chaplin, Fairbanks and Will Rogers all competed here. Rogers broke his arm during a game and was quoted in the newspaper as saying,"They call this sport a gentlemans game for the same reason they call fat guys slim". The club was then erected in its present location thanks to Major Max Fleischmann. Between 1920 and 1930 the club grew in popularity and number of memberships. Horses and players arrived by train and walked to the club. World War II had adverse effects on the polo club. After a Japanese attack on Goleta, California (Attacks on North America during World War II), soldiers were stationed at the polo club to protect the members for the remaining years of the war. After a lull in polo play during the war, the Santa Barbara Club again gained momentum attracting many of the families that would eventually preserve the club. For the first time in 1963 and again in 1966, trials were held for positions on the American Polo Team for the Cup of the America's Tournament against Argentina. During the 1970s, the club was leased by Robert Skene, a 10 Goal player who would eventually become manager and is responsible for much of the club's success. In 1974, the Santa Barbara Development Company completed construction on a new polo complex at the Santa Barbara Club in which 144 condominiums were built. Kenneth Walker, Glen Holden and Dr. Norman Ringer, Trustees of the SBPC, purchased the polo ground as well as the club house a year after the complex was completed. The club then was leased to the Santa Barbara Polo Club Management Company, Inc. During the 1990s, the club is extended to intercollegiate and interscholastic play hosting the first official interscholastic tournament in the Western United States in 1995. In 1998, the Santa Barbara Polo Club hosted the most prestigious event in polo, the Federation of International Polo (FIP) World Championship. The Olympic style event (Polo was removed from Olympic competition in 1939 and is now governed by the FIP) recorded attendance of over 20,000 people. The SBPC has to date over 500 members, more than 100 of which are full-time polo players.
Polo School.
The Santa Barbara Polo Club is home to the Santa Barbara International Polo Training Center. The SBIPTC is a polo school for beginning players, taught by John Westley. The polo school teaches interscholastic, intercollegiate, and adult players.

Frederic E. Mohs

Frederic Edward Mohs (March 1, 1910 – July 2, 2002), a physician and general surgeon, developed the Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) technique in 1938 to remove skin cancer lesions while still a medical student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The Mohs procedure is considered the best method for treating certain types of skin cancer, especially of the head and neck, with cure rates approaching 100%.
Mohs was born in Burlington, Wisconsin. His father died when he was 3 months old, and the family moved to Madison, where his mother ran a boarding house. After initially considering a career as a radio engineer, he switched to medical studies in college. Mohs began developing his treatment in the 1930s, experimenting on rats, puppies, and other animals. The breakthrough came when he discovered that applying a combination zinc chloride and bloodroot paste to malignant rat skin tissue allowed it to be removed surgically and examined under a microscope. He treated his first human patient on June 23, 1936. Mohs, who spent his working life at the University of Wisconsin, was a tireless advocate for the surgical procedure he had devised and taught it to doctors from all over the world. 
In 1943 Mohs married Mary Ellen Reynolds, who died in 1995. Mohs died at his home in Madison, Wisconsin on July 2, 2002 at the age of 92. He is survived by two sons, Frederic and Thomas, of Madison; and a daughter, Jane Shimming of Jupiter, Fla.
Mohs first tried to publish his findings and encouraged surgeons to learn the procedure. This was largely unsuccessful, as many surgeons were not comfortable learning skin pathology and laboratory techniques. Dermatologists, who are well trained in dermatopathology, and who treat skin cancers on a daily basis, quickly embraced the procedure. Today, most Mohs procedures are performed by dermatologists, although a small number of plastic surgeons, otolaryngologists, and pathologists are also practicing and using the procedure as well.
Mohs' technique was later modified by Perry Robins in the 1970s, using fresh-tissue frozen histology. Rather than using the anesthetic Mohs paste, local anesthetic is used. The fresh skin specimen is then mounted on a cryostat, and frozen sections are examined instead of the Mohs paste-fixed sections. This method is now commonly referred to as Mohs surgery, and occasionally chemosurgery, in reference to the Mohs paste that Mohs initially used.

Napco Four Wheel Drive Vehicles

NAPCO (Northwestern Auto Parts Company) was founded in 1918 and based in Minneapolis. During World War II, NAPCO helped the war effort by producing specialized mechanical parts and assemblies that were tested in war conditions.
As early as 1942 NAPCO began building four-wheel drive assemblies to be fitted to Ford, GMC, Chevrolet and Studebaker vehicles however NAPCO is primarily associated with GMC and Chevrolet pickups. From 1942 to 1956 4×4 GMC and Chevrolet trucks could be ordered by the government and civilians with a NAPCO Power-Pak kit and the kit could be installed later. The retail price of Napco Power-Pak was $995. This option raised the price on a new two-wheel drive truck from $1,548.96 to $2,796.96. The kit was shipped in a crate measuring 80"x30"x26" weighing 1,410 pounds. In a matter of 3 hours with as little as 4 holes drilled in existing chassis a truck would be converted into a "Mountain Goat", a "full sized truck that will climb steep inclines with ease". One feature was the "shift on the fly" rubber mounted transfer case with a dual-range option. There were companies that installed these upgrades for the previously mentioned manufacturers. Besides the four-wheel drive units NAPCO also provided winches, auxiliary transmissions, tandem drive axles, hydrovac systems, and dump truck bodies.
From 1956 to 1959 the NAPCO Power-Pak option could be ordered directly from GM (an official RPO 690 was assigned in 1957) and factory installed on trucks with very few modifications to the original chassis. The 1955 4×4 NAPCO GMC or Chevrolet was a $1250.00 to $1550.00 optional add on. The 1957 Chevrolet and GMC 3100 4×4 price was a bargain at $2549.00 compared to the earlier add on kits. In 1960 NAPCO and GM parted ways when GM redesigned the front suspension on their 1960 pickup line so that it wasn't easily compatible with the existing Power-Pak kits.
Prior to 1955 NAPCO Power-Pak conversions were done on 3/4 and one ton GMC and Chevrolet chassis. The Pre-1955 ton chassis used an incompatible "torque tube" drive. In the fall of 1954 GMC and Chevrolet changed the 1955 ton pickup and Suburban models to the compatible Hotchkiss drive.
Today these trucks are still considered to be very versatile and durable 60 years later and are considered to be collectible by NAPCO enthusiasts.
Other early 4×4 manufacturers.
Early factory 4×4 pickup manufacturers and early 4×4 conversion kit manufacturers include;
Chrysler Motor Corporation's Dodge Trucks World War II Power Wagon.
Willys Overland along with Ford built the Willys MB Jeep working from designs by the American Bantam Car Company. After W.W.II Willys-Overland built the CJ series, and Willys Wagons among other early 4x4 vehicles.
Marmon-Herrington in Indianapolis. Marmon-Herrington is commonly associated with equipping 1940s and 1950s Ford pickup trucks with 4 wheel dive.

E-file.lu

e-file.lu is an electronic filing and communication platform in Luxembourg for secure transmission of data, documents and regulatory reports between financial institutions and Luxembourg authorities. It is broadly equivalent to the SEC’s EDGAR system in the USA or the FSA’s GABRIEL platform in the UK.
E-file was conceived and developed by Luxembourg Stock Exchange and Finesti in cooperation with the CSSF, Luxembourg’s financial regulatory authority.
Data transmission.
It allows both automatic and manual transmission of data.
The e-file platform permits the transmission of formatted documents as well as data flows in XBRL or XML format. This flexibility and the modular architecture make transmission independent from the types of data and documents.
Secure transmission.
E-file transmissions take place in a secure environment complying with the European and domestic regulatory requirements through data encryption, 1024/2048 bits SSL certificates and HTTPS connection.
Such secure transmission is used for mandatory transmission of regulatory bank reports to the Luxembourg Central Bank (BCL) and the CSSF.
Bank reporting.
E-file is also used for electronic bank reporting required under Basel II, IRFS and MiFID as well as for other legal and statistical reporting to the Luxembourg Central Bank (BCL) and the CSSF. Automated reports are transmitted in XBRL or XML format.
UCI reporting.
In September 2008 the Luxembourg’s financial regulatory authority CSSF issued a circular 08/371 resulting in the official adoption of the e-file platform for the mandatory transmission of UCI simplified and full prospectuses and annual and semi-annual reports both to the CSSF and to the electronic reference database of the financial centre’s investment funds set up by Finesti.
The platform allows the final validation of the documents that are to be sent.

<doc id="9640912" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9640912" title="Abenaki language">
Abenaki language

Abenaki, or Abnaki, is a nearly extinct Algonquian language of Quebec and Maine. There were two varieties, Eastern and Western, which differ in vocabulary and phonology, and are sometimes considered distinct languages.
Eastern Abenaki was spoken by several peoples, of which the last were the Penobscot of coastal Maine. The last known speaker died in the 1990s in Penobscot, Maine. Other dialects of Eastern Abenaki, such as "Caniba" and "Aroosagunticook", are documented in French-language materials from the colonial period.
In 1991, Western Abenaki was spoken by 20 individuals along the St. Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City, mostly at Odanak, the site of the former mission village of St. Francis, and by about 50 individuals living throughout New York state and Connecticut. By 2006 five speakers were recorded.
Language-revitalization efforts.
A new generation is actively preserving and revitalizing the language. Fluent speakers Joseph Elie Joubert from the Odanak reservation and Jesse Bowman Bruchac lead partial immersion classes in the language across the Northeast. They have created several books in and about the language as well as audio, video and web-based media to help others learn the language. In July 2013, the Penobscot Nation, the University of Maine and the American Philosophical Society received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to expand and publish the first Penobscot Dictionary.
The English word skunk, attested in New England in the 1630s, is probably borrowed from the Abenaki "seganku". About 500 Penobscot words are "still being used in the community in everyday language," such as "Muhmum" for "grandpa", and "nolke" for "deer."
Phonology.
The following description is for Western Abenaki.
Writing systems.
Several different writing systems have been developed by various authors for writing the sounds of Abenaki: Pial Pol Wzokihlain, Sozap Lolô, Henry Lorne Masta, and Gordon Day (author of the Western Abenaki Dictionary) each use a slightly different system. Common to all four are the characters A, B, D, E, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, S, T, U, W, and Z. Wzokihlain, Lolô, and Masta all have an additional digraph CH, which corresponds to Day's C. Lolô writes I for and ; where confusion could result, he writes Ï for .
Lolô and Masta use both W and U for the semivowel . Day consistently writes lax stops using voiced symbols: B, D, G, J, Z; the other three write lax consonants using P, T, K, Ch, S word-initially and word-finally. Day also consistently writes the schwa with E, while the others leave it unwritten when not stressed. Lolô and Day write the nasal vowel as Ô, while Wzokihlain writes O and Masta writes .

Coombes was educated at Hampton Grammar School, he was for some years in an insurance office, and became well known as an amateur runner and walker. He was captain of the Harefield Hare and Hounds Club, a champion walker of the London Athletic Club and captain of the Kingston upon Thames Bicycle Club.
Coombes emigrated to Sydney in 1886 and took up journalism, becoming a contributor to the "Referee". In 1888 he founded the New South Wales Amateur Athletic Association, introduced cross country running, and formed the Amateur Walkers Club. The amateur movement gradually spread all over Australia, and in 1897 the Amateur Athletic Union of Australia was formed. Coombes was a vice-president of the New South Wales Amateur Athletic Association from its foundation, in 1893 was elected president, and held the position until his death.
He also frequently acted as handicapper, starter, judge of field games or referee, at important athletic meetings, managed the New South Wales team in contests with the other states, and in 1911 was manager of the Australian team at the Empire games in London.
He was much interested in rifle-shooting, was captain of the Sydney Rifle Club and afterwards president, and was interested in rowing and coursing, being president of the New South Wales National Coursing Association for 22 years. When the Australian Coursing Union was formed in 1917 he was elected its first president 
About 1895 he formulated a set of walking rules which have been widely adopted.
As a journalist Coombes did a large amount of excellent work for the "Referee" under various pen-names.
He was editor for over 20 years, and showed himself to be a good editor and administrator. Advancing years led to his giving up the editorship, but he remained a contributor until 1932 when he resigned on a pension. He died at Sydney on 15 April 1935.
He married in 1895 Abbe May Talbot "née" Teas who survived him with a daughter, Gretchen. Coombes's greatest work was the inauguration of the Australasian amateur athletics movement, which at the time of his death was healthy, vigorous and carried on in the best traditions.
He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1992

Doe Run Company

Doe Run Resources Corporation (registered to do business as the Doe Run Company) is the largest integrated lead producer in North America and the largest primary lead producer in the western world. It owns two primary lead smelters (only one is active , and that one will close on December 31, 2013), five mills (four of which are active), several mines, the world's largest secondary lead smelter, all in southeast Missouri, USA, a polymetallic smelter at La Oroya and copper mine at Cobriza, both in Peru, and lead fabricating facilities in Arizona and Washington. It is wholly owned by the Renco Group which is in turn wholly owned by family trusts established by the company's Chairman and CEO, Ira Rennert. Total primary production in 2005 was 376,200 metric tons of lead, equivalent to 11.5% of world production that year. Doe Run also produced 123,800 metric tons of secondary lead and smaller tonnages of zinc and copper in concentrate.
Background.
Doe Run started life in 1864 as the St. Joseph Lead Company, better known as St. Joe, which started lead mining on a small scale in southeastern Missouri. Despite the isolation and hardships of those days, it prospered and in 1892 it started up its smelter in Herculaneum, where all smelting was consolidated in 1920. It was active elsewhere and eventually owned mines (now disposed of) in South America and zinc operations in New York State, USA. It also built up a portfolio of gold mines and prospects, including Chile's largest gold mine, El Indio, which became St. Joe Gold. It was sold in the 1980s and is now part of Barrick Gold.
With the gradual exhaustion of the Old Lead Belt after World War II, St. Joe and others explored other areas in southeastern Missouri and found more lead/zinc deposits, including the extensive Viburnum Trend on which Doe Run's U.S. mining operations are now concentrated.
In 1981, St. Joe was acquired by the Fluor Corporation. In 1986 St. Joe and Homestake Lead formed a short lived partnership called the Doe Run Company which brought Homestake's Buick mine, mill and smelter into St. Joe. After dissolution of the partnership, St. Joe converted the Buick smelter for lead recycling, which grew to be the biggest single site facility in the world. In 1994, the Renco Group acquired St. Joe from Fluor and renamed the company the Doe Run Resources Corporation, registered to do business as the Doe Run Company.
In 1994, Doe Run acquired lead fabricating facilities, and in 1997 it more than doubled in size with the purchase of the La Oroya smelter and Cobriza copper mine in Peru. 1998 saw the acquisition of ASARCO's Missouri Lead Division and its two mines and mills.
Operations in the United States.
Doe Run's U.S. mines are all on the Viburnum Trend, a 64 km long mineralized shoot with an average width of 150 meters, thickness of 3 to 30 meters and average depth of 300 meters. It is a classic Mississippi Valley type lead/zinc deposit in Cambrian carbonate rocks though it contains an unusually high proportion of lead.
The principal minerals are galena (lead, PbS) and sphalerite (zinc, ZnS) with lesser amounts of chalcopyrite (copper, CuFeS2). At the end of October 2005, ore reserves were approximately 34 million proven and probable tons at average grades of 6.23% lead, 1.36% zinc and 0.26% copper.
As of end October 2006, the company had six production shafts feeding four mills with a combined capacity of 21,000 metric tons per day which produced 255,600 metric tons of lead in concentrate plus zinc and copper byproducts. This was transported by public road to the primary lead smelter at Herculaneum, south of St Louis. It has a capacity of 227,000 metric tons of lead annually but is limited by permit to 181,500 metric tons. 2006 production was 140,300 metric tons of primary lead. The balance of the lead concentrates plus the zinc and copper concentrates were sold to other smelters One shaft, mill and smelter (Glover) were not in operation.
The recycling smelter at Boss, Missouri, handles old batteries, scrap lead and lead-bearing hazardous waste. It is permitted to produce 152,410 metric tons of lead annually and in 2005 produced only 123,800 metric tons of secondary lead due to a tight scrap market. Fabricated Products produces value-added lead products such as lead oxide, lead sheet and lead pipes at facilities in Arizona and Washington. This smelter, the only lead smelter in the United States, will cease operations on December 31, 2013.
Pollution at the U.S. operations.
Doe Run has been cited regularly by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for infringing emission limits, contaminating roads and generally polluting the immediate vicinity of the smelter. Exceeding of emission limits has resulted in the reduction of the permitted capacity of the Herculaneum smelter. Road contamination has resulted in orders to clean up certain roads and to wash down vehicles before they go onto public roads. The company has also been ordered by the EPA to address issues relating to elevated lead blood levels in the community and lead in community soils adjacent to the smelter. It has also spent US$10.4 million on buying up to 160 residential properties close to the smelter that are contaminated and is to clean up contaminated soils. The company has paid for research developing an electro- chemical replacement, Flubor for primary smelting of lead ore.
Former Operations in Peru.
"See entry on La Oroya for more details"
Doe Run used to own 99.97% of the La Oroya polymetallic smelter. It was established by the American Cerro de Pasco Corporation in 1922, was nationalized and became the property of Centromin in 1974 and was then privatized in 1997 when Doe Run bought it for US$247 million. It consists of a copper and lead smelter and zinc refinery. These are closely integrated and have additional circuits to recover byproducts, particularly from the 'dirty concentrates' produced by a number of local mines They include gold and silver (mainly from refinery residues), antimony, arsenic trioxide, bismuth, cadmium, indium, selenium, tellurium, sulfuric acid and oleum. Production in 2006 was 48,600 metric tons of copper, 120,600 metric tons of lead, 45,000 metric tons of zinc, 34 million troy ounces (1,060 metric tons) of silver and 67,000 troy ounces (2,080 kilograms) of gold.
The company also used to own the Cobriza copper mine, south of La Oroya, bought for US$7.5 million to ensure at least part of the concentrate supply to the smelter. It produced 16,244 metric tons of copper in concentrate in 2006 and had reserves of 6.5 million metric tons grading 1.2% copper.
Pollution at the Peruvian operations.
When Doe Run took over La Oroya, it also took over Centromin's PAMA (Programa de Adecuación y Manejo Ambiental or Environmental Remediation and Management Program), an environmental contract requiring environmental remediation measures that were to be completed over the next ten years. This was extended to twelve years, with Peruvian Government permission. Basically this program was to curb emissions of all types, gases, particulates and polluted water and clean up around the smelter and its waste dumps.
Until 1997 the smelter had been run without any concern for the environment with the result that the hills around the smelter had been reduced to a moonscape by sulfur dioxide from the smelters; the already polluted river had been made even more polluted by untreated process water; the soil in the city and surroundings had become contaminated with lead; the people in the city, especially the young, had dangerous levels of lead in their blood and many had bronchial troubles. In fact it was rated as one of the ten most polluted cities in the world by the Blacksmith Institute, a New York-based environmental group".
A gradual improvement of the conditions have not yet been confirmed by any independent Institution. Doe Run has reported reductions in river pollution and lead, arsenic and cadmium emissions. Sulfur dioxide emissions will have been reduced by the recent commissioning of the lead smelter acid plant and should be under control when the acid plant for the new copper smelter starts up in October 2008, according to the company's official statement. Doe Run has been indemnified by Centromin (and guaranteed by the Peruvian Government) against any environmental liability arising out of Centromin's prior operations. In May 2006 Doe Run received an extension to reduce toxic emissions and now has until 2009 to meet its targets. However, emissions are still well above limits set by the World Health Organization and the Peruvian government.
In October 2009 Doe Run still refuses to fulfill licensing requirements and orders forcing Peruvian authorities to grant another 30 months adjournment.
Lead usage.
Because of its toxicity, lead has lost many of its traditional markets such as paint, solder, tetraethyl lead (an additive to petrol/gasoline) and piping. On the other hand, it remains in strong demand for lead acid storage batteries which have been the dominant technology for automotive and other starting, lighting and ignition batteries as well as for motive power, telecommunication, network power, uninterruptible power systems and emergency lighting. By the early 2000s, the total demand for lead in all types of lead-acid storage batteries represented 88% of apparent U.S. lead consumption.

Posthegemony

Posthegemony or post-hegemony is a concept which designates a period or a situation in which hegemony is no longer said to function as the organizing principle of a national or post-national social order, or of the relationships between and amongst nation-states within the global order. The concept has different meanings within the fields of political theory, cultural studies and international relations.
In cultural studies.
In the field of cultural studies, posthegemony has been developed as a concept by a number of critics whose work engages with and critiques the use of cultural hegemony theory within the writings of Ernesto Laclau and within subaltern studies. George Yúdice, in 1995, was one of the first commentators to summarize the background to the emergence of this concept:
The shift to post-Fordism and other changes in the mode of production [...] correspond to a weakening of the articulation of
national discourse and state apparatuses, particularly the disciplinary, "educational" ones. This does not mean that the state itself has been weakened; it has, rather, reconverted to accommodate new forms of organization and capital accumulation. Flexible accumulation, consumer culture, and the "new world information order" are produced or distributed (made to flow) globally, to occupy the space of the nation, but are no longer "motivated" by any essential connections to a state, as embodied, for example, in a "national-popular" formation. Their motivations are both infra- and supranational. We might say that, from the purview of the national proscenium, a posthegemonic situation holds. That is, the "compromise solution" that culture provided for Gramsci is not now one that pertains to the national level but to the local and transnational. Instead, the "culture-ideology of consumerism" serves to naturalize global capitalism everywhere.
The concept of posthegemony is related to the rise of the "multitude" as a social force which, unlike the "people", cannot be captured by hegemony, together with the roles of affect and habitus in mechanisms of social control and agency. Posthegemony and its related terms are influenced by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, Pierre Bourdieu and Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri’s accounts of the supra- and infra-national forces that are said to have rendered obsolete the national-popular forms of coercion and consent through which, for Antonio Gramsci, hegemony structured and constituted society.
The features of posthegemony as a concept correspond closely to those of postmodernity. Thus, posthegemony theory argues that ideology is no longer a political driving force in mechanisms of social control, and that the modernist theory of hegemony, which depends on ideology, therefore no longer accurately reflects the social order. Some commentators also argue that history is not, as Karl Marx described it, a class struggle, but rather a "struggle to produce class".
The concept of posthegemony also resonates with the work of post-Foucauldian theorists such as Giorgio Agamben. Nicholas Thoburn, drawing on Agamben's discussion on the "state of exception," writes that "it is, perhaps, with the recasting of the relationship between law and politico-military and economic crises and interventions that is instituted in the state of exception that the time of hegemony is most revealed to have passed."
Criticism.
Among the criticisms of the theory of posthegemony is Richard Johnson's, that it involves "a marked reduction of social complexity." Johnson concedes that "one considerable achievement of ‘the post-hegemony project’ is to draw many observable post-9/11 features into a single imaginative picture, while also synthesizing different currents in contemporary social theory." But he argues that "it is strange, however, that the result is viewed as the end of hegemony rather than as a new hegemonic moment." He therefore calls for a rejuvenation of the concept of hegemony, rather than its abandonment.

Ebenezer Wake Cook

Ebenezer Wake Cook (28 December 1843–1926) was a water-colour painter.
Cook was born at Maldon, Essex, England and came to Melbourne in 1852. At 17 years of age Cook became an assistant to Nicholas Chevalier, who instructed him in painting, wood-engraving and lithography. He was one of the original members of the Victorian Academy of Arts in 1870. In 1872 Cook studied under Eugene von Guerard at the National Gallery of Victoria. In that year he won the medal for the best water-colour exhibited at the exhibition of the New South Wales Academy of Art. 
In 1873 Cook went to London, and from 1875 to 1926 was a constant exhibitor at the Royal Academy. In 1904 he published a pamphlet, "Anarchism in Art and Chaos in Criticism", which was followed in 1924 by "Retrogression in Art and the Suicide of the Royal Academy", an attack on all un-academic painters from Manet onwards. Cook for a time was president of the Langham Sketch Club, and an original member and honorary secretary of the Royal British-Colonial Society of Artists. Cook died early in 1926. His work was popular with some collectors and dealers, but it was often regarded as pretty when it was meant to be beautiful. Cook is represented in the national galleries at Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide.

King Jagiello Monument

[[File:The Wladyslaw Jagiello monument in NYC 7.jpg|thumb|right|The inscription on the plinth of the King Jagiello monument reads:
<br>king · jagiello
<br>King of Poland
<br>Grand Duke of Lithuania
<br>1386 - 1434
<br>Founder of a Free Union of the Peoples of East Central Europe
<br>Victor Over the Teutonic Aggressors at Grunwald
<br>July 15 · 1410]]
The King Jagiello Monument is an equestrian monument of king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, Władysław II Jagiełło, located in Central Park, New York City. Raised on its grand plinth it is one of the most prominently-sited and impressive of twenty-nine sculptures located in Central Park. The monument is sited overlooking the east end of the Turtle Pond, across from Belvedere Castle and just south-east from the Great Lawn. To the northeast is Cleopatra's Needle and beyond, the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
History.
The bronze monument was created for the Polish 1939 New York World's Fair pavilion by the Polish sculptor Stanisław K. Ostrowski (1879-1947). It stood at the Fair's entrance at Queens' Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Ostrowski's name is engraved in the front lower right-hand corner.
The statue at the 1939 World's Fair was a replica of a King Jagiello memorial in Warsaw that was converted into bullets for World War II by the Germans after they entered and occupied the capital of Poland. 
King Władysław II Jagiello is shown seated on a horse holding two crossed swords over his head as a symbol of defiance and of the union of Polish-Lithuanian forces. Known as the Grunwald Swords, they were the invitation to battle offered to the king and his ally Vytautas the Great in an ironic gesture by Ulrich von Jungingen, Grand Master of the Teutonic Order.
As a result of the German invasion of Poland that marked the beginning of the Second World War, the personnel and equipment of the Polish World's Fair pavilion was forced to remain in the United States. Unlike much of the rest of the pavilion which was sold to the Polish Museum of America in Chicago, the monument stayed in New York, thanks in part to mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia publicly lobbying to keep the statue. In July 1945, the statue was presented to the City of New York by the King Jagiello Monument Committee, with support from the Polish government in exile, and permanently placed in Central Park with the cooperation of the last pre-communist consul of Poland in New York, Kazimierz Krasicki. 
Parks Chief Consulting Architect Aymar Embury II (1880–1966) designed the granite pedestal. "POLAND" is inscribed on both sides of the plinth. 
The monument was conserved in 1986 by the Central Park Conservancy.
King Jagiello.
The monument represents the triumph of Władysław II Jagiello, who was one of the most famous kings in the histories of Poland and Lithuania, and the creator of the dynastic union of Poland and Lithuania, at the medieval Battle of Grunwald in 1410. Polish and Lithuanian forces, supported by a coalition of Ruthenian, Czech and Tatar allies soundly defeated the Teutonic Order, which had the support of the finest knights of the primarily German, Dutch and English camp.

The Greenphone was a smartphone developed by Trolltech with Qtopia Phone Edition, a GUI and application platform embedded in Linux using mostly free and open source software.
The proprietary software on the phone includes the communications stack and the package manager. However, Trolltech put these components under GPL in version 4.3 of Qtopia, making it possible to run the Greenphone with no proprietary components by updating its software to Qtopia 4.3.
On October 22, 2007, Trolltech announced that it had sold all inventory of Greenphones and would no longer continue production, having achieved its goal of promoting the Qtopia platform and gaining interest from developers. Focus was shifted to developing the Neo FreeRunner phone. Trolltech intends to continue supporting the Qtopia Greenphone community, and alternative hardware, such as the Neo 1973.
The Greenphone was named after Robert Green, an employee of Trolltech at that time, jokingly suggested it when the company was having trouble agreeing on a name for the phone.

Jubilee chicken

Jubilee chicken can refer to one of several chicken dishes created to celebrate the jubilees of different British monarchs.
The first version of Jubilee chicken was created for the silver jubilee of George V in 1935, and was based on chicken dressed with mayonnaise and curry. This was largely superseded by coronation chicken.
The second version of Jubilee chicken was created for Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee in 2002. This version was radically different from coronation chicken and was highly publicised at the time as a modern evolution of coronation chicken. Jubilee chicken was distributed in hampers to guests at the concerts for the Golden Jubilee. In spite of both of these, its popularity has remained relatively limited compared to coronation chicken.
For Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee in 2012, guests at the Royal Garden Party were served "Diamond Jubilee Chicken", a variation of coronation chicken created by Heston Blumenthal. This recipe does not appear to have been released to the public.
Dishes named "jubilee chicken" are often sold as ready to eat by supermarkets, or offered as recipes by alternate sources; the common features are pieces of chicken, curry flavouring, and mayonnaise or a similar sauce rather than a specific recipe.
Golden Jubilee Chicken.
Golden Jubilee chicken is a cold dish consisting of pieces of chicken in a white-coloured sauce dusted with parsley and lime segments. The sauce is a mixture of crème fraiche and mayonnaise flavoured with lime and ginger; the chicken is also marinated in a combination of lime and ginger before being mixed with the sauce. Jubilee chicken has a distinctive light, fresh taste. It is recommended to be served with pasta salad. Like coronation chicken, Jubilee chicken can be served as a sandwich filling.[http://www.lovefood.com/guide/recipes/14028/jubilee-chicken-sandwiches] 
In the UK this is the primary function of Coronation and Jubilee Chicken, not as a Pasta Salad even though the recipe cites it.

<doc id="9641283" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9641283" title="Poecilia velifera">
Poecilia velifera

Poecilia velifera, the Yucatan molly, lives in coastal waters of the Yucatan peninsula. These live-bearer (Poeciliidae) fish are particularly well known for both the extreme size variation among males, and the sexual dimorphism between males and females in both body shape and behavior.
It is outwardly similar to the sailfin molly, "P. latipinna", though larger overall and with a higher and longer dorsal fin in males. Full-grown fish are usually larger than 10 cm (4 in) and large females can reach almost twice this length, though especially captive-bred individuals grow only to the size of sailfin mollies. The dorsal fins are the most distinctive character for telling the species apart: Those of the Yucatan molly have nearly 20 fin rays, counting where the fin meets the back, whereas the sailfin molly has less than 15 (intermediate numbers may indicate hybrids).
If the males spread their dorsal fins in display, these have a distinct fan or trapezoid shape, with the upper edge being distinctly longer than the lower. The height of the dorsal fin, measured at the posterior edge, is a bit larger than the height of the tail.
Common names.
Some names of the Yucatan molly - such as "Segelkärpfling" or the specific name "velifera" - contain an element signifying "sail", aggravating the confusion with the sailfin molly. The French terms are used for both species indiscriminately, as is the Japanese name (which is simply the Japanized form of "sailfin molly").
In the aquarium.
Especially small strains are suitable for keeping in an aquarium. However, this fish is not as easy to keep as the sailfin molly, let alone the "P. sphenops" (black molly). They need spacious tanks with well-aerated, slightly brackish
water to thrive. They are able to withstand higher temperatures than most pet fish. Although they can survive over 30°C for prolonged periods of time if other conditions are good, temperatures should be kept between 25 and 30°C. Direct sunlight and an ample supply of plant food, such as lettuce, peas, or certain algae, are necessary for optimal health; in subtropical areas, they can be kept outside in unheated tanks in the summer; in temperate zones, backup heating may be necessary. This strain of molly can also be kept in saltwater reef tanks, and provide clean-up duties for the tank. To transition a molly to saltwater, adjustment time is needed; increase the salt content to match the reef tank over a period of three hours.
They are bred like other mollies; in line with their general requirements, this is somewhat more difficult than in related species. It is especially hard to get males to grow their spectacular fins. Professional breeders often separate males and females in winter, so that they are eager to breed in spring. Young can then, climate permitting, grow in spacious outdoor basins during summer.
Like other "Poecilia", they are prone to hybridization with their relatives. Not infrequently, crosses are attempted with the sailfin molly to breed a hardier fish. This is generally not very successful, and should not be attempted, as purebred Yucatan mollies are often quite hard to find, and hybrids will not have as massive dorsal fins as these. Several color variants are also available; these usually do not attain the large size of wild-type fish and may have been crossbred with "P. latipinna".

The school maintains a network of teaching facilities in more than 100 towns and cities across the five-state region. As part of this partnership, medical students from Alaska, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming spend their first years at state universities in their home states. In addition, twenty first-year students from Washington are based in Pullman, Washington and take classes with students based at the University of Idaho.
UW Medicine owns or operates the following:
In addition, UW Medicine shares in the ownership and governance of Children’s University Medical Group and Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, a partnership between UW Medicine, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and Seattle Children's.
History.
The school was founded in 1946 as the 76th medical school in the country and is a leader in primary care, family medicine, biomedical research, experimental therapy, clinical treatments, and academic medicine. In 2014, the UW School of Medicine was ranked #10 in research and #1 in primary care and in rural medicine by "U.S. News and World Report". The UW School of Medicine also ranks as one of the top medical schools in receipt of federal researching funding, having been awarded US$712.3 million in grants by the National Institutes of Health in 2009. Only Harvard Medical School was awarded more federal funding.
In May 2013, it was announced that UW Medicine and PeaceHealth were coming together in a "strategic affiliation." The American Civil Liberties Union criticized the merger as PeaceHealth is "directed by the Catholic Ethical and Religious Directives" and UW Medicine is taxpayer-funded.
Admissions.
Admission to UWSOM is competitive. In 2008, students accepted to the UWSOM MD program had a median GPA of 3.72 and an average MCAT of 10.3Q. Well over 90 percent of acceptances are applicants from Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana or Idaho. Applicants from outside this region who come from disadvantaged backgrounds and/or who have demonstrated a commitment to serving under-served populations are considered. According to the Medical School Admission Requirements (MSAR) of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), out of the 3,501 out of region applicants in 2007, 106 were interviewed and 34 were accepted for an acceptance rate of 0.97%. Admissions to the UWSOM Medical Scientist Training Program (MD/PhD) is also competitive. 10–14 students are selected each year, of which the average GPA is 3.8 and average MCAT is 36Q.

Countdown (2004 film)

Countdown (also known as "Personal Number", ) is a Russian action movie directed by Yevgeny Lavrentyev with a $7 million budget, which was huge for Russia of that time, and released in Moscow in December 2004.
The Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation assisted the shooting. Former Deputy FSB Director Vladimir Anisimov was hired consultant.
Despite its dubious artistic qualities, Countdown dramatizes many real life political concerns. In the very beginning the plot of the movie closely follows details of the independent investigation of the 1999 Russian apartment bombings described in the book "" by Yury Felshtinsky and Alexander Litvinenko, representing them as parts of the plan masterminded and sponsored by exiled tycoon Pokrovsky (obvious hint at Boris Berezovsky in real life) and aimed to discredit Russian security services. As this plan has failed, Pokrovsky assisted by some terrorists organizes a hostage taking in a Moscow circus (very similar to Moscow theater hostage crisis in real life) in order to return to Russia, acting as a saver of the hostages during negotiations. However, he fails to do so. The movie also depicts the Pankisi Gorge in Georgia as a place where an important Islamic militant hides, which was a common allegation by Russian authorities in real life around that time, and depicts destruction of a base of terrorists and allies of Pokrovsky in Qatar which might hint at the assassination of Zelimkhan Yandarbiev. Overall, the movie was widely considered propaganda.

Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program

The Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program is the standardized testing program used in public schools in Tennessee.
Tennessee schools administer a comprehensive exam to their students at the end of each school year beginning in the third grade. Tests are intended to reflect what each child learned in the past year of school. The tested areas include reading, language arts, math, science, and social studies. The TCAP currently includes the Achievement Test (grades 3-8), the Writing Test, the Competency Test, the Gateway Tests and the End of Course Tests. The scores are returned at the beginning of the next school year and these scores help schools make instructional decisions. Special education and limited-English proficiency students are included in the testing and may be accommodated with modifications. This test was previously known as the Terra Nova test.
The current program was influenced by the federal No Child Left Behind Act.
In 2010, a linking study will be performed so that the TCAP can report out Lexile measures for students in grades 3-8 and 10. A Lexile measure can be used to match readers with targeted text and monitor growth in reading ability.

HIV/AIDS in Iraq

Officially the AIDS-HIV pandemic came to Iraq via contaminated blood in 1986, with haemophiliacs being the primary victims. Over the decades, educational and treatment initiatives have been slowed by prevailing cultural values as well as severe economic hardships brought about by sanctions and war.
1986–2003.
According to the Iraqi government, and a subsequent lawsuit, the pandemic came to Iraq via contaminated blood in 1986, with haemophiliacs being the initial victims. The Ba'athists relocated Iraqis found to be infected with AIDS-HIV to a segregated medical facility. No one was allowed to visit these facilities, patients were basically prisoners and were given secret burials. Ignorance about the disease was commonplace, even among the government itself. 
The former Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, wrongly believed that the disease could be spread through casual contact and felt that infected Iraqis should be exterminated or imprisoned. When the regime fell, these segregated hospitals were looted and the surviving patients were left to wander the streets.
Post-Ba'athist.
As early as 2004 the United Nations IRIN news service reported on the challenges involved in AIDS-HIV treatment and education in Iraq. Almost no education existed regarding AIDS-HIV during the Ba'athist regime and thus a high degree of ignorance and fear surrounds the pandemic and its victims.
The Iraqi government offers free medical services and financial assistance to all Iraqi citizens living with AIDS-HIV. This includes regular checkups for the infected person, along with checkups for their partners and family members. Public service announcements and some education in the schools have begun at a slow pace. 
Government health officials have some reason to be concerned, as some Muslim fundamentalist and sectarian militias have been known to harass and even kill infected Iraqis on the grounds that being infected with AIDS-HIV is evidence of sin.
In Baghdad several clinics specialize in AIDS-HIV, while outside of the capital, there are similar clinics in each region, although there are still shortages in medical care. 
In 2005 representatives from the Iraqi Health Ministry traveled to Jordan to speak with public health officials about Jordanian efforts to stop the spread of the pandemic.
In 2006 the government in northern Iraq, Kurdistan, began to deport foreigners found to be HIV-positive because the government does not have the resources of facilities to offer treatment to its own citizens, let alone foreigners.
Ignorance about the pandemic remains widespread and it is taboo to discuss the ways in which the virus can be spread or to encourage the usage of condoms.

Academically Talented Youth Programs

Begun in 1981, ATYP – Academically Talented Youth Programs – is a K-12/higher education collaborative model that works cooperatively with over 60 public and private school districts. 
Seventh through ninth graders are assessed for their higher level math and verbal potential identified through the Midwest Academic Talent Search (MATS). They attend ATYP’s weekly 2.5-hour class. The students’ SAT scores, rather than their grade level, indicate their readiness for the classes. Qualifying scores, set at levels similar to Talent Search’ summer programs, use the SAT verbal score to indicate readiness for the writing/literature class. The SAT math score, and a combined math plus verbal score, qualify students for the math class. Because the program focuses on serving higher levels of potential, very few students qualify for both the English and the math class. 
The students’ motivation to work hard alongside their commitment to the program’s rigor contribute to their ultimate success. Independent and small group work helps students complete the 6-8 hour weekly homework assignment. Housed on the campus of Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo and Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids, ATYP provides fast-paced classes during the school year, in conjunction with the student’s regular school schedule. ATYP’s first two years cover pre-AP content; the third year focuses at the AP English Language and Composition and AP Calculus BC level. Because the course's students need to be challenged at all ages, not only at high school age, the ATYP model begins to identify students who will perform well in the classes at as early as 6th grade. Once identified, the students are invited to take the SAT or ACT to see if they can qualify.

Saghira

Saghira (Arabic for "little girl") is a Muslim doll that was created as an alternative to other mainstream dolls which usually are made in western countries. Saghira is now a 17 and half inch doll that is available in North Africa, parts of Europe and the Middle East.
Manufacturer.
Saghira was created by a Moroccan manufacturer SAGHIRA SARL between the years 2005 and 2006 and started selling in the Morocco market in January 2007.
Models.
Saghira comes now in just one model. Previously Saghira came under different model names but as this proved difficult to market, Saghira's company decided to concentrate on its core model only. Previous models were called Amira (princess), Doaa (Prayer), Aya, Abir, Ahd, Shada, Nada, Dahab, Najma, Nour. These may actually be brought back in future years when Saghira establishes more of a name for itself.
Attires and Accessories.
Saghira's attires are a mix of both authentic traditional clothing as well as Western clothes. All but the western versions of Saghira come with doll accessories based on articles usually found in Arabic and Muslim homes.
Saghira comes with veiled and unveiled models. Usually unveiled models depict Saghira within her home or in a family environment.

Elizabeth Selden Rogers

Elizabeth Selden White Rogers (July 23, 1868 – December 18, 1950) was a civic reformer working to improve the New York public schools, and to win suffrage for women in the state of New York and the nation.
Early life and education.
She was born on July 23, 1868, in Astoria, Queens, New York. Her sister was Mabel Wellington White, wife of US Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, she was also the maternal granddaughter of Union Major General Amos Beebe Eaton and a descendant of Roger Sherman, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.
Elizabeth Selden Rogers married John Rogers (1865-1939) in 1895. He was later at the Cornell Medical School. They had a daughter, Elizabeth Selden Rogers, who married Francis H. Horan, and two sons.
Career.
She was chairman of the Advisory Council of the National Woman's Party and its Legislative Chairman for New York, and was one of the most forceful speakers in the "Prison Special" bus tour across the country; during which suffragists spoke of their experience in jail. Rogers was arrested, as part of the Silent Sentinels protest, on July 14, 1917 for picketing in front of the United States White House, and was sentenced to sixty days in Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia; but she was quickly pardoned by US President Woodrow Wilson after just three days. 
Elizabeth Selden Rogers, editorial entitled "Why We Withdrew," in Women's Political World, 1915
A great deal is said of the value of co-operation of all societies and the economy of not duplicating work. While believing heartily in a certain amount and kind of co-operation, we are not blind to the fact that too complete unity may result. in stagnation ... The [Women's Political) Union believes that the existence of many suffrage societies is an evidence of the vitality of the movement, and that the friendly rivalry of such societies results in more and better work being done, that it gives the freedom necessary to growth, affording scope for individuality, and allowing personality to count. ... To those of our members who are worrying over this co-operate (sic) idea, we would point out that if in the past four or five years the Women's Political Union in New York City had been bound by a two-thirds vote of a campaign committee, like the one now formed, we would never have had a parade, or an outdoor meeting, or a campaign against certain enemies in the Legislature.
Personal life.
Elizabeth Selden White Rogers died on December 18, 1950 in New York City.

Yukon (band)

Yukon was a three-piece experimental band from Baltimore, MD.
The band consisted of Nick Podgurski (drums/vocals), Sam Garrett (guitar) and Brad Smith (bass). Various four-piece incarnations included Denny Bowen (of Double Dagger and Roomrunner), and Tom Ferrara ( Of the Del-Satins and the Capris).
Regional and national touring with Little Women, Calabi Yau, Archaeopteryx and Rick Weaver of The New Flesh. 
Yukon also performed at Whartscape and the International Noise Conference (Miami, FL) in 2007.
Members of Yukon co-curated with fellow Brooklyn math-rock band, Stay Fucked, the Dark Forces Swing Blind Punches festival in Philadelphia, which was held December 2006 and featured current innovative music from bands such as Dysrhythmia and Zs.
2007's Mortar was co-released by the band in part with Terra Firma Records. It was followed in 2008 by Medallion on Infinite Limbs. In the time that passed between Mortar and Medallion the band saw the exchange of original guitarist Tom Ferrara for Sam Garrett and the exit of guitarist/vocalist Denny Bowen. Medallion is the only recorded output of the shortly lived four-piece including both Garrett and Bowen on guitar. Medallion was recorded with Bowen on guitar after his leaving the band. This began the band's shift into trio and Podgurski's role as both drummer and vocalist. In early 2009, the song "Zero Gravity Chamber" was re-released as part of Damage Rituals Cassettes' "The Dead Hand: Human Machines" compilation along with tracks from groups such as Zs, Weasel Walter Trio, and Muscle Brain.
The final self-titled record is available on cassette via Damage Rituals Cassettes. This is last record and only full-length featuring the trio lineup.
N. Podgurski now runs New Firmament and performs as both New Firmament and Feast of the Epiphany. Sam Garrett is currently an active composer of both chamber works and music under the name Voice Coils. Brad Smith is playing bass in Slow Bull.

Caulophyllum

Caulophyllum is a small genus of perennial herbs in the family Berberidaceae. It is native to eastern Asia and eastern North America. These plants are distinctive spring wildflowers, which grow in moist, rich woodland, it is known for its large triple-compound leaf, and large blue, berry-like fruits. Unlike many spring wildflowers, it is not an ephemeral plant and persists throughout much of the summer. Common names for plants in this genus include Blue Cohosh, Squaw Root, and Papoose Root. As hinted at by its common names, this plant is well known as an alternative medicine for inducing childbirth and menstrual flow; it is also considered a poisonous plant.
Description.
These large, smooth plants (0.3–0.9 m tall) have a single to few stems with each stem bearing normally one, but on large stems two, large triple-compound leafs which the casual observer might assume to be several smaller leaves arranged on three separate branches. Each leaflet ends in three to five distinct tips. Plants produce under ground stems called rhizomes that give rise to the leaves each spring and in the fall when the foliage dies back a scar is left on the rhizome and a new bud is formed that will grow into the foliage next spring. Plants are long lived and can live for more than 50 years, they are found in wooded locations with moisture retentive soils.
In April or May, each mature stem bears a spike of flowers. Each flower has six petal-like sepals which range from greenish-yellow to purple. The different rates of maturity between the stamens and the pistil insures cross pollination. There are six fleshy nectar glands at the base of each sepal which attract pollinators. Each fertilized flower matures into a large (1 cm) deep-blue berry-like fruit which houses two bitter seeds. The large seeds are covered with a characteristic blue coat and the fruits remain on the plants until fall. Seed germination can take a few years and the seedlings are hypogeal, the cotyledons remaining underground after germination and seedling emergence, the seedlings need a few years of growth before they are large enough to flower.
Species.
All species in this genus are very similar. Until recently, this genus was considered to be composed of only two species, however the Flora of North America recognizes "Caulophyllum giganteum", as a distinct species rather than a subspecies of "Caulophyllum thalictroides". "Caulophyllum giganteum" is slightly larger, has a more northerly (but overlapping) distribution, and blooms two weeks earlier than "Caulophyllum thalictroides". "Caulophyllum giganteum" also has fewer flowers, that are consistently purplish.
Uses.
These poisonous plants has been used for many things throughout history, the three similar species generally have similar properties and uses. This plant is occasionally used in woodland gardens as an ornamental. Children should not be allowed to eat the attractive blue fruits, as these plants contain chemicals that are known to cause cell damage. The powdered roots have been shown to cause dermatitis and irritation of the mucous membranes.
Food.
Historically, the roasted seeds have been used as a coffee substitute; this beverage does not contain caffeine.
Medicine.
WARNING: This plants should not be used by pregnant women. As this is a known poisonous plant, care should be taken by anyone using this plant.
Historically the root of "Caulophyllum" has been used as a medicine for: cancer, internal parasites, smooth muscle function, spasms, diuretic, menstruation, and childbirth. It is best known for the latter two uses. Various Native American tribes are also recorded as having used this plant for similar medicinal purposes. While no current widely marketed medicines are based on this plant, modern herbalists and practitioners of alternative medicine still utilize this plant as a natural therapy. Research on the medicinal potentials of this plant are ongoing.

Walk In Lay Down

Walk In Lay Down (commonly referred to as WILD) is a semiannual concert event held in the Brookings Quadrangle at Washington University in St. Louis, begun in 1973. WILD is sponsored by the Washington University Student Union, is produced by the student group Social Programming Board (Official Site), and is one of the biggest social events on campus. WILD is free to University students and faculty, and students may purchase tickets for visitors. Drinking on the day of WILD is very commonplace and students who are over 21 are allowed to pick up three cups of 12-oz beer at the event. Held at the beginning of the fall semester and the end of the spring semester, WILD generally features several local bands and one or two nationally known recording artists or groups. Recent headliners at WILD include Wolfgang Gartner, 3LAU, Karmin, and Chance the Rapper.
History.
WILD was begun in 1973. The concert is named for an old tradition in which students would bring sofas into the quad and lie on them while watching the performances. This tradition is still allowed, but is no longer commonplace. In fall 2007, the University attempted to revive this tradition by supplying inflatable couches for use during the concert.

Clayton Kershaw

Clayton Edward Kershaw (born March 19, 1988) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). A left-handed starting pitcher, Kershaw has played in the major leagues since 2008 and his career earned run average is the lowest among starters in the live-ball era with a minimum of 1,000 innings pitched.
Kershaw was drafted seventh overall in the 2006 MLB Draft. He worked his way through the Dodgers' farm system in just one full season and reached the majors at 20 years old. When he debuted in 2008, he was the youngest player in MLB, a title he held for one full year. In 2011, he won the pitching Triple Crown and the National League Cy Young Award, becoming the youngest pitcher to accomplish either of these feats since Dwight Gooden in 1985. Being a left-handed strikeout pitcher and playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Kershaw has often been compared to Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax. Kershaw pitched a no-hitter on June 18, 2014, becoming the 22nd Dodger to do so.
Off the field, Kershaw is an active participant in volunteer work. He and his wife, Ellen, launched "Kershaw’s Challenge" and wrote the book "Arise" to help to raise money to build an orphanage in Zambia. He has been honored with the Roberto Clemente Award and the Branch Rickey Award for his humanitarian work.
Early life.
Kershaw was born in Dallas, Texas. His parents divorced when he was 10 and he was raised by his mother. He played in youth sports leagues as a child, including Little League Baseball.
Kershaw attended nearby Highland Park High School, where he played baseball and was also the center on the football team. After a growth spurt and further development of his pitches he established himself as an elite high school prospect in 2006 when he posted a 13–0 record with an earned run average (ERA) of 0.77, and recorded 139 strikeouts in 64 innings pitched. In a playoff game against Justin Northwest High School, Kershaw pitched an all-strikeout perfect game. He struck out all 15 batters he faced in the game, which was shortened because of the mercy rule. He also pitched for USA Baseball's Junior National Team in the Pan Am Championship. Kershaw was selected by "USA Today" as "High School Baseball Player of the Year", and was also the Gatorade National Player of the Year for baseball.
Entering the 2006 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft, Kershaw was considered the top high-school pitcher available. The Los Angeles Dodgers selected Kershaw with the seventh overall pick in the draft. He had committed to Texas A&M University but turned down their scholarship offer to sign with the Dodgers, with a bonus estimated at $2.3 million. The bonus was the largest to any Dodgers draft pick at the time, which was eventually topped by Zach Lee in the 2010 Draft.
Minor league career.
Kershaw began his career with the Gulf Coast League (GCL) Dodgers. He pitched in 37 innings in which he struck out 54 batters (walking only 5), while compiling a record of 2–0 with a 1.95 ERA. He featured a fastball that topped out at and he was rated as the top prospect in the GCL, and the Dodgers' second best prospect by "Baseball America" behind third baseman Andy LaRoche.
Kershaw was promoted to the Great Lakes Loons in 2007, where he recorded a record of 7–5 with a 2.77 earned run average. He was selected to play on the East Team in the Midwest League All-Star Game and on the USA team in the All-Star Futures Game. On August 6, he was promoted to the Double-A Jacksonville Suns in the Southern League, where he produced a 1–2 record and 3.65 ERA in five starts and was selected as the top prospect in the Dodgers organization heading into the 2008 season.
During spring training in a game against the Boston Red Sox, Kershaw gained much attention for throwing a curveball to Sean Casey that started behind Casey but at the end looped into the strike zone and struck him out looking. Kershaw was 0–3 and had a 2.28 ERA with 47 strikeouts through 43 innings pitched in his first stint of the year with the Suns. He was then called up to the majors on May 28, 2008, but optioned back to Jacksonville on July 2.
Kershaw pitched 18 innings during his second trip to Jacksonville (two starts and one seven inning relief appearance), winning two games. During this stretch, he allowed only two runs earned runs, lowering his ERA to 1.91. He was recalled on July 22.
Major league career.
Los Angeles Dodgers.
2008–2010 seasons: Early career.
On May 24, 2008, the Dodgers bought Kershaw's minor-league contract, and he was added to the active roster. Sportswriter Tony Jackson called Kershaw's debut the most anticipated start by a Dodgers pitcher since Hideo Nomo's major league debut during the 1995 season. He made his debut on May 25, starting against the St. Louis Cardinals. He struck out the first batter he faced, Skip Schumaker, the first of seven strikeouts in the game, in which he pitched six innings and allowed two runs. When he debuted, Kershaw was the youngest player in MLB, a title he held for one full year.
Kershaw won his first major league game against the Washington Nationals on July 27, 2008. He pitched six-plus shutout innings, allowing four hits, a walk, and he struck out five. Kershaw finished his rookie season 5–5, with a 4.26 ERA in 22 games (21 starts). He also pitched two innings out of the bullpen for the Dodgers in the 2008 National League Championship Series (NLCS) against the Philadelphia Phillies.
On April 15, 2009, Kershaw pitched seven innings, striking out 13 batters while allowing only one hit (a solo home run) against the rival San Francisco Giants. He was the youngest Dodger to ever strikeout 13 or more batters in a game since Sandy Koufax did it in the 1955 season. On May 17, 2009, Kershaw did not allow a hit against the Florida Marlins through 7 innings, then gave up a lead-off double to Florida's Cody Ross. In 2009, despite an 8–8 record, he led the major leagues in opposing batting average (.200), opposing slugging percentage (.282), and hits per nine innings (6.26). He also posted an ERA of 2.79 and 185 strikeouts. Kershaw also walked 91 batters, which was second most in the National League (NL).
Kershaw made his playoff starting debut against the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2009 National League Division Series (NLDS). He went 6 innings, striking out 4, walking 1, and ended up getting a no-decision (the Dodgers went on to win the game in the 9th inning). At 21 years old, he started the opener of the 2009 NLCS against the Philadelphia Phillies and was the third youngest pitcher to ever start a playoff series opener, behind only Fernando Valenzuela in the 1981 NLDS and Rick Ankiel in the 2000 NLDS.
Kershaw started the 2010 season by posting a 3.07 ERA in April, but did so by walking 22 batters in 29 innings. On May 4, he had his worst start of his career against the Milwaukee Brewers at Dodger Stadium, throwing just 57 pitches in 1 innings, while retiring only four of the 13 batters he faced—including the pitcher. He was booed loudly upon being pulled from the game. Kershaw said after the game, "I didn't give our team any kind of chance. It's just not a good feeling to let your teammates down, let everybody down. It stings, it hurts. I've got to figure things out."
Kershaw rebounded his next start by pitching an 8 inning two-hitter and out-dueling the then undefeated Ubaldo Jiménez. He credited his control of the slider being the major turning point for him. Later in the season, he was suspended for five games after hitting Aaron Rowand of the Giants with a pitch in a game on July 20. The incident occurred after both teams were given a warning following Giants ace Tim Lincecum hitting Matt Kemp earlier in the game. He threw his first career complete game shutout on September 14, 2010 also against San Francisco and finished the season with a record of 13–10 and a 2.91 ERA in 32 starts, pitching 204 innings and recording 212 strikeouts.
2011 season: Cy Young Award.
After finishing the 2010 season strong, the Dodgers named Kershaw as the Opening Day Starter for the 2011 season. On May 29, he pitched the second complete-game shutout of his career, striking out 10 while winning a two-hitter against the Florida Marlins, 8–0; he also had two singles and an RBI, scoring twice in the game. He produced his third career shutout on June 20, a two-hit, 11-strikeout effort against the Detroit Tigers. Kershaw became the first Dodgers starter to strike out the side in the 9th inning since Sandy Koufax's perfect game. In his next start, on June 26, Kershaw pitched another complete game (against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim). He became the first Dodger starter to have back-to-back complete game victories since Jeff Weaver in the 2005 season and the first Dodger to have double-digit strikeouts in consecutive starts since Chan-Ho Park in the 2000 season. He was awarded the National League Player of the Week award for the week of June 20–26 as a result of those two starts. Midway through June, Kershaw had amassed 32 career victories, a 3.15 ERA and 593 career strikeouts in 568.2 innings. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Kershaw was the first 23-year-old pitcher to have that many victories, an ERA that low and an average of more than one strikeout per inning since ERA became an official statistic in 1910.
Kershaw was selected to the National League team for the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, his first All-Star selection. In the month of July, Kershaw was 4–1 with a 2.02 ERA and NL-leading 45 strikeouts, earning him the National League Pitcher of the Month Award. On August 23, he struck out Matt Holliday of the St. Louis Cardinals for his 200th strikeout of the season and became the 10th Dodger pitcher to record back-to-back 200 strikeout seasons and the first since Chan-Ho Park did it in the 2001 season.
Kershaw finished the 2011 season by leading the NL with 21 wins, 248 strikeouts and a 2.28 ERA, winning the NL pitching Triple Crown, the first Triple Crown winner since Jake Peavy of the 2007 San Diego Padres and the first Dodger since Sandy Koufax won it in the 1966 season. Justin Verlander of the Detroit Tigers won the American League Triple Crown the same season, marking the first major-league season since 1924 to feature Triple Crown-winning pitchers in both leagues. Kershaw's 21 wins were the most by a Dodger pitcher since Orel Hershiser won 23 during the 1988 season. His ERA was the lowest by a Dodger since Hershiser's 2.03 in the 1985 season, his strikeouts were the most by a Dodger since Koufax's 317 in 1966 and his 233 innings pitched were the most since Chan Ho Park pitched 234 in 2001. Since 1965 when Koufax did it, Peavy and Kershaw are only two pitchers in the National League have led the league in wins, strikeouts, ERA, and WHIP (walks plus hits per inning pitched). Kershaw also became just the second lefthander to have a 240-plus strikeouts in a season before the age of 24, joining Vida Blue.
After the season, Kershaw was awarded the Warren Spahn Award as the best left-handed pitcher in 2011, the Players Choice Award for Most Outstanding National League pitcher, the Gold Glove Award as the top fielding pitcher in the NL and the "Sporting News" (TSN) National League Pitcher of the Year. He was additionally selected as the starting pitcher for the TSN NL All-Star Team. On November 17, he was honored with the National League Cy Young Award, making him the youngest Cy Young winner since Dwight Gooden of the 1985 New York Mets. He was the 8th Dodger pitcher to the win the award, the first since Eric Gagné in the 2003 season.
2012 season: Cy Young runner-up.
On February 7, 2012, Kershaw and the Dodgers agreed on a two-year, $19 million contract. The contract was the second highest for a player in his first year of arbitration (after Tim Lincecum's $23 million 2-year contract in 2010).
Kershaw was the Dodgers' Opening Day starter for the second year in a row, where he pitched three innings of shutout ball against the San Diego Padres at Petco Park before being removed from the game due to flu-like symptoms. On April 27, he was able to last through eight innings for his second win of the season against the Washington Nationals. The win was also his 12th straight home win, tying him with Ed Roebuck (June 1960 – August 1962) and Orel Hershiser (September 1984 – October 1985) for the longest home winning streak since the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles. Kershaw won the National League's Player of the Week Award for the week of May 14–20 after he made two starts during that week and pitched 16 scoreless innings, including his fourth career shutout. Kershaw was selected to appear in the 2012 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, the second straight year he made the team. On August 11, he went over 200 innings on the season, becoming the 12th Los Angeles Dodger pitcher with three or more seasons of 200 or more innings, and the first since Hershiser did it five times from 1985–1989. Kershaw also became just the fifth Dodger pitcher with three straight 200 strikeout seasons.
Kershaw finished 2012 with a 14–9 record, a 2.53 ERA (leading the league), 229 strikeouts, and 227 innings pitched, coming second in both categories. He became the first pitcher to lead the league in ERA in consecutive seasons since Arizona's Randy Johnson in 2001–02. This was also marked his fourth year in a row with a sub-3.00 ERA, making him the first to do this since Randy Johnson from 1999–2002. He finished second for the NL Cy Young behind R. A. Dickey, receiving two first place votes.
2013 season: 2nd Cy Young Award.
Kershaw made his third straight opening day start for the Dodgers in the 2013 season, the first Dodger starter to do so since Derek Lowe (2005–2007). In that opening day start he pitched a complete game, four hit, shutout over the Giants and also hit his first career home run. He was the first pitcher to throw a shutout and hit a home run on opening day since Bob Lemon of the Cleveland Indians did so against the Chicago White Sox on April 14, 1953. Kershaw picked up his 1,000th career strikeout on April 17, 2013, when he struck out Yonder Alonso of the Padres. He was the second youngest Dodger to reach that mark, behind only Fernando Valenzuela. On May 14, Kershaw passed the 1,000 inning mark for his career. His ERA of 2.70 at the time was the fifth best of the live-ball era at the 1,000 inning mark and the best career mark. He also threw 130 pitches that day, the most of his career and the most by a Dodger pitcher since Odalis Pérez in the 2003 season.
Kershaw was selected to the 2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, his third straight selection. In July, he compiled a 4–1 record and 1.34 ERA in six starts and was awarded his second National League Pitcher of the Month Award. On September 2, Kershaw picked up his 200th strikeout of 2013, joining Hall of Famers Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale as the only starters in Dodgers history with at least 4 consecutive seasons of more than 200 strikeouts.
Kershaw finished the season with a 16-9 record, 236 innings pitched (a career high), and a Major League best 1.83 ERA and 0.92 WHIP. He was the third player in history to lead the Majors in ERA three years in a row, joining Greg Maddux (1993–95) and Lefty Grove (1929–31). His ERA was the first sub-2.00 ERA since Roger Clemens did it in the 2005 season and the lowest overall since Pedro Martinez in the 2000 season. He was only the third Dodger pitcher to have an ERA under 3.00 in five consecutive seasons (Koufax and Nap Rucker).
Kershaw struck out 12 batters in seven innings in the first game of the 2013 National League Division Series. That was the third most strikeouts by a Dodger pitcher in the playoffs, behind only Koufax (15 in the 1963 World Series) and Carl Erskine (14 in the 1953 World Series). His six straight strikeouts in the game tied a MLB post-season record set by Tim Belcher in the second game of the 1988 World Series. He picked up his first career post-season victory in that game. The Dodgers would end up losing in the NLCS to the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Kershaw won the Warren Spahn Award for 2013, the second time he had won the award, which honors the best left-handed pitcher in the Major Leagues. He was also selected to the Sporting News NL All-Star team, the fourth Dodger pitcher to be named to the team twice (after Koufax, Valenzuela and Don Newcombe). On November 13, he won the NL Cy Young Award for the second time in three seasons. He became just the sixth pitcher in history to finish in the top two in voting three seasons in a row.
After the season, Kershaw and the Dodgers agreed on a seven-year, $215 million, contract extension. The deal was the richest in MLB history for a pitcher, eclipsing the seven-year, $180 million, contract signed by Justin Verlander the previous year. The average annual value of $30.7 million was also the largest ever for a baseball player, beating the $28 million Roger Clemens received in 2007 and the ten-year $275 million contract that Alex Rodriguez signed that same year.
2014.
Kershaw made his fourth straight opening day start for the Dodgers in 2014, only the fourth Dodger ever to do so. This season the game was played at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Australia. Before his second start, Kershaw felt some pain in his back and was placed on the disabled list for the first time in his career. He did not rejoin the Dodgers until early May. On June 18, he pitched a complete game no-hitter against the Colorado Rockies and struck out a career-high 15 batters. The only batter to reach base was due to an error in the top of the seventh inning, costing Kershaw a perfect game. He is the only pitcher in MLB history with 15 strikeouts in a game while allowing no hits and no walks. Kershaw was 6-0 with an 0.82 in June and was awarded with his third career Pitcher of the Month award. He was selected to the National League squad at the 2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, his fourth straight selection. He was the sixth Dodger pitcher, and the first since Fernando Valenzuela to make the All-Star team four years in a row.
Clayton Kershaw is currently 10-2 with an ERA of 1.85 as of July,2014.
Pitching style.
Kershaw's pitching style relies on a lot of deception. He keeps the ball hidden so that it is hard for the batter to pick up the ball and has a consistent delivery on all of his pitches. Out of the stretch, he uses a slide step as it makes it difficult for the base runner at first base to get a read on him. He has stated many times that he has modeled his pitching mechanics after his favorite pitcher growing up, Roger Clemens.
Kershaw's repertoire includes a four-seam fastball that sits anywhere from to (tops out at ) with late movement, a slider at –, a 12–6 curveball between –, and a seldom thrown changeup.
He is also known for having one of the better pickoff moves to first base and is considered one of the better fielding pitchers in the game.
Preparation.
According to many teammates, Kershaw is a noted perfectionist. A.J. Ellis describes his preparation and perfectionism during bullpens before each start: 
Personal life.
Kershaw grew up in Dallas, Texas and attended school with quarterback Matthew Stafford and fellow pitchers Jordan Walden and Shawn Tolleson. One of his favorite players growing up was former Texas Rangers first baseman Will Clark, and the main reason he wears number 22 is to honor Clark.
He is the great-nephew of astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, the discoverer of Pluto. Kershaw's mother, born Marianne Tombaugh, is the daughter of Clyde Tombaugh's younger brother. His father, Christopher George Kershaw, was a musician and won a Clio Award for his work. The elder Kershaw remarried after his divorce from Marianne and died in 2013.
On December 4, 2010, Kershaw married his girlfriend of seven years, Ellen Melson. He is a Methodist with strong religious faith.
Humanitarian work.
Prior to the 2011 season, Kershaw visited Zambia with his wife as part of a Christian mission organized by Dallas-based Arise Africa. After the trip, Kershaw announced his dream of building an orphanage in Lusaka, Zambia, which he called "Hope's Home" after 11-year-old Hope, an HIV-positive child Kershaw met while in Zambia. To accomplish his goal, Kershaw pledged a donation of $100 per strikeout recorded in 2011. With Kershaw's career high of 248 strikeouts thrown during the 2011 season, he donated $492,300 toward his $70,000 goal. When Kershaw won the 2011 Players Choice Award, he donated $260,000 to Hope's Home. He and his wife returned to Zambia in 2012. Kershaw donated $100 for every strikeout in the 2012 season to Kershaw's Challenge, calling that season's incarnation of the project "Strike Out To Serve." Seventy percent of the money raised in 2012 went to Arise Africa, with 10 percent each going to the Peacock Foundation in Los Angeles, Mercy Street in Dallas, and I Am Second.
In addition to Hope's Home and Kershaw's Challenge, he has also helped with other programs in Los Angeles, such as helping Habitat for Humanity demolish and rehabilitate a house in Lynwood, California. He is also a supporter of the Peacock Foundation, which provides animal-assisted interventions and activities for at risk youth by partnering with mental health practitioners, public service agencies and community organizations.
Kershaw was recognized for his charity work by being honored with the Roberto Clemente Award in 2012, the top humanitarian honor bestowed by Major League Baseball. In 2013, he received the Branch Rickey Award in recognition of outstanding community service, presented by the Rotary Club of Denver.
Author.
Kershaw and his wife, Ellen, co-authored a book named "Arise: Live Out Your Faith and Dreams on Whatever Field You Find Yourself " about their Christian faith and their humanitarian efforts. The book was released on January 5, 2012 through Regal Press.

Abdul Sattar

Abdul Sattar () is a male Muslim given name, built on the Arabic words "Abd", "al-" and "Sattar". The name means "servant of the Veiler (of sins)".
Because the letter s is a sun letter, the letter l of the "al-" is usually assimilated to it. Thus although the name is written with letters corresponding to "Abd al-Sattar", the usual pronunciation corresponds to "Abd as-Sattar". Alternative transliterations include "Abdus Sattar", "Abd al-Sattar" and others, all subject to variant spacing and hyphenation. It may refer to:

The Cronulla-Sutherland District Rugby Football League (Cronulla-Sutherland District Junior Rugby Football League in the case of junior football) is an amateur competition for rugby league clubs in and around the Sutherland Shire district of New South Wales, Australia.and then this one said Aqinas
The Cronulla-Sutherland District Rugby Football League was formed in the early 1950s following the formation of several new Sutherland Shire based clubs and the arrangement of a committee that would eventually become the CSDRFL. All Shire based clubs had previously played in several Inter-District matches throughout the year but with the formation of a localised Sutherland league these were no longer deemed necessary.
The Cronulla-Sutherland Junior District Rugby Football League was formed in 1963 after a general meeting among several of the already established junior clubs whom decided it would be beneficial to form and arrange an annual competition amongst themselves and other teams in the Sutherland Shire. 
Since its inception several new teams have gradually joined the association where the team numbers now stand at a total of sixteen clubs.

Jenkin Coles

Sir Jenkin Coles KCMG (19 January 1843 – 6 December 1911) was an Australian politician, a speaker in South Australia.
Coles was the son of Jenkin and Caroline Coles, came of an old north of Ireland family, and was born at Liverpool, New South Wales. When he was seven years old his family returned to Europe, and he was educated at Christ's Hospital School, London.
Coles' parents came to Australia again in 1858 and settled at Adelaide, South Australia. Coles obtained a position as a junior clerk with the Murray River Navigation office, but gave this up to become assistant dispenser and receiver of stores at the Adelaide hospital for three years. He then joined the mounted police and served for three years in the country. On leaving this service he became an auctioneer and stock salesman and a member of the firm of Coles and Goodchild. The business prospered so much that Coles was able to practically retire from it before he was 40. He was returned to the South Australian House of Assembly as member for Light in 1875, but did not stand at the 1878 election as he found that the strain of carrying on both business and parliamentary duties was too great. In 1881 he was elected for Light, afterwards merged into Wooroora, and represented the district for over 30 years. He was commissioner of crown lands from June 1884 to February 1885, and commissioner of public works from February to June 1885 in the second John Colton ministry and showed himself to be a vigorous administrator. He was commissioner of crown lands again in the Thomas Playford II ministry from June 1887 to June 1889. In 1890 he was elected speaker of the house of assembly in succession to Sir John Bray, and held the position until he resigned, about three weeks before his death of Bright's disease on 6 December 1911. He married in 1865 Ellen Henrietta Briggs, who survived him with four sons and seven daughters. He was created K.C.M.G. in 1894.
Coles was speaker for over 21 years, a record in Australia, and until his last illness never missed a sitting. He had a great knowledge of the standing orders and was firm, tactful, alert and wise. He was thoroughly respected on both sides of the house, his rulings and requests were always obeyed, and under his sway the house of assembly in South Australia established a high reputation for the orderly conduct of its business.

The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether

"The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether" is a dark comedy short story written by American author Edgar Allan Poe.
Plot summary.
The story follows an unnamed narrator who visits a mental institution in southern France (more accurately, a ""Maison de Santé"") known for a revolutionary new method of treating mental illnesses called the "system of soothing." A companion with whom he is travelling knows Monsieur Maillard, the originator of the system, and makes introductions before leaving the narrator. The narrator is shocked to learn that the "system of soothing" has been abandoned recently. He questions this, as he has heard of its success and popularity. Maillard tells him to "believe nothing you hear, and only one half that you see."
The narrator tours the grounds of the hospital and is invited to dinner. There, he is joined by twenty-five to thirty other people and a large, lavish spread of food. The other guests, he notices, are dressed somewhat oddly; though their clothes are well-made, they do not seem to fit the people very well. Most of them are female and were "bedecked with a profusion of jewelry, such as rings, bracelets and ear-rings, and wore their bosoms and arms shamefully bare." The table and the room were decorated with an excess of lit candles wherever it was possible to find a place for them. Dinner is also accompanied by musicians, playing "fiddles, fifes, trombones, and a drum" and, though they seem to entertain all others present, the narrator likens it to horrible noises (at one point even mentioning the torture and execution device known as the brazen bull). Upon the whole, the narrator says, there was much of the "bizarre" about everything at the dinner.
Conversation as they eat focuses on the patients that they have been treating. They demonstrate for the narrator the strange behavior they have witnessed, including patients who thought themselves a teapot, a donkey, cheese, champagne, a frog, snuff, a pumpkin, and others. Maillard occasionally tries to calm them down, and the narrator seems very concerned by their behavior and passionate imitations.
He then learns that this staff has replaced the system of soothing with a much more strict system, which Maillard says is based on the work of a "Doctor Tarr" and a "Professor Fether." The narrator says he is not familiar with their work, to the astonishment of the others. It is finally explained at this point why the previous system was abandoned. One "singular" incident, Maillard says, was when the patients, granted a large amount of liberty around the house, actually overthrew their doctors and nurses and usurped their positions, locking them up as lunatics. These lunatics were led by a man who claimed to have invented a better method of treating mental illness, and who allowed no visitors except for "a very stupid-looking young gentleman of whom he had no reason to be afraid." The narrator asks how the hospital staff rebelled and returned things to order. Just then, loud noises are heard and the actual hospital staff breaks from their confines. It is revealed that the dinner guests were, in fact, the patients who had just recently taken over. As part of their uprising, the inmates had treated the staff to "tarring and feathering." The keepers now put the real patients, including Monsieur Maillard, back in their cells, while the narrator, who is the "stupid-looking young gentleman" mentioned by Monsieur Maillard, admits he has yet to find any of the works of Dr. "Tarr" and Professor "Fether."
The "system of soothing".
Monsieur Maillard's system avoided all punishments and did not confine its patients. They were granted much freedom and were not forced to wear hospital gowns but instead "were permitted to roam about the house and grounds in the ordinary apparel of persons in right mind." Doctors "humored" their patients by never contradicting their fantasies or hallucinations. For example, if a man thought he was a chicken, doctors would treat him as a chicken, giving him corn to eat, etc.
The system was apparently very popular. Monsieur Maillard says that all the ""Maisons de Santé"" of France have adopted it. The narrator remarks that after the patient revolt is crushed, that system is reinstated at the asylum he visits--though modified in certain ways that are intended to reform it.
Historical background.
At the time this story was written, care for the insane was a highly political issue. People were calling for asylum reform because the mentally ill were treated like prisoners, while increased acquittals due to the insanity defense were being criticized for allowing criminals to avoid punishment.
Publication history.
"The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether" was held by editors for several months before finally being published in the November 1845 issue of "Graham's Magazine".

Blackfin tuna

Blackfin tuna ("Thunnus atlanticus") is the smallest tuna species in the "Thunnus" genus, generally growing to a maximum of in length and weighing 21 kg (46 lbs). Blackfin have oval shaped bodies, black backs with a slight yellow on the finlets, and have yellow on the sides of their body. Blackfin are only found in the western Atlantic from Cape Cod to Brazil.
Blackfin hunt both epipelagic (surface) and mesopelagic (deeper water) fish and squid. They also eat crustaceans such as shrimp, crabs, amphipods, stomatopods and the larva of decapods. They are a short-lived, fast-growing species; a 5 year old fish would be considered old. They reach sexual maturity at two years old, and spawn in the open sea during the summer. Blackfin tuna are a warmer-water fish, preferring water temperatures over . What they lack in size, they make up for in numbers and willingness to bite.
Sustainable consumption.
In 2010, unlike other tuna species, Greenpeace International did not add the blackfin tuna to its seafood red list. "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries."

Joseph G. Butler, Jr.

Joseph Green Butler, Jr. (December 21, 1840 – December 20, 1927) was an American industrialist, philanthropist, and popular historian. He is remembered primarily for establishing the first museum in the United States dedicated solely to American art.
Early years.
He was born in the industrial town of Temperance Furnace, Mercer County, Pennsylvania, the son of Joseph Green and Temperance (Orwig) Butler. His family's presence in the country traced back to the period preceding the American Revolution. Joseph G. Butler, Jr.'s Anglo-Irish ancestors emigrated from the vicinity of Dublin to colonial America in 1759. According to Joseph G. Butler, Jr.'s obituary, his father, Joseph Green Butler, was a "widely known iron manufacturer and blast furnace expert". His grandfather, Joseph Butler, established the first blast furnace in central Pennsylvania. When Butler was still a child, his family relocated to Niles, Ohio, where he attended a village school along with future president William McKinley.
Industrial career.
Butler became involved in the iron business at the age of 30. In time, his industrial activities centered on Youngstown, Ohio, where he became a pivotal figure in the community's transition from iron to steel production. In 1892, he joined local industrialist Henry Wick in the organization of the Ohio Steel Company, which built two Bessemer plants along the Mahoning River, just northwest of Youngstown. The company went into production in 1895, only to be sold four years later to the Pittsburgh-based National Steel Company. In 1901, the local plant became the Ohio Works of the Carnegie Steel Company, part of the U.S. Steel Corporation.
Butler's influence extended well beyond Ohio, however. By the early 20th century, he was a nationally known industrialist who served as director of the American Iron and Steel Institute, president of the Portage Silica Company, and a director of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, Pennsylvania & Lake Erie Dock Company, Youngstown and Suburban Railway Company, Pennsylvania and Ohio Power & Light Company, and Commercial National Bank of Youngstown. Among American industrialists, he was known affectionately as "Uncle Joe".
Civic contributions.
Butler's most celebrated legacy is the Butler Institute of American Art, located near the modern-day campus of Youngstown State University. He established the institution in 1919, to house his personal collection of American art. The industrialist's commitment to this groundbreaking museum was reflected in his last will and testament. According to contemporary news accounts, Butler left the bulk of his $1,500,000 estate to the Butler Institute. 
Scarcely more than three decades after Butler's death, "Time" magazine published a feature story which described the art museum as "booming". In a passage that praised the late industrialist's vision as well as its realization, the magazine's editors wrote: "To set the strictly American tone of the place, he planted a befeathered bronze Indian in front of the $500,000 collonaded building designed by the Manhattan firm of McKim, Mead & White. With Youngstown University nearby, the two blocks surrounding the museum soon developed into the cultural strip of the U.S.'s third biggest steel center". 
As a philanthropist and community leader, Butler was also instrumental in the conception and realization of other civic projects, including Niles' National McKinley Birthplace Memorial, a monument to the memory of his personal friend, President William J. McKinley. In addition, Butler was the author of several well-received historical works, including an overview of the development of the U.S. steel industry, a history of the Mahoning Valley, and a biography of President McKinley. His published works also include a volume titled, "Presidents I Have Seen and Known". Butler was personally acquainted with every U.S. president from Abraham Lincoln to Calvin Coolidge.
Death.
Joseph G. Butler, Jr., died on the eve of his 87th birthday. A memorial service held at the Butler Institute of American Art featured a eulogy delivered by Youngstown educator O. L. Reid. The speaker highlighted Butler's rare combination of pragmatism and artistic sensibility when he stated, "His fathers were iron masters and surely in some of them must have been a keen rush of joy before the sheer beauty of the white flame of their furnaces". Butler's funeral services were held at St. John's Episcopal Church, in Youngstown, and his remains were interred at Belmont Park Cemetery, in nearby Liberty, Ohio.

Georgiana Buller

Dame Audrey Charlotte Georgiana Buller, DBE, RRC (4 August 1884 – 22 June 1953), best known as Georgiana Buller, was a British hospital administrator and the founder of the first school dedicated to occupational therapy in the United Kingdom.
Buller was born in Crediton, Devon, the only daughter of General Sir Redvers Buller and his wife, Lady Audrey, youngest daughter of the 4th Marquess Townshend. She joined the British Red Cross Society and by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 she was Deputy County Director of the Voluntary Aid Organisation for Devon. She was asked to establish a hospital in Exeter; by August 1915 the original 160 beds had grown to over 1,400. Established as the Red Cross Voluntary Aided Hospital, in 1915 it was taken over by the War Office as the Central Military Hospital Exeter and Buller remained as administrator, the only woman to hold such a post in a major military hospital during the war. She was also responsible for forty-four affiliated auxiliary hospitals. By 1918 more than 35,000 patients had passed through the hospital. For her work she was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 1920 civilian war honours and also awarded the Royal Red Cross 1st Class (RRC).
After the war, Buller began collecting funds to establish an orthopaedic hospital for children in Devon. In 1927 she opened the Princess Elizabeth Orthopaedic Hospital in Exeter. In 1937 this was followed by the St Loye's Training Centre for Cripples (which later became St Loye's College for Training the Disabled and is now St Loye's Foundation), also in Exeter, and Queen Elizabeth College in Leatherhead, Surrey. She also founded the British Council for Rehabilitation.
Buller died at her home in Exeter from cancer in 1953. She was not married and did not have any children.
"The War Workers".
The character of "Miss Vivian" in E. M. Delafield's "The War Workers" was reportedly based on Georgiana Buller. Delafield was a VAD worker in Exeter and there came to know Miss Buller.

Evarts G. Loomis

Evarts Greene Loomis (1910–2003) was an internationally known homeopathic physician, surgeon, author, lecturer, and visionary who is regarded by some as ""the father of holistic medicine,"" Loomis preferred to be called Evarts rather than ""doctor"".
Origins of holistic approach.
He was inspired to conceptualize holistic medicine while a young doctor working for the Grenfell Mission, which served the fisherman families of Newfoundland and Labrador, traveling by dog sled and boat when necessary. "It was out of the ethers, or perhaps from God, that the words 'Treat the whole man, treat the whole man,' kept flashing through my mind, and they have been with me ever since. For the next eighteen years, I gave much thought as to the practical application of a therapy that would include the physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of illness." Because Evarts grew up in a spiritual, humanitarian, and global environment, he was already naturally applying these concepts at the medical mission. He used prayer and meditation, in particular, in conjunction with his mother Amy and later with other spiritual healers.
Several other factors also contributed to his holistic world view. While working in this northern climate, Evarts had gained extensive surgical experience and was accepted as a fellow in the American College of Surgeons. While he loved surgery, he felt it was too limiting and chose instead to follow a career in family practice, which included surgery, and he became a fellow in the American College of Family Physicians. As an undergraduate at Haverford College, a Quaker school, Evarts read Holism and Evolution 1 by Jan Christiaan Smuts, a South African statesman and soldier. This book also influenced his tendency toward holism. In addition, he was deeply impressed by his philosophy professor, the well-known Quaker mystic Rufus Jones, founder of the American Friends Service Committee.
Early career.
It was at Haverford that Evarts as a third-year biology major happened to pick up a pamphlet about the career of Albert Schweitzer, whose life was dedicated to ameliorating the suffering of natives who had no access to skilled medical care. Evarts was taken by his concepts of ""welt-anschauung"" (world view) and ""reverence for life."" That night, he picked up a phone and informed his parents that he was shifting to pre-med.
World War II intervened before Evarts could begin pioneering a therapy of the whole person. The ""bamboo curtain"" also cut off the dream of Evarts and his wife Verna, an RN, to become medical missionaries in China. Evarts wanted his war service to focus on saving lives, and he served as a surgeon with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Association in Algeria. Bored by a lack of surgical cases, he requested and was assigned by the Friends Ambulance Unit (Quaker) to the bombed-out city of Tenchung, China. There, in a converted ancestor worship temple, he directed a hospital and clinic and, along with an international medical team, treated civilians, as well as Chinese and American military personnel.
After two years, the Quakers turned over the work to the Chinese, and Evarts returned home to his wife and young daughter Margaret, both of whom came into his life while in Newfoundland. Since they had fallen in love with the state while studying Chinese at Berkeley, Verna had already arranged for Evarts to practice in Montebello, California, where their second daughter Laura was added to the family. Evarts also knew he needed a place where new ideas would be more accepted than in the more conservative parts of the US.
Move to California.
While in China, he was impressed with the way the buildings fit into the landscape, and he was already familiar with the healing power of nature. He had seen in his mind a sanitarium located below a triangular mountain peak, and he and Verna began to search for a beautiful setting for their healing center. In 1952, they felt guided to purchase Friendly Hills Ranch in Hemet, California, beneath the spectacular - and triangular - Tahquitz Peak. They began inviting patients to their home for group discussions about what was going on in those patients' lives that might be contributing factors toward illness. They also began forming a non-profit foundation and a board of directors.
Lacking money to construct a center, they eventually purchased Meadowlark, a property once owned by movie magnate Louis B. Mayer. In 1958, America's first holistic medical live-in retreat welcomed its first guest. The following year, Evarts inaugurated a series of three groundbreaking inter-professional conferences to explore the nature of the healing process. Those invited included physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, ministers, scientists, sociologists, business people, an artist, and a spiritual healer. In 1960, Evarts and his family made a trip around the world in search of teachers and advisors to guide his visionary work, since he could find few in the states with whom he could talk about holistic medicine. Twelve years later, he began a major shift from administering drugs to practicing homeopathy, and in 1973 he inaugurated a preceptorship program for medical students.
Meadowlark.
At Meadowlark, Evarts and his staff avoided white coats so they would be indistinguishable from the guests, who stayed an average of two weeks. During the 33 years of operation, Evarts developed a basic treatment program, with the key modality being love. After a thorough medical examination, guests were given nutritional counseling and were encouraged to participate in an exercise program that might include swimming, walking, jogging, or bicycle riding. Guests were served primarily vegetarian food, much of which was grown in an organic garden on the grounds using the biodynamic principles developed by Rudolf Steiner.
In addition to psycho-spiritual counseling, guests could participate in art and music therapy, classes on yoga and meditation, acupuncture treatments, bodywork, biofeedback training, and therapeutic fasts, all of which could lead to a deeper understanding of illness and healing. A favorite activity was the daily group-therapy session where dreams, journaling, and all other modalities were brought together and shared. Guests could always retreat to the interdenominational chapel at any time of the day or night or listen to inspirational tapes in the privacy of their rooms. Meditation was extremely popular, as was the meditation teacher, Amy Loomis, who inspired guests until the age of 98, and still does today through the 52 meditation tapes she created. ""Spirit is where the energy flows, and all the modalities we used at Meadowlark encouraged this healing flow of energy,"" said Evarts.
Bringing exercise to the Meadowlark Program was natural for Evarts, having developed an early interest in birding and hiking. In order to fit in an hour of exercise while studying at Cornell Medical School, he would walk from his aunt and uncle's apartment across New York City's Central Park, while memorizing poetry from such works as Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass. 2 As Evarts began to develop his exercise program, he combined elements from Thomas Cureton's Physical Fitness and Dynamic Health 3 (particularly the Standard Test of Physical Fitness), the Royal Canadian Air Force Plans for Physical Fitness,4 and Dr Kenneth Coopers's Aerobics. 
Evarts was well-grounded in the physical aspects of medicine while studying and training at Cornell, as well as a brief consideration of the new field of psychiatry. On his trip around the world, he visited the Bircher-Benner Hospital and Clinic in Zurich, which influenced his ideas about nutrition and the role of fasting in healing. Evarts also visited Max Bircher, the son of the founder of the famous Bircher-Benner institution. There, at the Landhaus Murpfli, he discovered a model for Meadowlark and expanded his concept of whole-person therapy. Evarts found fasting to be the best method for detoxification in the overall treatment of chronic illness, which was often associated with ingested and environmental toxins. ""Frequently the people who came in with chronic illnesses had been to many other doctors and had exhausted all possibilities of healing, as well as their money. We never charged what it cost to operate Meadowlark and always had to raise funds,"" said Evarts.
American Holistic Medical Association.
In 1977, doctors C. Norman Shealy, Gladys Taylor McGarey, Bill McGarey, and Gerald Looney gathered at Meadowlark to lay the foundation for the American Holistic Medical Association (AHMA), which led to the first conference held the following year in Denver, Colorado. Evarts remembers discussions about the spelling of holistic. "Was it to be with a 'w' or an 'h'? We decided on the 'h', since it is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word 'hal', which is the root of health, whole, holy, and heal, and is thus more inclusive."
At the time of Meadowlark's 25th anniversary celebration in 1983, Dr. Shealy, founding president of AHMA, designated Evarts as the "father (and grandfather) of holistic medicine" and stated that Meadowlark had served as a role model for most of the people in the holistic movement. In 1995, Evarts received the AHMA Pioneer Award, which recognizes outstanding contributors to the holistic health movement. Previous recipients include Dr Linus Pauling and Bill Moyers. Evarts is also a founding diplomat of the American Board of Holistic Medicine (ABHM), which offered its first exam in conjunction with the University of Colorado Medical School in 2000. Evarts, with Rev. J. Sig Paulson, authored one of the first books on holistic medicine, Healing for Everyone: Medicine of the Whole Person6, a classic work on the art of medicine, which is in its second paperback reprinting. He also wrote a biography of his mother and most important spiritual teacher, entitled Amy, The Search for the Treasure Within 7 and published excerpts from her manuscript ""Lessons for the Aquarian Age"" under the title, To Self Be True 8. In addition to writing books and articles, Evarts filmed many of the European teachers he met on his world trip. His film, Healing the Whole Person 9, includes the only images of the ""father of psychosynthesis,"" Roberto Assagioli, MD.
Later life.
As executive director of Meadowlark, Evarts and his staff treated more than 6,000 guests before finishing his pioneering work in 1991. The overall program had considerable success in treating arthritis, cancer, and other chronic illnesses. For many years, Evarts was also a tireless international lecturer. He spoke at the first meeting of the British Holistic Medical Association, and while he and his wife Fay Loomis, MA, were lecturing in Calcutta, India, they were asked to help inaugurate the Indian Holistic Medical Association. Evarts and Fay were married in 1992, after Verna's death. Holding an MD, FACS, FACP, and ABHM, Evarts has served on several boards, been interviewed on radio and television, and received numerous honors. His most recent honor occurred at the 25th Silver Anniversary of the AHMA when 25 medical pioneers were recognized, including doctors Deepak Chopra, Larry Dossey, Christiane Northrup, Rachel Naomi Remen, and Bernie Siegel.
Today Evarts and Fay jointly counsel, write, and lecture. As Evarts recently approached his 93rd birthday, he expressed his gratefulness at being able to influence and witness a therapy of the whole person (body, mind, and spirit), which has gone through the pains of birth and adolescence and found its fruition in a specialty board-the ABHM. Evarts has summarized his life experiences and his vision for the future of medicine in his forthcoming book, "Return of the Priest-Physician: Medicine for the 21st Century" (Loomis, EG, to be published).
Legacy.
Holistic practitioners, authors of books on holistic modalities, and those who have benefited from holistic treatment are all indebted to Evarts' unwavering pioneering spirit, his vision of holism, and his ability to synthesize it into a working model. For several years he struggled alone, in spite of criticism from traditional medicine—and even attempted arrests—to provide a template which is now rivaling mainstream medicine. Perhaps most important of all, he has lived the model that he created.
"No one I know or know about so truly deserves to be termed 'pioneer' in this movement," said Willis Harmon, late president of the Institute of Noetic Sciences. "When I first met Dr Loomis in the late 1950s, he had just started Meadowlark, and his philosophy and practice of holism impressed me as applying not only to medicine, but to all of life. Very few people at that time could foresee the revolution against reductionism, fractionalism, and positivism that began in the 1960s. Evarts not only saw the issues clearly, but created an influential demonstration of what the new way would mean in terms of 'health for the whole person.'"
Evarts G Loomis's great-grandmother was Mary Evarts, was a sister of former United States Secretary of State, Attorney General and Senator William Maxwell Evarts.

David S. Sheridan

David S. Sheridan (10 July 1908, Brooklyn – 29 April 2004, Argyle, New York) was the inventor of the "disposable" plastic endotracheal tube.
David was the second of six sons of Adolf and Anna Sockolof, who immigrated to the United States from Russia. He changed his name from Sockolof to Sheridan in 1939. He attended school until 8th grade when he went to work with his father and brothers in the hardwood flooring business. 
David Sheridan was the inventor of the modern "disposable" plastic endotracheal tube now used routinely in surgery. Previous to his invention, red rubber tubes were used, then sterilized, and re-used which often lead to the spread of disease and also a high risk of infection. Sheridan is thus credited with saving thousands of lives.
He held more than 50 medical instrument patents and is credited with inventing the modern disposable catheter in the 1940s. In his lifetime he started and sold four catheter companies and was dubbed the "Catheter King" by Forbes Magazine in 1988. 
Sheridan died in New York at the age of 95.
