Philip Denwood

Philip Denwood is a British Tibetologist noted for his work on traditional Tibetan arts and handicrafts, Himalayan architecture and Tibetan linguistics.
He was born on August 29 in 1941 in Workington, Cumberland where he also grew up. In 1962 he gained his BA in Geography and History at University College London (UCL), and later in 1964 an MA in Architecture and Town Planning from Liverpool University. He became a research Fellow in Tibetan at SOAS in 1965 and became Lecturer in Tibetan in 1973. 
Denwood describes his interest in Himalayan cultures as purely accidental. Having completed his study at Liverpool and based in England, Denwood was living next door to a friend of his from college David Snellgrove. Snellgrove had not long returned from a trip to the Himalayas and had brought five Tibetan refugees back with him around the time of the first wave of exiles post 1959. Denwood's intrigue about the situation with his friend's house guests, coupled with his interest in oriental architecture inspired him to join Snellgrove on an overland trip to India he had been planning. They drove a landrover to Nepal together, (which they later sold to a Bhutanese army officer,) and Denwood stayed there learning Tibetan while Snellgrove went ahead to South India. When Snellgrove returned to Nepal, Denwood joined him once again and they drove to Bhutan. The trip lasted a year in total and learning the Tibetan language had prompted Denwood's interest in linguistics. 
When he returned to England, Denwood landed the training post of Research Fellow of Tibetan at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (SOAS), where he was eventually appointed as a lecturer.
During his time learning Tibetan in Nepal, Denwood had observed the lack of material available for learning the language, and found the native approach to teaching too unscientific. His budding interest in linguistics brought about his own analysis of the language, learning also from Richard Keith Sprigg who at the time was teaching in the SOAS Linguistics department. This study culminated in the writing of his own book of Tibetan grammar, titled; 'Tibetan'. 
Denwood's interest in Tibetan handicrafts he again describes as accidental. The SOAS library had sent him to Delhi, India on a placement for 6 months. He traveled with his wife and two young children. Having been introduced to the Tibetan community there he became familiar with the carpet trade. It was his wife who decided to learn how to weave a carpet, whilst Denwood wrote a book about the process. 
Denwood retired from teaching at SOAS in 2006.

It was built between 1820 and 1855 in neoclassical style by the architects Angel Chavez, Juan De Velasco, Ramón Ortés De Velasco and Manuel Arana. The birth of Florida is dated 1820 when they built the existing ring that surrounds the music kiosk. For the actual 32,454 square meters land used the former convent of Santa Clara, and as much as planners have insisted later, there is nothing similar in the new green spaces in Vitoria.
The park is oval and is crossed by two main roads that divide it into quadrants. The roads are perpendicular to each other and intersect in a large circle at the middle of this space. In this circular space is a metal kiosk built in 1890. Each of the squares of the area is bordered by low walls of carved sandstone, which also have small crossed rail-shaped arches.

This bandstand was created in 1820 and renovated in 1855, located in center of the Florida park has witnessed the evolution of Vitoria through the years. Nowadays it has several functions, as spring arrives there are concerts which older people can enjoy ore in summer when the White Virgin's days are celebrated there are many activities as concerts or plays. The townhall used to put the ice rink in the bandstand at winter but, these year it has been moved to the Wihte Virgin's square.
The botanic garden.
La Florida, in addition to being a privileged Vitoria lung and a place for meetings and appointments, keep a special representation of these giants that have achieved huge steps in an urban environment, something that makes them even more special .

Love Rendezvous

Love Rendezvous is the fourth single from the album Bizarre Fruit/Bizarre Fruit II by British band M People. Written by Mike Pickering and Paul Heard and Heather Small. Produced by M People. It was released on 14 October 1995, after the band's World Tour. The song peaked at number thirty two on the UK Singles Chart.
Background.
Since the release of the last single four months previously, the band had relentlessly continued a World Tour, played to sell-out Summer festivals in the UK, in Belgium and Sweden. They then created a new radio and master mix for this, their fourth single and a new track (the band's live favourite) a cover of The Small Faces' Itchycoo Park. Like Search for the Hero, the band re-edited the funky Bizarre Fruit version of Love Rendezvous to create a more radio-friendly pop version with the additional trademark sax ad-lib. This would delay the release of the single which was originally pencilled in for 18 September 1995 but pushed back two weeks. This left them time to prepare for a re-release of the already double platinum album to a deluxe edition called Bizarre Fruit II which would feature the same tracks as before, with new artwork and the new radio edit of tracks: Search for the Hero and the new master mixes of Love Rendezvous and Itchycoo Park as well as an additional second 'Live and Remixed' CD.
Composition.
The new version of the song very much captured the signature M People dance sound and a return to form from the softer more serious side of the band as heard on Search for the Hero; dancey piano chords, pure stomping house beats and layers of synths and bleepery. 
Lyrically, Heather sings about the arranged meeting with a lover, away from everything else and sees the band in a much more fun and carefree pop mood, straying away from the usual 'love yourself, respect yourself' themes. She also namechecks singers Patti Smith (#"Patti sang horses.."#) and Stevie Wonder (#"…Stevie Got uptight"#).
The newer version of this single also features a funky sax break in the middle eight and also during the choruses. What remains from the original are the underlying keyboard sequences in the bridges up to the choruses. The backing vocals are strong and fun and use the insistent refrain #"Uptight. Outta Sight"# as mentioned on Stevie Wonder's 1966 song: Uptight (Everything's Alright) adding to the song's spirit of fun.
M People backing vocalist, Paul Johnson also gets a more prominent role singing alongside Snake Davis's funky sax ad-lib during the middle eight.
Chart Performance.
There was an aura of mild disappointment when the single showed no sign of entering the Top 30 in its week of release. It entered the chart at a lowly number 33 with sales of 21,000 copies in its first week to 23,000 copies in its second, causing it to climb one place to peak at number 32. Although, it was the fourth consecutive M People single to climb the chart in its second week, it did break the band's eight consecutive Top 10 single run. In the third and fourth week it slid down the chart to number 52 and then to 70, spending just 4 weeks on the chart. This was the lowest selling single from the album Bizarre Fruit and the lowest chart position since Colour My Life charted at number 35, some three years prior, in 1992.
Airplay.
Generally, radio support began typically supportive to the single when it was serviced to radio on 25 September 1995, Search for the Hero had become a firm Airplay favourite across Europe, but in The UK, it was still in the lower echelons of Top 75 some four months on.
In the four weeks prior to airplay Love Rendezvous entered the chart at No. 75, scaling to number 36 and then moving to number 23 and then to 15. Only after physical release, did the single's airplay seem to stall and peak at number 9, despite heavy support from Dance stations: 
Kiss and Galaxy who were heavily rotating the K-Klass Klub Mix (Radio Edit)'.
UK Radio Station's indifference to the song was compounded by the lower Sales chart placing which meant it spent another four weeks falling swiftly out of the chart. It did however continue the band's run of 9 consecutive Top Ten airplay hits.
Formats/Remixes.
This single was the second M People single to be available on two CD formats following the success of Open Your Heart earlier that year. 
The formats were given a staggered release like Open Your Heart. CD1 and the cassette were released on 2 October 1995, CD2 was released on 9 October 1995 and the 12" was released on 16 October 1995. 
The two CDs all feature the radio and master mixes of the single. CD1 contains the 'Uno Clio Dub Mix' and the US Remix of Search for the Hero by 'Dave Jam' Hall which was released too late to make it onto the last single. CD2 has two further mixes by K-Klass the 'Klub Mix' and 'Pharmacy Dub'.
Artwork.
The artwork for the single on CD1 is of a bunch of beautiful, colourful and extravagant flowers wrapped in paper enscripted with the band's name and title of the single. CD2 is simply a close-up view of the wrapping paper for the flowers without them featured. Both are set against a purple background.
Live.
The band have not performed this single since the Bizarre Fruit Tour and subsequent 'Summer M Parties' of 1996, this is the only single to have not been performed since it release and it was also the only single to not be performed at The Best of M People concert in 1998 despite appearing on the accompanying The Best of M People album release in the same year. When released on the second 'Best of'… compilation: "Ultimate Collection" (M People album) was released in 2005, the band still left it off the set list on that year's tour.
Music Video.
The video was filmed over two days on Friday 25th and Saturday 26 August 1995 while the band were on the South American leg of their World tour. Director Matthew Amos and Producer Laura Kanerick and the 'Medialab' crew filmed their live show at Citibank Hall which was then known as the "Arena Metropolitan" in front of 6,500 fans.
(who had embraced the frequently used Latin sound of the band) on the first day and on the second day of shooting, the band were filmed out together amongst the Rio people and their natural beauty. Mike, Paul and Shovell are photographed together in the sunshine and there are deliberate footballing references and Heather sings separately by day and night amongst some beautiful locations including the Rio Botanical Gardens. 
The general theme also features some couples kissing and others running across the city's streets to meet and embrace. There are also views of other great Rio landmarks including the packed and bright yellow trams and Christ the Redeemer, the world's largest Art Deco statue.
Other promotion.
After returning from their World Tour which had followed a summer of performing at Festivals in Ireland, Scotland's T in the Park, Switzerland and then covering America, Australia and the Far East, the band returned home to work on the deluxe issue of the parent Album: Bizarre Fruit, which had already gone double platinum, selling in excess of 600,000 copies. Although the band gave the single limited promotion, support from Music video channels was strong but the release date was pushed from 16 September 1995 back a whole month.
The video was premiered exclusively and in full on ITV's The Chart Show on Saturday 30 September 1995.

Career.
Dejan Đenić started his career in his hometown club FK Remont Čačak in the 4th league. In his first season he accomplished promotion with the club to the 2005-06 Serbian League West, 3rd League. In the winter break of that season he moved to Slovenia but he will only play one match for the club in the Slovenian First League. In summer 2007, still young, he went to the Netherlands and played six months with the B squad of SC Heerenveen before returning in winter to Serbia to play the rest of the season with FK Novi Pazar in the Serbian First League, second national division. While playing there he became a standard player having for the first time the chance of playing 16 league matches in half season. This didn't went unnoteced, and an ambitious club from Azerbaijan, Standard Baku signed him that summer, in 2007. However next winter he was back to Serbia and helped the Vlade Divac backed club FK Sloga Kraljevo to be promoted to the Serbian First League. Next summer he moved again, this time to Montenegrin First League club FK Jedinstvo Bijelo Polje. But this will also be a half season spell, since he moved next winter to Poland to play with Ekstraklasa historical club ŁKS Łódź. That year was not successful for the club and at the end of the season they were relegated. Đenić however stayed this time, but after six months playing in Polish second level he returned to Serbia and signed with FK Bežanija that was playing in Serbian second level. This proved to be good for him since he managed to score 6 times in 11 league matches thus calling the attention of the Serbian SuperLiga clubs. The most persistent was FK Jagodina and signed him in summer 2010.

Geography.
Although it is sometimes referred to as "Cordillera Prebética", it is not a proper cordillera, or continuous alignment of ranges, but a broken system of mountain ranges.
Unlike the other two subsystems of the Baetic System, it is not present in the western area, but begins west of the eastern edge of the Sierra Sur de Jaén near Martos. 
The Prebaetic System runs along eastern interior Andalusia, across the Region of Murcia, reaching the Mediterranean Sea shores in the southern Valencian Community. 
Its highest point is La Sagra, Sierra de la Sagra; other high ranges are Sierra de Segura and Sierra de Cazorla.
The Sierra de María in northern Almeria Province runs across the Prebaetic and the Penibaetic System, overlapping with both.
Geology.
Geologically the Prebaetic System shares similar characteristics to its parent system, the Subbaetic System and it is considered its eastern offshoot. The materials that compose it were formed in a relatively shallow sea.
The Iberian System rises north of the eastern part of the Prebaetic System.
Main mountain ranges.
Some of the mountain ranges that make up the Prebaetic complex are, from west to east:

Languages of Libya

The "de facto" official language of Libya is Modern Standard Arabic. The majority of the population, about 95%, has one of the many varieties of Arabic as native language, most prominently Libyan Arabic, but also Egyptian Arabic, Tunisian Arabic and other varieties.
Minority languages.
Besides Arabic, several Berber languages are spoken as well by ca. 305,000 speakers, the most significant group is concentrated in the Tripolitanian region ; Nafusi and Zuwara. It is also spoken in some oasis such as Ghadamès, Awjilah, Sawknah. Tamahaq is spoken by the Tuaregs.
In addition, Domari, an Indo-Iranian language is spoken by ca. 33,000 speakers and Tedaga, a Saharan, by a few thousands.
The former dictator Muammar Gaddafi has denied the existence of Berbers as a separate ethnicity, and called Berbers a "product of colonialism" created by the West to divide Libya. The Berber language was not recognized or taught in schools, and it was forbidden in Libya to give children Berber names.
After recent uprisings in Libya, the National Transitional Council (Revolutionaries) has shown an openness towards the Berber language. The independent Revolutionaries "Libya TV", has included the Berber language and its Tifinagh alphabet in some of its programming.
Foreign languages.
English is the most notable foreign language in business and for economical purposes and also spoken by the young generation. Moreover, there are thousands of young Libyan professionals who were educated in universities in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Italian is still known to some degree by some old people, mainly in the form of Libyan Italian. After the Libyan civil war and the help coming from France, the French language started for the first time to be popular among the young generation. For that reason France will encourage the teaching of the French language in Libya.

Boeung Kak lake development.
Despite a land law in 2001 passed by the Royal Government of Cambodia recognising land titles if proof of residence for five continuous years can be shown, residents of Boeung Kak were denied land titles. Later in the same month of February 2007, the Phnom Penh Municipality and Shukaku Inc. signed a $79 million 99 year lease agreement for over 133 hectares of prime real estate including Boeung Kak and the surrounding land affecting around 4,225 families. David Pred, co-founder of Bridges Across Borders claims that "The lease is illegal because the lake is state public property and cannot be leased for more than 15 years or damaged or destroyed...by filling in the lake, it will be destroyed.” 
On 26 October 2008, Shukaku Inc began filling the lake with sand causing flooding and the collapse of some houses. Water and electricity was cut.
In September 2010, over 1500 affected families were forced to accept compensation for their homes and land well below the market value. Yim Sokhom, an army commander claims that representatives of Shukaku Inc. offered a reimbursement of 4000 for his property though similar properties around Phnom Penh would sell for over 40,000
Many former residents of the lake villages now live in slums surrounding the lake. The overcrowded nature of these newly formed slums has led to serious health concerns.

Spratt Model 107

__NOTOC__
The Spratt Controlwing 107 was an unorthodox controlwing flying boat designed in the United States in the 1960s and marketed for home building in the 1970s. 
The aircraft featured a flat, speedboat-like hull with a square bow and with tailfins blended into each side. The fins were angled to form a butterfly tail and included no moving surfaces. The wings were mounted on struts, parasol-style, and also contained no moving surfaces. Rather, each of the two wings could pivot independently to vary their angle of attack. The pilot and a single passenger sat side by side in an open cockpit with a converted marine outboard motor mounted behind them that drove a pusher propeller. The flight controls consisted of a helicopter-style collective that varied the angle of attack of both wings simultaneously, and a control wheel that varied their angles of attack in relation to one another. The hull was constructed from polyurethane foam and covered with fiberglass, and the wing panels were fiberglass throughout. 
Designer George Spratt claimed that the Model 107 could not stall or spin, and that it was 75% less affected by turbulence than a conventional airplane design. With friend Elliot Dalland, Spratt began construction of the prototype (registered "N2236") in 1962. During the 1970s, Spratt marketed plans for the Model 107 to homebuilders.

Greeks in Hawaii

Greeks in Hawaii or Helene were one of the earliest westerners, "Haole"s, to Hawaii and known for being one of the few White ethnicities to be opposed to the Overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy.
Early contact.
The earliest Greeks had come to Hawaii after Captain James Cook, at latest with Captain George Vancouver’s expedition. Into the 1830s subsequent Greeks came as whalers and traders. The Russian Orthodox Church was established in 1839 in which Greek Orthodox Christians attended. To Hiram Bingham I of the ABCFM, he held a certain degree of approval that the Greeks were at the minimum Christians, but the missionary community would learn to loathe the Greeks. In 1850 princes Alexander Liholiho and Lot Kapuāiwa met Greek Minister Spyridon Trikoupis in Paris who encouraged them to join him in drinking and gambling, against Gerrit Judd’s objections.
Later establishment.
In the 1870s Greeks began to emigrate because of famine and over-population in Greece for labor on Hawaii’s sugar plantations. A few entrepreneurial Greeks came in the 1880s to Hawaii formed a tight community and gave jobs to fellow countrymen at their businesses. The ABCFM missionaries had since become a group of wealthy elite and the disdain for the Greeks had increase. William Alexander described Greeks as “commercial, ingenious andeloquent, but deceitful, dirty and immoral.” Among the immigrants was Peter Camarinos who joined as co-partner of Campbell, Marshall, and Company. Camarinos was sued by A. J. Campbell for $6,750. Paul Neumann defended Camarinos and had the suit dismissed. This was followed up by two countersuits. After the suit the new Greeks of the community avoided the Missionaries and instead acquainted themselves with the Monarchs. The Greeks came to compete against the Missionaries in the export and pineapple industries. Further disapproval by the conservative missionaries was their tendency to attend and hold parties which included King David Kalākaua. Moreover was the hospitality industry which provided drinking, music, and partying.
Overthrow of the Kingdom.
As the missionaries tuned to aggression the political situation became increasingly unfavorable to the Greeks.
On June 30, 1887 the a Missionary group called the Hawaiian League forced the bayonet constitution on King Kalākaua. In 1891 King Kalākaua died and his sister, Queen Liliʻuokalani, ascended the throne. On January 17, 1893 Queen Liliʻuokalani was overthrown by businessmen and the Missionary elite. 
George Lycurgus was arrested and fined for disturbing the peace and distributing alcohol without a liquor license. He elieved the ulterior motive for his reprimand was for his support of the monarchy. His brother, John, had difficulties obtaining license for various industries. Under the new government Hula was banned and public concerts of Hawaiian Music were outlawed. But private performances of Hawaiian Music were legal and George Lycurgus hired the National Band to play at his hotel, "Sans Souci", to the annoyance of pro-government supporters.
The Greeks took part in opposing the Provisional Government and Republic. A number joined the counter-revolutionaries plotting to restore the monarchy. Hawaii’s Schuetzen Club was taken over by German, Austrian, Greek, and British royalists and transformed into a front organization to train counter-revolutionaries.
The uprising was put down swiftly and royalists were captured and arrested including some Greeks, of which two were exiled.
Killing of Peter Camarinos.
Significant to the small Greek community at the time was the dead of Peter G. Camarinos. Camarinos had been considered the most aggressively in favor of the counterrevolution, a major planner and sponsor of the insurgency he stated “I will give half that I am worth to see the damned Missionary sons of bitches hung”.
By 1896 Camarinos had allegedly become mentally ill, his friends and family supported him and had him admitted to Andrews Asylum for the Insane in California. One year later he was dead, the asylum physician conclude he had died of paresis. Camarinos’ family received his body in an advanced stage of decomposition two or three days after he had died. His family accused the asylum of purposefully using the decay to concealing bruises that implied that he had been kicked and beaten to death. John R. Griffith, who had been admitted to the asylum for dementia, witnessed Camarinos complain about his breakfast, then attack an attendant named John Lynn and then attack a nurse. Two other attendants intervened and threw Camarinos to the ground and held him down as Lynn jumped onto Camarinos’ stomach repeatedly until Camarinos fainted. 
A critic of the Republic suggested the killing was ordered by Sanford B. Dole and William O. Smith to eliminate an enemy and make an example of Camarinos for opposing the Republic.

Abraham Pandithar

Rao Sahib Abraham Pandithar (, August 2, 1859 – August 31, 1919) was a Tamil musicologist and a traditional medicine practitioner from Madras Presidency, British India.
Biography.
Abraham Pandithar was born in Sambavar Vadakarai in Tirunelveli district to Muthusamy Pandithar and Annammal of the Maruthuvar Family. He studied at the CVES Normal Teachers Training School at Dindigal and in 1876, became a teacher in the same college. He belonged to a family of doctors and became interested in Siddha medicine. In 1879, he went to Suruli hills to research herbs growing there. There he met the Siddhar Karunandhar and became his student. After completing his studies he went to Tanjore and worked as a Tamil teacher in Lady Napier Girls School. His wife Gnanavadivu Ponnammal was the headmistress in the same school. In 1890, he left his teaching job to do research on medicine full-time. He started a farm outside Tanjore for growing medicinal plants. He named it Karanandhapuram after his teacher. It was called as Pandithar thottam (Pandithar's farm) by the locals. He also started a clinic - the Karunanidhi Medical Hall at his residence in Tanjore. In 1909, the colonial government awarded him the "Rao Sahib" title. In 1911, Gnanavadivu died and Pandithar married Bhagyammal.
The publication of "Silapathikaram" by U. V. Swaminatha Iyer in 1892, made Pandithar interested in Tamil music and he started studying it. He learnt traditional music from Sadayandi Bhattar and western classical music from Tanjore A. G. Pichaimuthu pillai. He did extensive research on the origins and form of Tamil music. He established the "Sangeetha Vidhyalaya Mahajana Sangam" - a music association and organised six music conferences during 1912–1914. In 1917, He published his research into Tamil music as "Karunamirdha Sagaram", a 1346 page book, that remains a seminal work in the field till today. He also published "Karunamirdha Sagara Thirattu" - a collection of Tamil practice songs (musicians of that period trained using Telugu songs). He also translated several "Keerthanais" into Tamil. He attended the All India Music Conference held at Baroda in 1916 and presented his research there. 
Pandithar died in 1919. His family continued his research - His son Varaguna Pandiyan Pandithar wrote the Tamil musical research work Paanarkaivazhi and his daughter Maragathavalli Duraipandian Pandithar completed part 2 of "Karunamirdha Sagaram". His grandson D. A. Thanapandian Pandithar is also a musician and musicologist. In 2008, the Government of Tamil Nadu nationalised his works.
Medicine and traditional toxicology.
Ezhavas were also involved in weaving and some practised traditional medicine.. The Chekavar, a warrior section within the community, were part of the militias of local chieftains and kings.
Some Ezhavas had an extensive knowledge of the medicinal value of plants, passed to them by their ancestors. Known as Vaidyars, these people acted as physicians. Itti Achuden was probably the best known Ezhava physician who directly influenced the classification of Hortus Malabaricus in the 17th century. Itti Achuden's texts were written in the Kolezhuthu script that Ezhava castes used, for they were prevented from learning the more sanskritized Aryazuthu script which was the preserve of the upper-castes.
Some Ezhavas are often quoted as having practiced ayurvedic medicine, which actually is Siddha medicine as Kerala was earlier a part of the extended Tamil Nadu and Ayurveda was beyond the reach of the 'lower' castes.

Percival Wilkinson

Percival Wilkinson (1848 to c. 1891) was a rugby union international who represented England in 1872 against Scotland in his only appearance for the national side.
Early life.
Percival Wilkinson was born in Hampstead, London, the son of William Martin Wilkinson, a solicitor of 44, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London and his wife, Elizabeth, who hailed from Derbyshire. Percival's uncle, his father's brother, was the Swedenborgian writer J. Garth Wilkinson. The legal profession was deeply rooted in the Wilkinson family, with Percival's grandfather James John Wilkinson (died 1845), having been a writer on mercantile law and a judge of the County Palatine of Durham. Of Percival's two older brothers, Edward and William, the latter went into their father's firm and of Percival's two younger brothers, Charles and Hugh, the latter trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn. Percival himself was at school locally, and then by 1871 was an articled clerk to an attorney. 
He married Constance Vallance Stratford Bell in 1878, and his son Cuthbert was 
born in 1880. 
In 1881 Percival Wilkinson he was still a solicitor in London, but died sometime before 1891.
Rugby union career.
As a rugby player he was listed as belonging to the Law Club. This was a closed club for members of the legal profession, hence his position in an attorney's firm qualified him. He also played rugby at halfback for Harlequins, his local club that when he first played for them was known as The Hampstead Football Club, but changed its name in 1870. However, when selected for England, his team was given as Law FC because, according to one source, Harlequins were not well known enough at the time. His international debut, and only appearance, was on 5 February 1872 in front of 4,000 spectators at The Oval in the England vs Scotland match. This was the second time the teams had met and in fact the second international match, as well as being the first time England had hosted an international rugby match. England won the match, a reversal of the previous year's result in Scotland.

Heritage conservation in Canada

Heritage conservation in Canada deals with actions or processes that are aimed at safeguarding the character-defining elements of a cultural resource so as to retain its heritage value and extend its physical life. Historic objects in Canada may be granted special designation by any of the three levels of government: the federal government, the provincial governments, or a municipal government.
The Heritage Canada Foundation acts as Canada's lead advocacy organization for heritage buildings and landscapes.
Federal level.
The most obvious way the federal government becomes involved with heritage conservation is through the National Historic Sites of Canada. Plaques are erected by Parks Canada and the site is listed in the Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada. Only National Historic "Sites" commemorate buildings, there are also plaques for National Historic "People" and National Historic "Events". However National Historic Site designation provides no legal protection for the buildings on the site. Heritage management of federal buildings is handled by guidelines from the Federal Heritage Building Review Office. These guidelines are often ignored by other federal departments and has led to calls by groups such as the Heritage Canada Foundation for legislation to protect federal buildings. The only other direct protection provided to buildings by the federal government are that of "Heritage Railway Stations" (because railways are federally regulated). and "Heritage Lighthouses", through the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act passed in 2008.
Provinces.
Each provincial government has distinct systems and approaches to heritage conservation. They may delegate the authority to preserve historic buildings to municipalities, and / or have a provincial heritage register.
For example in the province of Alberta, only sites owned by the provincial government and run as a functioning historic site or museum are known as Provincial Historic Sites or Provincial Historic Areas. Buildings and sites owned by private citizens and companies or other levels or branches of government may gain one of two levels of historic designation, "Registered Historic Resource" or "Provincial Historic Resource". Historic designation in Alberta is governed by the Historic Resources Act. The province also lists buildings deemed historically significant by municipal governments on the Alberta Register of Historic Places, which is also part of the larger Canadian Register of Historic Places although this does not imply provincial or federal government status or protection. To supplement this system, the province also run the Alberta Main Street Program which helps to preserve historic buildings in the downtowns of smaller communities. The basis for the preservation system in Alberta is the Heritage Survey Program, which is a survey of 80,000 historic buildings in Alberta which lack a protected status but are documented for possible future protection.
In Quebec, the Répertoire du patrimoine culturel du Québec is the main heritage register, it includes both protected and unprotected properties. The Conseil du patrimoine religieux du Québec is a non-profit organization created in 1995 to promote the conservation of churches and other religious heritage buildings in the province.
Municipalities.
Cities, towns, counties and other local government in Canada may use zoning and other bylaws to restrict the demolition of individual historic buildings or districts. They may maintain a municipal heritage register, such as Edmonton's "Register of Historic Resources in Edmonton". The city of Vancouver uses a traditional heritage register and a new system called a density bank, under which developers are rewarded for preserving and restoring heritage buildings by being awarded exceptions to restrictions (usually height restrictions) on other sites they own.
In Montreal, one of Canada's oldest and most historically rich cities, the Le Conseil du patrimoine de Montréal advises the municipal government on matters related to heritage building preservation. A pair of non-governmental groups have worked to preserve Montreal historic buildings since the 1970s: Save Montreal, co-founded by Michael Fish in 1974, and Heritage Montreal, founded by Phyllis Lambert two years later. In October 2009, Lambert, Heritage Montreal and others formed a think tank called the Institut de politiques alternatives de Montréal to advise the city on a range of matters including urban planning, development and heritage.
Government approach to policy.
Two of the primary conservation tools in Canada are the Canadian Register of Historic Places and the "Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada". This document was the result of a major collaborative effort among federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments, heritage conservation professionals, heritage developers and many individual Canadians. A pan–Canadian collaboration, it is intended to reinforce the development of a culture of conservation in Canada, which will continue to find a unique expression in each of the jurisdictions and regions of the country. In the document, conservation approaches are broken down into three categories: Preservation, Rehabilitation, and Restoration. As published in the "Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada", these conservation approaches are defined as follows:
Preservation: the action or process of protecting, maintaining, and/or stabilizing the existing materials, form, and integrity of a historic place or of an individual component, while protecting its heritage value. Preservation can include both short-term and interim measures to protect or stabilize the place, as well as long-term actions to retard deterioration or prevent damage so that the place can be kept serviceable through routine maintenance and minimal repair, rather than extensive replacement and new construction.
Rehabilitation: the action or process of making possible a continuing or compatible contemporary use of a historic place or an individual component, through repair, alterations, and/ or additions, while protecting its heritage value.
Restoration: the action or process of accurately revealing, recovering or representing the state of a historic place or of an individual component, as it appeared at a particular period in its history, while protecting its heritage value.

<doc id="31198987" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31198987" title="Angel St">
Angel St

"Angel St" (pronounced Angel Street) is the thirteenth single by British band M People, released on 16 March 1998. "Angel St" is the third and final single from M People's 1997 album "Fresco". The song was written by Mike Pickering, Paul Heard and Heather Small and produced by M People and Chris Lord-Alge. The song peaked at number eight on UK Singles Chart.
Background.
Last single Fantasy Island despite its nine-week sojourn in the sales chart Top 75, peaked and stalled at number 33 even with above average radio airplay, Never Mind Love the mid-temp soulful third track on the album was rumoured to be the third single release, but a more typical sounding single was chosen in the form of seventh track and Fresco live favourite Angel St. A brand new mix was created by Chris Lord-Alge for the single with lighter sounding synths to support the resounding M People virtues of believing in yourself, respecting yourself but with a leaning towards greater independence.
Special mention must be given to the Later with Jools Holland Special filmed at BBC TV Centre in February 1998 and features the full M People band, helped out with a 10 piece Gospel Choir including regular backing singers, Lynieve Austin, Paul Johnson, and Sarah Brown, a 12-piece String Section as well as Mr Jools Holland himself on piano during the performance of Angel Street itself and later on Don't look any further. They performed some all-time classic M People songs, a couple of lovely acoustic arrangements and one very special cover of Gladys Knight's 'Baby Don't Change Your Mind'. In the UK, it was screened on BBC2 twice over the Easter Holidays, at 11.30pm on Good Friday and repeated at 6pm on Easter Monday. The Video and DVD of the performance were later sold on general release.
Composition.
The single utilises the skills of consistent (unofficial, fifth) band member Snake Davis who opens the songs with a prolonged sax riff lasting seven seconds accompanied by the drums and layers of percussive shakers and a neat underlying rhythm guitar riff, and grand piano played by Terry Burrus who also played on last single, Fantasy Island. Also, the London Session Orchestra provides reinforced orchestral support on the bridge and choruses arranged by Simon Hale. The song very much continues in the familiar vain of Fantasy Island capturing both the signature M People sound and luxuriating in lifting the spirit with pace, drive and eternal messages of the need for both self-reliance and co-operation.
Formats & Mixes.
This single was the third M People single to be available on two CD formats, following "Open Your Heart" and "Love Rendezvous" to ensure strong sales and strengthen the bands chanced of getting their tenth Top 10 hit. Unlike the previous two single CD format releases, all formats were released on the same day. CD1 contains the radio edit and live mixes of "Sight for Sore Eyes", "One Night in Heaven" and "Search for the Hero" which were all recorded from the Fresco Tour the previous autumn (in Glasgow, Manchester and London respectively). CD2 contains both the radio edit and album versions as well as two further mixes: the Joey Negro Extended Disco Mix which is a slice of 70s funk, and 'Genius 3's Out in the Sticks' vocal mix which band member Shovel provides the percussion for.
Chart Performance.
After the distinct disappointment in the chart performance of "Fantasy Island", the band heavily promoted the single and in the week of release only there were very strong contenders released in the same week including: Destiny's Child's "No, No, No", Robbie Williams's "Let Me Entertain You", and Tin Tin Out's "Here's Where the Story Ends", all vying for top ten chart places with Angel St.
The single entered the chart well within the Top 10 and had been ahead of nearest competitor Tin Tin Out's smash hit "Here's Where the Story Ends" for most of the week but had to settle one place behind it at number 8. Angel St became M People's tenth and final top ten hit, their second number eight hit from the album and their third number eight single in total, after How Can I Love You More (Mixes) and Just for You.
The single received average support from radio in the UK and the two CD format clearly spurred the single to sell very well in a very strong sales week, with other songs in the Top ten including many former number ones: the Spice Girls' "Stop", Madonna's "Frozen" and Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On", but leading atop the chart at the time was 1998's biggest selling single Run DMC's "It's Like That".
Angel St sold 74,500 copies to enter the chart and peak at number 8 with the live CD (1) selling more than the remixed CD(2). The single then moved very steadily out of the chart in the following weeks from 8 to 15 to 25 to 38 to 46 to 63, so it stayed in the chart for six weeks in total in the Spring of 1998.
Airplay.
For the first time since Excited in October 1992, some six years prior, and some twelve consecutive singles later, radio seemed quite reluctant to play the single and rotate it. Even lesser charting sales singles, like Fantasy Island received more immediate airplay. Generally, radio support for the single grew slowly, despite being serviced to radio in the middle week of January 1998, some eight weeks before release, which is traditionally a very quiet time for single releases. Capital Radio group at first played added to the single to their C-list and it didn't move to tier A-list until a week after release once the single proved itself to be a sales success. Even die hard supporters like BBC Radio 2 made it their Single of the week, in the week of release, but hadn't played it much before. Stations seemed to be wary of the single on the back of the surprise stalling in sales of Fantasy Island.
The single entered on airplay at number 75 four weeks before release moving to 52 to 40 to 21. It then peaked at number 14 the week after their tenth top sales hit placing but only hung around the top twenty for three weeks, making made this single their lowest charting airplay hit since 1992. However, while airplay was relatively slower than normal, the music channels heavily rotated the video particularly VH1, MTV and The Box.
Artwork.
The artwork for the single is a stylised photograph of lead singer, Heather Small sat on a backless leather sofa all dressed in black jacket, black trousers, hair flowing over her right shoulder in the direction to which she is smiling and looking with looking glamorous and relaxed with pristine make up. The photograph was taken by Kevyn Aucoin, the very highly in demand American make-up artist and photographer who had worked with hundreds of celebrities including Cher, Janet Jackson and Tina Turner. CD2 is a close-up of half of Heather's face, chest and shoulder as seen from CD1, and you can see even more clearly the flawless make-up on Heather's face. The sleeve was designed by Farrow Design, who had designed both previous singles' sleeves as well as the parent album's sleeve Fresco.
Music Video.
The video was filmed over two days and fully exploits the 'Tour' theme as it was shot at Manchester's Nynex Arena on: 11/12 December 1997, on their Fresco tour and both celebrates and encapsulates the 185,000 people who went to the tour. The opening shot is of the Arena floor, empty and filling up over time-lapse sequencing and Heather and the band are seen performing live on stage and during soundcheck. The band are seen to be very relaxed in rehearsals and Heather sings wearing a long black coat rehearsing the song and the stark contrast between rehearsing and performing live. However in performance she commands the stage wearing a long pink high cut dress marching across the stage as she sings.
The first opening shots and timelapses are primarily seen through the lens of the stage camera which moves across the front capturing everything from the enjoyment of the crowd to the band clowning around in rehearsals. Other montages of images, capture everything from the band in their hotel lobby at Christmas, to street signs with 'Angel Street' and ones leading to Manchester and backstage antics, meet and greets with fans, to tour bus jokes and lots of dancing on stage by Heather. The crowd are seen in their thousands within the arena dancing and clapping and singing along with their hands in the air. The montages emphasise how much fun the band have on the road touring, the stage being set up as well as seeing band members Mike Pickering, Paul Heard and Shovel enjoying themselves on stage as well as the other backing singers and members of the live band.
As the video draws to a close, the final clips show the end of the concert and the band waving goodbye as they leave the stage. The closing shots show the crowd disappear and the stage crew packing up on the now empty arena floor.
Other promotion.
Apart from the Later with Jools Holland Special show mentioned earlier, they also relentlessly promoted the single on The Des O'Connor Tonight Show, This Morning, Sunday Night at the London Palladium, Videotech, Cilla Black's Surprise Surprise, The Pepsi Chart TV Show and of course, their seventeenth Top of the Pops appearance. The band went on to promote the album in Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Holland and Belgium throughout March and into April 1998.
Live.
During the Fresco Tour, when this song was premiered, it quickly turned into a new crowd pleaser with its natural sing-along chorus and often opened the show. It very much exploits the musical saxophone talents of Snake Davis who opens the song with a jazzy riff holding the note for an even longer 11 seconds. He also in the middle eight performs the 'battle of the saxes' with Mike Pickering also on sax, when Mike repeats what Snake plays and latterly after the Best of performed 'the battle' with whoever would be playing rhythm guitar.
The live version has always stayed pretty faithful to the original with a funkier groove and the additional of rhythm guitar underlying the song throughout; Shovel on percussive duties alternating between playing Bongos and Tambourine, Paul plays chords on second keyboards and Paul Birchall plays first keyboard in place of the grand piano parts originally played by Terry Burrus on the track.
The band also premiered the song on UK TV, live on Later with Jools Holland when they were a featured artist in November 1997 promoting the Fresco album and performed other tracks, Never Mind Love and Heather's solo performance of: Perfect Day. They also opened with this song on the Jools Holland M People Special in the Spring of 1998.
After the Fresco Tour, Angel St has always been played quite early in their setlist, but no longer the opener and is very much a warm-up track for bigger singles like One Night in Heaven. The track is also concluded by Snake who plays the song out to a natural end with a closing outro.

The Last Eichhof

The Last Eichhof is a freeware shoot-'em-up game released for MS-DOS in 1993 by Swiss company Alpha Helix. The player controls a beer bottle and destroys bottles belonging to rival beer companies. There are 5 levels; between each level, the player is given a chance to buy extra bottles, each with their own shooting projectiles.
Graphics and fonts by "Tweety". Code and levels by "Tritone". Additional programming and music by "Zynax".
Much of the music in "The Last Eichhof" comes from the songs "Schnaps Bonus" and "Bring me Edelweiss" by the pop band Edelweiss. The instrumental from the Pink Floyd song, "Money" plays during this stage where you can sell beer bottles. Many sound effects were samples taken from the TV sitcom "Parker Lewis Can't Lose".
Gameplay.
The object of the game is for the player to shoot cork projectiles out of the beer bottle/s and destroy as many enemies to gain as many litres of brew as possible (the game's score is tallied in terms of litres, instead of the usual points). Not only does the amount of brew collected boost the player's score but it also provides money needed to buy supplies from the pub. In most of the levels, waves of mugs, bottles and tankards will attack the player followed by minibosses (usually crates and rival beer logos) and occasionally big bosses. In one of the levels, the player is faced by hostile champagne bottles, dahquiries, tequilas, martinis, Jack Daniels, and Bourbon. Most of the enemies have an alcohol theme. In one of the levels, the enemies are items associated with hangovers: alarm clocks, coffee pots, toilets, Alka-Seltzer, Aspirin. However, there are a few enemies in the game which do not have any alcohol-related theme (Windows logo, Pac-Man, MacIntosh apple logo, toaster screensaver).
The main beer bottle must be protected and avoid enemies, otherwise a life is lost. If all lives are lost the game is over. Bottles that accompany the main beer bottle cannot ever be destroyed. Once a level has been completed, the player stops by at the pub to buy extra bottles of beer to assist the main beer bottle. Four standard bottles (Stange, Pony, Barbara Braeu and Dunkel) can be purchased from the counter and many others (Can 33CL, Chuebeli, Pokal, Xenon 2 Cannon, plus Bonus Guttere for lives and Speed can be purchased from the Menu Card. Up to six bottles can accompany the main beer bottle. After each level, the place has the choice of selling the bottles for a small reduction of what they first cost.
Note that levels 2-5 have checkpoints. So if the main beer bottle is hit, the player restarts at the last checkpoint successfully passed instead of restarting at the beginning of the level.

Bioliquids

Bioliquids are liquid fuels made from biomass for energy purposes other than transport (i.e. heating and electricity).
Bioliquids are usually made from virgin or used vegetable and seed oils, like palm or soya oil. These oils are burned in a power station to create heat, which can then be used to warm homes or boil water to make steam. This steam can then be used to drive a turbine to generate electricity.
Rudolf Diesel's first public exhibition of the internal combustion engine, that was to later bear his name, ran on peanut oil.
Bioliquid production and use.
Bioliquids have been used for many years to provide heat for homes on a small scale but now big energy providers are looking at their use on a larger scale.
A controversial plant in Bristol (UK) was recently given the go ahead despite receiving several hundred complaints. The plant will be built and operated by W4B and provide enough power for 25,000 homes.
Advantages.
Bioliquids have several key advantages over other sources of renewable energy:
Disadvantages.
Many of the same problems that affect biofuels also affect bioliquids and there are various social, economic, environmental and technical issues, which have been discussed in the popular media and scientific journals. These include: the effect of moderating oil prices, the "food vs fuel" debate, poverty reduction potential, carbon emissions levels, sustainable biofuel production, deforestation and soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, impact on water resources, as well as energy balance and efficiency.
Bioliquids also have several key problems compared to other sources of renewable energy:

Healthcare in Croatia

Croatia has a universal health care system, whose roots can be traced back to the Hungarian-Croatian Parliament Act of 1891, providing a form of mandatory insurance of all factory workers and craftsmen. The population is covered by a basic health insurance plan provided by statute and optional insurance and administered by the Croatian Institute for Health Insurance. In 2009, annual healthcare related expenditures reached 20.6 billion kuna (2.75 billion euro). 
Healthcare expenditures comprise 0.6% of private health insurance and public spending. In 2010, Croatia spent 6.9% of its GDP on healthcare, down from approximately 8% estimated in 2008, when 84% of healthcare spending came from public sources. Croatia ranked around the 50th in the world in life expectancy with 73 years for men and 79 years for women, and it had a low infant mortality rate of 6 per 1,000 live births.
There are hundreds of healthcare institutions in Croatia, including 79 hospitals and clinics with 23,967 beds. The hospitals and clinics care for more than 700 thousand patients per year and employ 5,205 medical doctors, including 3,929 specialists. There are 6,379 private practice offices, and a total of 41,271 health workers in the country. There are 63 emergency medical service units, responding to more than a million calls.

Shadow government (conspiracy)

The term shadow government (also cryptocracy), besides its party political meaning, also refers to what is sometimes called "the secret government" or "the invisible government," an idea based on the notion that real and actual political power does not reside with publicly elected representatives (for example, the United States Congress) but with private individuals who are exercising power behind the scenes, beyond the scrutiny of democratic institutions. According to this belief, the official elected government is in reality subservient to the shadow government who are the true executive power.
History.
Conspiracy-oriented literature postulates the existence of a secret government who are the true power behind the apparent government. Examples of such literature include works by Dan Smoot, William Guy Carr, Jim Marrs, Carroll Quigley, Gary Allen, Des Griffin, David Icke, Michael A. Hoffman II and John Coleman. Some of these authors believe members of the secret government may represent or be agents for groups such as the Council on Foreign Relations, the Royal Institute for International Affairs, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, CIA and MI6 in co-operation with international banks and financial institutions such as the World Bank and the Bank for International Settlements. Also popularizing the idea was the hit US television show, "The X-Files".
Milton William Cooper claimed that the shadow government was in cooperation with extraterrestrial aliens. His 1991 book "Behold A Pale Horse" ., influential among "UFO and militia circles", describes "the doings of the secret world government" and "a variety of other covert activities associated with the Illuminati's declaration of war upon the people of America". Cooper claimed to have seen secret documents while in the Navy describing governmental dealings with aliens. Cooper linked the Illuminati with his beliefs that extraterrestrials were secretly involved with the US government, but later retracted these claims. He accused Dwight D. Eisenhower of negotiating a treaty with extraterrestrials in 1954, then establishing an inner circle of Illuminati to manage relations with them and keep their presence a secret from the general public. Cooper believed that aliens "manipulated and/or ruled the human race through various secret societies, religions, magic, witchcraft, and the occult", and that even the Illuminati were unknowingly being manipulated by them.
Cooper described the Illuminati as a secret international organization, controlled by the Bilderberg Group, that conspired with the Knights of Columbus, Masons, Skull and Bones, and other organizations. Its ultimate goal, he said, was the establishment of a New World Order. According to Cooper the Illuminati conspirators not only invented alien threats for their own gain, but actively conspired with extraterrestrials to take over the world. Cooper believed that James Forrestal's fatal fall from a window on the sixteenth floor of Bethesda Hospital was connected to the alleged secret committee Majestic-12, and that JASON advisory group scientists reported to an elite group of Trilateral Commission and Council on Foreign Relations executive committee members who were high-ranking members of the Illuminati.
In his novel "Coningsby", Benjamin Disraeli stated that "The world is governed by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes". One definition of a shadow government is a "secret government within the government". This secret government is the "real" government that controls the legitimate and visible government's agenda. The network of people constituting this secret government are bound by some common agenda known only to each other and/or the people they represent. The agenda may be that of a secret society who have infiltrated the government (examples include Freemasons, Skull and Bones men or Illuminatists). In this case the agenda of the network is known only to those members who are bound by an oath of secrecy.

Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus

Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus () commonly known as Celsus (ca. 45 – before ca. 120) was an Ancient Greek Roman citizen who became a Roman senator, and served as a Roman consul in 92 and governor of Asia (105–107). Celsus Polemaeanus was a wealthy and popular citizen and benefactor of Ephesus, and was buried in a sarcophagus beneath the famous Library of Celsus, which was built as a mausoleum in his honor by his son Julius Aquila Polemaeanus.
Biography.
He was born ca. 45 to a family of Greek origin in either Ephesus or Sardis. His family were priests in Rome and were originally from Sardis in Asia Minor. They had been granted Roman citizenship, and some of them held official positions in the service of the Roman Empire. In 69, during the Year of the Four Emperors, when Celsus was launching his equestrian career, he and his legion acclaimed Vespasian emperor. After Vespasian solidified his control of the Empire, he rewarded Celsus by raising him to the senatorial class. Celsus went on to hold the highest position open to Roman senatorial aristocrats, becoming suffect consul in 92. In 105, he was named proconsular governor of the Roman province of Asia by the Emperor Trajan.
Library of Celsus.
The Library of Celsus in Ephesus was built to honor Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus after his death. He paid for the library from his own personal wealth, and bequeathed a large sum of money for its construction which was carried out by his son Julius Aquila Polemaeanus. The library was built to store 12,000 scrolls and to serve as a monumental tomb for Celsus. The library is both a crypt containing his sarcophagus and a sepulchral monument of Celsus. The library collapsed after Ephesus was deserted but it was restored by an Austrian Archaeology Foundation in the 1970s.

Shear strength (discontinuity)

The shear strength of a discontinuity in a soil or rock mass may have a strong impact on the mechanical behavior of a soil or rock mass. The shear strength of a discontinuity is often considerably lower than the shear strength of the blocks of intact material in between the discontinuities, and therefore influences, for example, tunnel, foundation, or slope engineering, but also the stability of natural slopes. Many slopes, natural and man-made, fail due to a low shear strength of discontinuities in the soil or rock mass in the slope. The deformation characteristics of a soil or rock mass are also influenced by the shear strength of the discontinuities. For example, the modulus of deformation is reduced, and the deformation becomes plastic (i.e. non-reversible deformation on reduction of stress) rather than elastic (i.e. reversible deformation). This may cause, for example, larger settlement of foundations, which is also permanent even if the load is only temporary. Furthermore the shear strength of discontinuities influences the stress distribution in a soil or rock mass.
Shear strength.
The shear strength along a discontinuity in a soil or rock mass in geotechnical engineering is governed by the persistence of the discontinuity, roughness of discontinuity surfaces, infill material in the discontinuity, presence and pressure of gasses and fluids (e.g. water, oil), and possible solution (e.g. karst) and cementation along the discontinuity. Further the shear strength is dependent on whether the discontinuity has moved before in the geological history (i.e. are the asperities on opposing walls of the discontinuity "fitting" or "non-fitting", or have the asperities been sheared off).
Determination shear strength.
Only for simple models of discontinuities the shear strength can be analytically calculated. For real discontinuities no analytical calculation method exists. Testing on various scales in the laboratory or in the field, or empirical calculations based on characterizing the discontinuity are used to establish the shear strength.

Sheriff's March

The Sheriff's March was an annual procession at Gateshead Fell, County Durham.
Medieval Britain operated under a strict feudal system. Society was rigidly structured in a pyramidal form with the King (or Queen) at the apex as the highest authority in the land, ordinary citizens at the bottom with a variety of Lords, Bishops, Judges and other noblemen and landowners ranking variously in between. Allegiance and subservience to the Crown was required by all men and women at all times and on most occasions was demonstrated by the swearing of oaths. Once such occasion occurred twice a year, when the Sheriff of Northumberland met with the Crown Judges who came to Newcastle upon Tyne and sat on the Assizes to hear any legal matters which required their attention. To further emphasise the importance and solemnity of these visitations, a procession was to be held prior to the official meeting of the parties.
At an inquisition at Tynemouth in 1278, it was duly declared that the King of Scotland, the Archbishop of York, the Prior of Tynemouth, the Bishop of Durham and Gilbert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus should arrange to meet with the justices prior to their entry into Newcastle, provided that they came through the county of Yorkshire first.
On the appointed day, usually a Saturday, the procession of these learned men would take place, starting in Newcastle upon Tyne before crossing the River Tyne and passing into Gateshead. After a short refreshment break, the procession then made its way slowly up the old (and remarkably steep) turnpike road until all concerned parties came to the designated meeting place. This was initially established at "Chile Well", but latterly the procession came to "light and go into the house".
The house in question was "Ye Olde Cannon", located on the turnpike road at the crest of Gateshead Fell. This place was chosen because of the convenience of both the gentry of Northumberland and for the judges journeying from Durham and it was there that wine and punch were again served to the members of the precession at the expense of the Sheriffs who would wait there until the judges made their arrival. Once they had done so, all would return to Newcastle upon Tyne.
It is not known for certain whether or not Chile Well was situated on the old turnpike road, but it is certainly possible that the two meeting points were one and the same place. A well was for many years situated across the road from the Cannon and this certainly lends credence to the possibility that the sites were, in fact, the same. Intriguingly, the well was inscribed:
""As cold waters to a thirsty soul<br>So is good news from a far country.""
This procession took place for over five hundred years, even continuing after the English Civil War in the seventeenth century had effectively destroyed the feudal system as the principal means of rule in Britain. Indeed, the procession was held until 1825 when, upon the completion of the far less steep turnpike road through Low Fell, the procession was rerouted and the meeting place became The New Cannon situated at the junction between the turnpike road and the Low Fell Road (now Beaconsfield Road and Belle Vue Bank).
In 1832, miners at the Sheriff Hill Colliery went on strike in protest of pay and the dangerous conditions at the colliery. When the Sheriff's March reached the area of Gateshead Fell, they were confronted by angry workers carrying a banner depicting a rat taking cheese from the working men Shortly after, a Commons bill in 1838 abolished such processions and so the tradition was halted and the travelling dignitaries had to be accommodated at the expense of their hosts. An attempt to revive the procession in 1845 by the High Sheriff, Ralph Carr Elison, was largely abortive and no further attempt was made.
It is as a direct result of the "Sheriff's March" that the area around Ye Olde Cannon and the old turnpike road became known as Sheriff Hill.

Ken Grimley

Ken Grimley (born 7 February 1936) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Fitzroy in the Victorian Football League (VFL).
Grimley was a rugby league full-back while growing up in Brisbane and only took up Australian football after leaving school. He started out in the Wilston Grange junior team but soon broke into the seniors and in 1955 played in the club's first ever QANFL premiership. The following year he was the league's top goal-kicker with over 100 goals.
He spent just one season at Fitzroy, having been invited to the club by officials he met during an exhibition game in Brisbane. In just his second appearance, but first full game, Grimley kicked six goals from full-forward against Geelong at Kardinia Park.
After he returned to Wilston Grange in 1958 he is credited as having convinced the club to adopt a Gorilla as their logo, which Fitzroy had changed from the previous year. Grimley, who also played as a ruckman, switched to Coorparoo in 1959 and played grand finals in his first six seasons at the club. He was the runner-up in the 1961 Grogan Medal but won it in 1964. The early 1960s also saw him play many of his 22 interstate appearances for Queensland and the state was undefeated under his captaincy in 1963 and 1964.
A son, Brett Grimley, also played with Fitzroy, to create the first instance of a Queensland father and son combination playing in the VFL.
In 2003, Grimley was named as the ruckman in the official "Queensland Team of the Century", next to rovers Michael Voss and Jason Akermanis.

2nd Avenue Lofts

The 2nd Avenue Lofts is a historic building located in the Central Business District of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.
The original building on the site was a five story concrete and steel building with a pressed brick facade building constructed in 1913, to house the J.F. Cairns Department Store. J. F. Cairns settled in Saskatoon in 1902, opening the first mill in the city before entering the retail business. The five story building was built by "G.H. Archibald and Company" containing 90,255 square feet. The building was taken over the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) department store chain in 1922 making it the 11th department store location for HBC. On October 14, 1922, the Chippendale style, "Imperial Restaurant" opened on the fourth floor, the restaurant contained banquet facilities and was used for special events in the city.
The original building was torn down and in 1960 the Hudson's Bay Company opened in a new more modern three story building on the same site. At a cost of $3 Million the building provided of retail space over three floors and had provision for the addition of two more floors. In 1967, a fourth floor was added as well as a skywalk to a six floor parkade. In 2000, HBC left the building to move into the former Eaton's location in Midtown Plaza (Saskatoon) shopping centre a few blocks away.
In 2004, Wayne Lemauviel, Gary Bender and later Gene Dub purchased the building and began work on converting the building into lofts. A fifth story was added to the building, and due to the high ceiling on each floor it was possible to create each loft with an internal mezzanine. The ground floor was retained as retail space. The same year, the skybridge across second avenue was removed and the parkade torn-down. The interior design on the building has won an Award of Excellence. The conversion from retail to lofts is part of a larger residential revival occurring in the central business district with an influx of people moving into the area.

Persistence (discontinuity)

Persistence determines the possibilities of relative movement along a discontinuity in a soil or rock mass in geotechnical engineering. Discontinuities are usually differentiated in persistent, non-persistent, and abutting discontinuities (figure).
Persistent discontinuity.
A "persistent discontinuity" is a continuous plane in a soil or rock mass. Shear displacement takes place if the shear stress along the discontinuity plane exceeds the shear strength of the discontinuity plane.
Non-persistent discontinuity.
A "non-persistent discontinuity" ends in intact soil or rock. Before movement of the material on both sides of a non-persistent discontinuity is possible, the discontinuity has to extend and break through intact material. As intact material has virtually always far higher shear strength than the discontinuity, a non-persistent discontinuity will have larger shear strength than a persistent discontinuity.
Abutting discontinuity.
An "abutting discontinuity" abuts against another discontinuity. Abutting discontinuities might continue at the other side of the intersecting discontinuity, however, with a displacement to give so-called ‘stepped planes’. Shear displacement along the discontinuity can take place if the shear strength along the discontinuity plane is exceeded, and the blocks of material against which the discontinuity abuts can move or break.
Anistropic persistence.
A discontinuity might be persistent in dip direction but be not persistent perpendicular to the dip direction or vice versa.

<doc id="31199415" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31199415" title="Geology of Taiwan">
Geology of Taiwan

Taiwan is active geologically, formed on a complex convergent boundary between the Yangtze Subplate of Eurasian Plate to the west and north, the Okinawa Plate on the north-east, the Philippine Plate on the east and south, and the Sunda Plate to the southwest. Subduction changes direction at Taiwan.
The upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of terranes, mostly old island arcs which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the Eurasian Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate, which is moving to the northeast. These have been further uplifted as a result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was subducted beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust under Taiwan more buoyant.
South of Taiwan, the Philippine Sea Plate is subducting under the Sunda Plate, forming the Luzon Volcanic Arc (including Green Island and Orchid Island). The east and south of the island are a complex system of belts formed by, and part of the zone of, active collision between the North Luzon Trough portion of the Luzon Volcanic Arc and the Eurasian Plate, where accreted portions of the Luzon Arc and Luzon forearc form the eastern Coastal Range and parallel inland Taitung Longitudinal Valley of Taiwan respectively.
To the northeast, the Philippine Sea Plate is subducting under the Okinawa Plate, forming the Ryukyu Volcanic Arc.
Terranes.
The Haian Range (海岸山脈) or Coastal Range terrane belongs to the Luzon Volcanic Arc (呂宋島火山弧), and is on the Philippine Sea Plate (菲律賓海板塊). West of this is the Longitudinal Valley or Huatung Valley (花東縱谷), an active depositional zone in a rift valley. West of this is the Eastern Central Range terrane, part of the continental base that has been upturned. The western side of the range is the Western Central Range terrane, which is metamorphosed earlier Tertiary clastic sediments. The Lishan Fault separates the Hsuehshan Range terrane Eocene to Oligocene sandstone and shale. The Chukou Fault (觸口斷層) provides the boundary for the Western Foothills terrane, which is shallow marine detritus from Miocene to Pleistocene. A deformation front forms the boundary with the undeformed coastal plains alluvium, which is still depositing.
The Eastern Central Range terrane can be divided into the Tailuko belt on the west with greenschist metamorphism and the Yuli belt on the east with blueschist metamorpism. The two metamorphic belts are possibly separated by a fault called Shoufeng fault, but this is unproven.
Central Mountains.
The oldest exposed rocks are heavily metamorphosed and found in the Central Mountains. Poor quality fossil evidence suggests an origin in the Permian Period. They form a band of rock from Nan'ao in the north to inland of Jinfeng on the eastern flank of the Central Mountain Range. The band is 30 km wide in the north and narrows to the south. These earlier rocks are heavily metamorphosed. They also occur as a basement beneath the western part of the island. They make up the Danana'ao Group or Tananao Schist. This group consists of the Kainanagang Gneiss, Tailuge Marble, and Changchun Schist.
The Yuli Schist is Cretaceous in age and consists of black schist and some greenschist, glaucophane schist, and spotted slate. It is the easternmost part and extends from Chian southwards to the west of the Chihpen hot springs in a belt about 150 km long. Although the dark colour of the black schist is due to carbon, carbon is less than 2% of the content. The minerals found are quartz, mica, chlorite, albite, sphene, and graphite.
The Changchun Schist being mostly Greenschist is found on the western side and forms thick beds. It is found along with smaller amounts of chert, and black schist. The rock is foliated dark green rock containing chlorite, epidote, quartz, calcite, biotite, albite, and actinolite. They are derived from mafic volcanic rocks. These rocks can host copper sulfide ores.
Siliceous schists are coloured grey, they are metamorphosed sandstone, rich in quartz. Quartzite and chert bands can be found, and they are commonly associated with the black schist.
The Chiuchu Formation or Tailuge Marble forms a band from Tailuko in the north to a point between Wulu and Kuanshan in the south. The limestone is mined in quarries south of Suao for cement manufacture. Although the colour is usually a shade of grey, there are also black or white limestone, which is chopped into blocks for building purposes. Dolomite is also found along with the limestone particularly at Chingchangshan, Hopingchi, and Mukuashan.
The Kainangan Gneiss or Kanagan Formation occurs in several elongated bodies. The gneiss derived from sedimentary rocks is coarde grained quartz, biotite, and albitic plagioclase. There is also orthogneiss derived from granite. This is light grey and contains sodic plagioclase, quartz, biotite, and muscovite. Within the gneiss there are pegmatite dikes containing quartz, feldpsar and mica.
Other igneous rocks found in the old metamorphic belt are amphibolite and dolerite dikes. Serpentinite is found 5 km west of Fengtien (奉天). It contains exploited deposits of nephrite, talc and asbestos. Wanjung Station (萬榮) is close to more outcrops of serpentenite. Tamayenshan block northwest of Juisui (瑞穗) and the Tsenghuanshan block 10 km west of Juisui are significant ultramafic outcrops.
Green serpentinite from near Yuli makes a good quality building stone. A band of ultramafic rocks extends for 25 km north of Litao, Taitung (離島).
The area was subjected to the Nanao Orogeny around 85 Ma which involved the granite intrusion and regional metamorphism. Rifting that opened the South China Sea around 40 Ma may be connected with some dolerite intrusions. The Penglai Orogeny started about 10 Ma and continues at the present time.
Eastern stratigraphic region.
The most recently added part of the island is the Coastal Range on the east coast from Taitung City in the south to Hualien City in the north. The range is the continuation of the Luzon arc. The age is Neogene and the rock consist of melange and volcanicalstics. The rock units are firstly Chimei Volcanics Miocene andesite. Next is Tuluanshan Formation, consisting of tuff, then Takangou Formation, consisting of sediments such as shale and sandstone that contain volcanic particles. The Lichi Formation consists of melange. It is made of mud containing blocks of other stone such as sandstone and ophiolite. It is found on the southern half of the west side of the Coastal range. When this erodes, badlands are formed. Because it is a mixture of stone, the Lichi Formation is hard to date, but is likely to be from Pliocene.
The Pinanshan conglomerate is found on Pinanshan Hill and along the Pinantachi stream north of Taitung (台東). The constituents are 5–15 cm cobbles erodes by freshwater from the Central Range. It formed somewhere from middle to late Pleistocene, and indicates the plate collision had taken place.
The Milun Conglomerate is to the north of Hualien. This has also gone under the names of Beiron Conglomerate Formation and Milunpi Conglomerate. It is tilted at 30°. It is undated but is likely from Pleistocene.
Central Mountains strata.
Shibachongxi Formation is from the Eocene consisting of slate and then beds of metamorphosed sandstone. The total thickness is up to 1000 m.
Dajian Formation consists of sandstone from the upper Eocene, up to 2700 meters thick.
Xichun Formation slate and phyllite is from the lower Oligocene. The thickness is from 0.6 to 3 km.
Siling Formation coarse sandstone in thick beds is from the Oligocene.
Shuichungliu Formation form the Oligocene contains argillaceous slate and graywacke.
Bilushan Formation contains slate and phyllite from the Eocene.
Lushan Formation from the Miocene contains shale slate and sandstone.
Aodi Formation contemporary
Sule Formation slate and sandstone from the later Miocene.
Western stratigraphic region.
The west part of the island exposes deformed and metamorphosed Cenozoic sediments, overlaid by Quaternary piedmont region in the flat plains on the west coast.
Cretaceous, Paleocene and Eocene deposits are not exposed on the surface, but are buried. They have been discovered by drilling.
The Yunlin Formation is from the Cretaceous and only known from boreholes. The rocks are siltstone, basalt, shale and limestone.
The Paleocene Wangong Formation consisting of volcaniclastics, sandstone, shale and limestone is over 1046 meters thick.
In the Eocene the Shuangji Formation formed mostly from volcanic particles in the form of tuff and tuffaceous sandstone. These beds are from 100 m to 3 km thick.
In the Oligocene the Wuzhishan Formation or Wuchihshan Formation (五指山組) formed thick beds of sandstone. The total thickness is 0.9 to 1.2 km.
Yeliu Group from Miocene is fine grained sandstone, with some beds of shale, basaltic tuff and three seams of coal. Possibly including Wushan Formation, Piling Shale, Peiliao Formation, Talu shale, Shihti Formation, Kuanyiongshan sandstone.
Ruifang Group contains beds of sandstone, siltstone, shale and six thin coal beds. These beds are 0.8 to 1.6 km thick.
Sangxia Group starts with medium grained sandstone, but in the upper layers increases shale. Eight thin coal seams are included. The total thickness of the deepest beds exceeds 5 km. This includes Kueichulin Formation with Yutengping Sandstone, Shihliufen Shale, Kuantaoshan Sandstone; the Nanchuang Formation including Shangfuchi Sandstone and Tungkeng Formation.
The Jinshui Formation or Chinshui Formation from the Pliocene is mostly shale interbedded with some mudstone and sandstone is between 80 and 400 m thick.
The Zhuolan Formation or Cholan Formation (卓蘭層) starts in the Pliocene and extends into the first stage of the Pleistocene. It consists of fine grained sandstone. This is 1.5 to 2.5 km thick.
At the same time on the southern tip of the island, the Kending Formation or Kenting Formation (墾丁組) was formed consisting of mudstone with ophiolite melange. The ophiolite melange contains pebbles and blocks of Miocene age consisting of basic and ultrabasic rock from the ocean floor. The interpretation is that a wedge of seafloor was pushed above sea level, eroded and dropped fragments into the mud.
The Toukoshan Formation (Toukeshan) (頭嵙山層) commenced with fine sandstone with thin beds of conglomerate, and continued into mainly conglomerate with sandstone beds. This was formed in stage 1 and 2 of the Pleistocene. It is from 0.4 to 3 km thick.
Szekou Formation is a light bluish gray siltstone, with shale and fine grained sandstone. The Maanshan Formation is very similar. It is overlain by Hengchun Limestone and may interfinger.
Western piedmont region.
The Hengchun Limestone was formed after the Penglai movement in the third Pleistocene stage. Also at this time laterite (紅土) and gravel on river terraces was formed. Holocene mud sand and coral form a wide belt on the west side of the island.
Volcanic rocks.
The Tatun mountain volcanics are found on the northern tip of Taiwan. Chihsingshan is the highest point of the volcanoes at 1120 meters. The volcanoes have formed the rounded shape of the northern cape of Taiwan. The volcanic rock also occur on Huaping Isle, Mienhua Isle, Pengchia Isle and Huangwei Isle just to the north of Taiwan. The rocks are aluminium rich andesite, tuff and breccia. The rocks are poor in sodium and magnesium, but rich in iron, potassium, rubidium and strontium and strong in rare earth elements. The magma was derived by melting of the underthrust sea plate behind the Ryukyu Volcanic Arc during the Pleistocene.
The Caolingshan Basalt consists of olivine and pyroxene, with crystals of biotite and plagioclase. This is rich in K Rb Mg Sr Cr Ni, but poor in Na Al and Fe. Rare earth elements are strongly enriched. The magma was derived by deep mantle melting of the underthrust sea plate behind the Ryukyu Volcanic Arc during the Pleistocene.
The volcanoes on Chilungshan (基隆火山群), Penshan, Caoshan, Chilung Island (Keelung Islet) and Gueishan Island date from the Pleistocene period and later. The eruption were explosive tholeiitic andesite and dacite. The main mineral is calcium rich plagioclase. The magma source is the western extremity of the Ryukyu Volcanic Arc (琉球火山弧) formed when the subducting Philippines Sea Plate was compressed below the edge of the Eurasian Plate at about 20 to 30 km deep. The magma was contaminated with continental crust material. Geochemistry of the rock shows that iron, aluminium, titanium, potassium, rubidium and strontium are enriched, but sodium, magnesium and nickel are impoverished.
Alkaline volcanic rocks from north west Taiwan are found at the Shihmen Reservoir, Chiaopanshan, Taoyuan and Fuxing. The rocks are picrite, alkaline basalt and trachyandesite. The commons minerals are albite, olivine, clinopyroxene and oxides of iron and titanium. The elements enriched are sodium and titanium, and magnesium and calcium are reduced. The rock dates from the Miocene. The magma was formed under tension conditions on the continental margin from deep down in the mantle.
Volcanoes on the Coastal Range and Green Island erupted tholeiite andesite, and volcanic explosive fragments. The volcanoes erupted from the Pliocene to Pleistocene period. It is part of the Luzon Volcanic Arc. Magma was formed from underthrusting oceanic crust under compression about 25 km deep. The andesite rock contains some visible crystals of pyroxene or amphibole. The geochemistry of the rock shows it is enriched in potassium, strontium and rubidium and light rare earth elements. Chromium and nickel are depleted. The Chimei Volcanic Complex, near the Hsiukuluanchi river, has an age from 9 to 22.2 Ma. It is associated with copper porphyry mineralisation. It covers an area of 22 km2.
Pleistocene basalt and tholeiite is found in the Penghu Islands. The lava erupted from fissures in a flood. The rock is enriched in titanium and poor in aluminium, rubidium and strontium. The alkaline basalt contains olivine and analcite. The tholeiite contains plagioclase and pyroxene. The magma originated in the upper mantle under tension conditions on the continental margin.
Tectonics.
The Philippines Sea Plate is converging with the continent at 7 cm per year in the west north west direction. It has compressed Cenozoic sediments by around 200 km in the last 4 Ma. The piled up sediment is rising into mountains at the rate of 5 mm per year.
The major seismic faults in Taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between the various terranes. As a result, Taiwan has numerous mud volcanoes and hot springs. These faults have produced several major quakes throughout the history of the island, including the 1951 East Rift Valley earthquakes on the East Rift Valley (花東縱谷) and 1964 Baihe earthquake on the Chukou Fault. The 1946 Hsinhua earthquake ruptured the Hsinhua fault (新化斷層). The most lethal was 1935 Hsinchu-Taichung earthquake shifting on a fault at Emei Township, Hsinchu County. The second deadliest was a 7.3 quake that ruptured the Chelongpu Fault (車籠埔斷層) on 21 September 1999, known as the "921 earthquake". On 4 March 2010 at about 01:20 UTC, a magnitude 6.4 earthquake hit southern Taiwan. The seismic hazard map for Taiwan by the USGS shows 9/10 of the island as the highest rating (most hazardous).
Offshore.
The offshore features include the Kaoping Slope extending off the southwest coast of Taiwan into the South China Sea. This is emerging from the sea over time to extend the island.
The Henchung Ridge extends south from the Hengchun Peninsula (恆春半島), and is the submarine part of the Central Range. The Southern Longitudinal Trough is the southern underwater extension of the Longitudinal Valley. The Huatang Ridge extends south off the coast from Taitung City. The Taitung Trough lies to the east behind the Luzon Arc. The Luzon Arc comes to the surface on the islands of Lüdao and Lanyu. A submarine canyon, the Taitung Canyon, cuts through the arc between the two islands linking the Taitung Trough to the Huatung Basin. The canyon cuts across the Huatung Basin bending to the north and reaching the Ryukyu Trench. A 5.5 magnitude earthquake struck at 08:00 GMT on 20 March 2011, near the canyon breaking segments C and D of the East Asia Crossing undersea cable. The Huatung Basin lies east of Taiwan south of the city of Hualien. It extends west till the Gagua Ridge about 110 km offshore.
The Taiwan Banks are a shallow part of the main continental shelf off mainland China lying to the south and south west of Penghu Islands. The Taixinan Basin (台西南盆地) is located between Taiwan Banks and the Central Mountains.
The Okinawa Trough, the back-arc basin behind the Ryukyu Islands, shows up on the coastline as a bay between Dome Point north to Sanshokiaku (easternmost point of Taiwan). (24.6° to 25°N)
Geophysics.
Taiwan has just about the strongest positive Bouguer gravity anomaly in China in the Coastal Range, at over +4x10−4 ms−2. A local low below -2x10−4 ms−2 is on the western side centered near Zhoulan. The gravity low is due to a mass deficit in the Taiwan Strait which is a flexural basin.
Positive magnetic variations are found in narrow strips, west-southwest oriented of the west coast, and east-northeast off the northern coast, and south-north offshore from the Coastal Range heading south. These are of the order of 200 nT.
The Crustal thickness is around 30 km, with over 2 km of thickening under the Central Range, and thinning off the east coast. Taiwan is on the edge of the continental shelf, so the thickness of the crust is constant through the Taiwan Strait to the mainland.
Heat flow is greatest to west of the Longitudinal Valley at rates exceeding 240 mWm−2.
Hydrology.
Many of the rocks in Taiwan have low pore space and have little ground water.
There are several hot springs in Taiwan, with most around the northern volcanic region. The Chingshui geothermal region is named after the Cingshuei River 13 km south west of Yilan.
Rivers in Taiwan transport a large amount of sediment to the sea. The south end of the Longitudonal Valley discharges the Peinan River with 88,000,000 tons of sediment per year. East flowing rivers move 17, 15 31 and 22 megatons per year of sediment. The Cho Shiu shifts 54 MT per year. Rivers running south from the Central Range move over 100 MT of sediment per year.
Study.
Mapping.
The first geological map of Taiwan was made in 1898 by Y. Ishii titled "A Map of Geology and Mineral Resources of the Island of Taiwan". It was at a scale of 1:800,000 and showed six items in its legend. Japan needed oil and coal for the war against Russia in 1904, so study began on the coal fields in the north part of Taiwan, more detailed maps were made, and the next one was published in 1911 by Y. Deguchi and G. Hosoya at a scale of 1:300,000. A third map was produced in 1926 titled: "Geological Map of Taiwan showing Mineral Distribution" by Y. Ichikawa and H. Takahashi. It showed 19 rock units. A 1935 coloured map by Y. Ichikawa had a scale of 1:500,000. In 1953 the Geological Survey of Taiwan (台灣地質調查所) published a map compiled by L.S. Chang at a 1:300,000 scale. A 1974 map had two scales 1:250,000 and 1:500,000. A second edition was printed in 1986 along with notes.

Sheffield Attercliffe by-election, 1909

A by-election was held for the British House of Commons constituency of Sheffield Attercliffe on 4 May 1909.
Background.
The election was caused by the resignation of J. Batty Langley, due to long-term ill health. He had been the Liberal Party Member of Parliament for the seat since an 1894 by-election. He had been re-elected unopposed at the 1895 and 1900 UK general elections. Arnold Muir Wilson, a local Conservative Party councillor and honorary consul for Serbia had contested the seat in 1906, taking 46.8% of the vote.
Attercliffe, a district of north east Sheffield, was a heavy industry, working class area. At the time of the election, there was extremely high unemployment in the area.
Candidates.
The Liberal Party approached Arthur Neal, then a local councillor, but he declined nomination. Only one candidate then put themselves forward for nomination: Richard Cornthwaite Lambert, a London-based barrister who had narrowly failed to win Sheffield Ecclesall at the 1906 election.
As Wilson was out of the country, the Conservatives nominated a new candidate, Sydney Charles King-Farlow. A newcomer to politics, he was a barrister based in the south east of England. Wilson objected to the decision to stand an outsider, and decided to stand as an independent candidate. He was adopted by an unofficial panel of Conservative Party members, and offered to withdraw if the party apologised to him, withdrew King-Farlow and instead adopted a candidate of his choice. This offer was not accepted.
The Labour Party asked President of the Yorkshire Miners' Association Herbert Smith to stand, but he declined. Instead, they stood Joseph Pointer, Chair of Sheffield Trades Council and a local councillor. He was a member of the Independent Labour Party and the United Patternmakers Association, but both organisations initially refused to sponsor his candidacy, the Patternmakers finally agreeing on 20 April to finance him.
Campaign.
The campaign was short, but hard-fought. Lambert campaigned as "the People's Candidate", opposing taxes on food. He described himself as a radical, and announced that he would not say a word of apology or in defence of the government, but that its conduct had been admirable.
Muir Wilson stood on a protectionist platform, under the slogan "Vote for the Tory Chicken!! Kill the London Cuckoo!!". Surprisingly for a Conservative, he called for the redistribution of wealth and the nationalisation of railways and collieries. King-Farlow promised "more work for Englishmen and less work for foreigners". The two engaged in a widely discussed dispute, Muir Wilson writing to King-Farlow "I think you have found out by now how you have been fooled and betrayed, so you have better throw the sponge up and return to London". The two held rival meetings a few feet apart in Heeley, and Muir Wilson attacked local Conservative MP Samuel Roberts for appearing on King-Farlow's platform. Roberts called Muir Wilson a "mountebank", but subsequently suggested that the party should withdraw their candidate and apologies to Muir Wilson. Other Tories advocated both candidates standing down in favour of Fred Kelley, a local brewer, but he stated that he would not stand even if asked.
Ramsay Macdonald, Keir Hardie and Arthur Henderson, among others, came to campaign for Pointer. His campaign was criticised for being poorly organised, and suffered from a lack of resources, being largely based on open air speeches.
At the end of April, Captain Hunnable, an eccentric poet from Ilford, arrived in the constituency, promising to raise wages to £2 a week and form a government within five years. He considered supporting Muir Wilson, but rejected the idea after a meeting, and briefly attempted to stand as a fifth candidate, but gave up after he divined a horoscope stating the Muir Wilson would win.
The Women's Social and Political Union intervened in the election, with Emmeline Pankhurst speaking. The organisation was broadly sympathetic to the Labour Party, but all four candidates endorsed women's suffrage. However, they were pelted with rotten eggs and vegetables during at least one open-air meeting, and appealed for police protection. During the campaign, they collected 5,000 signatures from local voters to a petition to enfranchise women.
The "Manchester Guardian" predicted that Lambert would win easily, taking at least 5,000 votes, with eight or nine thousand shared between the other three candidates.
Result.
The result was announced on a large illuminated screen at Sheffield Town Hall, and a big crowd awaited the result of the contest. With the Conservative vote split, Pointer was able to take enough votes from the Liberals to achieve a narrow victory, with the Liberals dropping from first to third place. With only 27.5% of the vote, this remains the lowest ever winning share in a single-member by-election. At the time, the possibility of winning a seat with such a low share of the vote was described by the "Daily Chronicle" as an "absurdity", making the case for preferential voting. The Labour gain, and the dramatic fall in the Liberal vote, encouraged David Lloyd George to move the party to the left, and the next months saw a series of large Liberal victories in their safe seats. On 22 May, Winston Churchill spoke in favour of the introduction of proportional representation, claiming that "the present system has clearly broken down. The results produced are not fair to any party... all they secure is fluke representation".
Immediately after the announcement, Muir Wilson thanked Pointer and Lambert, but accused King-Farlow of being "warped by the prejudice of others". Later in the evening, King-Farlow confronted him, calling him a "cad and a liar", and the two Conservatives had to be separated. The following week, Muir Wilson called a public meeting, at which he complained that he had spent £1,100 on contesting the 1906 and 1909 elections, and "if that is not enough to buy the seat of Attercliffe, I don't know what is". Later in the month, he sued King-Farlow for assault on the election night, and for damage to his bowler hat. The case was dismissed before Muir Wilson was able to give evidence.
Pointer held the seat until his death in 1914. Lambert finally won a seat at Cricklade in 1910. Wilson died a few months after the by-election, without ever having returned to the UK. King-Farlow contested the seat again in January 1910, then stood in Hackney South in December, but was never elected, and instead became a judge in British East Africa.

William Elliott (lieutenant)

William Elliott (died 1792), was a lieutenant in the royal navy and marine painter.
Elliott gained some repute from his paintings of the naval actions between 1780 and 1790. He first appears as an exhibitor in 1774 at the Free Society of Artists, with 'A Perspective View of the European Factory at Canton in China,' and 'A View of the Green, &c. at Calcutta in Bengal.' At the Royal Academy he first appears as an honorary exhibitor in 1784 with 'A Frigate and Cutter in Chase;' to the same exhibition he subsequently contributed 'The Fleet in Port Royal Harbour, Jamaica, after the Action of 12 June 1781' (1785), 'View of the City of Quebec' (1786), 'Breaking the French Line during Lord Rodney's Action on 12 April 1782' (1787), 'The Fire at Kingston, Jamaica, on 8 Feb. 1782' (1788), 'The Action between H.M.S. Quebec and Le Surveillant' and 'The Action between H.M.S. Serapis and Le Bonhomme' (1789).
Elliott was a fellow of the Incorporated Society of Artists, and contributed seven pictures to their exhibition in 1790, and six to that in 1791, in which year he was president of the society. There are two pictures of the English fleet by him in the royal collection at Hampton Court. Elliott (then captain) died at Leeds on 21 July 1792. Some of his pictures were engraved, including 'The Dreadful Situation of the Halsewell, East Indiaman, 6 Jan. 1786,' which he engraved in aquatint himself.

Casa degli Omenoni

Casa degli Omenoni is a historic palace of Milan, located in the eponymous street of Via degli Omenoni (number 3). It was designed by sculptor Leone Leoni for himself; he both lived and worked there. It owes its name to the eight atlantes decorating its facade, termed "omenoni" ("big men" in Milanese), which were sculpted by Antonio Abondio, most probably on a design by Leoni. Lions (a reference to the "Leoni" family) are a recurring theme of its decorations; in particular, a large relief placed under the cornice depicts two lions tearing a satyr into pieces. The overall style of the palace and the decorations have been noted to include several references to the art of Michelangelo. The internal courtyard, modified in 1929 by Piero Portaluppi, has a colonnade with metopes and triglyphs.
Artist and historian Giorgio Vasari expressed his admiration for the palace, stating that it was "pieno [...] di capricciose invenzioni" ("full of capricious inventions"). At the time, the palace also housed a notable collection of art works and antiquities, which has been dispersed over time. According to an inventory dating back to 1615, it had paintings by Titian, Parmigianino, and Michelangelo; the inventory also mentions a book of drawings by Leonardo da Vinci, which scholars identify with the "Codex Atlanticus" now preserved in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana.
The palace has been largely restored and restructured in the 19th and 20th century; only the facade has remained almost unchanged, except for the addition of iron balconies and of the attic.
After being owned by Leone Leoni and then by his son Pompeo Leoni, the house was sold by Pompeo's son-in-law Polidoro Calchi, and over time was owned by several notable Milanese families, including the Belgioioso, the Pozzi, and the Besana. It was also used as the seat of the music-publishing company Casa Ricordi, as a seat of the Fascist party, and as a theatre.

Captain Slaughterboard Drops Anchor

Captain Slaughterboard Drops Anchor is a darkly humorous children's picture book written and illustrated by the British author Mervyn Peake and published by Country Life in 1939. It was his first published work. The story concerns the nautical exploits of the titular captain and his rambunctious crew aboard their ship "The Black Tiger". After some episodic adventures they capture a small humanoid, referred to only as the Yellow Creature, with whom Slaughterboard develops a strange platonic infatuation. His loyal crew gradually fall prey to misadventure and the book ends with the Captain and the Yellow Creature forsaking piracy for fishing on the creature's pink island. The book is notable for Peake's poetic style and his fine illustrations of the many fantastical beasts on the island.
Captain Slaughterboard makes an appearance in the comic book series "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" where "The Black Tiger" is used as a venue for a pirate conference.

Daryl Bourke

Daryl Bourke (born 7 April 1965) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the 1980s.
A centreman, Bourke played nine games in each of his two seasons at Melbourne. He then joined the Brisbane Bears for their inaugural VFL season in 1987 but couldn't break into the team. Instead he became a leading player in the Queensland Australian Football League, with Morningside. 
He had a knee reconstruction in 1988, his first year as captain, but played some of the best football of his career a year later to win the Grogan Medal. In 1991 he captained Morningside to a premiership and participated in two further premierships in 1993 and 1994. He gave up the captaincy in 1993 to become assistant playing coach and won another Grogan Medal that year, in a three way tie, to become the first Morningside player to win it twice. When he finally retired as a player he had amassed 187 QAFL games, with eight top two finishes in his club's "Best and Fairest", including three wins. He also represented Queensland on ten occasions.

Echinomastus mariposensis

Echinomastus mariposensis (syn. "Neolloydia mariposensis", "Sclerocactus mariposensis") is a rare species of cactus known by the common names Lloyd's fishhook cactus, golfball cactus, silver column cactus, and Mariposa cactus. It is native to a small section of territory straddling the border between Brewster County, Texas, in the United States and the state of Coahuila in Mexico. It has been federally listed as a threatened species in the United States since 1979.
Habitat.
This tiny cactus grows at about 30 sites in Texas and Coahuila, many of which are located within Big Bend National Park and the Black Gap Wildlife Management Area. In Coahuila it has been observed near Cuatro Ciénegas and Monclova. It is named for the Mariposa Mine, a mercury mine in Texas, where it was first discovered. It was described in 1945. The plant grows in Chihuahuan Desert scrub amongst other plants such as beaked yucca ("Yucca rostrata"), creosote ("Larrea tridentata"), and lechuguilla ("Agave lechuguilla"), as well as many other cacti. It grows in barren, exposed, rocky habitat with substrates of limestone; it does not occur in the adjacent parts of the habitat where the rock is gypsum, and the related "Echinomastus warnockii" fills its niche there. This cactus may grow alongside the bunched cory cactus ("Coryphantha ramillosa"), another threatened cactus species.
Characteristics.
This is a petite cactus growing up to 10 centimeters tall by 6 wide. The body is covered with areoles bearing spines. The central spines are up to 2 centimeters long and are white, gray, or yellow in color with brownish or bluish tips. Each areole also has many radial spines which are smaller and white or gray in color, sometimes with brown tips. The flowers are white, or pink fading to white over time, often with dark midstripes, and up to 3 centimeters long. The fruit is about a centimeter in length and yellow-green in color. Blooming occurs in February and March.
Endangered status.
Threats to this rare species have included mercury mining, petroleum exploration activities, off-road vehicles, and grazing. The worst threat has been poaching by cactus collectors. The collectors employed professional diggers to go into the habitat and retrieve this and other species of cacti, which were stockpiled, shipped away for sale, and sometimes discarded or wasted. The type locality of the cactus has been scoured for specimens and few are found there anymore. Plants in Big Bend National Park occur on rugged terrain and have generally been safe from collectors. In 1983 the cactus was placed on Appendix 1 of CITES in an effort to protect it from harvesting.

Testify (M People song)

"Testify" is the eighteenth overall single from British band M People. It is the lead single from their greatest hits albums "The Best of M People" and, in North America, "Testify". It was written by Mike Pickering, Paul Heard and Heather Small, and produced by M People. The single was released on 26 October 1998 and peaked at number twelve on the UK Singles Chart.
Music video.
To support the release of this single, the band filmed their most expensively produced video on 10 September 1998 in London and was created with a budget of £750,000 and directed by New Zealand-born Gregory Rood who, had worked with Heather on the Perfect Day promotional video for the BBC and produced by William Oakely for 'Pop @ Paul Weiland', the Music Video division of the Paul Weiland Film Company.
Heather stands in the middle of a forest with snow on the ground singing all alone and all covered up in a Red Riding Hood-style cape only to then reveal as the wind blows, half way through the song, that she's wearing an eye-catching £250,000 diamond necklace and bodice in the middle of this (computer-generated) arctic wonderland with the snow falling and steam coming out of Heather's mouth as she sings. Meanwhile, in the surrounding blocks of ice, band mates Mike Pickering, Paul Heard and Shovell are all encased and motionless.
Chart performance.
On physical release, the midweek charts indicated that "Testify" would chart at number 10 and give them their eleventh UK Top 10 single, however, with four higher new Top 10 entries that week, the single would be pushed down to number 12 where it finally entered and peaked on the chart. It spent six weeks on the chart descending briskly from 12 to 25 to 37 to 51 to 63 to 67.
Airplay.
A week after filming the single was serviced to radio and entered the Airplay chart that first week at 134 moving to 75 to 32 and to number 24. Radio did not pick up the single as fast as previous lead singles, "Just for You" (No. 1), "Sight for Sore Eyes" (No. 2) and "One Night in Heaven" (No. 1). Despite that fact that Capital Radio had A-listed the single, BBC Radio 2 pledged their typical support and made it their "Single of the week". In the week of release the single climber as high as number 14, being the lowest placed M People single on Airplay for six years since "Excited" in 1992. It remained on the airplay chart for eight weeks in total.
Remixes.
The success of the single on other charts was down to both D'Influence, Ronin (for the "Big String Remix") and in particular Rae and Christian who really exploited the RnB sound to its fullest and used the extra backing vocalist ad-libs to really form the sound and help the single go top 5 and stand up as a genuine record on the RnB Chart. So much so that it was a top 5 hit on the R&B chart, a much bigger success than on other charts.

<doc id="31199724" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31199724" title="The Really Big Chorus">
The Really Big Chorus

The Really Big Chorus (TRBC) is Britain’s largest choral society, made up of singers from hundreds of different choirs all over the UK as well as thousands of individuals. It was founded by Don Monro. 
The Really Big Chorus gathers three times a year at the Royal Albert Hall. The flagship event is "Messiah from Scratch" that attracts over 3,000 singers, and there are also weekends in European cities and leisurely cruises. Any singer can take part and there are no auditions, but singers are expected to learn the music in advance.
The first concert was "Messiah from Scratch", performed at the Royal Albert Hall in 1974. The conductor was Gavin Park. In 1979, the fifth anniversary of "Messiah from Scratch", Park’s research took him on sabbatical to the USA. David Willcocks was approached and agreed to conduct.
Park gracefully deferred and played cello in the orchestra until his early death from cancer. From this point "Messiah from Scratch" became an event organised primarily for the benefit of choral singers, and the roster of works performed at the Royal Albert Hall grew. By the end of the 1990s, Requiems by Brahms, Mozart, Fauré and Verdi were taking their place alongside performances of Orff’s Carmina Burana, Elgar’s Dream of Gerontius and Vivaldi’s Gloria.
In 1993, following David Willcocks’ advice, Don Monro decided to lift the standard of performances even further by employing a professional orchestra. The English Festival Orchestra (founded by Trevor Ford) was already known to Sir David through its work with the Leith Hill Musical Festival of which Sir David was the president.
At a summer event in 1999, The Really Big Chorus gave the first performances of "Sing!", a new composition by Sir David, a choral setting of his own words to Widor’s "Toccata", which was played on the Royal Albert Hall organ by Jane Watts, with additional material for the orchestra. The concert marked Sir David’s 50th performance with TRBC. 
In May 2010, a Scratch Celebration Concert for Sir David Willcocks was held as he conducted his final concert for The Really Big Chorus. Guest speaker was Brian Kay and special guests were the Choir of Kings’ College Cambridge, conducted by Stephen Cleobury.
The Really Big Chorus first worked with Brian Kay in July 2005, in a performance of "Carmina Burana". In November 2010, he conducted his first "Messiah from Scratch". Kay has now been appointed principal conductor.
In July 2010 TRBC singers performed the world premiere of Karl Jenkins’ "Gloria", a work commissioned by The Really Big Chorus. His work "The Armed Man" had been performed at the Royal Albert Hall by TRBC in July 2008. On 11 September 2011, Karl conducted TRBC singers in a memorial concert of "The Armed Man" at the Avery Fisher Hall (part of the Lincoln Center), New York. A second commission from Karl Jenkins, "Gods of Olympus", inspired by the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, had its first performance at the Royal Albert Hall in July 2012.
2014 is the 40th anniversary of The Really Big Chorus, and another choral work as been commissioned, this time from the composer Jonathan Willcocks (son of Sir David, mentioned above). The work, entitled "In Praise of Singing" (for soprano and baritone soloists, chorus and symphony orchestra) was commissioned by Don Monro and will receive its first performance on 13 July 2014. Sadly, Don Monro will not hear it, as he died on 25 May 2014 after a year-long battle with cancer.

2011 Skate America

The 2011 Skate America was an ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating competition in the 2011–2012 season. Organized by the United States Figure Skating Association, it was the first of six events in the 2011–2012 ISU Grand Prix, a series of senior-level international invitational competitions.
The event was held at the Citizens Business Bank Arena in Ontario, California from October 21–23, 2011. Medals were awarded in the disciplines of men's singles, ladies' singles, pair skating, and ice dancing. Skaters also earned points towards qualifying for the 2011–2012 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final.
Eligibility.
Skaters who reached the age of 14 by July 1, 2011 were eligible to compete on the senior Grand Prix circuit.
In July 2011, minimum score requirements were added to the Grand Prix series and were set at two-thirds of the top scores at the 2011 World Championships. Prior to competing in a Grand Prix event, skaters were required to earn the following:
Entries.
The entries were as follows.
Results.
Men.
Michal Březina took an eight-point lead in the short program. He was concerned by the narrowness of the rink: "I was kind of scared if I will fit with the curve because the rink is not so wide. I almost hit the board in practice when I was going for the triple flip." He was third in the free skate but held on to win his first Grand Prix title. Kevin van der Perren placed fourth in the short and won the free skate to take silver medal, his first GP medal since 2007 Skate Canada International. It was the third Grand Prix silver medal of his career. The 2009 Skate America champion, Takahiko Kozuka, took the bronze medal. This was the first time that no US skater stood on the men's podium at Skate America.
Ladies.
Alissa Czisny won the short program, while Carolina Kostner placed first in the free skate. Czisny edged out Kostner by only 0.13 points for the gold medal. Viktoria Helgesson took the bronze and became the first Swedish skater to win a Grand Prix medal.
Pairs.
In the short program, Savchenko and Szolkowy attempted the rare throw triple Axel for the first time in their career but experienced a hard fall. They were given credit for completing the revolutions and finished in 5th place, 3.4 points off the lead. They rebounded to place first in the free skate and won their second consecutive Skate America title and third in their career. They added a reverse lasso lift to their free program but performed only a double twist because they were still working on a new entry to the triple. Dan Zhang and Hao Zhang took silver, their fifth medal at Skate America, after missing the previous season due to hand, shoulder and knee injuries. Kirsten Moore-Towers and Dylan Moscovitch won the bronze, their second medal at the event.
Ice dancing.
Davis and White repeated as Skate America champions, with Pechalat and Bourzat winning the silver medal, and Tobias and Stagniunas pulling up from fifth to take bronze, their first Grand Prix medal. Bourzat was recovering from bronchitis.

Squid Kid

Squid Kid is a platform game on the Apple App store released on March 10, 2011 and is currently compatible with the iPhone and iPod touch running IOS 3.1 and above.
Plot.
For millions of years the world's oceans were always violent place. For fish and crustaceans alike life in the sea was hard, the strong would prey on the weak and for the cephalopods life was especially tough, many joined the criminals rather than be exploited by them. Due to their changeable body size they were ideal for squeezing through small gaps and were used primarily in robberies.
This turbulent undersea underworld eventually gave rise to vicious criminal gangs, the four most prominent of these gangs carve the undersea territories between them.
These four crime lords were known as Mussel Man, Limpet Man, Kung Fu Haddock and Calamity Crab.
After many years of oppression and seemingly no one wishing to get involved one cephalopod did. Not wishing to put his family in danger and wishing to remain anonymous the young squid donned a mask and decided to single handedly take down all four of the main gangs in an attempt to make the sea a safer place. Calling himself Squid Kid he set about saving the sea single handedly.
Gameplay.
In a twist on the traditional platform genre, Squid Kid is controlled by attaching his tentacles to blocks and then dragging him around to begin a pendulous swinging motion. Releasing on the upswing sees Squid Kid release and propel himself to the next closest block. On occasion he can do a swim boost that allows him to fire a jet of ink to propel him away from danger.
Squid Kid must navigate through 20 levels, covering 4 worlds. Each world denoting a lair of a crime boss. After 4 levels Squid Kid faces one of 4 crime bosses who he must defeat buy hitting him with bombs in order to progress to the next crime boss' lair.
Trying to stop Squid Kid is a myriad of henchmen and obstacles. Fire Eels blow up anything that they come into contact with, Ninja Starfish bounce Squid Kid in the other direction, Stone fish turn squid kid to stone and puffa fish bloat Squid Kid to an enormous size making it difficult to navigate the level. 
There are other hazards for Squid kid to negotiate, such as Toxic Waste, deadly spikes, giant axes, stinging Jelly Fish and even fishermen's hooks.
History.
Taking its cue from retro platform games such as "Super Mario Bros" and Megaman popularised in the 1980s, "Squid Kid" is a 3D animated platform game that takes many of the existing elements of the platform genre such as blocks to jump on and obstacles to navigate, giving the twist of swimming through the environment as opposed to running and jumping.

Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission

The Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (), better known as CySEC, is the financial regulatory agency of the Republic of Cyprus.
Since Cyprus became a member of the European Union in 2004, CySEC has become part of European MiFID regulation, giving firms registered in Cyprus access to all European markets. This has led to a number of overseas firms registering in Cyprus to take advantage of this regulatory regime.
Notably is the significant number of overseas retail forex brokers that have obtained registration from CySEC as they generally see this as an easy way to get a license without having to meet stringent requirements that would be imposed by other European financial regulators, yet still qualify under MiFID and so completely free to operate in all European Union member countries.
History.
CySEC was launched in 2001 as part of section 5 of the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (Establishment and Responsibilities) Law of 2001 as a public corporate body.
Cyprus joining the EU in 2004 and adopting the Euro in 2008 significantly changed the financial regulatory framework that CySEC policed for what had been previously been considered a tax haven.
On May 3, 2012, CySEC announced a policy change regarding the classification of binary options as financial instruments. The effect was that binary options platforms operating in Cyprus (where many of the platforms are based) had to be regulated. This made CySEC the first financial regulator globally to recognise and regulate binary options as financial instruments.
Responsibilities.
The Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission has the following responsibilities:
Structure.
CySEC is administrated by a five member Board which is composed of the Chairman, the Vice-Chairman that are employed full-time plus three other members. In addition of the Governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus is represented by a non voting board member.
The members of Board are named by the Council of Ministers following a proposal of the Minister of Finance and their service is a five-year term.

Kathryn Bolkovac

Kathryn Bolkovac is an American former police investigator from Nebraska. She worked as a UN International Police Force monitor. She came to prominence when she sued her employers for unfair dismissal after she lost her job following her attempts to expose sex trafficking in Bosnia. Her story was dramatized in the film "The Whistleblower".
Bosnia.
Originally hired by DynCorp Aerospace, a British subsidiary of US based DynCorp, in the framework of a UN-related contract, she filed a lawsuit in Great Britain against DynCorp for unfair dismissal due to a protected disclosure (whistleblowing), and on 2 August 2002 the tribunal unanimously found in her favor. DynCorp had a $15 million contract to hire and train police officers for duty in Bosnia at the time. She reported such officers were paying for prostitutes and participating in sex trafficking. Many of these officers were forced to resign under suspicion of illegal activity, but none have been prosecuted, as they also enjoy immunity from prosecution in Bosnia. Madeleine Rees testified in her support.
She lives in Lincoln, Nebraska, and Amsterdam.
Media.
Bolkovac's story was made into a film, "The Whistleblower", released in 2010. Following a film screening of "The Whistleblower", UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon opened a panel discussion on sexual exploitation and abuse in conflict and post-conflict situations. The filmmaker and senior UN officials addressed issues raised in the film, including human trafficking and forced prostitution as well as the Organization's effort to combat sexual exploitation of women and children. 
Bolkovac has also co-authored a 2011 book with Cari Lynn "The Whistleblower: Sex Trafficking, Military Contractors and One Woman's Fight for Justice".

Collège philosophique

Collège philosophique was an association founded in 1946 by Jean Wahl, located in the Latin Quarter in Paris.
Wahl created it because he felt the lack of an alternative to the "Sorbonne" (University of Paris), where it would be possible to give voice to non-academic discourses; it became the place where non-conformist intellectuals - and those believing themselves to be so - were tolerated and given consideration.
It 1974, after Wahl's death, it inspired the foundation of the "Collège de philosophie".
Notable conferences.
On March 4, 1963, it hosted the conference from which originated the rift between Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault. Derrida gave the lecture "Cogito and the History of Madness", a critique of Foucault, that possibly also prompted Foucault to write his works "The Order of Things" (1966) and "The Archaeology of Knowledge".

Bordeaux–Irun railway

The railway from Bordeaux to Irun is an important French 235-kilometre long railway line, that connects the southwestern city Bordeaux to northern Spain. The railway was opened in several stages between 1841 and 1864.
Route.
The Bordeaux–Irun railway leaves the Gare de Bordeaux-Saint-Jean in southwestern direction. The first approximately 145 km of its course runs through the Landes forest. At Lamothe the line to Arcachon branches off, and the line turns south. At Dax the line leaves the Landes forest, and the line to Puyoô and Pau branches off. The railway continues downstream along the right bank of the river Adour until Saubusse, where it turns west towards the Atlantic coast, and then south. It crosses the river Adour in Bayonne, and turns southwest. It passes along the ocean resorts Biarritz and Saint-Jean-de-Luz. It crosses the Spanish border between Hendaye and Irun, where the railway ends. France and Spain have different rail gauges (standard gauge and Iberian gauge, resp.), which requires change of trains. The section between Hendaye and Irun has tracks with both gauges.
Main stations.
The main stations on the Bordeaux–Irun railway are:
History.
The railway was built by the Compagnie des Chemins de fer du Midi and its predecessor "Compagnie du chemin de fer de Bordeaux à La Teste". The first section that was opened in 1841 led from Bordeaux to Lamothe, a section that is shared with the railway to Arcachon. The line was extended to Dax in 1854. The section between Dax and Bayonne was opened in 1855. Finally in 1864 the line was extended from Bayonne to the Spanish border town Irun.
Services.
The Bordeaux–Irun railway is used by the following passenger services:

Chloroxine

Chloroxine (trade name Capitrol; "Kloroxin", "Dichlorchinolinol", "chlorquinol", "halquinol(s)"); Latin "cloroxinum, dichlorchinolinolum") is an antibacterial drug. Oral formulations (under trade name such as Endiaron) are used in infectious diarrhea, disorders of the intestinal microflora (e.g. after antibiotic treatment), giardiasis, inflammatory bowel disease. It is also useful for dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis., as used in shampoos (Capitrol) and dermal creams like (Valpeda, Triaderm).
Mechanism of action.
Chloroxine has bacteriostatic, fungistatic and antiprotozoal properties. It is effective against Streptococci, Staphylococci, Candida, Candida albicans, Shigella and Trichomonads.
The pharma reference also says that it does not adversely affects the natural intestinal microflora, however this claim is unsourced.
Adverse effects.
Rarely occurs, but may cause nausea and vomiting associated with oral administration. It may also cause skin irritation.
Pregnancy and lactation.
Taking tablets during pregnancy or when breast-feeding is not recommended. Pasta should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Sheriff Hill Colliery

Sheriff Hill Colliery or Ellison Main Colliery was a coal mine at Gateshead Fell in County Durham, England. The colliery had two shafts and provided employment to the residents of Sheriff Hill, after it opened in 1793. There were many major accidents resulting in the deaths of workers at the colliery. There was a protracted strike at the colliery in 1834. The colliery closed in 1926.
Opening and ownership.
Sheriff Hill Colliery was situated at the summit of Gateshead Fell at the boundary between Sheriff Hill and Low Fell approximately 2 3/4 miles from Newcastle upon Tyne. The exact date of opening is not known, different sources give dates between 1780 and 1800, though one source provides a date of 1750.
Ownership of the colliery changed hands a number of times: in 1840 the lease was granted to Messers Hutchinson and Lamb under Cuthbert Ellison and when it closed it was owned by the Heworth Coal Company Ltd.
Operation.
As a result of the Hartley Colliery Disaster in 1862, legislation was passed requiring collieries have two exits. Sheriff Hill Colliery had two shafts, the Fanny and Isabella Pits.
Fanny Pit was situated off the turnpike road at the crest of Sheriff Hill alongside wooded area, the Fanny Pit Plantation. The shaft was above sea level and in 1894 plumbed a depth of . The Isabella Pit was shallower with a depth of .
Contemporary evidence provides that the operation of the colliery ran thus:
"The coals are drawn at two shafts by an engine of about 30 horses' power, which raises three corves at once. Another engine, of the same power, is employed in pumping the water to a height of 30 fathoms from the bottom, where it is discharged into a drift of about 1¼ mile in length, and is finally drawn out by an engine at the Low Fell. The waggon-way from the Isabella Pit to the Tyne is about 3 miles in length, and the waggons are transmitted along it chiefly by means of inclined planes.">
Major incidents.
A number of incidents at the colliery resulted in fatalities. TheseThere was an explosion on 27 December 1793 resulting in 14 deaths. Another explosion on 27 June 1815 caused 11 fatalities. Less than six months later, on 11 December 1815, a fire claimed five lives.
On 19 July 1819, an explosion tore through the colliery killing 35 men. It was reported that:
"“On Tuesday morning last, owing, it is reported, to some neglect or mismanagement regarding the safety-lamps in the Sheriff-hill pit, at Gateshead, near Newcastle-on-Tyne, a dreadful explosion took place, by which nearly 40 persons have lost their lives. Had the accident happened and hour later, it is said about 100 persons would have perished. Eighteen of the unhappy sufferers have been interred in Gateshead church-yard, and 14 in the chapel-yard ; the remaining bodies have either given to their respective friends, or are not yet taken out of the pit.
Amongst the poor unfortunates, were three boys from Whitehaven, who had been taken there by their mother, and obtained work, but were soon after dismissed ; their parent subsequently appealed to those in management, and again obtained employment for her children, just in time to share the melancholy fate that has befallen their fellow-sufferers. The same pit, we believe, exploded about four years ago, when considerable damage was done”"
In 1821, pitman John Wilson was rather more fortunate:
"“Early on the morning of Tuesday week, some men belonging to Sheriff-hill Colliery, Northumberland, were waiting the arrival of the gin-horse to go down into the pit. Owing to the cleaning of the boiler, the regular engine rope was not in a working state at the moment; but about 20 fathoms of it, with the chain, were hanging into the shaft. One of the men, John Wilson, having, in the dark, gone incautiously too near the bridge, fell in. Repeated cries from within the shaft at last roused the attention of the other men, who, on repairing to the spot with a light, were told by him that he had fallen into the pit, and was then hanging by the rope.
As soon as the alarm would allow them to take measures for his preservation, they proceeded to adjust the gin-rope — a work that occupied not less than 15 minutes, from their having to discharge it on one pulley and place it upon another. After fixing on a corf, one of them wished to descend in it to his assistance, but this Wilson forbade them to do so. The corf was now let down gently till it came under his feet ; he then freed himself from the engine rope, and being seated in the corf, was drawn slowly to bank, in a state of indescribable trepidation. He was, however, able, with the assistance of another man, to walk upwards of a mile to his own house, which on entering, he threw himself upon his knees, and poured out his fervent thanks to God for his deliverance. No sooner was this done than, overpowered by the dreadful conflict of his feelings, he fainted.
Some time elapsed before he recovered tolerable composure, and even still when the subject is recurred to, his agitation is extreme. Being questioned minutely, he said he had gone to the brink of the shaft to ascertain whether his comrade was calling upon him from below, and being deceived by a glimmering of light through a crevice in the brattice partition, his feet slipped. He was conscious at the moment he dropt in, but has no recollection whatever of how or when he caught hold of the engine rope. The first thing he was sensible of was the rope sliding in his breast, and next its stripping his left hand, which he held mainly on, and also with the legs and feet. He had in his right hand a small stick, of which he kept firm possession all the time, and brought it up with him. There was a chasm of 450 feet perpendicular depth yawning beneath”".
With safety such as issue, failure to adhere to safety standards saw workers given severe punishments. In June 1824, pitmen Timothy Forster and John Miller were ‘committed to hard labour in the House of Correction in Durham’ after removing the top of their Davy safety lamps whilst working in the pit. It was reported that ""similar acts of carelessness are so frequently committed, to the imminent risk of the lives of the colliers, that we understand the coal-owners are determined to punish every such act in future with the utmost rigour.”"
Strikes of 1832 and 1833.
In light of the recurring fatalities, poor working conditions and low pay, miners at Sheriff Hill Colliery undertook one of the earliest large-scale industrial actions in England Such was the scale of the disorder that the traditional Sheriff's March on Gateshead Fell had to be re-routed to avoid it. Pitmen marched through Sheriff Hill and Low Fell carrying a banner depicting the colliery owners as rats, taking the bread from the mouths of the workers.
A year later, the miners were "forcibly ejected from the colliery". The response of the pitmen was sufficiently violent for soldiers from the Newcastle barracks to be called to deal with the dispute. The colliery owners brought in replacement workers from Wales, but when they were met on friendly terms by the ejected miners and their families (camped on Church Road, Sheriff Hill) before arriving at the colliery, many chose to join the camp rather than replace local pitmen. The dispute ended when the colliery owners made concessions and most of the pitmen returned to work, although the strike organisers were deemed 'no longer employable'.
Closure.
The date of closure is unknown, one source suggests it closed before 1895 although a Gateshead Council photograph claims to show pitmen from the colliery in 1924.

<doc id="31200036" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31200036" title="(+)-Naloxone">
(+)-Naloxone

(+)-Naloxone (dextro-naloxone) is a drug which is the "unnatural" enantiomer of the opioid antagonist drug (-)-naloxone. Unlike "normal" naloxone, (+)-naloxone has no significant affinity for opioid receptors, but instead has been discovered to act as a selective antagonist of Toll-like receptor 4. This receptor is involved in immune system responses, and activation of TLR4 induces glial activation and release of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and Interleukin-1.
Relation of TLR4 to opioid drugs.
Both "normal" and "unnatural" enantiomers of various opioid analgesic drugs including morphine, meperidine, fentanyl, methadone and buprenorphine, as well as some otherwise inactive metabolites like morphine-3-glucuronide, have been found to act as agonists of TLR4, and chronic use of these drugs consequently causes constant low-level release of TNF-α and IL-1β as well as other downstream effects. This is thought to be involved in various adverse properties of opioid analgesic drugs, such as loss of efficacy with extended use and the associated development of tolerance and dependence, as well as the development of side effects such as hyperalgesia and allodynia, which can cause long-term use of opioid analgesics to not only fail to treat neuropathic pain, but ultimately exacerbate it.
Applications of (+)-naloxone and related drugs.
Several opioid antagonist drugs were found to act as antagonists for TLR4, including naloxone and naltrexone. However it was found that not only the "normal" (-) enantiomers, but also the "unnatural" (+) enantiomers of these drugs acted as TLR4 antagonists (though (+)-nalmefene was inactive). Since (+)-naloxone and (+)-naltrexone lack affinity for opioid receptors, they do not block the effects of opioid analgesic drugs, and so can be used to counteract the TLR4-mediated side effects of opioid agonists without affecting analgesia, though (+)-naloxone does reduce the reinforcing effects of opioid drugs. (+)-Naloxone was also found to be neuroprotective, and both (+)-naloxone and (+)-naltrexone are effective in their own right at treating symptoms of neuropathic pain in animal models. However (+)-naloxone was also found to reduce the effects of stimulant drugs, suggesting additional actions beyond TLR4 antagonism (possibly as a sigma receptor antagonist), that might potentially result in unwanted side effects or drug interactions.

Elaphoglossum serpens

Elaphoglossum serpens is a rare species of fern that grows only on Cerro de Punta, the highest mountain in Puerto Rico. The fern grows at one location, where there are 22 known specimens. It was federally listed as an endangered species of the United States in 1993.
The fern was described in 1947 from specimens found at Monte Jayuya. This habitat was cleared for construction and the plant was extirpated. It was later located on Cerro de Punta. This fern is an epiphyte which grows on the trunks of the tree species "Lyonia rubiginosa" var. "stahlii". There are only six trees that together host the 22 ferns. This mountain summit is coveted for its ideal location for communications facilities and construction of these facilities has led to destruction of part of the forest there.
This fern produces a few fronds of two different types. The sterile frond is up to 19 centimeters long with a blade at the end measuring up to 8 centimeters long by 3.5 wide. The fertile frond is up to 18 centimeters long and has a smaller blade, up to 4 centimeters long and only about a centimeter wide.
The fern grows on mossy tree trunks in the elfin forest on the highest peak on the island of Puerto Rico. This cloud forest has a short, dense canopy no more than about 7 meters tall. It is very wet, windy, and has saturated soils poor in nutrients.
Because this plant is known from only one location, habitat destruction or disturbance in that area could result in the extinction of the species. The mountain peak was strongly impacted by Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Many permits have been requested by entities interested in building structures in the area, an activity that has caused plant destruction in the past.

Abu Madi

Abu Madi is a cluster of prehistoric, Neolithic tell mounds in Southern Sinai, Egypt. It is located east of the Saint Catherine's Monastery at the bottom of a granite ridge. It was suggested to have been a seasonal encampment for groups of hunter gatherers and contained the remains of two major settlements; Abu Madi I and Abu Madi III. Abi Madi I is a small site with the remains of a partially buried building containing deposits up to a depth of . Abu Madi III was an area of roughly that was excavated close to a large nearby boulder. Dwellings were found to have stone built silos next to them. It was first excavated in the early 1980s by Ofer Bar-Yosef.
Culture.
The culture has been referred to as the Abu Madi Entity as it shows evidence of having retained Natufian characteristics of a temporary settlement, while being at least partly contemporary with the PPNA cultures of the Levant further to the North. It has been dated approximately 10100 to 9700 BP or from between 9660 to 9180 BC with calibrated datings ranging between c. 9750 and 7760 BC. Judging by these radiocarbon dates, Abu Madi has been suggested to be a form of late Khiamian culture. It has been suggested that the dwellings found housed small groups of nuclear families continuing in the Natufian style. A large number of chipped flints were recovered including a new type of aerodynamic arrowhead known as the Abu Madi Point characterised by elongated ovals or rhomboid shapes, occasionally with a small tang. El Khiam points were also found with deep concave bases and it has been suggested these arrowheads were used to hunt such animals as gazelles and wild ibexes. Abu Madi has been suggested to be amongst the ten probable centers for the origin of agriculture and used in statistical analysis to determine the rate of spread into Europe.

Galtee Castle

Galtee Castle was a mansion that was situated on the foothills of the Galtee Mountains at Skeheenarinky in County Tipperary, Ireland approximately 10 km. from Mitchelstown.
Origins.
The original structure was built as a hunting lodge for the 2nd Earl of Kingston around 1780. The 3rd Earl further remodeled it (c.1825).
In the 1850s, the Kingstons were forced to sell off vast amounts of their landed estate due to debts, including the lodge and approximately surrounding it. This became a new estate, the majority of which remained leased to tenant farmers.
The building was remodeled and expanded c.1892 when its new owner Abel Buckley inherited the estate from his brother Nathaniel, he had previously purchased sole ownership in 1873.
Destruction.
The Land Commission; a government agency, acquired the demesne and house in the late 1930s, after allocating the land between afforestation and farmers, the house was offered for sale. The commission accepted an offer from Fr. Tobin of Glanworth Co. Cork. He wished to use the stone and the slates to build a new church in his parish. The building was thus torn down and dismantled c.1941.
Today very little is left on the site of the former house; some of the lower base foundations are all that remain. Nearby are some estate cottages and two gate houses.
The woods and trails around the site have been developed as a public amenity area known as Galtee Castle Woods.

Writing and Difference

Writing and Difference () is a book by French philosopher Jacques Derrida, collecting some of the early lectures and essays that established his international fame. It was published in 1967 alongside "Of Grammatology" and "Speech and Phenomena".
Contents.
Structuralist Controversy.
Included in the collection is his 1966 lecture at Johns Hopkins University, which changed the course of the conference leading it to be renamed "The Structuralist Controversy", and caused Derrida to receive his first major attention outside of France. The lecture is titled "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences".
Cogito and the History of Madness.
The collection contains the essay "Cogito and the History of Madness", a critique of Michel Foucault. It was first given as a lecture on March 4, 1963, at a conference at the "Collège philosophique", which Foucault attended, and caused a rift between the two, possibly prompting Foucault to write "The Order of Things" (1966) and "The Archaeology of Knowledge".
Violence and Metaphysics.
In "Violence and Metaphysics," Derrida comments on the writings of Emmanuel Levinas. He honors Levinas for his ethical philosophy of openness to the Other. Indeed, he goes along with the idea that to live for the Other is the highest good. But he challenges the idea that only face-to-face interaction can be ethical. Whereas Levinas sees written communication as dead and unresponsive, Derrida argues that writing can be just as valuable a space for ethical encounter. He writes, in characteristic support for writing: "Is it not possible to invert all of Levinas’s statements on this point? By showing, for example, that writing can assist itself, for it has time and freedom, escaping better than speech from empirical urgencies."

Yuri Kara

Yuri Viktorovich Kara (Russian: Юрий Викторович Кара), born on 12 November 1954 in Stalino, is a Russian film director, screenwriter and producer.
Biography.
Yuri Kara was born on 12 November 1954 in the Ukrainian city of Stalino, which is now called Donetsk. 
After graduating from high school No.17 in Donetsk in 1972, Yuri Kara entered the Physics and Chemistry department of the Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys (MISA). During his studies, he was the head of the institute's vocal and instrumental ensemble. In 1978, he graduated from the MISA with a degree in physics of metals. He then worked as a radio physics engineer in Donetsk. 
In 1982, he entered the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography, where he worked with film director Sergei Gerasimov and actress Tamara Makarova. He graduated in 1987 with a thesis film "Tomorrow was the War" based on the story written by the Russian author Boris Vasilyev. The picture was sold in 48 countries.
Yuri Kara became known in Russia with his movies "Thieves within the Law" (1988) and "The Feasts of Belshazzar, or a Night with Stalin" (1990), and with his conflict with the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roskosmos) which was caused by his film "The Prize is a Trip into Space", based on the novel "Cassandra's Brand" written by the Russian author Chinghiz Aitmatov. Roskosmos did not allow that actor Vladimir Steklov would really go into space for the film.
In 1994, Yuri Kara became internationally know with the controversies around his film The Master and Margarita. Although the film was made in 1994, it was only premiered in the Russian cinemas on 7 April 2011. Despite the highest budget ever spent on a Russian film and the impressive cast with the most famous Russian actors, the producers decided not to release it. According to them, Yuri Kara's director's cut was unacceptable. The soundtrack recorded by Alfred Schnittke was released on CD though. On 15 November 2010, the Russian film distributor Luxor announced out of the blue that they had bought the rights on Kara's film, and that it would be released in March 2011. Eventually, it would be 7 April 2011.
Kara continued making big budget films like "Queens" (2007), "Reporters" (2008 - video) and "Hamlet 21st Century" (2011)

Zane Taylor (footballer)

Zane Taylor (born 28 February 1957) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Geelong in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the early 1980s. He spent time as a forward and midfielder during his career but it was as a half back flanker that he made the official "Queensland Team of the Century" in 2003.
Although he had only just turned 23 when he started out at Geelong during the 1980 VFL season, Taylor was already a multiple "Best and Fairest" winner for Southport. He was suspended after his debut, for two games, having been found guilty of striking South Melbourne's Michael Wright with a clenched first. The suspension was costly as he was out of the seniors for seven weeks but when he returned he became a regular member of the team for the rest of the season. He played just six games in 1981 but appeared in a preliminary final, his second in two years. 
Taylor returned to Southport during the 1983 VFL season and finished equal first in voting for the Grogan Medal, but was ineligible due to suspension. He however won the award in 1985 and would go on to captain Southport to three premierships. His 26 interstate appearance for Queensland is a record and the medal given to the best player for the state in interstate matches is now named after him. 
He enjoyed considerable team success over the course of his career, playing in 16 grand finals in a 16 year period from 1975 to 1990. The sequence started with four premierships at Southport, while they were in the Gold Coast league. He then played in three successive premierships with the Geelong reserves team from 1980 to 1982, contributing six goals to their 1981 grand final win. In the 1984 season, Southport didn't make the grand final, but Taylor had played in two grand finals in 1978, after getting a permit to appear for Windsor-Zillmere in the QAFL premiership decider. A grand final every year from 1985 to 1990, of which Southport lost only once, meant that he averaged a grand final a year during that period.

European Wound Management Association

The European Wound Management Association (EWMA) was founded in 1991. 
The association works to promote the advancement of education and research into native epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis, prevention and management of wounds of all aetiologies.
EWMA is an umbrella organisation linking wound management associations across Europe and a multidisciplinary group bringing together individuals and organisations interested in wound management. Currently, the association bridges 46 Cooperating Organisations (national wound care associations in Europe) and, in addition, partners with a considerable number of wound and wound related associations in and outside of Europe. Furthermore, EWMA has a large number of individual members from all over Europe. 
EWMA works to reach its objectives by being an educational resource, organising conferences, contributing to international projects related to wound management, actively supporting the implementation of existing knowledge within wound management and providing information on all aspects of wound management.
EWMA Journal.
The EWMA Journal is the official journal of the European Wound Management Association (EWMA). Issues are published in January, May and October.
EWMA Journal is CINAHL indexed and provides peer-reviewed original scientific articles, reviews, clinical information, and information about development in wound healing and management across Europe. The Journal also functions as a communication tool between EWMA, its members and the EWMA Cooperating Organisations. It serves as a means of distributing information and details of initiatives across national borders, thus supporting EWMA’s aim of advancing wound healing within Europe. As EWMA shares the vision of an ‘open access’ philosophy, the Journal is freely available online. 
It is distributed to EWMA members and to members of national wound healing organisations in Europe, as well as to a wider audience via the internet. As a result, each issue of the EWMA Journal is distributed to 12-13,000 nurses, doctors and other health care professionals who have a special interest in wound care.
EWMA Patient Outcome Group.
The EWMA Patient Outcome Group has a clinical scientific platform, including both clinicians and representatives from companies working within wound healing. 
Discussions and objectives of the group touch upon topics such as structure of treatment as well as more traditional clinical trials and approval and reimbursement of wound care products.
Primary objectives of the group are to:
1. Identify barriers: 
2. Propose guidelines for clinical data collection: 
3. Participate in the public debate / policy making: 
4. Create and implement consensus:

NPR controversies

NPR, formerly National Public Radio, is a privately and publicly funded non-profit membership media organization that serves as a national syndicator to 797 public radio stations in the United States of America. Various allegations of bias, both from conservative and liberal sources, and controversies have arisen throughout NPR's history.
Allegations of ideological bias.
Allegations of bias against Israel.
NPR has been criticised for perceived bias in its coverage of Israel. The Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA), a pro-Israel American media monitoring organization based in Boston, has been particularly critical of NPR. CAMERA director Andrea Levin has stated, "We consider NPR to be the most seriously biased mainstream media outlet," a statement that "The Boston Globe" describes as having "clearly gotten under her target's skin." NPR's then-Ombudsman, Jeffrey Dvorkin, said in a 2002 interview that CAMERA used selective citations and subjective definitions of what it considers pro-Palestinian bias in formulating its findings, and that he felt CAMERA's campaign was "a kind of McCarthyism, frankly, that bashes us and causes people to question our commitment to doing this story fairly. And it exacerbates the legitimate anxieties of many in the Jewish community about the survival of Israel."
Allegations of elitism and the status quo.
A 2004 FAIR study concluded that "NPR’s guestlist shows the radio service relies on the same elite and influential sources that dominate mainstream commercial news, and falls short of reflecting the diversity of the American public."
Noam Chomsky has criticized NPR as being biased toward ideological power and the status quo. He alleges that the parameters of debate on a given topic are very consciously curtailed. He says that since the network maintains studios in ideological centers of opinion such as Washington, the network feels the necessity to carefully consider what kinds of dissenting opinion are acceptable. Thus, political pragmatism, perhaps induced by fear of offending public officials who control some of the NPR's funding (via CPB), often determines what views are suitable for broadcast, meaning that opinions critical of the structures of national-interest-based foreign policy, capitalism, and government bureaucracies (entailed by so-called "radical" or "activist" politics) usually do not make it to air.
Study results.
Consumers of information from NPR contend that NPR does its job well. A study conducted in 2003 by the polling firm Knowledge Networks and the University of Maryland's Program on International Policy Attitudes showed that those who get their news and information from public broadcasting (NPR and PBS) are better informed than those whose information comes from other media outlets. In one study, NPR and PBS audiences had a more accurate understanding of the events in Iraq versus all audiences for cable and broadcast TV networks and the print media.
Controversies.
Mumia Abu-Jamal commentaries.
In 1994, NPR arranged to air commentaries by convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal on "All Things Considered", but cancelled them after the Fraternal Order of Police and members of the U. S. Congress objected to the airing. 
Andrei Codrescu comment.
On the December 19, 1995, broadcast of "All Things Considered", NPR commentator Andrei Codrescu reported that some Christians believe in a "rapture" and 4 million believers will ascend to Heaven immediately. He continued, "The evaporation of 4 million who believe this crap would leave the world an instantly better place."
NPR subsequently apologized for Codrescu's comment, saying, "Those remarks offended listeners and crossed a line of taste and tolerance that we should have defended with greater vigilance." Executive Producer Ellen Weiss said the incident would not sever NPR's relationship with Codrescu.
Juan Williams termination.
On October 20, 2010, NPR terminated Senior News Analyst Juan Williams's independent contract after comments about Muslims which were referred to as "inconsistent with our editorial standards and practices, and undermined his credibility as a news analyst with NPR". Williams' remarks were made on the Fox News Channel's "The O'Reilly Factor" where he concurred with statements suggesting that the United States was facing a "Muslim dilemma". He also said, "I mean, look, Bill, I'm not a bigot. You know the kind of books I've written about the civil rights movement in this country. But when I get on the plane, I got to tell you, if I see people who are in Muslim garb and I think, you know, they are identifying themselves first and foremost as Muslims, I get worried. I get nervous." Furthermore, referring to comments made by a Pakistani immigrant who pleaded guilty to trying to plant a car bomb in Times Square, Williams said "He said the war with Muslims, America's war is just beginning, first drop of blood. I don't think there's any way to get away from these facts."
NPR CEO Vivian Schiller defended NPR's decision by asserting that Williams has a history of making controversial comments in violation of NPR's ethics policy, with commentary expressed on Fox News and in newspaper opinion pieces. He was previously admonished for comments he made about US First-Lady Michelle Obama, "she's got this Stokely Carmichael in a designer dress thing going. If she starts talking ... her instinct is to start with this blame America, you know, I'm the victim. If that stuff starts to coming out, people will go bananas and she'll go from being the new Jackie O. to being something of an albatross." This was far from an isolated incident, and Williams’ appearances on Fox News had caused repeated problems for NPR over the last few years. Williams had also "been warned several times that O’Reilly is a professional provocateur and to be careful." Williams and others have said that in firing him, NPR exhibited a double standard by not firing other NPR people like Andrei Codrescu for his comment about Christians who believe in a rapture and Nina Totenberg for her 1995 comments about Senator Jesse Helms and AIDS.
After NPR announced his ouster, Alicia Shepard, NPR's ombudsman, said that the firing could have been handled better. She opined that Williams could have been given a chance to explain himself to NPR's management or been suspended pending review of his case. However, she agreed with NPR's decision, saying "the fact remains that NPR must uphold its journalistic standards, which, after all, provide the basis that earned public radio's reputation for quality." "Probably the better thing for NPR to have done is to have said 'Juan the situation is not working,'" Shepard said, noting that Williams could have been given a choice: "If he wanted to stay at NPR, he would have to stop doing commentary on Fox News Channel. Or, if he preferred to continue with Fox, he and NPR could part ways." Schiller told an audience at the Atlanta Press Club that Williams should have kept his feelings about Muslims between himself and "his psychiatrist or his publicist". Later, Schiller placed a post on the NPR website "I spoke hastily and I apologize to Juan and others for my thoughtless remark”. Although a number of prominent conservatives, including Jim DeMint, Sarah Palin, and Newt Gingrich have renewed long-standing calls that NPR lose Federal funding that it currently receives, donations from NPR listener-members during NPR's October fundraising drive remained unaffected in the first 3 days. FOX News granted Williams a new $2 million, three-year contract with an expanded role at their network. FOX has been heavily promoting the incident "with hourly reports about the controversy on both its news and opinion programs." Bill O'Reilly has accused NPR of bias in firing Williams.
It was determined after an external review by legal counsel that Williams was properly terminated according to the terms of his contract, which gave both parties the right to terminate on 30 days notice for any reason, and the termination was not the result of special interest group or donor pressure. The board of directors also adopted recommendations and remedial measures designed to address issues that surfaced with the review, including new internal procedures concerning personnel and on air-talent decisions, and disciplinary action with respect to certain management employees involved in the termination. These measures included Ellen Weiss, the Senior Vice President who fired Juan Williams, stepping down on January 6, 2011 under what is believed to be substantial pressure from more senior management, and CEO Vivian Schiller not being awarded her 2010 bonus.
Ronald Schiller.
In March, 2011 conservative political provocateur James O'Keefe sent partners Simon Templar (a nom de plume not to be confused with the fictional character) and Shaughn Adeleye to secretly record their discussion with Ronald Schiller, NPR's then-senior vice president for fundraising, and his associate, the senior director of institutional giving at NPR, Betsy Liley. The NPR executives were misled that they would be meeting with representatives of a self-described Muslim group, Muslim Education Action Center (MEAC), that wished to donate money to NPR, "partly out of concern for the defunding process the Republicans are trying to engage in." On the recording, Schiller indicates that he is sharing his personal point of view, not NPR’s, saying he'll "talk personally, as opposed to wearing my NPR hat"; then he contrasted the fiscally conservative Republican party of old that didn't get involved in people's personal and family lives with "the current Republican Party, particularly the Tea Party, that is fanatically involved in people's personal lives and very fundamental Christian—I wouldn't even call it Christian. It's this weird evangelical kind of move." Schiller said some highly placed Republicans believed the Republican Party had been hijacked by this radical group, and characterized them as "Islamophobic" and "seriously racist, racist people". Later in the recording, Schiller said he believes NPR "would be better off in the long run without federal funding, and the challenge right now is that we'd have a lot of stations go dark", explaining that removal of federal funding would allow NPR more independence, and remove the widely held misconception that NPR is significantly funded by the public. Subsequent analysis of the raw videos showed that the clips were heavily edited to present only one point of view, and that much of the context of the conversation was changed.
According to NPR, Schiller's comments are in direct conflict with NPR's official position and they called his comments appalling. They also stated that, "The fraudulent organization represented in this video repeatedly pressed us to accept a $5 million check with no strings attached, which we repeatedly refused to accept." A second recording released a couple days later by O'Keefe showed that after phone and e-mail communications, Betsy Liley checked with senior manangement and said that although MEAC had been cleared to legally make donations anonymously, additional background information was required before a donation could be accepted, including an IRS Form 990. Schiller had submitted his resignation on January 24, before the recorded meeting, and announced a week before the video was released that he was leaving NPR for a position at the Aspen Institute, but he was immediately put on "administrative leave" by NPR. The next day NPR's CEO Vivian Schiller (who is not related) announced she was resigning her position, effective immediately. Ronald Schiller made his resignation from NPR effective immediately on the evening of the video's release and the next day decided also to cede his new position at the Aspen Institute.
Vivian Schiller.
NPR announced that CEO Vivian Schiller has resigned after controversial comments made by NPR's former top fundraising executive, Ron Schiller (no relation to Vivian) came to light in a secret video. A statement released Wednesday by NPR's board of directors said the resignation by Vivian Schiller, who also faced criticism last fall for the dismissal of commentator Juan Williams, was accepted. But, NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik tells Morning Edition host Renee Montagne that his sources were telling him that the CEO was forced out.
Dave Edwards, chairman of NPR's board, said directors came to the conclusion that the controversies under Schiller's watch had become such a distraction that she could no longer effectively lead the organization. She had told the directors that they should take the action they felt was appropriate, and Edwards said the board decided it would be best for her to depart.
According to a CEO succession plan adopted by the Board in 2009, Joyce Slocum, SVP of Legal Affairs and General Counsel, has been appointed to the position of Interim CEO. The Board will immediately establish an Executive Transition Committee that will develop a timeframe and process for the recruitment and selection of new leadership.
Tax money used for subsidy and lobbying.
NPR's listeners are, according to NPR itself and emphasized by NPR in talks with potential NPR sponsors, substantially wealthier than the average American. David Boaz criticizes what he sees as NPR's transfer of income from the middle class to the upper middle class. Boaz also criticizes NPR's use of tax-subsidized programs in order to lobby for additional tax funds by airing numerous advertisements urging its listeners to call Congress regarding NPR.

Schlachtgeschwader 77

'"Schlachtgeschwader 77 (SG 77) was a Luftwaffe close air support-wing of World War II. 
History.
Schlachtgeschwader 77 was formed on 18 October 1943 in Wassilkow from Stab/Sturzkampfgeschwader 77. With the exception of II. Group which was redesignated as III. Group, Schlachtgeschwader 10, the remaining groups were renamed to Schlachtgeschwader 77.
On 3 March 1945, "9. Staffel" equipped its FW 190F-8s with Panzerblitz 80 mm anti-tank rockets. Adapted from the R4M rocket, these were carried under the outboard wings. 
On 17 April 1945 Stab and III./SG 77 were based at Kamenz, north-east of Dresden. A formation of P-51s of the 55th Fighter Group spotted SG 77's aircraft preparing to take-off. 116-kill 'ace' Oberleutnant August Lambert and two other pilots were taking off when the American fighters appeared. The FW 190s jettisoned their bombs and tried to escape but all three were shot down, Lambert being killed in his FW 190 F-8 'Black 9 + ' north of Hoyerswerda. Seven other FW 190s were destroyed or badly damaged on the ground at Kamenz by the P-51s.

United Nations Security Council Resolution 1626

United Nations Security Council resolution1626, adopted unanimously on 19 September 2005, after recalling all previous resolutions on the situations in Liberia and Sierra Leone, particularly resolutions 1509 (2003), 1610 (2005) and 1620 (2005), the Council extended the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) until 31 March 2006 and authorised the deployment of 250 troops to Sierra Leone to protect the Special Court. 
Resolution.
Observations.
The Security Council recognised the important role that the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and African Union (AU) were playing in the Liberian process in addition to that of the United Nations. It welcomed progress made in preparations towards the general elections in October 2005 and efforts made by the transitional government towards the lifting of sanctions imposed by Resolution 1521 (2003). 
The preamble of the resolution also welcomed the work of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, noting that the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) was ending its mission on 31 December 2005 and the need for continued protection of the court.
Acts.
Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council extended the mandate of UNMIL and called upon the Liberian authorities to ensure free, fair and transparent elections. The international community was urged to provide resources to meet needs relating to ex-combatants and reform of the security sector. 
UNMIL was authorised to deploy 250 personnel to Sierra Leone to protect the Special Court, and at the same time, a temporary increase of UNMIL personnel was ordered until 31 March 2006. Furthermore, UNMIL was also authorised to deploy military personnel to Sierra Leone if needed to evacuate personnel there in the event of an emergency. The United Nations Integrated Office in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL) was instructed to provide support for UNMIL personnel deployed in Sierra Leone. 
The resolution asked the Secretary-General Kofi Annan and government of Sierra Leone to conclude an agreement regarding the status of UNMIL military personnel in the country. United Nations missions in the region were encouraged to pursue intermission co-operation in order to prevent arms trafficking, movement of combatants, the illegal exploitation of natural resources and the implementation of disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programmes.
Finally, the Secretary-General was required to provide a drawdown assessment for UNMIL in his March 2006 report.

Kirk J. Schneider

Kirk J. Schneider, PhD is a psychologist and psychotherapist who has taken a leading role in the advancement of existential-humanistic therapy, and existential-integrative therapy. Schneider is also the current editor of the "Journal of Humanistic Psychology". His major books are "Existential-Humanistic Therapy" (2010), "Existential-Integrative Therapy" (2008), "The Handbook of Humanistic Psychology" (with James Bugental and Fraser Pierson) (2001), "The Psychology of Existence" (with Rollo May)(1995), "Rediscovery of Awe" (2004), and "Awakening to Awe" (2009).
He worked closely with existential and humanistic psychology pioneer Rollo May, and in 2004, was himself the recipient of the Rollo May Award from Division 32 of the American Psychological Association for “outstanding and independent pursuit of new frontiers in humanistic psychology.” He has been integral in fostering global dialogs surrounding existential themes in psychology, and in April 2010, he delivered the opening keynote address at the First (East-West) International Existential Psychology Conference in Nanjing, China. He is also a Fellow of three Divisions of the American Psychological Association (Humanistic, Clinical, and Independent Practice) and has published over 100 articles and chapters and has authored or edited eight books. He is currently vice-president of the Existential-Humanistic Institute (EHI), adjunct faculty at Saybrook Graduate School and Research Center, the California Institute of Integral Studies, and the Institute for Transpersonal Psychology, and contributor to Psychology Today.
Summary of main works.
With the advent of Existential-Integrative Psychotherapy, Schneider expanded the traditional focus of existential therapy on depth exploration to include other, more mainstream treatment modalities. By the same token, he broadened mainstream treatment modalities with the ever-present availability of depth exploration. Existential-Integrative therapy is a "deeply relational approach which uses a range of therapeutic concepts and strategies to help clients engage more fully with their experiencing". Schneider discussed freedom at the level of psychosexuality and how it entails the integration of one's sexual-aggressive past. According to Schneider, liberation at this level strengthens one's ego. Another form of freedom he discussed is that at the level of interpersonal relations and how it acknowledges and transcends freedom at the level of psychosexual relations. He says that at the interpersonal level, freedom balances individual striving and uniqueness with interpersonal dependence and connectedness. He coined the term 'experiential freedom' saying that it "embraces not only physiology, environmental conditioning, cognition, psychosexuality, and interpersonal relations, but also cosmic or intersituational relations". Schneider begins by defining and describing “awe,” a most important attitude and state of being, which has become much less central to our lives in these times.Awe is a fluid attitude,which incorporates wonder, dread,mystery, veneration, and the embracing of paradox.Cultivating awe as central in our consciousness requires that we move away from many of the values with which we are continually confronted: consumerism, conventionality, competitiveness, and mindless entertainment. An awe inspired life also counters all sorts of dogmatic beliefs and convictions, be they fundamentally religious or rigidly atheistic.
With Rediscovery of Awe and Awakening to Awe, Schneider drew upon the rich heritage of existential-spiritual philosophy as elaborated by such thinkers as Paul Tillich, Martin Buber, Abraham Heschel, Søren Kierkegaard, and William James as well as his own clinical and personal observations to cultivate an "awe-based" approach to psychology and life. By "awe-based," Schneider means the sense of humility and wonder or adventure one experiences simply by living. While the sense of awe may be inherent to living it also must be cultivated periodically, lest it be crushed by our "quick fix," efficiency oriented culture; or by political or religious dogma. In Rediscovery of Awe, Schneider set forth the principles of an awe-based psychology as well as applications of those principles to concrete spheres of life, such as the educational setting, the work setting, and the ethical-spiritual setting. In "Awakening to Awe," Schneider focused specifically on how the sense of awe radically transformed seven lives. Among the people he investigated were a former gang member who became a gang mediator, an ex drug addict who became a case worker and Yoga instructor, and a survivor of stage-three cancer. Finally, in Existential-Integrative Psychotherapy, Schneider showed how the humility and wonder cultivated in good therapy can inspire the humility and wonder, or, in short awe, that can be nurtured outside of good therapy.
In his works he took the approach of humanistic psychologists. In this field of psychology, Schneider credits Abe Maslow for being an influential figure in his early years in the field of psychology. He acknowledge that his humanistic perceptions were awakened by Maslow's works. He believed that Maslow implied that our healing comes from our "restoration of awe, the attunement to a larger picture of life". He was a proponent for spiritual healing and trying to attain fulfillment. He uses the theory of awe as a therapeutic method in enlivening lives.

Nuclear energy in Libya

Libya became a member of the IAEA in 1963.
Libya has a Soviet-designed 10 MWt research reactor in Tajura that was built 1981.
In the late 1970s Libya signed a contract with the Soviet nuclear company Atomenergoexport for two VVER-440 reactors, each delivering 440 MW of electrical power on the Gulf of Sirte. The reactors were intended to server a dual-use for electric power generation and seawater desalination. As Libya was discontent with the technology the USSR wanted to provide them with, the Belgian nuclear company Belgonucleaire was asked to take over the contract. However, due to objection from the United States for concerns regarding misuse of nuclear weapons development, Belgonucleaire refused and Libya asked the USSR again. In the end, the project was stopped during its planning phase in 1986.
In 2006 Libya and France signed an agreement on peaceful uses of atomic energy, and in July 2007, they signed a memorandum of understanding related to building a mid-sized nuclear plant with Areva reactor for seawater desalination. This deal was opposed by Germany. This was followed by a memorandum with Canada, to share nuclear medicine, desalinization technology and co-operation over nuclear energy research. 
In 2010 Libya confirmed that it intended to create a nuclear energy sector.

Nuclear energy in South Africa

__NOTOC__
South Africa is the only country in Africa with a commercial nuclear power plant.
Two reactors located at the Koeberg nuclear power station accounts for around 5% of South Africa's electricity production. Spent fuel is disposed of at Vaalputs Radioactive Waste Disposal Facility in the Northern Cape.
The SAFARI-1 tank in pool research reactor is located at the Pelindaba nuclear research centre in Gauteng
New build.
The 2010 Integrated Resource Plan envisages building 9,600 MWe of new nuclear power capacity, by a programme of between six and eight new nuclear power plants. The government is considering the practicality and financing of such a programme.
In 2008 Max Lee, CEO of Eskom, announced Eskom plans to build 20 GW of nuclear power by 2025; the first station with a capacity of between 3,300 and 4,000 MW could be completed by 2017. However the investment decision to go ahead with this was not made.
Until 2010 South Africa had an expansion policy based upon the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR), but government financing was withdrawn because of missed deadlines and lack of customers.
Several groups, including Earthlife Africa and Koeberg Alert, oppose these plans.

Following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, a related series of nuclear accidents resulted in a serious fire at the plant's unit 4 on 15 March 2011, these 50 employees remained on-site after 750 other workers were evacuated.
After TEPCO management proposed withdrawing all its employees from the plant on 14 March, additional manpower was deployed from around Japan. Some workers traveled on clear roads by convoy from Tokyo. When they arrived, hundreds of firemen, SDF personnel and employees of TEPCO, convened 20 km from the plant and debated how to best stabilize the plant. On the night of 15 March, these workers joined the original Fukushima 50. Despite the incorrect figure of workers, the Fukushima 50 has remained the pseudonym used by media to refer to the group of workers at Fukushima reflecting the solitary nature of the role.
The number of the workers involved rose to 580 on the morning of 18 March as staff from the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant and workers installing the new power line joined in. More than 1,000 workers, firefighters and soldiers were toiling at the site on 23 March. The Fukushima 50 were drawn from Toshiba, Hitachi, Kajima, firefighters from Tokyo, Osaka, Yokohama, Kawasaki, Nagoya and Kyoto, TEPCO and its subsidiaries such as Kandenko, TEP Industry and TEP Environmental Engineering, and many small-to-mid-size companies that have contracts with these big companies.
Over 20 workers had been injured by 18 March, including one who was exposed to a large amount of ionizing radiation when the worker tried to vent vapour from a valve of the containment building. Three more workers were exposed to radiation over 100 mSv, and two of them were sent to a hospital due to beta burns on 24 March. Two other workers, Kazuhiko Kokubo, 24, and Yoshiki Terashima, 21, were killed by the tsunami while conducting emergency repairs immediately after the quake. Their bodies were found on 30 March.
The workers and volunteers were assigned the mission of stabilizing the reactors.
Their activities included assessing the damage and radiation levels caused by the explosions, cooling stricken reactors with seawater and preventing any risk of fire. These workers remained on-site despite risks of radiation poisoning. Levels of radiation on site are far higher than in the 20 km exclusion zone and media outlets reported that the severity of the situation could have grave implications on their future health, with possibly fatal consequences for the workers. On 18 March, according to Prime Minister Naoto Kan the workers were "prepared for death".
A day before the unit 4 fire, a complete withdrawal proposed by TEPCO was rejected by the prime minister, to continue attempts at bringing the reactors under control during the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.
Conditions.
Working environment.
The workers ate and slept in shifts in a two-story earthquake-resistant building at the center of the complex constructed in July 2010, about "the size of an average living room."
During some work, in high radiation areas, the workers were limited to 15-minute sessions inside the damaged buildings.
Radiation.
The international limit for radiation exposure for nuclear workers is 20 millisievert (20 mSv, or 2 rem) per year, averaged over five years, with a limit of 50 mSv in any one year, however for workers performing emergency services United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance on dose limits is 100 mSv when "protecting valuable property" and 250 mSv when the activity is "life saving or protection of large populations."
Prior to the accident, the maximum permissible dose for Japanese nuclear workers was 100 mSv in any one year, but on 15 March 2011, the Japanese Health and Labor Ministry enforced the permitted 250 mSv limit, in light of the situation at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant. However, the workers at Fukushima plant declined the elevated 250 mSv limit and kept adopting the previous 100 mSv. Tokyo Enesys, a TEPCO's subsidiary, adopts 80 mSv to manage the radiation level monitoring with some buffer. Kandenko, Kajima and Taisei Corporation adopted 100 mSv. Hitachi rewrote internal rule as 200 mSv. TEPCO decided to move workers around 200mSv to low-radiated site while its subsidiaries, Tokyo Enesys and Kandenko, adopted limits around 100mSv. Over 30 workers were radiated beyond 100 mSv by 23 April 2011.
According to the Guardian, the Fukushima workers have to be wary of radiation spiking—a sudden and unforeseen rise in radiation. This threat forced to evacuate the workers for a short period of time on the morning of Tuesday 15 March 2011 when radiation detected at Fukushima rose to approximately 1000 mSv/h, the highest level of radiation detected at any point of time during the accident at the plant.
The workers wore hazmat suits and hazmat masks, carrying dosimeters that alerted at 80 millisieverts. Each worker had to stop the operation once the dosimeter alerted. According to TEPCO, seven TEPCO workers were exposed to radiation over the limit of 100 millisievert by the morning of 20 March.
In context, immediate symptoms become apparent if exposed to above 250 mSv per day. Symptoms include nausea and loss of appetite as well as damage to bone marrow, lymph nodes and the spleen. Generally, these symptoms become more severe and noticeable in the 1000 to 3000 mSv bracket with recovery probable, but not assured. New and more serious symptoms appear above 3000 mSv such as peeling of the skin, hemorrhaging and sterility with death if left untreated.
Explosion.
The Fukushima 50 were present when an explosion and fire occurred at the Unit 4 reactor. There is confusion as to what extent radiation may have been released as a result of this incident. The Japanese government appears reluctant to divulge too much information about the situation for fear of causing panic.
Number of workers.
Originally there were approximately 800 workers on 11 March 2011, the day the earthquake and tsunami struck. On 15 March, workers deemed non-essential were withdrawn by the Tokyo Electric Power Company. A total of around 750 workers left due to increased risk and consequently left around 50. It was on this day that the media started to call the remaining workers the "Fukushima 50".
However, on the morning of the 16 March the remaining workers had to be evacuated for a brief period of time due to a radiation spike which was detected which could be harmful to the workers' health. It was reported that when they returned to the plant, a further 130 or so workers joined their colleagues to total of around 180 to stabilize the reactors. The number of workers rose to 580 on the morning of the 18 March. By 12 April, approximately 700 workers were working on-site.
By 21 March 2011, Toshiba had sent a 100-strong team to two Fukushima plants as part of a task-force of 700 Toshiba workers organized at Toshiba's Isogo Engineering Centre to defuse the nuclear crisis, and Hitachi had dispatched 120 to Fukushima I and formed a 1000-strong task force.
Referring to the original 50 workers, nuclear researcher Dr. Eric Hall opined that they were likely to be older, and unlikely to have further children, so the long-term effects of exposure to high-levels of ionizing radiation would be less likely to appear before a natural death. Some younger workers were injured and young Osaka firefighters were operating at the site. A group of 250 skilled senior citizens volunteered to work in the radioactive environment, citing reduced harm to them.
On 10 July 2013, Masao Yoshida, leader of the Fukushima 50, died of esophageal cancer. TEPCO stated this form of cancer was unlikely related to the event at Fukushima since it usually takes 5–10 years to develop.
Injury.
Over 20 workers were injured by 18 March. Three workers were exposed to radiation and two were rushed to a hospital with up to 180 mSv, which is less than the maximum 250 mSv that the government allowed for workers at the plant. Both workers, one in his twenties and one in his thirties, were from Kandenko and were regular workers at Fukushima II nuclear power plant. Another worker was from a contract company of Kandenko.
Reaction of media and public.
Media outlets lauded the remaining workers' bravery, and called them "heroes", and as a result they have become known in the media as the "Fukushima 50". "France 24" called them "Japan's faceless heroes", British newspaper, "The Guardian" wrote: "Other nuclear power employees, as well as the wider population, can only look on in admiration". They have been compared to the Forty-seven Ronin. In Hong Kong, a group of netizens at HKGolden Forum dedicated Cantonese and Japanese lyrics based on a Cantopop song, entitled "福島烈士─向福島50人致敬" ("Deadly Heroes of Fukushima - Tribute to the Fukushima Fifty"), to the workers.
According to Robert Hetkämper, a correspondent for the German television network ARD, the label "Fukushima 50" was invented by a foreign newspaper, and then was imported by the Japanese media. The "Fukushima 50" would include engineers as well as unskilled workers, and there would be grounds to suspect that many workers were not really aware of the dangers of their assignment.
Awards.
On 7 September 2011, the "Fukushima Heroes" were honored with the Prince of Asturias Award for Peace, an award given by the Crown Prince of Spain.

Kiisortoqia

Kiisortoqia soperi is a species of arthropod from the Early Cambrian Sirius Passet Lagerstätte in Greenland. Its antennulae resemble anomalocaridid great appendages.
Morphology.
The body of "K. soperi" consisted of a simple head shield, 16 trunk segments (tergites) and a tail plate. The species reached a length of and was in outward appearance almost elliptical, about twice as long as wide, with the widest point in the front third of the body at the 3rd to 5th tergite.
The head plate was simple, convex in shape, wider than long, and represented about 20% of the total body length. The tergites were short, about five times as wide as long, and the rear edge of each tergite to overshadow the following by about a fifth of its length. The tergites 1–5 all had about the same width, the following tergites have been coming back ever narrower. In the middle of an axis was clearly seen, which constituted about half the width of a tergite and gave him a three-lobed shape. At the lateral ends of each tergite existed rearwardly longer and longer spines. The tiny tail was semi-circular, about half as long as wide; and the front half had to two-thirds of the tail shield also has a three-lobed shape.
The first segment bore a ventral pair of large limbs, known as the antennule, which are about half to two-thirds as long as the body. They consisted of a cylindrical stem and about 15 segments. The segments had a flat outer side and two widely spaced spines.
The other limbs – three pairs in the head region shield and 16 on the body segments – composed of two branches. The basipod was long, trapezoid-shaped and had two rows with different numbers of spines. The exopods were paddle-like lobes, which were fringed with bristles. The length was little more than two thirds of the length of the endopodite.
Its gut is occasionally preserved in three dimensions, perhaps in phosophate.
Ecology.
It is believed that "Kiisortoqia" was a predatory swimmer. The large paddle-like exopods were probably suitable for swimming. With its robust antennule, "K. soperi" could capture prey, probably using its prickly basipods to bring them to its mouth.
Etymology.
The name of the genus is derived from the Greenlandic word "", meaning "predator" or "hunter". The specific epithet is in honor of Norman John (Jack) Soper who, together with A. K. Higgins, discovered the Sirius Passet fauna and collected the first fossils from the locality.
Distribution.
More than 170 specimens of the species were recovered in the course of several expeditions between 1985 and 2006 from the Lower Cambrian Sirius Passet Konservat-Lagerstätte, in Peary Land, northern Greenland. The specimens are usually more or less completely preserved: disarticulated fossils were not discovered.
Systematic position.
"Kiisortoqia soperi" possesses three crown-arthropod homologies: a head shield with three pairs of limbs, plus the antennula; postantennular biramous limbs; and flap-like exopods fringed with setae. An exact position within the arthropods, however, cannot be determined, due to the possible lack of eyes and the ambiguous shape of the tail plate. A possible synapomorphy of the antennules with the chelicerates is purely speculative. A later cladistic analysis resolved "Kiisortoqia" as sister to the rest of crown-group arthropods studied.

Brenntag

Brenntag AG is a German chemical distribution company which was founded in 1874 in Berlin, and which currently operates in more than 70 countries worldwide. The company is headquartered in Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany. Brenntag is the global market leader in full-line chemical distribution. 
History.
In 1874 Philipp Mühsam founds an egg wholesale business in Berlin that later becomes Brenntag. In 1912 Brenntag enters into the chemical distribution business. 
From the first expansion beyond Germany in 1966, through the entry into the U.S. market in the early 1970s, to their accelerated growth worldwide throughout the past two decades, much of the growth has been enabled by selective acquisitions in key growth areas around the world. 
In the eighties the company continued to expand in the USA through acquisitions of several distribution companies. In the following decade Brenntag expands within Europe through acquisitions and Joint Ventures. By acquiring Holland Chemical International, then the fifth largest chemical distributor worldwide, in 2000 Brenntag gained market shares in Scandinavia, Eastern Europe and USA and became market leader in Latin America. In the following ten years the company acquired companies worldwide and therewith expanded its network and market shares. At the same time new chemical distribution centers were built at strategic locations.
The most recent milestone acquisition was the purchase in late 2008 of the distribution business of Rhodia, giving Brenntag the first distribution presence in the Asia Pacific region. In 2010 and 2011 Brenntag further expanded its market presence in the region significantly by acquiring EAC Industrial Ingredients Ltd. A/S and Zhong Yung (International) Chemical Ltd.

Rotten Rita

Rotten Rita (real name Kenneth Rapp), was an influential denizen of Andy Warhol's The Factory and was sometimes referred to as "The Mayor" there. Although he worked by day in a fabric store, he spent many nights at the Factory bringing his unique influences to encourage others to become artists. He was an opera aficionado, and also an alleged amphetamine dealer (and user), and he touched the lives of many members of Warhol's artist collective. He was particularly close to another member, Brigid Berlin.
Rapp's death in late 1991 (together with that of songwriter Doc Pomus by cancer) inspired Lou Reed, another famous Factory denizen, to compose his 1992 album "Magic and Loss". Reed also makes mention of Rotten Rita in the song "Halloween Parade" on the 1989 album "New York".

Pierre Cordier

Pierre Cordier (born January 28, 1933 in Brussels), also known as the father of the chemigram, is a Belgian artist. He is considered the pioneer of the chemigram and of its development as a means of artistic expression.
Childhood and education.
Cordirn into a family of Franco-Belgian industrialists specializing in cosmetic products, including nail polish. When he was young he became interested in jazz. The improvisational freedom of this music is reflected in his works.
The chemigram.
In 1952 he made an important acquaintance: Georges Brassens, the poet and singer, who was unknown at the time. He recorded and photographed him. Brassens left a deep influence on Cordier and encouraged him to continue exploring the "unfrequented steep road" that he had chosen.
After studying political science at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, Cordier completed his military service in Germany in 1956. It was there that a new pathway opened up for him: the chemigram.
On November 10, 1956, writing a dedication with nail polish on photographic paper to a young German woman named Erika, Pierre Cordier discovered what he later called the chemigram. This technique, which "combines the physics of painting (varnish, oil, wax) and the chemistry of photography (photosensitive emulsion, developer, and fixer), without the use of a camera or enlarger, and in full light", became for him a source of experiments and a plastic language. It opened up a new visual space at the boundaries of painting, photography, and writing, allowing him "to create entrancing images impossible to realize by any other means. Working like a painter, he replaces the canvas with photographic paper." Alongside his visual research, he continued in his career as a professional photographer, finally abandoning it in 1967. Several important figures in the arts became interested in these new visual possibilities, among them Otto Steinert (1915–1978), professor and founder of the Subjektive Fotografie movement. Thanks to his encouragement, Cordier produced many chemigrams as well as photographic self-portraits. These works were exhibited in 1958 during the Subjektive Fotografie 3 exhibition in Cologne.
The years 1970, 1980 & 2000.
From 1960s until the mid-1970s Cordier continued his experiments: chromatic research (1961), the photo-chemigram (1963), and magical varnish (1972). He also produced some experimental films and became a lecturer at the École nationale des arts visuels in Brussels from 1965 to 1998. At a time when artistic photography was not really accepted in Europe, the exhibition he had (with Denis Brihat and Jean-Pierre Sudre) at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1967 was a major event. The next year he was one of the founders, with Gottfried Jäger, of the Generative Fotografie movement in Germany. His meeting with Aaron Siskind in 1977 was crucial: this great American photographer became his spiritual father and introduced him to many important figures in the New Bauhaus circle of Chicago.
The end of the seventies was an especially fruitful period of exhibits and contacts, and also marked his technical mastery of the chemigram technique. The year 1988 was emblematic of this maturity, with a retrospective of the artist’s work at the Museum of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels, the creation of a monumental piece for the Brussels subway, and his induction into the Académie royale de Belgique. He resided in the south of France from 1992 to 2007, gathering material for the publication of a monograph which synthesizes fifty years of research. Since its publication in 2007, the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Victoria & Albert Museum in London have each acquired five chemigrams for their collections. Those at the Victoria and Albert Museum were on view from October, 2010 until February, 2011.
Arising from hybrid techniques, the work of Pierre Cordier has always been difficult to classify, and raises the question of affiliation from an art-historical point of view. Yet an authentic personal mythology emerges, whose indecipherable language would be key to providing the answer.

Aratz-aizkorri

Aratz-aizkorri is the second-largest natural park in the Basque Country, extending over (14,626, 16,000, or 19,400 hectares, depending on which source you use) in the Aizkorri-Aratz Mountain Range. Included in the park are the highest summits (Aitxuri, 1,551 m) in the Cantabrian-Mediterranean watershed, which together form a massif that is a centre for Basque mountaineering. Declared a natural park in 2006, the area contains limestone ridge-and-valley and siliceous intrusion biomes.
Location.
This natural park is situated in the Basque Country, Spain. It was declared a natural park in 2006. It is located in the provinces of Guipuzcoa (80 per cent) and Alava (20 per cent). Four towns in the province of Alava are within the park – Asparrena, Zalduondo, San Millán/Donemiliaga, and Barrundia – and seven of Guipuzcoa: Leintz-Gatzaga, Eskoriatza, Aretxabaleta, Oñati, Legazpi, Zerain, and Zegama. The park includes all the lands of the "Parzonería General de Guipúzcoa y Álava".
Weather.
The park has a humid climate, with no drought in the summer, because of the altitude. The northern slope is wetter than the southern. The climate varies from area to area due to differences in the terrain. The temperature is mild, but the winters are cold.
Landscape.
Although the mountains are the most noticeable characteristic of the park, the area has vegetation, fauna, and phenomena not present in other mountainous areas.
Mountains.
The park is in a mountain area near the Aralar Range, which is one of the corridors linking the Pyrenees to the Cantabrian Mountains. Highlights include the rock wall that extends between the mountains of Aloña and Aratz. The highest altitudes of the Basque Autonomous Community are the peaks of Aitxuri (1,551 metres) and Aizkorri (1,544 metres).
Substrates, vegetation and phenomena.
The substrate of the area consists of urgonian limestone, which create karstic phenomena such as ridges, sinkholes, torques, and ravines. Notable formations include the basin of La Lece, the tunnel of San Adrián, Urbia's depression, and Arantzazu's ravine.
In Elguea-Urkilla the substrate changes; sandstones and clays are present. In the natural park some magnificent large autochthonous forests are conserved, which contain beech and white oak ("Quercus petraea"). Rare vegetation is present at higher altitudes, such as mountain meadows and heather, and fruits, which are the food of the menhaden sheep.
Fauna.
The fauna associated with the forest are the black woodpecker ("Dryocopus martius"), eagles, owls, the vultures, and more than 20 species that are protected under European legislation. Amphibians present in the ponds include the triton and the Iberian Frog. Mammals include the bobcat and the marten.
Pine marten.
This animal is a mustelid, and is native to Northern Europe. Its body is up to , and its bushy tail can be . Males are slightly larger than females; on average a marten weighs around . Their fur is usually light to dark brown and grows longer and silkier during the winter months. They have a cream to yellow coloured "bib" marking on their throats.
Nocturnal and somewhat arboreal in habit, it eats small mammals, small birds, insects, and frogs. They also eat fruits and eggs of birds. Martens are occasional prey of eagles, owls, and foxes. In captivity they live up to 18 years, in the wild eight to ten years. They reach sexual maturity at two to three years. Their young, with a birth-weight of approximately 30 grams, are usually born in March or April after a seven-month-long gestation period, in litters of one to five.
Iberian frog.
The Iberian frog or "Rana Patilarga", "Rana iberica", is a species of frog in the Ranidae family.
It is native and limited to Portugal and Spain. Its natural habitats are rivers, intermittent rivers, and swamps.
Archaeological traces.
Because of the karstic properties of the rock, there are many caves in the park. Most of them, including Arrikrutz and Aizkirri, have prehistoric deposits, including the remains of lions and bears. The cave at Otzaurte links Alava and Guipuzcoa. A small furnace to smelt iron from the Bronze Age has been found in the area.
In some parts of the park, it is still possible to view the Roman road to Vitoria-Gasteiz, and it is one of the trails of the Camino de Santiago. There are also roads extant from the Middle Ages, such as San Adrian's road.
Amenities for tourists.
The nearest airport is Foronda (Vitoria Airport). The airport at Loiu, Vizcaya, is also nearby. The road to the park is clearly marked, and tourist accommodations are available. Restaurants and cafes are on site.

Berard Haile

Father Berard Haile (1874-1961), O.F.M., was a Franciscan priest and one of the foremost authorities on Navajo anthropology. He entered the Franciscan
Order in 1891 and was ordained a priest on June 29, 1898. He served at the Franciscan mission to the Navajo at St. Michaels, Arizona, and at other missions in the Southwest, from 1901 to 1954, where he developed an interest in Navajo language and culture. He helped devise a written alphabet of the Navajo language and published a four volume work on learning Navajo. In 1929 Haile attended the Catholic University of America and obtained a Master's Degree. He then accepted the position of Research Associate in Anthropology at the University of Chicago. He made a field trip with Edward Sapir through Navajo land that was sponsored by the Laboratory of Anthropology at Santa Fe, New Mexico. Haile devised a new Navajo alphabet containing over sixty characters. His other major work dealt with the creation story of the Navajo, Diné Bahaneʼ.
Haile was awarded a Doctor of Letters degree from St. Bonaventure University in 1951, and a Doctor of Laws degree in 1952 from the University of New Mexico. In 1953 the Navajo Tribal Council passed a resolution which read in part: "Father Berard Haile has spent his life among the Navajo people learning to know and understand us and our religion, and has, more than any other living non-Indian, through close contact with Navajos and the medicine men of our tribe and by his indefatigable labor, reduced our language to written form and succeeded in preserving for future generations the knowledge of the Navajo history and religion."

Miodrag Jokić

Miodrag Jokić (born 25 February 1935) was the last commander of the Yugoslav Navy. The International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) sentenced him to 7 years in prison for murder, cruel treatment, attacks on civilians, devastation, unlawful attacks on civilian objects, destruction or wilful damage done to institutions in Dubrovnik.
Jokić was born in Serbia and educated in the Yugoslav military-naval academy. In 1991, after serving as an officer for a number of years, he was promoted to Vice Admiral and then to the Commander of the 9th VPS of the Yugoslav navy. After Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia that year, the Yugoslav Army invaded the Dubrovnik area and started a three-month siege in order to keep that territory under Yugoslav control. The siege failed and the army had to retreat, while the international community condemned the attacks.
In 2001, the ICTY charged Jokić, Pavle Strugar, Milan Zec and Vladimir Kovačević on several counts. These included violations of the customs of war and attacks on the UNESCO heritage site of the Old Town. Strugar and Jokić voluntarily surrendered to the court, becoming the first Serbian or Montenegrin citizens to do so. His surrender sparked protests in Serbia.
On 1 April 2003, Jokić pleaded guilty to six counts in his second indictment and thus no trial was necessary. He admitted his guilt and expressed his remorse for his actions in Dubrovnik:
The ICTY considered his remorse in openly admitting guilt as a mitigating factor and thus sentenced him to 7 years in prison. He also testified against his superior Strugar during his trial at the ICTY. In 2008, he was released from prison.

Uri International Vehicle &amp; Equipment Marketing

Uri International Vehicle & Equipment Marketing (Pty.) Ltd. is a car manufacturer located in Waltloo, South Africa since 2008 as a subsidiary of the defense contractor Ivema (Pty.) Ltd. 
The company Uri-Automobile was founded in 1995 by farmer "Ewert Smith". At his time the company was located in Witvlei, Namibia. Prior that time, he had used his small workshop for repairing trucks, passenger cars and motorcycles. At his time he planned to develop an offroad vehicle which will be suitable for the African bush. In 1995, after eight years of starting the development phase, he had finally realized his dream.
The vehicles of the Uri brand are all unique creations and available with different Toyota engines that supplies a power from 76 up to 95 hp. After his first presentation of the Uri on an African motor show, Ewert Smith has got a very large number of orders. So he had decided to open a second manufacturing plant for his offroad vehicle. 
In 2007 the company was taken over by the South African defense contractor Ivema. Since that time the Uri offroad vehicles are reserved for the South African market. In 2008, the parent company moved the headquarters of Uri-Automobiles and its manufacturing to its new location in Waltloo, South Africa.

University of Nijmegen (1655-1680)

The University of Nijmegen ("Kwartierlijke Academie van Nijmegen") was the first university in Nijmegen, Netherlands and existed between 1655 AD and approximately the year 1680.
It was founded as a "Illustre school" in 1655 and became a university in 1656. The local government supported the university and it became competitor for the University of Harderwijk as main university in the Gelders district. The Commanderie St. Jan became its accommodation and the university had professors like Petrus de Greve, Christopher Wittich, Johan Teyler and Gerhard Noodt. The university was in conflict with the universities in Holland because the ideas of René Descartes were spread. In 1672 the university was closed because of the French occupation. It reopened in 1674 but never recovered. The university was closed between 1678 and 1682. Attempts were made to reopen a university in Nijmegen which finally succeeded with the opening of the Catholic University in 1923.

History.
Originally, "Listapad" was conceived as a film festival of CIS and Baltic countries. As a rule those films which for some reason were not widely distributed but clearly illustrated the culture of different countries were selected.
That was the way the festival was held for the first time in November 1993. With time the festival grew, gained prestige and achieved international status in 2003. Then the films from Russia, Poland, USA, Iran, Serbia, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, China and Japan were brought to Minsk.
Listapad 2010.
In 2010, the festival appeared in a completely updated format. The Festival competition program was as follows:
"Masakra,” the film by Belarusian director Andrei Kudinenko was presented in the main competition of feature films.
At the XVII MIFF Listapad, for the first time the winner was determined by the professional jury, not the viewers. It was made because viewers can’t see all the competition films, at best they get acquainted with 30% of the films, and this is biased. Before making a decision the professional jury is sure to see all the films.

List of monuments of the Roman Forum

This List of monuments of the Roman Forum ("Forum Romanum") includes existing and former buildings, memorials and other built structures in the famous Roman public plaza during its 1,400 years of active use (8th century BC — ca 600 AD). It is divided into three categories: (1) those ancient structures that can be seen today as ruins or reconstructions; (2) ancient structures that have vanished or exist only as fragments; and (3) churches of the later, Christian era.
Many of the Forum's monuments were originally built in the periods of the Kingdom (753 BC-509 BC) and the Republic (509 BC-27 BC), although most were destroyed and rebuilt several times. The existing ruins generally date from the Imperial period (27 BC - 476 AD).

Metacrias strategica

Metacrias strategica is a species of moth of the Arctiidae family. It is found in New Zealand, where it is known from the southern part of the South Island. It is found from coastal and forest-edge sites to the montane zone.
Adults males are brightly coloured and diurnal, while females are buff coloured and extremely short-winged. They remain within their cocoon for mating and egg-laying.
The larvae are polyphagous on grasses and herbs. They are hairy and brown. The larvae appear to overwinter in the larval and pupal stages, the adults having only a very brief life span of approximately 21 days confined to the summer months. Early instars feed during warm periods. The last larval instar lives in the cold winter months of June to August and is inactive and overwinters until warmer spring weather occurs. Because of individual variations in the duration of the larval instars, pupae too may overwinter.

Palazzo Castiglioni (Milan)

Palazzo Castiglioni is an Art Nouveau palace of Milan, northern Italy. It was designed by Giuseppe Sommaruga and built between 1901 and 1903. The rusticated blocks of the basement imitate a natural rocky shape, while the rest of the decorations are inspired by 18th century stuccos. The building is now used as the seat of the Unione Commercianti di Milano (Traders' Union of Milan).
History.
The palace was built for entrepreneur Ermengildo Castiglioni, who chose architect Giuseppe Sommaruga because of his anticonventional solutions. Castiglioni wanted the palace to reflect his wealth and "grandeur"; the choice of the Art Nouveau, a new and "trendy" style, for a building that would be located in the historic centre of Milan, was intended by Castiglioni and Sommaruga as a sort of challenge to the Milanese conservative élite. The most provocative element of the original design turned out to be a couple of nude female statues, by Ernesto Bazzaro, decorating the facade; these raised such turmoil that the local newspaper "Guerin Meschino" published a series of satyrical illustrations on them, and the Milanese population renamed the palace "Cà di ciapp" (in Milanese, "house of buttocks"). The statues, that were intended to represented "Peace" and "Industry", were eventually removed and are now used as decorations of another Milanese palace also by Sommaruga, Villa Faccanoni.

Problematische Naturen

Problematische Naturen (“Problematical Natures,” 1861; translated into English as “Problematic Characters,” by Prof. Schele de Vere, New York, 1869) was a popular novel written by German novelist Friedrich Spielhagen exploring German personalities from around the time of the Revolutions of 1848.
Motivations.
Like Freytag and Paul Heyse, Friedrich Spielhagen was chiefly concerned, in his novels, with defining the warring elements of German character and the opposing springs of German action in the period before and after the revolution of 1848. Like Freytag and Heyse, Spielhagen saw clearly the dangers that threatened the country, politically, religiously and morally from a reactionary aristocracy; like Heyse and unlike Freytag he saw the hope of the nation in the spread of an enlightened democracy rather than in a spiritual renaissance of the ruling classes.
Description.
The hero of "Problematische Naturen", Oswald Stein, is the mouthpiece for Spielhagen's revolutionary social theories. He is modeled after those characters of whom Goethe wrote “There are problematical natures that do not fit into any situation and who remain always unsatisfied. For them there arises a terrible conflict that consumes life without enjoyment.”
For Spielhagen, the conflict itself, even though it ends in defeat, is victory; the mere struggle against the domination of dead ideas is progress. For such a philosophy, there could be no better historical background than the Germany of 1848 and after, and "Problematische Naturen" with its sequel "Durch Nacht zum Licht" (1862), — although it squanders material for half a dozen novels, idealizes Teutonic morbidity, and forsakes art for tendency, — tells with remarkable vividness the story of the men and women who lived and thought and fought for freedom in Germany's day of hope.
Further reading.
A notable description of the literature of this period is to be found in Julian Schmidt's "Geschichte der Deutschen Literatur".

Piya Tu Ab To Aaja

"Piya Tu Ab To Aaja" (Hindi: पिया तू अब तो आजा, English: Come to me now, my love) is a song from the 1971 Hindi film "Caravan". It is considered the quintessential cabaret item number by Helen. The song was sung by Asha Bhosle and R.D. Burman. It was composed by R.D. Burman with lyrics by Majrooh Sultanpuri. Music scholar Nilanjana Bhattacharjya identified "Piya Tu Ab To Aaja" as one of the culturally important Hindi film songs. The song has also been called "the catalyst" that made "Asha the queen of cabaret numbers".
Music Video.
The song was performed by Helen, who is known for doing item numbers in Bollywood films of the 1960s and 1970s. It is a highly suggestive song with Asha Bhosle breathing quickly at intervals, giving it an orgasmic sound. In the film, Helen performs the provocative dance in front of a large audience, including Sunita (played by actress Asha Parekh) who has just discovered that Monica (Helen) and her husband are having an affair. The picturisation is typical of the item numbers of the era portraying a "vamp" character who dances seductively for a nightclub audience.
Remakes.
The song was later released as part of the video "Raat Ki Rani" (1987), a compilation of Helen's different cabaret numbers. Asha Bhosle recorded a new version in 2003 for the Kronos Quartet album "You've Stolen My Heart: Songs from R.D. Burman's Bollywood". It also appears on the compilation album The Very Best of Asha Bhosle, The Queen of Bollywood. Composer Leslie Lewis released a remix of the song on his 2003 album "Special Appointment Club Hits" while R.P. Patnaik produced a Telugu version for the 2008 film "Swagatam". Pritam also sampled it for his song "Parda" on the "Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai" soundtrack. "Piya Tu Ab to Aaja" is also a frequent choice of television performers. In 2008, actress Amrita Arora danced to the song on the reality programme "Chhote Ustaad". Amrita Moitra, a contestant on Zee TV's "Dance India Dance", performed a mujra version of the song during the second season. The number is referenced briefly during the song "Dhoom Tanaa" from "Om Shanti Om" when Deepika Padukone, dressed in a gold bikini ensemble, dances in a cage.

List of bids for the Youth Olympics

The Youth Olympics are a multi-sport event organized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) every two years, alternating between Summer Youth Olympics and Winter Youth Olympics. Selection of the host city is done by postal voting by the members of the IOC four to five years prior to the tournament, in which the IOC members vote between candidate cities which have submitted bids. Bids for the first four games have been made by 15 cities in 14 countries.
The bid process consists of two rounds. First, cities and national Olympic committees (NOCs) may show their interest and submit a preliminary bid, becoming applicant cities. Through analysis of the questionnaires, the IOC gave a weighted-average score to each city based on the scores obtained in each of the questionnaire's eleven themes: political and social support, general infrastructure, sports venues, Olympic Village, environment, accommodation, transport, security, past experience, finance, and legacy. IOC's Executive Committee then selects a short-list of candidate cities. The candidate cities are investigated by the IOC Evaluation Committee, who make an evaluation report. These submit a more extensive bid book and are subject to additional evaluation, which is presented to the IOC members. Voting occurs as an exhaustive ballot by mail, which may occur through multiple rounds until a single city holds a majority of the votes. IOC members from a candidate NOC may not vote in any round while their country remains in the election. The first two selections were done by postal votes; since the selection for the 2014 Games, voting has been done at an IOC Session.
Poznań and Lillehammer are the only two cities to have applied for two games: Poznań for the Summer Games and Lillehammer for the Winter Games. China is the only country to have applied for both Summer and Winter Games, with Harbin failing the 2012 Winter bid, while Nanjing succeeded at the 2014 Summer bid.

The following is a list of bids for the Summer Olympics, sorted by year. It consists of the year the games were held or scheduled to be held, the date the decision was made, the city and country which issued the bid, the votes for each voting round, and the ultimate host of the games. The bid listed first for each games is the one selected by the IOC. "SL" indicates that the city made the short-list, but withdrew before the voting took place.

Saviour Church on Nereditsa

The Saviour Church on Nereditsa (, Tserkov Spasa na Nereditse) is an orthodox church built in 1198. It is one of Russia's oldest churches. The Transfiguration Church, located in Novgorodsky District of Novgorod Oblast, Russia, south of Veliky Novgorod in the village of Spas-Nereditsy on the right bank of the Maly Volkhovets River on a small Nereditsa Hill next to the Rurik hillfort.
The Saviour Church on Nereditsa is on the World Heritage list as a part of object 604 Historic Monuments of Novgorod and Surroundings. The building has been designated an architectural monument of federal significance (#5310113002).
History.
The church was founded in 1198 by Prince Yaroslav Vsevolodovich and painted with frescoes in 1199. The church was located outside the city of Novgorod but close to the residence of the prince, and the church was regarded by the prince as the place for his future tomb. In 1903-1904 it was measured and extensively restored by Pyotr Pokryshkin.
During World War II the church was located on the front line between 1941 and 1943 and was destroyed. It was subsequently restored, however, most of the frescoes were lost and are currently known because the pre-war photos exist.
Architecture.
The small stone church is built as a cube and has one dome. It is based on four pillars and has three apses at the eastern side. The type of a small church was developed in Novgorod in the end of the 12th century, and there are several churches of this type, in Novgorod and in Staraya Ladoga.
Frescoes.
The frescoes were created by eight to ten artists. They covered all the interior of the church, including the pillars, the walls, the ceiling, and the dome. There is no apparent system in creating the frescoes. Possible, the painters did nbot know each other and had different styles. In particular, normally a fresco of Christ the Saviour should be painted in the dome. However, for the Saviour Church on Nereditsa, the dome was occupied by the Ascencion. Christ was painted in the dome in Byzantine Empire already in the 9th century, and painting other frescoes in the dome was at the time the sign that the church belongs to a highly peripheral region. The most impressive fresco in the church was considered to be the Last Judgment, painted over the whole western wall. Only fragments of this fresco survived. In 1246, a fresco portrayed Prince Yaroslav Vsevolodovich was painted in the southern wall.

43zla

43zla is a Serbian hip-hop group from Kotež, a neighbourhood in Belgrade, Serbia. The group's original line-up was "Timbe" and "Ajs Nigrutin" (members of the group Bad Copy). Their first singles were ""1,2 akcija"", ""Kontrabas"" and ""De je kesa"".
Later, four more musicians, "Bvana", "Moskri", "Mikri Maus" and "Eufrat" joined the group.
Origin of the name.
43 is the number of the bus that frequents Kotež, the part of Belgrade where some of the members (Timbe, Ajs and Eufrat) live and the others (Bvana, Mikri Maus) like to hang out. The suffix ""zla"" means "evils" in Serbian. Phonetically, the band's name is pronounced "chetres-tree-zla" in Serbian. It has double meaning, since the "ree-zla" part (rizla) means smoking paper, so in Serbian slang it means 40 rizlas (""Četr'est rizla"") or 43 evils (Četr'es tri zla). 
It was one album project which involved all the most popular hip hop MCs and bands from Serbia, such as Bad Copy, Beogradski Sindikat and Prti Bee Gee.

Thomas Lynch (governor)

Sir Thomas Lynch (died 1684) was the English governor of Jamaica on three separate occasions in the 17th century. He was also chief justice of Jamaica for a time.
Life.
He was the son of Theophilus Lynch (born 1603), fourth son of William Lynch of Cranbrook in Kent, and of his wife Judith, eldest daughter of John Aylmer. He served under Robert Venables in the army which went out to Jamaica in 1655. In January 1661, after a period back in England he was appointed provost-marshal of the island for life. 
In December 1662 Lynch was lieutenant-colonel of the 5th regiment of militia; in April 1663 was sworn in as a member of council, and in April 1664 elected president of the council in the absence of Sir Charles Lyttelton. In June 1664 Sir Thomas Modyford became governor, and Lynch was again sworn of the council. Shortly Modyford wrote to his brother, Sir James Modyford, then in England, asking him to get the Duke of Albemarle to appoint a sheriff, instead of a provost-marshal; but on 12 February 1665 Lynch wrote to Lord Arlington complaining that the governor had discharged him from the council and the office of chief justice without giving any public reason.
Lynch was then obliged to return to England. At the end of 1670 he was ordered to go out again to Jamaica, as lieutenant-governor, with authority to command in the absence of Modyford. The commission was repeated in January 1671, when Modyford was recalled, and at the same time he received a commission from James, Duke of York to be commander-in-chief of his majesty's ships in and about Jamaica. He was knighted at Whitehall Palace on 3 December 1670.
Jamaica's buccaneers had been encouraged by Modyford. Under Lynch they acted under the governor's commission, including Henry Morgan; and the king claimed his share of the Spanish plunder. Diplomatic complaints from the Spanish government, however, compelled the English government to give way. Lynch was recalled, apparently in 1676, and Lord Vaughan was sent out with orders to suppress the pirates and put an end to piracy. In 1682 Lynch was again sent out to Jamaica as governor and captain-general, with similar instructions regarding piracy, and these he carried out severely.
Lynch died, apparently in 1684, some time before the death of Charles II was known in the colony. He was buried in the cathedral of Jamaica, beneath a black marble slab.
Family.
Lynch married (1) Vere, daughter of Sir George Herbert, by whom he had a daughter Philadelphia, wife of Sir Thomas Cotton, bart., and (2) Mary, daughter of Thomas Temple of Frankton in Warwickshire, but does not seem to have left issue. His widow afterwards married his successor, Colonel Hender Molesworth.

<doc id="31201241" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31201241" title="Torrent poisoning">
Torrent poisoning

Torrent poisoning is intentionally sharing corrupt data or data with misleading file names using the BitTorrent protocol. This practice of uploading fake torrents is sometimes carried out by anti-piracy organisations as an attempt to prevent the peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing of copyrighted content, and to gather the IP addresses of downloaders.
Methods of attack.
Decoy insertion.
Decoy insertion (or content pollution) is a method by which corrupted versions of a particular file are inserted into the network. This deters users from finding an uncorrupted version and also increases distribution of the corrupted file. A malicious user pollutes the file by converting it into another format that is indistinguishable from uncorrupted files (e.g. it may have similar or same metadata). In order to entice users to download the decoys, malicious users may make the corrupted file available via high bandwidth connections. This method consumes a large amount of computing resources since the malicious server must respond to a large quantity of requests. As a result, queries return principally corrupted copies such as a blank file or executable files infected with a virus.
Index poisoning.
This method targets the index found in P2P file sharing systems. The index allows users to locate the IP addresses of desired content. Thus, this method of attack makes searching difficult for network users. The attacker inserts a large amount of invalid information into the index to prevent users from finding the correct resource. Invalid information could include random content identifiers or fake IP addresses and port numbers. When a user attempts to download the corrupted content, the server will fail to establish a connection due to the large volume of invalid information. Users will then waste time trying to establish a connection with bogus users thus increasing the average time it takes to download the file. The index poisoning attack requires less bandwidth and server resources than decoy insertion. Furthermore, the attacker does not have to transfer files nor respond to requests. For this reason, index poisoning requires less effort than other methods of attack.
Spoofing.
Some companies that disrupt P2P file sharing on behalf of content providers create their own software in order to launch attacks. MediaDefender have written their own program which directs users to non-existent locations via bogus search results. As users typically select one of the top five search results only, this method requires users to persevere beyond their initial failed attempts to locate the desired file. The idea is that many users will simply give up their search because of frustration.
Interdiction.
This method of attack prevents distributors from serving users and thus slows P2P file sharing. The attacker’s servers constantly connect to the desired file, which floods the provider’s upstream bandwidth and prevents other users from downloading the file.
Selective content poisoning.
Selective content poisoning (also known as proactive or discriminatory content poisoning) attempts to detect pirates while allowing legitimate users to continue to enjoy the service provided by an open P2P network. The protocol identifies a peer with its endpoint address while the file index format is changed to incorporate a digital signature. A peer authentication protocol can then establish the legitimacy of a peer when they download and upload files. Using identity based signatures, the system enables each peer to identify pirates without the need for communication with a central authority. The protocol then sends poisoned chunks to detected pirates requesting a copyright protected file only. If all legitimate users simply deny download requests from known pirates, pirates could usually accumulate clean chunks from colluders (paid peers who share content with others without authorization). However, this method of content poisoning forces pirates to discard even clean chunks, prolonging their download time.
Voluntary Collective Licensing and the Open Music Model are theoretical systems where users pay a subscription fee for access to a file-sharing network, and are able to legally download and distribute copyright content. Selective content poisoning could potentially be used here to limit access to legitimate and subscribed users, by providing poisoned content to non-subscribed users who attempt to illegitimately use the network.
Eclipse attack.
The eclipse attack (also known as routing-table poisoning), instead of poisoning the network, targets requesting peers directly. In this attack, the attacker takes over the peer’s routing table so that they are unable to communicate with any other peer except the attacker. As the attacker replicates the whole network for the targeted peer, they can manipulate them in a number of ways. For example, the attacker can specify which search results are returned. The attacker can also modify file comments. The peer’s requests can also be directed back into the network by the attacker and can also be modified.It also checks data randomly for any errors found in that.
Uncooperative-peer attack.
In this attack, the attacker joins the targeted swarm and establishes connections with many peers. However, the attacker never provides any chunks (authentic or otherwise) to the peers. A common version of this attack is the "chatty peer" attack. The attacker establishes connection with targeted peers via the required handshake message, followed by a message advertising that they have a number of available chunks. Not only does the attacker never provide any chunks, they also repeatedly resend the handshake and message. These attacks prevent downloads as, essentially, the peer wastes time dealing with the attacker, instead of downloading chunks from others.
Barriers to torrent poisoning.
There are several reasons why content providers and copyright holders may not choose torrent poisoning as a method for guarding their content. First, before injecting decoys, content providers have to normally monitor the BitTorrent network for signs that their content is being illegally shared (this includes watching for variations of files and files in compressed formats).
This process can be expensive and time-consuming. As a result, most poisoning is only continued for the first few months following a leak or release. Second, it is also unlikely that torrent poisoning can be successful in disrupting every illegal download.
Instead, the aim of content providers is to make illegal downloads statistically less likely to be clean and complete, in the hope that users will be discouraged from illegally downloading copyright material. Content providers and copyright holders may decide that the financial outlay is not worth the end result of their efforts.
Countermeasures.
The methods of attack described above are not particularly effective on their own, as for each measure effective countermeasures have evolved. These measures must be combined in order to have a significant impact on illegal peer-to-peer filesharing using BitTorrent protocols and Torrent files. 
Legal issues.
In September 2004, Altnet sued the Recording Industry Association of America, Overpeer, Loudeye, MediaSentry and others, claiming that their spoofing services violated Altnet's patent for a file identification method called TrueNames.
In 2005 the Finnish anti-piracy organisation Viralg claimed that their software, which uses a similar approach to spoofing, could be used to bring an end to illegal P2P file sharing.
The firm offered "total blocking of peer 2 peer sharing for your intellectual property" and claimed that its "patented virtual algorithm blocks out all illegal swapping of your data". as well as claiming that their approach was 99% effective. Despite these claims, the algorithm has not yet been tested with BitTorrent.
A group of Finnish musicians requested an investigation into the company, arguing that their software was effectively a virus and was in violation of Finnish law. The investigation was declined by Finnish police, and later by the Finnish parliamentary ombudsman.
In some jurisdictions, there have been concerns that content providers and copyright holders engaging in poisoning activities may be held liable for damages to user's computers. In the USA in 2002, Representative Howard Berman proposed the Peer To Peer Privacy Prevention Act, which would have granted immunity to copyright holders for taking steps to prevent the illegal distribution of their content (i.e. poisoning activities) on P2P networks, as long as they did not go as far as to harm the files stored on a P2P user's computer. However, the Bill died later in 2002 when the Congressional Term ended and has not been reintroduced.
High profile cases.
In 2005, it was reported that HBO was poisoning torrents of its show "Rome" by providing chunks of garbage data to users. HBO were also reported to have sent cease-and-desist letters to the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) of downloaders they believe have illegally downloaded episodes of "The Sopranos".
Although not targeted specifically at BitTorrent, Madonna's American Life album was an early example of content poisoning. Before the release of the album, tracks that appeared to be of similar length and file size to the real album tracks were leaked by the singer's record label. The tracks featured only a clip of Madonna saying "What the fuck do you think you're doing?" followed by minutes of silence.
Similarly, the band Barenaked Ladies released a number of tracks online in 2000 that appeared to be legitimate copies of tracks from the band's latest album. Each file contained a short sample of the song, followed by a clip of a band member saying, "Although you thought you were downloading our new single, what you were actually downloading is an advertisement for our new album.”
After a pirated copy of Michael Moore’s movie Sicko was uploaded online, it became a hit on P2P websites such as Pirate Bay. MediaDefender was hired to poison torrents using decoy insertion.
In an example of internet vigilantism, anti-piracy vigilantes have been known to create viruses that are distributed exclusively via P2P networks, and are designed to attack mp3s and other music files stored on a user's PC. The Nopir-B worm, which originated in France, poses as a DVD copying program and deletes all the mp3 files on a user's computer, regardless of whether or not they were legally obtained.
On October 19, 2007 Associated Press (AP) released information accusing the broadband service provider Comcast of “hindering” P2P file sharing traffic. Tests conducted by AP have shown that Comcast hindered the uploading of complete files to BitTorrent. The Federal Communications Commission conducted public hearings in response to the allegations. Comcast argued that it was regulating network traffic to enable reasonable downloading times for the majority of users. On August 21, 2008 the FCC issued an order which stated that Comcast's network management was unreasonable and that Comcast must terminate the use of its discriminatory network management by the end of the year. Comcast complied with the order and appealed. On June 6, 2010, the District Court of Appeals for the Columbia vacated the FCC order in Comcast Corp. v. FCC.

Ng Wah Catholic Secondary School

Ng Wah Catholic Secondary School (天主教伍華中學) is a boys' secondary school in San Po Kong, Wong Tai Sin, Hong Kong. Founded in 1965 by Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong.
History.
Established in 1965 as Sanpokong Catholic College, the school is a government subsidized grammar school for boys, under the sponsorship of the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong.
Before moving into the new premises, with consent of the school authority of Choi Hung Estate Catholic Secondary School (CHESS), CHECSS was partially used by Ng Wah School school in its first year of operation, with a total of 480 junior form students (S1 to S3) in 12 classes.
On 30 March 1966, the present site in San Po Kong were completed and were inaugurated by the then Governor of Hong Kong, Sir David Trench on 14 April 1966.
After a donation by Mr. Ng Ping Kin, an architect and Urban Councillor, the school was renamed Ng Wah College in commemoration of his father, Mr. Ng Wah (Chinese: 伍華). In the late 70's, the rooftop of the secondary school building was modified and became the 6th floor to accommodate the then expanding student population.
In 1986, three standard classrooms were also in place in the covered playground. Under the School Improvement Project scheme, a new six-storey annex was built connected the primary school building near Choi Hung Rd. in 2000. In the same year, the three classrooms in the covered playground were converted into a bigger multi-purpose Student Activity Room.
Starting from September 2002, the school was renamed as Ng Wah Catholic Secondary School in accordance with the naming system of schools under the sponsorship of the Hong Kong Catholic Diocese.
Motto.
The School Motto is Latin phrase "IN CONSILIO SAPIENTIA", which means "To think conscientiously and to discern with intelligence" in English.

Nuclear energy in Bangladesh

Bangladesh first considered building a nuclear power plant in 1961. Since then, several feasibility studies have been carried out, affirming the feasibility of the project. In 1963 the Ruppur site was selected. More recently, in 2001 Bangladesh adopted a national Nuclear Power Action Plan. On 24 June 2007, Bangladesh's government announced plans to build a nuclear power plant to meet electricity shortages.
In May 2010, Bangladesh signed a civilian nuclear agreement with the Russian Federation. Bangladesh also has framework agreements for peaceful nuclear energy applications with the US, France and China. Although the Ministry of Science and ICT, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources and Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) are working on the electric grid system integration, the demographics and circumstances present do raise the question if indeed Bangladesh can produce energy from nuclear sources.
In February 2011, Bangladesh reached an agreement with Russia to build the 2,000 megawatt (MW) Ruppur Nuclear Power Plant with two reactors, each of which will generate 1,200 MW of power. The nuclear power plant will be built at Ruppur, on the banks of the Padma River, in the Ishwardi subdistrict of Pabna, in the northwest of the country. The RNPP is estimated to cost up to US$2 billion, and start operating by 2021. The inter-governmental agreement (IGA) was officially signed on 2 November 2011.
On 29 May 2013 Bangladesh's prime minister declared that a second nuclear power plant will be constructed in an inland river island in southern region of the country.
Background.
For Bangladesh, which is a historically agrarian country, the agricultural sector has shrunk from over 30% in the 1980s to under 20% a decade into the millennium. On the other hand, industry is growing from under 20% in the 1980s to over 30% currently. With highly industry national economy, the generation of electricity will be linearly related to the national GDP. With lesser agriculture and more industry, not only more emissions will be given off to the atmosphere but lack of trees and plants will hinder any chance of carbon sequestration.
The underdeveloped and mismanaged energy infrastructure of Bangladesh has inhibited economic growth (See: Electricity sector in Bangladesh). With a derated capacity of around 5500 Megawatt (MW) on an installed rating of over 6000 MW, only around 4000 is actually available. With a maximum generation of 4500 MW in mid-2010 to 4700 MW in late 2010, the peak is anywhere from 5700 MW to 6000 MW and only about 40% to 48% of the total population have access to electricity. The per capita consumption of 218-230 kWh and the availability is the lower among any developing country in the world.
Current energy sources.
The main source of national energy is in its natural gas reserves 55% of it goes to the power generation sector while 27% goes to factories and industry, 10% to household purposes and 5% in the automotive sector. Furthermore, the government has a targeted six, 5-year plans from 2010 to 2021 where it would try to produce 8,500 MW in 2013, 11,500 MW in 2015 and 20,000 MW by 2021. It is a part of the ‘Digital Bangladesh’ scheme’s Vision 21 where the government would seek universal electrification around the nation. The plan also targets an increase in domestic and important coal based power plants, and more on-shore or off-shore gas exploration. Ruppur Nuclear Power Plant Implementation Project (RNNP) is also one such scheme to reach an addition capacity of 9000 MW.
Currently, around 88% of energy used for power generation is from natural gas sources and 4% from coal, 6% from oil and just 2% from Hydro-based power plants in Chittagong. Renewable Energy sources are totally excluded from any contributions. By 2021, the target plans to reduce gas imports to 30%, while raising coal contributions to 53%. This will have disastrous effects. Finally by 2030, renewable energy contributions would by increased to a mere 6%, while nuclear power was increased to around 30%.
Waste disposal.
There are obvious arguments in favor of nuclear energy when compared to the use of coal. For example, a single 1000 MW coal-fired plant produces over 300,000 tons of ash, 44,000 tons of sulphur dioxide, 22,000 tons of Nitrous Oxide and 6 million tons of carbon. In contrast, a 1000 MW of nuclear power plant produces a mere 3 cubic meters of wastes after reprocessing the spent fuel, 300 tons of radioactive wastes and 0.20 tons of plutonium. However, a unit ton of nuclear waste is far more dangerous than the same amount of coal-fired plant waste, if not managed properly. At the same time, dealing with nuclear wastes is more expensive.
Costs.
There are also different transport requirements for both nuclear fuel and fossil fuels in the context of Bangladesh. Transportation costs are higher for coal and oil systems at 20000 train cars or 10 super tankers, in relation to a nuclear plant at just 3-4 trucks. Around the world, there is projected to be around 860 nuclear power plants generating over 800,000 MW.
Disaster management.
According to the 4th IPCC, climate change in the region of the project area could cause exacerbate significant river erosion, deposition and flooding which would be of concern. River erosion is a significant hazard along all of Bangladesh's rivers which destroys land and critical infrastructure continually, rendering thousands homeless and displaced every year. The site area immediately downstream from the Indian border is in addition vulnerable to unilateral bank protection construction.

Green Belt of Vitoria-Gasteiz

The Green Belt of Vitoria-Gasteiz is the result of an ambitious plan of restoration and reclamation on the outskirts of the city that seeks to recover the ecological and social value of this space through the creation of a nature tour around the city articulated by various enclaves of high ecological value and landscape.
History.
The idea of the Green Belt comes in the early 1990s in order to provide a comprehensive solution to the problems of the urban periphery of Vitoria-Gasteiz and the general state of disrepair that the area presented. 
When the project began, on the outskirts of the city coexisted with high ecological value areas such as forests or Zabalgana Armentia that, although affected by problems of erosion, fire ... had managed to survive the urban and industrial expansion of the city, with gravel pits, dumps and other degraded sites that threatened the fragile survival of relict existing natural enclaves. The area offered a precarious and insecure to stay and ride, having become a physical and social barrier between the urban and rural adjacent.
To address existing problems and convert and / or enhance the value, if any, the suburbs, and residual clearly undervalued, Environmental Studies Center of the City of Vitoria-Gasteiz decided to undertake a large-scale project that encompasses all the periphery of the city and provide a solution to both areas operated as natural enclaves.
It was basically to create a network of suburban green spaces, an idea also found support and rationale within the management framework established by the General Urban Plan of 1986 that it proposed extending the system of urban green areas to areas peripherals.
Parks.
Alegria.
Situated between the river Zadorra and wetlands of Salburua, the river Alegría and its banks represent today an important ecological corridor between these two valuable ecosystems, allowing the movement of such representative species as the European mink. It is a space for leisure activities, which connects the periurban Salburua park with the future fluvial park of the river Zadorra, in the Gamarra area.
Armentia.
This is a large natural forest oak, located between the city and the Mountains of Vitoria, the main mountain range and one of the most valuable natural areas in the municipality of Vitoria-Gasteiz. Precisely its location makes the Forest of Armentia a real biological corridor between the forest areas, green areas and peri-urban ecosystem, and in this paper lies the main value Armentia Park.
Errekaleor.
The future park is bounded on the south Olarizu Park and north to wetlands Salburua, being included within the new residential expansion Salburua. Its location makes this place an important connecting element between the Green Belt parks located south and east of the city. The river Errekaleor ensure ecological connectivity while the Cerro de Las Refrigerators, noteworthy from the standpoint of landscape, will be included in the Green Belt as a promenade a must for great views.
Olárizu.
The fields open stands of Olárizu, an iconic mountain and the many trails that run through there and connects the city with the nearby towns, make this park a popular spot that is ideal for walking or just stay in the many corners enabled ello.A Unlike the other parks in the Green Belt, Olarizu Park has a "less natural" and closer to the typically urban park concept, as it is with this character as originally conceived. Created in 1984 to the mid-90 becomes part of the Green Belt. Since then, his conditioning has been directed mainly to public use and to accept training and environmental education.
Salburua.
Is a wetland formed by several lakes (Arcaute and Betoño are the main ones), along with spaces and a small oak empradizados. The lakes dried centuries ago to transform the area into farmland, the restoration work started in 1994 have reversed this situation and now Salburua is one of the most valuable inland wetlands of the Basque Country and Ramsar Wetland of International Importance.
Maintenance.
There is a permanent maintenance service in the Green Belt that monitors the state of conservation of the plants in the Parks including the mowing of grass and treed meadows, irrigation, digging, fertilising, hoeing, pruning, replacing dead plants, sowing and planting, as well as other related tasks.
There is also a service responsible for maintaining the equipment and signposting in the Green Belt. Its work includes ensuring that these are kept in the best possible state of conservation, as well as the repair, refitting and replacement of damaged equipment due to normal wear and tear or due to accidents or vandalism.
The overall maintenance of the Belt includes a general cleaning service that comprises the clearing of riverbanks after periods of flooding, the removal of rubbish and graffiti from signposts and equipment and other tasks.

Andrew A. Skolnick

Andrew A. Skolnick is an American science and medical journalist and photographer best known for his 
investigative reporting on health care issues, alternative medicine, and paranormal claims.
Education and career.
In 1972, Skolnick participated in a two-year professional photography certificate program at the Paier College of Art, then received a B.A. from Charter Oak State College in 1978 and an M.S. from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 1981.
At Yale University, Skolnick was a scientific photographer in the biology department from 1975 to 1977, and a visiting lecturer teaching scientific photography from 1976 to 1977. His journalism experience began as a science writer for the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation from 1981 to 1985, after which he served as the life sciences editor at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign News Bureau from 1985 to 1987, the associate science news editor at the American Medical Association (AMA) from 1987 until 1989, and an associate news editor at the "Journal of the American Medical Association" ("JAMA").
From 2004 to 2006, Skolnick served as the executive director of the Center for Inquiry's Commission on Scientific Medicine and Mental Health.
In 1996, he was invited to China for a semester to teach western journalism at Shanghai International Studies University, where he also served as language adviser and script editor for Shanghai Television International Broadcasting Service.
In 1998, the Carter Center Mental Health Program awarded Skolnick with an inaugural Rosalynn Carter Fellowship for Mental Health Journalism to investigate the treatment of jail and prison inmates with mental illness, an investigation which led to the publication of two news reports in "JAMA" and to a special series in the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" titled "Death, Neglect and the Bottom Line".
Skolnick's reporting has received awards from health, media, and humanitarian organizations, including World Hunger Year, the National Association of Community Health Centers, the Carter Center Mental Health Program, and the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. Skolnick, Bell and Allen also received Amnesty International USA's "Spotlight on Media Award" and, in 1999, were listed by Harvard University's Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy as finalists for the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting. The following year, the American Medical Writers Association awarded Skolnick the 2000 John P. McGovern Medal for Preeminence in Medical Communication.
For the "Skeptical Inquirer" series "Testing the Girl with the X-Ray Eyes" authors Ray Hyman, Joe Nickell, and Skolnick were co-recipients of CSI's 2005 Robert P. Balles Prize in Critical Thinking. Skolnick's award was for the article "Natasha Demkina: The Girl with the Normal Eyes".
Since his retirement from journalism in 2006 Skolnick has focused on photography of dogs, and provides photography and web site design for dog clubs and breeders.
Controversies.
TM lawsuit.
In 1992, Skolnick, "JAMA"'s editor George Lundberg, and the AMA were sued for $194 million by Deepak Chopra and two Transcendental Meditation (TM) organizations over Skolnick's article titled, "Maharishi Ayur-Veda: Guru's Marketing Scheme Promises the World Eternal 'Perfect Health.'" The suit alleged Skolnick's report on TM's health care products and services marketed under the trademarked name Maharishi Ayurveda was libelous and that it tortiously interfered with their business interests.
In an August 1992 decision, judge Charles Kocoras rejected the plaintiff’s motion to enjoin "JAMA" and Skolnick from publishing statements about Chopra and Hari Sharma and Maharishi Ayurveda alleged to be defamatory, noting that the plaintiffs did not allege that the statements about them in the article were false or misleading. The decision held that "plaintiffs have little likelihood of prevailing on the merits of their disparagement claim", and that the allegedly defamatory statements were protected as "fair comment and criticism" on an issue of public concern. Shortly thereafter, the case was dismissed without prejudice in March 1993.
CMS lawsuit.
The AMA dismissed Skolnick when Correctional Medical Services, one of the for-profit health care companies criticized in the "Death, Neglect and the Bottom Line" article, threatened "JAMA" and the "Post-Dispatch" with litigation. 
Skolnick also sued CMS, claiming their responses to the articles were defamatory, but a summary judgement ruled in favor of CMS, the defendants.

Nuclear energy in Jordan

Jordan has signed memorandums of understanding with the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Japan, China, Russia, Spain, South Korea, Argentina, Romania, and Turkey. In December 2009, Jordan Atomic Energy Commission (JAEC) in cooperation with a consortium headed by the Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute signed an agreement with Daewoo Heavy Industries to build a its first 5 MW research reactor by 2014 at the Jordan University of Science and Technology.
The research reactor will become a focal point for a Nuclear Technology Centre, which will train upcoming generations of nuclear engineers and scientists in the Kingdom in addition to provide irradiation services for the industrial, agricultural and medical sectors.
Nuclear power plans.
In 2007, Jordan's Committee for Nuclear Strategy was formed in order to start the development of nuclear programs in Jordan. Their ultimate goal is to provide 30% of their own electricity by 2030, and to prove for exports. In April 2012 the Jordan Atomic Energy Commission shortened the list from seven to two possible reactor vendors. The two vendors have been narrowed down to Areva-Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Russia's AtomStroyExport. The research reactor will become a focal point for a Nuclear Technology Centre, which will train upcoming generations of nuclear engineers and scientists in the Kingdom in addition to provide irradiation services for the industrial, agricultural and medical sectors. In March 2013, Jordan received approval to begin construction on the Research and Training Reactor at the Jordan University of Science and Technology. The approximate cost of the reactor is $130 million, with at least $70 million being loaned by the South Korean government.
Jordan plans to build at least one reactor by 2019. The government first chose a site 25 kilometers south of the Red Sea port of Aqaba but shifted the tentative location to the Mafraq area, 40 kilometers northeast of Amman, citing the proximity to the Khirbet Al Samra power plant for using its wastewater to cool the reactor. The decision to relocate the site was taken by the Belgian contractor, Tractebel, which has concluded that the seismic padding required to build on the original site near Aqaba would have led to additional costs of about 15 percent according to JAEC officials.
According to Khaled Toukan, chairman of the Jordan Atomic Energy Commission, in April Jordan will choose the consortium to build two 1-gigawatt (GW) reactors, at an estimated cost of 12 billion euros (about US$16 billion).
It will be used for electricity generation and desalination. The studies are carried out by Tractebel Engineering.
In October 2013 the Russian VVER-1000 design was selected in a competitive tender for Jordan's first twin reactor nuclear power station.
Jordan has also granted Areva exclusive mining rights for uranium in central Jordan.
International relations.
Since Jordan is new to the nuclear world, they will be forced to rely on foreign allies. In order to become a nuclear nation, Jordan has had to sign numerous agreements and create new relations with countries throughout the world. Jordan has signed memorandums of understanding with the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Japan, China, Russia, Spain, South Korea, Argentina, Romania, and Turkey. In December 2009, Jordan Atomic Energy Commission (JAEC) in cooperation with a consortium headed by the Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute signed an agreement with Daewoo Heavy Industries to build a its first research reactor by 2014 at the Jordan University of Science and Technology.
Jordan has also signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which promotes peaceful uses of nuclear energy. As recent as April, 2014 King Abdullah II met with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a possible Jordanian-Russian nuclear cooperation.
Environmental concerns.
Anti-nuclear campaigns.
As the Jordanian government moves closer to the development of nuclear power plants, the anti-nuclear movement has picked up. The movement is spearheaded by Basel Burgan, an environmentalist and activist who leads the National Campaign, which strives to protect the people of Jordan from the dangers of nuclear energy. Burgan is one of the largest advocates for a nuclear free Jordan. The National Campaign stresses the idea that the nuclear power plants would contaminate Jordan's scarce water supply. Greenpeace Jordan has also made numerous contributions to the movement against nuclear energy in Jordan. Greenpeace Jordan has encouraged the Jordanian government to entertain the idea of creating an energy policy based on renewable resources. The report brings to light some of the major issues that would occur from Jordan becoming a nuclear energy using nation and proposes a way for Jordan to thrive as a nuclear free nation. The deprivation of water in Jordan combined with heavy seismic activity. A possible site would be placed above the Azraq Aquifer, which provides one of the largest sources of freshwater to Amman. Jordan is already facing a high paced depletion of water resources, calling into question if the country can actually afford to take the risk of building these power plants. Jordan's Federation for Environmental Societies has used Jordan's lack of water resources as a platform for their anti-nuclear views. The lack of water has also contributed to concerns about the cooling of the reactors. In cooling the reactors, Jordan would need to use approximately 500 cubic meters of water annually. Many proponents against nuclear energy in Jordan cite water resource issues at the forefront of their protests; many believe that Jordan does not have room for water to spare.

Nuclear energy in Vietnam

Vietnam has been considering to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes based on modern, verified technology since 1995, and firm proposals surfaced in 2006. However in January 2014 it was reported that Vietnam had decided to delay construction by six years.
The race to diversify beyond its primarily Hydro and Coal energy mix, is driven largely by the country's growing energy demand, which is expected to increase annually by 16%, i.e. from 16 GW "(2010)" to 30 GW "(2015)". Another factor is the challenges it faces in identifying new suitable hydro power project sites.
Its first ever nuclear power projects will be implemented in two major sites in Ninh Thuận Province. The 4 X 1000 MW Ninh Thuận 1 site at Phuoc Dinh, will be built in collaboration with Russian State company - Atomstroyexport, and will set the stage for the foundation of Vietnam's first ever nuclear power plant unit "(estimated completion - 2020)". The Japanese consortium - JINED will construct the second site - 4 X 1000 MW Ninh Thuận 2 at Ninh Hải district.
In March 2012, an intergovernmental pact was signed between Vietnam and South Korea, to start a one-year feasibility study for the construction of four Korean-developed APR 1400 nuclear reactors, additional to the NPP's signed with Russia and Japan. It practically clinched the South Korean consortium as the preferred bidder; however, an official deal will only be signed after approval from the Vietnamese parliament.
The 1 GW reactor unit no. 1 at Ninh Thuận 1, will be commissioned and connected to the national grid by 2020, which at that time will represent 1.5% of the projected total output of 52 GW. In June 2010, Vietnam announced that it plans to build 14 nuclear reactors at eight sites in five provinces by 2030, to satisfy at least 15 GW nuclear power "(i.e. 10% share)" of the estimated total demand of 112 GW. An ambitious strategy to increase the nuclear share to 20-25% by 2050 has also been outlined.
The nuclear power plant sites in Vietnam will all be operated by the state electricity utility company - EVN.
History.
1958 till 1975.
Vietnam's aspiration to harness nuclear energy for electricity generation and uses in areas such as medicine and agriculture, dates back to 1958, when Vietnam - one of the first nations under the Atoms for Peace program, orders a small research reactor, the General Atomics-built TRIGA-Mark II.
In 1963, the Dalat Nuclear Research Institute, which houses Vietnam's nuclear research reactor, began operating with US assistance. The Second Indochina War interrupted Vietnam's development plans and during that war, the United States dismantled the U.S.-supplied Triga reactor.
1975 till 2006.
Immediately after the war, the reunified nation began to rebuild its infrastructure and governmental agencies, establishing the Vietnam Atomic Energy Commission (VAEC) "(now the Vietnam Atomic Energy Institute, VAEI)" in 1976, under the management of the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST).
The VAEC was tasked with pursuing a national programme for application of Nuclear Energy to Socio-Economy Sectors of Vietnam. In 1980, the 500 Kw Dalat research reactor, under the management of the VAEC was restored with Soviet help and upgraded under the IAEA support.
In the early 1980s, two preliminary nuclear power studies were undertaken, followed by another which stated in 1995 that: "Around the year 2015, when electricity demand reaches more than 100 billion kWh, nuclear power should be introduced for satisfying the continuous growth in the country's electricity demand in that time and beyond".
The race to diversify beyond its primarily Hydro and Coal energy mix intensified, when the country's energy demand projections were estimated to increase annually by 16% from 16 GW "(2010)" to 30 GW "(2015)". The challenges it faced in identifying new suitable hydro power project sites and inefficient running of the current Hydropower facilities due to unfavorable weather conditions, furthered its cause to harness nuclear energy for power generation.
2006 till present.
In 2006, firm proposals surfaced and the Vietnamese government announced that a 2000 MWe nuclear power plant should be on line by 2020. This general target was confirmed in a nuclear power development plan approved by the government in August 2007, with the target being raised to a total of 8000 MWe nuclear by 2025. A general law on nuclear energy was passed in mid 2008, and plans for developing a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework envisaged.
In October 2008, two major locations in Ninh Thuận Province, namely Phuoc Dinh and Vinh Hai, were confirmed by the Vietnamese government as the sites to implement its first ever nuclear power projects, with 2 X 1000 MW reactors units on each site, totaling nearly 4 GW of power output
In June 2010, Vietnam announced that it plans to build 14 nuclear reactors at eight sites in five provinces by 2030, to satisfy at least 15 GW nuclear power "(i.e. 10% share)" of the estimated total demand of 112 GW. Four more units were added to the first two sites in Ninh Thuận, then six more at six sites, namely Binh Tien (Ninh Thuận Province), Xuan Phuong (Phú Yên Province), Hoai My (Bình Định Province), Duc Thang (Quảng Ngãi Province), Duc Chanh (Quảng Ngãi Province), and Ky Xuan (Hà Tĩnh Province).
In October 2010, Vietnam signed an inter-governmental agreement with Russia for the construction of the country's first nuclear power plant - Ninh Thuận 1 at Phuoc Dinh, using two VVER-1000 or 1200 reactors (increased later by two more units). The 4 X 1000 MW Ninh Thuận 1 site, will be built by Atomstroyexport, a subsidiary of Rosatom. The construction is due to start by 2014 and the first unit to be commissioned and connected to the national grid by 2020. Russia's Ministry of Finance will finance Vietnam, at least 85% of the first plant and in November 2011, an agreement for a $8 billion loan was signed with the Russian government's state export credit bureau. An intergovernmental agreement was also signed to establish a nuclear science and technology center in Vietnam.
On the same day in October 2010, an intergovernmental agreement with Japan was signed for construction of a second nuclear power plant -- Ninh Thuận 2 at Vinh Hai in Ninh Thuận Province, with its two reactors to come on line in 2024-25. The Japanese consortium - International Nuclear Energy Development of Japan Co. Ltd. (JINED) will construct the 4 X 1000 MW Ninh Thuận 2 site. The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), confirmed the financing and insurance of up to 85% of the total cost.
Aside from the currently involved Atomstroyexport (Russia) and JINED ( Japan), Westinghouse (Japan/US), GE (US), EDF (France), KEPCO (South Korea), and CGNPC (China), have all expressed strong interest in constructing the future nuclear power projects outlined, as part of an ambitious strategy to increase the nuclear share to 20-25% by 2050.
In March 2012, it was announced that South Korea and Vietnam will start a one-year feasibility study for the construction of four Korean-developed APR 1400 nuclear reactors, additional to the NPP's signed with Russia and Japan. The intergovernmental pact signed between Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung and South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, practically clinched the South Korean consortium as the preferred bidder. However, an official deal will only be signed after approval from the Vietnamese parliament.
Vietnam is planning to send 2,000 workers and engineers to the Russian Federation and Japan for 2–3 years training in nuclear power construction, starting 2013 end.
However in January 2014 it was reported that Vietnam had decided to delay construction by six years, to permit improved safety and efficiency in the plants.

Jim Brady (baseball)

James Joseph Brady, Jr., (born March 2, 1936) is an American economist, retired university educator and administrator, and a former left-handed pitcher in professional baseball. He attended and earned three degrees from the University of Notre Dame.
Brady served as the sixth president of Jacksonville University from 1989 through 1996 after service as dean of both the university's College of Arts and Sciences and Davis College of Business. Prior to that, he held the department chair in economics at Old Dominion University and was a member of the economics faculty of his alma mater, Notre Dame.
As a baseball player, the , Brady was signed off his college campus as an undergraduate by the Detroit Tigers as a $37,500 "bonus baby" in 1955. Detroit's farm system director, John McHale, was a Notre Dame alumnus and Brady promised his father he would return to college to complete his education when he signed his contract. Under the terms of the bonus rule then in effect, however, Brady was forced to spend the first two years of his pro career on a Major League roster.
Nicknamed "Diamond Jim" because of his bonus status, Brady missed the 1955 season due to an injury, then made his MLB debut on May 12, 1956, hurling a perfect ninth inning against the Chicago White Sox in a 7–6 loss at Briggs Stadium. A week later, he pitched another scoreless inning against the Baltimore Orioles, but was treated roughly in his next four appearances, surrendering 20 earned runs on 15 hits and ten bases on balls in only 4 innings of work.
He made only those six appearances, all in relief, during the season, then was sent to the minors for good in 1957. He retired as an active player after appearing in eight games for the 1961 Knoxville Smokies of the Class A Sally League.
According to Jacksonville University, as of 2011, Brady was an arbitrator in North Florida.

List of bids for the Winter Olympics

The Winter Olympics are a multi-sport event in winter sports organized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) every four years. Selection of the host city is done at an IOC Session four to seven years prior to the tournament, in which the IOC members vote between candidate cities which have submitted bids. As of the selection of the 2018 Olympics, 23 games have been held in 20 cities in 11 countries. Bids have been made by 56 cities in 23 countries.
The bid process consists of two rounds. First, cities and national Olympic committees (NOCs) may show their interest and submit a preliminary bid, becoming applicant cities. Through analysis of the questionnaires, the IOC gave a weighted-average score to each city based on the scores obtained in each of the questionnaire's eleven themes: political and social support, general infrastructure, sports venues, Olympic Village, environment, accommodation, transport, security, past experience, finance, and legacy. IOC's Executive Committee then selects a short-list of candidate cities. The candidate cities are investigated by the IOC Evaluation Committee, who make an evaluation report. These submit a more extensive bid book and are subject to additional evaluation, which is presented to the IOC members. Voting occurs as an exhaustive ballot, which may occur through multiple rounds until a single city holds a majority of the votes. IOC members from a candidate NOC may not vote in any round while their country remains in the election.
The first games were not subject to bids and awarded to Chamonix as part of Paris' bid for the 1924 Summer Olympics. Originally the host country of the Summer Olympics had the right to host the Winter Olympics as well, if they could provide a suitable host. The 1940 Olympics were originally awarded to Sapporo, but it and the 1944 Winter Olympics were ultimately canceled due to the Second World War. The 1976 Olympics were awarded to Denver, but in a 1972 referendum, voters rejected the games, and for the only time a city awarded the Games rejected them. IOC then offered them to Whistler, but a change of government meant they were no longer interested. Salt Lake City offered to host the games, but IOC finally chose Innsbruck instead. From 1994, Winter Olympics were held between Summer Olympic years.Starting with the 2004 Olympics, only the highest-rated cities are short-listed for the final IOC vote.
Innsbruck, Lake Placid and St. Moritz are the only cities to have hosted two games. Albertville, Grenoble, Nagano and Turin have never lost a bid. With six, Lake Placid has the most bids, followed by Cortina d'Ampezzo with five. Montreal and Jaca have both made four bids without any being successful. Helsinki, Minneapolis, Montreal and Munich have bid for both Summer and Winter Olympics; all but Minneapolis have succeeded at winning Summer bids, but none have held Winter Olympics. Both Canada and the United States have bid twelve times, with the US being awarded five (including Denver) and Canada two games. Other counties to hold multiple games are three in France and two each in Austria, Italy, Japan, Norway and Switzerland. Of unsuccessful countries, Sweden has six consecutive and Finland five bids.
By year.
The following is a list of bids for the Winter Olympics, sorted by year. It consists of the year the games were held or scheduled to be held, the date the decision was made, the city and country which issued the bid, the votes at the IOC Session for each voting round, and the ultimate host of the games. The bid listed first for each games is the one selected by the IOC, whether or not it ultimately hosted the games.

Peter Ulrich

Peter Ulrich (born 29 August 1958 in Perivale, England) is a multi-instrumentalist songwriter and recording artist.
Biography.
He was educated at Vaughan School in West Harrow, Cannon Lane School in Pinner, the John Lyon School in Harrow, and Hatfield Polytechnic, from which he graduated in humanities.
A self-taught drummer, he began playing in blues-soul band Mischief on the East London pub and club circuit in the early 1980s.
In 1982 he met Brendan Perry and Lisa Gerrard in London and joined Dead Can Dance on drums and percussion and, in 1983, was one of the members of DCD to sign with the 4AD label.
He played on DCD's eponymous first album, the "Garden of the Arcane Delights" EP, the albums "Within the Realm of a Dying Sun" and "Spiritchaser", and the promo single "Sambatiki", and on both sessions recorded for the BBC Radio 1 John Peel Show, as well as playing virtually all live dates with DCD from 1983 to 1990.
During the 1980s Ulrich also contributed a percussion piece called "At First, and Then" to the This Mortal Coil album "Filigree & Shadow", and made cameo appearances on albums by Wolfgang Press and Pieter Nooten & Michael Brook.
In 1990 he released his first solo recording - a double A-sided 12" vinyl single featuring his songs "Taqaharu's Leaving" and "Evocation" which has since become a rare collector's item.
His first solo album - "Pathways and Dawns" - which was largely arranged, recorded and produced by Brendan Perry at DCD's studio in Ireland, was released on the Projekt label in 1999 and was dubbed the album the Beatles might have made had the group signed with 4AD instead of Capitol by "Alternative Press".
His second solo album, "Enter The Mysterium", was released in 2005 on City Canyons Records (licensed by Music and Words in Europe).
The song "The Scryer and the Shewstone" from the album was featured on "John Barleycorn Reborn", a highly acclaimed album of dark British folk music released on Cold Spring Records in 2007.
In 2009 Ulrich made a guest appearance, together with Brendan Perry, on the Piano Magic album "Ovations" playing percussion and hammered dulcimer.
In his current project - The Peter Ulrich Collaboration - he has worked closely with City Canyons CEO Trebor Lloyd and a wide ranging group of artists including Sara Wendt, David Steele, Jen Elliott, Kingsley Sage of Anemo and Saskia Dommisse of Poets to their Beloved. The first fruit of this collaboration is an album The Painted Caravan released on Market Square Records in March 2013 which has attracted positive reviews in national UK publications as diverse as Rock'n'Reel magazine and the Financial Times, as well as receiving radio airplay from Tom Robinson and Frank Skinner. The Ulrich Collaboration is set to continue, with work currently underway on a follow-up album.
Ulrich continues to be heavily influenced by folk, world and early musics, and draws many elements of these into his distinctive style of songwriting and arranging.

Aberlemnia

Aberlemnia is a genus of extinct vascular plants of the Early Devonian (around ), which consisted of leafless stems with terminal spore-forming organs (sporangia). Fossils found in Scotland were initially described as "Cooksonia caledonica". A later review, which included new and more complete fossils from Brazil, showed that the specimens did not fit the circumscription of the genus "Cooksonia"; accordingly a new genus "Aberlemnia" was proposed.
Description.
Fossils from which the genus was first described were found in the Aberlemno quarry, Scotland. Other fossils now assigned to "Aberlemnia caledonica" have been found in Wales, Brazil and possibly Bolivia. Plants consisted of smooth leafless stems (axes) up to 1.4 mm wide, decreasing in width at each branching. Specimens branched up to five times, at angles between 25 and 55°, mainly dichotomously, although those from Brazil had some trichotomies. Spore-forming organs or sporangia were borne at the ends of the stems. Individual sporangia varied in shape. Smaller ones were more or less circular in outline, larger ones were kidney-shaped (reniform), up to 2 mm high and 3 mm wide. The difference in shape is interpreted as being due to growth and maturation. To release their spores, the sporangia split into two valves along the border opposite to the stem on which they were attached (i.e. distally).
Taxonomy.
Specimens were first attributed to "Cooksonia caledonica" by Edwards in 1970. According to a review of the genus "Cooksonia" by Gonez and Gerrienne, the sporangium of the type species ("C. pertoni") is formed by a widening of the end of a stem. At maturity the sporangium is topped by a flattish disk (an operculum) and releases its spores when this breaks up. The sporangia of "C. caledonica" are quite different. No existing genus was considered to cover the precise morphology of this plant, so that a new genus "Aberlemnia" was put forward. The name is based on the location where the first fossils were found, Aberlemno in Scotland.
Phylogeny.
Gonez and Gerrienne consider that "Cooksonia" is the most basal of the stem group of the lycophytes, whereas their genus "Aberlemnia" diverged later and is more derived. Consistent with this position, the genus has a combination of inherited features or plesiomorphies, such as dichotomous branching and terminal sporangia, with more advanced features, such as bivalved sporangia, which are characteristic of the lycophytes. A cladistic study in which they included the two best-characterized species of "Cooksonia", "C. paranensis" and "C. pertonii", together with "Aberlemnia caledonica" (then still called "C. caledonica") produced the following cladogram:

Edmund Bowyer (died 1627)

Sir Edmund Bowyer (12 May 1552 – 18 February 1627) was an English lawyer, landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1593 and 1624.
Bowyer was the eldest son of John Bowyer of Camberwell and his second wife, Elizabeth Draper, daughter of Robert Draper, gentleman, of Camberwell, Surrey, Page of the Jewels to King Henry VIII. He was admitted at Lincoln's Inn in 1569 and succeeded to the estates of his father in about 1570. He was called to the bar in 1577. From 1582 he was J.P. for Surrey and in 1583, Bowyer added to his Surreyestate by buying one-fifth of the manor of Camberwell Buckingham.
In 1593, Bowyer was elected Member of Parliament for Morpeth. He was elected MP for Southwark in 1597. From 1600 to 1601 he was High Sheriff of Surrey and Sussex. He was knighted in 1603. In 1604 he was elected MP for Surrey. He was Deputy Lieutenant of Surrey by 1614 when he was re-elected MP for Surrey. He was one of the governors of the free grammar school at Camberwell, which was founded under letters patent granted in September 1615. In September 1616 he attended the consecration of Dulwich College after selling land to the founder. In 1624 he was elected MP for Gatton.
Bowyer died at the age of 74.
Bowyer married Katherine Bynd, daughter of William Bynd of Washington, Sussex in 1573. Bowyer left his estates in Camberwell to his nephew Edmund who was later MP for Gatton.

Also, Blazer served as Commissioner of the American Soccer League and Executive Vice President of the United States Soccer Federation. He was the General Secretary of CONCACAF until 2012.
In May of 2011, in response to allegations of bribery made by national representatives attending a 10 May meeting of the Caribbean Football Union (CFU), Blazer initiated an investigation of AFC President Mohammed bin Hammam and FIFA Vice President Jack Warner. The investigation was conducted by John P.Collins, former United States federal prosecutor and FIFA Legal Committee member. Its submission led to FIFA's 29 May 2011 suspension of Warner and Bin Hammam from all soccer activities pending the outcome of FIFA's own investigation and procedures. Acting CONCACAF president Lisle Austin attempted to fire Blazer five days later, but the action was blocked by the CONCACAF executive committee. On 15 June 2011, Blazer was questioned by FIFA's ethics committee.
On 14 August 2011, journalist Andrew Jennings noted in British newspaper "The Independent" that the FBI was examining documentary evidence revealing confidential football payments to offshore accounts operated by Chuck Blazer.
On 19 April 2013 Blazer and Jack Warner were accused of massive fraud during their years as CONCACAF executives. A forensic audit by the organization's Integrity Committee determined that both men had functioned without a written contract from 1998 until their respective departures, and that Blazer had received 15 million dollars in commissions for his services during that time frame. An anonymous government source expects that an ongoing FBI investigation into Blazer's finances will be expanded significantly and joined by the IRS. 
In May 2013, Blazer was suspended for 90 days.

Dreaming (M People song)

"Dreaming" is the nineteenth and final single from British band M People. It is the second single from their greatest hits album The Best of M People (1998). Written by Mike Pickering, Paul Heard and Heather Small. Produced by M People and Chris Lord-Alge. It was released on 1 February 1999. The song peaked at number thirteen on the UK Singles Chart.
Background.
Following the success of the The Best of M People Tour in Autumn 1998 and the number 2 peak of the album selling over a million copies in three months, the band marked its success with another single, reflecting how to fulfil dream and realise the difference between dreams and reality. 
The Band took a short break together over the 1998 New Year, before returning to promote the last single to be released from the album: Dreaming. They had achieved ten UK Top 10 hits and Testify had charted at number 12. The band planned to re-edit the song from the album version to give it softer feel, enlisting the help of Chris Lord-Alge who had also re-edited the Fresco (album) single Angel St.
Chart performance.
When released Dreaming sold in excess of 42,000 copies in its first week to enter the chart and peak at number 13, one place below previous single, Testify. It promptly left the chart falling to number 38, dropping 25 places which is the biggest drop of any M People single week-on-week and its downward trajectory continued moving to No. 58 and then finally No. 71. 
Formats and Mixes.
The single was available on two CD formats. CD1 contains the Radio Edit, plus their unique live cover of the Gladys Knight and the Pips 1977 hit "Baby Don't Change Your Mind" recorded at the Jools Holland Special show in February 1998 and also there is an exclusive megamix of M People's biggest singles into a ten-minute montage.
CD2 contains the remixes of David Morales and Jimmy Gomez who rendered their services on the 103.5 Radio Edit and the Vocal Mix, respectively. They also issued more remixes which were used on limited edition7" and 12" vinyl promo's issued to DJs.
Music video.
The music video was filmed on 14 November 1998, before rehearsals for their The Best of M People Tour that winter, featuring all four members of the band. 
The opening shot is of Heather, standing motionless, holding a cup and wearing a black dress, looking out of an apartment window overlooking Paddington station and she seems to be daydreaming as she then picks up her keys and coat, leaves the flat and goes for a walk. When starting her walk she passes band members, Mike, Paul and Shovel who are sat outside a restaurant. She sees them but they don't notice her. Her long walk continues with flashbacks of people kissing and children playing and this is followed by Heather walking and various locations that are super-imposed behind her, including London's Camden Lock Bridge and pathway, a basement club with people dancing, Docklands, Canada Water and the streets of the City of London. Mike, Paul and Shovel feature occasionally and are seen together throwing paper planes and walking, their scenes are reversed and re-played repeatedly.
By the second chorus, night has fallen and Heather is superimposed walking along London's Old Compton Street, Piccadilly and China Town amongst the bustling nightlife before the middle-eight where is she sings and gestures towards various London Landmark locations that share the screen with her, including Tower Bridge, The River Thames, St Pauls Cathedral and the HSBC Tower, London.
In the final bridge, Heather's image is superimposed on shimmery water and the shots quicken in pace and irregularity as the song progresses; fast forwarding and rewinding and changing from colour to black and white with unsteady movements. The video ends in the same way it began with Heather day dreaming out of the window overlooking Paddington Station in the sunlight, motionless.
Artwork.
The artwork of the CD single is another photo derived from The Best of M People photo shoot that features Heather in the forefront of the picture smiling in a white vest top and black trousers, while the Shovel, Mike and Paul are chatting to each other behind her. CD1 has a brown border (see banner above CD2 has a sky blue border. The CD promo cover is a blurred picture of the band pictured together from the same shoot but in a line facing ht camera in medium/close-up shot.

Ted (film)

Ted (stylized as ted) is a 2012 American comedy film directed by Seth MacFarlane. The screenplay by MacFarlane, Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild is from MacFarlane's story. The film stars Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis, and MacFarlane, with Joel McHale and Giovanni Ribisi in supporting roles. The film tells the story of John Bennett, a Boston native whose childhood wish brings his teddy bear friend Ted to life, but Ted keeps John and his love interest Lori Collins from moving on with their lives.
The film is MacFarlane's feature-length directorial debut, produced by Media Rights Capital and distributed by Universal Pictures. It was released on June 29, 2012, and received generally positive reviews and was a commercial success, becoming the twelfth highest-grossing film of 2012, the highest-grossing R-rated film of the year, and the highest-grossing original R-rated comedy of all time. The film also received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song.
A sequel has been announced to be released on June 26, 2015 by Universal Studios. 
Plot.
In 1985, John Bennett is a lonely child who dearly wished for his new Christmas gift, a large teddy bear named Ted, to come to life to be his friend. That wish coincided with a falling star and Ted became a fully mobile sentient being. John's parents got over the shock, word of the miracle spread and Ted was briefly a celebrity.
In 2012, John and Ted are still staunch, if immature, companions enjoying a hedonistic life even while John is in a relationship with office worker Lori Collins. As their fourth anniversary approaches, Lori hopes to marry John, but feels he can't move ahead with his life with Ted around. John is resistant to making his lifelong companion leave, but is finally persuaded to act when the couple discover Ted at home with four prostitutes, one of whom had defecated on the floor during a game of truth or dare.
John finds Ted his own apartment and a job at a grocery store, where his grossly irresponsible behavior gets him promoted and acquainted with co-worker Tami-Lynn. Regardless, Ted and John still spend most of their time together, which frustrates Lori when she discovers John has been skipping work to do so while using her for his excuses. Things start to come to a head when Lori and John are invited to a party put on by Lori's lecherous manager Rex, and Ted lures John away to a party at his apartment with the offer to meet Sam Jones, the star of their favorite movie, "Flash Gordon". Although John arrives with the intention of spending only a few minutes, he gets caught up in the occasion which goes completely out of control. Lori discovers John there and breaks up with him in a rage. At that point, John blames Ted for ruining his life and tells him to stay away.
Eventually, Ted and John confront each other about their ruined friendship and manage to reconcile after a destructive brawl in John's hotel room. To repair John's relationship with Lori, Ted arranges with an old lover, singer Norah Jones, to help by having John express his love for Lori with a song during her concert. Although John's performance proves an embarrassment, Lori is touched by the attempt and returns to her apartment after being disgusted by Rex's sneering of him. Ted comes clean to Lori about his role in John's lapse and offers to leave them alone forever if she can talk to him. Lori is persuaded, but moments after she leaves, Ted is kidnapped by Donny, a crazed stalker who idolized Ted as a child. Donny plans to make Ted the toy of his brutishly destructive son, Robert.
Ted distracts Robert and reach a phone to contact John, but is soon recaptured. Realizing that Ted is in danger, John and Lori find Donny's residence and chase him and Robert to rescue Ted. The chase leads to Fenway Park, where John knocks out Robert, but during the chase Ted is damaged and falls onto the field torn completely in half. A police car arrives, forcing Donny to flee. As John and Lori gather his stuffing, Ted relays his wish that John be happy with Lori, as the magic that gives him life fades away.
Unable to accept his best friend's death, Lori and John return to her apartment to attempt repairing him, but it proves useless. That night, Lori, feeling profoundly guilty over her role in this tragedy, makes a wish on a falling star. The next morning, Ted is magically restored and the trio reconcile with Ted encouraging John and Lori to resume their relationship.
With that resolution, John and Lori are married (with Sam Jones as the presiding minister) and Ted comfortably accepts having a life of his own, with his misbehavior getting him somehow promoted to grocery store manager. Rex gives up his pursuit of Lori, goes into a deep depression, and dies of Lou Gehrig's disease. Sam Jones attempts to restart his career and moves into a studio apartment with Brandon Routh. Donny gets arrested for kidnapping a plush toy. The charges are eventually dropped because they sound too stupid. Robert hires a personal trainer, loses a significant amount of weight and goes on to become Taylor Lautner.

John Robert Procter

John Robert Procter, (16 March 1844 in Mason County, Kentucky – 12 December 1903 in Washington, D.C.) was an American geologist and civil service reformer. He was the Kentucky state geologist from 1880 to 1893, and president of the United States Civil Service Commission from 1893 to 1903.
Biography.
His mother died when he was very young, and he was brought up by an aunt. When he showed an inclination to enlist in the Confederate Army, his aunt sent him to the University of Pennsylvania to prevent this. He spent freshman year in a science program there, and then left and enlisted as a Confederate in 1863. He served until the end of the war. At the close of the war, he returned to his home farm in Kentucky, where he remained until 1873.
In 1873 he met Kentucky state geologist Nathaniel Shaler, also a Harvard professor. Procter became assistant in the Kentucky Geological Survey, and also studied geology during 1875 at Harvard. In 1880 he succeeded Shaler as state geologist.
As state geologist, he was brought into contact with the spoils system, to which his opposition was so uncompromising — he refused, even at the request of members of the state legislature, to remove competent assistants for political reasons — that he finally lost his position in 1893 when the Governor of Kentucky finally refused the support Procter which had received from that office in the past. Allegedly the Governor wanted to make some appointments for political and personal reasons. Procter had resisted these appointments advising that the geological survey office be closed rather than make it a machine to be used to advance political interests by letting out the offices for partisan ends.
His struggle with the spoils system brought him to national attention, and in the same year, at the recommendation of Theodore Roosevelt, Procter was appointed by President Grover Cleveland as president of the Civil Service Commission, a post which he held till his death. Procter's criticism of the spoils system was based not only on its evil moral and social effects, but also on its absurdity as a method of conducting business. He presented this view constantly and effectively. His work as president of the Commission was the means of increasing the effectiveness of the civil service, and of gaining for it recognition in political life.
During Procter's service on the Commission, the number of positions subject to the merit system increased from 43,000 to 120,000. In 1896, Procter secured the release of the positions of chief clerks and chiefs of divisions from the spoils system and had them filled by promotions or transfers from within the classified service.
Procter served as a member of the Jury of Awards at the Chicago World's Fair, and was a frequent contributor to magazines and journals on geologic, economic, international and political subjects. He was a member of the Century Club of New York City.
He died of angina pectoris while at the Cosmos Club in Washington, D. C., where he was attending the annual meeting of the National Civil Service Reform League.

HMS Mendip (L60)

HMS "Mendip" (L60) was a "Hunt" class destroyer of the Royal Navy. She was a member of the first subgroup of the class. The ship is notable for seeing service in the navies of three other nations after her use by the Royal Navy. She saw service in the Second World War and later as an Egyptian Navy ship in the Suez Crisis. She was captured in battle on 31 October 1956 by the Israeli Navy and re-commissioned as INS "Haifa" (K-38).
Construction and commissioning.
"Mendip" was ordered under the 1939 Naval Building Programme from Swan Hunter at Wallsend on 17 April 1939 She was laid down as Job No. J4111 on 10 August 1939 and launched on 9 April 1940. She was the first Royal Navy ship to carry the name of the Fox-Hunt in Somerset. Build was completed on 16 October 1941, and following a successful Warship Week National Savings campaign in March 1942 she was adopted by the civil community of Shepton Mallet, Somerset.
Career.
"Mendip" arrived at the Home Fleet's base at Scapa Flow on 14 October, but sustained damage when one of her own depth charges exploded during work up exercises. She was repaired and resumed work up on 18 February 1941. On 30 March she was assigned to the 21st Destroyer Flotilla at Sheerness for convoy escort and patrol duties in the North Sea and English Channel. From 1942 to 1944, she escorted 25 convoys through the North Sea.
She was lent to the Chinese Navy in May 1948, together with HMS "Aurora", and was renamed "Lin Fu", after major general Zhang Ling Fu, commander of the 74th division, who fell during the Chinese Civil War. After HMS "Aurora" (renamed "Chung King") defected to the communists in February 1949, she was repossessed by Royal Navy in June 1949 and re-commissioned with the ship's company of . She was sold to the Egyptian navy, becoming "Mohamed ali-El-Kebir" on 15 November 1949. She was renamed "Ibrahim-El-Awal" later in 1951.
Suez Crisis.
As part of the naval operations during the Suez crisis, Egypt dispatched the "Ibrahim el Awal" on 30 October 1956, to Haifa with the aim of shelling that city’s coastal oil installations. On 31 October the "Ibrahim el Awal" reached Haifa and began bombarding the city with her four 102 mm (4 inch) guns. The French destroyer "Kersaint", which was deployed in Haifa harbour to guard the port as part of Operation Musketeer, opened fire on the "Ibrahim el Awal" but scored no hits. Soon after, Israeli warships challenged the "Ibrahim el Awal" and the Egyptian warship immediately retreated. The Israeli warships gave chase and together with the Israeli Air Force, succeeded in damaging the vessel’s turbo generator and rudder. Left without power and unable to steer, the "Ibrahim el Awal" surrendered to the Israeli navy. The Egyptian destroyer was subsequently incorporated into the Israeli navy and renamed "Haifa".
She served with the Israeli navy through the late 1960s, when she was decommissioned. According to one source, she was relegated to duty as a target ship in 1968 and sunk as a target ship after being hit by a Gabriel missile. Other sources write that she was deployed for training duties until 1970, then relegated to the role of accommodation ship before being scrapped in 1972.

Colletes hederae

Colletes hederae, the Ivy Bee, is a species of plasterer bee belonging to the family Colletidae subfamily Colletinae.
These "mining bees" are known from Austria, Belgium, Channel Islands, Croatia, Cyprus, southern England, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland.
They have been only recently described (Schmidt & Westrich 1993) as a distinct species. Until then, they were confused with another species of "Colletes" the morphologically very similar "Colletes halophilus". 
The thorax of the adults is covered by orange-brown hair, while each abdominal segment has an apical orangey hair-band. The females are on average long, while the males are about long. 
The adults emerge late in the year (the males from late August and the females a little later in early September) and remain on the wing until early November. The principal pollen forage plant is Ivy ("Hedera helix") (hence the specific epithet "hederae"), but both sexes will also nectar at Ivy flowers too. When Ivy is scarce, other species of plants are also visited. The females supply the larval brood almost cells exclusively with nectar and pollen of ivy flowers. When Ivy flowering is delayed, females may also collect pollen at various members of the Daisy family (Asteraceae).
These are solitary bees and do not live in colonies and do not overwinter as adults. They nest in clay-sandy soils, especially in loess hills and soft-rock cliffs. Like many other solitary bees, they can often be found nesting in dense aggregations, sometimes numbering many tens of thousands of nests. In parts of the west European range of the species, "Colletes hederae" are fequently parasitized by the larvae of the meloid beetle "Stenoria analis", that feed on the supply of nectar and pollen prepared by females bees in their nests.

Hedychrum rutilans is a species of cuckoo wasps belonging to the family Chrysididae.
These cuckoo wasps are mainly present in Austria, Italy, Bulgaria, Greece, France, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and in North Africa.
The adults grow up to long and can be encountered from late June to September, mainly feeding on flowers of "Mentha" species, "Achillea millefolium" and "Euphorbia paralias", but also on honeydew or various exudates. They prefer sandy and warm habitats.
"Hedychrum rutilans" is a case of cleptoparasitism of Beewolf ("Philanthus triangulum" and "Philanthus coronatus"). The female cuckoo wasp lays its eggs on the paralyzed honeybees workers serving as provisions for the beewolf larvae, transported by the female beewolf in its brood cells. The cuckoo wasp larvae feeds on the honeybees and on larvae of the beewolf.

Sierra Sur de Jaén

The Sierra Sur de Jaén (Southern Range of Jaén) is a mountain range that is part of the central belt of the Baetic System, Andalusia, Spain. Its name derives from its location in the southwestern part of Jaén Province. The highest summit in the range is 1,872 m high Pico Pandera; 1,722 m high Cerro de la Cruz is another notable peak.
This range gives its name to an administrative comarca in the region, the Sierra Sur de Jaén Comarca, as well as to the wine of the area, the Sierra Sur de Jaén (DO).
Geography.
The Sierra Sur de Jaén is located in the area where the Subbaetic System is overlapping with the Prebaetic System. The latter begins east of Martos.
The Sierra Sur includes the subranges of Sierra de la Pandera, the Sierra de Ventisqueros, the Sierra del Trigo and the Sierra Caracolera, among others. The neighboring range of Sierra Mágina is located to the east of Sierra Sur de Jaén.
Most of the lower slopes and intermontane basins of the range are covered with olive groves. Some of the undisturbed higher slopes and hidden valleys of the mountains have preserved the original Mediterranean forest cover with Yew, Portuguese Oak, Holm Oak and Juniper trees. The highest altitudes of the range are mostly denuded of forest and thorny shrubland predominates. The mountaintops are usually covered with snow in the winter.
Otíñar is a zone of the range that includes ancient ruins and caves set in valleys among relatively unspoilt wilderness. It was declared Bien de Interés Cultural in 2009.
Geology.
The ranges of the Sierra Sur de Jaén, as well as the Sierra de Segura were formed during the Mesozoic. The geological materials that compose them were formed in a relatively shallow sea and are mainly made up of Cenozoic sedimentary rocks, including limestone, dolostone and marl.
Towards the east of the Sierra Sur de Jaén another mountainous subsystem begins, the Prebaetic System, an offshoot of the Subbaetic System stretching further northeastwards.

<doc id="31201893" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31201893" title="Karl Marx in film">
Karl Marx in film

Karl Marx and his ideas have been represented in film in genres ranging from documentary to fictional drama, Art house and comedy.
The Marxist theories of socialism, communism, class struggle, ideology and political economy influenced early Soviet-era filmmakers such as Dziga Vertov and Sergei Eisenstein. Eisenstein’s theory of montage owed its “intellectual basis to Marxist dialectics”. However, in addition to his philosophical influence on 20th century cinema and film-makers, Marx’s life and times and his principal works have all been represented in film as subjects in their own right.
Eisenstein’s project, dating from 1927, to film Marx’s book "Das Kapital" was never realised, although in more recent years the German film director and author Alexander Kluge completed a lengthy homage to Eisenstein’s unrealised film entitled "News from Ideological Antiquity: Marx - Eisenstein - Das Kapital".
In the 1960s French new wave directors, notably Jean-Luc Godard, used Marxist themes in their work, including in the films "Week End", "La Chinoise" and "Tout va bien".
In the 1970s the Serbian director Dušan Makavejev made films which were critical and/or satirical of Marx and Marxist ideology.
In 2007 it was reported that the Haitian director Raoul Peck was writing and directing a Karl Marx biopic about Marx's early life, although the film is yet to be released.
The 2011 documentary film "Marx Reloaded" combines a Marxian analysis of economic crisis with satirical animation sequences involving Marx and Leon Trotsky.
"Week End".
Jean-Luc Godard’s "Week End" is a story of a bourgeois Parisian husband and wife who decide to escape to the countryside for the weekend only to be confronted there by the social contradictions of their consumer lifestyle. The film makes frequent references to Marx and revolution, reflecting the wider social issues of French society at the time of its production.
"Sweet Movie".
In "Sweet Movie", directed by Dušan Makavejev, a boat with a giant Karl Marx figurehead sailing along a river is a consistent narrative motif. The film includes several characters, such as 'Mr. Kapital' (played by John Vernon), who refer to Marx and Marxist themes.
"News from Ideological Antiquity".
Alexander Kluge’s "News from Ideological Antiquity: Marx - Eisenstein - Das Kapital", is an experimental film which explores “the Marxian attention to the production, distribution and consumption at work behind the phenomenological surface of everyday life and experience.” The film is composed of what the Marxist critic Frederic Jameson calls “fragments”, akin to “Freudian free association”, rather than a conventional and linear narrative. Instead of representing Marx’s book "Capital", the film is therefore a study of the difficulty facing Eisenstein, or any other director, in trying to represent such a work and the ideas contained in it.
Apart from the more conceptual passages in the film - whose overall running time is a lengthy 570 minutes - comedian Helge Schneider impersonates Marx in several scenes.
"Marx Reloaded".
"Marx Reloaded", written and directed by the British theorist Jason Barker, is a partly animated documentary film which investigates the contemporary relevance of Marx’s ideas in the context of the global economic and financial crisis of 2008—09. The film asks whether “(we) should ... accept the crisis as an unfortunate side-effect of the free market” or whether there is “another explanation as to why it happened and its likely effects on our society, our economy and our whole way of life.” The film interviews several leading Marx-inspired philosophers and critics including Michael Hardt, Antonio Negri, Nina Power, Jacques Rancière, Peter Sloterdijk, Alberto Toscano and Slavoj Žižek.
In addition to its Marxian analysis the film follows “"The Matrix"-themed cartoon adventures of Karl Marx, lost in an Alice-style commodity-induced nightmare with only one way out.”
"Monty Python’s Flying Circus".
At least two episodes of the BBC TV comedy series "Monty Python’s Flying Circus" include sketches depicting Marx in modern-day settings, and which lampoon the presumed gravity of his thinking. In one episode Marx competes in a TV quiz show for a lounge suite but fails to win when the show's host poses him a prosaic question about football.

Omar El-Hariri

Omar Mokhtar El-Hariri was a leading figure of the National Transitional Council of Libya who served as the Minister of Military Affairs in 2011, during the Libyan civil war. He controlled the National Liberation Army and the Free Libyan Air Force from March to May 2011. Though he no longer serves on the council Executive Board after being replaced by Jalal al-Digheily, he still heads Military Affairs in the unicameral National Transitional Council legislature.
El-Hariri was involved in the initial 1969 coup against the monarchy that began Muammar Gaddafi's 42-year rule of Libya. He organised a plot to overthrow Gaddafi in 1975. When the coup was uncovered, 300 men were arrested, four of whom died during interrogation. Of the remainder, 21 were sentenced to death, including El-Hariri. He was imprisoned for 15 years from 1975 to 1990 under a death sentence, with four and a half years in solitary confinement. Gaddafi commuted the sentence in 1990 and El-Hariri was subsequently placed under house arrest until the Libyan civil war broke out in 2011. After breaking free of his detention, El-Hariri eventually became the political head of the National Transitional Council's armed forces.
In an interview with "The Globe and Mail", El-Hariri said of Libya's future, "They will elect a new president and he will serve for a limited time. He could be removed if he does not serve the people. And, of course, we will need a parliament, and a multiparty system."
On 19 May 2011, "The Economist" reported Jalal al-Digheily had been appointed "defense minister". Al Jazeera and The Jamestown Foundation later confirmed that Digheily had replaced El-Hariri. Unlike El-Hariri, Digheily was reportedly given a seat on the Executive Board of the National Transitional Council, while the "military affairs" department that El-Hariri had headed was afforded a seat on the council itself.

My Home Purchase Plan

My Home Purchase Plan is one of the public housing initiatives of Hong Kong. This plan enables eligible citizens to purchase homes by way of "rent-and-buy". The Plan aims to provide assistance to potential sandwich class home buyers who are able to repay mortgages in the long term but currently do not have enough savings for the down payment. This is plan is introduced by the Chief Executive of Hong Kong in the Policy address of Hong Kong 2010. The implementation of plan, that is the first 5000 flats under the plan is expected to be ready for sell in 2014.
Under this Plan, the Hong Kong Housing Society will lease the flats to eligible applicants at prevailing market rates. The tenancy period will be up to five years, within which the rent will stay put. After an occupation period of two years, tenants may purchase the flat they rent or another flat under the Plan at prevailing market price, or a flat on the private market. They will receive a subsidy equivalent to half of the net rental they have paid during the tenancy period, and use it for part of the down payment. Upon maturity of the five-year period, tenants will have to move out but still consider purchasing a flat within a period of two years.
My Home Purchase Plan has reserved five sites (i.e. Tsing Yi, Diamond Hill, Sha Tin, Tai Po, 
Tuen Mun) in building 5000 subsidized housing. Housings under this plan,is only exclusively for family applicants that have a household income of less than $39,000 a month and assets of no more than $600,000. The major target of the Plan are the "White Form" applicants while "Green Form" and singleton applicants will also be allocated certain quota. The first pilot project of My Home Purchase Plan is at Tsing Luk Street in Tsing Yi, and is estimated to have provide 1000 flats.
Background.
The private residential property prices has increased by 19% from September 2009 to September 2010, this phenomenon is attributable to the progressive economic recovery, low interest rate environment and the relatively tight supply of private residential flats in the past few years. The mortgage-to-income ratio in the second quarter was 41%, though it was lower than the average ratio of 53% over the past 20 years. This figure reveals the concern of the public on the recent increase on property prices. As the price of housing property in Hong Kong is skyrocketing, the amount of available mass market flats at affordable prices and overall supply of land for flat production in the long term is worrying. 
The Transport and Housing Bureau (THB) conducted a series of public consultations. Opinions on whether to subsidize home ownership were collected from May to 17 September 2010. Stakeholders and members of the public engage through different channels to look at matters related to the subject, in order to identify a way that can reassure concerns of the public.
The outcome of the public consultation showed that a lot of people are concerned about the rise in property prices and the difficulties in purchasing their first flat.
The Hong Kong Government recognizes the importance of home ownership to the public. It is the common will of the people to secure a stable home and to improve their quality of life. The Legislative Council of Hong Kong is of the view that the Government should introduce measures to help the sandwich class purchase their own flats, regarding the high property price. It is asserted that providing relief measures to sandwich class home buyers to give them time to save up is suitable. 
As a result, the Government, in collaboration with the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS), will introduce My Home Purchase Plan.
The Government's Housing Policy Objectives.
The Government's housing policy objectives are as follows –
(A) To provide subsidised rental housing for families in need.
The Government’s housing policy remains as "delivering the overarching objective of providing subsidised rental housing for families in need must continue to sit at the very heart of the Government’s housing strategy." This was announced in the "Statement on Housing Policy" by the then Secretary for Housing, Planning and Lands in November 2002. Hence, the government’s commitment to the provision of public rental housing (PRH) has not been changed.
(B) To uphold minimal market intervention.
Taking into account the government’s policy of minimal market intervention, other than PRH, the Government will continue to withdraw as far as possible from housing assistance programmes.
Under the minimal intervention approach, the government is firmly committed to provide a fair and stable
operating environment for the sake of the healthy development of the
private property market. Moreover, efforts are made to enhance the transparency of sales information and fairness of transactions of first-hand private residential properties in order to protect consumers’ rights;
(C) To maintain the steady development of property market.
It must be stressed that the Government place utmost importance in the home ownership needs of the Hong Kong citizens. This can be achieved by the government continuing to ensure a steady supply of land so that the residential property market can develop in a steady and healthy manner with low pressure of rising price.
(D) To nurture the "can-do" spirit of Hong Kong people.
It is recognized that home ownership is a matter of personal choice which is greatly related to individual circumstances and affordability. The Government is wary that any type of assistance provided should not erode
the key to Hong Kong’s success and the core of Hong Kong’s values, the "can-do" spirit of Hong Kong people.
Thus, the Government will facilitate the provision of different housing
options for different sectors of the community, rather than going back to the property market. Relevant policies includes working with the HKHS to implement a new form of assisted home ownership premised on the concept of "rent-and-buy".
The new scheme of "My Home Purchase Plan", together with measures
introduced to improve the transparency and fairness of
first-hand sales in the private sector, and the revitalisation
measures for the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) Secondary
Market Scheme (SMS), will increase choice to meet the
different housing needs of the community in a sustainable
manner
Content.
In this plan, Hong Kong government is going to give land to the Hong Kong Housing Society so as to construe flats of small and medium size for lease to qualified applicants at the current market rent. Without raising the rent within the period, the tenants can live in the flat at most for five years. During the period in which two years are passed after the first admission of the tenants, they have two choices: to purchase the flat they are living or alternatively another flat provided by My Home Purchase Plan at current market price, or else flats of private housing estate. Purchase Subsidy which is equal to half of the net rent will be provided. On the contrary, Purchase Subsidy will not be provided for the tenants who have not bought any flat under My Home Purchase Plan or in the private housing market within certain period of time.
Merits.
(A) Flexibility.
(i) Sandwich class people without enough savings for down payment can rent a flat, and then buy their own house later under MHPP.
(ii) Rental flats for a maximum five years will be provided so they can have enough time to ponder over their plan of buying houses and do not have to make careless decisions on purchase of flat. Therefore, they will bear lower risks.
(B) Helps accumulate savings.
As the rent will remain unchanged within the rental period, the tenants can take time to save up their money for down payment, which is the most difficult to be saved up.
(C) Greater upward mobility in the property market.
The majority of the quota will be allocated to White Form applicants, and the remaining quota will be allocated to PRH tenants. It will help the PRH turnover.
(D) Complements market inadequacy.
(i) HKHS is a non-profit-making, which provides flats with high efficiency.
(ii) MHPP flats help fill the shortage of "no-frills" in the primary private market.
Eligibility Criteria.
GF applicants and WF applicants are eligible to apply for MHPP if they meet the eligibility criteria. 
There will not be any restrictions on income and asset of the tenants of PRH estates and GF applicants, but if their application under MHPP succeeds, after they have moved into the flats under MHPP, they will be ordered to give the PRH units to the Housing Authority or HKHS.
However, WF applicants would have to meet the laid-down asset and income limits. Preliminary proposal on the income and asset limits is –
(a) Household applicants’ upper income limit is about $39,000 per month, and the upper asset limit is about $600,000; and
(b) Singleton applicants’ upper income limit is about $23,000 per month, and the upper asset limit is about $300,000.
In the future, HKHS will investigate and with regard the then market situation, set the income and asset limits, before it accepts applications for pre-letting of the Tsing Luk Street project.
First-time homebuyers are the targets of the scheme. Meanwhile, there will be strict criteria. It is proposed that applicants and other family members on the application forms should not have owned any residential properties for a period of ten years before the closing of the pre-letting application period. 
People who previously joined any form of Government subsidized home purchase schemes (e.g. HOS/Private Sector Participation Scheme, Tenants Purchase Scheme, Sandwich Class Housing Scheme, and the various home purchase loan schemes) are not eligible for MHPP.
No double benefit requirement.
Tenants who have bought a property under MHPP will not qualify for any other form of subsidy in the future housing schemes provided by the Government. However, if MHPP beneficiaries have great financial difficulties in future and are in real need of PRH, the Government may give discretion to exceptional cases.
Priority of different categories of applicants.
Applicants include 1) family applicants, 2) GF family applicants and 3) singleton applicants. The priority may be set by 1) ballot, 2) quota or 3) point system. 
Ballot is fair. But the remaining means are complicated in terms of administration. On balance of efficiency and fairness, a means premising on a quota system, and complemented with balloting will be considered. It is because such a set of criteria will be fairer, more focused and transparent.

Labweh

Labweh (), Laboue, Labwe or Al-Labweh is a village at an elevation of on a foothill of the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the Baalbek District of Lebanon.
History.
The Neolithic settlements represented at Labweh have been found dating to at least the 7th millennium BC. It has been suggested that it was known to the Egyptians as Lab'u, to the Assyrians as Laba'u and as Lebo-hamath to the Hebrews. This has been associated with the Hamath mentioned in the Book of Kings and the Book of Ezekiel noted as the Northern border of King Solomon's territory. Labweh in the original Syriac tongue means "heart" or "center", it also has been suggested to come from the Arabic for "lion" or "lioness". The village has several archaeological sites of interest including three old caves with Roman-Byzantine sarcophagi and the remains of a temple. There are also remains of a Byzantine bastion and a Roman dam suggested to date to the reign of Queen Zenobia. Legend suggests that channels were carved through the rock to send water to her lands in Palmyra, Syria.
Labweh Springs and Labweh River.
The village is located on a hill northeast of Baalbek, which gives its name to the Labweh Springs and Labweh River, one of the sources of the Orontes. The Labweh river flows for approximately through rocky desert. It then cascades into a lake and wider stream at another village called Er-Ras, considered to be the source of the Orontes. This flows onwards northeast, fed by numerous other streams from Lebanon's mountains.
Archaeological sites.
Soundings and analysis of archaeological sites in Labweh were made by Lorraine Copeland and Peter Wescombe in 1966 with later excavations by Diana Kirkbride in 1969. Tell Labweh, Tell Labweh South or Labweh I sits to the South of the village with another site to the North. The surface of Tell Labweh had been damaged by modern agriculture and it had been cut in half by road construction. Several burials were discovered inside the remains of rectangular buildings with white and red plaster floors. The remains of stone walls were found at lower levels and it is thought that the buildings may have used mud bricks at higher levels.
Early neolithic finds included a large number of fragments of limestone White Ware or "Vassille Blanche", along with later pottery called dark faced burnished ware or DFBW. Only one vessel was reconstructed from the initial excavations; a bowl with combed finishing. Other shards included jars and bowls of a black, brown or red colour, one showed a straw wiped finish normally found in sites further South in the Jordan Valley. Others showed decorations such as chevrons, incised patterns and corded impressions. Flints were similar to those found at Tell Ramad and included Byblos points, hooks, scrapers, borers and burins. Burials were found within two houses, which were excavated and found to be similar to those in earlier PPNB and PPNA sites. A range of sickle blades were found in the basal deposits and higher levels showing the evolution of denticulated and segmented cutting edges with similarities to those found at the oldest neolithic Byblos. Three initial samples were Radiocarbon dated suggesting a range of dates between 6780 to 6910 BC; a date range covering only c. 130 years. The range of finds at the site has however helped to reveal some aspects of the transition through neolithic stages.
Tell Labweh North is another large archaeological site, a few hundred metres north on the other side of the village and springs. Finely denticulated sickle blades, arrowheads and trapezoidal, flaked axes and fragments of white ware along with burnished pottery with patterns and a fragment of obsidian were collected from the surface of the site. Most of the finds indicated settlement around the time of Tell Labweh (South) and Byblos. Fauna would have included forest animals and numerous domesticated cattle, sheep and goats.
Roman temple.
There are the ruins of a Roman temple in the village that are included in a group of Temples of the Beqaa Valley. It was a prostyle type but only one block of the western wall remained visible. Modern construction built a house inside the temple. There are around twenty temples located between Labweh and Ain el-Baid.
