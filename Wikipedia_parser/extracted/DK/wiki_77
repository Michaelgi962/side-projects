Bukit Tabur

Bukit Tabur is a hill located in Taman Melawati, Malaysia. It is also known locally as Bukit Hangus. The hill is very prominent as it is part of Klang Gates Quartz Ridge and can be seen from the Kuala Lumpur Middle Ring Road 2. The hill, which is less than 500 metres, is a quartz ridge. Climbers enter the hiking trail via Kampung Klang Gates, 50 metres from the gates of the Klang Gates Dam, at the back of Taman Melawati for a 3-4 hour climb. The Gombak Forest Reserve and Klang Gates Dam are beside the hill. The peak offers view of the dam and panaromic views of Kuala Lumpur from the north. Several endemic species of plant such as "Aleisanthia rupestris" are known to grow here.
The hiking trail to Bukit Tabur can be found at .
Bukit Tabur is divided into the eastern and western section by the dam. Most hikers are familiar with the western section. The eastern side offers more challenging hikes but is said to be steeper and riskier if unfamiliar with the trail.
There has been a series of accidents on the trail including several fatal mishaps. It is likely that more restrictions will be imposed on hikers on this trail.

The Newark Targum

The Newark Targum is a weekly student newspaper published by the TargumPublishing Company for the student population of the Newark campus of Rutgers University. It is a weekly paper, with a circulation of 5,000 copies, printed each Wednesday during the academic year. It exists as a bi-fold tabloid-sized newspaper, similar to the "Daily Targum" the daily newspaper at Rutgers University published since 1869 on the university's main campus in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
'"The Newark Targum" strives to provide Rutgers–Newark students with the most in-depth, accurate news reporting on campus. 
The content of "The Newark Targum" is generated largely by student editors and reporters based at the Rutgers–Newark campus and at Rutgers' main campus in New Brunswick. Some content is shared between "The Newark Targum" and the "Daily Targum", especially with regards to issues relevant to the university community. "The Newark Targum" also prints content from The Associated Press, most notably on page 2 in the World Briefs column and occasionally in the sports section.
History.
The first issue of "The Newark Targum" was printed on February 15, 2006. Mid-fall semester 2005 an e-mail was sent to business manager Brad Whitson asking for The Daily Targum to be delivered to the Rutgers–Newark campus. From that e-mail a discussion between Whitson and editor-in-chief Nick Sevilis ensued, first focused on the logistics of transporting the daily paper to Newark from New Brunswick, and ending with a discussion of the logistics of creating a second newspaper with Rutgers–Newark as its main focus. Though little stock was placed in such a grand plan by either person, planning moved ahead swiftly as little resistance was met in the form of financial constraints by the printing and delivery companies. Promising too was the positive reaction from Rutgers–Newark students and administration. With a tentative budget set, the four student executives went to the company's Board of Trustees, which approved a test run of four issues. The paper received approval to continue printing until the end of the Fall 2006 semester, when it was discontinued.

Agus River

Agus River is a river that flows for 36.5 km from Lanao Lake to Iligan Bay, Philippines. It cuts through the provinces of Lanao del Sur and Lanao del Norte. Settlements along the banks of the river include the City of Marawi, the Municipality of Linamon and the City of Iligan. It separates into two channels as it drains to Iligan Bay; one going over the Maria Cristina Falls while the other supplies the Linamon Falls. The river descends for about from its source as it flows for before draining to the sea. The river is relatively shallow as it is only deep in some areas. The Agus River's watershed spans about 11,320.00 hectares. In 1992, the National Power Corporation financed the reforestation of the Lake Lanao-Agus River watershed, planting over 1500 hectares of "Acacia mangium", "Durio zibethinus" and other indigenous trees. It has a discharge of about 10 second-meters and flows from a narrow depression off the northwestern rim of the lake and flows over a basalt rock formation. The canyon carved by the river suggests a short erosional period.
Importance to humans.
The lake and the river are used for both commercial and sport fishing, as well as for recreational activities such as boating and swimming. The river in its entirety, however, is not navigable because the current in some areas reaches a velocity of up to thirty miles an hour. The NAPOCOR's hydroelectric project on the Agus River generates 70% of the electricity used in Mindanao due to the hydroelectric plants in the river and Maria Cristina Falls. However, the hydroelectric plants and the requisite regulatory dams have changed the fluctuations of the water level of Lake Lanao, affecting the indigenous people, producing conflicts with the local population.
In Maranao mythology, Lake Lanao once threatened to drown the people of Sebangan with its ever-rising waters. The Archangel Gabriel is thought to have made the Agus river in order to drain the lake.

Hemkund

"Not to be confused with Homkund"
Hemkund Sahib (also spelled Hemkunt), known as Gurudwara Sri Hemkunt Sahib Ji, is a Sikh place of worship and pilgrimage site in Chamoli district, Uttarakhand, India. It is devoted to Guru Gobind Singh Ji (1666–1708), the tenth Sikh Guru, and finds mention in "Dasam Granth", a work believed to be dictated by him. With its setting of a glacial lake surrounded by seven mountain peaks, each adorned by a Nishan Sahib on its cliff, it is according to the Survey of India located in the Himalayas at an elevation of . It is approached from Gobindghat on the Rishikesh-Badrinath highway. The main town near Gobindghat is Joshimath.
Etymology.
Hemkunt is a Sanskrit name derived from "Hem" ("Snow") and "Kund" ("bowl"). Dasam Granth says this is the place where Pandu Raja practiced Yoga.
Travel.
The take-off point for Hemkund Sahib is the town of Govindghat about from Rishikesh. The trek is along a reasonably well maintained path to the village of Ghangaria (also called Govinddham). This path can be covered either by walk or by pony and a Gurudwara here gives shelter to pilgrims. In addition there are a few hotels and a camp ground with tents and mattresses. A climb on a of stone paved path leads Hemkund. Overnight stay is not allowed at Hemkund Sahib and so it is necessary to leave by 2 PM to make it back to Govindghat by nightfall.
From Delhi, tourists take the train to Haridwar and then travel by bus to Govindghat via Rishikesh. It is also possible to drive from Delhi to Govindghat, a distance of about which takes around 18 hours to cover. Recently, an Indian airline company has started a helicopter service between Govindghat and Ghangria. The flight takes about 5 minutes. 
A recent study examining altitude sickness at Hemkund Sahib found that almost one-third of pilgrims who traveled to Hemkund suffered from Acute Mountain Sickness (a form of altitude sickness). As approximately 150,000 pilgrims are believed to travel to Hemkund Sahib each trekking season, almost 50,000 people are at risk of developing Acute Mountain Sickness each year. The authors stated the difficult nature of the trek, limited water consumption and lack of awareness regarding altitude sickness as the main contributory factors.
Present Gurudwara.
Design and construction of the present gurudwara was started in the mid-1960s, after Major General Harkirat Singh, Engineer-in-Chief, Indian Army visited the gurudwara. Major General Harkirat Singh selected Architect Siali to head the design and construction effort. Thereafter, Architect Siali luddu made annual trips to Hemkunt Sahib and organized and supervised complex construction.
Valley of Flowers.
About 3 km from Gobinddham is the 5 km long Valley of Flowers. The Indian Government has declared this valley a national park. It is situated in Nanda Devi Bio Reserve, and all activities are carefully regulated to preserve the valley in pristine condition. The best months to visit are July and August, during the monsoons. Legend has it that a flower called "Brahma-Kamal" blossoms here every 12 years. The trek to the valley is relatively easy and is a popular second destination for pilgrims visiting Hemkunt Sahib.

Home Meets.
Home meets are held in the 5,700-seat Sports Pavilion in Minneapolis. When large crowds are expected, meets are held in Williams Arena, capacity 14,321. This often happens for matches against archrivals Iowa and Oklahoma State. Several home matches each year are televised by the Big Ten Network. The school has also used Target Center in downtown Minneapolis for some matches.
NCAA Individual Champions.

The Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach Edition was an edition of the music of C.P.E. Bach projected between 1982 and 1995. Many noted musical scholars, such as Christopher Hogwood, were participants in it, and it had the support of the National Endowment for the Humanities. 
Unfortunately, although musicologist and contributor David Schulenberg states that several volumes were prepared by their designated editors, only four volumes ever saw publication, and at present these are out of print. (These four volumes were published by Oxford University Press.)
However, many of the same Emanuel Bach specialists involved in this abandoned edition are now involved in the preparation of "," an edition of C.P.E. Bach's music started in 2005.

Erhard of Regensburg

Saint Erhard of Regensburg was bishop of Regensburg in the 7th century. He is identified with an Abbot Erhard of Ebersheimmunster mentioned in a Merovingian diploma of 684. Ancient documents call him also Erard and Herhard.
Life.
According to the "Catholic Encyclopedia", "the legendary account of his life offers little that is historically certain." He was born in Ireland. Like many of his countrymen he went to the Continent as missionary bishop or chorepiscopus, and coming to the Vosges met there St. Hildulf, said to have been Archbishop of Trier, and who lived there as a hermit (666-671). He is called Erhard's brother, but very likely spiritual relationship was meant.
It is said that each of them founded seven monasteries. Thence Erhard went to Regensburg and founded the nunnery of Niedermünster. By Divine inspiration he was recalled to the Rhineland to baptize St. Odilia, blind from her birth, but who received her eyesight at her baptism. He sent a messenger to her father, Duke Attich, and reconciled him with his disowned daughter. According to another account, St. Odilia was baptized by Hildulf, Erhard acting as her sponsor. Theodo of Bavaria acted as Erhard's patron.
Death and burial.
The year of his death is not known. He was interred in the still-extant Erhard-crypt at Niedermünster, and miracles were wrought at his grave, that was guarded in the Middle Ages by "Erhardinonnen", a religious community of women who observed there a perpetual round of prayer.
Otto II, in 974, made donations of properties in the Danube valley to the convent "where the holy confessor Erhard rests". On 7 Oct 1052 the remains of the holy bishops Erhard and Saint Wolfgang were raised by Pope Leo IX in presence of Emperor Henry III and many bishops, a ceremony which was at that time equivalent to canonization. Regensburg documents, however, mention only the raising of Wolfgang, not that of Erhard.
At the close of the eleventh century, Paul von Bernried, a monk of Fulda, at the suggestion of Abbess Heilika of Niedermünster, wrote a life of Erhard and added a second book containing a number of miracles. The learned canon of Regensburg, Conrad of Megenberg (d. 1374), furnished a new edition of this work. The church in Niedermünster, now a parish church, still preserves the crosier of the saint, made of black buffalo-horn. A bone of his skull was enclosed in a precious receptacle in 1866 and is placed upon the heads of the faithful on his feast day, 8 January.
Three ancient Latin lives of the saint are found in the "Acta Sanctorum" (8 Jan). The beautiful reliquary is reproduced in Jakob, "Die Kunst im Dienste der Kirche" (illust. 16).
Trivia.
A beer brand from Bamberg, Germany is called St. ERHARD.

Philip of Agira

Saint Philip of Agira (also Aggira, Agirone, Agirya or Argira) was an early Christian confessor. There are two parallel stories of this saint which give to possible dates in which this saint lived. Traditionally, through the writings of St. Athanasius, it is maintained that Philip of Agira is a saint of the 1st century, born in the year AD 40 in Cappadocia (modern Turkey) and died on 12 May, AD 103. 
Another recent study says to have been born of a Syrian father in Thrace on an unknown date in the 5th century whose elder brothers drowned whilst fishing. Philip was known as the "Apostle of the Sicilians", as he was the first Christian missionary to visit that island. Nothing else can be certainly stated about him. 
His feast day is May 12, and he is naturally, patron saint of the city of Agira, Sicily, and of the city of Ħaż-Żebbuġ, Malta. Philip is one of the patron saints of the United States Army Special Forces.

Sunny Came Home

"Sunny Came Home" is a folk-rock song by American musician Shawn Colvin. It is the theme song to her 1996 concept album "A Few Small Repairs", and it was released as a CD single on June 24, 1997.
"Sunny Came Home" was a commercial success, reaching number seven on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart. The song was also a critical smash, winning both Grammy Award for Record of the Year and Song of the Year and was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.
About the single.
The song tells the story of a woman named Sunny who burns down her house to escape her past. It is one of several "story songs" on "A Few Small Repairs", a method of songwriting Colvin began experimenting with while writing for the album. The title of the song comes from the opening lyrics.
The song's bright, calm and warming music, fronted by a distinctive mandolin strum, contrasts very sharply with the destructive lyrics, particularly the haunting bridge: "Get the kids and bring a sweater; dry is good, and wind is better. Count the years; you always knew it / Strike a match; go on and do it". The title of the album, "A Few Small Repairs", also appears in the third line of the second verse of the song, "'It's time for a few small repairs,' she said."
At the end of the song, the lighting of a match can briefly be heard, followed by a quick breath to presumably put the flame out. The version that played on most radio stations was edited, as was the music video version, removing approximately 30 seconds of instrumental music, mostly at the end of the song.
Shawn Colvin confirmed the song is a murder ballad at her Perth, Western Australia concert on 3 April 2013.
Chart performance.
"Sunny Came Home" is Colvin's biggest hit. At the 1998 Grammy Awards, it was named Song of the Year and Record of the Year. The Grammy Awards presentation was the occasion for an interruption by rapper Ol' Dirty Bastard stating that his group, Wu-Tang Clan, "is for the children. We teach the children. You know what I mean?", while Colvin was about to receive her award. It peaked at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US, and likely would have achieved a higher peak had it been released commercially sooner to correspond with the song's airplay maximum: it was #1 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart for four weeks and also #1 on the Adult Contemporary chart for four weeks. On the Hot 100 Single Sales chart, however, it peaked at #29. Colvin's record label did not plan to release the track as a retail single until it became an airplay favorite on CHR as well as AC and Adult Alternative radio stations and the label deduced that the song appealed to a younger audience who might be willing to buy the single.

Microsoft Customer Care Framework

Microsoft Customer Care Framework (CCF) was a Microsoft .NET desktop-based framework which was used to address issues faced by service providers caused by multiple line of business (LOB) systems while interacting with their customers. It was discontinued though many of its core functions were moved to an add-in for the Microsoft Dynamics CRM product.
The Customer Care Framework provided a core set of functions for customer support avenues including voice call via call center agents and Internet portals. The framework used other Microsoft server products including the BizTalk Server, and SharePoint. CCF required the use of Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft IIS for the server side, which it uses to provide a base core set of web services.
CCF is targeted at medium to large enterprises. CCF was originally developed for the large call center requirements of the telecommunication industry.
CCF is different from most products from Microsoft in that it is not an 'out of the box' solution but requires development and configuration to build a working customer solution. The framework allows for a SOA methodology on development on the server and agent desktop side, but this is not mandatory and non-SOA development can be done and is normally the case.
CCF Components.
Agent Desktop.
The primary user interface for CCF is the agent desktop. This is a desktop-based user interface (UI) that presents data aggregated from various Line of business (LOB) & OSS/BSS application front ends and presents them in a unified view. CCF does not include an Agent Desktop application, rather samples including source code are provided as part of the framework.
Application Integration Framework (AIF).
The AIF manages the loading of the applications, integration and event brokering. Through the use of adapters (see HAT below) applications can have custom integrations to account for both the technology of the hosted application as well as business processing.
Hosted Application Toolkit (HAT).
HAT allows for the separation of the business rules and the method used to integrate with the application. HAT uses Microsoft Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) to manage the business rules, Data Driven Adapters (DDAs) to manage the application directly, and Bindings written in XML to connect the two. CCF 2009 SP1 ships with 3 DDAs: Win32, Web, and Java (JDK 1.6). DDAs can be customized or extended for additional application types as needed.
Releases.
Any version of Customer Care Framework before CCF 2009 SP1 QFE will break when upgrading to .NET Framework 3.5 SP1.
Similar Products.
Microsoft's Composite UI Application Block can be used to build composite applications within CCF, and a number of products similar to CCF are offered by other companies as well.

His regular doubles partner is fellow American John Isner.

Porto Cathedral

The Porto Cathedral (), located in the historical centre of the city of Porto, Portugal, is one of the city's oldest monuments and one of the most important Romanesque monuments in Portugal
The current Cathedral of Porto underwent construction around 1110 under the patronage of "Bishop Hugo" and was completed in the 13th century, but there is evidence that the city has been a bishopric seat since the Suevi domination in the 5th-6th centuries.
The cathedral is flanked by two square towers, each supported with two buttresses and crowned with a cupola. The façade lacks decoration and is rather architecturally heterogeneous. It shows a Baroque porch and a beautiful Romanesque rose window under a crenellated arch, giving the impression of a fortified church.
The Romanesque nave is rather narrow and is covered by barrel vaulting. It is flanked by two aisles with a lower vault. The stone roof of the central aisle is supported by flying buttresses, making the building one of the first in Portugal to use this architectonic feature.
This first Romanesque building has suffered many alterations but the general aspect of the façade has remained romanesque.
Around 1333 the Gothic funerary chapel of "João Gordo" was added. João was a Knight Hospitaller who worked for King Dinis I. His tomb is decorated with his recumbent figure and reliefs of the Apostles. Also from the Gothic period is the elegant cloister, built between the 14th and the 15th centuries during the reign of King John I, who married English Princess Philippa of Lancaster in Porto Cathedral in 1387.
The external appearance of the Cathedral was greatly altered during Baroque times. In 1772 a new main portal substituted the old Romanesque original and the tower cupolas were altered. Around 1732 Italian architect Nicolau Nasoni added an elegant Baroque loggia to the lateral façade of the Cathedral. During the War of the Oranges whilst the battle at Amarante was taking place a group of Spanish soldiers briefly took control of the Cathedral before being overcome by the locals of the town. A marble plaque with a Magnetite backing now hangs up behind the altar in order to remind everyone of those who lost their lives whilst regaining control of the chapel. The magnetite backing was chosen in order to remind those travelling near the cathedral by interfering with the direction in which their compass points,
The interior was also altered during the baroque era. In one of the chapels there is a magnificent silver altarpiece, built in the second half of the 17th century by Portuguese artists. Also in the 17th century the romanesque apse (which had an ambulatory) was torn down and a new one was built in baroque style, later decorated with new wall paintings by Nasoni and choir stalls. The altarpiece of the chapel, designed by "Santos Pacheco" and executed by "Miguel Francisco da Silva" between 1727 and 1729, is an important work of Portuguese Baroque.
The three red marble holy-water fonts, supported by a statue, date from the 17th century. The baptistery contains a bronze bas-relief by António Teixeira Lopes, depicting the baptism of Christ by John the Baptist.
The South transept arm gives access to the Gothic cloister, which is decorated with baroque azulejos by Valentim de Almeida (between 1729 and 1731). They depict the life of the Virgin Mary and Ovid's "Metamorphoses". The remains of the Early-Romanesque ambulatory contain a few sarcophagi. The terrace is decorated with tile panels by António Vidal. The coffered ceiling of the chapter house was painted with allegories of moral values by Pachini in 1737.

Dry Mesa Quarry

The Dry Mesa Dinosaur Quarry is situated in southwestern Colorado, USA, near the town of Delta. Its geology forms a part of the Morrison Formation and has famously yielded a great diversity of animal remains from the Jurassic Period, among them "Ceratosaurus", "Supersaurus", and "Torvosaurus". The quarry is found within the Uncompahgre National Forest.
History.
In 1971, a large theropod phalanx ("Torvosaurus" "tanneri") was discovered at Dry Mesa by Daniel and Vivian Jones [http://dinosaurjim.com/html/eddie___vivian_jones.html of Delta, Colorado. The find was reported to James A. Jensen of Brigham Young University (BYU) who commenced quarrying operations in 1972. Under the direction of the BYU Earth Science Museum, the quarry has been excavated for 13 field seasons. Approximately 4000 bones have been collected, making it one of the most prolific dinosaur producing accumulations in the Morrison Formation. Thirty vertebrate genera are represented in the quarry including dinosaurs, a pterosaur, crocodile, turtle, lungfish, and a prototherian mammal. Twenty-three genera of dinosaurs have been found in the quarry distinguishing it as the most diverse Jurassic dinosaur assemblage. The quarry is especially recognized for its large sauropods, among which "Supersaurus" "vivianae" [http://dinosaurjim.com/html/supersaurus_viviani.html and "Ultrasaurus" "mcintoshi" [http://dinosaurjim.com/html/ultrasaurus_mcintoshi.html] are the most celebrated finds (Richmond and Morris, 1999).
Geology.
The Dry Mesa Dinosaur Quarry of western Colorado yields one of the most diverse Upper Jurassic vertebrate assemblages in the world. This fossil assemblage was deposited within a poorly sorted sandstone bed that is stratigraphically situated in the lower portion of the upper Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation. The bone accumulation, consisting of thousands of bones, was the consequence of two cataclysmic events, a drought, and flash flood. In the Dry Mesa area, a severe drought resulted in the mass mortality of dinosaurs and other vertebrates. These animals were attracted to a remnant water hole of the dry Lake T'oo'dichi' lake bed where they died of starvation and dehydration. This mass mortality produced a considerable accumulation of disarticulated vertebrate remains. Subsequently, a short-lived flash flood traversed the dry lake beds. The quarry sandstone bed is a 2 meter thick, 121 meter wide, very poorly sorted pebble-rich sublitharenite. The channel sandstone shows abundant trough cross-stratification and a possible antidune bedform composed of gravel and sand which indicates flow velocities as high as 200 cm/s (5 miles/hour). Measured bone volumes can be equated to flow velocities. These calculated bone volume velocities are in agreement with flow velocities determined from grain size and bedforms. The river flow direction, based upon bedform orientations and bone elongation statistics, was to the east-northeast. Geologic and taphonomic characteristics indicate a short transport distance for the bone accumulation (Richmond and Morris, 1999).

Ken Smith (politician)

Kenneth Maurice "Ken" Smith (born 30 December 1944) is an Australian politician who is currently the member for Bass in the Victorian Legislative Assembly. He was Speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 21 December 2010 to 4 February 2014.
Smith was a plumber before he entered the Parliament of Victoria in 1988, winning the Legislative Council seat of South-Eastern Province for the Liberal Party. During his time in the Legislative Council, Smith served on the backbench, although after being returned at the 1996 election he served as government Whip. When the Kennett government lost power in 1999, Smith continued on as Opposition whip.
The redistribution prior to the 2002 election abolished his upper house province, and Smith decided to contest the new seat Lower House seat of Bass—basically a reconfigured Gippsland West. He faced Susan Davies, the MP for Gippsland West. While the election was a disaster for the Liberal Party, Smith provided them with their only gain, winning the seat after Davies was unable to finish ahead of the Labor candidate and win on their preferences. 
Smith served as Shadow Minister for Gaming and Shadow Minister for Fisheries.
In 2008 Smith put forward a private member's bill that would allow euthanasia in Victoria. The bill was similar to the Dying With Dignity Act in Oregon in the United States, and generated considerable controversy. The bill was defeated in the Victorian Legislative Council.
In 2009, Smith was unopposed for preselection for the seat of Bass and was re-endorsed by the Liberal Party as their candidate.
On 21 December 2010, Smith was elected unopposed as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly for the 57th Victorian Parliament. In late 2013, former Liberal MP Geoff Shaw declared that he had no confidence in Smith's speakership, after the Speaker had referred allegations regarding Shaw's use of parliamentary entitlements to the Victorian Ombudsman. From this time, 44 members (43 of them from the Labor opposition) lacked confidence in Mr Smith continuing as Speaker, with 43 members as well as Mr Smith himself maintaining confidence. 
On 4 February 2014, Smith stood down as Speaker but announced he would remain an MP until the state election due in November, when he would retire.

Kelly Joe Phelps

Kelly Joe Phelps (born October 5, 1959, Sumner, Washington, United States) is an American musician and songwriter. His music has been characterized as a mixture of delta blues and jazz.
Career.
Kelly Joe Phelps grew up in Sumner, Washington, a blue-collar and farming town. He learned country and folk songs, as well as drums and piano, from his father. He began playing guitar at age twelve.
Phelps concentrated on free jazz and took his cues from musicians like Ornette Coleman, Miles Davis, and John Coltrane. He spent 10 years playing jazz, mostly as a bass player. He refers to his "conversion" to a blues musician when he began listening to acoustic blues masters like Fred McDowell and Robert Pete Williams.
Initially gaining notice for his solo lapstyle slide guitar playing, which he played by laying the instrument flat and fretting it with a heavy steel bar, he has incorporated more ensemble work in his later albums. Inspired by the birth of his daughter Rachel in 1990, Phelps began writing songs. He began singing and released his critically praised debut, "Lead Me On", in 1995. This album showcased Phelps' craft, and as well as his own songs, he tackled traditional numbers such as "Motherless Children" and "Fare Thee Well." 
He released his second album, the gospel influenced "Roll Away the Stone" (1997) and followed it up with 1999's, "Shine Eyed Mister Zen". 
His fourth record, "Sky Like a Broken Clock", appeared in 2001. This time he was joined by a bassist and a drummer - its companion piece, "Beggar's Oil" EP, was a critic's favourite in 2002. In order to achieve a richer, orchestrated sound on "Slingshot Professionals", released in 2003, he collected a wider collection of musicians to play guitar, bass, drums, mandolin, violin, and accordion.
In 2005, Phelps released a live album, "Tap the Red Cane Whirlwind", which was followed a year later by the studio album "Tunesmith Retrofit". In 2009 he released an album of instrumentals titled "Western Bell". Following the release of that CD, he began recording and touring with the American singer-songwriter Corinne West. In January 2013, he announced that he was taking a hiatus from touring due to ulnar neuropathy in his right hand and arm.

Star Kingdom

Star Kingdom (formerly known as Star King) (1946–1967) was a Thoroughbred race horse bred in Ireland in 1946. Exported to Australia he was an outstanding sire, being the leading sire for five seasons, the leading sire of two-year-olds seven times as well as heading the broodmare sires' list three times.
Foaled on 30 April 1946, Star Kingdom was bred by Richard Ball, master of Cloghran Stud, in County Dublin, Ireland. Star Kingdom was a son of Stardust and out of the unraced mare, Impromptu by Concerto. He was inbred to Sunstar (who won the 2,000 Guineas Stakes and the Epsom Derby), in the fourth generation (4m x 4f). Wilfred Harvey purchased him at the Doncaster sales for 3,100 guineas.
Racing record.
Star Kingdom was registered and raced under the name of Star King in England. Conditioned for racing by John Waugh, in his two-year-old racing season he was rated second (to Abernant) among English sprinters. Out of 16 starts he recorded nine wins and was unplaced only four times collecting £12,352 in stakes. His wins included the York Gimcrack Stakes and the Sandown Park Produce Stakes. All of his wins, with the exception of one, were by long margins of up to ten lengths.
Stud record.
Star Kingdom was purchased by Stanley Wootton at a cost of £4,000 and sent to Australia in 1951. Upon arrival it was obvious that he had not travelled well and he stood only 15 hands and a ½ inch high, leaving his purchasers with serious doubts about the wisdom of their choice. As there was already a Star King in Australia he was re-registered as Star Kingdom and installed at Baramul Stud in New South Wales. His influence was not immediately felt, but eventually he became Australia's leading sire for the first time in the 1958-59 season when his fifth crop began racing although he was the leading sire of two-year olds in his first season and the first sire whose earners were to reach the equivalent of $2 million. Star Kingdom was the leading sire five times, leading sire of two-year-olds seven times as well as leading the broodmare sires' list thrice.
One of his most extraordinary achievements was to sire the winner of the first five Golden Slipper Stakes. Primarily a speed sire his influence is still evident in the bloodlines of many Australian Thoroughbreds today. His progeny held Australian records for 4 furlongs, 5 furlongs, 5½ furlongs, 8 furlongs and 10 furlongs at various times.
Among his offspring were 52 stakeswinners, including the outstanding horses Biscay, Citius, Concert Star, Todman, Fine and Dandy, Noholme, Reveille, Time And Tide, Sky High, Skyline, King Star, Kingster, Star Affair, Planet Kingdom, Kaoru Star (sire of Luskin Star, a Triple Crown winner), Mighty Kingdom, Gold Stakes, Magic Night, Starlit, Cymbal, Courteous, Sunset Hue (sire of Gunsynd) and Ritmar. The top racehorse Sky High was his most prolific winner, recording 29 wins.
Star Kingdom was also a noted broodmare sire with the likes of his daughter Dark Jewel producing Baguette, a Golden Slipper Stakes winner who was unbeaten in his two-year old season and future sire of note.
Standing at Barramul Stud for 16 successive seasons (1951–1966) he died from a bowel blockage, at the age of 21, on 21 April 1967. A headstone at Baramul Stud commemorates him and his son, Todman.
In 1978, more than 11 years after Star Kingdom's death, he had at least 42 sons standing at studs in Australia and New Zealand, including the very successful Kaoru Star. At the same time he also had over 100 grandsons standing at stud.

In 2012, writer Chris Yost chose the Texas team the Rangers to come into conflict with Houston's new superhero Scarlet Spider in the story "The Second Master" in "Scarlet Spider" #7-9. In an interview with Comic Book Resources, at a question about the antagonists in the story, Chris Yost answered "You'll also be seeing a well known super-hero group from the American southwest named -- wait for it -- The Rangers! Texas Twister! Shooting Star! Red Wolf! Living Lightning! Firebird! Even a new hero or two! And spoiler alert -- Scarlet Spider will fight them.".
Shooting Star has entries in the "Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe" vol.1 #10, "OHOTMU Deluxe Edition" #11 and "Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A To Z Update" #2 (2010).
Fictional character biography.
Origins.
Shooting Star was born Victoria Starwin, in El Paso, Texas. She is the daughter of Remington Starwin, a wealthy Texas oil baron and amateur rodeo performer. When she was a child, her father encouraged his daughter's aspirations to perform professionally in rodeos. He hired scientists to build for her a special six-shooter that shoots star-shaped paralysis pellets for her sharp-shooting act. At some point in her performing career, she met a rodeo performer and former superhuman adventurer, the Texas Twister, and the two formed a dual act. Her father then had scientists design a pair of jet-boots that enabled her to stabilize her flight when swept up in the Twister's cyclonic vortex.
Rangers.
Shooting Star and Texas Twister were the star attractions at Cody's Rodeo Extravaganza when they intercepted a shortwave radio message sent by Rick Jones meant for the hero team known as the Avengers. Jones was being held captive by the villainous Corruptor, who had the Hulk under his influence. Shooting Star and Texas Twister went to answer the distress call and discovered that three other individuals had responded as well — Firebird, the Phantom Rider (then called Night Rider), and Red Wolf. Although the five Southwestern adventurers were unable to stop the Hulk's rampage, they did enable him to defeat the Corruptor. At the battle's end, Texas Twister suggested that the five of them get together whenever a threat to the Southwest crops up. They agreed and took the collective name of the Rangers. However, because of the geographical separation among the members, the first incarnation of the Rangers did not last long.
Shooting Star's identity was at some point taken over by a demon named Riglevio in the employ of Master Pandemonium, who believed Firebird to be one of the possessors of his fragmented soul. To keep the Rangers from meeting regularly and perhaps posing a threat to him before he had completed his study of Firebird, Pandemonium dispatched the demon to take Shooting Star's place. Firebird nevertheless believed the demon to be hiding among the Avengers' West Coast branch and with her guidance the Rangers confronted the heroes, only to flush the demon in Shooting Star out of hiding. The demon claimed that Shooting Star was a human guise it had taken long before, that there never was a Victoria Star. The Avengers imprisoned the demon at their Compound and began an investigation of Master Pandemonium, but the Texas Twister, demonstrating a curious lack of concern, did not accompany them.
Soon, however, Texas Twister returned to the Avengers Compound at a time when Hawkeye was alone, demanding to see the captive demon. Twister declared his love for the demon, which turned back into Shooting Star. Texas Twister went on to explain that the demon had come to him months ago when Twister's powers seemed to be fading, making him afraid that he'd lose Shooting Star if their rodeo act broke up on account of his lost powers. The demon offered to augment the Twister's powers in exchange for his soul, and the Twister agreed, but after his powers were restored he begged to be spared, so the demon possessed Shooting Star instead, casting a spell that prevented Twister from telling anyone about this. Twister studied the occult until he found a means to expel the demon from Star. The demon then possessed Twister himself and battled Hawkeye and Shooting Star. Ultimately, Star threatened to kill the demon rather than allow the possession to continue, and the demon reluctantly imprisoned itself in a statue. Texas Twister and Shooting Star were reunited.
Initiative/Secret Invasion.
After the Civil War event, as a registered hero, Victoria Starvin trained at Camp Hammond, before becoming a member of Texas' new government-sponsored superhero team, the Rangers. Using a floating base called a 'Terrorcarrier', HYDRA attacks Crawford, Texas, a vacation spot for President George W. Bush. Shooting Star is seen attempting to convince the President to leave his home and get to cover away from the HYDRA attack, but he refuses, saying he has faith in the Initiative. The superheroine and her fellow Rangers join a large group of heroes in attacking the carrier which is destroyed and the President is unharmed.
Shooting Star later helps the Initiative repel the Skrull invasion. She begins to succumb to a lethal gas used by the Skrull impersonating Yellowjacket, but is saved by the quick intervention of the super-speedster Whiz Kid (on the original script, she was yanked away in time by Great Lakes Avengers member Flatman) and recovers immediately.
The Rangers come into conflict with Kaine alias Scarlet Spider in Houston, then they joined forces with him to battle a monster made of pure energy.
Skills, abilities and equipment.
Shooting Star has no known superhuman powers, although in her initial appearance she claimed to have "stellar powers." She is an expert markswoman and rodeo rider. Shooting Star wears a pair of specially-designed "star shooters", which look like six-shooters but which actually shoot projectiles made of an unknown material, shaped like five-pointed stars. The stars paralyze living beings they hit, with one star capable of paralyzing a man for approximately 30 minutes. She wears boots which contain miniature gyroscopes, which keep her oriented correctly as she rides the winds generated by Texas Twister.
Other versions.
In "Fantastic Four Big Town", Shooting Star is a blonde superhero created by Professor X and Henry Pym. Her real name is "Vicki" and she possesses flight and energy powers which manifest as glowing circles around her hands.

Traditional Apache scout

The phrase traditional Apache scout refers to members of the Apache tribe who engaged in scouting, either for game or during time of war. Only Lipan, Chiricahua and Mescaleros had scout societies. The scouts' original purpose was to protect the clanspeople from enemies, and to locate game and new campsites. It is important to distinguish between these scouts, and the Apache Scouts hired by the United States Army during the Indian Wars.
Training.
The scouts trained their own clansmen in an intense process that lasted over ten years. Young children within the clan would be closely observed by current scouts and elders. Those who showed promise in skills—such as awareness, tracking and hunting, physical fitness, and selflessness—would be selected to undergo the training process.
Training included advanced techniques of camouflage and invisibility as well as of observation and stalking. These skills led to their nicknames as "shadow people" and "ghosts". The scouts became masters of wilderness survival, excelling beyond the skills of the lay clansmen. This was necessary, for they often had to leave the clan for extended periods of time with nothing but a buckskin loincloth and perhaps a stone knife.
The scouts were taught a highly complex system of tracking, utilizing miniature topographic features within each footprint. These features could tell the trackers anything from the speed at which the quarry was moving, to the direction the quarry was looking. Some tracking experts, such as Tom Brown, Jr., assert that scouts could know whether the quarry was hungry, pregnant, or had to urinate, and to what degree.

Railway Square, Sydney

Railway Square is a plaza at the southern end of central Sydney, Australia, formed by the confluence of Broadway, Lee Street, Pitt Street and George Street. The square itself is a very busy intersection and is the site of a large bus terminus. The University of Technology, Sydney (UTS), Central railway station and the now-closed Kent Brewery are adjacent to Railway Square.
History.
Railway Square was originally known as Central Square. In the 19th century and early 20th century, Central Square was the heart of the city's modern retail district, enhanced by the presence of Central railway station and its adjacent hotels, erected to serve country visitors arriving in Sydney by train. The Marcus Clark department stores were located in a number of buildings at Central Square. The Parcel Post Office in Lee Street was built in 1913, having been designed by George McRae, the government architect. It was later restored and converted to the Medina Hotel.
The area was previously a busy nexus for the electric tramways of Sydney until the system's closure in the late 1950s.
Until the 1990s, Railway Square had a three-platform bus terminal in its centre. The platforms were connected to one another, as well as the opposite sides of Lee Street and Broadway, by an extension of the Devonshire Street tunnel. The tunnel was accessible by escalator. 
The site was redeveloped in 1999 to incorporate two platforms, lifts, a cafe and access to the University of Technology, Sydney. The site was fitted with public artwork created by Merilyn Fairskye, including murals, illuminated wall panels and four towers with coloured steel ribbons inside, representing the four elements (Air, Water, Earth and Fire). Railway Square is dominated by the rising glass bus terminal structure, and by four sculpture light towers. The area is now an interchange for the city's 300 series, 400 series, 501 and some 600 series bus routes.
Rail tunnel.
Railway Square is not only traversed underneath by the extension of the Devonshire Street pedestrian tunnel, but also by a railway tunnel that runs underneath at the southern end of the square. The tunnel was part of the Metropolitan Goods line linking the main lines south from Central with Darling Harbour. This tunnel is the oldest railway tunnel in New South Wales and is now only used as a service line to the Powerhouse Museum.

Ella May Saison

Ella May Saison (also credited as Ella Mae Saison) is a Filipino singer. She is acknowledged as the original 'Queen of Soul of the Philippines'. 
Career.
Saison began her recording career at age 19. Prior to landing a recording contract, she was a soloist for the Artstart Band, specializing in jazz, gospel, and blues. In the Philippines, she is best known for her hits "Till My Heartaches End" and "If The Feeling Is Gone", subsequently covered by Passage and Kyla, respectively. Saison won the Katha Award for Best Female Performer, and she was also recognized in the Philippines for one Gold and one Platinum album. 
A year after her second album release, she signed a recording deal with Evander Holyfield's independent record label, Kats Eye, and released "So In Love" in 1997. The songs "So In Love" and "Never Had A Chance" were released as singles. Andrew Rollins and Don Williams were producers, songwriters and musicians on the album except for "Never Had A Chance" which was co-written by Judith Jordan, Ronnie Hammon and Rollins. Jerry Brown was the engineer. The album was recorded at A&M Studios. Humberto Gatica was also an engineer.
In addition to working with Humberto Gatica (producer of Celine Dion), she has worked with Gerry Brown (producer of Vanessa Williams) and artists such as The Eagles and IV Xample. Timothy B. Schmit of The Eagles contributed background vocals to the "So In Love" album, as did Eagles contemporary John David Souther.
There has been a degree of controversy associated with the credits to "So In Love". It is contended that Saison specifically worked with Bryant Woodert (PKA Lucius) of IV Xample, who produced her vocals for the title song to the album. This song, written by Don H. Williams and Andrew Rollins, went on to win an award in the Philippines for best vocal production. Bryant Woodert never received any credit for doing vocal production, though he is listed as a background singer on the album credits (under Lucius of IV Xample). Though Gerry Brown was the engineer for this session, it is contended that he did not participate in any vocal direction, even though he and Andrew Rollins were given the credit for this. Andrew Rollins, who was said to be in New York at the time of the recording, later received the Philippine award for best vocal production.
Saison released a single with CeCe Peniston entitled "Reminiscin", which made the Billboard Charts under the "Powerpick Club Play" category, hitting number 30. Peniston's opinion of Saison is as follows: "(In) January 2001, we collaborated on a duet titled "Reminiscin" that charted on 'Billboard's Club Playlist'. I was fortunate to witness the warmth of a beautiful personality and the great talent of a rising star. I hope the world will be allowed to share in this experience too." Saison also performed at the Awards Dinner of the Republic of South Africa and the African Times in honor of President Nelson Mandela. She recently sung the "Star Spangled Banner" at the Countrywide Classic/ATP US Open Series at UCLA last July 17, 2007.
In the early 2000s, her focus became more regional than national, when she joined Los Angeles-based covers band Dark Sunday, as lead singer, where she was well-received.
She returned to the Philippines in 2005, to great acclaim, but then left again for California in the United States where she continues her career.
In July 2011, Saison performed "Till My Heartaches End" on "Party Pilipinas".

Mark Wynter

Mark Wynter (born Terence Sidney Lewis, 29 January 1943) is an English actor and former singer, who had four Top 20 singles in the 1960s, including "Venus in Blue Jeans" and "Go Away Little Girl". He enjoyed a lengthy career from 1960 to 1968 as a pop singer and teen idol, but developed later into an actor in film, musicals and plays.
Career.
With his early musical career on a proper footing, Terry Lewis decided to change his name to lessen the confusion with the American comedian, Jerry Lewis.
He was entered as one of the contenders for the UK's place in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1961, with "Dream Girl", but finished fourth behind The Allisons.
His cover version of the American hit by Jimmy Clanton - "Venus in Blue Jeans" (1962) - was his biggest success. Although he recorded a number of singles for the Decca and Pye labels in the UK, he made few albums. Some recorded material came to light in 2004 when Wynter discovered old tapes, which have subsequently been remastered and are now available as four CDs. These were entitled "I Believe in Music", "Reflections", "Ballads and Big Band" and "Movies and Musicals". 
In 1968 Wynter escorted a dazed young girl away from a burning BOAC aircraft, flight 712, upon which he had been a passenger.
Wynter played the leading role in "Conduct Unbecoming" for more than a year at the Queen's Theatre in London, and for six months in Australia. He appeared with Julia McKenzie in "On the Twentieth Century", and in "Charley's Aunt". He also starred in "Side By Side By Sondheim" in Toronto, Chichester, and on the UK tour. In the 1982 Chichester Festival season he acted in several plays including "On The Rocks" and "Henry V", and also sang in "Valmouth". His other work in musicals during the 1980s included the role of the King in a revival of "The King and I", the title roles in "Hans Andersen" and "Barnum", the 1986 revival of "Charlie Girl" with Cyd Charisse and Paul Nicholas in London, and the part of Robert Browning in "Robert and Elizabeth". During the 1990s Wynter spent two years in "Cats", and was also seen as the Phantom and M. Andre in "The Phantom of the Opera", and starred as Vittorio opposite Bonnie Langford in the 1998 West End revival of "Sweet Charity". He has appeared frequently in the provinces and portrayed Emile de Becque in a UK national tour of "South Pacific". In 1994 he created the role of Van Helsing in the studio recording of the opera/musical "Nosferatu" by Bernard J. Taylor.
His warm, melifluous speaking voice was heard many times on BBC Radio 2 during the early 1990s when he presented daytime shows as well as documentaries such as "Happy Times", a programme about the American entertainer Danny Kaye, which was nominated for a New York radio award.
Wynter was still working actively and successfully in theatre throughout the English speaking world well into the 1990s. Although his Decca singles output is scattered in the CD catalogue, in 2000 Castle Communications released "Go Away Little Girl: The Pye Anthology", a double album compiling his complete output for the label. In 2007, Wynter toured the UK in a number of plays and musicals.
Personal life.
He now lives in Sussex, and tours the country with an Agatha Christie theatre company. He is married to Emma, and has three children; Barnaby, Josh and Darcey.

Hōjō Tokiyuki

Tokiyuki had fought against both the Imperial forces and those of the Ashikaga in order to save the Kamakura shogunate, of which his clan had been the ruler for over a century. After the 1333 siege of Kamakura, his father's seppuku and the almost complete destruction of his family, he escaped to Shinano province and the home of Suwa Yorishige, where he gathered an army with which to return and try to regain power. He re-entered Kamakura in 1335, forcing Ashikaga Tadayoshi to flee before he was forced to flee himself by Tadayoshi's elder brother and future shogun Ashikaga Takauji.
Shortly after his defeat, Tokiyuki asked to be pardoned by Emperor Go-Daigo, and formally entered into the service of the Southern Court, fighting under the command of Kitabatake Akiie, and later Prince Munenaga. He also aided in the 1352 recapture of Kamakura, led by Nitta Yoshioki. However, when Nitta was pursued by Ashikaga Takauji and sought refuge in Echigo Province, Tokiyuki fled to Sagami province, where he was discovered and beheaded by forces loyal to the Ashikaga.

Alexandra College

Alexandra College is a private, single-sex girls' school located in Milltown, Dublin, Ireland, operating under a Church of Ireland ethos. It serves girls from ages 4 to 18 as boarding or day pupils. The school is one of the most prestigious in Ireland and ranks highly in Leaving Certificate results tables. It is also one of the most exclusive fee-paying schools in all of Ireland.
History.
The school was founded in 1866 and takes its name from Princess Alexandra of Denmark, the school's patron. The school colours, red and white, were adopted from the Danish flag in her honour. Alexandra College was founded by Anne Jellicoe, a Quaker educationist, in the name of furthering women's education. Under Anne Jellicoe, the school grew from a small establishment focused on providing a governess-style education to Irish Protestant ladies into a pioneering force for women's rights and education, providing an education to women equivalent to that available in boys' schools, with a grounding in mathematics, history, classics and philosophy. As Alexandra settled into its role, Ann Jellicoe was convinced that a major obstacle to the liberal education of women was their exclusion from the university campus. She passionately believed that until women were admitted to Trinity College Dublin (founded in 1592), the voice of women would not commonly be heard in politics, literature or in academic debate.
The Royal University of Ireland Act 1879 allowed females to take university degrees on the same basis as males. Students were prepared for the examinations (including degree examinations) of the Royal University. Susan Parkes, co-author of "Gladly Learn and Gladly Teach", a history of Alexandra College (1866-1966), is quoted as saying: "In the late 1800s, lecturers from Trinity College Dublin provided tuition for ladies on the Alexandra campus. And the first women to receive degrees in Ireland or Britain were Alex pupils — six of them successfully studied at Dublin's Royal University from 1891 and at Trinity College Dublin, once it opened its doors to women in 1903."
The school was originally situated in the historic Earlsfort Terrace, across from what is now the National Concert Hall. By 1879, a new hall and theatre were constructed alongside. Over time, the school acquired several more houses and by 1889 a new building by William Kaye-Parry was constructed next door to the college as Alexandra School. The school moved out to its sports grounds in the 1960s in order to accommodate more students. The original buildings were subsequently demolished and the site remained vacant for over two decades. The Conrad Hotel and office buildings were later erected on the site.
The patriot and leading figure in the Easter 1916 uprising Padraig Pearse was once employed as an Irish language teacher. The first ever international hockey match was held on the Alexandra College hockey pitch. It was England vs Ireland, and Ireland won 1-0.
Religion.
Alexandra College is under Church of Ireland management, and the Archbishop of Dublin (who presides over the United Dioceses of Dublin and Glendalough) currently acts as chairman of the school council. The students are addressed weekly by a female minister, and a school assembly is held daily at which Church of Ireland hymns are sung and which finish with the extended version of The Lord's Prayer.
Junior School.
The attendance fees for the primary school are in fact higher than the secondary school due to the high number of teachers of specialized subjects for students with learning disabilities which are not subsidized by the government on the payroll. The preparatory department classes wear a red tracksuit, which the older classes wear only for sports, wearing the brown uniform of the secondary school for normal classes along with a red tie. The majority of Junior School pupils go on to study at the Senior School.
Alexandra College today.
A wide range of subjects is available to study. The school crest reflects this, featuring a cross with a book, a ball, a lyre and a palette in its corners. The school was greatly benefited in 2004 with the opening of the Milltown Luas stop at the back gate of the college.
In the senior school, 1st-4th years wear the traditional brown uniform. 5th and 6th year students do not wear the school uniform; they must however wear clothes suitable for school; this is meant to promote the girls' individuality. For one day in 6th year the girls put back on their brown uniforms, this is for the summer funday which has become a tradition in the school as fundays are 'non-uniform' days with themes. This day is generally just before graduation.
Charity work of the girls.
Undertaking charitable initiatives has always been a feature of school activities in Alexandra College. In the spring of 2005 a group of teachers decided to support the work of the Irish Nepalese Educational Trust, http://www.inetireland.ie in trying to build a new primary school in Phuleli, a remote village in Nepal just 50 km south of Mount Everest. At Easter 2006 a group of teachers from Alex travelled to Nepal and visited Phuleli and were present at the foundation stone laying ceremony at the site of the new school. As one villager said: “We must educate our children: education is wealth.”
The prestigious Children of Ireland award was last year awarded by the president Mary McAleese to five Alex students who went to work in Calcutta to work with the Hope foundation charity,[http://www.hopefoundation.ie].
The school devotes up to five full days per school year to raising money for a range of charities decided by the student body. These 'Charity Fun Days' are entirely student-run and very successful, raising up to €4000 per day. These days are run by the Sixth Years and have themes to make them more fun for the students.
The Guild.
From its earliest days Alexandra College has had a reputation for looking outward to the community and world at large. The Guild was founded in 1897, not only to form a bond of union between past and present students and staff, and to keep them in touch with the College, but also to promote a spirit of service to the community and to undertake social and philanthropic work. The Guild has several branches worldwide and is known as a force of Alexandra alumni. Facets of the Guild include the Alexandra College Golfing Society, the Old Alexandra Hockey Club, Alexandra Guild House and the Alexandra College Bursaries, which supports 25 ladies throughout the country and assists families in need around Dublin and elsewhere.

Charlie Coffey

Charles E. "Charlie" Coffey a native of Shelbyville, Tennessee, attended the University of Tennessee to play football for General Robert Neyland. While at the University of Tennessee he played guard, lettered from 1953–55 and was selected as the team captain his senior year. Coffey also maintained the highest grade average for four years of any member of the UT squad. 
After graduating from the University of Tennessee, Coffey began his coaching career as an assistant football coach at Hialeah High School in Miami, Florida. Then he spent five years at Southeastern Louisiana State University. His next move was to George Washington University in Washington D.C., and then back to his alma mater for two years coaching for Jim McDonald and Doug Dickey. The Shelbyville, Tenn., native went on to serve as an assistant football coach at the University of Tennessee, tutoring the defensive line from 1963-65. In 1965, Coffey received an offer to join Frank Broyles’ staff at the University of Arkansas as defensive coordinator. During that time, Coffey was earning a reputation as a strong leader and an excellent football coach. After 5 years coaching at Arkansas with Broyles, three schools tried to recruit Coffey for their head coach positions. The first school he visited was Virginia Tech and in 1971 without even visiting the other schools, he became their Head Football Coach. Once he arrived in Blacksburg, Coffey established a potent passing attack, which resulted in Hokies quarterback Don Strock leading the nation in total passing and total offense in 1972. During his time in Blacksburg, he set the program awash in orange, made a whirlwind media tour of the state to promote the Virginia Tech football team and improved the athletic facilities. Most significantly, the new coach broke with Tech tradition and installed a pass-happy offense. Attendance at Virginia Tech football games increased to record breaking numbers. The highlight of the ’72 season came when Tech upset 19th-ranked Oklahoma State in Blacksburg. After completing his three-season tenure from 1971 to 1973, he had compiled a 12-20-1 record. 
Coffey then entered the trucking business in 1975, and founded Nationwide Express trucking company in 1981.

"I'm in You" is the fifth studio album by Peter Frampton, released in 1977. Frampton returned from touring in 1976 to record this album. Stevie Wonder is also featured.
Background.
Under pressure to deliver a studio follow-up to one of the biggest selling albums of the decade, Frampton faced a virtually impossible task. He came up with the album "I'm in You", recording it at Electric Lady Studios in New York, where "Frampton's Camel" had been recorded four years earlier, with Frampton demanding bodyguards to protect him from overzealous fans who were going to disrupt the recordings.
Seven million albums later, he had become a solid lightweight rocker who had set sales records and who would soon find himself welcoming Stevie Wonder, Richie Hayward, Mike Finnigan, Ringo Starr, and Mick Jagger into the studio for his follow-up album.
"I'm in You" rose to the No. 2 slot in the US on the Billboard album charts. In Canada, the album entered the chart directly at #1. The title track became his most successful single yet, and the album and same-titled single reached platinum and #2, respectively. On the Cash Box singles chart, "I'm in You" reached No. 1, as it also did in Canada.
The song "Rocky's Hot Club" was a novelty song written about Frampton's dog Rocky, who lay across his lap as he wrote the song. On the track Frampton plays harmonica and guitar, and Stevie Wonder also plays harmonica.

Infarto

Infarto (Spanish for heart attack) is a hidden camera show on Azteca 13 in Mexico and Azteca América in the United States. People appearing on the show have been subjected to pranks such as the victim believing that they will be sacrificed in a cult ritual or believing that they will be murdered by axe-wielding neighbors in the midst of a blackout. Because of the extreme and traumatizing nature of the show's content, the authenticity of the show is heavily debated. Sci-Fi Channel's original show, "Scare Tactics" is modeled after this concept.
Pop culture.
The American television show "The Soup", known for its lampooning week-in-review of celebrity and television stories, began airing short clips of "Infarto" since July 2006, mainly to mock the deep, menacing voice which utters "Infarto" when the show's title logo is displayed. This may, in part, be because "Infarto" contains the word "fart" and is therefore amusing to English-speakers. The Soup host Joel McHale has called "Infarto" "the most evil practical-joke show in the world."
Late night television show "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" aired a clip of the show featuring a knife-wielding old man.

<doc id="5972331" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5972331" title="Anglesea Power Station">
Anglesea Power Station

Anglesea Power Station is located at Anglesea, in Victoria, Australia within the floristically rich Anglesea Heath area. It is brown coal powered with one steam turbine with a capacity of 150MW of electricity, supplying almost 40% of the electricity used by the nearby Point Henry aluminium smelter, operated by Alcoa of Australia. The power station was brought online on 20 March 1969, and is supplied with coal by the adjacent open cut mine, transported to the power station along a 3 kilometre long private road. Overburden is stripped and backfilled into the mined area by earthmoving contractors using conventional power shovels and trucks.
From 1955 test bores for coal were made at Anglesea by the Roche Brothers, who were then operating a mine at nearby Wensleydale where the coal reserves were dwindling. An extensive coal deposit was found two kilometres to the north of the Anglesea township, with mining commencing in 1959 to supply brown coal to industry and institutions in the Geelong area. The mining rights were taken over by Western Mining Corporation (WMC) in 1961 to supply the power station planned by Alcoa of Australia. The Mines (Aluminum Agreement) Act of 1961 granted Alcoa a 50 year exclusive right to explore and mine over some 7,350 hectares of leasehold land in the region. After further drilling investigation WMC relocated the mining operation to the east of the original mine, closer to the power station site and providing access to a larger coal reserve of 50 million tons. The total thickness of the coal seams is about 140 metres, with total economic mineable reserves estimated at 70 million tons in the upper seam, and a further 90 million tons in lower seams. In 1992 the overburden to coal ratio averaged around 2.5 to 1, with an average coal thickness of 27 metres. 
Following negotiation with the Victorian government, Alcoa took up a 50 year extension of the Agreement under the Mines (Aluminium Agreement) Act 1961, allowing for continued operation of the mine and power station until 2016. Alcoa has outlined plans to expand the footprint of the mine by approximately 50 percent, taking the total disturbed area from approximately 400 to approximately 600 hectares, from about 2016. 
As of 2005 approximately 35 million tonnes of coal had been mined, with about 1.1 million tonnes of brown coal mined annually to feed a boiler that consumes 144 tonnes of pulverised brown coal an hour. The coal at Anglesea has a high quality heat value when compared to other brown coals used to produce electricity in Victoria, but has a much higher level of sulphur of around 3%, resulting in high levels of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions. Carbon Monitoring for Action estimates this power station emits 1.21 million tonnes of greenhouse gases each year as a result of burning coal. Anglesea draws its cooling water from six sub-artesian well bores, supplemented with rainwater.

['The most integrated setting' is one that 'enables individuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible . . . .'”
Sheltered workshops in the U.S. have become the subject of criticism for being exploitative, abusive and discriminatory. In January 2011, the National Disability Rights Network, or NDRN, issued a report entitled "Segregated and Exploited: The Failure of the Disability Service System to Provide Quality Work." The report charged that "hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities are being isolated and financially exploited by their employers."
In March 2011, a speech by Samuel R. Bagenstos, the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, cited the NDRM report in explicitly criticizing the entire concept underlying the sheltered workshop. Bagenstos took the position that the principle articulated in the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v. L.C.—which he described as "that persons with disabilities have a right to spend their lives in the most integrated setting appropriate for them as individuals" -- "is just as sensibly applied to the employment setting." He argued that "a full and equal life in the community—the ultimate goal of "Olmstead"—cannot be achieved without a meaningful, integrated way to spend the day, including integrated 'work options.'" And he stated:
individuals with disabilities spend years— indeed, decades—in congregate programs doing so-called jobs like these, yet do not learn any real vocational skills, we should not lightly conclude that it is the disability that is the problem. Rather, the programs’ failure to teach any significant, job-market-relevant skills leaves their clients stuck. As a recent review of the literature concludes, “[the ineffectiveness of sheltered workshops for helping individuals progress to competitive employment is well established.”
United Kingdom.
In the U.K., the term has been replaced with social enterprise. However, the notion of 'social enterprise' implies that the organisation would trade in the market and take on a degree of business risk, and not be completely dependent on government subsidy, as the traditional model of the sheltered workshop may allow. In this newer model, the enterprise might receive a subsidy in compensation for the reduced productivity of its disadvantaged workers, in order to allow it to compete on a "level playing field" with conventional firms.
Australia.
In Australia, funding can only be used to provide training and support to 'supported' employees. This type of employment is in contrast to 'open employment' where people with disabilities enter mainstream, competitive employment alongside people without disabilities.
In recent years, the sheltered workshop scheme was renamed Australian Disability Enterprises, but works under the same system where those with a disability earn wages equivalent to third world countries.
Individuals are paid as little as $1.79 an hour, which is based on the BSWAT. (Business Services Wage Assessment Tool). Aside from having a individual productivity measured, the hourly rate is also based on how much a person knows about occupation practices, such as Occupational Health and Safety. The scheme has been used for widespread exploitation of the handicapped. The terms of the BSWAT are open to interpretation, which in reality allows each employer to nominate an hourly rate that suits them, without any consideration of the employee.

Persian leopard

The Persian leopard ("Panthera pardus ciscaucasica" syn. "Panthera pardus saxicolor"), also called the Caucasian leopard, is the largest leopard subspecies, and is native to northern Iran, eastern Turkey, the Caucasus mountains, southern Turkmenistan, and parts of western Afghanistan. It is endangered throughout its range with fewer than 871–1,290 mature individuals and a declining population trend.
Characteristics.
The Persian leopard is large, weighing up to , and light in color. They vary in colouration; both pale and dark individuals are found in Iran.
Biometric data collected from 25 female and male individuals in various provinces of Iran indicates average body length of . A young male from northern Iran weighed .
Distribution and habitat.
Leopards were most likely distributed once over the whole Caucasus, except for steppe areas. Surveys conducted between 2001 and 2005 confirmed that there are no more leopards in the western part of the Greater Caucasus, and that they survived only at a few sites in the eastern part. The largest populations survive in Iran. The political and social changes in the former Soviet Union in 1992 caused a severe economic crisis and a weakening of formerly effective protection systems. Ranges of all wildlife were severely fragmented. The former leopard range declined enormously as leopards were persecuted and wild ungulates hunted. Inadequate baseline data and lack of monitoring programmes make it difficult to evaluate declines of mammalian prey species.
As of 2008, of the estimated 871–1,290 mature leopards
Persian leopards avoid deserts, areas with long-duration snow cover and areas that are near urban development. Their habitat consists of subalpine meadows, broadleaf forests and rugged ravines from in the Greater Caucasus, and rocky slopes, mountain steppes, and sparse juniper forests in the Lesser Caucasus and Iran. Only some small and isolated populations remain in the whole ecoregion. Suitable habitat in each range country is limited and most often situated in remote border areas. Local populations depend on immigration from source populations in the south, mainly in Iran.
In Iran.
Leopards are widely distributed in Iran, but more abundant in the northern part than in the southern part of the country.
They are present in 74 protected and non-protected areas, of which 69% are located in northern Iran. They are mainly found in the Alborz and the Zagros mountain ranges and throughout the northwestern region, which crosses these mountain chains. The Hyrcanian forests located in the north and along the Alborz mountain chain are considered as one of the most important habitats for leopards in the country. Their habitat comprises climates with temperatures ranging from to , but they are most often found in habitats with temperatures of , 0 to 20 days of ice cover per year and rainfall of more than 200 mm per year.
With more than , the Central Alborz Protected Area is one of the largest reserves in the country where leopards roam. In the Sarigol National Park in northeastern Iran, four leopard families with two cubs each were identified during a survey carried out from 2005 to 2008. A male leopard was photographed in January 2008 spraying urine on a "Berberis" tree; he was photographed several times until mid-February in the same area.
In Bamu National Park located northeast of Shiraz in Fars Province, camera trapping carried out from autumn 2007 to spring 2008 revealed seven individuals in a sampling area of .
In Armenia.
In Armenia, people and leopards co-existed since the early prehistoric times. By the mid-20th century leopards were relatively common in the country's mountains. Today, the leopard stronghold is the rugged and cliffy terrain of Khosrov State Reserve, located south-east of Yerevan on the south-western slopes of the Geghama mountains, where between October 2000 to July 2002 tracks of no more than 10 individuals were found in an area of . Leopards were known to live on the Meghri Ridge in the extreme south of Armenia, where only one individual was camera-trapped between August 2006 to April 2007, and no signs of other leopards were found during track surveys conducted over an area of . The local prey base could support 4–10 individuals, but poaching and disturbance caused by livestock breeding, gathering of edible plants and mushrooms, deforestation and human-induced wild fires are so high that they exceed the tolerance limits of leopards.
In Azerbaijan.
Leopards are present in the Talysh Mountains in the far southeast, where their habitat is continuous with that on the Iranian side of the Talysh Mountains. They also survived in northwest Azerbaijan in the Akhar-Bakhar section of Ilisu State Reserve in the foothills of the Greater Caucasus until recently, but current numbers are extremely low.
Despite occasional sightings, it was not clear whether leopards had been extinct in Azerbaijan by the late 1990s, until a specimen was camera-trapped in March 2007 in the Hirkan National Park.
In September 2012, the first picture of a leopard was taken in the Zangezur National Park, and in October, camera traps recorded one in the Hirkan National Park as well.
In March 2013, a fatal attack by a leopard on an eighteen-year-old female was reported in Hamarmeşə, near Lerik in the country's south.
In May 2013, a female leopard was recorded on a camera-trap in the Zangezur National Park displaying signs of territorial behaviour. This prompted the Azerbaijan Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources to suggest an increase in the number of leopards in Azerbaijan in recent years.
In Georgia.
Since 1954, leopards were thought to be extinct in Georgia — killed by hunters. In April 2001, an adult female was shot on the border to Kabardino-Balkaria, her two cubs captured and taken to the Novosibirsk Zoo in Russia. In the winter of 2003, zoologists found footprints of a leopard in Vashlovani Reserve in southeastern Georgia and later camera-trapped one young male individual several times. Leopard signs have also been found at two localities in Tusheti, the headwaters of the Andi Koisu and Assa rivers, bordering Dagestan.
Over the last 60 years, there have been several sightings of leopards around the Tbilisi area and in the Shida Kartli province to the northwest of the capital. Leopards live primarily in dense forests, although several have been spotted in the lowland plains in the southeastern region of Kakheti in 2004.
In the North Caucasus regions of Russia.
Signs of leopard presence have been found in the upper Andiyskoe and Avarskoye Koisu rivers in Dagestan. According to local reports leopards may also occur in Ingushetia, Ossetia and Chechnya. Leopards no longer occur in the Western Caucasus.
Ecology and behaviour.
Leopards' diet varies depending on the habitat of their territory. Their principal prey is the most abundant ungulate such as Bezoar goat, roe deer, Goitered gazelle, West Caucasian tur, mouflons, urial, and wild boar. They also prey on smaller wildlife such as Crested porcupine and Cape hare, and occasionally attack livestock and herd dogs.
Studies revealed that presence of leopards in Iran is highly correlated with presence of wild goat and wild sheep. Opportunistic predation on smaller prey species is also probable. Attack of a leopard individual on onager was also recorded.
Threats.
Persian leopards are threatened by poaching, depletion of their prey base due to poaching, human disturbance such as presence of military and training of troops in border areas, habitat loss due to deforestation, fire, agricultural expansion, overgrazing, and infrastructure development.
In Iran, primary threats are habitat disturbances followed by illegal hunting and excess of livestock in the leopard habitats. The leopards' chances for survival outside protected areas appear very slim. Intensive dry condition in wide areas of leopard habitats in recent years is affecting leopard main prey species such as wild goat and wild sheep.
Recent assessments on the Persian leopard mortality rate in Iran revealed that 70% of leopard mortalities from 2007-2011 were as a result of illegal hunting or poisoning and 18% were because of road accidents.
Conservation.
"Panthera pardus" is listed in CITES Appendix I.
In captivity.
As of December 2011, there were 112 captive Persian leopards in zoos worldwide comprising 48 male, 50 female and 5 unsexed individuals less than 12 months of age within the European Endangered Species Programme.
Recent studies have shown that these individuals are descendants of nine leopards, captured from countries in the Persian leopard's range some while ago.
Reintroduction projects.
In 2009, a Persian Leopard Breeding and Rehabilitation Centre was created in the Sochi National Park, where two male leopards from Turkmenistan are being kept since September 2009, and two females from Iran since May 2010. Their descendants are planned to be released into the wild in the Caucasus Biosphere Reserve.
In 2012, a pair of leopards was brought to the Persian Leopard Breeding and Rehabilitation Centre from Portugal's Lisbon Zoo. Two cubs were born there in July 2013. It is planned to release them into the wild after they have learned survival skills.
Taxonomic history.
The Russian explorer Satunin first described the Caucasian leopard "P.p. ciscaucasica" in 1914 on the basis of a specimen from the Kuban region of North Caucasus. The British zoologist Pocock described specimens from different areas of Persia as "P. p. saxicolor" in 1927, recognizing the similarity to "P.p. ciscaucasica". Today, these names are considered synonyms.

Watlington railway station, Oxfordshire

Watlington railway station in Oxfordshire was the terminus of the Watlington and Princes Risborough Railway and opened in 1872. Watlington station was not in Watlington itself, but in Pyrton about a mile north east from centre of Watlington.
The line was always single track. The facilities at Watlington station included a stone-built passenger building, a goods shed, and locomotive and carriage sheds.
The line was projected to be extended to Wallingford, where it would complete a cross-country line between Cholsey and Princes Risborough. Due to financial difficulties the Watlington - Wallingford section was never built.
British Railways closed the Watlington and Princes Risborough Railway to passengers in 1957 and to goods in 1961. Remains of the buildings exist, heavily overgrown, on private land.

Middletown–Town of Wallkill (Metro-North station)

The Middletown–Town of Walkill Metro-North station, often just referred to as the Middletown station, serves the residents of Middletown and Town of Wallkill in Orange County, New York. Service is to Hoboken, 71.9 miles (116 km) via the Port Jervis Line; travel time is an hour and 40 minutes. Like all Port Jervis Line stations, this station serves commuters from a wide area. Many commuters use nearby NY 17 to reach the station from communities in Sullivan County such as Wurtsboro and Monticello.
The station is located in the latter municipality, along the Erie Railroad Graham Line off NY 211 near its exit with NY 17 and not too far from the Galleria at Crystal Run, a popular local shopping mall. However, while the mall and other large retailers such as Sam's Club are visible from the station, there is no provision for pedestrian traffic on any of the roads leading to them.
Middletown Station was originally built as an Erie Railway Station along the Erie Main Line on James Street. Today the former Erie Depot is the Thrall Library.
The MTA recently concluded improvements to the station similar to those found at other Port Jervis Line stations to the east: decorative lighting, an elevated platform for access by passengers in wheelchairs, and expanded paid parking. In a switch from the other stations to receive this amenities, the platform roof at Middletown is green rather than red, platform light poles are brown instead of green and the wheelchair platform is not under the roof.
While other Metro-North stations such as Cortlandt and Southeast are named after the towns in which they are located, this is the only one to include "Town of ..." in its official name, to avoid longstanding confusion with the nearby hamlet in Ulster County.
One midday round trip originates/terminates at Middletown-Town of Wallkill on Weekdays. Train 49 departing Hoboken at 1:13 PM terminates in Middletown at 2:56 PM. Train 66 originates in Middletown at 3:25 PM, arriving Hoboken at 5:11 PM.

Port City PD

Port City PD was a podcast series that was filmed in Wilmington, North Carolina. It was composed of nine episodes and is produced by Eleven Bravo Productions,and is now been distributed and shown on Satellite TV in certain markets in the US. It has been mentioned in MovieMaker Magazine, The Reel Carolina, WWAY News Channel 3, ITworld, PodGuide.tv, Video Podcasting News, and Hubmind.net 
About Port City P.D..
PORT CITY P.D., a 24-minute, episodic police drama produced by Eleven Bravo Productions. PCPD was originally made for an internet audience, accumulating over four million downloads. 
Now, Eleven Bravo Productions has teamed up with Creative Entertainment & Media, Inc. moved the show forward to television overseas and recently to specific satellite TV markets in the US.
At the Port City Police Department, cases are funneled from first-line detectives to a dead-end detective pool when solutions are not easily found for seemingly petty cases. Despising where they are (in their lives and their careers), the once "top notch" detectives' true colors are revealed as their cases turn into something much more than vandalism and stolen property.
Completely character driven, PORT CITY P.D. is not just about the cases, but more about the everyday lives of these detectives. Each character is unique and has their own way of dealing with the commonplace stress of being part of a police department. Some handle it well, others, not so good. Because they are on the lower end of the detective unit, they must prove themselves time and time again, intelligence sometimes being their most powerful weapon. But when all else fails, it’s no holds barred.
On May 25, 2009, Port City P.D. premiered on the BSkyB (British Sky Broadcasting) Network throughout 9 million households in England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales and the Channel Islands with spillover in France, Spain and Italy. 
Port City P.D. is expected to launch in the rest of Europe within the next two months through the Global Broadcasting Company on the America Unleashed Network reaching 120 million households. Countries include: England, Germany, France, Northern Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Lichtenstein, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro as well as the United Arab Emirates.
Now, the show is heading back to the states. On January 11, 2009 Port City P.D. will air in the United States on Tuff TV, a channel broadcast in places such as Dallas, Little Rock, Wichita and Key West. It will also begin airing on AMGTV, another satellite network, on Jan. 26. If the shows goes well here, the crew will get back together to film a second season.
The show will be better than ever because technology has caught up with it. Joe Stauffer and Broken Wings Productions re-edited and color corrected the show. Nino Ninkovic and Dave Schreinner re-worked the sound design.
Producers are working to have DVDs ready by the summer or fall of next year.

Rangers (comics)

The Rangers are a superhero team published by Marvel Comics. The team first appeared in "The Incredible Hulk" #265 (November 1981) and was created by writer Bill Mantlo and penciller Sal Buscema.
Team members usually hail from Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico.
Publication history.
In the story "You Get What You Need!" published in "Incredible Hulk" vol.1 #265 (November 1981), writer Bill Mantlo and penciller Sal Buscema created the superhero team Rangers. The team consists of western characters Firebird, Shooting Star, Texas Twister, the Phantom Rider (Hamilton Slade, then called Night Rider), and the contemporary Red Wolf.
The members of the team have been identified in the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book "" #1 (June 2007). The Rangers appeared as the state superteam for Texas in the issues 2 and 19 of this series.
In 2012, writer Chris Yost chose the Texas team the Rangers to come into conflict with Houston's new superhero Scarlet Spider in the story "The Second Master" in "Scarlet Spider" #7-9. In an interview with Comic Book Resources, at a question about the antagonists in the story, Chris Yost answered "You'll also be seeing a well known super-hero group from the American southwest named -- wait for it -- The Rangers! Texas Twister! Shooting Star! Red Wolf! Living Lightning! Firebird! Even a new hero or two! And spoiler alert -- Scarlet Spider will fight them.".
Fictional team history.
The Rangers began by accident. Rick Jones was being held captive by the villainous Corruptor, who had the Hulk under his influence. Rick sent a shortwave radio message to attempt to contact the Avengers. The message never reached the Avengers, but instead five individuals intercepted the message and responded: Shooting Star and Texas Twister, Firebird, the Phantom Rider (Hamilton Slade, then called Night Rider), and the contemporary Red Wolf.
Although the five Southwestern adventurers were unable to stop the Hulk's rampage, they did enable him to defeat the Corruptor. At the battle's end, Texas Twister suggested that the five of them get together whenever a threat to the Southwest crops up. They agreed and took the collective name of the Rangers.
However, because of the geographical separation among the members, they rarely acted as a team. Additionally, Shooting Star was revealed to be possessed by a demon at the next meeting of the team and the demon had acted against the team meeting.
Shooting Star's identity was at some point taken over by an unnamed demon in the employ of Master Pandemonium, who believed Firebird to be one of the possessors of his fragmented soul. To keep the Rangers from meeting regularly and perhaps posing a threat to him before he had completed his study of Firebird, Pandemonium dispatched the demon to take Shooting Star's place. Firebird nevertheless believed the demon to be hiding among the Avengers' West Coast branch and with her guidance the Rangers confronted the heroes, only to flush the demon in Shooting Star out of hiding. The demon claimed that Shooting Star was a human guise it had taken long before, that there never was a Victoria Star. The Avengers imprisoned the demon at their Compound and began an investigation of Master Pandemonium, but the Texas Twister, demonstrating a curious lack of concern, did not accompany them.
Soon, however, Texas Twister returned to the Avengers Compound at a time when Hawkeye was alone, demanding to see the captive demon. Twister declared his love for the demon, which turned back into Shooting Star. Texas Twister went on to explain that the demon had come to him months ago when Twister's powers seemed to be fading, making him afraid that he would lose Shooting Star if their rodeo act broke up on account of his lost powers. The demon offered to augment the Twister's powers in exchange for his soul, and the Twister agreed, but after his powers were restored he begged to be spared, so the demon possessed Shooting Star instead, casting a spell that prevented Twister from telling anyone about this. Twister studied the occult until he found a means to expel the demon from Star.
The demon then possessed Twister himself and battled Hawkeye and Shooting Star. Ultimately, Star threatened to kill the demon rather than allow the possession to continue, and the demon reluctantly imprisoned itself in a statue. Texas Twister and Shooting Star were reunited.
The Rangers next appear as a team towards the end of the Civil War, in which it seems they have been reformed as the state superteam for Texas. The original five members have been joined by Armadillo, a reformed supervillain, as well as Living Lightning, a former Avenger. Armadillo later quits and joins the Hood's Crime Syndicate, though it is possible he later rejoined the team after several of the villainous members of the team were recruited to pose as heroes in Taskmaster's Initiative.
The Rangers next assist in protecting the President from HYDRA's attack. There are injuries but no fatalities.
The Rangers are seen battling a Skrull that had been impersonating Red Wolf's wolf Lobo, during the Skrull invasion. They come into conflict with Kaine alias Scarlet Spider in Houston, then they joined forces with him to battle a monster made of pure energy.

Walter Karig (1898–1956) was a prolific author, who served as a U.S. naval captain. Karig authored a number of military history works on Allied naval operations during World War II. Karig wrote scripts for the television series "Victory at Sea". Besides his works on naval history, Karig was a novelist, publishing under his own name. He also worked as a journalist.
For the Stratemeyer Syndicate, Karig wrote volumes in the Perry Pierce series (2–4), Doris Force series (3–4), and Nancy Drew series (8–10). Oddly two of the three Nancy Drew books had Helen Corning in them and Bess and George out of them.
Karig revealed to catalogers at the Library of Congress he authored three Nancy Drew volumes, numbers 8, 9, 10, under the pseudonym of Carolyn Keene. This admission angered the series' 'packager', the Stratemeyer Syndicate, who hid their ghostwriters behind syndicate-owned pen names. The publisher had no desire to reveal the true authorship of volumes in the various series. Stratemeyer's attorney threatened legal action against Karig for claiming authorship. Karig never again worked for the Stratemeyer Syndicate.
Among Karig's many novels is "Zotz!" (1947), a satirical story dealing with an archaeologist and linguist, Dr. John Jones. After deciphering an inscription on an ancient disk, Jones is imbued with deadly powers. For Jones can merely point at an animal or human, and they faint. If he utters the word "Zotz" while pointing his finger, the person or animal will die. Because the novel is set during World War II, there is a patriotic flavor to it. Also, much of the plot revolves around Jones' efforts to obtain an appointment to see President Franklin Roosevelt, with the hope that he can convince the President that the Allies can use his supernatural abilities to help the war effort. Karig has written himself into the novel as a beleaguered naval officer working at a U.S. Navy public information office, where dozens of people parade by his desk daily all trying to obtain appointments to meet with the "highest authority" in the United States government. Although Karig's novel is set the then present, he manages to point out that humans have not changed much in millennia. Technology may have improved, but humans still have a strong desire to destroy and to kill. Thus Karig manages to blend a satire on wartime Washington D.C. bureaucracy with ethical questions related to the advent of the nuclear war.
The novel's name „Zotz!“ was inspired by Karig's meeting with a member of the Zotz family:
After Karig's death, director William Castle released a movie version of "Zotz!" in 1962. The cast includes (among others) actors Tom Poston, Jim Backus, Margaret Dumont, Cecil Kellaway,
and Louis Nye. Despite the presence of these fine character actors, the movie deviates from Karig's authorial intents, and it becomes a vehicle for clever special effects – but little more.

R. v. Smith (1987)

R. v. Smith (Edward Dewey), 1 S.C.R. 1045 is a leading Supreme Court of Canada decision. The Court struck down a mandatory seven-year sentence requirement for the importation of drugs as a violation of the right against cruel and unusual punishment contrary to section 12 of the "Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms". 
Background.
Edward Smith, a twenty-seven-year-old man with multiple convictions for drug-related offences, was arriving back in Canada from Bolivia. At customs he was searched and the officers found over seven ounces of cocaine. He was convicted of importing drugs under the Narcotics Control Act and sentenced to eight years. The Act had required a minimum of sentence of seven years regardless of the amount found. The provision was challenged on the basis that it violated the "Charter".
The issue before the Supreme Court of Canada was whether the mandatory minimum sentence of seven years under section 5(2) of the Narcotics Control Act infringe section 7, 9, and 12 of the Charter. 
Opinion of the Court.
Justice Lamer, writing for the majority, held that the sentencing provision violated section 12 of the Charter. He noted that when it came to mandatory sentencing it is very important that deference be given except where it is grossly disproportionate. To assess the provision the court should consider both the gravity of the offence, the particular facts of the case, as well as the offender's personal characteristics. The characteristics are particularly important. Lamer speculated that even a young person caught bringing a single joint across the border will be subject to the sentencing provision. This, said Lamer, would subject the first time offender to cruel and unusual punishment.
On applying the section 1 test to the violation, it was found that the provision was rationally connected to the pressing objective of deterring drugs importation, but it failed to be proportional. Thus, it was struck down.
Dissent.
Justice McIntyre, on dissent, objected on a number of grounds. He did not like Lamer's speculation of the first time offender. Smith was a multiple offender and had imported enough narcotics that is was not cruel and unusual to sentence him for over seven years. The standard for cruel and unusual punishment should be based on public outrage and the degradation of the offenders dignity, none of which was found.

"Auprès de ma blonde" (French for "Next to My Girlfriend") or "Le Prisonnier de Hollande" ("The Prisoner of Holland") is a popular chanson dating to the 17th century. It appeared during or soon after the Franco-Dutch War, during the reign of Louis XIV, when French sailors and soldiers were commonly imprisoned in the Netherlands.
The song's quick pace and lively melody made it well-suited to military marches, and it is still commonly played at parades. For the same reasons, it gained widespread popularity as a drinking song and nursery rhyme.

Misumena vatia

Misumena vatia is a species of crab spider with holarctic distribution. In North America, where it is the largest and best-known flower spider, it is called the goldenrod crab spider or flower (crab) spider, because it is commonly found hunting in goldenrod sprays in the autumn.
Young males in the early summer may be quite small and easily overlooked, but females can grow up to 10 mm (excluding legs); males reach 5 mm at most.
Description.
These spiders may be yellow or white, depending on the flower in which they are hunting. Especially younger females, which may hunt on a variety of flowers such as daisies and sunflowers, may change color "at will". Older females require large amounts of relatively large prey to produce the best possible clutch of eggs. They are therefore, in North America, most commonly found in goldenrod ("Solidago sp."), a bright yellow flower which attracts large numbers of insects, especially in autumn. It is often very hard even for a searching human to recognize one of these spiders on a yellow flower. These spiders are sometimes called banana spiders because of their striking yellow color.
Reproduction.
The much smaller males scamper from flower to flower in search of females and are often seen missing one or more of their legs. This may be due either to near misses by predators such as birds or to fighting with other males.
When a male finds a female, he climbs over her head over her opisthosoma onto her underside, where he inserts his pedipalps to inseminate her.
The young reach a size of about 5 mm by autumn and spend the winter on the ground. They molt for the last time in May of the next year.
Color change.
These spiders change color by secreting a liquid yellow pigment into the outer cell layer of the body. On a white base, this pigment is transported into lower layers, so that inner glands, filled with white guanine, become visible. If the spider dwells longer on a white plant, the yellow pigment is often excreted. It will then take the spider much longer to change to yellow, because it will have to produce the yellow pigment first.
The color change is induced by visual feedback; spiders with painted eyes were found to have lost this ability.
The color change from white to yellow takes between 10 and 25 days, the reverse about six days. The yellow pigments have been identified as kynurenine and 3-hydroxykynurenine

<doc id="5972594" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5972594" title="Kevin Harris">
Kevin Harris

Kevin Harris (born August 14, 1962) is a professional skateboarder from Vancouver, British Columbia. He specializes in "freestyle" skateboarding. Harris is known for his fluid style, which incorporated complex manual variations with exceptional footwork. Stacy Peralta has called him "the most natural skater I knew." He was most active in competitions during the 1980s but is still involved with the skate scene. He owns and operates Canada's largest skateboard distribution center and continues to perform demonstrations.
Early career.
Harris was born in Richmond, British Columbia. He began skateboarding at 13 years old and like most skaters of the 1970s, he started on a mass-produced, plastic "banana" board. At first he rode all types of terrain and built what most local skaters agreed on as the best half-pipe in the Vancouver area. Even with a ramp in his backyard, he eventually focused on flatland freestyle.
Harris was first sponsored in 1977 by Nippon Cycles, a Vancouver bike and skate shop. Sponsorship meant more than discounted merchandise—wearing a Nippon team shirt was like walking around with an Olympic medal hanging off your neck. He began skating demonstrations with the "Ripping Squad," a group of Canadian skaters that rode a portable half-pipe painted with the Yin/Yang logo.
Mid career.
By 1979 Harris’ skills caught the eye of Steve Cathey, a professional skater from California. Cathey, who represented the Gordon & Smith skateboard company, offered Harris amateur sponsorship. This was particularly ironic because Harris would eventually crush Cathey's world-record for two-board “daffy” 360s. Cathey managed to rotate almost 400 times while Harris stopped spinning from exhaustion after twenty minutes and 1,032 spins later.
Underground scene and the rise to popularity.
In the early 1980s skateboarding was destitute, viewed as an embarrassing fad by non-participants. The Canadian contest circuit dried up and Harris often drove over 24 hours to California just to remain involved in competitions.
In 1982 Harris competed in the freestyle competition in Del Mar, California as a sponsored amateur. There weren't enough amateur contestants so he skated against the pros and finished in third place. Stacy Peralta, Harris' idol stopped him in the parking lot and asked him to ride for the Bones Brigade, Powell Peralta's skate team. The Brigade quickly became the most dominant team in skateboarding and Harris found himself teammates with Tony Hawk, Lance Mountain, and Rodney Mullen among others.
Harris enjoyed his greatest success as a professional during this period. Skateboarding was also becoming popular again and by 1984 a legitimate subculture had begun. In 1985, Harris placed first in Venice, California and second at Del Mar. During the preliminary round of the Del Mar competition Harris actually scored higher than Rodney Mullen, one of only two skaters to exceed Mullen's score during a contest. ("Of course, Rodney killed me in the finals," Harris said with a laugh later.) His consistently high contest results ranked him second in the world during this year.
In 1986 Powell•Peralta issued Harris' first professional skateboard model. The deck’s design featured iconic Canadian graphics: a skeletal Mountie, in front of a backdrop of maple leaves, holding a beaver by the tail. It is still considered a classic today, and original pressings are quite collectible.
Later career.
In 1985 Harris began distributing Powell Peralta skateboard products in Canada and quickly grew Ultimate Skateboards into Canada's largest skateboard distributorship. Today he co-owns Ultimate with his wife Audrey. Harris has never needed to venture outside of the skateboard industry to make a living.
In 1986 Harris took possession of the half-pipe built for the world championships held in Vancouver for Expo 86 and used it as an anchor for the Richmond Skate Ranch, an indoor skateboard facility featuring multiple ramps and wooden park features, including the "mini Chin", a complex multi-ramp structure designed by Lance Mountain. This provided Vancouver skateboarders a safe haven from the winter rains and nurtured a handful of skaters (Colin McKay, Rob Sluggo Boyce and Rick Howard among others) that continue to impact the skateboard industry. The Ranch closed in 1993 but Harris joined forces with Colin McKay and opened the RDS indoor park in 2003.
Harris' pro model was re-issued from Powell Skateboards. He lives in Ladner, British Columbia, Canada and is married and has two children Aaron and Kolby. He paid a concrete company almost $40,000 to create his ideal skating surface in his backyard and continues to skate daily with his son Kolby.
In 2007, Kevin stepped back into the competitive scene, and entered the WFSA world freestyle skateboard championships, (being held in Vancouver, Canada). His natural flow, and style had not faded over the years, and after being 'retired' for over a decade, Kevin placed 1st, claiming his very first world championship crown.

Ramna Kali Mandir

The Ramna Kali Mandir (), also known as the Ramna Kalibari (house of the Hindu Goddess Kali) was one of the most famous Hindu temples of the Indian subcontinent. It was believed to be over a thousand years old and was situated in Dhaka (the capital of present day Bangladesh) on the outskirts of the Ramna Park (now renamed as Suhrawardy Udyan).
The temple was bulldozed by the Pakistan Army on 27 March 1971 as it commenced its genocide (see: 1971 Bangladesh Genocide) during the Bangladesh Liberation War
History.
Common lore holds it that the temple was established by a Nepalese devotee of the Goddess Kali who had come to Bengal from the Himalayas. The major development of the temple occurred under the patronage of Rani Bilashmoni Debi of Bhawal estate.
The temple was one of Dhaka city's most prominent landmarks, its tower visible for miles around at a time when Dhaka had yet to embrace the highrise culture. In front of the temple was a large "dighi" (pond) which was a popular place for both worshippers and visitors to the park to take a dip and cool down. The architecture of the temple reflected the different styles the many centuries over which it was built.The tower was usually called "shikhara" which should not be confused with minerate of mosque.
Next to the temple was Ma Anandamoyee Ashram (), another place of worship with a residential complex and sanitation facility. The entire temple complex spanned almost and was situated on the south side of Ramna Park, opposite the Bangla Academy.
The Ramna Kali Mandir is clearly seen in the pictures of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's famous address of 7 March 1971, probably the last time it was photographed by mass media.
Demolition and genocide by the Pakistan Army.
On the night of March 25, 1971, the Pakistan Army, unleashed its army on the civilian population and commenced a genocide that would last nine months until liberation in December that year. It has been widely documented that one of the primary targets of the Pakistan Army and government in its military action was the Hindu population. As such, prominent Hindu targets such as Jagannath Hall (a hostel for Hindu students on the Dhaka University campus and Ramna Kali Mandir were singled out right at the onset of the Pakistani campaign.
On March 27, 1971, the Pakistan Army entered the Ramna Kali Temple complex and within the space of an hour, murdered over 100 people, almost all Hindus. Several Muslims had also sought refuge in the temple complex as the Pakistan army started going on rampage in the neighbouring areas of Dhaka University, and they were among the casualties.
Until 2000, accounts of the demolition of the temple relied largely on oral testimony by survivors and witnesses of the Pakistani Army action. However, a Public Commission was instituted by the Awami League government of Bangladesh in 2000 on the anniversary of the massacre, with the goal of documenting the events. The chairman was Justice K M Sobhan, who presented a preliminary report on September 27, 2000.
Only around 50 names of victims of the massacre have been identified; relatives of the other victims are either deceased or have left Bangladesh. An appeal has been made for any surviving relatives of victims of the Ramna Kali Mandir massacre around the world to contribute names of their kin so as to contribute to a list of martyrs on a future memorial.
Confiscation by Bangladesh Government.
A symbolic casualty of the brutal Bangladesh Liberation War, it was widely expected that the Ramna Kali Mandir would either be rebuilt completely, or left in its state of ruins as a monument to the devastation and genocide. However, the new government of Bangladesh led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, though espousing secularism and equal rights for all citizens irrespective of religion, confiscated the land of the temple from the Hindu board that had the legal ownership, and handed it over to the Department of Public Works. The government then bulldozed the last traces of the temple in 1972 and handed the land over to the Dhaka Club, an elite entertainment and social venue. The move was immediately protested in the courts by the Ramna Kali Mandir Board which still legally owned the premises, but the case was dismissed on the grounds that since the temple no longer existed, ownership was now disputed (see DAINIK BANGLA, 27 December 1972). And thus an epic and ancient Hindu landmark was lost.
Movement to rebuild and reclaim.
Since the liberation of Bangladesh in December 1971, the Hindu community has waged a continual battle to reclaim the land of the temple, worship, and rebuild. Between 1972 and 2000, Hindus were only permitted to worship once on the site, on the occasion of Kali Puja in 1982.
On the occasion of Durga Puja 2000, the Awami League government of Sheikh Hasina finally conceded the demand of Bangladeshi Hindus that had been made perennially, to allow worship again on the site of the original temple. Since then, every year, a delegation of Bangladeshi Hindus has had to formally request permission from the government, and if this is granted, a temporary "pandal" (stage) is constructed at the site of the original temple, enabling Hindus to worship, and this structure is called "Ramna Kalibari". However, as soon as the festival ends, the "pandal" has to be dismantled as per the regulations of the city authorities.
In 2004, a semi-permanent makeshift place of worship was built, and an image of the Goddess Kali was installed. It has been repeatedly alleged that visitors to the reinstated image of the Goddess Kali at the site of the original temple are harassed by the police. It is alleged that this is done with the full knowledge of local authorities to prevent the site becoming seen as a formal place of worship. Up until this point, there was nothing on the site to indicate either the history of the temple or recognition of the massacre that had taken place there in 1971.
In June 2006, the BNP government of Khaleda Zia finally announced that it would grant permission to rebuild the Ramna Kali Temple, 35 years after it was demolished, and 34 years after its remains were cleared and replaced with grass. However, the news was not universally welcomed by Bangladeshi Hindus; the Government is insisting on a relocation away from the original site on a less prominent site within the Suhrwardy Udyan; the proposed structure will also be considerably more modest than the original grand building that was truly an icon of the city. With the advent of elections and political uncertainty, it remains to be seen how the long cherished dream to rebuild the Ramna Kali Temple evolves.
Present condition in 2010.
There are now several temples in the boundary of Ramna Kali Mandir and Ma Anandamoyi Asram- Ramna Kali Mandir,Ma Durga Mandir,Radha Krisna Mandir are in almost full shape. There are some other ongoing Temples to be built e.g. Baba Loknath Temple, Ma Anandamoyi Temple, Shiva Temple, Temple of Sri Harichad Thakur etc.

Gripe water

Gripe water is a liquid given to infants with colic, gastrointestinal discomfort, teething pain, reflux and other stomach ailments. Its ingredients vary, and may include alcohol, a bicarbonate, ginger, dill, fennel and chamomile. It is typically given to an infant with a dropper in liquid form, and adults may also take gripe water for soothing intestinal pains, gas or other stomach ailments. As of 2000, there was no clinical evidence for the effectiveness of gripe water.
History.
The first "gripe water" was formulated in England in 1851 and used by English nannies. Gripe water was invented by William Woodward, an English pharmacist who did his apprenticeship in Boston, Lincolnshire, and later bought a business in Nottingham. Gripe water was adopted as a prescription by physicians. In the 1840s babies in Eastern England were afflicted by a condition known as "fen fever", and during that time there was also an outbreak of malaria in England. Woodward took his inspiration from the treatments for malaria and "fen fever". He noted that the formula used to treat fen fever was an effective "soother of fretful babies and provided relief from gastrointestinal troubles in infants." The original Woodward's Gripe Water contained 3.6% alcohol, dill oil, sodium bicarbonate, sugar, and water. Woodward registered "Gripe Water" as a trademark in 1876. It was initially marketed with the slogan "Granny told Mother and Mother told me."
In 1993, the United States Food and Drug Administration ordered an automatic detention of all shipments of Woodward's into the U.S. on the basis of its being an unapproved drug. In response to the FDA's import alert, Woodward's and other manufacturers have continued marketing the products, but as a dietary supplement.
Usage.
The formulation now varies according to the country of manufacture. In many countries, including the US, alcohol and sucrose have been replaced with other ingredients. However, sodium bicarbonate continues to be the primary active ingredient, along with the mainstays of dill and fennel oils. While evidence of gripe water's effectiveness has been limited to anecdotal accounts, there has been speculation about the reasons for the perceived effectiveness of gripe water. Its commercial success has led to imitations, including some of which that have strayed substantially from the original formulation.
Gripe water is recommended by some pediatricians and alternative practitioners as a naturopathic treatment option. It is available in the United States as an over-the-counter supplement rather than as a medicine regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. It is also available in various dietary supplement forms. Gripe water continues to be a very popular remedy for colic and other minor gastrointestinal upsets including flatulence. Many people now consider it to be a viable and preferable alternative to common medications.

She is currently married to Carlos SantaMaria (married April 9,2012). She is currently residing in Makati.
Biography.
Early life.
Rachel's mother and father separated when she was four. Her mother (Myrna Jingco) remarried (now Myrna J. Demauro) and moved to the US. Together with dad Hajji and his new partner, the late Rio Diaz, Rachel and her sister Barni spent time in Manila and the U.S.

She appeared in an Atlantis Production of Aida as Amneris in June 2011. She accepted the role of Justice in Rock of Ages in the rerun in July 2013.
Career.
Rachel Alejandro first entered the world of showbiz at the age of 12, when she was a host on the popular TV show "That's Entertainment." At 15, following her successful TV stint, Rachel recorded her first album, Just A Minute, for Alpha Records. The album spawned several hit songs including the #1 single "Mr. Kupido," as well as "K.S.P. (Kulang Sa Pansin)" and "Kay Tagal." The album went gold and Rachel's recording career was off and running. Her second album, "Watch Me Now," featured a revival of "Nakapagtataka," the signature song of her father, pop icon Hajji Alejandro. 
Rachel's powerful rendition of the song earned her the Awit Award for Best Performance by a Female Recording Artist and the Guillermo Mendoza Memorial Foundation Award for Best Female Singer/Entertainer. May Minamahal, which contained the award-winning single "Babalik-balikan", became Rachel's first platinum album in 1992. That same year, Rachel's career got another boost when she competed at the Golden Stag International Song Festival in Brasov, Romania, winning the award for Best Interpretation of a Romanian Song. Her 1994 album, Sentimental, featured the multi-awarded song "Paalam Na," which Rachel co-wrote with then-boyfriend Dingdong Avanzado.
By 1996, 22-year-old Rachel had already been in showbiz 10 years. She celebrated by releasing an anniversary album and appearing in her first major concert, with guests Janno Gibbs, Ogie Alcasid and the Street Boys. As Rachel said in an interview with Maryo B Labad, "In the past years, siguro halos lahat nasubukan ko na as far as the entertainment scene is concerned. And my efforts have paid off." Rachel's "Tanging Pangarap" album, her first for Viva Records, was released in 2001. The carrier single was written by her longtime boyfriend Lee Robin Salazar (whom Rachel has just split up with). It also contains the 2000 Metropop Song Festival winner "Forever And A Day" composed by Angelo Villegas. Recently, Rachel released a self produced album under a distribution agreement with Sony Music Philippines entitled "Believe" with original songs and cover songs from some of her stage musical projects.
Rachel has also enjoyed success as an actress, appearing in many movies and theater productions. Her last major movie was MUMBAKI with Raymart Santiago and directed by Butch Perez for VIVA Films. But she considers herself more of a singer than an actress. She is therefore looking forward to recreating her stage role of Paula in a movie version of the musical LARAWAN sometime next year.

Notre Dame High School (Toronto)

Notre Dame High School (originally St. John, Malvern High School, also known as NDHS, Notre Dame H.S., Notre Dame, or simply Dame) is an all-girls Roman Catholic secondary school in Toronto founded by the Sisters of the Congregation of Notre Dame. Notre Dame is one of 31 high schools run by the TCDSB and one of six all-girls schools, and currently has an enrollment of 682 students. The school's patron saint is Marguerite Bourgeoys.
History.
In 1941, the Congregation of Notre Dame founded Notre Dame High School to provide excellence in education for young Catholic women. Up until recently, the Sisters of the Congregation have been teaching at the school throughout its long history. The school has grown over the years such as in 1963, O’Connor Hall was built as the second building of the school; the first being the main building. In the 1970s, Notre Dame had a total of 1,111 students, and moved into the second and third floors of the neighbouring St. John Catholic School. Currently, the school uses three buildings, but only part of the third floor of St. John’s.
In 1967, the school reached an agreement with the Metropolitan Separate School Board (now the Toronto Catholic District School Board), placing the Grade 9 and 10 students would be under the publicly funded separate school system and Grades 11, 12, and 13 would continue by the Congregation. In 1984, the government started funding the last three years of high school and by 1987, Notre Dame was ceased as a private school, joining the board in the process.
Notre Dame underwent to accommodation reviews due to excessive overcrowding and its site size of 2 acres due to lack of playing field and the use of St. John's third floor. First in 2001 when the board attempted to acquire additional land for the construction of a larger school, then again in 2009 when the board attempted to relocate and/or consolidate Notre Dame with either St. Patrick or Neil McNeil with the building demolished and the school yard being expanded back to St. John. Subsequently, the board attempted to relocate the school and Neil McNeil to the closed Midland Avenue Collegiate Institute and the options were unsuccessful.
Overview.
Known for their dramatic arts, and specialities in math and science. Notre Dame is the "Sister School" of Neil McNeil located not far from Notre Dame. It is a school renowned for its elaborate and spirited school assemblies and tight knit community.
Tradition.
The most notable tradition that has been held at Notre Dame are the white dresses that are worn at the Prom. Though many senior students in the past have fought with the parent council to change, it has yet to happen. This standing tradition brings class and elegance to Notre Dame's Prom.
School song.
We sing of Notre Dame, the school we cherish. <br> 
Exalt its noble spirit, it ne'er shall perish. <br>
Raise high its duple colours, to show the glory of Notre Damian girlhood in song and story. <br>
Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Notre Dame, our hearts are yours, Your majesty and honour our love assures. <br>
Beloved Alma Mater, Our Lady's Bower. May she love you, bless you, keep you. E'er in her power.

Mind CTI

MIND CTI Ltd. is a global provider of billing and customer care solutions for voice, data, video and content services. Headquartered in Yokneam, Israel; the company also has offices in Silver Spring, MD, Reading, England and Iaşi, Romania.
History.
MIND CTI Ltd. was founded in 1995 by the company's current Chief Executive Officer Monica Iancu, née Eisinger, and Lior Salansky in Yokneam, Israel.
In August 2000 the company had an initial public offering on NASDAQ, and in 2002 the company’s shares were also listed on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange and were included in the TA-100 Index of leading shares for a while, but in Norvember of 2009, the company delisted from the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange () and now is listed exclusive with NASDAQ.
At the time of its initial public offering the company reported revenues of US$ 8.196 million and net income of US$ 1.514 million for year 1999, and had raised funding of approximately US$ 15 million from ADC Teledata Communications Ltd., a subsidiary of ADC Telecommunications, and a syndicate of investors including Summit Ventures. The initial public offering yielded net proceeds of US$ 29.9 million for the company, and in 2001 the company reported revenues of US$ 15.613 million, net income of US$ 3.748 million, and working capital of US$ 46.6 million as of December 31, 2000.
In 2001, the company acquired from Veramark Technologies Inc. all the rights for the VeraBill product line, a mediation, provisioning and billing solution for wireline and wireless mid-size carriers, for US$ 1 million.
In 2005 the company acquired Sentori Inc., a provider of customer care and billing solutions to rural wireless carriers and MVNOs, mainly in the United States, for an estimated US$ 4.426 million in cash, noting that the transaction carried a goodwill of US$ 6.966 million, intangible assets of US$ 1.871 million, and current liabilities of US$ 5.062 million. 
In 2007, the company acquired Omni Consulting Company Limited (doing business as "Abacus Billing,") a provider of billing and customer care solutions in a service bureau mode, mainly in Europe, for an estimated US$ 5.972 million in cash (including expenses) and performance related earn-outs providing for payments through the third quarter of 2009 of up to a maximum of approximately US$ 1.5 million, noting that the transaction carried goodwill of US$ 3.339 million (not including goodwill from the performance related earn-outs,) intangible assets of US$ 1.577 million, and current liabilities of US$ 1.159 million.
From 2007 through 2009, the company encountered difficulties with the investment of a large part of its assets in auction rate securities, causing write-offs of significant investments from 2007 through 2009. However, these write-off were eventually offset through the settlement of an arbitration action against Credit Suisse Group AG. Aggravating the difficulties with the investments, during the 2007 through 2009 time-period, the company experienced difficulties growing, recording no net-new business in 2008.
Subsequent to the 2009 settlement agreement with Credit Suisse Group AG, the company was sued by an individual investor, purportedly in a class action securities lawsuit, relating primarily to the Company's investment in auction rate securities. The lawsuit was dismissed in July 2010.
In 2010, the company resumed its growth, securing new key wins, including wins with tier 1 operators and wins related to the deregulation and emerging MVNO market in Israel.
In 2013, the company announced that it would actively pursue acquisitions that satisfied certain criteria, including proven revenue generation, complementary technology and geography and expected accretion to earnings within two to three quarters.
Auction Rate Securities.
In the years prior to 2009, MIND CTI Ltd. had US$ 22.8 million, almost two-thirds of its, then, current assets, tied up in collateralized debt obligation (CDO) bond investments issued by Merrill Lynch and structured as auction rate securities (ARSs), which were subsequently written down in their entirety. In September 2009 the company recovered US$ 18.5 million of the failed investment in an arbitrated settlement with Credit Suisse Group AG, its financial adviser, and, subsequently, in December 2009, the company paid out an extraordinary dividend of US$ 0.80 per share to its shareholders. In its Statement of Claim, filed on February 20, 2008, with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority against Credit Suisse, its investment bank, and certain Credit Suisse employees, the company alleged, among other things, "that the bank was supposed to invest company's funds in highly liquid, highly safe, 28-day auction rate securities, but - without company's authorization - invested the funds ... in a security called 'Mantoloking '" and sought recovery of US$ 22.8 million. The arbitration action was related to United States vs. Butler, an indictment of two Credit Suisse bankers, Julian Tzolov and Eric Butler, for, among other things, securities and wire fraud, alleging that Tzolov and Butler represented investments in CDO-ARSs as low risk products, guaranteed by the United
States government and concealed or falsified the names of the investments to make it appear that these products were other types of ARSs than CDO-ARSs by removing the term "CDO" from the name of the investment, adding the term "student loan" or "SL," or doing both (Tzolov pleaded guilty to in July 2009 and Butler was convicted in August 2009). As part of the arbitration settlement, the company was also reimbursed for US$ 0.4 million of its legal costs related to the arbitration.
During 2009 Sarit Tamar, an individual shareholder in the company, filed a purported class action securities lawsuit against the company, certain of the company's officers, and one of the company's directors. The complaint sought unspecified compensatory damages for, among other things, alleged misleading statements relating primarily to the Company's investment in auction rate securities. Federman and Sherwood (federmanlaw.publishpath.com) represented the plaintiff and Troutman Sanders represented the company. The company defended itself against the suit, and in July 2010 the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a decision, dismissing the complaint against all defendants without leave to amend. In the order dismissing the lawsuit, the Court noted that plaintiff had failed to establish a strong inference of scienter and failed to plead facts showing a primary violation of the securities laws.
On or about December 2011, the company brought suit against Kesselmann and Kesselmann, a PricewaterhouseCoopers firm and the company's accountant during the period that the company invested in auction rate securities, alleging breach of contract, negligence, and breach of fiduciary duty in relation to the company's investment in the auction rate securities. The lawsuit seeks compensation equal to the difference between the compensation it received from Credit Suise Group AG and the approximately US$ 20 million written off (for a total of US$ $1.8 million,) the cost of defending itself the purported class-action suit filed against it in relation to the auction rate securities matter, and the loss of return, economic activity, and goodwill resulting from Kesselmann and Kesselmann's actions.
Share Buy-back.
In September 2008, the company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the repurchase of up to 2.1 million of the company’s shares, in an amount of up to US$ 2.8 million. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had repurchased 2.1 million shares at a total purchase price of approximately US$ 1.6 million.
In February 2009, the Board of Directors authorized additional repurchases of the company’s shares in the total amount of US$ 1.2 million pursuant to the 2008 repurchase plan. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had purchased an aggregate amount of 3,165,092 shares at a total purchase price of US$ 2.8 million.
In November 2009, the Board of Directors authorized a new plan for the repurchase of the company’s shares, in an amount in cash of up to US$ 1.8 million. As of December 31, 2011, no repurchases had been made under this new plan and it became non-active.
In August 2012, the company authorized the re-activation of the 2009 plan allowing for the repurchase of the company's ordinary shares in the open market in an amount in cash of up to $1.8 million.
Dividend.
For a technology company, MIND CTI Ltd has an unusual dividend policy in that it, based on certain approvals by its Board of Directors and, in some special situations, the Courts of Israel, pays out ordinary dividends amounting to approximately the company's net income for the previous year. From 2003 the company has issued both ordinary dividends under this policy and extraordinary dividends:
Dividends paid to the company's shareholders in 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was US$ 4.5 million, US$ 6.0 million, US$ 3.7 million, and US$ 14.8 million, respectively.
Products.
MIND CTI products include:
Customers.
The company’s customers include communication providers as well as new service providers in over 40 countries across the globe, including CellCom, EastLink, Romtelecom, Moldtelecom, China Unicom, H3G Italy, Intelco International Telecommunications, Telefónica Del Peru, SingTel, Sri Lanka Telecom, and Verizon.
Historically, the company's OSS/BSS business has targeted tier 2 and tier 3 wireless, wireline, ISP, and cable operators. Lately, however, the company has won deals with tier 1 operators and has won significant MVNO and MVNE centric deals in Israel, and in February 2011, the company announced plans to significantly increase the company's employee base in the first half of 2012 to support new projects and the multiple requests of engineering resources it had received from its growing customer base.

Top attack

A top attack device is designed to attack armoured vehicles from above, as the armour is usually thinnest at the top. Ideally, it will penetrate perpendicular to the attacked surface. The device may be delivered (often as a submunition) by a missile, artillery shell, or even an emplaced munition. Top attack munitions use either a high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead for direct impact or near impact, or an explosively formed penetrator (EFP) warhead for over-flight of the target.

Cadboro Bay

Cadboro Bay is a neighbourhood and bay located on southern Vancouver Island in the Canadian province of British Columbia, located in the Municipality of Saanich and the Municipality of Oak Bay. Cadboro Bay was a village of the Songhees coast Salish peoples and was called Sungayka.
Cadboro Bay is a neighbourhood nestled between the University of Victoria uphill to the west and some of the most expensive neighbourhoods in Greater Victoria on the other sides: the Uplands district to the south, Ten Mile Point to the east and the Queenswood neighbourhood, with its multi-million dollar, secluded homes to the north. The heart of Cadboro Bay is its English style village shopping area. One of the main attractions of Cadboro Bay is its curving, sandy beach. The beach lines the shoreline of the body of water which bears the name "Cadboro Bay". The long sand beach was used by Salish for Lacross.
At the foot of Sinclair Road is the Cadboro-Gyro Park with a concrete octopus, whale, tugboat and a replica of the sea monster, Cadborosaurus. The body of water named Cadboro Bay is the home of the Cadborosaurus, nicknamed Caddy, a mythical sea monster that has supposedly been spotted in the calm waters of the bay. Cadboro Bay gets its name from the first Hudson's Bay Company sailing vessel brought to the BC Coast, the "Cadboro", which was the first vessel to anchor in the bay at Sungayka .
The Royal Victoria Yacht Club is located in Cadboro Bay on the Oak Bay side.

Synsacrum

The synsacrum is a skeletal structure of birds and dinosaurs, in which the sacrum is extended by incorporation of additional fused or partially fused caudal or lumbar vertebrae. The innominate bones are fused with the synsacrum to a greater or lesser extent, according to species, forming an avian pelvis. This forms a more extensive rigid structure than the pelvis of a mammal, fulfilling requirements for flight, locomotion and respiration. Posterior to the synsacrum there are a few free caudal vertebrae, the last of which is the pygostyle to which the long, stiff tail feathers are attached. The central section of the synsacrum is swollen to accommodate the glycogen body, an organ whose function is as yet unclear but which may be associated with balance.
In terms of external morphology, the synsacrum corresponds to the rump.

Harmony Company

The Harmony Company was an American company that, in its heyday, was the largest musical instrument manufacturer in the USA. They made many types of stringed instruments, including ukuleles, acoustic and electric guitars, and violins.
History.
Harmony was founded in 1892 by Wilhelm Schultz. In 1916, Sears, Roebuck and Co. purchased it, in part to corner the ukulele market. At the time Harmony was led by Joe Kraus, who was chairman until 1940. In 1928, Harmony introduced the first of many Roy Smeck models, and went on to become the largest producer in the U.S. They sold 250,000 pieces in 1923 and 500,000 in 1930, including various models of guitars, banjos, and mandolins.
In the late 1930s, the firm began making violins again after a 19 year hiatus. They also bought brand names from the bankrupt Oscar Schmidt Co.—La Scala, Stella, and Sovereign. They sold not only Harmony products, but instruments under the Sears name, Silvertone, and a variety of trade names—Vogue, Valencia, Johnny Marvin, Monterey, Stella, and others. In 1940, after Kraus had a conflict with management, he left, but then bought enough stock to restart the company independently.
The company peaked in 1964-1965, selling 350,000 instruments, but low-end foreign competition led to the company's demise 10 years later. Between 1945 and 1975, the Chicago firm mass-produced about ten million guitars. The company reduced their output over the years, later focusing on student models sold through JCPenney.
The pickups on almost all electric guitars and basses that Harmony produced were manufactured by Rowe Industries Inc./H. N. Rowe & Company/Rowe DeArmond Inc./DeArmond In. in Toledo, Ohio.
The Harmony Guitar Company ceased in 1975,"In 1975 the Harmony Guitar Co. in Chicago ceased operations and had a huge three day auction."</ref> and sold the Harmony name. In the early 2000s, an unrelated company, the Westheimer Corp., based in Lake Barrington, Illinois briefly imported "reissue" Harmony guitars.

History.
Established in 1997, Touro University California was originally located in San Francisco with its inaugural class composed of 67 students. In 1999, Touro University California officials decided to relocate to the southern area of Mare Island due to its large capacity and restored two buildings formerly used as naval quarters originally built in the 1930s and had the lease option to renovate ten other buildings intended to become diagnostic and research laboratories. Touro University California's main buildings are Farragut Inn, named in honor of Commander David G. Farragut, Wilderman Hall in honor of Commander Alvin Wilderman, and Lander Hall named in honor of Dr. Bernard Lander, the founder of the Touro College system. Touro University California's College of Osteopathic Medicine became the second osteopathic medical program to open in the state of California after Western University of Health Sciences' College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific received accreditation in 1982.

Lynn Willis

Lynn Willis (died January 18, 2013) was a wargame and role-playing game designer, best known for his work with Metagaming Concepts, Game Designers' Workshop, and Chaosium.
Biography.
Willis began by designing science fiction wargames for Metagaming Concepts, starting with "Godsfire" in 1976. He designed the microgames "Olympica" (1978) and "Holy War" (1979). Chaosium published "Lords of the Middle Sea" (1978), and Willis joined Chaosium in 1978. GDW published "Bloodtree Rebellion" (1979). Willis's relationship with Chaosium proved the most enduring; he would turn to role-playing games. He helped founder Greg Stafford trim and refine the "RuneQuest" rules into "Basic Role-Playing", the rules that would serve as the base for many of Chaosium's RPG lines. He wrote the "Call of Cthulhu" campaign "The Masks of Nyarlathotep" (1984) with Larry DiTillio. He was included in the design credits for "Worlds of Wonder" (1982) and the "Ringworld" RPG (1984).
With other members of Chaosium, he co-wrote the "Ghostbusters" RPG for West End Games, which won the H.G. Wells Award for Best Role-playing Rules of 1986. Willis co-designed the fifth edition of "Call of Cthulhu" with Sandy Petersen, and replaced Keith Herber as line editor of "Cthulhu" when Herber left Chaosium in 1994. Willis created the game "Elric!" with Richard Watts as a new "Basic Role-Playing" version of "Stormbringer". After Greg Stafford left Chaosium in 1998, Willis stayed on as editor-in-chief.
Willis left Chaosium in late 2008 due to health issues; at the time, he was the most long-serving Chaosium employee, with 30 years of experience with the company.
Death.
On September 11, 2008, the President of Chaosium Inc., Charlie Krank informed the public that Willis had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Krank reported that Willis died on January 18, 2013.

<doc id="5972812" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5972812" title="Coronation Drive, Brisbane">
Coronation Drive, Brisbane

Coronation Drive, popularly known as Coro Drive, is a road in Brisbane, Queensland which connects the Central Business District to the suburb of Toowong. It follows the Brisbane River from the Riverside Expressway, through the suburbs of Milton and Auchenflower, until it terminates in Toowong at Benson Road and High Street.
Coronation Drive is six lanes wide for the majority of its length, with the Bicentennial Bike Path also for pedestrian and bicycle traffic.
History.
Coronation Drive started out as a rough track that developed along the river during the 1840s. It was initially called Moggill Road (because it was the road to Moggill), then later (1870s) it became known as the River Road. In 1937 the River Road was renamed Coronation Drive in honour of the coronation of King George VI, a suggestion made by Archbishop James Duhig. On 13 May 1937, the Governor of Queensland Sir Leslie Wilson planted a small bunya tree on North Quay, Brisbane to mark the name change. Brisbane Lord Mayor John Beals Chandler undertook the improvement and beautification of the road in order to fulfill his vision of a gracious city. 
Coronation Drive developed as the major transport route for the western suburbs along with Milton Road. A landslide caused by flood waters in 1974 closed Coronation Drive due to cracking and subsidance. The flood caused the redirection of Coronation Drive so that traffic inbound to Brisbane City turned left at the Sylvan Road intersection, and then right down Land Street. 
In 2004 Coronation Drive was completely redeveloped into its current day form, with the redirection removed and widening to allow 6 lanes of traffic. Former Lord Mayor Jim Soorley inaugurated a series of "tidal flow" traffic lights in both directions, as well as a dedicated bus lane, in order to ease congestion along the road. Upon the election of Campbell Newman, the bus lanes were changed to T3 Transit Lanes with three occupants required. In March 2007 the T3 transit lane restrictions were removed after Campbell Newman requested the change based on analysis showing that only 5% of vehicles actually use the T3 lane. The Labor opposition did not block the change.
In September 2008, the Council announced a decision to scrap the Tidal Flow System after conceding it as a failure. This decision was influenced by the construction of the Hale Street Bridge and also the maintenance cost of the system, amounting to $600,000 each year, with a further $7 million in repairs. Instead, 3 permanent lanes will be inbound to the city and 2 lanes outbound. Statistics show that more traffic travels inbound than outbound at both morning and afternoon peak hours. One of the inbound lanes will be made into a T2 lane once the Hale Street Bridge project is well developed.
Tidal Flow System.
The Coronation Drive Tidal Flow System was implemented to improve traffic flow along the routinely congested road. It consists of overhead gantries displaying white arrows or red crosses to indicate which lanes can be driven in, LED signs on approach that indicate current lanes open, LED catseye markers embedded in the road that are turned on and off to move the median line and boom gates that swing into the lanes when closed to stop use of the closed lane. 
The Tidal Flow System was heavily criticised by the public for a number of reasons. These included the perception that the lane system was confusing and caused road accidents, especially when drivers were required to make turns on or off the tidal flow system. Lights in the road meant to guide drivers were often broken and during daylight hours were hard to discern. In particular, the right hand turn from Coronation Drive onto Lang Street (outbound) has two lanes and drivers were routinely confused as to which lane on Lang street they should turn into. 
The Tidal Flow System was well over budget, with the cost of the system far higher than originally planned. The system was prone to vandalism, in particular the boom gates used to block off lanes were routinely hit by vehicles. Critics claim that the tidal flow system has not been effective in improving traffic flow. The primary reason given is due to traffic in both directions being high at peak hour due to the University of Queensland bound traffic balancing the city bound traffic. The tidal flow system did not close lanes due to traffic accidents or roadworks, instead, traditional vehicles and signage were used, leaving a much touted feature of the system unutilised. Out of state or overseas drivers tended to not understand the system and its dynamic lanes, thus were likely to end up driving in T3/Bus lanes or not merging when they should.
The Tidal Flow System was dismantled and removed at the end of 2008 after a decision by the Brisbane City Council. A similar system is operated on the Houghton Highway across Bramble Bay at Redcliffe until the opening of the Ted Smout Memorial Bridge in 2011.

Husbandman

A husbandman in England in the medieval and early modern period was a free tenant farmer or small landowner. The social status of a husbandman was below that of a yeoman. The meaning of "husband" in this term is "master of house" rather than "married man".
The earliest recorded use of the term dates from the Hebrew bible in the Book of Genesis 9:20: "And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard".
Origin and etymology.
The term "husband" refers to Middle English "huseband", from Old English "hūsbōnda", from Old Norse "hūsbōndi" ("hūs", "house" + "bōndi", "būandi", present participle of "būa", "to dwell", so, etymologically, "a householder").

Broadpoint

BroadPoint Communications was a US telecommunications company in the late 1990s offering free long-distance calling supported by advertising, a service the company called "Sponsored Communications." Perry Kamel was founder and CEO of the company, based in Landover, Maryland. Users would sign up online for the company's FreeWay service by filling out a questionnaire. To make calls, users dialed the BroadPoint toll-free number, then entered their PIN, followed by the desired number. Users could then earn minutes of calling time by listening to brief advertisements, five to fifteen seconds in length, targeted to their interests and location. GEICO was a frequent advertiser. However, the minutes earned could not be carried over to another call, so users would sometimes accrue many minutes of free calling, only to lose them when their intended party was busy or did not answer. Perhaps because of such shortcomings, the FreeWay service soon ended. The company filed for Chapter 7 liquidation in January 2002. Broadpoint's former URL is no longer associated with the company, and is now made up only of advertising links. Kamel is now COO of Maxamine, a Web analysis company.
A similar service in Sweden, GratisTel, interrupted calls periodically for advertising, and was similarly short-lived.

Dry County (song)

"Dry County" is a song by Bon Jovi from their 1992 album "Keep the Faith". It was written by Jon Bon Jovi. "Dry County" stands as the band's longest song released so far, with a length of 9 minutes 52 seconds. A shorter 6-minute version reached #9 in the UK Charts and #1 in Latin America.
Lyrical interpretation.
"Dry County" is about the decline of the US domestic oil industry and its effect on those whose income relied on it. In live versions of the song, during the build up to the second guitar solo, Jon Bon Jovi often includes a monologue about the struggles of life generally.
Song structure.
"Dry County" is an epic ballad that contains several rises, climaxes, and instrumental solos, in the vein of such long rock epics as "Free Bird", "Child in Time", "Stairway to Heaven", "Telegraph Road", "I Want You (She's So Heavy)", and "Jungleland".
Live Performances.
Although "Dry County" is considered a fan favorite, it was only played regularly on the Keep the Faith Tour. On May 13, 2006, Bon Jovi played "Dry County" live at the first concert of the summer leg of their Have A Nice Day Tour in Düsseldorf, it was the first time it had been played live in 10 years, and went on to be performed on further occasions on that tour and on the band's more recent Lost Highway Tour.

Energy Brix Power Station

Energy Brix Power Station is a brown coal powered power station located at Morwell, in Victoria, Australia. The power station is used to supply electricity for the retail market, as well as the production of briquettes in the adjacent Energy Brix briquette works.
History.
Work on the power station and briquette works commenced in 1949 by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV), when field works on the Morwell open cut mine commenced, and briquette production equipment was ordered from Germany. It was originally known as the Morwell Power Station. Production at the plant started in 1956, with the briquettes produced used for domestic and industrial use, as well as town gas production for Melbourne at an adjacent gasworks by the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria.
Privatisation.
The power station and briquette works were split from the SECV in November 1993, when former Morwell Briquette and Power division was established as a Government Business Enterprise named Energy Brix Australia. At the time of the split, the plant employed 370 people, and exported 80,000 tonnes of briquettes to Germany, Slovenia, Korea, Japan, New Zealand and Cyprus. Energy Brix Australia was sold on 4 August 1996. In February 2006 a licence was granted to the company for the retail sale of electricity from its plant.
Heat is reclaimed from the steam produced by electricity generation, and used to dry brown coal from up to 65% moisture down to 10% for use in coal briquettes manufactured on the site for both domestic consumption and export. The Energy Brix power station has five steam turbines with a combined generation capacity of 170 MW. The power station sources raw brown coal for briquette production from the Yallourn and Loy Yang open cut mines, and its steaming coal for power generation from the Morwell open cut mine.
Carbon Monitoring for Action estimates this power station emits 1.31 million tonnes of greenhouse gases each year as a result of burning coal. The Australian Government has announced the introduction of a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme commencing in 2010 to help combat climate change. It is expected to impact on emissions from power stations. The [http://www.npi.gov.au/index.html National Pollutant Inventory provides details of other pollutant emissions, but, as at 23 November 2008, not CO2.

Meneely Bell Foundry

The Meneely Bell Foundry was a bell foundry established in 1826 in West Troy (now Watervliet), New York, by Andrew Meneely, a former apprentice in the foundry of Benjamin Hanks. Two of Andrew's sons continued to operate the foundry after his death, while a third son, Clinton H. Meneely, opened a second foundry across the river with George H. Kimberly in Troy, New York in 1870. Initially named the Meneely Bell Company of Troy, this second foundry was reorganized in 1880 as the Clinton H. Meneely Company, then again as the Meneely Bell Company. Together, the two foundries produced about 65,000 bells before they closed in 1952.
Bell locations.
Below is a sample of locations where Meneely Bell Foundry bells can be seen and heard:
St Peter's Episcopal Church, Tunkhannock, PA, USA
Below is a sample of locations where bells from the second Meneely bell foundry can be seen and heard:
Columbian Liberty Bell.
The Columbian Liberty Bell was cast by Clinton H. Meneely's foundry for display at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. The bell disappeared while on tour in Europe.
Saint Anthony’s Church Bell, Prague, Czech Republic.
The Meneely bell that hangs in St Anthony's Church in Prague was purchased by the Mid-European Union in October 1918 to commemorate the independence of Czechoslovakia after World War I and donated to the group's president, Thomas Masaryk, who became the head of the country's provisional government and, in 1920, the Czechoslovak president. The bell cost $2,000 and weighed 2,542 pounds (1,155 kg).

<doc id="5972928" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5972928" title="New York v. Ferber">
New York v. Ferber

New York v. Ferber, , is a precedential decision given by the United States Supreme Court. In the case of New York v. Ferber, the Court ruled unanimously that the First Amendment right to free speech did not forbid states from banning the sale of material depicting children engaged in sexual activity.
Procedural Background.
New York had an obscenity law that made it illegal for an individual to "promote[] any performance which includes sexual conduct by a child less than sixteen years of age." Paul Ferber, an owner of an adult bookstore in Manhattan, was charged under the law after he sold an undercover police officer two films depicting young boys masturbating. He was charged with promoting both obscene sexual performances and indecent sexual performances. At trial, he was acquitted of the obscene sexual performance count but he was convicted of the indecent sexual performance count, and the conviction was affirmed by the intermediate appellate court. The New York Court of Appeals reversed the conviction, finding the obscenity law unconstitutional under the First Amendment because the law was both underinclusive as to other films of dangerous activity, and overbroad as to its application to materials produced out-of-state and non-obscene materials. The State of New York asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case.
The Court's Decision.
The Court upheld the constitutionality of New York's obscenity law, ruling that it did not violate the First Amendment, and reversed and remanded the case.
For a long time before the decision, the Court had ruled that the First Amendment allowed the regulation of obscenity. Under the Court's previous decision in "Miller v. California", , material is "obscene" if, taken as a whole and applying contemporary community standards, it lacks serious scientific, literary, artistic, or political value, is "patently offensive" and aimed at "prurient interests". The court in "Ferber" found that child pornography, however, may be banned without first being deemed obscene under "Miller" for five reasons:

Cheng Kung-class frigate

The "Cheng Kung" class frigates are based upon the U.S. "Oliver Hazard Perry" class and are currently serving in the Republic of China (Taiwan) Navy (ROCN). The frigates were produced under license by China Shipbuilding Corporation in Kaohsiung, Taiwan throughout the 1990s as part of the "Kuang Hua 1" Patrol Frigate, Guided project and served as the mainstay of the ROCN's theater air defense prior to the ROCN's acquisition of "Keelung" ("Kidd") class destroyers in 2005.
In order to control new weapon systems on the frigate, which Mk 92 can't integrate at the time, a second CDS, H930 MCS was installed in order to control the 8 HF-2 (or four HF-2 and four HF-3 on certain ships) and the two Bofors 40mm/L70 guns. But Mk 92's Harpoon mode was deleted due to US government refused to sell Harpoon to Taiwan at the time. Also deleted were some of Mk 92's ASW modes, plus refusing to sell SQR-19 Towed Array sonar system.
Originally only two lead ships were going to be built to this standard, the rest of the six ships in the class were going to be built under ACS (Advance Combat System) project with a lighter AEGIS (that later became SPY-1F), 48-64 cell Mark 41 Vertical Launch System and other systems, and a 15-meter plug-in section. Delay in design and budget changed the project to four ships in PFG-1101 configuration and last 4 ships in ACS configuration, then more delays changed to 6+2, then 7+1. By mid 1990s, ROCN decided ACS project was too risky, too long and too over budget, finally canceling it after the 7th ship was built to the PFG-1101 standard. However, enough of the long lead items were already purchased that in late 2000 ROCN decided to go ahead with the 8th ship's construction with PFG-1101 configuration—minus the two Bofors 40mm/L70 guns, after getting necessary funding.
Upgrades.
The "Cheng Kung" class was initially fitted with 8 × Hsiung Feng II ship-to-ship missiles, instead of the Harpoon missiles that the "Oliver Hazard Perry" class use. In 2001, ROCS "Cheng Kung" (成功, PFG-1101) was refitted with four Hsiung Feng III missiles, replacing four of the Hsiung Feng II missiles. In 2009 ROCS "Chi Kuang" (繼光, PFG-1105) was seen with same configuration. All the other ships in the class will received the new missile upon their major overhaul. 
Originally, all HF-2 missiles were to be removed, while 4-8 Harpoon to be carried in Mk 13 launcher's magazine (with necessary upgrade to the ship's Mk 92 CDS which had Harpoon control mode and functionality deleted when ship was built), and 8 HF-3 supersonic AShM to put in place of 8 HF-2 AShM, giving these ships total of 12-16 anti-ship missiles. But the Legislative Yuan stopped the ROCN from buying Harpoon missiles from US for this upgrade, and ROCN had to settle for just 4 HF-2 and 4 HF-3 configuration. Also all ships being installed with Link 16 datalink. 
From 2014 on, Standard Missile system will gradually be replaced by Sky Bow missile system.

Rick Famuyiwa

Rick Famuyiwa, born on June 18, 1973, is an emerging Nigerian American Hollywood writer and director of films such as "The Wood" (1999), "Talk To Me" (2007), and "Brown Sugar" (2002). His most recent film is the
comedy "Our Family Wedding" (2010), starring Forest Whitaker and America Ferrera. Famuyiwa’s films mainly explore themes of racial diversity and acceptance of oneself and others, especially within communities of color. In the majority of Famuyiwa’s films, friendship plays a central role to the characters’ development and progression throughout the film. Additionally, thus far, nearly all of Famuyiwa’s feature films have dealt with the institution of marriage in one form or another. It is helpful to note also that Rick Famuyiwa’s upbringing in the racially eclectic Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood has had a tremendous impact on his cinematic works and point of view as both an individual and artist.
Famuyiwa is a graduate of the University of Southern California (USC) and has Bachelor of Arts degrees in Cinematic Arts Film & Television Production and Cinematic Arts Critical Studies, both granted by the USC College of Letters, Arts & Sciences in conjunction with the School of Cinematic Arts. Rick Famuyiwa is part of the Director’s Guild of America and it is his passion to make African Americans a greater, more respected part of the cinema industry.
Background.
Rick Famuyiwa grew up in the southwestern Los Angeles, California suburb of Inglewood. Son of Nigerian immigrants, Famuyiwa is a first-generation Nigerian American. Reflecting on his time growing up in Inglewood, Famuyiwa recounts, “The thing you gotta understand about L.A. is that everything is suburbia. Los Angeles isn't set up like San Francisco or New York. People come to L.A. and they expect to see a ghetto like the projects, but that's not the way it's set up. Inglewood, in particular, is the furthest thing from a ghetto. It's a middle-class community, but it's gotten a bad rap over the years...because of "Grand Canyon" and "Pulp Fiction" and other films.” Influenced by his upbringing in a heavily African American and Latino community, Famuyiwa’s films explore key themes of racial diversity and acceptance of oneself and others. Famuyiwa continues about his hometown, “I would be lying if I said there isn't a negative element in the city, but I would say it's no different than any other city. You come across gangs and you come across negative things -- but it's like everywhere else, if that's what you gravitate toward and that's what you want to do, you're gonna find trouble no matter what you do. But we were never into that. My group of friends were never into that.” Ultimately, Famuyiwa’s upbringing in the racially eclectic Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood would have tremendous impact on his later cinematic works and point of view as both an individual and artist.
After high school, Famuyiwa attended the University of Southern California (USC) and double majored in Cinematic Arts Film & Television Production and Cinematic Arts Critical Studies. During his time at the University, Famuyiwa worked intimately with film professor Todd Boyd, who would later help write and produce his first feature film. In 1996, prior to graduation, Famuyiwa created a 12-minute short film entitled "Blacktop Lingo" that garnered critical positive feedback and led to his invitation to the Sundance Filmmaker’s Institute. In 1997, during his time at the Sundance Director’s Lab, Famuyiwa perfected his craft and put the finishing touches on "The Wood", what would later be his first feature film. In 1999, Famuyiwa married his wife Glenita Mosley whom he met at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Major Films.
"The Wood" (1999).
Rick Famuyiwa’s first feature film was a semi-autobiographical account of his upbringing in Inglewood. Working at the Beverley Hills Niketown while formulating the script, Famuyiwa wanted his first film to be reminiscent of what he knew best--his family and his friends. Famuyiwa and his family had moved to Inglewood while he was in junior high and "The Wood", which Famuyiwa wrote and directed, reflects select experiences he had with his close friends and family.
During his time at the Sundance Director’s Lab, Famuyiwa perfected the film’s script and identified close to half of the cast, Omar Epps and Taye Diggs included. The predominantly African American cast was composed of then up and coming actors of the time. The cast ultimately included Omar Epps, Taye Diggs, Richard Jones, and Tamala Jones among others.
In the film, the characters played by Omar Epps and Richard Jones struggle to bring Taye Diggs’ character back to consciousness after he unexpectedly becomes intoxicated a couple hours before his own wedding. While attempting to sober him up and bring him back to reality, the three friends from junior high reminisce on their times as adolescents in “the Wood,” an affectionate abbreviation for their hometown of Inglewood.
"The Wood" is based loosely on the real-life experiences of Famuyiwa and his best friend Oakland firefighter Geoffrey Blackshire. Commenting on the film, Famuyiwa states, “It's not a complete autobiography of me. I mean, kind of a small portion of it is real and I just made that up bigger. It's definitely based on me and my best friend.”
It was not easy for Famuyiwa to make "The Wood" a reality, especially when it came time to share his work with the world. Being a first time feature film director, the finding of a production company that would back up his work and support his dream was not something to be taken lightly or easily come by. Historian Melvin Burke Donalson asserts, “The overall history of narrow screen images of blacks resulted directly from the lack of decision-making power behind the camera. In both the creative and business aspects of filmmaking, blacks have traditionally had a minimal involvement as studio executives. In the motion picture business, which thrives on closed social networks, family affiliations, and venture capital, Hollywood powerbrokers have easily excluded blacks from the inner circles of creative development, financial planning, production, and distribution. Consequently, to those Hollywood powerbrokers, blacks were not capable or worthy of assuming the responsibilities and power given to a film director.”
The film was produced by MTV Films and was released on July 16, 1999. Speaking of his partnership with MTV for "The Wood", Famuyiwa states, "Films had the best concept and could deal with it better because it was young, had the music and they wanted to make a film with predominantly African-American characters.” "The Wood" was produced for an estimated cost of $6 million and went on to gross over $25 million at the box office in the United States alone.
"Brown Sugar" (2002).
Rick Famuyiwa’s second feature film holds many similarities to his first. A recurring theme of flashbacks to one’s childhood is exhibited in this film and Famuyiwa once again employs the use of a predominantly African American cast, in fact, some of the characters in "Brown Sugar" also played roles in "The Wood".
In "Brown Sugar", lifelong friends Dre, played by Taye Diggs, and Sidney, played by Sanaa Lathan, cross paths and although each has their respective responsibilities and obligations to their significant others, they ultimately find that their affections for one another extend beyond platonic friendship. Additionally, hip-hop music plays an intricate part in the film as both Dre and Sidney are connected through their passion for the music genre and culture that emanates from it.
"Brown Sugar" was released on October 11, 2002. The film was marketed extensively by distributor Fox Searchlight Pictures and made $10 million in its opening weekend, ultimately grossing close to $28 million nationwide.
"Talk To Me" (2007).
"Talk To Me" was not actually a film that Rick Famuyiwa directed--he co-wrote the film with the film inspiration’s son, Michael Genet, and close friend Kasi Lemmons ultimately directed the film.
In the film, influential 1960s African American radio personality Ralph “Petey” Greene and his contributions to American popular culture and the Civil Rights movement are chronicled. The film explores the construction of race and race relations during this volatile period of American history.
"Talk To Me" was released on August 3, 2007. The independent film grossed $400,000 in its opening weekend and nationwide, the film made close to $5 million.
"Our Family Wedding" (2010).
Rick Famuyiwa’s most recent film is the comedy "Our Family Wedding" starring Forest Whitaker, America Ferrera, Carlos Mencia, and Lance Gross. Famuyiwa first became attached to the project two years prior, in 2008, when the presidential campaign was in full swing. With Barack Obama possibly becoming the first African American president, Famuyiwa was interested in making a film that would be reflective of the exciting, changing times. Recounting on the film, Famuyiwa expresses, “At the time the entire debate seemed to be around Hispanics voting for an African-American president. We’ve all seen these projections of how society is going to look in 50 years. We’re all going to have to deal with each other culturally. It felt like a great opportunity to tell that story without being preachy.”
Famuyiwa wrote and directed the film and similar to "The Wood", the film explores the institution of marriage but takes it a step further by incorporating competing, or at least differing, racial and cultural backgrounds that evolve throughout the course of the film. The "New York Times" critiqued the film saying, “Like weddings, wedding movies have their traditions: the dress is white and, usually, so are the characters. Fox Searchlight’s "Our Family Wedding", which opens this Friday, subverts that custom…”
In "Our Family Wedding", Famuyiwa’s upbringing in Inglewood’s heavily African American and Latino community shines through as the influence for the film’s basic premise. In the film, two college students, portrayed by the characters of America Ferrera and Lance Gross, decide to get married and must break the news to their family and loved ones. Fererra’s character and family represents the Latino cultural interests in the film while Gross’ character demonstrates that of the African American family. Commenting on his film, Famuyiwa states, “Wedding films are always about the differences between people but they haven’t quite dealt with African Americans and Latinos.” While playing to stereotypes and common rhetoric, the film transcends these boundaries and strives to provide an overarching message of acceptance despite racial and class differences that so often hinder everyday life.
"Our Family Wedding" was released on March 12, 2010. Produced by Fox Searchlight Pictures, the film made nearly $8 million in its opening weekend and overall, $20 million nationwide.
Recurring Themes.
In the majority of Famuyiwa’s films, friendship plays a central role to the characters’ development and progression throughout the film. In "The Wood", the male bonding between the three childhood friends is the main focus of the film. Commenting on the lack of male bonding depictions in African American Films, Famuyiwa says, “So just in general, if it's a man in the film, he's gotta be tough, he's gotta be carrying a gun, he's gotta be saving the world, and you rarely get to see that. But especially if you're talking about African American films. You never see that. I mean, you see the opposite, with Black women bonding, but you've never seen that for men.” Although "The Wood" was not revolutionary in its depiction of African American male bonding, it did provide audiences with an angle and message in cinema seldom seen elsewhere.
Additionally, thus far, nearly all of Famuyiwa’s feature films have dealt with the institution of marriage in one form or another. Often, marriage in Famuyiwa’s films coincides with race relations and the evolution of relationships that must grow and mature to accommodate each character’s specific needs and dreams.
Fighting for the Arts.
Rick Famuyiwa is part of the Director’s Guild of America and it is his passion to make African Americans a greater, more respected part of the cinema industry. Speaking of the pivotal role directors play in the cinema industry historian Melvin Burke Donalson writes, “Of the many creative people who collaborate on a motion picture, the director is regarded as the pivotal individual who governs the aggregate elements for completing the final film. In contemporary American cinema, the director serves as both the guiding force behind a film’s effective content and box office success. Films, consequently, have been called a director’s medium.” In 2003, Famuyiwa served on a panel of directors for a discussion conducted by the Directors Guild of America African American Steering Committee. In the panel, emerging African American directors Kasi Lemmons and Gary Hardwick joined Rick Famuyiwa as they discussed the challenges and opportunities faced by African American directors in the cinema industry. Reflecting on his own experiences of securing funding and support for his films, Famuyiwa believes that there are still many stereotypes and barriers to break down in the industry in order for African Americans to be accredited the respect they deserve.
There is a need for a paradigm shift in the way African Americans are perceived and portrayed in the cinema industry. Melvin Burke Donalson elaborates on this unsavory reality saying, “Many of the black urban films were in fact shaped by white writers, producers, and directors, often excluding African American filmmakers from the process. But despite the lack of control over depictions of their own people, a few black directors managed to chart out some movies that offered alternative ways of appreciating black culture.” Rick Famuyiwa, a young director of his generation, is actively working to create more opportunities for African Americans and shine the spotlight in their direction. Fellow filmmaker Gary Hardwick elaborates that “even though you have this notion that directors have all this power, it's a different thing to be a black director, and a different thing still to be a first time black director and have everybody assume that there are so many things that you cannot do. They see everything that can and will go wrong." The plight of African American films, directors, actors, screenwriters, and all other parties involved is that they are constantly relegated to a secondary, subpar consideration that is unwarranted and unfair.
A common belief and reality for African American filmmakers like Famuyiwa is that films with a majority black cast and direction often face obstacles in securing funding and support for such projects. Famuyiwa explains that there is a formula to be followed in order for anything to happen for a black director like himself saying, “Make it under $10 million, put this much into marketing, make 25 to 35 million dollars and we'll walk away with a profitable film. And as long as you can deliver scripts that are under $10 million with no effects, that you can shoot in 30 days and get back 'X' amount, I think you can always have a steady stream of a certain kind of film.” That particular, steady stream of film that Famuyiwa refers to is the kind that he and directors with likeminded visions attempt to transcend and instead, hope to inject depth and prompt critical response in the projects they pursue.
Furthermore, Kasi Lemmons, "Talk To Me" director and colleague of Rick Famuyiwa, explains, “There is a ceiling on what black films can possibly make, because only black people will go see the movie and even if they go to see it twice that only adds up to a certain amount.” While working on "The Wood", Famuyiwa experienced difficulties in generating the kind of support he would need to make the film a box office hit. In sum, it was hard for Famuyiwa to have others take him seriously at times. Melvin Burke Donalson writes, “Simply stated, the Hollywood director has traditionally been a white male, and though American narrative films date back to 1903, it wasn’t until the late 1960s that Hollywood allowed a black director to command a major film project. Two complex factors have contributed to this bleak history: (1) the history of the stereotypical screen images of blacks, and (2) the lack of a power base by blacks in the business of filmmaking.” Although the film did recuperate its costs, it did not reap the kinds of financial success that major Hollywood directors often experience. Often, it is hard enough just to find acceptance for films that feature an African American cast, let alone be directed and written by an African American. 
Famuyiwa’s colleague Gary Hardwick continues about the hardships faced by African American filmmakers saying, “The way to get a film made is to take away every reason that they shouldn't make the film. Then they'll say, ‘Damn I have to make it. I'm not scared to make this movie!’ It's a very strange process because they throw up strange roadblocks, ‘What about this? What about that? This could go wrong. That could go wrong!’ You have to allay all of their fears. The process of greenlighting a movie is strange, yet, one day you just have money.” At the end of the day, Famuyiwa and directors like him are struggling against the tide of the mainstream cinema industry. They are struggling to make a name not only for themselves but earn the recognition and respect that is due them for the entire African American community and beyond.
Awards & Recognition.
In 2000, The Black Reel Awards nominated Famuyiwa for Best Director (Theatrical) for his work on "The Wood". Additionally, Famuyiwa’s first feature film was nominated for Best Screenplay (Original or Adapted). Later on that year, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Image Awards nominated The Wood for Outstanding Motion Picture.
In 2003, after completing work on "Brown Sugar", perhaps Famuyiwa’s most famous work, Famuyiwa was once again nominated by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Image Awards for Outstanding Motion Picture.
In 2008, while working on "Our Family Wedding", Famuyiwa was recognized for his work on Kasi Lemmons’ "Talk To Me" by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Image Awards. The Association nominated "Talk To Me" for Outstanding Motion Picture and in a pleasant surprise, Famuyiwa won for Outstanding Writing in a Motion Picture (Theatrical or Television).

Coming of Age (Unitarian Universalism)

Coming of Age (CoA, COA) is a Unitarian Universalist program in which a congregation fosters the transition of its children into youth. Although COA programs vary by congregation, they typically mark the individual's transition from younger religious education programs into a youth group, District-level/Regional Young Religious Unitarian Universalists (YRUU), as well as National and Continental-level YRUU. Not all youth will enter into all of the levels of programming above, though entering into at least congregational-level YRUU (Youth group) is very common. At least one of the UUA districts holds a series of COA retreats to supplement congregational COA programs.
In most programs, a congregation's youth (usually aged 12 and above) are paired with adult mentors who are members of the congregation. Many programs ask youth to investigate their personal spirituality with the support of their mentors. Youth participants in the program are encouraged to develop a greater sense of what they believe. They do this through discussion, listening to guest speakers, and participating in retreats and workshops. Workshops may be designed to prompt the youth, challenge their modes of thinking, or aid them in furthering their ideas. Some congregations have also encouraged or required each child and mentor to do a social action or social service project together, or organized a service project which all participating youth and mentors do together, such as cooking and serving food at a soup kitchen.
At the end of many COA programs, youth and their mentors prepare a service in which they present "faith statements" or "credo statements" — written statements of belief and perspectives developed over the course of program. These statements vary in many ways, because there are few "guidelines" as to what youth may say. Typically, participants who do not wish to present a credo statement may communicate their findings in other ways; for example a choreographed dance or a musical piece they have written. Services vary from church to church and can involve almost anything that the participants want it to. Favorite hymns, dances, songs, and readings may be included.
For the most part, children identify with the faith beliefs of their parents and family. The Coming of Age program signals the beginning of individual spiritual searching; it is an official recognition that the youth involved have begun to search for personal truth.

Late night anime

Overview.
Late night anime is targeted toward anime fans or a teenage to young adult audience. One of the purposes of the late night broadcast is to promote DVDs or associated merchandise that are planned for release in the future. Other than original stories, many anime are based on manga, novels, or video games. The genres that tend to be preferred by anime fans include romantic comedy, slice of life story, action, or sci-fi, but there are exceptions. Most series are broadcast for 3 months or 6 months with 12 to 13 episodes for each block of 3 months. With the exception of NTV programs, few titles have longer than these broadcast times.
In most cases, a production committee (a group of several related companies) buys a time slot from a TV station. This process is known as brokered programming, and is similar to how infomercials are broadcast. Therefore, unlike ordinary programs, production companies are sponsoring companies as well. This way, TV stations can fill the time slots with low viewership, while production companies can advertise their products (anime DVDs) at a lower cost. Since a production’s purpose is to promote the title to fans, low ratings or a lack of sponsors is of little concern. Consequently, the number of late night anime is increasing. The fact that they rely on the sales of DVDs means that these anime are virtually the same as OVAs, except that they get a chance to be promoted. This is why "pure" OVA series have decreased rapidly.
Differences between TV and DVD versions.
When a late night anime is released on video or DVD, it tends to have the contents altered or expanded, such as:
Extras, like commentaries by the cast or production staff may also be added.
Such alteration often happens for television series, but this tendency is especially prominent for late night anime, because:
Broadcast area.
As of July 2006, there are 67 late night titles being broadcast, out of 95 total anime titles. This number includes those broadcast by satellite and UHF stations as well. However, not all are broadcast nationwide. Tokyo, for instance, has 49 late night anime series being broadcast. In Okinawa, only 3 of them are on the air.
In many cases, the title is broadcast only in the area of the station producing the anime (which, in most cases, is Tokyo). In other cases, they are only broadcast in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya. UHF anime tends to be broadcast in Osaka, Nagoya, and Kantō region, but not in Tokyo. There are some titles that are broadcast nationwide, but such cases are the exception, not the rule. In other areas, variety shows with local tarento are often popular, making anime's entry difficult. This is especially the case in Hokkaidō, where Yo Oizumi and his program are extremely popular.
If a household has access to CS satellite or cable television, the situation becomes a little better, because anime oriented pay CS satellite stations such as Kids Station, Animax, or AT-X broadcasts many of those titles. However, their broadcastings are often weeks or months behind the first run. Moreover, satellite and cable television are not as common in Japan when compared to the United States.
However, this situation is changing thanks to the increase of households which can watch BS satellite broadcasting. In November 2011, about 72 percent of Japanese can watch principal BS satellite broadcasting without charge such as BS11, BS-TBS, BS Fuji and BS Japan. As a result, the number of UHF anime broadcast by BS11 is increasing, and in 2012, BS11 broadcasts most of them. Moreover, BS11 broadcasts late night anime less than 8 days behind the first run. As to major network stations, since 2001, BS-TBS (previously called BS-i) has broadcast most TBS's anime though it didn't broadcast K-ON!! which was broadcast by all JNN terrestrial broadcasting stations, and from 2006 to 2012, BS Fuji had broadcast most Fuji TV's late night anime. However, in 2013, BS Fuji stopped broadcasting Fuji TV's late night anime, and BS Japan which is a subsidiary of TV Tokyo seldom broadcasts TV Tokyo's anime.
History.
The earliest late night anime titles include (1963–1964), (1987), and (1992). All of them were transmitted on Fuji TV. "Sennin Buraku" was from the longest running manga ever, still published in an adult magazine called "Weekly Asahi Geinō". "Lemon Angel" was an adult anime that is a spin-off of the adult OVA "Cream Lemon". "Super Zugan" was from a manga about mahjong. Those titles received some attention, but remained single experimental programs.
The title considered to be the true pioneer of late night anime is (1996) on TV Tokyo. At the time, several late night radio talk shows hosted by various voice actors were popular. As a genre, those programs were called "aniraji", the abbreviation of "anime" and "rajio" (radio). TV producers thought that if anime-related radio programs on late night can be popular, then anime TV programs on late night should work too. The result turned out as they wished. Because of this, TV Tokyo continued their late night time slots. In 1997, the time slots were expanded, and they became the basis of the "late night anime" that we now know. At the time, following the immense success of , the number of produced anime rapidly increased. Many of those titles came to late night slots. Nippon TV also started their late night anime with .
In 1998, Fuji TV restarted their late night anime. Also, BS satellite station WOWOW started their block with the complete version of , which had been incompletely broadcast in TV Tokyo's evening time slot.
The first UHF late night anime, "Legend of Basara" ("Rejendo obu Basara"), started that year as well. However, the true rise of UHF anime came with (2001). In 2001, BS digital station BS-i began their time slot with , making the cute title one of its killer contents.
In 2002, Fuji TV increased the number of programs that they broadcast. However, they did not value the otherwise filler programs with nearly zero ratings. Schedules of their late night anime became extremely unstable. For instance, when a program was on air at 2:25 A.M., the next week it was on air at 1:55 A.M. The week after, it was not broadcast, and the next week, 2 episodes were shown at 3:05 A.M. An extreme case was the last week of "Kanon", for which they broadcast the last 3 episodes in a marathon. Anime fans heavily criticized this attitude, and production companies began to avoid broadcasting on Fuji TV. The number of late night anime on Fuji TV has decreased, and in October 2004, it completely disappeared. However, from April 2005, they started the time block called "Noitamina", the block aimed for a young adult female audience, who otherwise would not watch anime. However, non-Noitamina anime, such as , still do not get a proper screening.
Censorship.
Japanese TV stations do not have a clear detailed system of parental guidelines. The only clear rule is that they cannot show sexual organs. However, they do have many tacit understandings of self-restriction. Bare breasts, for example, are difficult to broadcast on prime time.
TV Tokyo once broadcast radical programs such as "Evangelion" during the evening. However, in 1997, they had "Pokémon-shock", the incident that caused many children to feel ill by watching the "Pokémon" episode that contained many flashing lights. After the incident, TV Tokyo's self-restriction codes became much more strict.
Now, TV Tokyo and Fuji TV are said to be extremely strict on sexual descriptions. Naked bodies are censored, and female underwear are censored as well. Even when a female character with a mini-skirt jumps, her skirt does not whip, which is often ridiculed by fans. These censorships on VHFs have become one of the primary reasons of the rise of UHF anime.
Outside Japan.
Late night anime are also distributed worldwide, but some titles do not make it into the airwaves and are only available in DVD, Blu-ray or legal Internet streaming releases. Anime series which have been aired at late night in Japan may be aired at more convenient times in other countries, be it on free-to-air or paid channels such as The Anime Network or Animax.
Some mainstream titles which are aired either at daytime or prime-time in Japan may end up in late-night slots overseas due to stricter local television regulation. Examples include popular titles such as "Bleach" and "Fullmetal Alchemist" which were aired in the evenings in Japan, but at late night in the United States. In Hong Kong, "Dragon Ball Z" was deemed as "mature" and aired in the weekend midnight slot, although it was considered appropriate for young viewers elsewhere in the world including Japan and the US. Due to the controversial nature of "Death Note" in some countries, local anime channel HERO TV airs it in near midnight, and only on weekends, with no rerun schedules.
Rise of UHF anime.
In Kantō region including Tokyo, the major nationwide network stations broadcast on analog on the VHF channels. The "independent" stations established to provide prefecture-specific programming broadcast on the UHF channels. They are members of the Japanese Association of Independent Television Stations. In Osaka the situation is similar with exception of TV Osaka. (Note that all the Japanese terrestrial television are switching to UHF digital. In 2011, all analog transmissions on both VHF and UHF are scheduled to close.)
However, because these UHF stations are obscure, they do not have strong restrictions. Also, their time slots were much cheaper than those of VHF stations. Avoiding strict restrictions by a nation-wide television network, and avoiding random scheduling by Fuji TV, many anime, especially those with a lot of fan service, began to be broadcast on UHF stations. This even more obscure method still proved to be fairly effective, and UHF anime time slots continued to expand, especially from 2001. In 2006, if UHF stations are to be treated as one network (which they are not), it now broadcasts the largest number of late night anime (16), even more than TV Tokyo (8). However, many shows suffer from lower budgets compared with VHF shows.
Because of loose self-restriction codes, many of the titles contain sexual or violent expression that is impossible to broadcast on VHF stations. Examples include "Rizelmine" and . (The latter title, however, was still heavily edited.) Nevertheless, as UHF anime continue to expand, they recently have more varieties. Shōjo titles such as are now also broadcast. , a show which can be watched by young children, is a UHF late night anime, too. As became a huge hit, UHF late night anime has lost the "cheapest, but the most obscure option" description.
Similar tendencies can be seen in other channels as well, such as WOWOW, BS-i, and CS channels on SkyPerfecTV!. It is notable that AT-X, a pay-channel on SkyPerfecTV!, broadcast "Elfen Lied" unedited. It is on WOWOW and BS-i, as well as other CS channels that the rest of Asia who can receive their signal gets a view of these UHF anime.

Ardingly railway station

Ardingly was a railway station which served the West Sussex village of Ardingly in England. It was opened on 3 September 1883 by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR), and closed eighty years later. Currently used as an aggregates depot, the Bluebell Railway has long-term plans to extend its activity to Ardingly. Most of the trackbed from Horsted Keynes is now owned by the Bluebell Railway .
History.
Opening and route.
The LBSCR opened a 4½-mile link line between Horsted Keynes on its Lewes to East Grinstead Line and Haywards Heath on the Brighton Main Line. Doubled throughout, the line curved away from Horsted Keynes over Sheriff Mill Viaduct (117 yards and named after the nearby Lower Sheriff Farm), climbing on a gradient to reach Lywood Tunnel (218 yards) before continuing on the level for nearly 2 miles to reach the line's only intermediate station at Ardingly. From Ardingly, the line continued for a further mile to reach Copyhold Junction on the Brighton Line, just south of the Ouse Valley Viaduct. At first there was no signal box at the junction, with services running on an independent line parallel to the Brighton Main Line as far as the north-facing bay platform at Haywards Heath. A box was installed in 1912 which remained in use until 1932 when Haywards Heath was rebuilt with up and down loop platforms and a new box brought into service there.
The line opened without ceremony, with the first service, a goods train, leaving Haywards Heath at 8.34am to collect freight at Ardingly and continue to Horsted Keynes. It was later to prove its worth as a useful alternative to the Brighton Main Line in both wars and for specials to Lingfield Racecourse.
Station building and facilities.
Designed by Thomas Harrison Myres, the main station building was sited at road level away from the platforms. In common with other Lewes and East Grinstead line stations, it was constructed in a neo-Queen Anne style and presented as a two-storey Victorian country cottage. The upper storey is decoratively timbered with plaster patterning (flower patterns in black on a white background) and projecting slightly; unlike the other stations on the line, Ardingly was never tile-hung.
The station's two platforms had fairly basic facilities with platform awnings and an alcove-like waiting room on the down platform; a platform signal cabin was to be found at the western end of the station, overseeing a small goods yard. The yard saw considerable inward traffic in the form of timber for a local sawmill which was subsequently dispatched back out in consignments of prepared boards. The station was run by a staff of four: the stationmaster, signal porter, porter and assistant clerk; the last stationmaster left in 1926, at which point Ardingly came under the control of Horsted Keynes.
Operations.
The Ardingly branch had a very infrequent service under the LBSCR and following the grouping when the Southern Railway took over the line when it was mainly serviced by push-pull trains, with some through services to and from Brighton. Following electrification in 1935, the new electric service comprised some 18 trains on an hourly service to and from Horsted Keynes daily, around half of which terminated at Haywards Heath whilst the rest ran as far as Seaford. The Ardingly branch was closed on Sundays until 1945, and the connection from the up Ardingly line to the up Horsted Keynes main platform was severed. 
Camping coaches were stationed at Ardingly from Summer 1930 until the end of the war, an acknowledgment of Ardingly's popularity amongst ramblers who were ferried to and from the station in special trains. The station was also busy at the beginning and end of term at Ardingly College when up to 450 packages of luggage were sent and received for around 250 pupils.
Closure.
After the closure of the Lewes to East Grinstead line in 1958 by British Railways (BR), the down line between Horsted Keynes and Ardingly was used as a siding for condemned Kent Coast steam stock and new electric stock, whilst single line working with electric train staff was introduced on the up line. The branch was itself closed on 28 October 1963. The section was however still used occasionally to transport rolling stock to the newly established Bluebell Railway, and the last movement along the line was recorded on 13 May 1964 when Terrier No 32636 passed through prior to lifting of the track. The lifting, which had commenced on 15 July, had reached Horsted Keynes by 21 September. During the summer of 1968, Sheriff Mill Viaduct was demolished as the Mid Sussex District Council wished to straighten the bend on New Lane as it curved under the viaduct; BR was only too happy to relieve itself of the maintenance costs of the structure. The Bluebell Railway had been invited to purchase the line in 1962, but could not afford BR's asking price of between £25,000-£30,000 together with the £10,000 needed to maintain the viaduct.
Present day.
An Amey Roadstone plant (now Hanson Aggregates) was established in the Ardingly goods yard shortly after closure of the line, and was served by a daily freight working from Haywards Heath using the former down local line. Access to the up main and up local lines at Copyhold Junction has been severed. The new occupant demolished the station platforms (except for a short length near the road bridge). The track in the station was removed and a loop installed at the southern end of the former goods yard area. The station buildings remain, used as offices by Hanson Aggregates. A pair of ornamental cast iron station canopy brackets and the ticket office window were sold as lots 302 & 303 by auctioneers T. Bannister & co. at their July 1983 auction at the Ardingly historic vehicle spectacular show at the South of England Showground.
Preservation future.
In 1997 the Heritage Bluebell Railway acquired the trackbed as far as the Aggregate Depot boundary at Ardingly, and holds long-term aspirations to reopen the branch. To help bridge the gap created by the missing (Sheriff Mill) viaduct, spoil from the excavation of Imberhorne cutting (part of the works necessary for the Bluebell's extension towards East Grinstead) is gradually being used to extend existing embankments. Re-signalling work had also taken place at Horsted Keynes, with signals being installed in preparation for the eventual re-laying of the track. Mid Sussex District Council has accordingly safeguarded the route of the line from re-development that would be prejudicial to its reinstatement.

Clarinette d'amour

The clarinette d'amour is a musical instrument, a member of the clarinet family. In comparison with the B and A soprano clarinets, the clarinette d'amour had a similar shape and construction, but was larger, usually pitched in G. (Examples in A and F are also known.) However, it had proportionally smaller tone holes and bore, and a pear-shaped or sometimes globular bell (called 'Liebesfuß') similar to that of the cor anglais; these features gave the instrument its distinctive timbre.
It first appeared around the middle of the 18th century and was popular in central Europe, but was regarded as obsolete by the mid 19th century. It has been conjectured that the basset horn, which shares the features of low pitch and small bore, was developed from the clarinette d'amour.

Claire de la Fuente

Clarita Crisostomo Dela Fuente-De Guzman (born December 28, 1958), better known as Claire de la Fuente, is a Filipino singer who achieved celebrity status in the late 1970s with the jukebox hit "Sayang". She was given the title "Asia's Sweetest Voice" because of her sweet voice. She was dubbed "the Karen Carpenter of the Philippines" as her voice has a striking resemblance to that of the late singer. Her first album in 1977 was then the Philippines' biggest ever seller. She went on to record seven more albums. Besides "Sayang", she is also known for hits like "Minsan-Minsan" and "Nakaw Na Pag-ibig".
She was awarded the title "Queen of Tagalog Songs" alongside Rico J. Puno as her counterpart. She was also named "Jukebox Queen" together with her contemporaries Imelda Papin, Eva Eugenio and the late Didith Reyes. She was also dubbed as "Asia's Sweetest Voice" and won praises from musicians such as Stevie Wonder, Roberta Flack, Michael Bolton, David Soul and Richard Carpenter (of The Carpenters).
She is also a successful businesswoman. She is the president of the Integrated Metropolitan Bus Operators Association (IMBOA), though her bus franchise was cancelled in 2011 for joining a nationwide transport strike.
Biography.
De la Fuente was 15 when she bagged the grand prize in the first singing contest she joined, singing The Carpenters' "Love Me for What I Am". By that time, the Accounting freshman at the University of the East knew she loved singing and was aware that she sounded like Karen Carpenter after a high school classmate had pointed it out.
Composer George Canseco, a fellow UE Alumni, and the head judge in the contest, gave the singer her first break by having her sing the jingle in a Hope cigarette commercial that became popular for its "imported" sound.
De la Fuente left show business in her mid-20s after reaping its financial rewards. She was married by that time, having tied the knot at 19 to a man 10 years her senior. In 1993, she set up the King of Kings Transport, which had to fold up a few years later. It wasn't the lucrative business she had hoped it would be.
Six years later, de la Fuente was elected president of the Integrated Metro Bus Operators Association (IMBOA), whose members make up 70 percent of all bus operators in Metro Manila. In 2003, de la Fuente made headlines when she spearheaded a boycott of the color-coding scheme that the MMDA had imposed for a week on all public utility vehicles as part of a traffic experiment. The move put her at odds with the equally headstrong MMDA Chairman Bayani Fernando.
In 2003, de la Fuente went back to school to study transportation management at PUP then went ahead and finished a Masters in Business Administration at the University of Western Australia in 2005.
Besides being the spokesperson of the entire Public Transportation industry, she has become a very successful businesswoman. She dabbled into the cosmetics industry, opening up The Skin Shop. Alongside this, she showcased her flair for culinary arts and opened Gracielo's and Claire de la Fuente Seafood and Grill.
In December 2006, her husband and best friend for more than 28 years, Moises (Boy) de Guzman, died after a five-month struggle with cancer. He left behind de la Fuente together with their two sons, Gregorio (Gigo) and Gracielo (Mickey).
In 2008, she teamed up with Richard Carpenter for her international album "Something In Your Eyes".
In 2010, she recorded a duet with Michael Bolton, "The Christmas Song". The duet was included on her "The Christmas Album" under Viva Records.

Cinnamon becard

The cinnamon becard ("Pachyramphus cinnamomeus") is a passerine bird found in Latin America.
Taxonomy.
It has been placed with the tityras in the cotinga or the tyrant flycatcher families by various authors, but the evidence strongly suggest the tityras and their closest relatives are better separated as Tityridae. The AOU for example advocates this separation.
Description.
The adult cinnamon becard is 5.5 in (14 cm) long and weighs 0.6–0.8 oz (17–22 g). It is rufous above and paler cinnamon below, with a grey bill and legs. Unlike other becards, the sexes are similar, but the young are brighter above and paler overall. Northern birds have a pale supercilium and dusky line from the bill to the eye, but the subspecies "Pachyramphus cinnamomeus magdalenae" west of the Andes shows more contrast, with a stronger supercilium and blackish loral line.
The calls include high thin whistles. The males' song is a plaintive ascending "dee dee dee dee dee dee de" while the females' is a weaker "deeeu dew dew, dew dew".
Distribution and habitat.
The cinnamon becard is a resident breeding species from south-eastern Mexico south to north-western Ecuador and north-western Venezuela. It was recently found to be far more common on the Amazonian slope of the Colombian Cordillera Oriental than previously believed.
It occurs over a wide range of altitudes, from almost sea level to (albeit rarely) more than 5,000 ft (1,700 m) ASL; they prefer disturbed habitat like open woodland including forest edges and clearings, mangroves, and secondary forest e.g. dominated by Naked Albizia ("Albizia carbonaria", Fabaceae).
Behaviour.
Breeding.
The nest, built by the female at the tip of a high tree branch 8–50 ft (2.5–15 m) up, is a spherical structure of plant material with a low entrance, which for protection is often built near a wasp nest. The typical clutch is 3–4 olive brown-blotched brownish white eggs, laid between March and July and incubated by the female alone for 18–20 days to hatching. The male helps to feed the young.
Feeding.
Cinnamon becards pick large insects and spiders off the foliage in flight. They also regularly hover to take small berries.

James A. Jensen

James Alvin Jensen (August 2, 1918 – December 14, 1998), was an American paleontologist. His extensive collecting program at Brigham Young University in the Utah-Colorado region which spanned 23 years was comparable in terms of the number of specimens collected to that of Barnum Brown during the early 20th century. He was given the name "Dinosaur Jim" during the media coverage of his activities. Perhaps his most significant contribution to paleontology was to replace the 19th-century web of external metal struts, straps and posts that had been used to mount dinosaurs with a system of supports which were placed inside of bones, which produced free-standing skeletons with few or no obvious supports.
He is credited with naming and describing "Supersaurus" (1985) and "Torvosaurus" (with Peter Galton, 1979).
Life to 1956.
Jensen was born in 1918 in Leamington, Utah and developed an interest as a child exploring the desert and mountains with his father. While working in the now-defunct mining town of Mercur, Utah, he met his future wife, Marie M. Merrell. Neither had finished high school, which limited their options. Casting about for ways to begin their life, they decided to take advantage of the Federal Homestead Act and settled in Seward, Alaska which was still an unpopulated frontier. They married in 1941, and identified the plot of land that they intended to homestead.
However, in anticipation of World War II, the U.S. Army moved into Seward in July, 1941, and started construction on Fort Raymond. The massive influx of military personnel forced many civilians, including them, to return to the "Lower 48". They settled in Salt Lake City, and had two sons. He went through a crash training program on the University of Utah campus to become a machinist and welder. Upon completing the brief program, he received an appointment as a civilian contractor from the federal government, then went to Hanford, WA to work on nuclear "Reactor B" pile of the Manhattan Project, after which he transferred to Pearl Harbor to work in the reconstruction. Jensen returned to Utah in 1945, where he worked at odd jobs such as washing machine repairman, creamery man, truck driver, ceramics, gunsmith, linoleum block printing, sculpting, welder, machinist, taxidermist, inventor, and writer. During this time he met Arnie Lewis who worked at the Utah Field House of Natural History. They became friends and Lewis hired him to mount several birds of prey, later moving to the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University. In 1951, Jensen and family went to Seward, Alaska where he worked the next five years as a dockside longshoreman.
Artist and sculptor.
As an artist, he worked in most media. His pastel and acrylic paintings, reflecting his love of flowers, landscapes, and his appreciation of American Indians. His painting are hung from Alaska to Florida. In 1972, the Humble Oil Company listed him in a publication of artists of Alaska as one of the best-known pre-WW II artist. He sculpted in stone and metal, honing skills which were useful in developing a new system for mounting dinosaurs.
Harvard University 1956 to 1961.
Alfred Sherwood Romer, Harvard University, hired Jensen in 1956, at the suggestion of Arnie Lewis. He was trained as a preparator in the Department of Vertebrate Paleontology in the Museum of Comparative Zoology of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. In addition to working on collections and exhibits for several departments, he participated in these collecting expeditions with Romer and Lewis during those five years:
"Kronosaurus queenslandicus".
In 1956, Romer decided to mount a "Kronosaurus queenslandicus" skeleton and had to obtain an unusually large amount of money to do the job. This was because the weight of the final mount was estimated to exceed the carrying capacity of the floor on which it would rest, due to the large amount of steel that would be used in preparing the mount. Therefore, architects drafted plans for a large I-beam to span the entire width of the building. Then two large holes were opened in the external walls and permanent mounts were created on each wall to hold the beam. Cranes then raised and inserted the beam into the holes so that it spanned the entire floor and was then secured to the two mounts. Romer Lewis and Jensen decided how to mount "Kronosaurus". Jensen had plans showing how to mount a dinosaur without visible supports, plans which relied on his talents as an artist, sculptor, house framer, machinist and welder. Romer gave his approval to attempt a free standing mount. The plans were modified to suit the actual skeleton and "Kronosaurus" became the first mount done anywhere without visible structural members. All supporting bars, beams and sheets of metal and wood were integrated into or behind the bones. In addition to the unique method of concealing structural elements, Jensen used a curved back wall that had no corners to create the trompe d'oeil effect of a floating skeleton. There were no corners, vertical walls, or lines which would create the impression that the "Kronosaurus" was standing on the floor.
Brigham Young University 1961 - 1984.
When he went to Brigham Young University, he helped develop the Paleontology program. He worked in the field every summer amassing a large collection of packaged bones in matrix. He continued to refine new mounting techniques, prepared specimens, describing some, and attempted unsuccessfully to obtain funding for an earth sciences museum. The bulk of his summer work was done in Western Colorado and Utah. In addition, he went on a second six-month expedition with Harvard University to Ichigualasto, Argentina, and went to Antarctica for three months in an expedition headed up by Ohio State University. His most significant find in Antarctica was a maxilla of a "Lystrosaurus" on Coalsack Bluff.
Dry Mesa Quarry.
Starting in 1972, because of the remarkable range of species and number of specimens, he focused on Dry Mesa in Western Colorado. He did work other locales, but the bulk of his collecting time was spent at Dry Mesa which is probably the richest dinosaur quarry discovered in North America in the second half of the 20th Century.
New dinosaurs.
Following is a list of new species that Jensen described. While the descriptions are sound, his publications reflected his lack of formal training, resulting in errors made in the assignment of sauropod material from Dry Mesa. Caveat all descriptions of Ultrasauros-Ultrasaurus-Superaurus.
He did not describe all of the new species that were identified as they were collected. Additional new species will be described for Dry Mesa as they are worked out and studied at BYU.
Publications.
Although he didn't complete a formal education, Jensen starting publishing in the "Alaska Sportsman" in 1955, while working as a longshoreman in Seward, Alaska.
Legacy.
Free-standing mounts.
The technique for mounting free-standing dinosaurs was developed by Jensen in 1957, while participating in the mount of "Kronosaurus queenslandicus".
Cooperation with rock hounds.
As noted above, part of his success in finding specimens was due to his interest in "rock hounds" who jointly combed thousands of square miles of ground each year. He visited them every year or so, cultivating their friendship with gifts of dinosaur bones in return for information about their latest finds. In several instances, he named new dinosaurs after the person who led him to it.
Education.
Another legacy was Jensen's interest in educating the public about dinosaurs. He enthusiastically educated the public by welcoming them into his quarries each summer. He received hundreds of letters from school kids and answered them all. In spite of the fact that BYU denied Jensen a teaching role, he encouraged graduate students to take up the profession. Today, there is a small group of graduate students who became paleontologists as a result of his efforts.
BYU Museum of Paleontology.
The BYU Museum of Paleontology was built around Jensen's collection.
Ankle and foot versus feathers in arboreal life.
Jensen collected "bird" bones in the Dry Mesa Quarry and became interested in the changes necessary for species to move from terrestrial to arboreal life. For him the "sine qua non" of arboreal life was not feathers. It was the ability of organisms to actually live in trees. This required that they be able to grasp branches, to build nests where they laid eggs and then reared young, and to sleep on small branches for many hours. Feathers don't confer these advantages to the foot or ankle. He studied ankles and feet of a wide range of mammals including a recently deceased elephant which was brought to him in a refrigerated railroad car, birds, amphibians and any creatures with leg bones and feet. His conclusion was that evolution of the ankle and foot was the fundamental change which had to occur so that species could move permanently, regardless of feathers or not, from the ground into the branches of trees. His research over several years on ankles and feet of various fossil and extant species supported this hypothesis. Ultimately he wrote an article discussing his hypothesis and findings and illustrated it with his own drawings of bones. But out of pique at the time at the world of paleontology, he had the article translated into Japanese and then published it in a Japanese science magazine.
Honorary doctorate.
In 1971, Jensen was granted an honorary doctorate by Brigham Young University.

Miles Evergood

Miles Evergood (10 January 1871 – 3 January 1939) was an Australian artist who achieved renown in Europe and the United States, as well as his native country. He was the father of American artist Philip Evergood.
Biography.
Evergood was born Myer Blashki in Melbourne, eleventh child of Phillip Blashki, manufacturer of masonic regalia and jeweller, and his wife Hannah, "née" Immergut.
Evergood was educated at the Melbourne Hebrew Day School and Angel College, later crediting his ability to write and to argue to influential teachers there, especially Rev. Jacob Goldstein. Goldstein in 1908 wrote a front-page article about Evergood in the "New York Hebrew Standard". He studied at the National Gallery School of Art under Frederick McCubbin and Bernard Hall between 1893 and 1895. His friends and colleagues were the group who exhibited the first recognisable style of Australian painting. They included Max Meldrum, George Coates, and James Quinn, who formed themselves into bohemian clubs to discuss contemporary concerns like socialism and the rights of the individual.
Evergood exhibited at the Victorian Artists Society, and the Royal Art Society of New South Wales, Sydney, before leaving for the United States in 1898 together with fellow-artist Frank (Francis) McComas. He worked for the Hearst newspapers in San Francisco before moving on to New York, where he exhibited and was subsequently invited to be a member of both the Salamgundi and Lotos Clubs. He went to London, where he married Flora Jane Perry, whom he had probably met in Sydney. The family moved to New York, where art critics Henri Pene du Bois and James Huneker wrote glowingly of his works. as did Hanna Astrup Larsen in the glossy journal "International Studio". Miles and Flora had one child, named Philip Howard Francis Dixon Blashki (1901-1973). In 1910 Miles exhibited five paintings in the first exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists held in New York.
For about twenty years he regularly visited Europe, establishing a good reputation as a painter. After returning with the family to live in England in 1910. in 1914 he his landscape was hung the Paris Salon. For eight years he exhibited with the International Society, at Burlington House, with the Society of Painters and 'Gravers and the New English Arts Club. He changed his name to Miles Evergood about 1914 in London, to enable his son Philip to get a commission in the British Navy. Then-Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill wrote a handwritten reply to his query, suggesting that "Blashki" was not a suitable name for an officer in an Anglo Saxon navy.
Evergood returned to Australia in July 1931 and worked for eighteen months in Queensland and became a member of the Royal Queensland Art Society. He then went to Sydney and then Melbourne holding exhibitions of his work, and died of cancer in Melbourne on 3 January 1939. Evergood was a capable artist, who mostly painted landscapes in oil with affinities to the post impressionists. He left a de facto partner, Pauline Konitzer Romero, and his son, Philip Evergood, who became an artist living in America, substantially eclipsing the career of his father Miles.

The Spot, New South Wales

The Spot is a locality in south-eastern Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The Spot is located in the south-eastern part of the suburb of Randwick, around the intersection of Perouse Road and St Pauls Street. It is a vibrant part of Randwick and consists of a collection of shops, restaurants, cafes and a cinema.
The Spot is a heritage conservation area and has many heritage listed buildings, such as The Ritz Cinema and Pan Arcadian House, a 1930s Masonic Temple and most notably the facade of shops on the corner of Perouse Road and St Pauls Street which follows a curved pattern, necessary for the tram route which used to extend to Coogee Beach.
The Royal Hotel and Randwick shopping centre are a short distance away. The area is well served by public transport with regular buses from the Sydney CBD and Bondi Junction.
Name.
The Spot lies at the geographic centre of a residential suburb that some maps identify as “St Pauls”. The post office located at The Spot is also officially "St Pauls 2031." However, the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales does not list “St Pauls” as an officially registered place name within the Randwick Local Government Area.
The locality name of "The Spot", too, is not officially registered with the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales and, despite wide use, would appear to remain unofficial.
History.
Early days of the colony.
Research by a local historical society has revealed that The Spot probably lies on trails that were made through the bushland by members of earliest European settlements in Sydney Cove. Centrally placed at The Spot is a plinth on which is mounted a plaque that notes:
Between January and March, 1788, members of the Lapérouse expedition at Botany Bay and the First Fleet at Sydney Cove passed this place on goodwill visits. Their route is followed closely by parts of Avoca St., Frenchmans Rd. and Perouse Rd. Randwick.
'Struggletown'.
During the early years of the Randwick municipality, the area to the west of The Spot (Barker and Botany Streets) was home to labourers and workmen who built some of the finer homes in the Randwick area and the area was often referred to as 'Struggletown' or, less commonly, 'Irish Town'. The Struggletown name lives on near The Spot, in the form of the business name of the local veterinary clinic.
Cultural activities.
The Ritz Cinema.
The Ritz Cinema, built in 1937, is an example of the art deco cinema architecture that found a home in Australia during the 1920s and 1930s. The architect, Aaron Bolt, is known for his classic art deco buildings throughout Sydney, such as his commissions for grand apartment buildings in Potts Point.
Since its construction, the cinema has been owned by, among others, the Hoyts cinema group and the Brigidine Sisters (an order of nuns running the adjacent Brigidine College). In the late 1980s the current owners planned to demolish the existing cinema and to redevelop the site. The current owners refurbished the building in the late 1990s, adding additional cinemas to the original single principal cinema theatre in order to allow The Ritz to survive in the era of competition with larger multiplex cinema chains. 
In 1997, The Ritz Cinema was placed on the Register of the National Estate by the Australian Heritage Council. That record notes that
The Ritz Cinema is the only one of three remaining theatres of this style in an unaltered state still used as a cinema in New South Wales and is one of the few surviving examples of the hundreds of cinemas which were built during the 1930s, one of the most creative periods of cinematic design in Australia. ... The Ritz, which has operated almost continuously as a movie theatre since 1937, has social values as a community cultural entertainment centre in the Randwick area. The place is also highly valued by the Art Deco Society. ... The Ritz is significant for its intact and well detailed Art Deco design and is a prominent element in the St Paul's Road urban precinct ...
The Spot Food and Film Festival.
Since 2008 Randwick City Council has held an annual food and film festival at The Spot featuring special screenings of films at The Ritz, live performances and food stalls. The Spot Food and Film Festival is run as a part of the Coogee Arts Festival.
The Spot Walk of Fame.
In 2008, Randwick City Council established "The Spot Walk of Fame", which is a "recognition of successful Australian artists in the film industry" and consists of a series of brass plaques set in the pavement on the northern side of St Pauls Street. The Council has noted that The Spot Food and Film Festival will provide an ongoing opportunity for additional notable persons to be inducted into the Walk of Fame in the future. The first person recognised in the Walk of Fame was Australian actor Charles "Bud" Tingwell, whose plaque stands outside the Ritz Cinema. Other Australian cinema identities commemorated on the Spot Walk of Fame include: Michael Caton; Roy Billing; Steve Bisley; and Claudia Karvan.
Architectural heritage in the area.
Under the Randwick Local Environment Plan 1998 (Consolidation) a number of buildings in the vicinity of The Spot are listed as "heritage items" and the immediate locale a designated "Heritage Conservation Area". Buildings within the Heritage Conservation Area around The Spot include:

Wiergate, Texas

Wiergate is a small unincorporated community in Newton County, Texas, United States, in the far eastern part of the state. It lies approximately northeast of Beaumont near State Highways 63 and 87. Its population today hovers around 450 (recorded as 461 in the 1990 US Census).
Historical development.
Along with Bon Wier, it was founded as a company town to service the needs of Wier Longleaf Lumber Company, the last of the major lumber milling operations in East Texas which was founded by Robert Withrow Wier (1873-1945) and family in 1917. At its height in the 1920s and 1930s, it had a population of over 2,500, but with the sale of the lumber mill in 1944, the population slowly declined to its current levels.

Battle of Go Cong

The Battle of Go Cong was a small battle during the Vietnam War. It took place on September 3, 1963, after the General Staff of the Viet Cong (NLF) called for "another Ap Bac" on South Vietnamese forces. The intent of the operation was to drive out the rebels who had survived the earlier Ap Bac engagement. The battle was won by American and South Vietnamese forces, after inflicting heavy casualties on the Viet Cong, using artillery to slaughter rebel fighters fleeing American special operation troops who ambushed them with intense sniper fire. It was later discovered that the 91 of the captured NLF troops were new recruits, and did not have weapons.

Alfred James Ewart

Alfred James Ewart, FRS, (12 February 1872 – 12 September 1937) was an English-Australian botanist.
Ewart was born in Toxteth Park, Liverpool, England, second son of Edmund Brown Ewart, B.A. and his wife, Martha "née" Williams. Alfred was educated at the Liverpool Institute and University College, Liverpool, Ewart graduated Ph.D. at Leipzig University and D.Sc. at Oxford. He was a demonstrator of botany at Liverpool, and subsequently Science Master at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and lecturer on botany at Birmingham University, where he was for a time deputy professor. In 1905 Ewart was appointed Professor of Botany at the University of Melbourne. He had already completed a laborious and useful piece of work, his translation of Wilhelm Pfeffer's treatise on "The Physiology of Plants", the first volume of which was published in 1900, the second in 1903, and the third in 1906. He had also published "First Stage Botany" (1900), "New Matriculation Botany" (1902), of which many impressions were subsequently published under the title "Ewart's Elementary Botany; On the Physics and Physiology of Protoplasmic Streaming in Plants" (1903), and "Rural Calendar" (1905).
In 1906, Ewart became the foundation chair of botany and plant physiology at the University of Melbourne. for the next 15 years Ewart was also government botanist. In 1909, in collaboration with James Richard Tovey, who conducted the field research, he published a useful work on "The Weeds, Poison Plants and Naturalized Aliens of Victoria", and in 1917, in collaboration with Miss Olive B. Davies. "The Flora of the Northern Territory". At the university Ewart had no separate building and for many years shared the biology school building with Sir Baldwin Spencer. After World War I a separate department for botany was built. In 1927 Ewart was asked by the government to prepare a new "Flora of Victoria" which, with some assistance from other scientists, was completed and published in 1930. Other works not already mentioned include a "Handbook of Forest Trees for Victorian Foresters" (1925), and many papers in scientific journals, some of which were reprinted as pamphlets. Ewart died suddenly on 12 September 1937. Ewart was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1922. Ewart was president of Section D (Biology) of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Melbourne in 1921, and of Section M (Botany) at Perth in 1926. He married twice, firstly to Florence Maud Donaldson, a violinist and composer of ability, in 1898 and secondly to Elizabeth Bilton in 1931. There were two sons of the first marriage.

Flaming Teeth, from Fijian mythology, was a giant who was so large his teeth appeared as burning logs. 
The giant tormented villages day after day, eating people and wreaking havoc. After so much burning and consuming of villagers a band of brave men from the village got together. They made a plan to surprise and ambush the giant by luring it under a giant rock and smashing its skull with it. They succeeded killing the giant but its teeth still were aflame. The villagers took the teeth back to the village and that was the first time man acquired the use of fire.

Joseph Carlebach became rabbi, like many of his brothers, to wit David Carlebach, Emanuel Carlebach (rabbi in Memel and Cologne), Hartwig Naftali Carlebach (rabbi in Berlin, Baden near Vienna and New York), and Ephraim Carlebach (rabbi in Leipzig). Joseph Carlebach completed extensive studies in natural sciences. From 1901 on he studied at Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Berlin natural sciences, mathematics, astronomy, philosophy and history of art. The quantum physicist Max Planck and the philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey (hermeneutics) were among his teachers. In 1908 he graduated as high-school teacher (Oberlehrer-Examen) of natural sciences (at "summa cum laude"). In the same time Carlebach attended the orthodox Rabbinical Seminary in Berlin. In 1905 to 1907 Carlebach interrupted his studies in Germany and taught at the "Lämel-School" in Jerusalem. There Carlebach learned to know a number of excellent rabbis. 
In 1909 Carlebach passed degrees in mathematics, physics and Hebrew at Ruprecht-Karls-Universität in Heidelberg. There he also did his doctorate on the mathematician Levi ben Gershon ("Lewi ben Gerson als Mathematiker"). Carlebach gained academic reputation by books on Levi ben Gershon as well as on Albert Einstein's relativity theory in 1912. From 1910 to 1914 Carlebach finished his studies at the rabbinical seminary under rabbi David Hoffmann. In 1914 Carlebach was ordained rabbi.
World War I service.
During World War I Carlebach served in the imperial German Army, at the beginning as telegraphist. In 1915 he was assigned as educator - after recommendation by his brother-in-law Leopold Rosenak, a German Army Field Rabbi active in promoting German culture among the Jews in Lithuania and Poland during the German occupation (1915–1918). Erich Ludendorff's intention was to evoke pro-German attitudes among Jews and other Poles and Lithuanians, in order to prepare the installation of a Polish and a Lithuanian state dependent on Germany. Part of the effort was the establishment of Jewish newspapers (e.g. the folkist "Warszawer Togblat, וואַרשעווער טאָגבלאַט"), of Jewish organisations (e.g. Joseph's brother German Army Field Rabbi Emanuel Carlebach (*1874-1927*) initiated in Łomża the foundation of the hassidic umbrella organisation Agudas Yisroel of Poland, part of a non-Zionist movement founded in Germany in 1912) and of modern educational institutions of Jewish alignment. Joseph Carlebach founded the partly German-language "Jüdisches Realgymnasium גימנזיום עברי" (academic high school) in Kaunas (Kovno; the interwar capital of Lithuania) and directed it until 1919. The school was based on the German Torah im Derech Eretz model. The school provided both Jewish and secular studies both for men and women (separately) and was the model for the "Yavneh" network that Carlebach later founded in collaboration with Leo Deutschlander. In 1925 "Yavneh" was taken over by Joseph Leib Bloch (*1860-1930*), who relocated it to Telšiai (Russ.: Telshe, Yidd.: Telz טעלז) and incorporated it into the Rabbinical College of Telshe, which managed to re-establish in 1942 in the USA. In 1921 Carlebach became headmaster of the Talmud Torah high school in Hamburg. 
He served the Jewish communities of Lübeck (1919–22), Altona (1927–36) and Hamburg (1936–1941), as chief rabbi. The renowned Israeli jurist Haim Cohn described the effect Carlebach had on his students (as well as illustrating Carlebach's fairly unique position that Orthodox Jews may visit churches): 
Persecution under Nazi regime.
After Nazi Germany banned Jewish students from attending German schools together with "Aryan" German children, Rabbi Carlebach set up a number of schools throughout Germany to educate Jewish children. His schools bore his name and were known as "Carlebach-Schulen".
He was deported to the Nazi concentration camp Jungfernhof by the Nazis, where he was murdered on March 26, 1942 during the mass shooting of approximately 1600 Jews, mostly older people and children, that became known as the Dünamünde Action. This occurred in the Biķerniecki forest, near Riga, Latvia, which was the site of numerous other shootings perpetrated by the Nazis and their Latvian collaborators, in particular, the Arajs Kommando.
His wife and younger children were also killed during the Holocaust, one son Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach who became the "mashgiach ruchani" ("spiritual supervisor" students) at the Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin in Brooklyn, New York City after the war. His third daughter Prof. Miriam Gillis-Carlebach emigrated to Israel in October 1938, she has been teaching Education and Hebrew reading at Bar-Ilan University, in Ramat Gan, since 1973. In 1992 she became the head of the Joseph Carlebach Institute at Bar-Ilan University and has dedicated herself to researching her father's writings as well as the writing of other Jewish leaders of the same time period.
Rabbi Joseph Carlebach's wife managed to send her elder children to England, and they survived the war.
Memorials.
On 18 August 1954 Jerusalem honoured Carlebach's work, among others at the local "Lämel-School", by naming a street, Rekhov Carlebach/Karlibakh רחוב קרליבך, after him in the neighbourhood of Talpiot.
The memory of Joseph Carlebach was held in great honor by the City of Hamburg and its Jewish community. In 1990 part of the University Campus, the "Bornplatz"[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Former_synagogue_at_Bornplatz_Hamburg], the former location of the Main Synagogue of Hamburg and Rabbi Carlebach's last pulpit, was named as the "Joseph-Carlebach-Platz". In honor of his 120th Birthday in 2003, the "Joseph-Carlebach-Preis" (Joseph Carlebach prize) for Jewish studies was established, awarded every two years, by the State University of Hamburg.

Emil Carlebach

Emil Carlebach (July 10, 1914, Frankfurt, Hesse-Nassau - April 9, 2001) was a Hessian Landtag member, a writer, and a journalist. He was born and died in Frankfurt am Main. 
Life.
Emil Carlebach was descended from a family of rabbis who had practiced in Germany for generations. However, at the time he was born, his father was the only non-religious member of the Carlebach family in Frankfurt. While still young, Emil turned away from the conservative secular attitude of his parents and in 1932 he joined the Young Communist League of Germany ("Kommunistischen Jugendverband Deutschlands") KJVD. In early 1934, he was sentenced to three years in prison for spreading anti-fascist union publications. When the sentence was completed in 1937, he was sent to Dachau concentration camp and then imprisoned at Buchenwald in 1938. At Buchenwald, he was active in the illegal resistance organization. Following plans he designed, he launched "with the call to mutiny on April 4, 1945." He was to have been shot by the SS on April 6, 1945, for his efforts in the camp revolt, but was hidden by other prisoners and survived till liberation. After the liberation of the concentration camp, the prisoners from Buchenwald chose him as their spokesman; later he became the vice-president of the International Buchenwald Committee.
After 1954, he became first a Frankfurt city council member, then a member of the Hessian parliament, where he worked on the Hesse constitution. 
Carlebach was one of seven original licensees of the Frankfurter Rundschau, a licensed daily newspaper based in Frankfurt and the first licensed newspaper in the American Zone of Occupation in Germany. In 1947, without explanation, the U.S. Military Government in Germany revoked Carlebach's publisher's license. He was also a co-founder of the Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime ("Vereinigung der Verfolgten des Naziregimes") or VVN.
In the early 1950s a fierce dispute began between Carlebach and Margarete Buber-Neumann over the torture of German communists by Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union. Carlebach contested Stalin’s responsibility; he maintained this position his entire life. In connection with this dispute and later publications, Carlebach’s conduct towards those Buchenwald prisoners who he did not consider "loyal communists" was also criticized. Because of this, his former fellow prisoner, Benedikt Kautsky, accused him of being partially responsible for the death of least two Polish prisoners.
After the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) was banned in 1956, he fled to the "Deutsche Demokratische Republik" (DDR, East Germany). There he was a staff member for the "Deutscher Freiheitssender 904" (German Freedom Radio 904). After his return to the "Bundesrepublik Deutschland" (BRD, West Germany) he was active in the VVN, the German Communist Party (DKP) and the "Deutsche Journalistinnen- und Journalisten-Union" (dju, Union of German Journalists) until his death.

Harrington Lees

Harrington Clare Lees (17 March 1870 – 10 January 1929) was the Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne from 1921 until his death.
Family.
Lees was born in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, England, the eldest son of William Lees, a cotton farmer and Justice of the Peace, and his wife, Emma (daughter of William Clare, M.D.). Lees married twice, firstly to Winifred May, daughter of the Revd J. M. Cranswick, and secondly to Joanna Mary, daughter of Herbert Linnell. He had no children.
Education.
Lees was educated at The Leys School (a Methodist school) and St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA with a second class in the theological tripos in 1892, and MA in 1896.
Career.
Lees was ordained deacon in 1893 and priest in 1894. He was a curate at Reading, Berkshire, chaplain at Turin and curate at Childwall, until in 1900 he became vicar of St John's Kenilworth.
In 1907 Lees became vicar of Christ Church, Beckenham, and in 1919 vicar of Swansea. In this year he was offered the bishopric of Bendigo, Victoria, Australia, but refused it. In August 1921 he was appointed Archbishop of Melbourne and was consecrated at St Paul's Cathedral, London, on 14 August 1921, and enthroned at St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne, on 15 February 1922.
Lees soon showed himself to be a vigorous worker and a good preacher. He was at Melbourne for less than seven years before he died, but his episcopate was marked by the undertaking of the completion of St Paul's Cathedral and by a great increase in the social work of the church; more especially in connexion with the various homes conducted by the mission of St James and St John and the Church of England free kindergartens. He visited England in 1928 and died suddenly at Bishopscourt, East Melbourne, on 10 January 1929.
Lees' portrait by John Longstaff is in the chapter house at Melbourne.
Lees never spared himself and overwork was a contributing cause of his comparatively early death from coronary vascular disease. He had bright personality and was much like by everyone, whether in an industrial parish like Swansea or as archbishop of Melbourne. At synod he was an excellent chairman, speaking little himself, but giving his rulings with decision. In the evangelistic tradition of the diocese, he belonged to no party and his ability, humanity and broad outlook, made him an excellent leader of his church.
Publications.
Lees' published works include: 
Lees was also a contributor to Hastings' "A Dictionary of Christ and the Gospels".

The Armoury Show

The Armoury Show was a new wave band, formed in 1983 by Richard Jobson on vocals, Russell Webb on bass guitar, John McGeoch on guitar and John Doyle on drums. Each member had previously been in critically acclaimed and commercially successful bands; Jobson and Webb were in The Skids, whilst McGeoch and Doyle had been in Magazine.
The band was named after The Armory Show, a famous 1913 modern art exhibition held in New York, releasing six singles and one album, "Waiting for the Floods", in their brief existence.
History.
Previously, Richard Jobson and Russell Webb were both members of the Scottish Punk band The Skids, while John McGeoch and John Doyle had both been members of Post-punk pioneers Magazine.
The Skids had dissolved in 1981 and Magazine in 1982, following the release of their final, and commercially unsuccessful, albums ("Joy" and "Magic, Murder And The Weather", respectively). John McGeoch had actually left Magazine in 1980, before the recording of their last album, joining Siouxsie and the Banshees. He also replaced Stuart Adamson for a Peel Session recorded by The Skids in 1981.
According to Russell Webb, in the sleeve notes of the 2013 re-issue of their album "Waiting for the Floods", the intention was not to be a band, but a collective of musicians getting together to write songs and make music in the studio. But, McGeoch persuaded his compatriots to take their songs on the road and following a press showcase at The Venue in London, the band signed for Parlophone and EMI America.
Their debut single "Castles in Spain" was released in 1984, followed later that year by "We Can Be Brave Again". Given the green light to record an album, the band spent four weeks at Manor Studios in rural Oxfordshire, with producer Nick Launay at the controls. The resultant album "Waiting for the Floods" and accompanying singles "The Glory of Love" and a re-release of "Castles in Spain" came out in 1985.
But, Richard Jobson was a man in demand and he spent less and less time with the band. In 1986, following the tour to promote the album, both McGeoch and Doyle left the band, with the former joining Public Image Ltd. and the latter working with former Buzzcocks lead singer/guitarist Pete Shelley.
When Jobson returned from China, where he had been working as model, he reunited with Webb, calling on Dave Lockwood (guitar) and Ray Weston (drums) to record tracks for their next album. The singles "Love In Anger" and "New York City" marked a change in musical direction for the band, with the latter even sporting a dance mix. But all was not well and in 1988, it was announced that the band had split up, with what would have been their second album "Monkey Cry" promoted as Richard Jobson's solo debut "Badman". After a brief solo career Jobson became a successful television presenter and film director. Webb pursued a solo career (according to the band's unofficial fansite) before joining McGeoch in Public Image Ltd in 1992, making his live debut at The Reading Festival. In 2013, Webb was working in education.

St. Cuthbert's Co-operative Society

The St. Cuthbert's Co-operative Society opened its first shop in Ponton Street in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1859 as a Consumers' co-operative. This society was part of the movement started by the Rochdale Pioneers in 1844, and followed the Rochdale Principles with the aim of providing decent food at affordable prices in a shop controlled by its customers as a co-operative. It took its name from Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne.
As early as 1913 St. Cuthbert's had bought the Cliftonhall Estate which was almost 970 acres in area. In 1918 four more farms were bought on the Newtonhall Estate and in 1919 780 acres were purchased at Bonnington. By 1949 the Association owned over three thousand acres of land.
St Cuthbert's Co-op largest department store in Bread Street, Edinburgh was built in three stages to designs by three architects: John McLachlan (d.1893) in 1892; Thomas Purves Marwick (1854-1927) in 1898 and 1914 and Thomas Waller Marwick (c.1901-71) in 1936. The 1930s section features a glass 'curtain wall', the first of its kind in Scotland, in contrast to the stone facades of its late 19th-/early 20th-century neighbours.

St Cuthberts expanded to become one of the largest societies in the British co-operative movement, employing some 3,000 at its peak, before amalgamating with the Dalziel Society of Motherwell in 1981 and being renamed Scotmid. Its dairy used horse drawn delivery floats until 1985, and between 1944 and 1959 employed the future actor Sean Connery as a milkman.

USS Flint (AE-32)

USS "Flint" (AE-32/T-AE-32) is a of the United States Navy, and was named after the sparking rock flint (not, as is commonly thought, the city of Flint, Michigan). "Flint" was constructed at the Ingalls Nuclear Shipbuilding Division, Litton Industries, Inc., Pascagoula, Mississippi. The ship was delivered to the United States Navy at Charleston, South Carolina, on 30 August 1971.
Design.
"Flint" is capable of underway replenishment at a sustained speed of 20 knots, which enables her to keep pace with fast moving Naval task forces. Her modern transfer-at-sea facilities included the capability of utilizing two CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters for vertical replenishment (VERTREP). Normal alongside methods were improved by the installation of a ram tension wire system called STREAM - Standard Tensioned Replenishment Alongside Method. "Flint's" holds were specifically configured for ease of handling, loading and stowing of missiles, rocket boosters, and all types of munitions required by the Fleet. "Flint" is capable of providing living accommodations for more than 400 men and women.
Several new design innovations were incorporated in "Flint", including a bulbous bow for better streamlined hull. Another innovation was the APS (Automated Propulsion System) essentially a central console in an air conditioned space in the engine room which gives automatic readings of the performance of the engineering plant and allowed the bridge to directly control the engines.
Service history.
USS "Flint" was commissioned under the command of Captain Philip R. Bush following extensive sea trials. The ship then made a transit through the Panama Canal to its home port of Naval Weapons Station, Concord, California.
"Flint" made its first Western Pacific (WestPac) deployment in fall of 1972. It participated in numerous underway replenishment activities with ships of the US 7th Fleet in support of military operations off the coast of Vietnam including resupply of gunline destroyers and aircraft carriers participating in Operation Linebacker and Operation Linebacker II. Its helicopter detachment flew hundreds of sorties ferrying munitions to US naval ships in the operational theatre.
Captain Bush was relieved as Commanding Officer by Captain Thomas Rogers in December, 1972. In subsequent deployments in 1973-1974 and 1974–1975, "Flint" was assigned to naval forces in the Gulf of Aden in support of operations monitoring the Yom Kippur War, the Vietnam evacuation task force (Operation Frequent Wind) and rescue forces involved in the Mayagüez incident.
Captain Rogers was relieved as Commanding Officer by Commander John K. Ferguson in early 1974.
"Flint" served as ammunition supply ship during operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, 1990 to 1992, under Cmdr. Skirm and Capt. Thompson.
On 7 October 1993 a maintenance petty officer was killed attempting to ride a cargo elevator from a lower level to the main deck. At an Admiral's Mast, Flint's Commanding Officer Cmdr. Patrick J. Sharrett, accepted responsibility for the sailor's death and was relieved of command by Commander Logistics Group One.
Cmdr. John M. MacIntyre of Coronado, California, was the final commanding officer of the ship. The ship was under the operational command of Commander, Logistics Group 1. 
"Flint" completed 15 deployments to the western Pacific and received recognition for the dramatic 1978 rescue of 86 fishermen shipwrecked near Palawan Island, Philippines, during a typhoon.
Decommissioning and Transfer.
"Flint" was decommissioned at Naval Air Station Alameda, California, on 4 August 1995 after more than 23 years of service. The ship was transferred to the Military Sealift Command, at which time it became known as the USNS "Flint" (T-AE-32).
Under the Military Sealift Command, "Flint" operated with a smaller civilian crew operating the ship's major systems and a smaller Navy detachment responsible for communications and operational coordination. As an MSC asset, "Flint" participated in additional deployments to the Western Pacific and Persian Gulf.

Alexander Leeper

Alexander Leeper (3 June 1848 – 6 August 1934), was an Australian educationist.
Alexander Leeper, the son of the Rev. Alexander Leeper, canon of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, was born on 3 June 1848. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated B.A. in 1871 and M.A. in 1875, and St John's College, Oxford where he took a first-class BA in Literae Humaniores in 1874.
Leeper came to Victoria in 1875 as classical master for the Melbourne Church of England Grammar School but in the following year was made principal of Trinity College (University of Melbourne). The title of his office was afterwards changed to warden. He was not completely successful from the beginning, at one stage there was a revolt which ended in the expulsion of several students, but it became recognized that Leeper was devoted to the college, which he controlled with success for the remainder of his 42 years of office. 
Leeper also took an important share in the management of the university as a member of the council from 1880 to 1887 and 1900 to 1923. He resigned his position as warden of Trinity in 1918, but continued to be a prominent figure in Melbourne for many years longer as a member of the council of education, as a lay canon of St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne, and as a trustee of the public library, museums and National Gallery of Victoria of which he was president from 1920 to 1928. He was also a leading spirit in the Melbourne Shakespeare Society and the Classical Association. He was a great fighter on the North of Ireland side in all controversies relating to Irish questions. He died at Melbourne on 6 August 1934. An excellent portrait by John Longstaff is in the National Gallery of Victoria at Melbourne.
Leeper was a man of strong personality and force of character, who did valuable work. He was a sound classical scholar, but beyond some lectures and pamphlets his only publication was his translation of Thirteen Satires of Juvenal, originally prepared in conjunction with Herbert Augustus Strong in 1882, but afterwards revised and issued under his own name. Trinity College, Dublin, gave him the degree of LL.D. The first Latin play and the first Greek tragedy to be performed in Australia were produced under his direction at Trinity College, Melbourne. Five of his students became bishops in the Anglican Church: J. Stretch and George Merrick Long (Newcastle, Australia), R. Stephen (Hobart), T. H. Armstrong (Wangaratta) and W. C. Sadlier (Nelson, New Zealand).
Personal life.
He was married twice (1) to Adeline Marian, daughter of Sir George Wigram Allen and (2) to Mary Elizabeth, daughter of F. G. Moule, who survived him with three sons and four daughters. Two of the sons had distinguished careers. The elder, Alexander Wigram Allen Leeper (1887-1935), born at Melbourne, educated at Melbourne Grammar School, the University of Melbourne and at Oxford, eventually entered the British Foreign Office and rose to be first secretary at H.M. legation at Vienna 1924-8, and counsellor 1933. He broke down under the strain of his work in 1934 and died in January 1935. He had nearly completed A History of Medieval Austria which was published by the Oxford University Press in 1941. His next brother, Reginald Wildig Allen Leeper, born at Sydney in 1888, and educated at Melbourne Grammar School and the universities of Melbourne and Oxford, also entered the foreign office and diplomatic service. He was first secretary at Warsaw, 1923-4; Riga, 1924; Constantinople, 1925; Warsaw, 1927-9; counsellor, 1933; C.M.G., 1936; assistant under-secretary, 1940; ambassador at the court of the King of the Hellenes, 1943; K.C.M.G. 1945; ambassador to Argentine Republic, 1946.
Valentine Leeper, Leeper's eldest child by his second marriage, became a classicist, teacher, polemicist (like her father), and letter-writer of renown.

McHale's Navy (1997 film)

"McHale's Navy" is a 1997 military comedy film starring Tom Arnold. The movie is based on the 1962-1966 television series of the same name. Ernest Borgnine was the only member of the original television show's cast to appear in the movie.
Plot.
The movie opens in the Caribbean, on the Island of San Moreno, where a trio of important looking men (a Chinese militant, a Russian General, and a European businessman) are meeting with the island's governor. After paying him a suitcase full of money for a special operation, the three men are joined, via helicopter, by Major Vladakov (Tim Curry), the second best terrorist in the world, who will be in charge of the operation. This entire event is witnessed by a young boy named Roberto who takes pictures of the governor, the Major, and his men.
The next morning finds retired Lt. Commander Quinton McHale (Tom Arnold) making his way to the Naval base of San Ysidro, where he does some trading with the officers. Such goods and services include selling home-brewed beer, ice cream, and swimsuit calendars to the men of the San Ysidro Naval Base in exchange for things like medicine and satellite photos to help out the people of San Moreno. The satellite photos are actually his way of spying on the opposing baseball team. Stationed at the base are his old crew. Virgil, a cigar-chomping ladies man and gunner. Happy, the team lookout who lives in a treehouse. Willie, the team techie and moonshine maker. Gruber, a slightly portly card-player and cigar horder. And Christy, the group's musclehead who can unscrew a beer bottle with his eye.
However, the base is now commanded by newly arrived Captain Wallace B. Binghampton (Dean Stockwell) and Lieutenant Penelope Carpenter (Debra Messing). Capt. Binghampton believes his men have gone native and confiscates all of the products McHale has sold them. He wants to resurrect his career after having mistakenly sunk a luxury cruise liner, for which he is famously known.
Vladakov takes control of the baseball field and beach on San Moreno to set up his base of operations. After Roberto inadvertently alerts Vladakov to McHale's presence, (mostly thanks to the jersey that McHale gave him and the team), Vladakov uses his new stealth boat to blow up McHale's home and nearly destroys his PT-73, a PT Boat, which reveals that they have a rather bad history with each other. When the governor tells Vladakov that his operations are disrupting the lives of the villagers, Vladakov and his men invade the village during their fiesta, blowing it up, and displacing everyone that lived there.
At the Pentagon, Cobra (Ernest Borgnine), who is a Naval Admiral, finds out about Vladakov's presence on San Moreno and instructs Binghampton to stand down in favor of McHale, revealing that he was once a top covert-operative. This shocks Binghampton, but he relays the message to McHale. Unfortunately, McHale rejects the mission, saying he wants nothing to do with it, or with Binghampton. However, upon learning that the village was destroyed, McHale accepts the assignment with the stipulations that he be given his old crew, men stationed at San Ysidro, and complete autonomy from Binghampton. Binghampton appears to agree but enlists Ensign Charles Parker (David Alan Grier) to spy on McHale. Slowly both Parker and Carpenter realize that Binghampton is an incompetent officer.
McHale sets up a camp site for the villagers and, after invading Vladakov's base to find out what's going on, heads to Cuba for supplies to fix the PT-73 and to combat Vladakov. McHale and his crew use a pirated variety show broadcast to prevent Vladakov from stealing missile launch codes and entertain the villagers. Binghampton, tired of sitting on the side lines, attempts an attack on Vladakov's base but upon arrival, it is vacated and shown to be a front. Vladakov has killed the men that hired him to blow up The Pentagon as his motives are finally revealed. He was monitoring communications between McHale and Cobra and is aware that Cobra is en route to San Moreno to help take out Vladakov. Vladakov attempts to kill Cobra using his stealth boat. Roberto is aboard and he tries to short out the boat to no avail. He is captured by Vladakov, but manages to jump ship. After Ensign Parker saves Roberto, McHale successfully kills Vladakov using a torpedo he bought in Cuba, as revenge for Vladakov killing Roberto's father in Panama. Cobra lands safely and reveals that he is McHale's father, none other than now Admiral Quinton McHale, Sr. Finally, the film ends with the commendations of McHale's crew, and the promotions of Lt. Carpenter and Ensign Parker, the US Navy rebuilding the baseball field, McHale re-retiring so that he may pursue a relationship with Carpenter, and Binghampton's apparent demotion to umpire for a kids' baseball game.
Reception.
The film received largely negative reviews from critics and was a bomb at the box office, grossing only $4.5 million in ticket sales. "McHale's Navy" was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Remake or Sequel, losing to "". It maintains a 3% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Urayuli

Urayuli, or "Hairy Men", are a mythical race of creatures that live in the woodland areas of southwestern Alaska. Stories of the Urayuli describe them as standing 10 feet tall with long shaggy fur and luminescent eyes. They are said to emit a high pitch cry, resembling that of a loon. Their long, lanky arms have been described as reaching down to their ankles. 
Rumored to live in the forests near the area of Lake Iliamna, the Urayuli are said to be peaceful creatures, unlike the Kushtaka of Southeastern Alaska.
It is said the Urayuli are transformed children who become lost in the woods at night. It is possible that this tale was started to keep children indoors at night.

"Keep Me Warm" (original Finnish title "Älä mene pois" - "Don't Go Away") was the Finnish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1974, performed in English by Carita.
The song was performed first on the night (preceding the United Kingdom's Olivia Newton-John with "Long Live Love"). At the close of voting, it had received 4 points, placing 13th in a field of 17.
The song is sung from the perspective of a young woman asking a "friend" to stay with her and "keep me warm". She suggests that she can do the same for him, and there is a general implication that she wants there to be a relationship between the two of them.
It was succeeded as Finnish representative at the 1975 Contest by Pihasoittajat with "Old Man Fiddle".

Junaluska

Junaluska, (Cherokee: "Tsunu’lahun’ski") (c.1775 – October 20, 1868), was a leader of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians who reside in and around western North Carolina. He fought alongside Andrew Jackson, and saved his life, at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, though later in life he regretted having done so.
Name and noms de guerre.
Junaluska was born around 1775, approximately south of Franklin, North Carolina near present day Dillard, Georgia. A few days after his birth, he was given his original name when the cradle-board holding him fell over. He was called "Gu-Ka-Las-Ki" or "Gulkalaski" in the Cherokee language, ("one who falls from a leaning position"). Later, after an unsuccessful military venture, he was named "Tsu-Na-La-Hun-Ski" or "Tsunulahunski" ("one who tries but fails"). Junaluska's own description of the event that gave him the name was ""Detsinulahungu"" (meaning "I tried, but could not").
Allies and enemies.
Oral tradition has it that Junaluska met with Tecumseh in Soco Gap in 1811 although this is not verified. Junaluska however sent word at least to Tecumseh that the Cherokee would not join an Indian confederacy against the whites.
In 1813 when the Cherokee raised up 636 men against the Red Stick faction of the Creek Indians in Alabama, Junaluska personally recruited over a hundred men to fight at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. The Cherokee unit was incorporated into the combined Creek-Cherokee-Yuchi-Choctaw army under the command of Brig. General William McIntosh, a "friendly" Creek from Georgia. Junaluska's actions turned the tide when he swam the Tallapoosa River retrieving Redstick canoes and ferrying the Cherokee to the rear of the Creeks. He is also credited with saving Andrew Jackson's life during this battle.
According to the provisions of an 1819 treaty with the United States, Junaluska applied for of land at Sugar Creek near Franklin, North Carolina. When his land was usurped by white settlers, he moved to the remaining portion of the Cherokee Nation.
Contention with Jackson.
It was reported that Jackson met with Junaluska regarding the Indian Removal Act, but the president said, "Sir, your audience is ended. There is nothing I can do for you," and when Junaluska saw his people being removed, he cried and looked toward the sky saying, "Oh my God, if I had known at the battle of the Horse Shoe what I know now, American history would have been differently written".
During the infamous Trail of Tears in 1838, Junaluska and many other Cherokee people were incarcerated and held in nearby stockades. One, known as Fort Montgomery, was located near present day Robbinsville, North Carolina. From this stockade, Junaluska was forced to march to Indian Territory in present day Eastern Oklahoma Junaluska was assigned to Jesse Bushyhead's detachment.
About seven weeks into the journey, Junaluska deserted and led approximately 50 other Cherokee. He was soon captured and returned to Oklahoma but after several years Junaluska made the trip back to North Carolina on foot. In 1847, after a plea by Col. William Holland Thomas, the state legislature rewarded him for his service by making him a citizen and giving him land near present-day Robbinsville.
Personal life.
Junaluska married "Ni-suh" and had three children, boys "Jim-my" and "Sic-que-yuh", and dauhter "Na-lih".
Junaluska died October 20, 1868 and was buried in Robbinsville. His grave was originally marked, in traditional Cherokee style, with a pile of stones, but in 1910 the General Joseph Winston Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution (Winston-Salem) erected a monument at his gravesite. A museum and memorial stands in his honor at this location.
Legacy.
Junaluska has been memorialized by Lake Junaluska, Junaluska Creek, Junaluska Gap, Junaluska Ridge, the Junaluska Salamander, and Mount Junaluska (now known as North Eaglenest Mountain).

National Weather Service bulletin for New Orleans region

The National Weather Service bulletin for the New Orleans region of 10:11 a.m., August 28, 2005 was a vividly worded release issued by the local Weather Forecast Office in Slidell, Louisiana, warning of the devastation that the Gulf Coast of the United States could experience as a result of Hurricane Katrina. 
A NWS assessment of its Hurricane Katrina activity found that because of "the unprecedented detail and foreboding nature of the language used, the statement helped
reinforce the actions of emergency management officials as they coordinated one of the largest evacuations in U.S. history." The bulletin "helped reinforce the message from emergency management officials for residents in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi to heed evacuation orders from local officials."
Background.
On the evening of August 25, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane near the Miami-Dade–Broward county line in southern Florida and weakened into a tropical storm as a result. The next morning, after passing over the state, Tropical Storm Katrina moved into the Gulf of Mexico, reintensified back to hurricane strength, and due to the warm waters of the Loop Current, began undergoing rapid deepening.
At 11:00 p.m. EDT August 26, approximately 56 hours before Katrina's landfall near Buras, Louisiana, the National Hurricane Center had predicted that the Greater New Orleans area could face a direct hit by the storm. As New Orleans is located on the Mississippi River Delta and parts of the city are below sea level, a strong hurricane could have a devastating effect on the city. Previous warnings, such as the one made by the Houston Chronicle in 2001, told of a disaster that "would strand 250,000 people or more, and probably kill one of 10 left behind as the city drowned under 20 feet of water" following a severe hurricane making landfall on the city. The National Hurricane Center's director, Max Mayfield, indicated that the Mississippi/Louisiana area has "the greatest potential for nightmare scenarios," and that this has been known for at least the three decades he has worked at the NHC. Other publications, such as "Popular Mechanics", "Scientific American", and The Times-Picayune gave doomsday scenarios in which a sinking city would drown and its residents would be left homeless.
In 1965, Hurricane Betsy made landfall just south of New Orleans, causing widespread flooding in the city. As a result, a system of levees was authorized by Congress to handle future storm events. However, the protection given by this system was limited to hurricanes up to Category 3 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.
Three days before Katrina's second and third landfalls, the National Hurricane Center began predicting that the storm would make landfall as a major hurricane. By the next morning, on August 27, the NHC issued a hurricane watch that included the New Orleans metro area, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning by 10:00 p.m. CDT that same evening. At this point, Katrina was a Category 3 hurricane with 115 mph (185 km/h) winds and about 335 miles (540 km) to the south-southeast of the Mississippi River's mouth.
Bulletin text.
On the night of August 27, Katrina underwent another episode of rapid deepening, strengthening to a Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph (280 km/h) by 10:00 am CDT on August 28. A few minutes later, at 10:11 a.m. CDT (1511 UTC), Robert Ricks, a meteorologist with the New Orleans/Baton Rouge NWS office, issued the following statement as part of the event synopsis text of an inland hurricane wind warning being issued:
An equally-explicit bulletin was repeated at 4:13 p.m. CDT.
Impact.
In the months following the storm, Congress appointed a bipartisan committee to investigate the response to Hurricane Katrina and the preparations prior to its landfall. The committee concluded that the forecasts given by the National Weather Service were timely, were not responsible for failures in other agencies, and were likely responsible for saving thousands of lives.
During an internal assessment by the National Weather Service, the 10:11 bulletin and its impact were analyzed. The report called the bulletin "a significant moment for the NWS during Katrina," as its detailed and explicit language did not have any previous precedent (though the message was based on a template designed by the Tampa Weather Office in the 1990s). The strongly worded statement urged residents to evacuate, and was highlighted by national news media. As a result, the level of detail was highlighted as an "innovative best practice" in the NWS assessment, which recommended issuing warnings with similar levels of detail in the future. The bulletin was described as "perhaps the most chilling ever issued" by the NWS. 
Ricks, a native of the Ninth Ward, later told NBC Nightly News that he wrote the bulletin based on his experiences with Betsy and Camille. He also said that he was looking for statements to take out, but decided to leave the bulletin more or less intact because it seemed valid for a storm that he was convinced would be "the big one" longtime New Orleans residents had been predicting for some time. He admitted that he and his colleagues hoped to have been wrong about just how powerful Katrina would become, "but our local expertise said otherwise." He added, "We always prepare for the big one, we just didn't think it was going to come this soon."

Survivor Series (2007)

Survivor Series (2007) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which took place on November 18, 2007 at the American Airlines Arena in Miami, Florida. It was presented by THQ's "WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008". It was the 21st annual Survivor Series and starred wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown!, and ECW brands.
The show's seven matches showcased prominent WWE wrestlers, who acted out the franchise's stories in and out of the ring. The main event featured SmackDown wrestlers in a Hell in a Cell match, in which the ring was surrounded by a roofed steel structure. In this match, World Heavyweight Champion Batista defeated The Undertaker to retain his title. In Raw's main match, Randy Orton defeated Shawn Michaels in a singles match, while in ECW's prime match, ECW Champion CM Punk defeated John Morrison and The Miz in a Triple Threat match to retain the title. Two matches were on the undercard. The first was a singles match, in which The Great Khali defeated Hornswoggle. The other featured Team Triple H (Triple H, Jeff Hardy, Rey Mysterio and Kane) defeating Team Umaga (Umaga, Mr. Kennedy, Montel Vontavious Porter, Finlay and Big Daddy V) in an inter-brand five-on-four Survivor Series elimination tag team match.
Survivor Series helped WWE increase its pay-per-view revenue by $1.2 million, through ticket sales and pay-per-view buys. It received mixed critical reviews by various independent sources, including Canadian Online Explorer and the Pro Wrestling Torch. After its release on DVD, the event peaked at number five on "Billboard"'s Video Sales chart, before it fell off the chart after ten weeks.
Background.
Survivor Series was the culmination of various scripted plots and storylines. For three months before the event, several professional wrestling matches and scripted plots were played out on WWE programming ("Raw", "Friday Night SmackDown!", and "ECW on Sci Fi") to create feuds between various wrestlers, casting them as villains and heroes. Raw, SmackDown!, and ECW were also the names of WWE's televised brands – a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a specific program, thus each brand promoted distinct matches.
The main narrative for Survivor Series from the SmackDown brand continues the events that unfolded at WrestleMania 23, WWE's April pay-per-view, in which The Undertaker defeated Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship. Over the course of several months, the two wrestlers fought in various matches over the title, which eventually involved Edge. The Undertaker was billed as having been injured in one of these matches in May, in which Edge had won the title. During The Undertaker's absence, Edge was legitimately injured, and The Great Khali won the championship in a Battle Royal, in which wrestlers were eliminated until one remained as the winner. At Unforgiven, WWE's September pay-per-view event, The Undertaker returned to WWE, while Batista won the World Heavyweight Title from The Great Khali. Afterwards, the original feud between the two wrestlers was restarted and culminated into a standard wrestling match, known in professional wrestling as a singles match, at WWE's October pay-per-view event Cyber Sunday; Batista won this match and retained his title. On the November 2, 2007 episode of "Friday Night SmackDown!", a rematch was advertised in a Hell in a Cell match, in which both wrestlers would fight in a ring surrounded by a roofed steel structure at Survivor Series.
The prime rivalry scripted from the Raw brand continued a storyline that extended from Cyber Sunday, between WWE Champion Randy Orton and Shawn Michaels over Orton's title. At Cyber Sunday, Michaels was chosen by the WWE fans, via online voting, to face Orton for the title, though, Orton retained his title via disqualification. A rematch was promoted for Survivor Series on the October 29, 2007 edition of "Raw", in which Michaels would face Orton for his title. Afterwards, Michaels and Orton fought in different match types over the weeks leading to Survivor Series. On the episode of "Raw" before Survivor Series, Michaels and Orton met "Face to Face" in a scripted confrontation, in which Orton attacked Michaels.
The prime storyline on the ECW brand featured ECW Champion CM Punk, John Morrison, and The Miz. Morrison and Punk's rivalry revolved over the outcome of their match at , WWE's June pay-per-view event, in which Morrison defeated Punk to win the ECW Title. Punk sought revenge, but Morrison defeated Punk in two championship matches; however, Punk won the title from Morrison on the September 4, 2007 episode of "ECW on Sci fi". At Cyber Sunday, The Miz was voted online by fans to challenge Punk for the ECW Title, though, Punk defeated Miz to retain his title. A Triple Threat match was announced for Survivor Series on the November 13, 2007 episode of "ECW on Sci-Fi", in which Punk would defend his title against Morrison and Miz, and the first wrestler to gain a pinfall or submission would win the match and the title.
In a narrative extending to the September 10, 2007 episode of "Raw", in which Hornswoggle, a dwarf, was announced as Vince McMahon's illegitimate son. In this storyline, McMahon did not like the fact that Hornswoggle was his son, and as a result, he promoted matches in which Hornswoggle faced much larger opponents. As part of this storyline, McMahon announced that The Great Khali, who was billed as standing at , would face Hornswoggle at Survivor Series. In a promotional in-ring segment on the episode of "Friday Night SmackDown!" before the pay-per-view event, Khali and Hornswoggle weighed in for their match, in which Khali weighed double the weight of Hornswoggle; this was a segment created by McMahon to humiliate his son. As a Survivor Series tradition, every event features an inter-brand 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination tag team match. Announced via WWE.com, WWE's official website, Team Triple H (Triple H, The Hardys (Matt and Jeff), Rey Mysterio, and Kane would face Team Umaga (Umaga, Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP), Finlay, Big Daddy V, and Mr. Kennedy).
Event.
Preliminary matches.
The pay-per-view began with the ECW Championship Triple Threat match, in which CM Punk defended his title against John Morrison and The Miz. Throughout the match,The Miz and Morrison double-teamed Punk, however, Miz turned his back on Morrison by attacking him. After Miz tossed Morrison over the top ring ropes onto ringside, Punk lifted Miz onto his shoulders and hit the Go To Sleep. He then pinned Miz to retain his ECW Title.
The next scheduled match was an inter-brand 10-Diva tag team match, in which the team of Kelly Kelly, Torrie Wilson, Mickie James, Maria, and Michelle McCool faced Victoria, Beth Phoenix, Melina, Layla, and Jillian Hall. Phoenix's team had the advantage over James' team, until James was tagged into the match. She attacked Melina with her forearm and kissed her before kicking her in the head. James then pinned her to earn the victory for her team. Next was a tag team match for the World Tag Team Championship, in which the champions, Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch defended against Hardcore Holly and Cody Rhodes. At one point, Holly hit Cade with his forearm, and sent Cade and himself onto ringside. In the ring, Murdoch flipped over Rhodes' back and pulled him down to the mat to perform the "Ace of Spades". Successfully pinning Rhodes, Murdoch retained the World Tag Team Championship for his team.
The fourth match was the five-on-five Survivor Series Elimination Tag team match between Team Triple H and Team Umaga. Before the event, it was announced that Matt Hardy would be unable to compete in the match due to a scripted injury. Kane was the first wrestler eliminated off of Team Triple H, after a Big Daddy V elbow drop. Umaga then pinned Rey Mysterio after the "Samoan Spike". Only Jeff and Triple H remained for their team, while MVP was Team Umaga's first elimination ; Jeff Hardy eliminated him after a "Twist of Fate". Team Umaga's second elimination occurred after Big Daddy V accidentally dropped an elbow on Mr. Kennedy, which led to a pinfall by Triple H. Big Daddy V was Team Umaga's third elimination, which occurred after Hardy and Triple H hit a Double DDT. Finlay and Umaga were then eliminated via pinfall, after a "Pedigree" to Finlay, and a "Swanton" to Umaga. As a result, Team Triple H won. The Great Khali versus Hornswoggle was the next scheduled match. At one point, Hornswoggle tried to hit Khali with a shillelagh, but Khali slapped Hornswoggle down to the mat. The match ended via disqualification, after Finlay, Hornswoggle original caretaker, entered the ring and hit Khali in the head with his own shillelagh.
Main event matches.
The sixth match was Raw's main match, in which Randy Orton faced Shawn Michaels for Orton's WWE Championship. In this stipulated match, Michaels was banned from using his signature move, "Sweet Chin Music", while Orton was unable to get disqualified, and if either man broke those stipulations he would have lost the WWE Championship match. Because Michaels was banned from using the superkick, his signature maneuver, Michaels attempted various submission moves, such as the Sharpshooter, Crossface, and ankle lock. Eventually, Michaels, attempted to perform his superkick, but to prevent himself from losing the match, he stopped, which then allowed Orton to hit an RKO. Successfully pinning Michaels, Orton retained his WWE Title.
The main event from SmackDown was the event's final match, in which World Heavyweight Champion Batista defended his title against The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match. At one point, Batista hit the The Undertaker with a Batista Bomb through a table. Batista then attempted to pin The Undertaker but he only got a two count. The Undertaker then hit Batista with a Tombstone Piledriver. He pinned Batista but Batista kicked out at two. The Undertaker then hit another Tombstone Piledriver on top of the steel ring steps. The Undertaker pinned Batista, and as the referee counted the pin, Edge, dressed as a cameraman, pulled the referee out of the ring, and hit The Undertaker with the camera he was holding and then positioned Undertaker's head on top of the steel steps. Edge then slammed a folding chair across the back of The Undertaker's head. While the referee re-entered the ring, Edge dragged Batista onto The Undertaker, and as a result, Batista pinned The Undertaker and retained his World Heavyweight Title. After the match Edge came back into the ring and struck The Undertaker in the head as he was sitting up.
Aftermath.
After Survivor Series, Randy Orton was scripted into a feud with Chris Jericho, who made his return to WWE after a two-year hiatus. The following night on "Raw", the evolving feud culminated into a match being promoted for Armageddon, WWE's December pay-per-view. At Armageddon, Orton retained his WWE Title. After Batista retained his World Heavyweight Championship, Edge was scripted into a rivalry with him over his title. Eventually, The Undertaker was also placed in feud, which led to the advertising of a Triple Threat match at Armageddon for the title. At Armageddon, Edge won the World Heavyweight Championship. Due to the events that occurred at Survivor Series, a match was announced between Finlay and The Great Khali for Armageddon. Finlay prevailed at Armageddon via pinning The Great Khali. After remaining as the sole survivors in their Elimination tag team match, Triple H and Jeff Hardy were promoted into a match for Armageddon, in which the winner would win the opportunity to challenge for the WWE Championship. At Armageddon, Hardy defeated Triple H. Because Beth Phoenix and Mickie James were the leaders of their teams at Survivor Series, a feud evolved from this, which culminated into a match at Armageddon over Phoenix's WWE Women's Championship. Phoenix retained her title at Armageddon.
Reception.
The American Airlines Arena usually has a capacity of 19,600, which was reduced for Survivor Series due to production purposes. From an approximate attendance of 12,000 and 341,000 pay-per-view buys, Survivor Series helped WWE earn $19.9 million in pay-per-view revenue versus $18.7 million the previous year; this was confirmed by WWE in its 2007 fourth quarter financial report. Although Survivor Series helped WWE's revenue, it earned 42,000 less buys than the previous year's Survivor Series.
In addition, the pay-per-view received mixed reviews. Dale Plummer and Nick Tylwalk of Canadian Online Explorer's "SLAM! Sports – Wrestling" rated the entire event 7.5 out of 10 points. They also rated Raw and SmackDown's main event an 8 out of 10 points. J.D. Dunn of 411Mania stated that the event was "The best WWE PPV since Backlash." Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch, a professional wrestling newsletter operated since 1987, reported that the main event was "disappointing" and that "WWE set expectations too high for the Cell." He rated the Raw main event 3 out of 5 points, while rating the SmackDown main event 2.25 out of 5 points. Survivor Series was released on DVD on December 26, 2007 by WWE Home Video, and it was distributed by Genius Products. The DVD debuted on "Billboard's" Video Sales chart on January 19, 2008 at number five. It spent nine more weeks on the chart, before it fell off the chart at number 20.

Lapponia (song)

"Lapponia" was the Finnish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1977, performed in Finnish by Monica Aspelund.
The song was performed sixteenth on the night, following Italy's Mia Martini with "Libera" and preceding Belgium's Dream Express with "A Million in One, Two, Three". At the close of voting, it had received 50 points, placing 10th in a field of 18.
Despite its moderate placing at the Eurovision final, "Lapponia" was given release in twenty European countries and also in Australia, Brazil, Israel and Turkey. Aspelund recorded "Lapponia" in six languages; Finnish, her mother tongue Swedish, English, German, French and Dutch. "Lapponia" afforded Aspelund a #5 hit in Finland and also reached #5 in Sweden. 
The successive Finnish representative at the 1978 Contest by Seija Simola was "Anna rakkaudelle tilaisuus". In 1983 Monica Aspelund's sister Ami entered the contest with the song "Fantasiaa".
"Lapponia" was included on the double-disc sets of "Winners and Classics" produced to commemorate the "Congratulations" special of late 2005. This is in spite of the song placing substantially lower than Marion Rung's "Tom Tom Tom" of 1973 - at the time the CDs were made, Finland's highest Contest finish. As the liner notes indicate that it is a "distinctly Finnish" song, the argument can be made that Rung's Anglophone song was not quite as Finnish.
The band Northern Kings covered this song.

The Golden Cage (TV series)

De Gouden Kooi (The Golden Cage) was the original concept and working title for Big Brother. In 2006, it was revived and turned into another format of reality television.
The idea for "De Gouden Kooi" was born on 4 September 1997 during a brainstorm session at the "John de Mol Produkties" production house, an independent branch of Endemol. Participants were John de Mol himself, Patrick Scholtze, Bart Römer and his brother Paul Römer. After John de Mol left Endemol he reintroduced the original format for his TV-station Talpa.
Synopsis.
The first Dutch episode on 23 September 2006 had slightly fewer than 1 million viewers (10-15% market share, it was programmed right after the Dutch Eredivisie football show, which always attracts many viewers); the two subsequent episodes received around 500,000 viewers (5-10% market share). Thereafter, the audience dropped to about 350,000The setting was a €2 million capital villa in Eemnes. After a few months the uglier sides of the participants came to light. A lot of "millionaires" were constantly plotting how to get rid of the others. Natasia, who had left behind her two young kids, refused to return home when her boyfriend who cared for them asked her to. She wanted to reach her goals first: a boob job and a drivers license. One participant regularly ordered the use of (masked) prostitutes. Some participants started (loveless) sexual relationships, which led to jealousy and much verbal abuse. Another contestant, Nena, had to be disqualified on 2 February 2007 after she kicked another participant's leg. 2 days later, Nathanael kicked Huub and they both got into a fight. After much discussion between the directors, Huub got back into the house because he didn't physically attack Nathanael. On 30 November 2007, "miljonaire" Dennis was about to be voted off by all of the other contestants in the house and would not be replaced by another contestant, during the vote, Dennis grabbed a chair and demolished a camera in the house, causing him to be disqualified, but also so he would be replaced with another "millionaire"[http://www.telegraaf.nl/prive/2696739/_Geklooi_in_Gouden_Kooi__.html?pageNumber=2.
Format.
The housemates will live in a villa, just as in the original series. However if contestant's lose weekly challenges the housemates with the lowest points will face elimination which will be decided by the contestants.
Each week someone is eliminated and the housemates pick someone to leave the prize money will rise.
Criticism.
The concept has been heavily criticized. Because there are no nominations or votings off like in Big Brother, psychologists assume that harassment and bullying will be the only ways of getting rid of one's rivals and obtaining the reward. This would provide a very wrong role model for the youth of the Netherlands. Murray Stone therefore promised to introduce a "bully referee". The producers rather expect that housemates will leave if they experience homesickness or family-complications will occur (death, birth or sickness).

Bus services in Hong Kong

Bus services in Hong Kong have a long history. As of 2005, five companies operate franchised public bus services. There are also a variety of non-franchised public buses services, including feeder bus services to railway stations operated by MTR, and residents' services for residential estates (particularly those in the New Territories).
Current situation.
The bus service of Hong Kong can be roughly divided into 3 types: Franchised bus, Non-franchised bus and Public light bus.
Franchised bus.
As of 2007, there are 5 privately owned bus companies that provide franchised bus service across Hong Kong, operating more than 700 routes. Hong Kong is one of the few cities in the world that has no publicly operated bus service.
These are the five franchised bus companies in Hong Kong:
Mainly provides service in Kowloon and New Territories, operating total 402 routes. Some of them are cross-harbour routes.
Mainly provides service on Hong Kong Island, operating 154 routes. 72 routes are on Hong Kong Island, 32 of them are North-Lantau and Airport routes, and the final 50 of the routes are cross-harbour routes. Other than those, Citybus operates shuttle routes B3, B3A and B3X between Tuen Mun and Shenzhen Bay Port.
Mainly services Tung Chung, Disneyland Resort and routes shuttling between the Airport and New Territories.
Mainly provides service on Hong Kong Island, and provides routes in Kowloon and Tseung Kwan O. It operates some cross-harbour routes.
Mainly provides service on Lantau Island, operating a total of 20 routes.
Founded in 1933, the Kowloon Motor Bus Company (1933) Limited (KMB) is one of the largest privately owned public bus operators in the world. KMB's fleet consists of 4,058 buses on 402 routes and a staff of over 12,000. In 1979, Citybus began its operation in Hong Kong with one double-decker, providing shuttle service for the Hong Kong dockyard. It later expanded into operating a residential bus route between City One, Shatin and Kowloon Tong MTR station. New World First Bus Services Limited (NWFB) was established in 1998, taking over China Motor Bus's franchise to provide bus services on Hong Kong Island together with Citybus. NWFB's parent company later bought Citybus, but the two companies have basically been operating independently.
Hong Kong franchised bus routes have a fixed path, fare, service hours and schedule. Urban routes mostly operate with double-decker buses, which have become a distinguishing feature of Hong Kong. Passengers are required to pay their bus fare when they board the bus, and all buses accept payment by either Octopus card or cash however no change is given for paying by the latter. Some routes such as cross-harbour routes and Disneyland Resort routes are operated jointly by two companies. Fares are dependent more on where a passenger boards rather than alights and cross-harbour services cost close to HKD10 when the bus has yet to cross the harbour.
Non-franchised buses.
The non-franchised bus services of Hong Kong are provided by different private bus companies as a means to relieve the demand on franchised buses and green public minibuses in rush hour. They also serve some remote places which are deemed non-profitable for franchised bus and green public minibus operators to serve. According to the Transport Department, there were 8111 registered non-franchised buses in Hong Kong as of 13 March 2014. Generally speaking, the services are divided into the following categories:
On the other hand, MTR Corporation also operates some feeder bus routes in Tuen Mun, Tin Shui Wai and Yuen Long to complement its West Rail Line and Light Rail services. Although MTR Bus is classified as a non-franchised buses operator, it is entitled to certain privileges and obligations similar to franchised buses, e.g. retirement age limit of buses (18 year) and tax-free petrol.
Public light buses.
The public light buses in Hong Kong are passenger transport vehicles (minibuses) with a capacity of 16 passengers. The capacity was 14 before the 1980s. They provide feeder services to buses and the railway. According to the law, there can only be 4350 minibuses. They can be divided into two types: red public minibuses and green public minibuses. Other kinds of light bus services, for example, the Nanny van transports provided by such van owners during the 1980s are considered illegal beyond their operation routes.

Anna rakkaudelle tilaisuus

"Anna rakkaudelle tilaisuus" ("Give love a chance") was the Finnish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1978, performed in Finnish by Seija Simola.
The song was performed fourth on the night, following Italy's Ricchi e Poveri with "Questo amore" and preceding Portugal's Gemini with "Dai li dou". At the close of voting, it had received two points, placing 18th in a field of twenty.
The song is sung to a boy growing up. Simola tells him that, while everything in the world seems new and exciting at the moment, it will soon seem not so. Thus, he must learn to "give love a chance" in order to remain positive. Simola also recorded the song in English under that title; "Give Love a Chance".
It was succeeded as Finnish representative at the 1979 Contest by Katri Helena with "Katson sineen taivaan".

Park Central Mall

Park Central Mall was the first shopping mall in Phoenix, Arizona, It is located in Encanto Village, on Central Avenue and Osborn Road. 
Today it exists as a mixed-use, business park primarily occupied by regional administrative offices for Catholic Healthcare West, and regional offices for UnitedHealth Group. The property currently is known simply as Park Central.
History.
Park Central Shopping City, as it originally was known, was first envisioned by Ralph Burgbacher and his older brother, A.J. Burgbacher. The two men purchased the Central Avenue Dairy in the 1950s. At the time Phoenix was a much smaller city, and the mall's location, north of the state capitol was an early edge city, which in time came to be known as "Uptown" Phoenix. Other developers criticized the brothers, believing a development out in the "dairy farm" area was futile, but development proceeded and the open-air mall was completed in 1957. When the mall opened, the primary anchors were a twin-level Goldwater's, twin-level Diamond's, and a J.J. Newberry five and dime store. Goldwater's and Diamond's soon closed their older, downtown stores favoring their new midtown location in the mall. When J.C. Penney closed its downtown location in the mid-1960s, the downtown area never would regain its status as the retail draw it once was. The original Phoenix-based Playboy club was across Central Ave. to the East; it closed in the mid-1980s. 
As Phoenix quickly grew, the area around Park Central Mall saw an increasing number of mid-rise and 
high-rise office buildings built along Central Avenue, and eventually became known as the central business district. Part of this mid-1960s transition included the new addition of a twin level J.C. Penney store at the mall, and a covered parking deck on the northeast end of the property, to help combat the hot summertime temperatures.
Unable to compete with newer enclosed shopping malls, Park Central, still an open-air facility, had lost most of its major retailers by the very late 1980s. The first major anchor to leave was Robinson's, which had purchased and converted the Goldwater's store years earlier, closing the location down just before the end of the decade. The second major anchor to leave was J.C. Penney, closing just at the start of the 1990s. Finally the last anchor, Dillard's, which had purchased and converted Diamond's a few years prior, became a discount Dillard's Clearance Center and remained open in that format until the mid-1990s.
Conversion of the property began shortly after the last anchor closed and most vacant retail space was converted to leaseable office space. The Diamond's space at the west / back end of the old mall became the Arizona regional offices for Catholic Healthcare West, parent company of St. Joseph's Hospital located on an adjacent property. Banner Health Systems soon moved some administrative functions into what was Goldwater's, and finally the old J.C. Penney space became offices for UnitedHealth Group. The remaining smaller retail spaces began to fill with nearly a dozen small restaurants mostly located at the east/front end of the old mall (including Starbucks Coffee, Jamba Juice and Qdoba Mexican Grill). Other smaller businesses, such as a flower shop, a shoe repair shop, a vitamin/health supplements store, the primary customer care call center for cable service provider Cable One and a branch location of Wells Fargo Financial, occupy the remaining storefronts. A Hampton Inn hotel location sits on the southwest corner of the property adjacent to the Catholic Healthcare West offices. 
Nearly all the mall's original buildings still stand, and most have only cosmetic changes.
Light Rail.
Park Central Mall has its own "Central at Osborn / Midtown Station" stop on the Valley Metro Light Rail system.

<doc id="5973604" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5973604" title="In-camera editing">
In-camera editing

In-Camera Editing is a technique where, instead of editing the shots in a film into sequence after shooting, the cinematographer instead shoots the sequences in strict order. The resulting 'edit' is therefore already complete when the film is developed.
The process takes a lot of planning so that the shots are filmed in the precise order they will be presented. However, some of this time can be reclaimed, as there is no editing, cutting out or reordering scenes later on. When the very last scene is filmed by the videographer, the production is completely finished.
A benefit of the technique, largely now irrelevant due to the rise of digital video, is a reduction in the cost of the production. When the cost of film was a significant fraction of the budget, film-makers used this technique to maximize film usage.
Because of its apparent simplicity, in-camera editing is also popular with new students who may lack experience with editing, or who want to skip the editing step. It can also be a very educational process because of time and organizational skills that are required. The discipline required to plan out each shot is a useful pedagogical technique. Many introductory video production courses cover the topic of in-camera editing for this very purpose.
Finally, if the film-maker does not have access to film editing equipment (notably, a non-linear editing system), then in-camera editing may be the only available option.
Notable Film Makers Who Have Used In-Camera Editing.
Alfred Hitchcock used the technique, notably in "Rope". Jean-Luc Godard also made use of it in his film "Breathless". Both of these men helped to create in-camera editing in films and led to the technological advancement of in-camera editing:

<doc id="5973607" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5973607" title="Fricket">
Fricket

Fricket or disc cricket is a disc game generally played by two teams of two players each (two-on-two), though it is possible to play one-on-one. The game is roughly derived from cricket (though in some ways having more in common with horseshoes), and played with flying discs. Fricket is also sometimes called catchy-throwy, cups or crispy wickets or stickupski. The name "fricket" is derived from a portmanteau of the words "Frisbee" (a trademarked flying disc brand name) and "cricket".
Equipment.
Fricket is a non-contact game, and therefore no protective equipment is necessary. Four 4- or -long wickets are needed for this game, though bamboo garden stakes, wooden dowels and steel or plastic rods also make suitable substitutes for wickets.
A 12-ounce plastic cup is needed to set atop each of the four wickets, along with a flying disc within the specifications for the disc game ultimate (sport).
Field.
The wickets are set into the ground in the shape of a long rectangle, with one pair approximately apart (or "a disc and a fist") and the second pair approximately away, directly opposite the first pair, with the field forming right angles at each corner.
Rules.
Each team stands behind a wicket pair and takes turns throwing the disc at the opposing wickets. The throwing team aims to do one of two things: knock the cups off by striking the wicket or cups with the disc or cleanly pass the disc between the two wickets below the level of the cups without making contact with either wicket. The team on defense cannot interfere with the throw and must stand behind the wickets. If a wicket is hit and a cup becomes airborne, the defense attempts to catch the cup using only one hand and not trapping the cup against the body. Points can be scored in a variety of ways.
Example scoring system:
To score points, the teams or individual take turns throwing the disc towards the sets of pipes. If the disc hits the ground or does not hit or go through the set of pipes, no points are awarded. If the disc hits the pipes, but the cup does not fall off, no points are awarded. If the disc hits the pipe and the cup becomes airborne, the point is up for grabs. If the cup hits the ground the throwing team is awarded a point, but if the cup is caught by the defending team before it hits the ground, the defending team is awarded a point. If the defending team interferes with the disc before it is past the pipes, the throwing team gets to throw again. If a cup is accidentally knocked off the pipe, the opposing team is awarded a point for each cup that touches the ground. Some rules stipulate that cups can only be caught with one hand and 'trapping' which is catching the disc between a hand and the body mean a point for the throwing team. Games are played to 11, and the teams switch positions after the first team reaches 6.

Legend (Tangerine Dream soundtrack)

Legend is a soundtrack album by the German band Tangerine Dream, released in 1986 for the North American theatrical version of the film "Legend", issued a year earlier in Europe. The film was written by William Hjortsberg, produced by Arnon Milchan, directed by Ridley Scott and released domestically by Universal Studios. The album was released on compact disc on 15 August 1995 through Varese Sarabande.
Background.
After a disappointing test screening with Jerry Goldsmith's original orchestral score, Scott decided to make changes to the film. Sidney Sheinberg, president of MCA (the parent company of Universal at the time), felt that the Goldsmith score would not appeal to the youth and pressed Scott for a new score. Tangerine Dream was contracted to complete a new, more contemporary score—-a job they completed in three weeks. Until 2002, only European audiences could see "Legend" with Goldsmith's score.
Versions.
Several bootleg versions of the album exist, and vary in cover artwork to track listing as well as song length and titles. Many of the bootleg editions feature around twice as many songs as the original soundtrack, including those that were omitted from the original, such as the opening "Prologue".
Tangerine Dream score.
"Loved by the Sun" is a vocal version of "Unicorn Theme" with lyrics written and sung by Jon Anderson of Yes. The vocals were added after Tangerine Dream had composed the instrumental music. It was originally recorded with vocals by Susanne Pawlitzki based on William Blake's poem "The Angel," but was rejected in favor of the Jon Anderson version. "Unicorn Theme" has been played live at several concerts in various versions. "Is Your Love Strong Enough?"--the song played over the end credits--has lyrics written and sung by Bryan Ferry with guitar by David Gilmour (of Pink Floyd fame) and bass by Guy Pratt. It is a former outtake of the recording sessions for "Avalon", the eighth and last Roxy Music album. All of the other tracks are Tangerine Dream instrumentals. "Is Your Love Strong Enough?" was also released as a 12" single which included an extended version of the same song as well as an instrumental; neither of these last two versions were included on the Avalon album.
Prologue.
Tangerine Dream had recorded another piece that did not appear on the official soundtrack, but did appear in the film. It has only been found in bootlegs, in MP3 form at some P2P sites, and also on some streaming services, particularly Rdio. Within both mediums, the song was given either the title "Prologue" or "Once Long Ago". This music can be heard in the intro to the American film release and is also heard in one of the early scenes between Jack and Lilly. It is recognized for its distinct and memorable flute melody. Additionally, some of this melody can be heard at the end of the song, "Loved by the Sun," as it fades out. It can be theorized that the band originally intended that outro to be the "epilogue," reprising the opening melody as a means of continuity - to end the story in the place where it began.
The reason for its exclusion from the official soundtrack album is unknown.
DVD isolated score.
"Legend: Ultimate Edition" was released on DVD in May 2002. One of the DVD options is to play the U.S. version with an isolated Tangerine Dream score. There is no music other than what had already been released on LP and CD, nor is there any dialogue or sound effects. Thus, the DVD plays with long silences in between the music.
Track listing.
The track order, for the most part, follows the order of appearance in the film, with the exception of two of the songs:
"Loved by the Sun," is heard during the film's final scene, and "Is Your Love Strong Enough?" is heard during the film's ending credits.
Tribute.
On June 12, 2012, composer Brandon K. Verrett released a cover album of the original soundtrack, containing 20 tracks of newly produced and re-recorded versions, including some tracks that were omitted from the original Tangerine Dream soundtrack. Unlike the Tangerine Dream soundtrack, which was made exclusively by electronic means, Verrett utilizes more 'organic' instruments, such as violins, cellos, and flutes, among others. The album was released with a limited pressing of 1,500.

Troy McLawhorn

William Troy McLawhorn (born November 4, 1968) is an American musician who has been the guitarist, backing vocalist and songwriting partner in the bands Evanescence, Seether, Dark New Day, doubleDrive, Still Rain and Gibraltar.
Early career.
He was formerly of the bands Seether, doubleDrive and Still Rain. After the demise of his first band, Still Rain, McLawhorn helped form doubleDrive in 1996 and landed a recording contract with MCA records in 1998. After scoring a top 20 hit at active rock radio with the song "Tattooed Bruise" with the help of program director Dick Shuetz at WJRR in Orlando, Fla. The band left MCA and signed a new deal with Roadrunner Records in 2001 and released their second album Blue In The Face with the song "Imprint" reaching into the top 20 also. McLawhorn was an active member until December 2003, when the band broke up. Upon the breakup of that band he along with Corey Lowery and Will Hunt began working on material together which would later become Dark New Day and would include good friends Clint Lowery and Brett Hestla. The lineup was one that had been hinted at years earlier. Dark New Day signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records in late 2004 and released the album 12 year silence which had the song "Brother" in 2005 which was a top 10 hit at active rock radio.
Evanescence.
In May 2007, McLawhorn was announced as the replacement for Evanescence's former guitarist John LeCompt, and played with the band through its "The Open Door" album tour, which ended in December 2007. He remained active with Dark New Day while playing with Evanescence. However, McLawhorn eventually left Dark New Day in mid-2008 after joining Seether as a touring guitarist. After the success of the subsequent tour, McLawhorn became the official lead guitarist of Seether.
From then until early March 2011, McLawhorn did various tours with Seether. He took part in recording with the band on projects such as "Seether iTunes Originals," "Rhapsody Originals," and on covers of Wham!'s "Careless Whisper" and Frank Sinatra's "I've Got You Under my Skin" as well. McLawhorn finished writing and recording with Seether on the album "Holding On To Strings Better Left To Fray." The first single "Country Song" which was co-written by McLawhorn was released in the United States on March 8, 2011 exclusively on iTunes.
On March 8, 2011 it was announced that Troy had left Seether to pursue other interests. Later that day McLawhorn responded on the official "The Troy McLawhorn Fan Site" on Facebook with the following statement:
"Thanks for all of the support. You guys are great! I really enjoyed playing and creating music with the guys and I wish that I didn't have to leave especially now that the album that we worked so hard on is finally coming out. It was a hard decision and I wish them the best. I hope that I will see all of you when I find my next project."
On April 8, 2011, Seether frontman Shaun Morgan took to his Twitter account to vent his frustrations regarding Troy's still unconfirmed new gig. The next day Troy took to his official Facebook page to release the following statement to explain his departure:
On June 12, 2011, Amy Lee of Evanescence announced on her Twitter account that Troy had officially rejoined the band for their upcoming tour and new album due out October 11, 2011.
Troy McLawhorn will fill in for Sevendust guitarist Clint Lowery on their upcoming tour with Coal Chamber. McLawhorn will join the band on March 27 though April.
Producer.
Evanescence finished their most recent world tour in November of 2012. Upon completion of that tour it was clear that it might be quite some time before the band would be active again. Knowing this McLawhorn decided to start building a parallel career in the music business as a record producer, songwriter and session player. His first project is currently underway with a christian artist named Skyler Truth who is from North Carolina also. 
Personal life.
Troy is married to Amy McLawhorn, and has a son named Michael.

POWER2

The POWER2, originally named RIOS2, is a processor designed by IBM that implemented the POWER instruction set architecture. The POWER2 was the successor of the POWER1, debuting in September 1993 within IBM's RS/6000 systems. When introduced, the POWER2 was the fastest microprocessor, surpassing the Alpha 21064. When the Alpha 21064A was introduced in 1993, the POWER2 lost the lead and became second. IBM claimed that the performance for a 62.5 MHz POWER2 was 73.3 SPECint92 and 134.6 SPECfp92.
The open source GCC compiler removed support for POWER1 (RIOS) and POWER2 (RIOS2) in the 4.5 release.
Description.
Improvements over the POWER1 included enhancements to the POWER instruction set architecture (consisting of new user and system instructions and other system-related features), higher clock rates (55 to 71.5 MHz), an extra fixed point unit and floating point unit, a larger 32 KB instruction cache, and a larger 128 or 256 KB data cache. The POWER2 was a multi-chip design consisting of six or eight semi-custom integrated circuits, depending on the amount of data cache (the 256 KB configuration required eight chips). The partitioning of the design was identical to that of the POWER1: an instruction cache unit chip, a fixed-point unit chip, a floating-point unit chip, a storage control unit chip, and two or four data cache unit chips.
The eight-chip configuration contains a total of 23 million transistors and a total die area of 1,215 mm2. The chips are manufactured by IBM in its 0.72 μm CMOS process, which features a 0.45 μm effective channel length; and one layer of polysilicon and four layers of metal interconnect. The chips are packaged in a ceramic multi-chip module that measures 64 mm by 64 mm.
POWER2+.
An improved version of the POWER2 optimized for transaction processing was introduced in May 1994 as the POWER2+. Transaction processing workloads benefited from the addition of a L2 cache with capacities of 512 KB, 1 MB and 2 MB. This cache was implemented off-package with industry-standard burst SRAMs. The cache was connected to the POWER2+ via a 64- (for low-end systems) or 128-bit bus (for high-end systems). The cache was direct-mapped, had a 128-byte line size, and was write-through. The cache tags were contained on the storage control unit chip. The POWER2+ has a narrower 64- or 128-bit memory bus and a smaller 64 or 128 KB data cache. As there is less cache, the data cache unit chips are smaller as a result, and the revised storage control unit chip is also smaller. A goal for the six-chip configuration was to reduce cost, and therefore the chips are packaged in a solder ball connect (SBC) package instead of a MCM.
P2SC.
The P2SC, for "POWER2 Super Chip", was released in October 1996 as the successor of the POWER2. It was a single-chip implementation of the eight-chip POWER2, integrating 15 million transistors on a 335 mm2 die manufactured in IBM's 0.29 μm five-layer metal CMOS-6S process. The first version ran at 120 or 135 MHz, nearly twice as fast as the POWER2 at 71.5 MHz, with the memory and I/O buses running at half speed to support the higher clock frequency. IBM claimed that the performance of this version was 5.5 SPECint95_base and 14.5 SPECfp95_base. A faster 160 MHz part fabricated in the 0.25 μm CMOS-6S2 process was announced at the Microprocessor Forum in October 1997.
The P2SC was not a complete copy of the POWER2, the L1 data cache and data translation lookaside buffer (TLB) capacities were halved to 128 KB and 256 entries, respectively, and a rarely used feature that locked entries in the TLB was not implemented in order to fit the original design onto a single die.
The P2SC was succeeded by the POWER3 as IBM's flagship microprocessor on the RS/6000 line in 1998. A notable use of the P2SC was the 30-node IBM Deep Blue supercomputer that beat world champion Garry Kasparov at chess in 1997. However, the computer's chess-playing capabilities were due to its custom integrated circuits, rather than the P2SCs.

Killbot

In science fiction, a killbot is a large, menacing robot character created to perpetrate murder or other damage.
Known killbots.
In the science fiction slasher film "Chopping Mall" security guard robots are transformed into killbots when a rooftop computer is hit by lightning. The movie was actually originally titled "Killbots".
The 1993 Full Moon Entertainment film "Robot Wars" features robots that have been referred to as "kill-bots".
Both "Chopping Mall" and "Robot Wars" had scream queen Barbara Crampton in them.
The term also appears in satirical works, such as the TV series "Futurama". In the show, Killbots were "defeated" via their pre-programmed kill limit being met, or because of their tendency to fire whenever they hear someone say fire (or any violent-sounding words, such as when they were triggered after thinking someone said "Howitzer"; they really said "how it sur-") even if they are facing each other and that they do not stop firing even when turning round to talk to each other. Predictably, they kill each other far more often than they kill their targets, as well as more often than the targets killing them.
Killbots were also featured in the 2005 production of "Killbot: An American Hero".
An August 18, 2008 Boston Globe article mentioned a MIT student named Zack Anderson who had apparently invented a real life radio controlled robot called a Killbot, which had an attached spotlight, bullhorn and drill.

Charles Cavendish, 3rd Baron Chesham

Charles Compton William Cavendish, 3rd Baron Chesham KCB, PC, DL (13 December 1850 – 9 November 1907), styled The Honourable Charles Cavendish between 1863 and 1882, was a British soldier, courtier and Conservative politician. He served as the last Master of the Buckhounds under Lord Salisbury from 1900 to 1901.
Background.
A member of the Cavendish family headed by the Duke of Devonshire, Chesham was the eldest son of William Cavendish, 2nd Baron Chesham and his wife Henrietta Frances Lascelles, daughter of William Lascelles.
Political career.
Lord Chesham took his seat in the House of Lords on his father's death in 1882. 
In November 1900 he was appointed Master of the Buckhounds under Lord Salisbury. However, as Chesham was serving in South Africa, Lord Churchill was appointed to act as Master of the Buckhounds in his absence. Chesham remained Master until the office was abolished the following year. He was admitted to the Privy Council in July 1901, and also served as a Lord of the Bedchamber to the Prince of Wales (later King George V) from 1901 to 1907.
Military career.
Chesham joined the Buckinghamshire Yeomanry Cavalry. In January 1900 he was appointed in command of a battalion of the Imperial Yeomanry, serving in the Second Boer War, and received the temporary rank of Colonel in the Army. Later that year, he was promoted to Brigadier general and in November 1900 appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) for his services (he was invested by King Edward VII at Marlborough House 25 July 1901 during a brief visit to London). He returned permanently to the United Kingdom by the steamer "RMS Kinfauns Castle" in February 1902.
Family.
Lord Chesham married, in 1877, his second cousin Lady Beatrice Constance Grosvenor (1858-1911), daughter of Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster.
Lady Chesham was appointed a Lady of Grace of the Order of St. John (DStJ) in July 1901, and in December the same year received the decoration of the Royal Red Cross (RRC) for her services with the Imperial Yeomanry Hospital during the Boer War.
He died in November 1907, aged 56, after a hunting accident. There is a bronze statue commemorating his life and deeds located in the Market Square in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire which has Grade II Listed Building status. He was succeeded in the barony by his second but eldest surviving son John. His daughter the Honourable Lilah Constance Cavendish married Sir Mervyn Manningham-Buller, 3rd Baronet.

Therese Krones (7 October 1801 – 28 December 1830) was an Austrian actress of much ability and grace in comic parts. She was born at Freudenthal of parents who were engaged in the theatrical business. 
After several provincial tours she appeared at the Leopoldstädter Theater in Vienna, where she played with Ferdinand Raimund, who greatly influenced her technique.
In 1827, she retired from the stage for a time, being unjustly accused of complicity in the murder of Professor Blank by Severin von Jaroszynski. She wrote several plays: "Sylphide, das Seefräulein" (1828), "Der Branntweinbrenner und der Nebelgeist" (1829), and "Kleopatra" (1830). Krones died in Vienna.

McLeod (tool)

The McLeod rake is a two-sided blade on a long, wooden-handle. It is a standard yet esoteric tool during wildfire suppression and trail restoration. The combination tool was created in 1905 by Malcolm McLeod, a US Forest Service ranger at the Sierra National Forest, with a large hoe-like blade on one side and a tined blade on the other.
The McLeod was designed to rake fire lines with the teeth and cut branches and sod with the sharpened hoe edge, but it has found other uses. It can remove slough and berm from a trail, tamp or compact tread, and can shape a trail's backslope.
The tool can also be used for hand crimping straw mulch into soil a minimum depth of 2", and is sometimes specified by the State of Colorado Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety for use during erosion control and soil amendment activities.
Because of its shape, the McLeod is an awkward tool to transport and store. Ideally it is carried with the tines pointing toward the ground for safety, with a sheath over the cutting edge. However, the mass distribution makes it difficult to carry in this orientation consistently.

HMAS Albany (ACPB 86)

HMAS "Albany" (ACPB 86), named for the city of Albany, Western Australia, is an "Armidale" class patrol boat of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).
Design and construction.
The "Armidale" class patrol boats are long, with a beam of , a draught of , and a standard displacement of 270 tons. The semi-displacement vee hull is fabricated from aluminium alloy, and each vessel is built to a combination of Det Norske Veritas standards for high-speed light craft and RAN requirements. The "Armidale"s can travel at a maximum speed of , and are driven by two propeller shafts, each connected to an MTU 16V M70 diesel. The ships have a range of at , allowing them to patrol the waters around the distant territories of Australia, and are designed for standard patrols of 21 days, with a maximum endurance of 42 days.
The main armament of the "Armidale" class is a Rafael Typhoon stabilised gun mount fitted with an M242 Bushmaster cannon. Two machine guns are also carried. Boarding operations are performed by two , waterjet propelled rigid-hulled inflatable boats (RHIBs). Each RHIB is stored in a dedicated cradle and davit, and is capable of operating independently from the patrol boat as it carries its own communications, navigation, and safety equipment.
Each patrol boat has a standard ship's company of 21 personnel, with a maximum of 29. The "Armidale"s do not have a permanently assigned ship's company; instead, they are assigned to divisions at a ratio of two vessels to three companies, which rotate through the vessels and allow the "Armidale"s to spend more time at sea, without compromising sailors' rest time or training requirements. A 20-berth auxiliary accommodation compartment was included in the design for the transportation of soldiers, illegal fishermen, or unauthorised arrivals; in the latter two cases, the compartment could be secured from the outside. However, a malfunction in the sewerage treatment facilities aboard in August 2006 pumped hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide into the compartment, non-fatally poisoning four sailors working inside, after which use of the compartment for accommodation was banned across the class.
"Albany" was constructed by Austal at their shipyard in Henderson, Western Australia. She was commissioned into the RAN in her namesake city on 15 July 2006.
Operational history.
"Albany" is assigned to "Attack" Division, is based in Darwin and performs border protection and fisheries protection patrols.

Wendisch-Rambow

Wendisch-Rambow is a village of Schwerin in northern Germany. It is in the state Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The population as of 1996 is 201 (Approx).
History.
Naming and foundation.
In the district Stolp two municipalities were given the name Karstnitz, which were differentiated from each other by the additive German and Wendisch. Wendisch Karstnitz received the name Ramnitz to 1937. It is to the Rambowbach, which flows through the Gemeindegebiet of the south northward to the Lupow east of Stolp between Stolpe and Lupow because of a small brook. The Gemarkung consisted of the Rambower forest (Wendisch Karstnitzer forest) and areas of arable land to both sides of the brook. The Lauenburger Chaussee (realm road 2) separated the property Rambow in the north from the property and village Wendisch Karstnitz in the south. From the founders, the village was given the name Wendish-Rambow.
Establishment.
Rambow is mentioned in 1282 in a document, in which Duke Mestwin II of the Stanislaus church in guard of its father confirmed donations. In 1531, it was held by Chorken. 
1575, 1601 and 1605 were belehnt by Tessen with the Schmolsin goods—under it also the Rambow. To the death of swan width units von Tessen it came to the duchess earth courage and to from Chorken, which are to have possessed it 1650. See the Hoof Calissifaction list.
Wendisch Karstnitz and Rambow came into the possession of the Grumbkows in 1724. The Minister of State Philipp Otto von Grumbkow sold it 1733 at Joachim honour realm of Kettelhack, and of this they turned into to the family from Kleist. 
After Brüggemann, Wendisch Karstnitz had six farmers, two Kossäten, a smith, a schoolmaster around 1784 a Vorwerk, and together with the Vorwerk Velsow, which also Fellow, Schmolsin, Fistow and Vilsow was called at that time, altogether fifteen houses. Rambow consisted of Vorwerk, one Wassermühle, six farmers, three Kossäten and fourteen houses. The Karstnitzer of goods in the circle Stolp, to which Wendisch Karstnitz, Virchenzin Rambow and Velsow also belonged, Rowen and Zedlin, acquired the Krockows in 1083. While the Rumbsker remained goods, how they were designated later, in the family estate of the Krockows, Wendisch Karstnitz, Rambow and Velsow turned into 1855 on the family from whisk and then on Alexander of Livonius (died 1871) and its son Artur (died 1904). The three goods were last in the possession of the family Lehmann.
The goods directories register 1910/28 Dr. jur. Engelhardt Lehmann on Wendisch Karstnitz, Rambow and Velsow and 1938 Mrs. A. Lehmann on Ramnitz and P.R. Lehmann on Rambow.
In the year 1938 the manor Ramnitz 850 hectars was large. It had 592 hectares of field, 36 hectares of meadows, 3 hectares of pasture, 209 hectares forest, 8 hectares yard space, wasteland and ways, 2 hectares of surface water, and 45 horses, 200 head of cattle, 60 sheep and 100 pigs. The large manor Rambow field, 16 hectares of meadows, 7 hectares of pastures, 209 hectares of lumber quality trees, 2 hectares of wasteland, yard space and ways and 1 hectare of surface water. The livestock amounted to 35 horses and 180 head of cattle.
End of War.
At the end of World War II, the Russians occupied this area and drove out the residents.
The inhabitants of Ramnitz could not escape the Russian advance. They hid themselves in the Rambower forest and returned on the following day to the village. The east Prussian refugees had fled the Russians, but more people came after that. 
The Russians occupied Ramnitz in the evening hours of 8 March 1945. A Russian tank delivered some shots.
Some days after occupation of the property in Ramnitz, a barn in Rambow and two large Heuschober burned. Under the rubble one found the corpse of Mrs. Holm. The Russians furnished a supplying base in Ramnitz. All cattle from the environment were together-driven here. The Russians withdrew from Ramnitz in 1950. 
Poland could because of the Russian crew only 1950 into the possession of the village set itself. The inhabitants were driven out at a relatively late time from their homeland. The residence card index Pommern determined 192 refugees from this village in the Federal Republic of Germany and 78 in the GDR. The German municipality, Ramnitz, became the Polish Karznica.
War losses were 7 soldiers, 3 civilian dead and 36 missing.

The Late 1500s Era.
Dorothea of v.der Marwitz (1597–1649).
Born v. Moltzahn
At present one wrote the 12 February to its birth 1597. Their parents were TIG and v. Moltzahn on Grubenhagen and its wife Barbara v. Negendanck a.d. H. Egerstorff. In all care drawn up by these and protected, belonged obedienceness in relation to parents, Frömmigkeit, respectableness and God fear to their most outstanding characteristics. The Domina Elizabeth v. Buchwald from the monastery Dobbertin became their first teacher, to whom she pulled in recent years and remained long three years. Subsequently, it returned to its parents and remained there until 1617. In this year it accepted princess Sophie of Mecklenburg, born princess of Schleswig-Holstein as Kammerjungfer, whereby it probably admits to each Hofmann became and also the largest satisfaction of the princess worked. Also princess Anna Maria found countess of Oldenburg favour at it subsequently, to Mecklenburg geb. and transferred it to its services; again in the position of a Kammerjungfer. With faithful diligence and guilty obedience it remained here year twelfth.
Then before-light it with the agreement of their nut/mother at a 2.Sonntag after Trinitatis in Luebeck the Fürstl. Mecklenburgian marshal and secret advice Moritz of v.der Marwitz. Since he had been instructed in the coming two years to Sweden, they lived since that time in Scandinavia. Two daughters were born them, one of it in Sweden.
