Phreatoicidea

Phreatoicidea is a suborder of isopod crustaceans. Extant species are confined to freshwater environments in South Africa, India, and Oceania. This seemingly Gondwana-derived distribution belies the fact that the group once had a cosmopolitan distribution; fossils which can be assigned to the Phreatoicidea are the oldest isopod fossils, and are found throughout the world. In the intervening 325 million years, phreatoicideans have changed little, and are thus considered living fossils.
The first Australian phreatoicidean was described by Charles Chilton in 1891. Two families are represented in Australia: Amphisopodidae in the interior of Australia, and in the west, and Phreatoicidae in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.

It's Your Move (1982 film)

"It's Your Move" is the title of two short films written and directed by Eric Sykes (in 1969 and 1982 respectively). The story of both films involves a married couple moving into a new home and enduring the ineptitude of removal men. As with most other films directed by Sykes, the action unfolds in a style echoing the silent, slapstick comedy era.

Strong Arm Steady

Strong Arm Steady, often referred to as SAS, is a rap/hip hop group in California's underground hip hop scene. As of December 2009, the act consists of members Mitchy Slick of San Diego, California, and (both of Los Angeles) Phil Da Agony and probably the most visually distinct member, Krondon, who is albinistic. Originally an amorphous collective of at least eight, formed as an alternative to the gang-focused productions of West Coast rap's then-dominant Death Row Records, SAS pared down to four members for recording in the studio and performing live, with Xzibit as the frontman. Since he left the group in 2006, the three remaining members have been a stable trio.
Over the years they have recorded many mixtapes and have distributed them all over the world. "Speaking directly to their fans," they were West Coast pioneers in the use of mixtapes as a group's principal method of distribution and marketing, a model necessitated by their neither being DJs nor closely affiliated with a DJ, and a method already proven on the East Coast by 50 Cent and others in the early 2000s.
Talib Kweli signed Strong Arm Steady to his Blacksmith Records label in 2007. The group released a collaboration with producer Madlib, "In Search of Stoney Jackson", with a roster of guest vocalists including studio head Talib Kweli, former SAS member Planet Asia, Guilty Simpson, Phonte (of Little Brother), Fashawn, and "a host of underground Los Angeles's emerging rap talent". "Stoney Jackson", as it has been called for short, was released online as MP3 files in December 2009 through Stones Throw Records, with a CD release date of January 26, 2010. The album was named one of the best albums of 2010 by numerous media outlets including AllHipHop and on the blog of famed producer DJ Premier.
Their album "Arms & Hammers" was released on February 22, 2011 by Blacksmith Records and Element 9 and distributed by Fontana Distribution.

Syzygium francisii

Syzygium francisii is a native Australian tree, common on the eastern sea board, between Morisset, New South Wales (33° S) and Gladstone, Queensland (23° S). Common names include giant water gum, rose satinash, and Francis water gum. The habitat of "Syzygium francisii" is rainforest on basaltic or fertile alluvial soils.
Several fine examples may be seen at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney. An often seen "Syzygium francisii" is at the start of the Mount Warning walking track in far north eastern New South Wales.
Description.
"Syzygium francisii" is a medium to large size tree, occasionally reaching 45 metres in height and a 150 cm in trunk diameter. The tree's crown appears dark and dense.
The bark is a scaly reddish light brown, with depressions caused by the shedding of scales of bark. Prominent buttresses form at the base.
Leaves, flowers and fruit.
The leaves are opposite, simple, entire, 4 to 8 cm long drawn out into a long point at the tip. The leaf margin is often wavy, new growth pinkish.
Flowers: white in panicles. Flowers small, less than 6 mm long. Flowering period September to December. The fruit matures from January to April, being a flattened berry, a common shape in many species of "Syzygium"; the colour is a pale blue, lilac to purple. The flesh is dry and unpalatable to taste.
Seed germination is relatively easy and quick, commencing at 20 days. Soaking of the seeds is recommended to drown insect larvae. Fruit are eaten by many types of rainforest birds.

Aslak Jacobsen Hætta (born 24 January 1824, executed 14 October 1854) was one of the leaders of the Sami revolt in Guovdageaidnu, called the Kautokeino Rebellion, in November 1852. During the riots, the merchant Carl Johan Ruth and the local government official Lars Johan Bucht were killed and the pastor Fredrik Waldemar Hvoslef was whipped. Hætta was sentenced to death for the murder of Carl Johan Ruth and executed by beheading at the age of 30 years.
Hætta was married to Marith Persdatter Kurak and they had 2 children.
Hætta, and the rebellion, are the subject of the 1922 opera "Aslak Hetta" by Finnish composer, Armas Launis, in which their story has been somewhat fictionalized.

FC Margveti Zestafoni

Margveti Zestafoni was a Georgian association football club. It was based in Zestafoni.
History.
In 1990 the Georgian Football Federation was founded to hold their own football competition and leave the Soviet football league system. Clubs like FC Dinamo Tbilisi and FC Guria Lanchkhuti gave up their place in the Soviet Top League to join.
At that time Zestafoni had their own club FC Metallurg Zestafoni. A new club, formed as Margveti Zestafoni, joined Pirveli Liga and was promoted in the first season.
Margveti was a member of Umaglesi Liga and achieved their best season in 1995-96 by finishing runner-up. But in the 1997-98 season, Margveti finished at the bottom and was relegated. A new club using the city legend team name Metalurgi Zestafoni was formed in 1999. Margveti was declared bankrupt in 2000. 
FC Margveti Zestafoni faced financial problems and was relegated in 1998. 
In 2006 "Margveti-2006" was founded in the lower division and recently in Meore Liga, but it is different (municipal) club.
City rival.
Although FC Zestafoni and Metallurgi Zestafoni came from the same city, they never met in the league, and both clubs came from the succession of Metallurg Zestafoni.

Sestroretsk railway station (1871–1924)

Sestroretsk railway station (, "stantsiya Sestroretsk") was a railway station in Sestroretsk, Russia handling transportation to northern destinations including Beloostrov and Sestroretsk. The station was built by Finnish State Railways as the railhead feeder of Riihimäki-Saint Petersburg railroad. It was designed by Swedish architects and it opened on 2 November 1871, when the station's first train arrived from Beloostrov. The Sestroretsk spur line was constructed to serve Sestroretsk armory.
Societies of the Sestroretsk railway.
The station was owned and operated by Finnish railways from 1871 to 1873. From 1873 to 1886 it was operated by the private "Societies of the Sestroretsk railway". This company built a new railway line, which was called Miller's line, and connected to the station at Miller's pier. The organization was devastated in the mid-1880s and, on 1 January 1886, the station was closed along with the branch.
World War I.
In 1914, World War I began. Sestroretsk armory was a leading defensive factory and it was necessary to connect it with the country's railway system. In 1916, the station was restored as a freight terminal.
Closure.
The line did not exist for long. After the revolution Sestroretsk armory had practically stopped production and, in the 1920s, there was a complication of relations between the USSR and Finland. The bridge was blown up and the line was disassembled.
New station.
Later, the part of the line from the bridge straight across the Sestra river was restored and was a part of the Sestroretsk direction. In 1924, a new line was constructed but bypassed this station. The platforms, buildings and structures were taken down to allow the building of new houses in Volodarsky street. The old station was replaced by a new 
Sestroretsk railway station.

The 1970–71 French Division 2 season was the 30th season since its establishment. It was constituted by three geographic groups (South, Center and North) with 16 clubs each. The winners of each group won promotion to the 1971–72 French Division 1. Additionally, the winners met once in the championship play–offs. The club with most points was crowned champion and awarded the trophy.
On the other hand, the bottom club of each group and the worst 15th placed club were relegated to the 1971–72 French Division 3. Meanwhile, all reserves teams were relegated at the end of the season, regardless of their final position, due to the creation of the Division 3, which would also serve as the top league for amateur clubs and the club's reserves sides.
The season began on 23 August 1970 and ended on 12 June 1971. The winter break was in effect from 27 December 1970 to 10 January 1971. Two points were awarded for a win, with no points for a loss. If the match was drawn, each team received one point.

Longfellow, Alden &amp; Harlow

Longfellow, Alden & Harlow (later Alden & Harlow), of Boston, Massachusetts, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was the architectural firm of Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow, Jr. (1854–1934), Frank Ellis Alden (1859–1908), and Alfred Branch Harlow (1857–1927). The firm, successors to H. H. Richardson, continued to provide structures in the Romanesque revival style established by Richardson that is often referred to as Richardsonian Romanesque.
Officially, the firm was Longfellow & Harlow from 1886 until March 1887, with Alden participating as its agent. Then, it was Longfellow, Alden & Harlow, until 1896, when it became Alden & Harlow. The split with Longfellow is described as amicable on page 62 of Margaret Henderson Floyd's book about the firm, and it had more to do with the fact that Longfellow was in Boston and Alden & Harlow had relocated to Pittsburgh and were managing their firm there due to the number of commissions they received. After Alden died, Harlow practiced with different partners in Pittsburgh until his death. Longfellow continued to practice in Boston until his death.
The architects Frederick G. Scheibler, Jr., William L. Steele, and Henry M. Seaver trained in the firm's office. Howard K. Jones was the chief draftsman for the Alden & Harlow office. According to Floyd, "other young draftsmen in the office played roles that are still for the most part unknown". The best documented picture is for the firm's largest commission: the major Carnegie Institute expansion of 1899-1907. Here Jones played a key role, assisted by Steele, Richard Hooker, and John Henry Craner.

Liberati

q
Liberati is a political network founded in Sweden in July 2008. The network was formed in reaction to the controversial passing in June 2008 by the Swedish Parliament, of the so-called FRA Law, a law allowing the National Defence Radio Establishment (Sweden), the national signals intelligence agency, to tap all internet traffic passing in or out of the country, across the national borders. Liberati was initiated by Alexander Bard and Jan Söderqvist and uses various internet social fora to try to influence the traditional political parties, from Libertarianism at one end via pragmatic Liberalism to liberal Socialism at the other end of the spectrum.
Despite early calls for Liberati to become a political party of its own, there are currently no plans to extend the network towards the formation of a separate political party. In addition to Bard and Söderqvist, early members associated with the Liberati movement include political scientist Stig-Björn Ljunggren, author and columnist Oscar Swartz and Member of Parliament Camilla Lindberg, an outspoken opponent to the FRA law from within the Swedish Liberal Party, and a heroine of the anti-FRA law movement after Lindberg became the only representative of the ruling Swedish Center-Right coalition to vote against the FRA law in the parliamentary vote of June 2008.
On the 26th of September 2010 Liberati was disbanded and replaced with both a cross-party liberal network simply called Liberala Nätverket (The Liberal Network), and a new party, Liberaldemokraterna, (The Liberal Democrats).

Silesian Przesieka

Silesian "Przesieka", literally Silesian Cutting (, , ) was a densely forested, uninhabited and unpassable area in the middle of Silesia, spreading from Golden Mountains in the south, along the Nysa Klodzka to the Odra, and then along the Stobrawa, reaching the towns of Namyslow and Byczyna in northern Silesia. Originally, the Silesian Cutting was a boundary, separating territories of two Western Slavic tribes, the Slezanie and the Opolanie. In the 12th century, along the Cutting a border of Lower Silesia and Upper Silesia was established. 
For a long time, the Silesian Cutting was used as a natural military obstacle, protecting the area of Opole from raids of the Moravian and Czech tribes. However, it did not prevent the Hussites from invading Silesia in 1420 (see also Hussite Wars). 
Structure.
The Silesian "Przesieka" was a wide, uninhabited border forest, strengthened on the inside by cut-down trees whose branches were twisted together, with thick bushes and sometimes ramparts and trenches from the 8th–9th century blocking movements from the west. Gates, which could be closed in dangerous times, controlled all roads leading outwards. The "Przesieka" was maintained by local Polish peasants and used in their self-defence. If a settlement expanded in size the fortifications were moved outwards. Placenames like Osiek, Ossig, Hag, Hänchen Przesieka, Lower Silesian Voivodeship or Przesieka, Podlaskie Voivodeship commemorated these unique natural circumstances.
Geographic distribution.
Starting at Namysłów and Byczyna, the main Lower Silesian "Przesieka" (Preseka) comprised the area of Kluczbork, today's woodland between the rivers Stobrawa and Mała Panew and ended at the Silesian Muschelkalk ridge. The fortification continued on the other side of the Oder at the Niemodlin woodland, incorporated the woods to the right of the Nysa Kłodzka and the Golden and Owl Mountains. From there the cutting turned northeast and incorporated the Sudetes, which separated Silesia and Bohemia, including the foothills on a distance of 80 kilometers. The "Przesieka" continued up to the Lower Silesian heathland, the border to Lusatia, a region which was especially well fortified by three trenches (German: Dreigräben) and a passage to the west of Szprotawa. From the Bóbr knee the Cutting incorporated the woodlands of Zielona Góra and eastwards the border forests between Silesia and Greater Poland. At the river Barycz the Cutting turned south to close the circle around Lower Silesia.
The distribution of the Upper Silesian border forests is relatively unknown. Only the western "Preseka" at Hrubý Jeseník and its foothills, the woodlands of the northern Carpathian Mountains and the Moravian Gate as well as at the woodlands of the Polish Jura are established. This enclosed area was divided into two chambers by a border zone. This inner "Przesieka" is in parts preserved until today, visible at the upper Malapane and between Rybnik and Pszczyna. Equally unknown in detail is the division of the Lower Silesian region, which was also partitioned into small chambers divided by strips of woodland.
Impact of German Ostsiedlung.
Town-like settlements already existed before the Ostsiedlung, as craftsmen and merchants formed suburbs of fortified strongholds ("burg(h)s", "castra"). Usually, Slavic marketplaces were set at an open range with few or no permanently inhabited buildings and, after Christianization, a church. Market fields ("ring", "rynek") were in close proximity to fortified strongholds. This system was borrowed from 10th century East Francia and persisted in the Slavic regions until the Ostsiedlung. 
As the Silesian dukes initiated the German Ostsiedlung the border forests offered the chance to plan irrespective of older settlements. This approach was started by Henry I in the late 12th century, and soon other noble and clerical landlords competitively followed his example. The German settlers cleared the forests and thus destroyed the protective effect of the Preseka. To defend their now unprotected soil the Silesian dukes replaced the dissolving Preseka by a strip of villages, fortified towns and castles. The area became the center of the evolving society (Neustamm) of the German Silesians.

Mihkel Martna (17 September 1860 Veltsa parish, Paimpere – 23 May 1934 Tallinn) was an Estonian politician and journalist.
Martna was born in Kreis Wiek in the Governorate of Estonia (in present-day Pärnu County) and studied in a local village school. Thereafter, he worked as country labourer before going to Tallinn in order to become house painter. At this period, he become acquainted with the European workers' movement, socialism and Marxism. As he was one of the first Estonians to be active in this field, he became to be called "the father of Estonian social democracy". As a young man, he was also active in Estonian national movement, publishing articles in Postimees and Sakala and collecting folklore material.
Mihkel Martna disseminated socialist ideas in Tallinn, at the end 1880s he lived in Tartu and tried to influence students there. He later came into conflict with Peeter Speek and other Tartu socialists and moved back to Tallinn. Martna took part in the 1905 Russian revolution and had to live in exile from 1906 to 1917 (mostly in Switzerland, Germany, Finland).
At the beginning of 1918, Martna, having become familiar with the life in independent Finland, decided to support and promote Estonia's independence. He soon formed together with fellow thinkers the Estonian Socialist Workers' Party ("Eesti Sotsiaaldemokraatiline Töölistepartei") and became later the leader of the party's left wing.
Martna also belonged to Estonia's foreign delegations. Together with Jaan Tõnisson and Karl Menning, Martna formed the board of the foreign delegation and he was the first representative of Estonia in Germany (1919).
Martna was member of the Estonian Provincial Assembly, the Estonian Constituent Assembly and Riigikogu (I to IV). 1929–1934 Martna was a vice-chairman of Riigikogu. Martna was one of the central figures in determining the political life of the Republic of Estonia, he was also a leading theoretician of the Estonian Socialist Workers' Party. In 1919 he gained Socialist Workers' International's recognition of Estonia's independence.

Bob Lively

Bob Lively (born Bobby Gene Lively 10 February 1923 Little Rock, Arkansas; died 22 September 1994 Los Angeles, California) was an American jazz saxophonist during the 1940s big band era.
Stan Kenton years.
Lively was a member of the Stan Kenton Orchestra from 1941 to 1945. Kenton's orchestra spent the summer of 1941 playing regularly at the Rendezvous Ballroom in Balboa Beach, California. The Kenton Orchestra struggled a bit after its initial success and its Decca recordings were not big sellers. A stint as Bob Hope's backup radio band was an unhappy experience; Les Brown permanently took Kenton's place. By late 1943 with a Capitol Records contract, a popular record in "Eager Beaver", and growing recognition, the Stan Kenton Orchestra was gradually catching on. Its soloists during the war years included Art Pepper, briefly Stan Getz, altoists Boots Mussulli and Bob Lively, and singer Anita O'Day, who starred on Kenton's first big hit, 1944s "And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine." By 1945 the band had evolved quite a bit. Pete Rugolo became the chief arranger (extending Kenton's ideas), Bob Cooper and Vido Musso offered very different tenor styles, and June Christy was Kenton's new singer. Her hits — including "Tampico" and "Across the Alley From the Alamo" — made it possible for Kenton to finance his more ambitious projects. A popular recording of "Laura" was made, the theme song from the film "Laura", starring actress Gene Tierney, and featured the voices of the band. When Kenton disbanded in early 1949, Harry Betts, Art Pepper, Buddy Childers, and Laurindo Almeida were hired by Earle Spencer.
Earle Spencer Orchestra.
Lively performed with the Earle Spencer Orchestra from 1946 to 1949. Earle formed his band in 1946 after being discharged from the U.S. Navy. The band was based in Los Angeles and was modeled after the progressive sounds of Stan Kenton, Johnny Richards, and Boyd Raeburn. His 1946 band included former Glenn Miller sideman Wilber Schwartz on clarinet and alto sax and Ray Linn, who had played with Tommy Dorsey, on trumpet. Bob Lively played alto saxophone. Spencer disbanded his band in 1952. The band recorded for the Black and White label in 1946 and 1949. Bob Haywood was vocalist for the 1946 band. Toni Aubin (1924–1990) joined Spencer as female vocalist in 1949. She married Howard Phillips who was playing sax (1947-49) in the band. (Bob Lively was also playing in the band.) Toni Aubin recorded "Sunday Afternoon" and other songs with the Spencer orchestra, but also recorded with the Louis Ohls Orchestra out of Arkadelphia, and the Phil Carreon Big Band out of Los Angeles, California.
Fellow musicians.
Through his numerous associations, Lively played alto saxophone, clarinet and piano among the trumpets of Johnny Carroll, Buddy Childers, John Anderson, Gene Roland, Mel Green, the drums of Gene Krupa, John Varney, and fellow saxophonists Stan Getz, Art Pepper, Bob Gioga (1905–1999) and Boots Mussulli (1915–1967) and numerous others well noted throughout the swing band era.
Other band associations.
Lively performed with Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Nat King Cole, Woody Herman, Tommy Dorsey and Benny Goodman.
1950s.
Bob Lively's musical heyday seems to have faded after 1950, although it is reported he sat in for Woody Herman playing the trumpet and later joined the Thombists in 1965.

<doc id="21632638" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21632638" title="CSS Animations">
CSS Animations

CSS Animations is a proposed module for Cascading Style Sheets that allows the animation of HTML document elements using CSS.
History.
While the pseudo-class codice_1 has been used to generate rudimentary animations for years, extensions of CSS into the realm of animation were minimal until the late 2000s decade. As early as 2007, WebKit had announced its intent to include CSS animation, transitions, and transforms as features of WebKit. It also announced the implementation of both implicit and explicit animation through CSS in February 2009. CSS animation has also been put forth as a feature of CSS3, the ongoing draft specification managed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
Browser support.
As of June 2011, Firefox 5 includes CSS Animation support. CSS animation is also available as a module in the nightly builds of WebKit as well as Google Chrome, Safari 4 and 5 and Safari for iOS (iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad), Android 2.x and 3.x, the RIM OS6 web browser, with the codice_2 prefix. It is also used in iTunes 9 to support iTunes LP files.
Future support:
Opera v12+ will support CSS3 animations and transformations with codice_3 prefix
Internet Explorer 10+ will support CSS3 animations and transformations with codice_4 prefix
Controversy.
Early on in the development of the CSS animation it had drawn concern from those who prefer animation via JavaScript or, to a lesser-used extent, Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL); others have claimed that it is a move by Apple Inc., the main sponsor of the WebKit project, to sidestep the inclusion of Adobe Flash (and the incumbent Flash animations) on the company's iOS line of mobile devices which use Safari.

Japanese Regional Leagues

Japanese Regional Leagues (地域リーグ "Chiiki Rīgu") are a group of parallel association football leagues in Japan that are organized on the regional basis. They form the fifth tier of the Japanese association football league system below the nationwide Japan Football League.
Overview.
Japan is divided regionally in a variety of ways, some of them administrative and some more historical. For the football purposes, the country is divided into nine regions. 
All regional league champions earn the right to participate in the All Japan Regional Football Promotion League Series at the end of the year. Runner-ups may also qualify according to criteria set by the Japan Football Association.
Regional league clubs also compete in the All Japan Senior Football Championship, a cup competition. The winner of this cup also earns a berth in the All Japan Promotion Series, and the runner-up may also qualify depending on space and JFA criteria.
Regional league clubs must win the qualifying cup in their home prefecture in order to compete in the Emperor's Cup.
Since the divisions rarely go over 10 members, the season is shorter and long summer breaks may be taken.
Among the existing Japanese clubs there are nine that have never played in the regional leagues. They are:

2009 A-League Grand Final

The 2009 A-League Grand Final took place at Telstra Dome in Melbourne, Australia on 28 February 2009.
It was the final match in the A-League 2008–09 season, and was played between premiers and runners-up . Melbourne Victory won the match 1–0 and became the winners of the 2008–09 Championship, thus becoming the first team to win the A-League domestic treble, after also claiming the 2008 Pre-Season Challenge Cup, and the 2008–09 Premiership.
The match will always be marred by the 10th minute sending off of Cristiano which pen-ultimately contributed to the loss. Similarly Daniel Allsopp was sent off in the 65th minute for an alleged headbutt. The decision infuriated Former Australia international Robbie Slater who was commentating the game "Did the blood coming from Roddy's ear sway it? I thought it was a disgraceful decision and the grand final was ruined." 
As an added touch of notoriety for the game, the Grand Final was the last ever event to be held at the "Telstra Dome", the former name of Melbourne's Docklands Stadium. Due to a change in sponsorship, the stadium is now known as "Etihad Stadium".
Match.
Summary.
With both teams down to ten men for the last 25 minutes, Adelaide were left scoreless with Melbourne taking their second A-League championship medal. Pondeljak's goal earned him the prestigious Joe Marston Medal.
A contentious early red card given to the lone Adelaide striker Cristiano by referee Matthew Breeze saw the Reds go down to ten men by the tenth minute. However, Adelaide managed to hold back Melbourne from scoring until Tom Pondeljak scored 23 metres out from goal in the 60th minute to allow Melbourne to take the lead.
Five minutes later, Melbourne striker Daniel Allsopp was also sent off for allegedly headbutting Adelaide's Robert Cornthwaite in an incident in the Melbourne penalty box.
Both Cristiano and Allsopp's red cards were revoked by the Football Federation Australia in a post-match conference.
Controversy.
The red card to reds talisman Cristiano created a lot of controversy post match. The Brazilian starlet had been warned before that referee Matthew Breeze would send him off if he suspected anything untoward about his heading with flailing arms. He felt as though he was a marked man all season by referee Matthew Breeze " I couldn't sleep after the game." 
Fox Sports analyst and Former Australia international Robbie Slater called for a top-notch overseas referee to control he A-League grand final after yet another controversial decision "ruined" the decider at Telstra Dome on Saturday night. Slater claimed that Breeze got it wrong when he sent Adelaide United striker Cristiano off after just 10 minutes in the championship decider against Melbourne Victory. There was no swinging elbow by Cristiano. They both used their arms for protection when they challenged for the ball. It was a complete accident. Our last three grand finals have all been marred by controversy.
Last year we had Mark Shield missing a handball that deprived Central Coast of a penalty late in the decider against Newcastle. That led to the infamous Danny Vukovic incident when he slapped the ref's wrist and copped a lengthy ban. The year before, Shield sent off Adelaide captain Ross Aloisi after 30 minutes and that turned the grand final against Melbourne into a farce.

Velika Ligojna

Velika Ligojna is a village north of Vrhnika in the Inner Carniola region of Slovenia. It includes the hamlets of Razpoti and Mavsarjev Hrib.
Name.
Together with neighboring Mala Ligojna (literally 'Little Ligojna'), Velika Ligojna (literally, 'Big Ligojna') was attested in written sources in 1309 as "Luckossel" (and as "Lucozel" in 1317, "Lvkozel" in 1318, and "Vunderludigoni" in 1526). The medieval transcriptions indicate that the name was "Luko(va) sela" (literally, 'Luka's village') in the 14th century, probably originally based on the name "*Ľudigojь" and then confused in the transcriptions with the similar name "Luka". If so, today's name is a result of the sound change "ľu-" > "li-" and modern vowel reduction, and means 'Ljudigoj's village'.
Church.
The local church in Velika Ligojna is dedicated to Saint George and belongs to the Parish of Vrhnika. The church was first mentioned in written sources in 1526 and was remodeled in the Baroque style in the 18th century. It was surrounded by a defensive wall during the Ottoman wars in Europe.

Beyond Zero Emissions

Beyond Zero Emissions (BZE) is an Australian-based, not-for-profit climate change solutions think-tank. The group coordinates research and education into the need to reduce human-caused greenhouse gas emissions to 'zero and below' by implementing structural changes to stationary energy, transport, buildings, land use, industrial processes and replacing fossil fuel export revenue. 
BZE released the Zero Carbon Australia Stationary Energy Plan in July 2010, a research collaboration between Beyond Zero Emissions and the University of Melbourne Energy Research Institute. The aim of the report is to provide a detailed, fully realisable, fully costed 10 year plan to replace all stationary energy needs with 100% renewable energy sources, using only current proven technologies and engineering. This addresses the common perception that renewables cannot replace fossil fuels, either due to immaturity of the technology or due to cost concerns. The group invites pro-bono contributions from engineers, scientists, and industry specialists to work on their projects similar to the way open source software is developed. 
In August 2012, Beyond Zero Emissions published and launched a new report called "Laggard to Leader: How Australia can Lead the World to Zero Carbon Prosperity."
In August 2013, Beyond Zero Emissions launched the Zero Carbon Australia Buildings Plan, outlining how energy use in Australia's buildings can be halved in 10 years.
Principles.
Beyond Zero Emissions subscribes to the view that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide are at a dangerous level and growing and that even when the goal of a zero emissions global economy has been achieved, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide will still need to be reduced to a safe threshold. They state that given 350 ppm was the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide at which the disintegration of the Arctic sea-ice began and a level somewhere between 280 ppm (pre-industrial level) and 325 ppm is considered to be a safe threshold, reducing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide to this threshold is desirable and necessary. They believe that this will be achieved using methods such as large-scale implementation of concentrated solar power plants.
The group advocates reducing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to 'zero and below' by implementing structural changes to stationary energy, transport, agriculture, logging, housing and construction and by implementing energy efficiency measures.
Zero Carbon Australia.
Zero Carbon Australia is a project to develop a blueprint for the transition to a decarbonised Australian economy within a decade. The project will consist of six research plans, with each plan using existing technology to find a solution for different sectors of the Australian economy. The proposed plans are Stationary Energy, Transport, Buildings, Industrial Processes, Land Use, and Renewable Energy Superpower.
The "Zero Carbon Australia Stationary Energy Plan" is Beyond Zero Emissions' plan to decarbonise Australia in 10 years, with the goal of achieving zero greenhouse gas emissions from electricity (stationary energy sector) and transport. This report won the 2010 Mercedes-Benz Banksia award for Australian Environmental research.
The "Zero Carbon Australia Buildings Plan" outlines a pathway to zero emission buildings in Australia. The plan details how this can be achieved through a planned energy efficiency retrofit of existing building stock, onsite renewable energy generation, and electrifying current gas appliances. The plan does not aim to make individual buildings energy self-sufficient (i.e. zero net energy consumption), as each building is planned to be connected to a 100% renewable energy grid as outlined in the ZCA Stationary Energy Plan. However, it identifies the maximum feasible contribution from distributed onsite electricity generation using widespread rooftop solar photovoltaic panels plus small wind turbines.
Activities.
The group gives presentations, runs a discussion group and has two weekly radio shows on 3CR interviewing celebrity guests on climate science and global warming solutions. Interviewees have included: James Hansen, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, Wieslaw Maslowski, Ken Caldeira, David Karoly, David Mills, Richard Heinberg, Arnold Goldman, S. David Freeman, Bill McKibben and Tim Flannery.
In May 2012, Beyond Zero Emissions started campaigning for a concentrated solar thermal power plant in Southern Australia. The opportunity was identified due to the likely closure of coal plants Playford B and Northern in Port Augusta. These power plants produce 30% of South Australia’s energy and employ around 400 people. 
The Rudd Government received submissions from Beyond Zero Emissions as a part of the consultation process for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme - Green Paper, and also for Australia 2020.
Beyond Zero Emissions takes part in the yearly Sustainable Living Festival in Melbourne. They have promoted the construction of a high-speed rail link between Adelaide, Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney and Brisbane, which could be powered by renewable energy sources and complete journeys in roughly the same time as domestic flights.

John II of Isenburg-Limburg

John II of Isenburg-Limburg was Lord of Limburg an der Lahn and the last Count of Isenburg-Limburg from 1365 until 1406. He is sometimes designated John III to differentiate him from his non-ruling older half-brother John II (died before 1353).
He was the third son of Count Gerlach V of Isenburg-Limburg from his second marriage (fourth altogether). His mother was Kunigunde of Wertheim. His eldest brother, Gerlach VI of Isenburg-Limburg, had died in the Black Death without male heirs in 1365, and his next oldest brother Hermann had died the same year. With the permission of Pope Urban V, John put aside the office of Canon of Trier Cathedral and took over the rule of Limburg as John II.
Gerlach V had pledged the Lordship of Limburg an der Lahn to the Archbishopric of Trier between 1344 and 1346. In 1374 Limburg’s imperial sovereignty also fell to Trier.
After John's death without heirs in 1406, the House of Isenburg-Limburg was extinct. Limburg was then annexed by Trier. The Archbishop at the time was Werner of Falkenstein.
Marriage and children.
He married Hildegard (died 1419) of Saarwerden (a former countship centered at present-day Sarre-Union, France). The couple had two daughters:

Doran's Bend is situated between the 7th Milestone and 8th Milestone road-side markers on the Snaefell Mountain Course used for the Isle of Man TT Races on the primary A3 Castletown to Ramsey road in the parish of German in the Isle of Man. 
A crash during Thursday evening practice for the 1950 Isle of Man TT riding an AJS motor-cycle resulted Bill Doran suffering cuts and bruises and a broken left leg. The accident occurred on the left-hand bend after Ballig Bridge and was renamed Doran's Bend. Two years later, Bill Doran suffered another accident in the same section of the Snaefell Mountain Course near to Glen Helen during the same Thursday evening practice session which resulted in concussion which again prevented him from competing in the 1952 Isle of Man TT Races.
The series of corners between Ballig and Laurel Bank that make-up Doran's Bend was part of the Highland Course and Four Inch Course used for the Gordon Bennett Trial and Tourist Trophy automobile car races held in the Isle of Man between 1904 and 1922. Also, part of the St. John's Short Course used between 1907 and 1910 and part of the Snaefell Mountain Course used since 1911 for the Isle of Man TT Races and from 1923 the Manx Grand Prix.

Chaplain of His Holiness

A Chaplain of His Holiness is a priest to whom the Pope has granted this title. They are addressed as Monsignor and have certain privileges with respect to ecclesiastical dress and vestments.
In accordance with the motu proprio "Pontificalis Domus" of 28 March 1968, those priests who formerly were called Supernumerary Privy Chamberlains continued to be part of the Papal Household, under the new name of Chaplains of His Holiness. Lower ranks of Privy Chamberlains (Honorary Chamberlains of Purple Robes, Chamberlains "extra Urbem", Honorary Privy Chaplains, and Honorary Chaplains "extra Urbem") were abolished, making Chaplain of His Holiness the first (lowest) of the three ranks of Monsignor.
The role of Chaplain of His Holiness dates to the time of Pope Urban VIII. Such Chaplains have provided unpaid service since the pontificate of Pope Pius VI. The nomination of candidates "extra urbem" may be granted at the request of their bishop through the Apostolic Nunciature, subject to the examination of the merits of the person considered for this rank and to the criteria of the Holy See. Once the candidate has passed all the requirements, a rescript is drawn up by the Secretariat of State attesting to their promotion to this ecclesiastical rank.
The members of the chapters of one church in Rome and the cathedral in Lodi hold this title "durante munere", i.e., while holding that office.
The title no longer expires but requires renewal on the death of the Pope who granted it.

Strmica, Vrhnika

Strmica () is a small settlement in the hills west of Vrhnika in the Inner Carniola region of Slovenia.
Name.
The name "Strmica" was originally an oronym referring to Strmica Hill (626 m) southwest of the settlement. It probably originally had the form "*Strьma(ja) gora" (literally, 'steep mountain') and was later univerbized to "Strmica" (literally, 'the steep one').
Mass grave.
Strmica is the site of a mass grave from the period immediately after the Second World War. The Strmica Mass Grave (), also known as the Zakovšek Woods below Strmica Mass Grave (), is located southwest of the settlement, at an abandoned lime kiln in a sinkhole next to a dirt road on the southeast slope of Strmica Hill. The grave contained the remains of 12 young men from Logatec or Rovte that were murdered on 21 June 1945. The remains were exhumed in 1991 and are now at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Ljubljana.

Ribosome inactivating protein

A ribosome-inactivating protein is a protein synthesis inhibitor that acts at the ribosome. 
A number of bacterial and plant toxins act by inhibiting protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The toxins of the Shiga and ricin family inactivate 60S ribosomal subunits by an N-glycosidic cleavage, which releases a specific adenine base from the sugar-phosphate backbone of 28S rRNA. Members of the family include shiga and shiga-like toxins, and type I (e.g. trichosanthin and luffin) and type II (e.g. ricin, agglutinin and abrin) ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs). All these toxins are structurally related. RIPs have been of considerable interest because of their potential use, conjugated with monoclonal antibodies, as immunotoxins to treat cancers. Further, trichosanthin has been shown to have potent activity against HIV-1-infected T cells and macrophages. Elucidation of the structure-function relationships of RIPs has therefore become a major research effort. It is now known that RIPs are structurally related. A conserved glutamic residue has been implicated in the catalytic mechanism; this lies near a conserved arginine, which also plays a role in catalysis.
Examples include:
They exist in bacteria and plants.

Stara Vrhnika

Stara Vrhnika () is a village north of Vrhnika in the Inner Carniola region of Slovenia. It includes the hamlets of Kuren (or Koren), Podčelo, and Razor.
Name.
The name "Stara Vrhnika" literally means 'old Vrhnika'. Stara Vrhnika was attested in Latin church records as "ex superiore Verchnik", and as "Alt Oberlaibach oder Gorena Verchnik" between 1764 and 1783. The village was originally called "Gornja Vrhnika" or "Zgornja Vrhnika" (literally, 'upper Vrhnika') in Slovene, referring to its position about 30 meters above neighboring Vrhnika. With the arrival of the German-speaking Habsburgs, Vrhnika became known as "Oberlaibach" (literally, 'upper Ljubljana'), which would have made the German designation for Stara Vrhnika the semantically awkward "Ober-Oberlaibach". It was therefore called "Alt Oberlaibach" (literally, 'old upper Ljubljana') in German, and this was the source of the Slovene name "Stara Vrhnika".
Church.
The local church in Stara Vrhnika is dedicated to Saint Leonard. It was first mentioned in written sources in 1526. A second church on Kuren Hill west of the settlement is dedicated to Saint Nicholas. It has a flat painted wooden ceiling with poorly preserved paintings from the 16th century. Both churches belong to the Parish of Vrhnika.

Java API for RESTful Web Services

JAX-RS: Java API for RESTful Web Services is a Java programming language API that provides support in creating web services according to the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural pattern. JAX-RS uses annotations, introduced in Java SE 5, to simplify the development and deployment of web service clients and endpoints.
From version 1.1 on, JAX-RS is an official part of Java EE 6. A notable feature of being an official part of Java EE is that no configuration is necessary to start using JAX-RS. For non-Java EE 6 environments a (small) entry in the web.xml deployment descriptor is required.
Specification.
JAX-RS provides some annotations to aid in mapping a resource class (a POJO) as a web resource. The annotations include:
In addition, it provides further annotations to method parameters to pull information out of the request. All the @*Param annotations take a key of some form which is used to look up the value required.
JAX-RS 2.0.
In January 2011 the JCP formed the JSR 339 expert group to work on JAX-RS 2.0. The main targets are (among others) a common client API and support for Hypermedia following the HATEOAS-principle of REST. In May 2013, it reached the Final Release stage.

It is located slightly south of the city of Sandvika, near the outlet of the river Sandvikselva, at the opposite shore of Kadettangen. Originally a home farm under Nesøya manor, in 1630 it was made into a manor of its own and resident site of Nesøygodset. After a long series of private owners, the whole property was sold to Norconsult-gruppen, a group of consulting firms operating in the international market which established its Norwegian headquarters on the venerable grounds. The futuristic offices premises were built for Norconsult-gruppen and Norconsult International and inaugurated in 1981. The company Saga Petroleum Eiendom acquired the property in 1990 and Norsk Hydro in 1999. From June 2009 the local police will be accommodated in new localities at Kjørbo.

"Anything Goes" is a song by the Australian hard rock group AC/DC. It is the fourth track from their latest album "Black Ice". "Anything Goes" is one of five songs from the album that was played live on their Black Ice World Tour, however it was removed from the setlist on 25 October 2009 and has not been played in a live show since. The single cover for Anything Goes is only the second AC/DC cover to feature frontman Brian Johnson alone (the 1986 re-release of "You Shook Me All Night Long" was the first); others have shown either the band or Angus Young.
The music video for "Anything Goes", which was released on "Family Jewels Disc 3" as part of the 2009 box set "Backtracks", was filmed live in Paris on 25 and 27 February by David Mallet.
"Anything Goes" was a last-time addition to "Black Ice", written as the album was being recorded. The song's main riff bears a marked resemblance to the main riff of "The Shape of Things to Come" by The Headboys, which was a minor hit in 1979.

Reconstruction is the psychological romantic drama film and the debut of Christoffer Boe, who also wrote the screenplay together with Mogens Rukov. It was filmed in Copenhagen and won the Camera D’Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2003 Golden Plaque for Manuel Alberto Claro's luminous wide-screen cinematography.
Plot.
The central character is Alex (Nikolaj Lie Kaas), a Danish photographer with a Stockholm-bred girlfriend, Simone (Maria Bonnevie).
Late one evening Alex suddenly abandons his girlfriend, Simone, to pursue the beautiful Aimee (Maria Bonnevie). In his encounter with Aimee time and place dissolve for him and he becomes a stranger to Simone, to whom he cannot return.
“It’s all a film. It’s all a construction,” announces the narrator, who is soon revealed to be a noted Swedish author, August (Krister Henriksson), as well as the tale’s apparent inventor.
Shooting.
The film was shot almost entirely in available light. Using available lighting is not merely stylistic. Boe doesn't work with storyboards or set schedules.
They shot Super 16 on an Arri SR3 using three different stocks. Then the film was scanned, color-graded, and digitally masked to CinemaScope. The scan was a simple one-light, and the team did no color correction, the opposite of today's trend to perform a digital intermediate. They also pushed the emulsion for extra grain.

Silverwood Colliery platform

Silverwood Colliery platform, the original, was a wooden railway platform built for John Brown's Private Railway in order to operate Paddy Mail trains from Roundwood Colliery to Silverwood Colliery to bring their workers to the new coal mine. The trains were operated by a rake of seven former Mersey Railway coaches hauled by a vacuum brake fitted locomotive, regular assisted by an additional locomotive on the front for extra power. These lasted until the 1930s when, either the workers at Silverwood had moved to new housing in Thrybergh, or were in a position to use the new "pit buses" operated by private companies and later by Rotherham Corporation. The platform was removed shortly after the last train left.
The second Silverwood Colliery platform was a specially constructed railway platform built with only one passenger in mind, H. M. The Queen, when she visited the colliery on 31 July 1975. The royal party stayed overnight on the Royal Train in Silverwood Colliery Sidings before the colliery visit the following day when the platform was used for its only time. The Royal Train was hauled by Class 47 locomotive No.47172. The platform was removed shortly after the royal visit.

Essay Tower

Essay Tower or SA Tower is a closed Pennsylvania Railroad interlocking tower in South Amboy, New Jersey.
History.
Essay Tower was built by the Pennsylvania Railroad to control traffic coming off the Camden and Amboy Railroad and the Perth Amboy and Woodbridge Railroad. The tower was in later years to control the South Amboy Engine Facilities for the New York and Long Branch Railroad. Where the electric locomotive was exchanged for a steam locomotive or in later years a diesel-electric locomotive. The tower served through the shortly-lived Penn Central, and then Conrail followed by New Jersey Transit from 1983 on. In 1986 the tower closed on a warm July 2, 1986 when a GE E60 electric handed train 104 to an EMD F40PH Diesel-Electric Locomotive. From that point onwards "South Amboy would never be the same."
Current status.
Today Essay Tower is now closed following the electrification to Long Branch, New Jersey and service is now automated.

Glen Helen, Isle of Man

Glen Helen ( formerly Glen Rhenass) is situated between the 9th Milestone and 10th Milestone road-side markers on the Snaefell Mountain Course used for the Isle of Man TT Races on the junction of the primary A3 Castletown to Ramsey road in the parish of German in the Isle of Man.
Glen Helen was part of the Highland Course and Four Inch Course used for the Gordon Bennett Trial and Tourist Trophy automobile car races held in the Isle of Man between 1904 and 1922. Also, Glen Helen was part of the course used for 1905 International Motor-Cycle Cup Races held in the Isle of Man. It was also part of the St. John's Short Course used between 1907 and 1910 and part of the Snaefell Mountain Course used since 1911 for the Isle of Man TT Races and 1923 for the Manx Grand Prix.
The glen was created in the 1860s by a consortium of Manx businessmen interested in arboriculture. They laid its paths, carried out extensive planting of trees and ornamental shrubs, constructed river bridges and opened the place to the public in 1867. The attractive name Glen Helen was likely chosen from Greek myth to reflect the beauty of the location.
Today a variety of mature and impressive trees including sequoia, thuja, spruces, Douglas fir, oak, sycamore and beech can be observed. Paths traverse the glen alongside the rivers Neb and Blaber. Three quarters of a mile into the glen you will reach the dramatic Rhenass waterfall.

Jamie Reeves (footballer)

"For the strongman, see Jamie Reeves"
Jamie Reeves (born 5 March 1953) is a regular football pundit on ESPN STAR Sports coverage of the English Premier League. He was formerly a semi-professional football player in England's Southern League, Isthmian League and Essex Senior League, and won the FA Vase twice (in 1979 and 1984). He then moved to Singapore where he played in the FAS Premier League, before becoming a television pundit.
Biography.
Born in Essex, United Kingdom, Jamie attended the Westcliff High School for Boys, where he developed an interest in both Cricket and Rugby. He received a Bachelor's degree in Economics at the University of Leicester in 1973, and a Master's degree in Quantitative Social Science from the University of Kent at Canterbury in 1975.
After his graduation, he switched to soccer at the age of 22. He was soon spotted by his local semi-professional team and quickly moved through the ranks of non-league soccer, culminating in a winning appearance (4-1) at Wembley Stadium in 1979 for Billericay Town in the FA Vase. Five years later he reappeared at the same venue in the same competition, this time winning 3-2 with Stansted in what "The Times" described as "the biggest upset in FA Vase history".
After 13 years playing semi-professionally in the Southern League, Isthmian League and Essex Senior League, Jamie hung up his boots and within a year moved to Singapore. He briefly came out of retirement for one season in the FAS Premier League (the forerunner of the S.League), playing for the now-defunct team Tyrwhitt Soccerites. He established a reputation for scoring with headers, and at the end of the season was named the league's second best player of the year by "The Straits Times".
First appearing on TV in May 1992, working in the studio on the FA Cup Final between Liverpool and Sunderland, Jamie went on to do commentary work on the Malaysia Cup and the S.League before joining ESPN Star Sports. There, he has commentated on the Chinese Super League, the K-League, the UEFA Champions League, the Asian Games, the Asian World Cup Qualifiers and the Tiger Cup, as well as dabbling in La Liga and Serie A. He first worked as a studio pundit on the Premier League in the 2000-2001 season, and has been heavily involved with commenting on that league ever since.
Since 1989, he has also worked as an Economics teacher in Singapore. He is currently the Programme Head for the Humanities Programme at Raffles Institution.
Reeves is married with two children.

National Railroad of Mexico

The National Railroad of Mexico ("Ferrocarril Nacional de México") was one of the primary pre-nationalization railways of Mexico. Incorporated in Colorado in 1880 as the Mexican National Railway ("Ferrocarril Nacional Mexicano"), and headed by General William Jackson Palmer of the Denver and Rio Grande Railway, it completed a narrow gauge main line from Mexico City to Nuevo Laredo in September 1888 after an 1887 reorganization as the Mexican National "Railroad". At its north end, the Texas Mexican Railway, owned since 1883, ran east from Laredo to the Gulf of Mexico at Corpus Christi; a second Gulf connection was completed in 1905 through a branch from Monterrey to Matamoros. Other branches included a cut-off from Mexico City through Querétaro to Celaya and an incomplete Pacific extension from Acámbaro to Uruapan. (Another piece of the latter, from Colima to Manzanillo, remained with the Mexican National Construction Company, and was acquired by the Mexican Central Railway in 1905.) The company was reincorporated again in Utah in February 1902 as the National Railroad of Mexico, and completed standard-gauging the main line in November 1903. The National subsequently acquired three narrow gauge companies in central Mexico. First it leased the Michoacán and Pacific Railway in 1900, giving it branches from Maravatio to Zitácuaro and Angangueo. In 1903 it acquired the Interoceanic Railway of Mexico, which included a main line from Mexico City to Veracruz and a number of branches, in exchange for the Mexican government gaining control of the National. Finally, in 1906, the Hidalgo and Northeastern Railroad, from Mexico City northeast to Tortugas, Pachuca, and Irolo, became part of the National Railroad of Mexico's system.
Six years after the government gained control, the properties of the National and Hidalgo and Northeastern were transferred to the Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México ("National Railways of Mexico") in January 1909. (The Michoacán and Pacific, Interoceanic, and the latter's subsidiaries remained separate companies.) Following privatization in the 1990s, the old National Railroad of Mexico, including most of the Interoceanic, formed the majority of Transportación Ferroviaria Mexicana (now Kansas City Southern de México).

He was born in Montmagny, Canada East, the son of Jean Stanislas Vallée, who took part in the Lower Canada Rebellion, and was educated at St. Anne's College. In 1871, Vallée published an unofficial weekly journal of debates in the Quebec legislative assembly, "L'Écho de la session"; an official journal of debates appeared in 1877.

In the 1877 election for the Quebec legislative assembly, Vallée tied with Alexandre Chauveau in the riding of Rimouski; the returning officer cast the deciding vote in favour of Chauveau. In the 1878 federal election, he was again defeated by the vote of the returning officer; however, a recount gave Vallée the seat by a margin of 33 votes. He ran unsuccessfully for reelection to the House of Commons in 1882 and 1891.

Marcus Livius Drusus Libo

Marcus Livius Drusus Libo was the natural son of Lucius Scribonius Libo and an unknown wife. His natural paternal aunt was Scribonia, the second wife of Augustus, as a consequence of which he was a natural maternal first cousin of Julia Caesaris.
Adoption.
He is believed to have been adopted by Marcus Livius Drusus Claudianus, the father of Livia Drusilla, who was the third wife of Augustus.
However, as a result of his 'L.f.' filiation attested in Book 54 of the "Roman History" of Cassius Dio, it is believed that his adoption was only testmentary (whereby the adoptee is permitted to use, and therefore carry on, the name of the adoptor).
Career.
The career of Marcus Livius Drusus Libo is largely unknown, except that he was ordinary consul in 15 BC with Lucius Calpurnius Piso. Livius Drusus served as an aedile in 28 BC, shortly before the Pantheon in Rome was completed. Historian Pliny the Elder (H.N. xxxvi. 15. s. 24), mentions him among those in Rome, who hosted the Secular Games, during Augustus’ reign. There is also a possibility that he was a member of the Arval Brethren.
Marriage and family.
No wife is on attestation for Marcus Livius Drusus Libo, only a daughter. The existence of this daughter is assumed on the basis of the name of a young woman named Livia Medullina Camilla, whom Claudius was intended to marry in 8AD, but who died on the day of their wedding.
It is believed that Livia Medullina Camilla was the daughter of Marcus Furius Camillus and a woman named 'Livia', theorised to be the daughter of Marcus Livius Drusus Libo on the basis of the name 'Livia' in Livia Medullina Camilla.

Oxford English Limited

Oxford English Limited (OEL) was a socialist-feminist group of undergraduate and postgraduate students campaigning for progressive reforms in the Oxford University English Faculty between 1982 and 1992. OEL's demands included the abolition of compulsory Anglo-Saxon, new optional papers in women’s writing and in literary theory.
Oxford English Limited was created by Daniel Baron-Cohen, Ken Hirschkop and Robin Gable, with support from Terry Eagleton at Wadham College. It organised a programme of seminars, visiting speakers, conferences, debates, student questionnaires and campaigns in pursuit of its aims. A typical highlight was the ‘State of Criticism’ conference on March 8, 1986 (masterminded by President of OEL, Peter Higginson), at which more than 400 people assembled in the English Faculty building in St Cross to hear Raymond Williams, Terry Eagleton, Francis Mulhern and others discuss the future of literary studies.
OEL activists in later years included Ros Ballaster, Tony Pinkney, Carol Watts, Stephanie Flood, Forbes Morlock, Sally Ledger, Alastair Williams, Ben Morgan, Terry Murphy and Giles Goodland. Tetsuo Maruko and Craig Dowler played supporting roles from the sidelines. There was some limited support from within the Faculty from David Norbrook and Paul Hamilton and Stephen Regan at Ruskin College.
In April 1986 OEL created a journal, "" (ISSN 0957-1868) to further its local polemic aims and to advance work in left-wing and feminist literary theory and cultural studies more generally. Nine issues were published between 1986 and 1991. The editor Tony Pinkney’s contributions across these issues offer a sustained and theorised history (and counter-history) of Oxford English Studies from Matthew Arnold to the 1980s. A one-volume selection from "News from Nowhere" will be published by Kelmsgarth Press in 2015.
The OEL project at Oxford has been widely recognised in later histories of the rise of literary theory in the UK. For example, Josephine M. Guy and Ian Small note in their "Politics and Value in English Studies" that ‘there has been a long-standing debate in the Oxford periodical "News from Nowhere" about the future of English studies in that university’; and Andrew Milner, in his important book "Re-Imagining Cultural Studies: The Promise of Cultural Materialism", remarks that ‘a self-proclaimed “third generation” of radical literary theorists would coalesce around Oxford English Limited and the journal, "News from Nowhere"’.
The Oxford English Faculty of the late 1970s had not proved able to open itself to the waves of Continental theory which were then remaking the very field of literary studies, though good work was being done by figures like Anne Jefferson and David Robey in Oxford European language studies. Oxford English Limited, despite its exiguous resources as it battled an entrenched and powerful Faculty, thus represented the new energies of the subject, and it and its William Morris-inspired journal remain a small but colourful chapter in the wider literary theory ‘revolution’ of the 1980s and 1990s.

Banco Português de Negócios

Banco Português de Negócios (English: Portuguese Bank of Business), or simply BPN, is a Portuguese banking institution. It used to be a private bank, but was nationalized by the Portuguese Government in 2008 after a bad management and malpractice-related debt of 1.800 billion euros and several irregularities uncovered in the institution. In 2011, BPN, stripped of many of its debts and bad loans, was sold to Angola’s Banco BIC for €40 million.
History.
BPN - Banco Português De Negócios, S.A. was founded in 1993 and was based in Lisbon.
Scandal.
Portugal's Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos told a press conference after a special cabinet meeting that the government was to assure deposits in BPN, and that the management of BPN was to be given to the Caixa Geral de Depósitos (Portugal's public bank) under Bank of Portugal's (Banco de Portugal, the Portuguese Central Bank) supervision from November 3, 2008, to prevent a financial crisis chain reaction in Portugal. Portuguese judicial authorities detained the former president of financially troubled BPN. José Oliveira e Costa, who was the CEO of BPN between 1997 and early 2008, was arrested on charges of suspected tax fraud, money laundering, forgery, abuse of credit and illegal gains.
In spite of having "a market share of around 2 percent", the case of BPN was particularly serious because of its political implications - Portugal's then current President Cavaco Silva and some of his political allies maintained personal and business relationships with the bank and Oliveira e Costa 
In the grounds of avoiding a potentially serious financial crisis in the Portuguese economy, the Portuguese government decided to give them a bailout, eventually at a future loss to taxpayers. Because of that, the role of Banco de Portugal (BdP) (Portuguese Central Bank) in regulating and supervising the Portuguese banking system, when it was led by Vítor Constâncio from 2000 to 2010, has been the subject of heated argument, particularly whether Vítor Constâncio and the BdP had the means to do something or whether they revealed gross incompetence. In December 2010, Constâncio was appointed vice president of the European Central Bank, for an eight-year mandate, being responsible for banking supervision. Shortly after, in April 2011, the Portuguese Government would request international financial assistance as the State itself would be declared insolvent.
Art collection.
The bank's art collection, including 85 works by the Catalan artist Joan Miró acquired from a private collection in Japan between 2003 and 2006, became state property in 2008 as part of the nationalization. In early 2014, the Miró paintings were scheduled to be sold by its then-owner, Portuguese state holding company Parvalorem, at Christie's in London. They had never been displayed publicly in the country. The most notable works included "La Fornarina (After Raphael)" (1929), with an estimated value of £2 million - £3 million, and "Femmes et Oiseaux", which was expected to fetch £4 million - £8 million. Portugal hoped to earn at least $50 million from the sale. A group of opposition lawmakers appealed to Portugal’s public prosecutor to stop the sale. Lisbon’s administrative court, however, ruled that the sale had not been decided on directly by the government of Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho and that Parvalorem had not breached any administrative rule. Socialist and communist deputies also raised the issue in parliament, but their bid to prevent the planned sale was outvoted by the ruling centre-right coalition. Still, Christie's withdraw the works from sale only hours before the auction was scheduled to start, citing "legal uncertainties created by this ongoing dispute".

The Ferrocarril de Veracruz al Istmo ("Vera Cruz and Isthmus Railway") was one of the primary pre-nationalization railways of Mexico. Incorporated in West Virginia in 1898 as the Vera Cruz and Pacific Railroad ("Ferrocarril de Veracruz al Pacífico"), it built a line from Córdoba to Jesús Carranza on the Tehuantepec National Railway, with a branch from Veracruz to Tierra Blanca. The Mexican government gained control in May 1904 and organized the Ferrocarril de Veracruz al Istmo to operate the property under lease.
Control was transferred to the government-owned Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México ("National Railways of Mexico") in 1910, and in November 1913 that company took over the property and operations. Following privatization in the 1990s, Ferrosur acquired the former Veracruz al Istmo.

Oakenshawe Historic District is a national historic district in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It comprises 334 buildings which reflect the neighborhood's development during the period 1890 to about 1926. The neighborhood evolved in two stages on the 19th century Wilson estate. The first phase of growth is represented by frame houses dating from 1890 to about 1910 reflecting vernacular interpretations of the Victorian Gothic and Italianate styles. The second stage of development began in the World War I era, when several developers transformed the property by constructing a neighborhood of brick "daylight" rowhouses in revival styles popular at the time.
It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

The Basement (play)

The Basement is a television play (later a stage play) by Harold Pinter. It was written first as a screenplay for a film, then revised for television and broadcast on 20 February 1967.
Origin: "The Compartment".
"The Basement" is based on "The Compartment" (1965), an unpublished 27-page screenplay (circulated only in typescript) that Pinter wrote in 1963–65 "for a film never made, planned as part of a triple-bill, "Project I" promoted by Grove Press, New York, with Samuel Beckett's "Film" and Eugène Ionesco's "The Hard-Boiled Egg"" (Baker and Ross 112). Of the three works planned for this trilogy of films, "only "Film" would be produced, being released in 1965" (112).
According to Pinter's official authorised biographer Michael Billington, also cited by Baker and Ross (112), "Pinter's contribution "The Compartment" lay dormant until he rewrote it for television as "The Basement"" (Billington 191).
Setting.
The ""exterior"" and ""interior"" of ""a basement flat"" in various seasons and at various times of day and night ("Two Plays and a Film Script" 91–112).
Synopsis.
Two men, (Tim) Law and (Charles) Stott, compete for possession of and dominance over a "basement flat" and their at-times mutual girlfriend, Jane. During the course of the play, they reverse roles with relation to each other, to the ownership or possession of the flat, and to their relationship with or possession of Jane. The changing furnishings of the room reflect their changing roles and who is in power over whom at various points in time. At first Jane appears to be submissive in relation to the men; but as the action develops, at times she appears to dominate each man and both of them. The character relationships between Stott and Law and the basic plot resemble Pinter's prose fiction works "Kullus" and "The Examination".
Productions.
Television première.
First transmitted on 20 February 1967, it formed part of BBC 2's "Theatre 625" series.
Stage première: Eastside Playhouse, New York, October 1968.
"The Basement" was first produced on stage at the Eastside Playhouse, in New York City, in October 1968, as part of a double bill with Pinter's play "Tea Party", directed by James Hammerstein.
Duchess Theatre, London, September 1970.
Hammerstein also directed another stage production at the Duchess Theatre, in London, on 17 September 1970 ("The Basement", "HaroldPinter.org") with a new cast.

The Purple Onion

The Purple Onion was a celebrated cellar club in the North Beach area of San Francisco, California located at 140 Columbus Avenue (between Jackson and Pacific). With an intimate, 80-person setting, the club was a popular influence in local music and entertainment during the Beat era.
The Purple Onion originally opened in 1952 under the management of Keith Rockwell. His sister and brother-in-law, Virginia "Ginnie" and Irving "Bud" Steinhoff would frequently work weekends at the club until 1960 when they took over management. Bud Steinhoff managed the Purple Onion until his death in November 1983. Virginia Steinhoff continued to operate the club until 1989.
Notable entertainers who either got their starts or played the California club in the 1950s and 1960s include Maya Angelou, Jim Nabors, Bob Newhart, Lenny Bruce, Woody Allen, Phyllis Diller (who made her stand-up debut here), the Kingston Trio, and the Smothers Brothers (then a trio)—who recorded their first album, "The Smothers Brothers at the Purple Onion" there. Richard Pryor also performed at The Purple Onion.
In the early 1990s, Tom Guido made the club the center of San Francisco's garage rock scene, featuring such bands as The Trashwomen, The Phantom Surfers, The 5.6.7.8's, Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Groovie Ghoulies, The Go-Nuts, Guitar Wolf and many others.
In 2004, the club returned to comedy. Photographer and booker Dan Dion started a weekly comedy night that featured comedians such as Robin Williams, Paul Krassner, Jim Short, and Tom Rhodes. David Owen presented the debut of Mort Sahl in June 2005, and shows by Greg Proops, Zach Galifianakis, Todd Barry, Dan Piraro, and Judah Friedlander. By 2010, the club was only running weekend shows, though these shows were usually over capacity at 100–110 people. In 2012, the building was sold with "no plans to rescue".
The original location closed its doors on September 24, 2012. The club was reopened as The Purple Onion at Kell's at 530 Jackson Street in San Francisco on November 2, 2012.

Ursula Frayne Catholic College

Ursula Frayne Catholic College is a private, co-educational school located southwest of Perth, Western Australia, operating on two campuses. Years 7 to 12 currently attend Frayne at the Duncan street campus in Victoria Park, while students from Kindergarten to Year 6 are educated at the Balmoral street campus in East Victoria Park.
The College was established in its present form in 1990, but dates back to a school originally founded by the Sisters of Mercy, led by Mother Clare Buggy, in 1899. The school was named after Mother Ursula Frayne to publicly commemorate the first leader of the Sisters of Mercy and founder of many Catholic schools in Western Australia.
History.
A group of the Sisters of Mercy, led by Mother Clare Buggy, arrived from Northern Ireland in 1899 and created their first school in the current place of the Duncan street campus, naming it St. Joachim's. Our Lady Help of Christians school was built in the areas of East Victoria in 1936 to supply education for newcomers to the suburb. In the 1950s, the Archbishop noticed that a boys' school had not yet been built in the south-east suburbs of Perth and so he asked the Congregation of Christian Brothers in Sydney for help, while the East Victorian Parish donated land worth around ₤2,000. St. Francis Xavier College was finally finished in 1953 and was staffed by the Christian Brothers.
However, with declining enrolments at Xavier College, the college united with Our Lady Help of Christians, and soon afterwards, amalgamated with St. Joachim's School to become Ursula Frayne Catholic College.

I Got a Man

"I Got a Man" is a 1992 hip hop song by American rapper Positive K. It was released as the first single from his debut album "The Skills Dat Pay Da Bills". Positive K provides not only the male vocals on the song but also the female vocals, raising the pitch of his voice with studio technology.
The single peaked at #14 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 on the chart week of March 20, 1993, making it the rapper's only Top 40 hit.
Analysis.
The song is about a man's desire to engage romantically with a woman he meets on the street. Although the woman is already in a relationship, the man refuses to consider this relevant to his pursuit. She continues to reject him and persists in explaining her satisfaction with her current relationship. She even offers to alternatively pursue a platonic friendship with the man, but he declines. He further suggests that he is not interested in a committed relationship or plying her with gifts; rather he is in favor of physical pleasures they can experience together. She rebukes him and remarks that she prefers what she has.
Samples.
The music behind the lyrics samples the 1980 disco single "Rescue Me" by A Taste of Honey as well as the song "Spread Love" by the a cappella group Take 6, the song "High Power Rap" by the rap group Crash Crew, and the electric guitar riff from "Mama Used To Say" by Junior, and the horn from "Get Up and Dance" by Freedom. The spoken intro of the song is sampled from the 1990 film "Die Hard 2" in which John McClane (played by Bruce Willis) complains about his bad luck.
Legacy.
In 1999, Chante Moore and Jermaine Dupri used an interpolation of the song on their remix of "Chante's Got a Man".

VK3RTV

VK3RTV is an amateur television station based in Melbourne, Australia. The station's repeater is located on Mount Dandenong and is one of a number of audio and video repeaters licensed to Amateur Radio Victoria. The output of this repeater can be received by many but not all standard digital television receivers at the start of the UHF TV band, roughly where UHF Channel 16 would be if there was such a channel. The output of the repeater is only 30 watts and is at a much lower signal level than commercial, community and government TV broadcasters. A masthead amplifier would be of assistance in receiving the station but is not a necessity. An up to date list of Amateur TV capable Set Top Boxes or Digital TV receivers can be found at VK3KHB
Transition to Digital.
VK3RTV has been converted to digital transmission only, after 30+ years of analog transmission since 1979. VK3RTV is now broadcasting with two Standard Definition digital channels (576i). The transition from analog to digital was partly funded by the Wireless Institute of Australia and users / viewers of the service.
Programming.
Amateur Radio Operators are restricted in terms of the content they may transmit in that the transmission of "entertainment" is not allowed. However Amateur Radio Operators are nonetheless able to transmit a wide range of educational material related to Amateur Radio, electronics and many other subjects.
Typical programs or video viewers can expect to see include Amateur Radio related videos, slideshows, electronics tuition, home videos, test patterns, sound experiments, retransmissions of amateur radio nets and videophone contacts with other amateurs and link ups with International Space Station, SKYPE links to other ATV groups across Australia or just about anywhere in the world.
The following regular programming has been noted:
Most Saturdays around 7.30 PM, Peter VK3PB shows and hour or two of educational or Amateur Radio related material including episodes of the IPTV show Amateurlogic. From time to time a digital fish tank, similar to live Fishcam which used to be shown on Community Television on Channel 31. 
Most Fridays starting about 9.30 P.M. VK3KHB, transmits Astronomy related material as well as other subjects of interest.

Old Goucher College Buildings is a national historic district in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It is an approximate 18-block area in the middle of Baltimore which developed in the late 19th and 20th centuries. It is characterized generally by two- and three-story brick row houses constructed mostly in the 19th century and several large-scale institutional and commercial buildings dating from both centuries. Stylistically, the area is characterized primarily by Italianate, Romanesque, Colonial Revival, and Art Deco influences. The district includes a series of large scale, multiple story brick and stone structures built for the Women’s College of Baltimore, present-day Goucher College. Three buildings designed by the nationally famous architect Stanford White are found here.
It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

The American première was given in 1970 by the Repertory Theater of Lincoln Center, with Barbara Tarbuck, Robert Symonds and James Patterson, directed by Peter Gill.
Background.
In the introduction to the first volume of his "Complete Plays", Pinter wrote:
There are two silences. One when no word is spoken. The other when perhaps a torrent of language is being employed. This speech is speaking of a language locked beneath it. That is its continual reference. The speech we hear is an indication of that which we don't hear. It is a necessary avoidance, a violent, sly, anguished or mocking smoke screen which keeps the other in its place. When true silence falls we are still left with echo but are nearer nakedness. One way of looking at speech is to say that it is a constant stratagem to cover nakedness.

Suonenjoki rail collision

The Suonenjoki rail collision occurred on 12 August 1998, when an InterCity train arriving from the north and a freight train arriving from the south collided south of the Suonenjoki railway station in Finland. 26 people were injured, one of them seriously. The rear end of the locomotive of the freight train was pushed high up in the air on top of its first car. The InterCity had six cars and the freight train 41 cars. Both trains were powered by VR Class Sr1 locomotives, which are still in use.
Chronology of events.
The InterCity train 72 en route from Iisalmi to Helsinki via Kouvola was scheduled to pass freight train 2051 in Airaksela, north of Suonenjoki, with the freight train waiting on the passing loop and the InterCity using the main line. On the day of the accident though the freight train was running 30 minutes late. The train dispatcher was planning to make the pass at Suonenjoki railway station, which would delay the departure of the InterCity by 3 minutes. A route was secured for the InterCity to the Suonenjoki railway station, where it was signaled to stop and wait for the freight train to pass the station.
However, before the freight train could arrive at Suonenjoki, the InterCity left the station on schedule at 5:57:01, missing the red "stop" aspect of the signal. Upon noticing the approaching train the drivers of both trains activated the emergency brakes and, when the collision seemed inevitable, jumped off the trains. The dispatcher noticed that the main track was occupied by the wrong train and immediately started calling both trains on radio. No answer was heard, however, as the drivers had already jumped out and the trains collided.
Due to the high velocity of the passenger train – – and the large mass of the freight train, running at ) on impact, the collision was violent. The whole InterCity train moved back and the first two cars of the freight train were pushed under its locomotive. This forced the rear end of the locomotive to rise high up in the air and touch the overhead lines. The cars luckily remained on the tracks, which were running on a high embankment.
Causes.
The accident was caused by the driver of the InterCity train ignoring the "stop" aspect of the main signal. The driver heard the conductor's "ready" bell signal and concentrated on leaving the station by the second. A signal repeater was possibly malfunctioning. Other contributing factors were the bright daylight that prevented the driver from clearly seeing the red signal, and the general "obsession" among InterCity drivers to obey the timetable by the second.
Aftermath.
The accident, coupled with the Jyväskylä rail accident, showed the importance of the automatic train control system, which was installed on all major lines during the following years.
The two locomotives, Sr1 units 3042 (freight train) and 3031 (InterCity) were refurbished and returned to service.

Christopher Fyfe

Christopher Fyfe (9 November 1920 – 26 August 2008) was a Scottish historian most noted for his work on Sierra Leone in West Africa.
Biography.
Christopher Hamilton Fyfe was born in England in 1920 to a family of Scottish ancestry. His father moved to Ontario, Canada, where he became principal of Queen's University. The family subsequently moved to Aberdeen, where his father served a similar role at Aberdeen University.
Fyfe graduated from Gordonstoun School and entered University College, Oxford. His studies were interrupted by a spell in the Army during World War II as a gunner. After graduating from college, he became a school teacher in Düsseldorf, West Germany.
In 1950 Fyfe was invited by his brother-in-law, who was with the colonial secretariat in Freetown, to organise the Sierra Leonean archives. After two years as the government archivist, preserving and classifying precious documents, and teaching assistants, he returned to England. There he lived first in London, then Bristol and Belfast. 
Fyfe spent ten years working on his seminal "History of Sierra Leone" (1962). He modelled his 852-page text on James Joyce's novel "Ulysses", writing it as a single block of text. When the publisher demanded chapters, Fyfe inserted numbered breaks.
In his masterwork, Fyfe explored the history of the Creole (Krio people) of Sierra Leone, celebrating their role as "the unrecognised vehicle by which not only British rule but trade, education, and Christianity, were conveyed to west Africa". His work stimulated scholars from Sierra Leone, who studied the Creoles specifically. They later adopted a new identity as the Krio people, marking their sense of ethnicity. 
Following the publication of his book, Fyfe took up a lectureship at the University of Edinburgh in 1962, at the newly founded Centre of African Studies. He became a reader in 1964, retaining this position until his retirement in 1991. The bicentenary of Freetown was celebrated in 1987 with an international, interdisciplinary conference, at which Fyfe was honored as a father of the Krio cultural revival. 
He edited the "Journal of African History" and wrote numerous reviews of new books in the field. He regularly revised his lectures in light of the latest trends in historical research. He published a biography of James Africanus Horton, the first African graduate of the University of Edinburgh; a collection of letters written by freedmen who settled in Sierra Leone; and edited works with other historians.
Fyfe produced a shorter history of Sierra Leone, which was used as a school text book in Sierra Leone. He was a mentor to many younger researchers of Sierra Leone. Some became key figures in the intellectual establishment of Freetown. Some became at odds with various governments and had to go into exile. 
Fyfe was active in the arts scene in Edinburgh. He helped preserve Old Town from motorway development that would have cut through the historic architecture. He died in London in 2008, aged 87.

Tatyana McFadden

Tatyana McFadden (born April 21, 1989,) is a Russian-born United States Paralympian athlete competing in the category T54. McFadden has won 10 Paralympic medals in multiple Summer Paralympic Games and is training for the 2014 Winter Paralympics in sit-ski competitions.
Biography.
McFadden was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, on April 21, 1989. She was born with spina bifida, a congenital disorder that paralyzed her from the waist down. Her birth mother abandoned her in an orphanage that was too poor to afford a wheelchair for her, so she walked on her hands for the first six years of her life. The doctors told her she was so sick that she had very little time to live. While in the orphanage, she met Deborah McFadden, who was visiting Russia as a commissioner of disabilities for the U.S. Health Department. Deborah, a single mother, adopted Tatyana and took her to live in Baltimore.
McFadden took up a variety of sports while growing up to strengthen her muscles: first swimming, then gymnastics, wheelchair basketball, sled hockey and track and field. McFadden attends the University of Illinois studying for a degree in Human Development and Family Studies, and is on the University of Illinois Wheelchair Basketball team.
Competition.
McFadden began racing at the age of eight. Competing in the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, Greece, she won a silver medal in the women's 100 metres – T54 event; a bronze medal in the women's 200 metres – T54 event; finished fifth in the women's 400 metres – T54 event; and went out in the first round of the women's 800 metres – T54 event. She also competed at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, China, where she won a silver medal in the women's 200 metres – T54 event; a silver medal in the women's 400 metres – T54 event; a silver medal in the women's 800 metres – T54 event; a bronze medal in the women's 4 x 100 metre relay – T53-54 event; and finished sixth in the women's 100 metres – T54 event.
Until 2009, McFadden specialized in shorter distance sprints. She entered the Chicago Marathon in 2009 as a lark. Unexpectedly, she won, finishing so soon that her mother didn't have her camera ready to record the victory. That was the first of a series of marathon victories for her, including New York in 2010, Chicago in 2011 and London in 2011.
McFadden's coach at the University of Illinois is Adam Bleakney, himself a veteran wheelchair racer.
Tatyana and her sister Hannah McFadden competed in the same Paralympic final (100m – T54 in London 2012).
McFadden became the first athlete to win six gold medals at a championships during the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships in Lyon. She claimed gold in every event from the 100 meters through to the 5,000 meters. McFadden also won the Boston, Chicago, London, and New York marathons in 2013. This made her the first person – able-bodied or otherwise – to win the four major marathons in the same year. She also set a new course record for the Chicago Marathon (1 hour, 42 minutes, 35 seconds).
McFadden began 2014 by returning to the country of her birth, Russia, to compete in the Winter Paralympic Games in Sochi. After winning silver medal in the 1km Sprint sitting cross-country skiing event; McFadden claimed she was "fulfilled" after winning the medal in front of all of her family including her biological mother. McFadden finished in 5th place in the Women's 12km. Just over a month after Sochi, McFadden returned to wheelchair racing at the London Marathon, where she successfully defended her title in a new course record time.
Activism.
McFadden had difficulty competing at high school. Atholton High School would not allow her to race at the same time as able-bodied runners, with officials saying her racing chair created a safety hazard and gave her an unfair advantage (as the best wheelchair racers are noticeably faster than runners over long distances). She competed in separate wheelchair events at high school meets, meaning that she would circle around an otherwise empty track by herself, which embarrassed her. In 2005 Tatyana and Deborah McFadden filed suit against the Howard County Public School System and won the right for her to race at the same time as the runners starting in 2006, though her score would not be counted for her team.
Her legal victory led to its own controversies, though. In 2006, one of her Atholton teammates lost her victory in the 1600 meters at the state championships after McFadden was ruled to have been acting as a "pacer" for her, by encouraging her rather than racing on her own. And in 2008, McFadden collided with a rival runner from Bishop McNamara High School after a 200-meter race, inflicting bruises and cuts to the runner's legs and making her miss her conference title meet from the injuries.
McFadden's lawsuit is credited for the eventual passage of the Maryland Fitness and Athletics Equity for Students with Disabilities Act, requiring schools to give students with disabilities the opportunity to compete in interscholastic athletics.
She was also a leader of an ultimately unsuccessful effort against a 2012 Russian law to prohibit adoptions of Russian children by American parents.

Mentuhotep (treasurer)

Mentuhotep was an Ancient Egyptian official and treasurer under the 12th dynasty pharaoh Senusret I. Mentuhotep is one of the best attested officials of the Middle Kingdom period. There is a series of statues found at Karnak, showing him as a scribe. On these he has been given the title of "overseer of all royal works", which would suggest that he was involved in overseeing the construction of the temple at Karnak. At el-Lisht he had a large tomb next to the pyramid of Senusret I. When it was found it was badly damaged, but there are remains of high quality reliefs and fragments of statues. The burial chamber still contained two sarcophagi, one smashed and the other one well preserved, made of granite and with brightly painted interiors.
In Abydos a large stela is erected in Mentuhotep's name. It is inscribed with a number of official titles, including those of vizier. The vizier's title does not appear in the tomb of Mentuhotep. Therefore, there is some discussion as to whether he was actually a vizier or whether it was an honorific title.
In year 22 of Senusret I a certain Sobekhotep is attested as treasurer. Mentuhotep must have been his successor. It is unknown whether he was still in office under Amenemhet II.

Johnny Henderson Grand Annual Chase

The Johnny Henderson Grand Annual Chase is a Grade 3 National Hunt chase in Great Britain which is open to horses aged five years or older. It is run on the New Course at Cheltenham over a distance of about 2 miles and 110 yards (3,319 metres), and during its running there are fourteen fences to be jumped. It is a handicap race, and it is scheduled to take place each year during the Cheltenham Festival in March.
History.
The Grand Annual is the oldest race at the Festival, and it is also the oldest chase in the present National Hunt calendar. It was first run in April 1834, and it was initially contested over three miles of open country at Andoversford, near Cheltenham. The race was discontinued in the 1860s, but it was revived at the turn of the century. During the early 1900s it took place at several different venues, including Melton Mowbray, Leicester and Warwick. It returned to Cheltenham in 1913.
The name of Johnny Henderson (1920–2003), a banker and racehorse owner, was added to the race's title in 2005. Henderson, the father of trainer Nicky, realised in the early 1960s that the racecourse at Cheltenham was attracting the interest of property developers. To safeguard its future, and that of the Festival, Henderson and other Jockey Club members formed the Racecourse Holdings Trust, and raised £240,000 to purchase the venue.
The running order of the races at the Cheltenham Festival was altered slightly in 2009, and the Johnny Henderson Grand Annual Chase is now the last event on the final day.

2 SS Infantry Brigade

The 2 SS Infantry Brigade (mot) was formed on the 15 May 1941, under the command of Karl Fischer von Treuenfeld with the 4th and 5th SS Infantry (formerly "Totenkopf") Regiments and began its operational service in September in the rear area of Army Group North, under which command it would spend its entire existence. It gradually began to incorporate foreign legions of the SS under its operational control, such that it became regarded as a multinational unit, especially on the siege lines of the Leningrad front. After the western legions departed for refit, it began operating with Latvian volunteer formations and eventually was re designated the 2nd Latvian SS Infantry Brigade and on the 18 May 1943, and used as the cadre in the formation of the 19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Latvian) in January 1944.
History.
Formation.
The 2 SS Infantry Brigade was raised on 15 May 1941 and was placed under the command of Army Group North for the invasion of the Soviet Union. Prior to this, the role that the unit would undertake during the assault was discussed in a meeting between Henning von Tresckow and of the RFSS office, held just three days before hostilities between Germany and the Soviet Union began. In this meeting it was decided that the 2 SS Infantry Brigade along with the 1 SS Infantry Brigade and the SS Cavalry Brigade would be used in the rear of the advancing army to conduct anti partisan operations as well as assisting in rounding up the Jewish population. A few weeks later they were involved in the mass murder of the population of the occupied territories, their victims for 1941, could be measured in the tens of thousands.
1942.
In 1942, the 19th and 21st Latvian Security Battalions from the Latvian Legion were attached to the Brigade. The brigade was now an international formation that included Dutch, Flemish and Norwegian volunteer Legions.
1943.
In January 1943, the 19th and 21st Latvian Schuma (Police) Battalions were serving with the Brigade, impressed by their conduct, Heinrich Himmler changed the 2 SS Infantry Brigade into a Latvian Brigade and at the same time set the foundations for a Latvian Division.
The existing 18th, 24th, and 26th Latvian Schuma Battalions serving in Leningrad were used to form the Brigade's 2nd SS Volunteer Regiment. They were then sent for training at Krasnoye Selo, where Himmler added the 16th Latvian Schuma Battalion to the brigade in February.
On 18 May 1943, these Latvian Battalions along with the other three Latvian Legion Battalions were incorporated into the 2 SS Infantry Brigade, and re-designated the 2 SS Latvian Brigade. The Dutch, Flemish and Norwegian formations were then removed from the Brigade and the 2 SS Latvian Brigade was deployed with Army Group North. It was placed under the command of Brigadeführer Fritz von Scholz and was engaged in defending the west bank of the Volkhov River near Leningrad until late 1943.
1944.
In January 1944, the Brigade was used as the cadre in the formation of the 19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Latvian).

LSAT caseless ammunition

LSAT caseless ammunition is caseless ammunition produced as part of the U.S. Army’s Lightweight Small Arms Technologies (LSAT) program.
Although less advanced in development than the other ammunition component of the program, the caseless round has already produced its own outstanding results. Having replicated Dynamit Nobel's ACR ammunition, the HITP (High Ignition Temperature Propellant, which is hexogen/octogen-based to decrease heat sensitivity) ammunition was modified to a 5.56 mm round. Tests proved the ammunition's usability, and development of the weapon was advanced using knowledge gained from the cased ammunition version. The Alliant Techsystems ammunition production team has reduced the production time and costs by reducing from fourteen to two the number of steps used to complete processing. The second spiral of caseless ammunition was rolled out in 2008, with the necessary facilities to produce the ammunition in bulk completed. It has vastly reduced the weight and volume of standard ammunition (by 51% and 40%, respectively), and it has reached the verge of achieving Technology Readiness Level 5. The development of the third spiral was also initiated, with the goal of replacing the propellant binder with a binder more environmentally and cost friendly. It also aims to reduce the heat ablation on the inside of the weapon by modifying the burn rate of the propellant, and by giving the round an exterior coating to absorb or prevent transferred heat. Benefits the system has gained from using the caseless ammunition go beyond the unparalleled weight and volume reduction to, for example, the lack of ejected shells (which both improves the weapon's protection from dirt and removes any need to "police" cases after firing).
In August 2013, AAI Corporation was awarded a $2.05 million contract to continue developing parts of the LSAT program. Part of the contract is to refine 5.56 mm caseless ammunition prototypes for testing. The caseless ammunition effort will focus on improving propellant and ignition formulations in a 5.56 mm configuration.

Tony Pinkney (born 1956) is Senior Lecturer in the Department of English, Lancaster University, England. He played an active role in Oxford English Limited (OEL), a leftwing group pressing for progressive reforms in the Oxford University English Faculty between 1982 and 1992, and edited its journal, . Fred Inglis has asserted in his biography of Raymond Williams that ‘Tony Pinkney was the moving spirit of OEL’. Pinkney’s work on Raymond Williams challenged the notion of Williams as a doggedly realist writer and argued instead for his openness to certain currents in modernism and postmodernism. Pinkney’s most recent work has focused on William Morris and utopianism and he now runs a well-known blog on this topic, 'William Morris Unbound'. In August 2011 he launched the Kelmsgarth Press [http://kelmsgarthpress.com] with Makiko Minow, and he is now working on "News from Nowhere Two", a sequel to Morris's utopia.

Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Academy

Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Academy, also known as OLMHRA, is an educational institution that offers a secondary course among the youth of Loyal Victoria, Oriental Mindoro Philippines. It was founded by Msgr. Warlito Cajandig DD on June 5, 2001, under the name Good Shepherd Academy (Annex). Started with one year level composing of only 50 students. Its faculty was first composed of two Rosarian nun teachers from Roxas City, namely Sr. Ma. Frances Ruiz O. P. as Principal and Sr. Ma. Catherine Basa O. P. as the students' advisor.
First graduates.
After four years of study OLMHRA produced its first batch of graduates on March 20, 2005, with 25 students of its initial 50. The school's first Valedictorian was the late Marie M. Delica; its first salutatorian was Lorena H. Aguila.
Among the 25 graduates, only nine of them were able to pursue their study in college. Some of them went to Manila to work for their families while others remained in their native land to help their families run their businesses..
The OLMHRA.
Starting with the 2004–2005 school year, the institution decided to add its first male teacher, Fredie Rick Lopez from Pinamalayan Oriental Mindoro. Since Mr. Lopez is the lone male teacher, he holds almost every outdoor activities of the students such as ROTC, Basketball Tournaments, community services, etc.
On the same year, due to some changes in the schedule, OLMHRA hired Babylyn Gaba as a mathematics teacher for all levels as a replacement for Sr. Ma. Hyacinth Musa O. P. because of the latter's sickness. After one month of teaching, Mrs. Gaba felt unsatisfied with her salary and decided to stop teaching and to leave the institution. OLMHRA thereafter hired Ms. Milene Frio, a Bachelor of Science in Secondary Education in Mathematics major from Capiz, who replaced Mrs. Gaba. She is the second female teacher who is not a nun in the institution.

Evergreen, Volume 2

Evergreen, Volume 2 is the second album from the Stone Poneys, released five months after "The Stone Poneys". The volume number is a reference to this being the band's second album. This was the most successful of any Stone Poneys album.
Release Data.
The album was released in the LP format on Capitol in June 1967 in both monaural and stereophonic editions (catalogue numbers T 2763 and ST 2763, respectively), and subsequently, on 8-track tape and cassette (the latter being catalogue number C4-80129). In 1995, Capitol reissued the album on CD (catalogue number CDP-80129)
In 2008 – more than 40 years after this album was released – Raven issued a 27-track "two-fer" CD featuring all tracks from this album and also the band's first album (under its 1975 reissue name), "The Stone Poneys Featuring Linda Ronstadt", plus four tracks from their third album, "Linda Ronstadt, Stone Poneys and Friends, Vol. III".
Notes on the tracks.
Unlike the first album, Linda Ronstadt was the lead vocalist on almost all songs, with only occasional harmony vocals. The exception is the title song, "Evergreen" (which was also the flip side of the first single from the album); Kenny Edwards sang lead on "Part One", while "Part Two" is an instrumental. Both parts have a psychedelic rock feel and feature fine sitar playing (also by Edwards).
The album is notable for the appearance of the band's biggest hit song, "Different Drum", which was a #12 hit; the song was written by Mike Nesmith prior to his joining the Monkees. As Edwards recalled, the band based their original performance of the song on the version by the Greenbriar Boys that appeared on their 1966 album, "Better Late than Never!": "We cut a version very much like that, with mandolin, kind of a jug bandy, bluegrass-lite version." Record producer Nik Venet apparently sensed that the song could become a hit and had it re-recorded with other musicians. However, the song did not chart until November 1967 – after the band's four-month tour to support the album – and Edwards had already left Stone Poneys by then.
The first single from the album, "One for One" did not chart. The song was co-written by Austin DeLone, later a member of the seminal country-rock band Eggs Over Easy, which is credited with launching the pub rock movement in British music.
Five of the songs were co-written by bandmembers Bobby Kimmel and Kenny Edwards; unlike the first album though, Ronstadt was the lead singer on all of them. Also, Kimmel co-wrote "New Hard Times" – having the unusual theme of examining the downside of Sixties affluence – with Mayne Smith, a member of the Bay Area's first bluegrass band, the Redwood Canyon Ramblers.
Many of the other songwriters – such as Steve Gillette and Pam Polland – like the Stone Poneys themselves, were struggling singer/songwriters in the Los Angeles folk scene; the same is true of Tom Campbell and Linda Albertano, whose songs appear on other Stone Poneys albums.
Steve Gillette contributed "Song about the Rain" and "Back on the Street Again"; Gillette sung harmony vocals with Ronstadt on the latter song. Sunshine Company had their biggest hit with "Back on the Street Again" (reaching #36 on the Billboard singles chart), and Gillette included the song on his own debut eponymous album; both versions were released in 1967. More than 30 years later, the West Coast bluegrass band Laurel Canyon Ramblers (led by Herb Pederson) included the song as the title cut on their third CD in 1998.
"December Dream" - the album's opening track - was written by John Braheny who had a brief career as a singer-songwriter before moving on to other aspects of the music business. Fred Neil recorded the song in the same general time period, although it was unreleased until the 1998 double-CD compilation album "The Many Sides of Fred Neil". Braheny also included it on his own eccentric 1970 LP, "Some Kind of Change".

Aldo-keto reductase

The aldo-keto reductase family is a family of enzymes that includes a number of related monomeric NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases, such as aldehyde reductase, aldose reductase, prostaglandin F synthase, xylose reductase, rho crystallin, and many others.
Structure.
All possess a similar structure, with a beta-alpha-beta fold characteristic of nucleotide binding proteins. The fold comprises a parallel beta-8/alpha-8-barrel, which contains a novel NADP-binding motif. The binding site is located in a large, deep, elliptical pocket in the C-terminal end of the beta sheet, the substrate being bound in an extended conformation. The hydrophobic nature of the pocket favours aromatic and apolar substrates over highly polar ones.
Binding of the NADPH coenzyme causes a massive conformational change, reorienting a loop, effectively locking the coenzyme in place. This binding is more similar to FAD- than to NAD(P)-binding oxidoreductases.
Examples.
Some proteins of this family contain a potassium channel beta chain regulatory domain; these are reported to have oxidoreductase activity.

Sinéad Mulvey

Sinéad Mulvey (born 22 January 1988) is an Irish
professional singer & air hostess who, alongside Black Daisy, represented her country at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 with the pop-rock song "Et Cetera". The song was performed in the second semi-final but missed out on qualification to the grand final.
Mulvey appeared on "You're a Star" prior to Eurovision 2009, but missed out on the final.
Biography.
Early life.
Sinéad started singing at the age of thirteen, as she was picked as the star role in the musical "Cinderella". In 2005 she competed in RTÉ's talent show "You're a Star".
She works as an air hostess with Aer Lingus.
Eurovision 2009.
The deadline for submissions for the Irish selection process for the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 was 2 February 2009, with RTÉ inviting entries from as early as 20 December 2008. On 20 February 2009, Sinéad, alongside rock band Black Daisy, won the Irish pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in Moscow, Russia. Sinéad and Black Daisy beat off competition from five other contenders in "The Late Late Show Eurosong Special", receiving 78 points out of a possible 80, to earn the right to represent Ireland in Moscow. Mulvey was described as "shocked but honoured" at the triumph.
Arriving in Moscow with the RTÉ delegation prior to the semi-finals, Mulvey was photographed at various locations around the city in the company of Black Daisy and Irish Eurovision television commentator Marty Whelan and radio commentator Larry Gogan. Mulvey attired herself in a variety of costumes throughout the rehearsal period but settled for hair extensions and a black "rock chick" outfit in the style of Katy Perry meets Avril Lavigne for the semi-final performance.
The pop-rock entry "Et Cetera" was performed second during the second semi-final in Moscow's Olimpiysky Indoor Arena on 14 May 2009 but failed to reach the final. They had been the only girl band in the entire competition in 2009 and the performance had been in front of an audience of 20,000. Despite the eventual loss, the audience gave them a "rousing applause". The act received a total of 52 points finishing in 11th place.
Mulvey told the radio show "Morning Ireland", "We were so close to tenth place. We gave our heart and soul into that performance.". The singer has since said that herself and the band had received various offers, requests and invitations and has insisted that she would try representing the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest instead, starting from 2010.

Linda Ronstadt, Stone Poneys and Friends, Vol. III

Linda Ronstadt, Stone Poneys and Friends, Vol. III is the third and final album by The Stone Poneys. Linda Ronstadt would release her first solo album the following year. The volume number is a reference to this being the third album by the band, though with a Roman numeral rather than the Arabic numeral used on the previous album. While all three band members are shown on the covers of the first two albums, only Linda Ronstadt appears on the front cover of this album, while the back cover photo depicts friends surrounding Ronstadt in front a house on Hart Ave in Santa Monica CA.
As on the second album (though with a few exceptions in that case), Linda Ronstadt sings lead vocals on all tracks. While ostensibly a Stone Poneys album, "Vol. III" represents a transition between the work of this band and Linda Ronstadt's solo career. Many of the songs are in more of a country-rock style that would mark her most popular work in later years, rather than the folk-rock music of the first two Stone Poneys albums. This is particularly true of the two songs that were released as singles from this album, "Some of Shelly's Blues" and "Up to My Neck in High Muddy Water"; the latter song reached #93 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.
Release Data.
The album was released in April 1968 in the LP format by Capitol in both monaural and stereophonic editions (catalogue numbers T 2863 and ST 2863, respectively). In 1995, Capitol reissued the album on CD (catalogue number 80130).
In 2008 – 40 years after this album was released – Raven issued a 27-track "two-fer" CD simply called "The Stone Poneys", featuring all tracks from the first two albums by the Stone Poneys, "The Stone Poneys" and "Evergreen, Volume 2", plus four tracks from this album: "Hobo", "Up to My Neck in High Muddy Water", "Some of Shelly's Blues" and "Stoney End".
Notes on the tracks.
Unlike the first two albums, when they composed most of the songs, the other bandmembers, Bobby Kimmel and Kenny Edwards were the songwriters on only two of the songs. (In fact, Edwards had already left the band before work began on this album). For the remaining tracks, Linda Ronstadt sought out material by well regarded musicians such as Tim Buckley and Laura Nyro; and there are additional songs by others whose work had appeared on the two earlier albums, like Steve Gillette, Tom Campbell and Mike Nesmith. There are several previously unreleased tracks included on the album, such as the very short "fragments" that open the album.
The only charting success by the band from this material was from the single release "Up to My Neck in High Muddy Water". This is an original song by the Greenbriar Boys and appeared on their 1966 album "Better Late than Never!". This was the same album that introduced the band to Michael Nesmith's "Different Drum", their major hit song from the previous album, "Evergreen, Volume 2".
Another Nesmith song, "Some of Shelly's Blues" (sometimes spelled "Some of Shelley's Blues") was also released as a single. Michael Nesmith is best known as a member of The Monkees, and this band recorded the song in the 1960s also (though it would remain unreleased until the early 1990s). Nesmith himself included it on his solo album, "Pretty Much Your Standard Ranch Stash" (1973). "Some of Shelly's Blues" was the opening track on The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's 1971 album, "Uncle Charlie & His Dog Teddy"; and as one of two follow-up singles from this album to their biggest hit, "Mr. Bojangles", this song hit #64 on the Billboard charts. The following year, the Dirt Band backed Earl Scruggs in a cover of this song on his album "I Saw the Light with Some Help from My Friends"; and the band also included it on their 1982 live album "The Dirt Band Tonite". Mary McCaslin – who recorded another song from this album early in her career, "Aren't You the One" – included this song on her 1981 album "A Life and Time". Other versions of "Some of Shelly's Blues" have been recorded by many artists over the years, among them Continental Drifters and Bill Miller.
Several other now-familiar songs are also included on this album. The Laura Nyro song that closes the album – which came from her debut album "More Than a New Discovery" (1967) – was the title track of Barbra Streisand's 1971 album "Stoney End". The album reached #10 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums – Streisand's first Top Ten album in five years – while as a single, the song peaked at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100. Peggy Lipton also released "Stoney End" in 1968 (as a single).
"Let's Get Together" – also known as "Get Together" – is regarded today as a quintessential hippie/flower power appeal for peace and brotherhood. The song is best known as the Top 5 hit by the Youngbloods in 1969 (though it was originally released by that band in 1967); but the song was also recorded in the 1960s by many other artists ranging from Judy Collins, to Jefferson Airplane, to the Byrds. In 1965, We Five reached #31 on the singles charts with this song, which was a follow-up to their major hit "You Were on My Mind". It is perhaps surprising that the original recorded version was by the mainstream folk-pop band the Kingston Trio in 1964.
"Morning Glory" – which was on Tim Buckley's second album, "Goodbye and Hello" (1967) – was renamed "Hobo" by Linda Ronstadt (the allmusic website does not reveal any other artist that used this name for the song). In this same time period, the song appeared on Blood, Sweat and Tears' first album, "Child Is Father to the Man" (1968); and also on McKendree Spring's 1969 debut album. Fairport Convention made a live performance of the song in 1968 that was included as a bonus track on the 2003 reissue of their debut album "Fairport Convention".
The other two Tim Buckley songs come from his first album, "Tim Buckley" (1966). During her brief time with Capitol, Mary McCaslin recorded "Aren't You the One" at about the same time as the Stone Poneys' version and also using the same producer (Nik Venet); along with considerable other previously unreleased material, the song was included on her 1999 release "".
Album credits.
Linda Ronstadt is well known in the music industry for having among the most meticulous credits on her albums, particularly with regard to musician credits. As an example, both of the interior album panels on the gatefold covers in her first two greatest hits LP's listed credits for the songs on the album. Also, on the second Stone Poneys album, "Evergreen, Volume 2", a total of 22 musicians were listed, including 9 in the string section alone. However, allmusic lists only the original bandmembers in this case; and Kenny Edwards left the band before work on this album was begun (although he likely played on some of the songs that had already been recorded, such as the "Fragments").

<doc id="21634025" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21634025" title="Bodleian Library, MS Rawlinson B 502">
Bodleian Library, MS Rawlinson B 502

Oxford, Bodleian Library, Rawlinson B 502 is a medieval Irish manuscript which presently resides in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. It ranks as one of the three major surviving Irish manuscripts to have been produced in pre-Norman Ireland, the two other works being the Lebor na hUidre and the Book of Leinster. Some scholars have also called it the Book of Glendalough, in Irish "Lebar Glinne Dá Locha", after several allusions in medieval and early modern sources to a manuscript of this name. However, there is currently no agreement as to whether Rawlinson B 502, more precisely its second part, is to be identified as the manuscript referred to by that title.
It was described by Brian Ó Cuív as one of the "most important and most beautiful ... undoubtedly the most magnificent" of the surviving medieval Irish manuscripts. Pádraig Ó Riain states ".. a rich, as yet largely unworked, source of information on the concerns of the community at Glendaloughin or about the year 1131, and a magnificent witness, as yet barely interrogated, to the high standard of scholarship attained by this monastic centre."
History and structure.
The manuscript as it exists today consists of two vellum codices which were originally separate works but were bound together sometime before 1648. This was done at the request of their new owner, Irish antiquarian Sir James Ware (d. 1666), who thanks to Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh (d. 1671) had been able to assemble a fine collection of Irish manuscripts. Several leaves of paper with a (mainly) Latin commentary by Ware on aspects of Irish history (fos. 13–18) were inserted between the two manuscripts, possibly to preserve the appearance of two distinct works. Further paper folios were added at the end of the second manuscript (fos. 90–103), containing notes and transcripts of documents, part of which was written in Latin.
The first manuscript, which covers folios 1-12v (six bifolia), was compiled and written in the late 11th century or possibly at the beginning of the 12th. The fine minuscule script suggests the work of two professional scribes, and glosses were added by later hands. One of these glossators has been identified as the scribe "H" who was also responsible for adding glosses to the Lebor na hUidre. Like the latter work, this part of Rawlinson B 502 may therefore have been a product of the monastic scriptorium of Clonmacnoise, Co. Offaly.
The greater part of Rawlinson B 502, covering fos. 19–89, is taken up by a manuscript the text of which was written by a single scribe in the mid-12th century. The last king of Connacht listed is Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (r. 1106–1156).
Every leaf has two columns of text written in regular minuscule. The calligraphy, with some decoration, is of a high standard. The parchment was well prepared, though the manuscript has been subject to wear and tear and several folios are now lost. The contents of the manuscript point towards a monastic milieu in Leinster as the source of its origin. It has been proposed that Killeshin in Co. Laois was the house responsible for its production.
James Ware's collection of manuscripts passed on to his son, who sold it to the Earl of Clarendon. It was later transferred to James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos, who sold some of the manuscripts, including that known now as Rawlinson B 502, to Dr Richard Rawlinson (d. 1755). Rawlinson's collection of manuscripts was bequeathed to St John's College, Oxford, whence in 1756 it finally found its way into the Bodleian Library.
In 1909, Kuno Meyer published a collotype facsimile edition of the vellum pages, with an introduction and indices, published by Clarendon Press. By 2000, the "Early Manuscripts at Oxford University" project was launched, now entrusted to the Oxford Digital Library, which published digital reproductions of the manuscript. The scanned images include both vellum and paper leaves, with the exception of the 17th-century paper leaves found on fos. 105–171. Critical editions and translations of the individual texts, insofar as these have been undertaken, have been published separately in books and academic journals.
Contents.
The first manuscript contains an acephalous copy of the "Annals of Tigernach", preserving a fragment of the so-called Chronicle of Ireland, a world history in Latin and Irish based on Latin historians such as Eusebius and Orosius. The text is incomplete at both its beginning and end, which suggests that the twelve folios may represent only a portion of the original manuscript.
The second manuscript opens with a series of Middle Irish religious poems entitled "Saltair na Rann" ("The Psalter of the Verses"), followed by a recension of the Irish "Sex Aetates Mundi" ("The Six Ages of the World") and the poem "Amra Coluimb Chille" ("Song for Columba"). The manuscript contains many Leinster narratives belonging to the Cycles of the Kings, some of which are grouped in a section which is headed "Scélshenchas Laigen", beginning with "Orgain Denna Ríg". Among these is "Tairired na n'Déssi", the best preserved copy of the "A" version of the work known as "The Expulsion of the Déisi". Another secular group of Leinster texts, but written in verse, is the selection of poems collectively referred to as the "Laídshenchas Laigen". Other verse texts include the wisdom poems "Immacallam in Dá Thuarad" ("The Colloquy of the Two Sages") and "Gúbretha Caratniad" ("The Judgments of Caratnia"). The manuscript is also one of two pre-Norman sources for Irish genealogical texts, the other being the Book of Leinster. These genealogies, which come at the end in a sizeable section of some 30 folios, are mainly associated with Leinster, but others are integrated. Importantly, some material of Early Irish law is preserved, such as the tract "Cóic Conara Fugill" ("The Five Paths of Judgment"). For a select but more detailed list of the contents of the manuscript, expand the following table:
Disputed identity.
The identity of the second part of the manuscript, more especially its name and provenance, in sources long before it passed into the hands of Rawlinson has been a matter of some controversy.
Saltair na Rann.
Sir James Ware himself referred to the second part as the "Saltair na Rann" by Óengus Céile Dé, after the metrical religious work of this name beginning on the first folio (fo. 19): "Oengus Celide, Author antiquus, qui in libro dicto Psalter-narran" and elsewhere, "vulgo Psalter Narran appellatur" ("commonly called Psalter Narran"). Ware’s contemporaries John Colgan (d. 1658) and Geoffrey Keating (d. 1644) also appear to have used this name for the manuscript as a whole. Keating refers to this title three times throughout his "Foras Feasa ar Éirinn", citing it as his source for the poem beginning "Uí Néill uile ar cúl Choluim" in Book III. Complicating matters, this poem is not be found in Rawlinson B 502, though Breatnach draws attention to the loss of folios and the trimming of pages which may account for the poem's absence.
It is unknown whether in using the name "the "Saltair na Rann" by Óengus Céile Dé", these three writers were following a convention which significantly predated the 17th century. Caoimhín Breatnach assumes that they did, but Pádraig Ó Riain has expressed serious reservations, suggesting instead that the title may have been a convenient shorthand introduced by Ware in the 1630s and adopted by some of his contemporaries.
Lebar Glinne Dá Locha or Book of Glendalough.
A case has been made for identifying Rawlinson B 502 (second part) as the manuscript referred to in some sources as the Lebar Glinne Dá Locha or Book of Glendalough. (To make confusion worse confounded, the latter title was once mistakenly used for the Book of Leinster, too, but see there). References to this title in the manuscripts include:
The case for identification was made by scholars like Eugene O'Curry (1861) and James Carney (1964), but it has been argued most forcefully and elaborately by Pádraig Ó Riain. He observed close textual affinities between copies of texts which acknowledge their source as being the Book of Glendalough, such as the first two items above, and versions of these texts in Rawlinson B 502. Caoimhín Breatnach, however, criticises his methodology in establishing textual relationships and concludes that Lebar Glinne Dá Locha and Rawlinson B 502 are two separate manuscripts.
An important item of evidence is the poem "Cia lín don rígraid ráin ruaid", which survives in three manuscripts: Rawlinson B 502, RIA MS 23 D 17 (which attributes its copy to the Book of Glendalough) and National Library of Ireland MS G 3. In Rawlinson B 502, the poem is embedded in a section on pious kings and accompanied by a short prose introduction as well as some marginal notes. In the versions of the poem given by MS G 3 and MS 23 D 17, the scribe explicitly cites the Lebar Glinne Dá Locha as his source, but the thematic context and the accompanying texts of the Rawlinson B 502 version are found in neither of them. Breatnach suggests that these shared differences are unlikely to have occurred independent of one another, but probably derive from a common source known to both scribes as the Lebar Glinne Dá Locha.
Breatnach also points out that Geoffrey Keating, in a list of extant manuscripts known to him, distinguishes between the Saltair na Rann by Óengus Céile Dé, i.e. Rawlinson B 502 (second part), and the Book of Glendalough. Ó Riain objects, however, that Keating does not claim to have witnessed all these manuscripts in person and so might not have been aware that the manuscript he used, at least by the time he wrote Book III, was formerly known as the Book of Glendalough.

Céphas Bansah

Togbe Ngoryifia Céphas Kosi Bansah (born April 22, 1948), also known as Céphas Bansah, is the king of the Gbi Traditional area of Hohoe, Ghana. He rules his 200,000+ subjects by phone, fax, and e-mail from Germany, where he lives with his wife, Gabriele Bansah.
Biography.
Early life.
Céphas Bansah grew up in the Volta Region of Ghana, and first visited Germany in 1970 during a student exchange program. He took an apprenticeship at the firm "Paul Schweitzer" in Ludwigshafen am Rhein, and went on to earn two German Master Craftsman certificates: the first was a Master Craftsman as mechanic for agricultural machinery and the second as mechanic for vehicles. He also took up boxing in his spare time, and in 1975 became the district flyweight champion.
He has made the statement: “I had two reasons why I wanted to come to Germany: firstly, my interest in pursuing a career to use and reinforce the experience gained in my apprenticeship and secondly, to gain an insight into the "typical" German attitudes – the inflexible sense of duty, discipline, diligence, and ambition.”
Coronation.
In 1987, Bansah's grandfather, the reigning king, died, and Céphas Bansah was chosen to be the new ruler. His father and elder brother were both left-handed, and therefore could not be considered rightful heirs, because the left hand was seen as unclean. The coronation ceremony took place on 16 April 1992. Despite his new responsibilities, Céphas Bansah decided to continue living in Germany, as he felt he could do more to help his people from abroad. He now runs a workshop of his own in Ludwigshafen, and is in regular contact with his family in Ghana, who he visits a few times a year.
In an official statement Togbe Ngoryifia Céphas Kosi Bansah has explained his role as King:
“The King is head of kingdom, chief administrator of the community, and head of society. He is the custodian of the stool’s land properties and he mediates between the ancestors and the living. The King’s role is to bring unity, progress, and development to his community, and he should settle disputes and misunderstanding between people. I took this responsibility for the wellbeing of my folk knowing that it would not be an easy accomplishment.”
Charity.
Throughout the years, Céphas Bansah has been able to realize several supportive ventures. Soon after his coronation, he established a non-profit organization to raise funds for the people of Hohoe. In Ludwigshafen, he was able through his good relations with the farmers to collect containers full of water pumps and pipes. They were shipped to Ghana and served to supply many people's homes with clean drinking water. Further items such as electricity poles and a new church bell for the Hohoe Evangelical Presbyterian Church were sent in subsequent containers. The town's hospital, which had been understaffed and inadequately equipped, was much improved by donations of medical equipment, wheelchairs, ambulance vehicles, and twenty-two German doctors. The king also supervised the construction of a new bridge over the River Dayi, which had previously been dangerously unstable.
Media.
He is also known as an entertainer and musician, and makes many media appearances to generate interest for his charitable projects. He has been on many television shows with almost every German television station and as a guest on many other national and international television shows, even with the ORF (television broadcaster) in Austria. In September 1995 his installation as the "Superior and Spiritual Chief of the Ewe people" in Notse in Togo – a recognition of his hard work, development achievements, and continuous support for the Ewe people – was covered by the ZDF.
His Majesty King Togbe Ngoryifia Céphas Kosi Bansah has explained: “...people approached over and over again with questions about Ghana and about other African states. These people had never had personal contact with an African before. Their initial reservations about the continent were dispelled, and they considered me a mediator and representative for the whole of Africa. They asked for advice about traveling, for commercial contacts, and how they can be supportive in numerous developmental ventures.”
He has produced and published six CDs of his songs and music, including a version of "O Tannenbaum" in his native language, and his World Cup 2006 song "King Football". The German author Horst O. Hermanni has written a biography of Céphas Bansah with the title "Majestät im Blauen Anton" (His Majesty in Blue Overalls).
Marriage.
Céphas Bansah married his German wife, Gabrielle, in 2000, and has three children: Michael Kweku, Carlo Koku, and Katharina Akosua.

Flixton, The Saints

Flixton is a village and civil parish located in the district of Waveney, in the English county of Suffolk. It is located around south-west of Bungay to the south of the River Waveney on the Norfolk border. In 2001 the population of the civil parish of Flixton was 176.
The village was the site of a medieval Augustine priory and a World War II airfield.
History.
Flixton Priory was founded in the 13th century. The ruined remains of the moated priory are located to the south of the village near to Abbey Farm. These include sections of wall, earthworks and fishponds.
The substantial Flixton Hall was demolished in the 1950s, though not before it provided one of the backdrops for the 1947 children's film "The Secret Tunnel".
RAF Bungay was located at Flixton. The World War II airfield was built in 1942 as a base for bombers of the United States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force. At the end of the war the airfield was used as a prisoner of war camp and then by the RAF as a bomb store until its closure in 1955. Some areas of the airfield remain, including parts of a taxi way and a war memorial dedicated to the 446th Bombardment Group, nicknamed the "Bungay Buckeroos", which was based at Bungay from November 1943 until the end of the war. The Norfolk and Suffolk Aviation Museum is located in the village today.
Abbey Wood SSSI.
Abbey Wood, located to the south of the village, is an area of ancient woodland designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The site covers and includes a range of woodland species such as oak, ash and hazel as well as the rare woodland floor thin-spiked Wood Sedge, "Carex strigosa". The woods were probably once associated with Flixton abbey, the site of which borders the woods.

List of Chiefs of Naval Operations educated at the United States Naval Academy

The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) is the highest-ranking active duty member of the United States Navy and is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The CNO reports directly to the Secretary of the Navy for the command, utilization of resources and operating efficiency of the Navy. Of the 29 CNOs, 27 were graduates of the United States Naval Academy (USNA). The Academy is an undergraduate college in Annapolis, Maryland with the mission of educating and commissioning officers for the Navy and Marine Corps. The Academy is often is referred to as Annapolis, while sports media refer to the Academy as "Navy" and the students as "Midshipmen"; this usage is officially endorsed. During the latter half of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th, the United States Naval Academy was the primary source of U.S. Navy and Marine Corps officers, with the Class of 1881 being the first to provide officers to the Marine Corps. Graduates of the Academy are also given the option of entering the United States Army or United States Air Force. Most Midshipmen are admitted through the congressional appointment system. The curriculum emphasizes various fields of engineering.
This list is drawn from graduates of the Naval Academy who became CNOs. The Academy was founded in 1845 and graduated its first class in 1846. The first alumnus to graduate and go on to become a CNO was William S. Benson, who graduated from the Class of 1877. The current CNO, Gary Roughead, is also an Academy graduate. Roughead graduated from the Class of 1973. Four graduates subsequently became Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, three became ambassadors, three were recipients of the Navy Cross, and one was a recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross.
Over 990 noted scholars from a variety of academic fields are Academy graduates, including 45 Rhodes Scholars and 16 Marshall Scholars. Additional notable graduates include 1 President of the United States, 2 Nobel Prize recipients, 52 astronauts and 73 Medal of Honor recipients.

Smokin' Guns

"Smokin' Guns (SG") is a first-person shooter video game. Smokin' Guns is intended to be a semi-realistic simulation of the American Old West's atmosphere and was developed on id Software's "Quake III Arena" Engine. Gameplay as well as locations are inspired by Western movies, particularly those from the Spaghetti western genre.
"Smokin' Guns"’s codebase is free and open source software, distributed under the terms of the GPL; it is built upon ioquake3, an upgrade of the original Quake III engine. The artwork and other media are licensed under a proprietary non free license.
History and development.
"Smokin' Guns" was originally developed by Iron Claw Interactive under the name "Western Quake 3". From 2001 to 2003, Iron Claw Interactive released two versions (beta 1.0 and beta 2.0) as modifications respectively total conversions for "Quake III Arena". Further development by Iron Claw Interactive stopped after the release of version beta 2.0 in 2003.
The development was continued by a new team in 2005 in cooperation and with the blessings of Iron Claw Interactive. The new team released two additional versions of Western Quake3 (beta 2.1 in 2005 and beta 2.2 in 2006). The new team, going under the name of Smokin' Guns Productions, released "Smokin' Guns" 1.0 as a standalone version based on the open-source "Quake III" engine in January 2009. The name of the game was changed in order to avoid legal problems as well as to reflect the work of the new team since it took over development in 2005.
In June 2012 the 1.1 version was released .
Gameplay.
Smokin' Guns is a semi-realistic simulation of the "Old West's" atmosphere. The game is a so-called total conversion which was developed on the Quake3 engine. It includes new weapons created with historically correct information about damage, rate of fire, reload time, etc. Moreover, it includes new gametypes and maps inspired mostly by movies as well as a custom soundtrack.
The game differs in many aspects from similar games which are based on Quake3:

ISQ, or International School of Qingdao (mti) () is a private school located in Qingdao, China. The students are from 14 countries all over the world, including South Korea, United States, United Kingdom, Japan, China, Denmark, France, etc. ISQ is an independent, coeducational tuition-based international school which serves the expatriate community in Qingdao for grades Pre-K through 12. An American, college-preparatory curriculum is offered with English as the language of instruction.
Founded in 1996 with eight students, enrollment has steadily increased since it started, with a current enrollment of over 400 students. The current composition of the student body is 70% Korean, 15% North American, 3% Japanese, and 11% other. Twelve countries and three major language groups, Korean, English, and Chinese, are represented in the student body. 24% of the student population is native English speakers, while 76% speak English as a Second Language.
ISQ is part of the International Schools of China (ISC). ISC serves more than 1,200 students, most of whom are the children of foreign nationals and expatriates working for companies in China.
History.
Qingdao MTI International School (QMIS, now International School of Qingdao) was established by the MTI (Management Technologies International) Education Foundation, Inc., an American non-profit corporation committed to educational work in China. This included establishing international schools for expatriate children and promoting cultural understanding and exchanges. QMIS was the second of six schools to be established under the International Schools of China consortium. QMIS obtained licensing from the Qingdao Education Commission in June 1996 and the National Education Ministry on September 23, 1996.
When QMIS began in the fall of 1996, there were eight students in kindergarten through fourth grade. The school was housed in three classrooms with an office and restrooms on the second floor of the back wing of the No. 1 Middle School of High Tech Park. The school grew to thirteen students by the end of the first academic year, and by the end of the second year, the growing student population necessitated that the school relocate. In August 1998, QMIS moved to the fourth floor of the Children's Club at the Qingdao Children's Activity Center, No. 6 Donghai Road. The steady increase in enrollment required the school once more to acquire more classroom and office space at the activity center.
In the summer of 2004, QMIS' parent company, MTI, merged with Leadership Development International (LDI), another American non-profit corporation with the same commitment and vision for educational work in China. As part of the merger, MTI officially changed its name to LDi; however, there are no plans to alter the name of the school to reflect that change.
Because of its continued growth, QMIS again relocated to a larger campus. QMIS started its 2007-2008 academic year on a new campus in the Laoshan district. QMIS occupies three buildings on the campus which it shares with the private Chinese school, Baishan.

Dryandra ser. Ilicinae

"Dryandra" ser. "Ilicinae" is an obsolete series within the former genus "Dryandra" (now "Banksia" ser. "Dryandra"). It was first published by Carl Meissner in 1856, but was discarded by George Bentham in 1870. It was reinstated with a new circumscription by Alex George in 1996, but was ultimately discarded again in 2007 when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele sunk "Dryandra" into "Banksia".
According to Meissner.
This taxon was first published by Meissner in his 1856 chapter on the Proteaceae in A. P. de Candolle's "Prodromus systematis naturalis regni vegetabilis".. Meissner's arrangement followed that of Robert Brown in segregating a single species into the genus "Hemiclidia", and dividing the remaining species into three sections according to what were perceived to be variations in the number of seed separators. Meissner then further divided "D." sect. "Eudryandra" into eight unranked groups signified by the symbol "§". The first of these, Dryandra § Ilicinae, was defined as comprising four species with leaves resembling those of "Ilex" (Holly). The placement and circumscription of "D." § "Ilicinae" in Meissner's arrangement thus looks like this:
According to Bentham.
Along with many of Meissner's infrageneric taxa, which were overly reliant on leaf characters, Bentham discarded "D." § "Ilicinae" in his 1870 arrangement. The species that Meissner placed there were placed together in "D." ser. "Armatae", except for "D. floribunda" (now "Banksia sessilis") which Bentham placed in "D." ser. "Floribundae".
According to George.
When Alex George published his revision of "Dryandra" in 1996, he recycled number of previously published infrageneral names, including Meissner's "Ilicinae". George gave it series rank and placed it within "D." subg. "Dryandra". It was circumscribed as containing three species: "D. praemorsa" (now "B. undata"), "D. quercifolia" (now "B. heliantha") and "D. anatona" (now "B. anatona").
George's placement and circumscription of "D." ser. "Ilicinae", as amended in 1999 and 2005, may be summarised as follows:
Recent developments.
Since 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses have provided compelling evidence of the paraphyly of "Banksia" with respect to "Dryandra"; that is, it seems that "Dryandra" arose from within the ranks of "Banksia". Early in 2007, Mast and Kevin Thiele initiated a rearrangement of "Banksia" by sinking "Dryandra" into it as "B." ser. "Dryandra". This transfer necessitated the setting aside of George's infrageneric arrangement of "Dryandra"; thus "D." ser. "Armatae" is no longer current. Mast and Thiele have foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of "Dryandra" is complete.

Dante Love

Dante Love is an American former college football player. He played as a wide receiver for the Ball State Cardinals at Ball State University until he suffered a cervical spine fracture during a 2008 season game. At the time of his career-ending injury, Love was the 2008 season's national leader in receiving yards, and he ranked as Ball State's career kick return yards leader and second-leading receiver in terms of yards and number of receptions.
Early years.
He was born in Cincinnati, Ohio to Maxine Love on March 19, 1986. Love attended Withrow High School, where he played football as a quarterback during his last two school years. As a senior in 2004, the team posted a 10–1 record and secured the Southwest Ohio Public League championship. That season, Love threw for 2,094 yards and 20 touchdowns and rushed for 970 yards and 14 touchdowns. He was subsequently named an All-City and All-Southwest Ohio District player, Ohio North-South and Ohio East-West All-Star, and the Withrow High School most valuable player. Love was also named the City Offensive Player of the Year and the "Cincinnati Enquirer" Division III Player of the Year.
College career.
In 2005, Love enrolled at Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana and played as a true freshman wide receiver on the football team. That season, he saw action in all eleven games and recorded 19 receptions for 185 yards and three touchdowns. He also made 19 carries for 89 rushing yards. On special teams, Love returned 22 kick-offs for 545 yards, which included a 94-yard return for a touchdown against Ohio. He led the team in all-purpose yardage with 74.7 yards per game. At the end of the season, he was named co-recipient of the John Hodge Award for the team's most outstanding freshman player.
In 2006, Love played in all twelve games, to include seven starts. He recorded 52 receptions for 735 yards and four touchdowns. Love also made 19 carries for 83 yards and one touchdown and returned 13 kicks for 216 yards. He ranked second on the team in terms of all-purpose yardage with 86.2 yards per game.
In 2007, he saw action in all 13 games and started in 11. He recorded 100 receptions for 1,398 yards and ten touchdowns. He returned 49 kick-offs for 1,100 yards, to include a 100-yard touchdown return against Central Michigan. Love broke the Mid-American Conference (MAC) single-season records for both all-purpose yards with 2,690 and kick-off return yards with 1,100.
Going into the 2008 season, Love had recorded 2,318 receiving yards in three years to become the second leading Ball State receiver behind only Dante Ridgeway. He was also the leading Ball State kick return specialist with 1,862 yards. Love had played in all 36 games during his career and made at least one reception in 35 of them.
In 2008, Love played in each of the first four games. In the season opener against , he made nine receptions for 171 yards and one touchdown and rushed for 22 yards and another touchdown. Against Navy, he again had nine receptions for 165 yards and two touchdowns. He made six carries for 37 yards and one rushing touchdown. Against Akron, he caught seven reception for 97 yards.
Injury.
On Saturday, September 20, for their fourth game, the Cardinals traveled to Bloomington to face the Indiana Hoosiers. At that point, Love led the nation with 144.3 receiving yards per game. Love made two catches for 25 yards in the first half. With 10:45 left in the second quarter, quarterback Nate Davis threw a short 2-yard pass to the right for Love on a swing route. He made the reception and ran to the outside and along the sideline. An Indiana linebacker grabbed onto Love's shoulder pads from behind, which caused him to lower his head as he pushed forward for more yards. An Indiana cornerback, Chris Adkins, made the tackle from the front and Love fell to the ground with the ball being knocked loose. Hoosiers safety Nick Polk recovered the fumble and returned it for a touchdown. Love remained on the ground for several minutes and reported that his legs were numb. He had suffered a cervical spine fracture (broken neck). After about fifteen minutes, he was placed on a spineboard and taken to the locker room by a motorized cart. Love was then transported by ambulance to Ball Memorial Hospital and then by helicopter to Methodist Hospital of Indianapolis. Doctors showed Love x-rays of his fractured neck and informed him that he may eventually walk again, but would never be able to play football. That night, doctors performed a five-hour surgical procedure to stabilize his spine. After the surgery, Love was able to move his arms and legs.
Ball State went on to win the game against Indiana for the school's first-ever victory over a Bowl Championship Series (BCS) conference school. Head coach Brady Hoke called it the biggest win in school history during a greatly abbreviated post-game press conference. Hoke cut it short in order to visit Love in the hospital.
While unable to play, Love regained the use of his limbs, and on October 25, he returned to assist the team's coaches during the 2008 season. After the season, Hoke resigned as head coach to take the same position at San Diego State and was replaced by offensive coordinator Stan Parrish. Parrish said that he would hire Love as a graduate assistant for the 2009 season as he works towards his undergraduate degree.

The club was founded in 1884. During the early 1900s Underbank unearthed rugby league legend Harold Wagstaff who would go on to be the first name on the Rugby League’s Hall of Fame.
A Holliday Cup and promotion double was achieved in 1981/82 when Neil Fox was player / coach.
angers struggled in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as the establishment of the rival Newsome club took its toll. However, the club achieved a two-year revival at the end of the 1992/93 season, culminating in winning the Holliday Cup and gaining promotion to the Pennine Premier Division.
Season 1999-2000 witnessed the Rangers finish second, their highest ever position, in the Pennine League Premier division. The following season, 2000-2001, again saw Rangers riding high in the Premier Division and top of the table at Christmas. However, the club suffered badly with the foot and mouth crisis, the ground was closed and the nomadic Rangers won only one of their last nine matches. The next couple of seasons witnessed the Rangers struggle and they couldn’t maintain their Pennine Premier League status.
They were founder members of National League Three in 2003, in which they competed as "Huddersfield Underbank Rangers". They went on to finish sixth out of the ten competing teams. Seasons 2004 to 2006 saw the team miss out on the play-offs.
The league was renamed Rugby League Conference National Division and came within the Rugby League Conference structure in 2007. Rangers improved and finished fifth and reached the play-offs before losing in the second round at Warrington Wizards. The team again finished fifth in 2008 exiting the competition in the first round of the play-offs after a defeat at Featherstone Lions.
They were among nine clubs invited to join the National Conference League for the 2013 season. They reverted to the original "Underbank Rangers" name.

Tinnakill Duanaire

The Tinnakill Duanaire (Trinity College Dublin MS 1340) is an early seventeenth-century manuscript "prized for its important collection of bardic religious verse". It is believed to have been compiled for Aodh Buidhe Mac Domhnaill (1546–1619) of Tinnakill, County Laois, Leinster, who is the subject of one of its poems, along with his brother, Alasdar (d. 1577). The poem concerning Aodh Buidhe — "Le dís cuirthear clú Laighean" — is thought to have been composed about 1570 by Muircheartach Ó Cobhthaigh.

Jens Hoffmann (filmmaker)

Jens Hoffmann is a German director, writer and cinematographer.
History.
Hoffmann had his start in the mountains with a 16 mm camera. Having grown up in the Black Forest region of Germany, he started skiing at an early age and it quickly became a significant part of his life. As he traveled to distant mountain ranges, it became difficult to find a cameraman who was skilled enough and willing to partake in the adventures so he started to operate the cameras himself. In the early 1990s he began studying journalism in Munich and got his first job in the industry working as a producer and journalist in sports television.
After five years in television, of which two were spent with the Formula One circuit, he was offered a position as Assistant Director and Executive Producer for Willy Bogner Films. This was his first chance to work on a major film with a big budget. This included IMAX cameras and huge set ups. He made several movies for the sports industry and commercials.
In 2000, he started his own production company: F24 Film. Though he continued to produce commercials and corporate movies, he began to focus more on feature-length documentaries that branched into more personal portrayals. His first of this kind was about his former boss, Willy Bogner, entitled "Portrait of a Filmmaker", in 2000.
In 2002, he began working on "20 Seconds of Joy", the story of Karina Hollekim. In 2008, the filmmaker stepped into the world of documentary film with a screening of "20 Seconds of Joy" at HotDocs in Toronto, Canada.
Since 2004, Jens has received several awards for his work on commercials and corporate movies, including the official city profiles for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. His documentary, "Fatima’s Hand", has received 16 international awards, including Best Documentary on Sports at the Banff Film Festival in 2006. He won the award again in 2007 with "20 Seconds of Joy", and in 2008 with "Journey to the Center". His movie, "9to5 – Days in Porn", had its world premiere at the Montreal World Film Festival in 2008; it also had screenings at the Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival, and the Miami International Film Festival.

Iraq–European Union relations

Iraq – European Union (EU) relations refers to the international relations between the Republic of Iraq and the EU. Relations have been strained from the early 1990s but are now gradually progressing. Should Turkey's accession to the EU take place, Iraq will border the European Union.
Background.
Differences in the European and U.S. approaches to the issue of Iraq began to emerge in the 1990s. This period, following the expulsion of Iraq from Kuwait in 1991, was characterized by a policy of containment. Alongside this policy, however, the United States became progressively more involved in advocating democracy for Arab states, a process which had no parallel in Europe. The slow movement in Washington from a policy of containment to one of regime change reached a significant milestone in 1998, with the Clinton Administration passing the Iraq Liberation Act. No parallel movement took place in Europe.
European opposition to a policy of regime change in Iraq meant that little deliberation had taken place in Europe as to what a post-Saddam Iraq may look like. There was also a pronounced wariness in continental Europe regarding the Iraqi opposition. Even a December 2002 conference on the subject of democracy in Iraq had to be moved from Brussels to London because of the sensitivity of the subject for continental Europeans. In Britain, the country closest to the United States on Iraq, relations between Iraqi oppositionists and official circles were few.
Europe's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) came into being following the Maastricht Treaty in 1993. In 1999, the CFSP was solidified through the creation of the position of its high representative. The Iraq crisis was the most significant test with which the CFSP had yet been required to contend. Iraq, however, saw the EU failing to act as one. Rather, the approach of real crisis resulted in the major powers of the EU splitting; with France and Germany opposing the U.S.-led plans for invasion of Iraq; and the UK aligning itself firmly alongside America and committing troops to the invasion. Other European countries sided with either position, many contributing to the multinational force in Iraq.
Divisions in the approach to 2003 Iraq war.
Concern at the ambitions of the Saddam Hussein regime and at the possibility that Iraq was concealing aspects of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) program from United Nations inspection teams was common to the United States and all member states of the European Union. On the basis of this shared concern, Security Council Resolution 1441 was passed on November 9, 2002, with the appearance of unity within the EU. Evidence of a differing orientation toward the use of force among EU countries, however, was already discernible.
France and Germany.
In France and Germany, the willingness to break openly with Washington on this issue was particularly noticeable from the outset. The U.S. Administration noted and was angered by the use of populist anti-war rhetoric made by then German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in his bid for re-election in September 2002. It was the first sign of a new atmosphere of mutual impatience and exasperation between the United States and certain countries in Western Europe. United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's much-quoted comments made at this time differentiating between "Old Europe", (France and Germany) and "New Europe", (countries of Central Europe), who were more sympathetic to America's stance on Iraq, confirmed the attitude of mutual suspicion emerging between the U.S. Administration and the French and German governments.
As military action began to look more and more inevitable in the first months of 2003, French President Jacques Chirac became the main spokesman for the view that UN weapons inspectors needed more time to search Iraq for banned arms. He backed a request by the UN's chief nuclear weapons inspector, Mohamed ElBaradei, for an extension of "several months." The French president noted that his country was coordinating its positions closely with Germany. Germany indeed voiced its opposition to a UN Security Council vote on military action and, unlike France, indicated that it would oppose any request for UN support for military action.
The French desire to act as a counterweight to the United States on the international stage is a perennial feature of international affairs. Germany, however, has been among the most pro-U.S. countries in Europe, and so its emergent opposition to the U.S. stand on Iraq was more surprising. It may be seen as an aspect of Berlin's increasing desire to play an independent, assertive role in international affairs in line with its own public opinion, as well as very deep skepticism in Europe regarding the reasons for war with Iraq.
UK and Spain.
Opposed to the emergent Franco-German alliance against the war were countries representing both "Old" and "New" Europe, in Secretary Rumsfeld's terms. In the former category, both UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar were firmly with the U.S. view regarding the supposed danger represented by Iraq. There was clear resentment on the part of both these men for what they regarded as the high-handed attitude of the French president and the sense in which his attitude seemed to imply a situation of natural French leadership in Europe.
Blair placed more stress than did the United States on the need for a clear international mandate for action over Iraq, and was a leading voice in arguing for a second UN Security Council resolution before any further steps were taken. This position was vital from the point of view of the British prime minister's domestic standing, but in practice served only to sharpen the differences between the British and French positions, rendering less likely the possibility of a joint European response.
The rift between the UK and France over the Iraq question cast into bold relief two starkly different positions regarding the role of Europe in world affairs. Thus, broadly supportive of the French and German position were Belgium, Greece, Luxembourg, and neutral states such as the Republic of Ireland. In the Atlanticist corner, meanwhile, apart from the UK were to be found Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, as well as Portugal and Denmark. The support of Central European and Baltic EU member states for the U.S. position, as declared in February 2003, served to anger the French and led to President Chirac's famous outburst that the government of these countries had 
"missed an excellent opportunity to keep silent."
These differing stances did not remain on the declarative level alone. With no second UN resolution forthcoming, the UK, along with Spain, Poland, Italy, and the Netherlands, committed troops to the invasion of Iraq. The war thus proceeded without the second UN resolution desired by the UK and with the open opposition of France and Germany. These latter countries found themselves in an unlikely alliance with Russia over the war.
EU and European states policy on Iraq following the invasion.
Politics and diplomacy.
Following the invasion and the destruction of the Saddam Hussein regime, the initial stance taken by France, as the main Western opponent of the war, was for the rapid ending of the U.S. and British occupation, and, in its place, the creation of a UN administration of Iraq. The subsequent failure of the United States and its allies to find the Iraqi WMD, over which the war was fought, formed an important backdrop to the subsequent stance taken by France and Germany. It has been noted that France and other European countries were keener on UN involvement in Iraq than the UN itself.
The French were also highly critical of the political arrangements put in place by the United States following the war. On April 5, 2003, French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin was scathing about U.S. plans for reconstruction in postwar Iraq. The French foreign minister criticized the United States for the issuing of contracts to U.S. companies. Iraq, he said, should not be seen as a "paradise for invaders", or a pie in which all could have a finger. De Villepin's statements were made at a joint press conference with the German and Russian foreign ministers and are indicative of the atmosphere of anger and suspicion engendered by the war.
For France and its anti-war allies, the issue of the rapid recovery of Iraqi sovereignty and the ending of the American occupation was paramount from the outset. For the UK, leader of the pro-war faction among European countries, the most pressing diplomatic problem following the war was preventing further deterioration in U.S.-EU relations. The British had their own criticisms of U.S. handling of the occupation in the first months. There were differences with the United States over military tactics, with British observers critical of the performance of the 3rd Infantry Division in Baghdad, and particularly of the performance of the team under General Jay Garner, who for a short period administered postwar Iraq. 
Despite these misgivings, the British commitment of troops in Iraq remained the most significant after that of the United States.
On June 28, 2004, power was formally handed over by CPA Head Paul Bremer to an interim Iraqi government to be led by Ayad Alawi. The handover took place in secret, against the backdrop of the continuing insurgency and bloodshed in Iraq.
France again led the charge in its trenchant criticism of the new arrangements emerging after June 2004. The French were critical of the make-up of the new government, which they maintained did not represent a sufficient departure from the previous, U.S.-led administration.
From June 2004, the beginnings of a more general cautious re-engagement of EU countries with the new Iraq can begin to be discerned. A strategy paper produced by the EU the same month recommended an active European engagement with the new Iraqi government. The document envisaged the EU inviting Iraq to join the EU's Strategic Partnership for the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It also recommended that EU states join in pushing for Iraq to be admitted to the World Trade Organization, and that the EU should reinstate favored trading partner relations with Baghdad.
The essential dividing line in European perceptions on Iraq ran between France and Germany on one hand, and Britain, Poland and Spain on the other. Smaller neutral countries then tended to align with France and Germany, and a number of new member states were with the UK, Poland and Spain.In mid-2004, however, following José María Aznar's defeat in elections by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, Spain effectively crossed over to the other camp. Zapatero announced his intention of withdrawing his country's forces from Iraq. Spain had committed a force of 1,400 troops. Zapatero, demonstrating his fealty to the French view of events in Iraq, initially stated that he might be willing to see Spanish forces stay as part of a UN-led solution in Iraq. Since this was clearly not on the horizon, he ordered their withdrawal, which began on April 20, 2004, and was completed within six weeks.
The announcement on November 22, 2004 of elections in Iraq played a further important role in the slow, cautious re-engagement of European countries. Holland, which had supported the war and which held the EU presidency in the year 2004, was keen to promote practical assistance in the elections. A mission was sent with the intention of exploring the possibility of European monitors taking part in the Iraqi polls.
In the run-up to the elections, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell publicly expressed his hopes that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which played an important role in supervising elections in Ukraine, would undertake similar tasks in Iraq. This did not take place, however, the responsibility for international supervision of the elections of January 30 was undertaken by a relatively small group of 35 UN staffers. The European Commission donated the sum of 31.5 million Euros toward preparation for the elections, which included a training program for Iraqi observers of the electoral process and the deployment of three European experts to Baghdad to work with the UN mission. The small size of this group was attributed to the problematic security situation in Iraq. In addition, an ad hoc group called the International Mission for Iraqi Elections monitored the electoral process from Jordan, because of fears related to the security situation. This mission included members from Britain, but no other EU country.
The elections were hailed as a success and the model of genuine but limited European support for the political process in Iraq was established, and has not been substantially deviated from in subsequent landmark events in Iraq. Thus, EU involvement in the referendum on the constitution consisted of a 20 million Euro contribution toward the constitutional process, which again was channeled through UN bodies working on the referendum. The successful conduct of the referendum was welcomed by European governments and by the Commission. Yet direct European involvement was not a feature of the referendum process.
The "hands off" policy of France, Germany, and the countries that had opposed the war seemed to them to be justified by the failure to return stability to Iraq following the toppling of Saddam Hussein. Further defections from the pro-U.S. camp took place in 2006. Elections in Italy in May 2006, brought back to power a coalition led by the Socialist Party. The new prime minister, Romano Prodi, used his first speech in parliament following his victory to issue a harsh criticism of the war in Iraq. He referred to it as a "grave error" that could ignite war across the Middle East. Prodi announced his intention to withdraw Italy's commitment of 2,700 troops in Iraq. This, together with the substantial cutting down of the Polish contingent in Iraq, left the United States with its British allies almost alone in attempting to maintain their commitments in Iraq.
European economic relations with Iraq.
European funding and aid for the reconstruction of Iraq has been limited. Once again, the opposition of principal European countries to the invasion has been the key factor here. At the Madrid donor conference in October 2003, shortly following the invasion, the total of $33 billion was contributed for the reconstruction of Iraq. Of this sum, fully $20 billion came from the United States, $5 billion was donated by Japan, and $1 billion by the UK. France declined to make any contribution. In total, $1.5 billion was donated by other EU member states. European levels of aid to the new Iraq have remained at a modest level. The European Commission as a body has donated 518.5 million Euros. Individual contributions have varied according to the stance toward the war taken by the country, but have remained overall low.
In November 2004, the sensitive issue of Iraq's public debt was addressed in an agreement between the new government in Iraq and Paris Club member states. A major debt reduction plan was agreed upon, which would bring the debt down by 80 percent over three phases, linked to Iraq's compliance with the International Monetary Fund standard program.
Regarding trade with Iraq, the United States is its main trading partner, with 40.7 percent of the total amount traded. The EU is second, with 20.7 percent. The EU is also the second largest exporter to Iraq. Regarding imports, as Iraqi oil production has picked up, so energy exports to Europe have correspondingly increased. Iraq is now tenth among the major energy supplies to Europe. Iraq is responsible, however, for only 1.4 percent of the total of European energy imports. There is thus a long way to go before pre-1991 levels of trade are regained. Trade fell sharply in 1991, before picking up again after the beginning of the oil-for-food program in 1997. By 2001, the EU accounted for 33.3 percent of overall trade and 55 percent of Iraq's imports, after which it began to decrease once again.
European economic engagement with Iraq is thus increasing, and can be expected to continue to increase depending, ultimately, on the level of stability in Iraq. European aid for reconstruction in Iraq, however, has been modest, and here political factors are significant. Countries that opposed the war have been reluctant to contribute largely to the rebuilding of Iraq in a process that they regarded as fundamentally illegitimate. The French refusal to make a donation of any kind at the conference in Madrid in October 2003 offers perhaps the clearest example of this.

William Charles Fahie

Vice-Admiral Sir William Charles Fahie KCB (1763 – 11 January 1833) was a prominent British Royal Navy officer during the American War of Independence, French Revolutionary War and the Napoleonic Wars. Unusually, Fahie's service was almost entirely spent in the West Indies, where he had been born and where he lived during the time he was in reserve and in his retirement. After extensive service in the Caribbean during the American War of Independence, during which Fahie impressed with his local knowledge, Fahie was in reserve between 1783 and 1793, returning to service to participate in Sir John Jervis' campaign against the French West Indian islands in 1794.
Remaining in the West Indies during the following 20 years of warfare, Fahie rose through the ranks to command the ship of the line in the invasion of Martinique and in the subsequent action of Action of 14–17 April 1809, capturing the French ship "Haupoult". In 1810 he participated in the invasion of Guadeloupe and transferred to European waters for the first time since 1780. At the end of the war Fahie remained in service and eventually became commander-in-chief of the Leeward Islands. He retired in 1824 and was subsequently knighted, settling in Bermuda with his second wife.
Life.
Fahie was born in Saint Kitts, one of the Leeward Islands, the son of a judge and part of a prominent family of Irish settlers. In 1777, aged 14, he was sent to serve in the Royal Navy during the American Revolutionary War, joining under Captain John Colpoys. Within a year he had moved to , later transferring again to Sir George Rodney's flagship . On "Sandwich" he was engaged in the Battle of Cape St Vincent off Southern Spain in 1780. Appointed lieutenant in the aftermath of the action, Fahie returned to the West Indies on , serving at the Battle of Martinique and the Battle of Saint Kitts. Due to his knowledge of the island, Fahie was selected to take messages to the besieged garrison on Saint Kitts but was briefly captured in the attempt, before being released. He later served at the Battle of the Saintes.

The Stoneman Murders

The Stoneman Murders is a 2009 Indian film based on the real life Stoneman serial killings that made headlines in the early 1980s in Bombay. The hapless victims of the mystery killer, who was never caught, were footpath dwellers in Bombay. They were stoned to death in their sleep. The movie weaves fiction around reality in an attempt to provide answers to the questions around the case. "The Stoneman Murders" was director Manish Gupta's first full-length feature film.
Plot.
The serial killer dubbed 'Stoneman' by the media has just claimed his fifth victim and the case is still of little interest to the Bombay police. But to suspended sub-inspector Sanjay Shelar (Kay Kay Menon), this killer poses an opportunity. Sanjay hopes to track the killer down and, thus, possibly find an entry back into the police force. With the secret aid of his patronizing superior AIG Satam (Vikram Gokhale), Sanjay takes up the arduous process of tracking the murderer. The official police investigator of the case Kedar Phadke (Arbaaz Khan) clashes incessantly with Sanjay they, separately, delve deeper into the case. Sanjay is determined to find the stoneman. He takes the help of his informer. His wife Manali (Rukhsar) is upset with him and thinks that he is having an affair. One night someone throws a stone into Sanjay's house through a window. Manali thinks it to be the mischief of boys of the locality; Sanjay feels it is the stoneman. Another night the stoneman tries to kill a beggar sleeping on the roadside but is saved by Kedar and some patrolling policemen. Sanjay and his car is spotted by Kedar. Sanjay finds that his investigation house has been visited by the stoneman as sees vermilion spread everywhere.
Sanjay contemplates a possible danger to his wife asks her to leave for her village. He rushes to the station to get her rail ticket where he encounters. Before he can catch him Kedar shoots him thinking him to be the killer. Sanjay escapes and the incident brings him closer to his wife. He suspects the killer to be a policeman who is a tribal performing an impotency ritual and asks the informer to tell this to Satam. Kamle (Virendra Saxena) turns out to be the killer and attacks Sanjay, but both are saved by the police. Kamble is arrested and the matter is closed. In the end it is shown that the man with a voice similar to Satam is performing a ritual and asks a person to give him nine offerings of humans and this time to kill people in Calcutta.
Production.
The research that went into the scripting of "The Stoneman Murders" involved an intensive search for newspaper articles dating to 1983 (when the killings took place). The director Manish Gupta and his team combed the Asiatic Library, the Government Archival Library at Elphinstone College, the "Times of India" archives and the archival departments of "Indian Express", "Maharashtra Times", "Navbharat Times" and other newspapers. Before this, the preliminary research done by the director was over the internet where a few articles about the Stoneman had been posted. The dates obtained from the internet were later used to carry out the more detailed research in the libraries and newspaper archives.
Before the shooting of the film, the director and his team visited nearly all the known murder sites, like the area surrounding Tilak Hospital in Sion, the Gandhi Market near King's Circle, the area outside Matunga police station, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road in Wadala and one small street in Lalbaug. The visits to these sites were made late at night to enable the creative team to absorb a feel of the area and the eerie late-night ambience, which was later recreated in the film in terms of location selection, photography and the general styling of the film.
The production team had to re-create the look of 1980s Bombay despite the fact that cars, shops and advertisements had changed. The pavements where the murders took place were made of black tar unlike the multi-coloured jigsaw shaped tiles of today. This restricted the shooting in myriad manners. For the wide shots of pavements, the unit often had to cover half a kilometre of pavement with black tarpaulin sheets to achieve the look of a tar footpath. The unit often waited until late night before rolling the camera since they needed all modern vehicles off the roads. Often some vehicles remained parked on the road and had to be covered by black tarpaulins. Likewise, the neon hoardings and contemporary advertisements were hidden by 1980s style advertisements and film posters that were sourced out painstakingly by the art director from obscure raddi shops. 
The sound design of the film was also done after thorough research. Hit film songs from the period depicted were used along with famous radio jingles and TV commercials of that era.
Reception.
Nikhat Kazmi of "Times of India" gave "The Stoneman Murders" a 3-star rating out of 5 and praised it for its gripping story and taut performances. "The film has an ample thrill quotient with the shadowy frame of the stoneman flitting across on one hand and the police department, specially Arbaaz Khan, holding the renegade cop, Kay Kay Menon, as the prime suspect. Once again, Mumbai and its alleys which turn sinister by night, tower prominently as the perfect backdrop of a film which boast of some high-tension moments. But the real lure is Kay Kay's full bodied portrayal of the trigger-happy cop who is wedded to his duty, yet doesn't mind a bit of black money."
Nithya Ramani from rediff.com praises "TSM": "Writer-director Manish Gupta does a wonderful job in telling the story, which has a very realistic touch. Despite being a murder mystery, Gupta avoids gore and bloodshed, and makes it visually appealing. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat, occasionally sending a chill down your spine."
Noyon Jyoti Parasara of AOL India gave the movie a 2.5 out of 5 and said, "Overall, The Stoneman Murders is an honest portrayal of 'what could have been'. But it's not as gripping as it should have been. Nonetheless it's a novel concept and worth a watch…for Kay Kay, if nothing else."

Marguerite, Baroness de Reuter

Marguerite, Baroness de Reuter (July 14, 1912 – January 25, 2009) was a European aristocrat, who was the last survivor of the family which founded the Reuters news service. 
Marguerite was the widow of Oliver, 4th Baron de Reuter, whose grandfather, Paul Julius Reuter, established the Reuters news service in London in 1851. Paul Julius Reuter, a Jew who settled in the United Kingdom and converted to Christianity, had previously begun his career in journalism in Aachen, Germany, using carrier pigeons and telegraphs. 
Marguerite was born on July 14, 1912. She was the daughter of George Uehlinger of Neunkirch, Switzerland. Marguerite was a widow for the last 40 years of her life. A patron of the arts, Marguerite was a champion of her family links with Reuters, and of her British citizenship, which she acquired through marriage to her late husband, Oliver, 4th Baron de Reuter. She and her husband had no children.
Her personal interests, especially in the arts, continued well into her older years. She actively continued to ski until her 70s. She was known to be fluent in several languages. Her hobbies included bridge, as well as attending opera and ballet.
Marguerite suffered from a series of successive strokes late in 2008. She died on Sunday, January 25, 2009, at a French nursing home near the border with Monaco at the age of 96. 
The title she bore was created on September 7, 1871, when the German Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha conferred a barony (Freiherr) on Julius Reuter, her grandfather-in-law.The title was later confirmed by Queen Victoria as conferring the privileges of the nobility in England. The title became extinct upon the death of her husband, the 4th Baron de Reuter, who left no heir. 
Tom Glocer, the chief executive of Thomson Reuters at that time, released a statement upon Marguerite's death saying, "Although the founding family of Reuters were no longer significant shareholders in the company, the baroness did notably attend a service at St Bride's Church, London, to mark Reuters' historic move from Fleet Street to Canary Wharf in 2005."
Reuters New Agency moved out of its headquarters on Fleet Street in 2005. The company became part of Thomson Reuters plc in 2008.

Totus Tuus (Górecki)

"Totus Tuus" Op. 60 (English: Totally Yours) was written for unaccompanied mixed choir by the Polish composer Henryk Górecki in 1987. Górecki composed the piece to celebrate Pope Saint John Paul II's third pilgrimage to his native Poland that summer, and the work remains his best-known, if not critically acclaimed, a cappella choral piece of the 1980s. The work was first performed in on June 14, 1987 at a High Mass held in Victory Square, Warsaw by the Choir of the Warsaw Academy of Catholic Theology.
The libretto was taken from a poem written by contemporary writer Maria Boguslawska which is addressed to the Virgin Mary, the patron saint of Poland. "Totus Tuus"'s form is ABA'CD, and marks a return to the simple homophony characteristic of Górecki's earlier Marian Songs. The composition's texture utilises homophony to allow for a clear voice for the libretto, while the simple chant form is repeated to slowly build a musical affirmation of faith. Gorecki used a homophonic texture in other Marian compositions such as 1985's Marian Songs, Op. 54, and Under your Protection, Op. 56. This simplification of texture also occurs in Gorecki's most famous work, Symphony No. 3, where a similarly simple, diatonic language is employed to evoke the sparse and repetitive mood of Holy minimalism.

Military Intelligence Directorate (Syria)

The Military Intelligence Directorate (, "Shu'bat al-Mukhabarat al-'Askariyya") is the military intelligence service of Syria. Although its roots go back to the French mandate period (1923–1943), its current organization was established in 1969. Its predecessor organisation was called the "Deuxième Bureau". It is headquartered at the Defense Ministry headquarters in Damascus.
The military intelligence service, or the "Mukhabarat" in Arabic, is very influential in Syrian politics and is controlled by the President. It is suspected of providing support to different radical groups. Additionally, the service monitors dissidents of the government outside Syria. During the Syrian occupation of Lebanon, the Mukhabarat exercised political authority in Lebanon. 
Late Assef Shawqat, the brother-in-law of Bashar Al-Assad, became director in 2005 replacing General Hassan Khalil. From 2009 to 2012, the military intelligence service was headed by Abdel-Fatah Qudsiyeh, who like Syrian President Assad is a member of the Alawite community.

Children of the revolution (concept)

Children of the revolution is a concept associated with the generation growing up after revolutionary activity. It refers to the first generation of persons born after a revolution. The children of the revolution are a blank slate on which the values of the revolution are imposed. Because the generation have no shared memory of the prior world they cannot compare the new system with the old and will uncritically accept the new system as the natural order.
The phrase usually refers to political revolutions, but is also applied to revolutions in culture, science, or art.

Novruz in Azerbaijan

Novruz in Azerbaijan () is a traditional holiday, which celebrates the New Year, and the coming of Spring. When Azerbaijan was part of the Soviet Union, celebration of Novruz was generally unofficial, and at times even prohibited. Currently in Azerbaijan, Novruz is treated as an official public holiday. In accordance with Article 105 of the Labour Code of Azerbaijan passed in 2006, workers receive five days off for Novruz.
Usually preparation for Novruz begins a month prior to the festival. Each of forthcoming 4 weeks is devoted to one of the four elements and called accordingly in Azerbaijan. Each Tuesday people celebrate the day of one of the four elements - water, fire, earth and wind. People do house cleaning, plant trees, make new dresses, paint eggs, make national pastries such as shekerbura, pakhlava, shorgoghal and a great variety of national cuisine. Wheat is fried with kishmish (raisins) and nuts (govurga). As a tribute to fire-worshiping every Tuesday during four weeks before the holiday kids jump over small bonfires and candles are lit. On the holiday eve the graves of relatives are visited and tended.
Novruz is a family holiday. In the evening before the holiday the whole family gathers around the holiday table laid with various dishes to make the New Year rich. The holiday goes on for several days and ends with festive public dancing and other entertainment of folk bands, contests of national sports. In rural areas crop holidays are marked.
The decoration of the festive table is khoncha, a big silver or copper tray with Samanu placed in the centre and candles and dyed eggs by the number of family members around it. The table should be set, at least, with seven dishes.

Le dís cuirthear clú Laighean

Le dís cuirthear clú Laighean is a poem found only in the Tinnakill Duanaire on folio 34r. It was composed for the brothers Aodh Buidhe Mac Domhnaill and Alasdar of Tinnakill, Queen's County, by Muircheartach Ó Cobhthaigh. It dates from about 1570.
In the poem, Ó Cobhthaigh refers to the brothers as heroes and Gallowglass leaders. Aodh Buidhe is accorded the most attention, while his wife Máire Ní Mhórdha is the subject of three additional quatrains.
Neither brother is referred to as Mac Domhnaill (i.e., the head of the clan), and Raghallaigh suggests it may have a bearing on a possible dispute between Aodh Buidhe and Alasdar for the chieftainship. While Aodh Buidhe is given laudatory praise, Alasdar is portrayed as a 'fearsome warrior' who is nevertheless subordinate to his brother. Nevertheless, Alasdar succeeded on the death of their father, An Calbach, in 1570. He held the position till his death in 1577, following which Aodh Buidhe succeeded him. 
The dunaire.
A dunaire were poem-books composed in Gaelic Ireland, usually concerning members of a single family. The Tinnakill Dunaire is presently held in Dublin, where it is listed as Trinity College Dublin 1340. The likely patron was Aodh Buidhe himself. 
The poem.
The first verse is quoted as follows; the translation is by Eoghan Ó Raghallaigh, cited below.
Le dís cuirthear clú Laighean;
clú 'na gcumaidh ní fogar;
ní tbarr dáibh nach dleag[har;
mall treabhadh cáigh 'na gcomar.
The fame of the men of Leinster is spread by two men; fame comparage with theirs is not to be found; they are entitled to their pre-eminence; others progress slowly in comparison with them'.

Bahá'í Faith in Japan

The Bahá'í Faith in Japan begins after a few mentions of the country by `Abdu'l-Bahá first in 1875. Japanese contact with the religion came from the West when was living in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1902 converted; the second being .
In 1914 two Bahá'ís, George Jacob Augur and Agnes Alexander, and their families, pioneered to Japan. Alexander would live some 31 years off and on in Japan until 1967 when she left for the last time The first Bahá'í convert on Japanese soil was in 1915. `Abdu'l-Bahá undertook several trips in 1911-1912 and met Japanese travelers in Western cities, in Paris, London, and New York. ‘Abdu'l-Bahá met Fujita in Chicago and Yamamoto in San Francisco.
`Abdu'l-Bahá wrote a series of letters, or tablets, in 1916-1917 compiled together in the book titled "Tablets of the Divine Plan" but which was not presented in the United States until 1919. Fujita would serve between the World Wars first in the household of ‘Abdu'l-Bahá and then of Shoghi Effendi. In 1932 the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in Tokyo and reelected in 1933. In all of Japan there were 19 Bahá'ís.
In 1937 Alexander went on Bahá'í pilgrimage to return years later. In 1938 Fujita was excused from his services in Haifa out of fears for his safety during World War II and returned to Japan until 1956. In 1942, back in the United States, the Yamamoto family lived at a relocation camp during the war. Bahá'í Americans associated with the American Occupation Forces reconnected the Japanese Bahá'í community — Michael Jamir found Fujita by 1946 and Robert Imagire helped re-elect the assembly in Tokyo in 1948. In 1963 the statistics of Bahá'í communities showed 13 assemblies and other smaller groups.
In 1968 Japanese Bahá'ís began to travel outside Japan. In 1971 the first residents of Okinawa converted to the religion. In 1991 the community organized an affiliate of the Association for Bahá'í Studies in Japan which has since held annual conferences, published newsletters, and published and coordinated academic work across affiliates. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 15650 Bahá'ís in 2005 while the CIA World Factbook estimated about 12000 Japanese Bahá'ís in 2006.
Early period.
The first mention of Japan in Bahá'í literature is with the Secret of Divine Civilization written by `Abdu'l-Bahá in 1875. It was written to try to enlighten Persia. It says:
…the government of Japan was in the beginning subject to and under the protection of China, and that now for some years, Japan has opened its eyes and adopted the techniques of contemporary progress and civilization, promoting sciences and industries of use to the public, and striving to the utmost of their power and competence until public opinion was focused on reform. This government has currently advanced to such a point that, although its population is only one-sixth, or even one-tenth, that of China, it has recently challenged the latter government, and China has finally been forced to come to terms. Observe carefully how education and the arts of civilization bring honor, prosperity, independence and freedom to a government and its people.
Firsts.
Bahá'ís moved across Asia from the turn of the century. Bahá'ís were in Shanghai in 1902, Philippines by 1944, Taiwan and Canton in 1949, and Macau in 1953. However, for the Japanese contact with the religion came from the West. Kanichi Yamamoto was living in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1902 where a Bahá'í, Elizabeth Muther, introduced him to the religion. Yamamoto wrote a letter to `Abdu'l-Bahá and enters the history books as the first Japanese Bahá'í — the second and third being Saichiro Fujita and Kenzo Torikai. The first Bahá'ís to visit Japan were Mason Remey and Howard C. Struve on December 27, 1909 who addressed an audience at a Tokyo YMCA. D. T. Suzuki's wife, Beatrice, had multiple contacts with the Bahá'ís both in America and in Japan and was for a time considered a Bahá'í. Bernard Leach lived in Japan from 1909-1920 working on the Mingei arts and converted to the religion in 1940. Leach received awards for his continued work in Japanese folk arts in the 1960s and 70s. A few other Bahá'ís traveled through Japan in 1911 and 1914. But in 1914 two Bahá'ís, George Jacob Augur and Agnes Alexander, and their families, pioneered to Japan. Alexander would live some 31 years off and on in Japan until 1967 when she left for the last time and much of her work would be through Esperantists and connections with the blind community of Japan. Meetings for the public were set up and talks and interviews were given including to Esperantist audiences. The first Bahá'í convert on Japanese soil was Kikutaro Fukuta in 1915, followed by the blind Russian youth Vasily Eroshenko who later drifted to communism. Also in 1915, Martha Root arrived for the first time in Japan and Tokujiro Torii converted to the religion. Torrii later served as president of the Japanese Blind Association and received an Imperial Citation, the Medal of the Third Order, for his work on behalf of the blind.
Cities where Bahá'ís traveled in this early phase include Kobe, Kyoto, Tokyo, Hiroshima and this period also saw the first observances of the Bahá'í Holy Days of Naw Ruz and the Declaration of the Báb. In the spring of 1916 Fukuta and Eroshenko made the first contributions towards raising the first Bahá'í House of Worship being raised in Wilmette, Illinois, USA. In the summer of 1916 Eroshenko took a copy of Some Answered Questions with him when he traveled to Siam and Burma. The first Japanese woman to convert to the religion was Yuri Mochizuki in 1919. Shortly before the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá in 1921, Alexander and Oh Sang Sun made a trip from Japan to Korea, then under Japanese rule, for the first entry of the religion in that country. Alexander also spent time with Shibusawa Eiichi. Elsewhere Fujita served as a secretary to Bahiyyih Khanum in communicating the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá in late 1921. At a time when women speaking in public was rare, two women, a Miss Mochizuki and Haruko Mori, spoke at the memorial service of the death of 'Abdu'l-Bahá held in Japan.
`Abdu'l-Bahá meets.
The Japanese Ambassador to Spain was staying in Paris when `Abdu'l-Bahá stayed there on his 1911 trip to the west and they met and had a prolonged conversation. In London in 1912, ‘Abdu'l-Bahá came in contact with the President of the Japan Women's University. It was this occasion that 'Abdu'l-Bahá wrote the only prayer he wrote for the Japanese. It says:
O God! The darkness of contention, strife and warfare between the religious, the nations and the people has beclouded the horizon of Reality and hidden the heaven of Truth! The world is in need of the light of Guidance! Therefore, O God! Confer Thy favor so that the Sun of Reality may illumine the East and the West.
In New York he met several Japanese as well. On September 12, ‘Abdu'l-Bahá reached Chicago. Fujita attempted to connect with ‘Abdu'l-Bahá at Cleveland but caught up with him in Chicago. Fujita would accompany ‘Abdu'l-Bahá across many American cities including Kenosha, Wisconsin, St. Paul and Minneapolis, Minnesota, Denver and Glenwood Springs, Colorado, Salt Lake City, Utah, and San Francisco and Stanford, California - Fujita would serve between the World Wars first in the household of ‘Abdu'l-Bahá and then of Shoghi Effendi. On October 22, ‘Abdu'l-Bahá reached San Francisco where he met Yamamoto who arranged for a presentation among a Japanese audience in Oakland.
`Abdu'l-Bahá writes to Japan and Korea.
In all `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote 18 tablets to Japanese living in Japan, and the last one was to the Koreans dated November 5, 1921. Eighteen of the nineteen Tablets were addressed to young people, and seven of these to girls of Tokyo. It is remarkable that the only Tablets to women in Asia were to three Japanese girls: Yuri Mochizuki who received three Tablets, Haruko Mori and Mikae Komatsu, each received one, and the group of girls who were sent two Tablets. ‘Abdu'l-Bahá made mentioned especially to the blind of Japan. He addressed five Tablets to three blind men.
`Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan.
`Abdu'l-Bahá wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917 suggesting Bahá'ís take the religion to many places; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan but were delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 — after the end of World War I and the Spanish flu. These tablets were translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in "Star of the West" magazine on December 12, 1919. One tablet says in part:
O that I could travel, even though on foot and in the utmost poverty, to these regions, and, raising the call of “Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá” in cities, villages, mountains, deserts and oceans, promote the divine teachings! This, alas, I cannot do. How intensely I deplore it! Please God, ye may achieve it.…
…if some teachers go to other islands and other parts, such as the continent of Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, also to Japan, Asiatic Russia, Korea, French Indochina, Siam, Straits Settlements, India, Ceylon and Afghanistan, most great results will be forthcoming.
Growth to WW II.
The Bahá'ís in Japan were witness to, and participated in the relief effort of, the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. Moneys and letters of concern arrived from Bahá'ís in New York, Haifa, Kenosha, Wi., Brooklyn, Chicago, Somerville, Mass., Montreal, Canada among other places spreading encouragement and reporting on or actually sending funds Bahá'ís and others had marshaled for the relief effort. In 1927 Siegfried Schopflocher visited Japan and reported the religion was firmly established and progressing.
In 1932 the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in Tokyo. There was a preliminary election that corrected when Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, specified rules that needed to be followed for the election. The members of the community of Tokyo were (former Rev.) Sempo Ito; Yuri Mochizuki Furukawa; Otoe Murakami; Kanae Takeshita; Mr. Y. Kataoka (first name unknown); Keiji Sawada; Agnes Alexander; Antoinette Naganuma; Mr. Nakanishi (first name unknown); Hidehiko Matsuda; and Keiko Eito. The first nine names were elected to the provisional Local Spiritual Assembly but the later official election changed adding Mr. Matsuda, who took the place of Mr. Y. Kataoka, who asked to be relieved. The members included five women and two who were blind. The assembly was reelected in 1933. In all of Japan there were 19 Bahá'ís. In 1916 Daiun Inouye was a young Buddhist priest when he first heard of the religion. In 1932 he translated Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era and it was printed the following year. In 1937 he resigned from the priesthood and wrote that he would be free to spend his time propagating the Bahá'í Faith.
Starting in the 1920s, Alexander began various trips and coming contact with public figures in Japan and some publications reached a broader audience. In 1923 Alexander first visited Hong Kong and returned on several more over the next thirty years. Alexander also accompanied Root on one of her return trips to the area - this time on a trip to China and Alexander made contacts among the Chinese, especially from Canton and Shanghai, who visited Japan as well. In 1928 seven specially bound volumes of Bahá'í books were presented for the coronation of the emperor Hirohito and were part of his library and at the Enthronement Ceremonies of His Majesty the Emperor of Japan three foreigners were invited to speak, including Alexander as a Bahá'í representative. In 1932 Esperantist Tadashi Watanabe invited Alexander to talk about the Bahá'í Faith and Esperanto first in Tomakomai, and then the then-village of Yamabe, Hokkaido.
Crisis of WW II.
In 1937 Alexander went on Bahá'í pilgrimage and, aware of the impossibility of returning to Japan during the Second World War, traveled to other countries. In 1938 Fujita was excused from his services in Haifa out of fears for his safety during the war and returned to Japan until circa 1956. In 1942 back in the United States the Yamamoto family lived at a relocation camp during the war. Two children — one from Nagasaki and one from Hiroshima — later converted to the religion and have shared their story.
Bahá'í Americans associated with the American Occupation Forces reconnected the Japanese Bahá'í community — they were Michael Jamir, Lorraine Wright and Robert Imagire. Jamir in particular undertook trips to find Torii and Fujita circa 1945-6. Imagire arrived in 1947 and was given an address where Alexander had left her printed materials and found the only building still standing after the bombing still held two hundred copies of "Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era" in Japanese. In 1948 Imagire helped re-elect the assembly in Tokyo. While all the Japanese members of the Assembly were new Bahá'ís and eventually drifted into inactivity the assembly itself was continually re-elected and remains today.
Alexander was able to return to Japan in 1950 after being sponsored by Lt. J.C. Davenport (USAF) and in 1951 four American pioneers were elected to the Tokyo Local Spiritual Assembly. The Japanese membership then was Miss Ichige, Mr. Kadota, Mr. Horioka, Miss Nakanishi and Mr. Yoshino. The Americans were Alexander, Lane Skelton, Barbara Davenport and Imagire. The assembly designated goal areas to take the religion — Yokohama, Sendai, Osaka, Hiroshima and Kofu and established eight committees with attention ranging from re-translating "Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era" to coordinating membership record keeping and the arrival of Persian pioneers. The Moghbel and Katirai Persian families arrived in 1953. In 1954 the community was 52 adults — 10 were Americans and 13 were Persians. Barbara Sims, one of the American pioneers, was elected to the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tokyo in 1954 and served for many years on that body and authored several books on the history of the Bahá'í Faith in Japan.
The first center owned by the Bahá'í assemblies in Japan was in Amagasaki in 1953. The Tokyo assembly bought a house and it became the second Bahá'í Center in 1954. The third one was in Osaka. In 1956 there were eight assemblies in Japan and the community had marshaled resources to publish a Japanese language Bahá'í "Geppo" (monthly newspaper) which was also read in Korea. In 1957 Sims was elected to the first regional National Spiritual Assembly of North East Asia, and Alexander was appointed as one of the Hands of the Cause, a position which she held the rest of her lifetime.
Post-War growth.
In 1963 the statistics of Bahá'í communities showed 13 assemblies, 9 groups of Bahá'ís, and 31 isolated Bahá'ís.
Toshio Suzuki became a Bahá'í near 1963 and would later serve on the National Spiritual Assembly of Japan and his brother, Hideya Suzuki, serve as the first Japanese Continental Counselor. In 1965 Alexander fell and broke her hip. She convalesced in Japan for two years and returned to Hawaii where she died in 1971. The first Bahá'í Cemetery — a division of a larger cemetery — was established in 1958. The first burial there was in 1964 and represented a departure from socio-Buddhist norm of cremation. In 1968 Masaaki Ushibata traveled outside Japan for Bahá'í purposes and in 1975 became the first Japanese pioneer — to the Eastern Caroline Islands. In 1969 the Japanese Bahá'ís arrange for the first National Youth Conference in Jogashima. In 1971 the first residents of Okinawa converted to the religion. There were some marriages between Japanese Bahá'ís and other nationalities which sometimes faced racism in Japanese society.
American pioneers continued to play a role in Japan into the 1990s. In 1974 Sims was elected to the first National Spiritual Assembly of Japan, serving until 1993. Sims also had contact with Ainu Bahá'ís including notably chief Takeichi Moritake (1902–1976) and son Kazutomo Umegae (1924–1992).
Modern community.
Since its inception, the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived.
Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. The modern Bahá'í community of Japan has grown and developed strength in diverse interests. The Japanese census does not have questions regarding religion however the Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 15,700 Bahá'ís in 2005 while the CIA World Factbook estimated about 12000 members in 2006. In 2005 there were 31 delegates to the National Convention to elect the National Spiritual Assembly of Japan.
In 2000 Japan rose in support of a United Nations human rights resolution about concern over the Bahá'ís in Iran as well as taking steps to further document conditions.
Academics.
In 1991 the community organized an affiliate of the Association for Bahá'í Studies in Japan which has since held annual conferences, published newsletters, and published and coordinated academic work across affiliates. In the 1999 "Yerrinbool Report on Scholarship" various Japanese academics are noted: Landegg Academy had a faculty member, Seinan Gakiun, from the University in Japan, Nozomu Sonda published a revision to an introductory book in Japanese, Mary Noguchi who chaired the 8th conference, Tsunoi Hiroshi who chaired the 2008 conference, Sandra Sims Fotos chaired several of the conferences, physicist Stephen R. Friberg, several of whom also worked on the University Club Committee. The conferences have been held in places like Waseda University, Sapporo, Tokyo, Yokohama, Yamaguchi, and Kyoto. Several Bahá'ís work with the University of Maryland University College in Asia (UMUC-Asia). Ruth Lattimore is the mathematics academic director living in Yokota base in Tokyo. Irene Chung is assistant to UMUC-Asia’s area director for Korea and was a Continental Counselor for Korea, Japan, and Thailand. Richard Dowling is an associate professor for UMUC–Asia teaching modern American and European history living in mostly in South Korea, but with some time in Guam, Japan, and Australia. Nicholas Mayer is an elementary school teacher at Nagoya International School in Japan.
Arts.
There are a number of Bahá'í artists who have done work who lived in Japan.
Diverse involvements.
Ambassador Ryozo Kato spoke on 4 September 2005 after a week-long celebration of the role played 100 years ago by a prominent US Bahá'í, Sarah Farmer, who held a conference in 1904 which closed with a program dedicated to the resolution of the Russo-Japanese War by the 1905 Treaty of Portsmouth.
Representatives of Japanese Baha'i Community visited the Risshō Kōsei Kai headquarters in Tokyo where the President Nichiko Niwano and the representatives spoke of the importance of interreligious cooperation. The Filipino Bahá'ís hosted a regional conference of Bahá'ís in 2008 including over 300 Bahá'ís from Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, Caroline Islands, Mariana Islands, and Marshall Islands attending

This film was released 8 times in Taiwan and 11 times in Hong Kong and won 4 Golden Horse Awards. The theme song "Any Empty Wine Bottles For Sale" () by Su Rui is also famous.
Da Cuo Cue (搭错车)(2005) is a popular 22 episodes TV series produced in Mainland China rewritting the film plot starring Li Xuejian (李雪健) and Li Lin (李琳).
Plot.
The movie centres around the lives of a speech-impaired army veteran and his adopted daughter. He works as a bottle recycler either buying used bottles or picking up discarded bottles with his tricycle wagon. He lives within a shanty ghetto part of the city with his woman companion who is dependent on him bringing back a bottle of saki every evening. He is affectionately known as "Uncle" in the ghetto.
One morning, on one of his daily collection trips, he chanced upon an abandoned baby girl in a basket with an attached note that says "Please give baby Mei a good home." He brings baby Mei home to raise as his own.
However, his companion is visibly upset with the presence of baby Mei and with the attention he lavishes on baby Mei. The next evening, rather than his usual spending a portion of his daily proceeds on a bottle of saki, he decides to buy a can of powdered condensed milk for his adopted baby.
On reaching home, his enthusiasm is dashed along with the can of condensed milk his companion throws on the floor when his companion discovers she would have no saki but milk for the evening. His companion grows violent and bruises his eye. The next evening, on his return, he enthusiastically brings home a bottle of saki, but his home is silent. His companion had decided to leave him and had left baby Mei with a neighbour.
Mei's adopted father dotes on her and makes her the centre of his life. Her neighbourhood is also very protective of her. Along with the joys and travails of the shanty neighbourhood Mei shared with her father, she grows up into a beautiful young woman.
Mei meets a singer-song writer and they traverse the bar scene as a singing couple. They are talent-spotted by a record producer-manager who is looking out for new blood to replace his aging artiste. However the record producer only wants Mei, not her composer boyfriend.
Mei signs a contract with the producer as her manager. Her manager reinvents Mei's image by masking her native and Taiwanese Hokkien linguistic origins but portraying her as a product of a rich and respectable family who has since emigrated to the United States but that Mei had decided to stay behind to pursue her singing career. In doing that, her manager decided to sever her ties to her family, ghetto and native origins.
Mei's popularity explodes while her boyfriend singer-song writer languishes along with her father and friends. Her neighbours are upset that she has abandoned her father in her pursuit of fame and fortune. She goes on a regional concert tour. On her return, her neighbours and dad shows up at a publicity party her manager threw for her. Her manager denies her relationship with her father at the publicity party. She shuns her father and friends.
One evening, on an attempt to visit her father, she realises she had not even known that her shanty ghetto had been forcibly demolished by city authorities and that she is unaware of the location to which the city had relocated her neighbourhood. Coincidentally, his father's former girlfriend comes asking her about the whereabouts of a friend she has missed for twenty years but both Mei and her father's former girlfriend is unaware of their linked relationships.
Her father grows depressed and reflects on the years of attention he doted on her daughter. He collapses from depression and hypertension while watching her concert on TV until his neighbours. He is brought to the hospital dying and his widowed neighbour, with whom he has grown intimate, rushes to the concert to get Mei's attention to inform her of her dying father. Mei rushes but reaches the hospital too late. She breaks down in tears.
On the aftermath of her father's demise, an abruptly dejected Mei receives a set of song scripts from her estranged composer boyfriend. Her boyfriend had embedded native lyrics into the song which would remind her of her native origins and the devotion her father had for her, rather than the faux origins her manager had projected. The native words are her father's bottle-recycling call "Any bottles to be sold (for recycling)?" She takes up the challenge to sing the song which forms the musical crescendo of the movie.
Social-political backdrop of the plot.
The movie was released in 1983 amidst rejuvenated native Taiwanese sentimentalities and the gradual liberalisation of Taiwanese cultural and linguistic behaviour from the strangle hold of Taiwanese mainland-Chinese dominated authoritarian government, and the cultural tensions between citizens of mainland Chinese and native Taiwanese origins. It also depicts, for the first time in Taiwanese cinema, the controversial process of demolition-and-relocation.

Soon after Adnan and Bihter get married, Firdevs comes to live with the family.

Adnan offers Nihat a job in his office, to which Nihat agrees and Hilmi becomes furious. He swears to ruin Nihat and Adnan's lives.
Nihal is not very happy with her father's decision of marrying Bihter. She wanted him to marry her French nanny Mrs. Deniz Mademoselle. 
Bihter and Adnan starts living a happy life. Bihter tries to be good towards Adnan's children. Now everything is going well. Bihter gets pregnant with Adnan's child. Her mother Firdevs becomes excited and says this child will ensure Bihter's position in Ziyagil family. But Bihter is not ready for the child so early. She talks to Adnan about it that his children have not accepted Bihter yet. She wants to give them more time so they can get attached with her completely. He says we will talk later on it and also that he will be with her in her decision but he wanted to think over it again. Bihter aborts the child without informing Adnan and he gets tensed. Some problems between Bihter and Adnan arise due to this but then these are resolved.
Beşir is the Ziyagil family's driver who had been living with the family since he was six years old. Adnan raised him along with Nihal. He was also Nihal's childhood friend. Beşir secretly loves Nihal and can go to any length to see a smile on the innocent Nihal's face. Nihal, on the other hand is madly in love with Behlül, but only Mademoiselle is aware of it. Cemile, the daughter of Ziyagil family's cook Süleyman and his wife Şayeste, has feelings for Beşir.
Everybody knows Behlül is a playboy. Bihter even hated him since he left Feyker. But as she lives in the Ziyagil house she starts noticing how handsome and young he is and on the other side Behlül has the same feelings for her. Behlül eventually falls in love with her. Bihter rejects but later accepts.
Behlul buys a small house on the riverside but only Bihter is aware of it. Bihter often goes there to meet Behlul. Besir, however, discovers this and secretly captures a video of Behlul and Bihter. But he fears that if he shows this to the family, Nihal would be heartbroken. Therefore he just leaves the Ziyagil House without informing anyone. 
Behlul breaks up with his girlfriend Elif Meryem and comes closer to Bihter. However, he soon realizes that he has made a great mistake and starts avoiding Bihter. Bihter now finds it impossible to live without Behlul. 
Firdevs senses change in Bihter's attitude. She uses her maid Katya to spy on her daughter and her family. Firdevs soon discovers everything about Bihter-Behlul affair. She also gets to know about Nihal's feelings for Behlul and tries to bring Nihal and Behlul closer to each other. Nihal soon reveals that she loves Behlul. Behlul is shocked to hear this because he only loved her as his sister. Soon Besir finds out that he has lung cancer. The Ziyagil family somehow finds him and he tells Behlul that he knows about his and Bihter's affair and that if he doesn't marry Nihal and keep her happy, he will reveal everything to Adnan. Behlul soon gets engaged to Nihal and Besir is happy to see Nihal happy. Adnan's sister Arsan takes Besir to her home so that she can take care of him.
Heart-broken and devastated Bihter confronts Behlul. He tells Bihter that their relationship is over, and that he will marry Nihal so as to rectify his mistakes. Bihter, knowing that he loves her and is marrying Nihal only out of guilt, breaks down in front of her mother. She says that she is dying and begs her mother to stop the wedding. Firdevs helped her but couldn't stop the wedding. Bihter also discovers that she is pregnant with Behlul's child, but she aborts it when she sees that Behlul is not ready to accept her.
Behlul is caught in a dilemma. He is ashamed of himself for deceiving his fatherlike uncle and in guilt he leaves Bihter, for whom he had broken off his engagement with Elif, and gets engaged with Nihal.
A day before Behlul's wedding, Bihter asks him to run away with her but he coldly rejects her. As a last resort, on the day of wedding, Bihter confronts Behlul, pointing a gun towards herself, and asks why did he prefer Nihal over her, why did he choose to hurt her instead of hurting Nihal. She asks him whether he will be able to live after losing her and he says "no" but does not have the guts to take the gun from her hand.
Adnan breaks into his bedroom and sees them together. He scornfully reminds Behlul that he treated him like his son. Upon realizing that Behlul does not have the courage to defend his love, Bihter kills herself. She dies for forbidden love. After her death, Behlul visits her grave, asking for forgiveness over his cowardice. He admits that he always loved her and that he is her murderer and of everyone else, nothing would have ended this way if he wasn't the coward man that he was, and that it is his punishment that he will have to live with this guilt forever. Behlul leaves Ziyagil family. Firdevs goes into shock over her daughter's death and ends up being paralyzed. She blames herself for snatching her daughter's love from her which resulted in her death.
Adnan moves into a new house with his children, Mademoiselle and the servants(Suleyman, Shayesta, Nesrin, and Cemile) while Nihal is on the path of recovery after Behlul's betrayal.

Slum tourism

Slum tourism is a type of tourism that involves visiting impoverished areas. Originally focused on the slums of London and Manhattan in the 19th Century, slum tourism is now becoming increasingly prominent in developing nations, including India, Brazil, Kenya, Indonesia
History.
The "Oxford English Dictionary" dates the first use of the word ""slumming"" to 1884. In London, people visited "slum" neighborhoods such as Whitechapel or Shoreditch in order to observe life in this situation. By 1884 wealthier people in New York City began to visit the Bowery and the Five Points area of the Lower East Side, neighborhoods of poor immigrants, to see "how the other half lives." 
In the 1980s in South Africa, black residents organized "township tours" to educate the whites in local governments on how the black population lived. Such tours attracted international tourists, who wanted to learn more about apartheid.
In the mid-1990s, international tours began to be organized with destinations in the most disadvantaged areas of developing nations, often known as slums. They have grown in popularity, and are often run and advertised by professional companies. In Cape Town, South Africa, for example, upwards of 300,000 tourists visit the city each year to view the slums.
Prior to the release of "Slumdog Millionaire" in 2008, Mumbai was a slum tourist destination.
The concept of slum tourism has recently started to gain more attention from media and academia alike. In December 2010 the first international conference on slum tourism was held in Bristol. A social network of people working in or with slum tourism has been set up.
Recently, DUNS from the MIDWEST began to tour slums in NYC, Chicago, and San Francisco.
Locations.
Slum tourism is mainly performed in urban areas of developing countries, most often named after the type of areas that are visited:
Motivations.
A 2010 study by the University of Pennsylvania showed that tourists in Mumbai's Dharavi slum were motivated primarily by curiosity, as opposed to several competing push factors such as social comparison, entertainment, education, or self-actualization. In addition, the study found that most slum residents were ambivalent about the tours, while the majority of tourists reported positive feelings during the tour, with interest and intrigue as the most commonly cited 
feelings. Many tourists often come to the slums to put their life in perspective.
Criticism.
Slum tourism has been the subject of much controversy. Both critiques and defenses of the practice have been made in the editorial pages of prominent newspapers, such as the "New York Times", "Wall Street Journal", London "Times", and others. A primary accusation that the advocates against slum tourism make is that it “turns poverty into entertainment, something that can be momentarily experienced and then escaped from.” Kennedy Odede, a Kenyan, wrote in the "New York Times" Op-Ed section, “They get photos; we lose a piece of our dignity.” Similar critics call the tours voyeuristic and exploitative. Slum tourism critics have also cited the fact that Christmas and Valentine's Day as common times for slum tourism further supporting the belief that Westerners often visit slums just to "feel better about themselves" during those holidays when most people are with families and significant others.
The tours provide employment and income for tour guides from the slums, an opportunity for craft-workers to sell souvenirs, and may invest back in the community with profit that is earned. As the debate over the ethics of slum tourism continues, studies are being done. Forums for discussion are being created to further the dialogue and provide reliable information.

<doc id="21634780" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21634780" title="Mario Duschenes">
Mario Duschenes

Mario Duschenes, CM, LL.D. (27 October 1923 – 31 January 2009) was a Canadian flautist, recorder player, music educator and conductor.
Early life.
Mario Duschenes was born in Altona, near Hamburg, Germany in 1923, the son of Franz and Grete Duschenes. He studied the recorder (musical instrument), sight singing and the piano before the age of twelve. In 1935, he began studying the flute with his father and brothers. Escaping Germany just prior to World War II, he studied flute, composition and conducting at the Geneva Conservatory in Switzerland, and during the period 1943–7 completed his training with Henri Gagnebin, André Pépin, Frank Martin, Dinu Lipatti and Isabelle Nef. Duschenes won the Conservatory's Prix de Virtuosité in 1946, and the first prize at the 1947 International Competition for Musical Performers in Geneva.
Career.
Duschenes toured Europe as soloist with the Ars Antiqua Ensemble, and emigrated to Montreal, Canada in September 1948, sponsored by his older brother, Rolf. He quickly became active in the Canadian musical scene, and in August 1949, staged and narrated the Canadian première of Stravinsky’s Histoire du soldat at McGill University. He became principal flute of the CBC Radio Orchestra, and appeared as a soloist with the Musica Antica e Nuova, the McGill Chamber Orchestra and the Pro Musica Society. He was a founding member of the Baroque Trio of Montreal, which toured extensively, and made more than 30 recordings, including several with his friend and fellow flautist Jean-Pierre Rampal. Between 1970 and 1985, Duschenes hosted ""Initiation à la musique avec Mario Duschenes"" on Télévision de Radio-Canada. 
Much of Duschenes' career was dedicated to inspiring a love of music among young people. He was an expert in the Carl Orff teaching method, and his work was also influenced by his marriage to a child psychologist, Ellyn Simons, whom he wed in 1951, and with whom he had five children. He was the author of widely distributed and highly regarded works of musical education, notably the "Method for the Recorder" I (1957) and II (1962), the "School Recorder Method" (1957), and "Studies in Recorder Playing" (1960). He also wrote and edited other works, including studies for alto recorder, and arrangements of works from the renaissance and baroque periods, of Johann Sebastian Bach, and of Leopold Mozart.
In 1953, Duschenes co-founded the CAMMAC (Canadian Amateur Musicians/Musiciens Amateurs du Canada) Music Centre in the Laurentians near Montreal, where he taught for many years. Between 1954 and 1970 he also taught at McGill University, and subsequently at the University of Montreal between 1970 and 1973. 
Duschenes became a conductor of young people's concerts for many professional orchestras across Canada. He performed the role for the Quebec Symphony Orchestra (1969–73), the Montreal Symphony Orchestra (1970–81), the National Arts Centre Orchestra (1973–88), the Toronto Symphony Orchestra (1976) and at the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra in 1985. His gracious, avuncular contribution to the musical education of youth was much praised: the music critic for the Globe and Mail wrote that ""For all the simplicity of Duschenes's language, he manages to achieve an intellectual level that patronizes neither the children nor their parents,"" while that of the Montreal Gazette noted that Duschenes was ""probably doing more for the image of young people's concerts than anyone else in Canada"". The concerts he hosted and conducted were remembered and admired for their excellence years after they took place.
Duschenes also conducted regular orchestral concerts for the Montreal Symphony Orchestra (1973–85), the Orchestre de Chambre de Radio-Canada, and in 1985 was appointed the music director of the Newfoundland Symphony Orchestra, a position he held until 1992. He also appeared as guest conductor for other major Canadian orchestras, as well as the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra in 1987, 1989 and 1990. 
Aged 85 and following a stroke, Duschenes died in Montreal on 31 January 2009.
Honours.
Duschenes received the Canadian Music Council Medal in 1978 and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1985 for his work as an internationally-known flautist, teacher and conductor. He was also awarded honorary doctorates from Concordia University (Montreal) and Memorial University of Newfoundland (St. John's).

World's Largest Cedar Bucket

The World's Largest Cedar Bucket is a red cedar bucket. The bucket is approximately tall, has a diameter at its base and at its top.
History.
The bucket was built in 1887 by the Tennessee Red Cedar Woodenworks Company from Murfreesboro, Tennessee. It was originally displayed in Murfreesboro, until it was displayed at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair and the 1904 Saint Louis World's Fair. The cedar bucket factory burned in 1952, and local grocer Crigger’s Market bought the item to display it. It was auctioned off approximately in 1965 and it was purchased by a Rossville, Georgia amusement park. It was brought back to Murfreesboro in 1976 to be displayed at Cannonsburgh Village.
Arson.
On June 19, 2005, the bucket was burned by arsonists. The fire was put out before any adjacent buildings were burned down. Roadside America describes the condition of the bucket as "Severely damaged, the bucket is now blackened and splintered charcoal shards held together by metal bands." As of 2007, the bucket has not been restored. Members of the Rutherford County Blacksmiths’ Association pledged in 2005 to restore the bucket, but they have been unable to locate high quality red cedar.
The arson of the bucket led to the final question in the 2009 Great Midwest Trivia Contest. The question was "Who was going to be married next to what was the "world's largest cedar bucket" in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, in June, 2005, before it mysteriously burned down the week before the wedding date?" The answer was James Walters and Jaki Neubauer.
Rebuilding.
On October 22nd, 2011, a refurbished bucket was unveiled at the 35th annual Harvest Days Festival in Cannonsburgh Pioneer Village. In a partnership between Roy Haney’s sawmill in Cannon County and the Rutherford County Blacksmiths’ Association, high quality, rare red cedar was collected to restore the bucket to its former glory.

Ramkrishna Dalmia

Ramkrishna Dalmia (7 April 1893 – 26 September 1978) was a pioneer industrialist and founder of the Dalmia-Jain group or Dalmia Group and The Times Group. The name is variously written as Ram Krishan Dalmia and Ram Kishan Dalmia.
Life.
Early years.
Ramkrishna Dalmia was born 7 April 1893 in the small village of Chirawa in Rajasthan. He belonged to a family of vaishnava devotee.
He shifted to Calcutta with his parents at an early age where he learned Bengali.
When Dalmia was only about 18 years of age, his father died leaving no property. After this, the entire burden of supporting his mother, grandmother, his wife and younger brother Jaidayal fell on him. His maternal uncle, Motilal Jhunjhunwala gave him a job in his bullion business which enabled him to earn just enough to support his whole family. Later he earned himself handsome amount of money by speculation in bullion.
Dalmia started a trading business in 1930s at Dinapore near Patna in the State of Bihar.
Sugar factory.
During the time when he was staying in Dinapore, he mooted the idea of establishing a sugar factory at Bihta in Patna District. This was done under the joint management of himself and Nirmal Kumar Jain of Arrah, a well-known local Zamindar. Simultaneously he set up another sugar factory at Dehri-on-Sone, Bihar. This place became known as Dalmianagar.
Cement Industry.
His greatest contribution was in the emergence of the Indian Cement Industry. He entered this field in the year 1936 as a challenge to the monopoly of existing firms, mainly the powerful combine of Associated Cement Company, which had till then been in complete control of the industry. Facing stiff competition from them, he set up several cement factories at different places like Dalmianagar in Bihar, Karachi in Pakistan, Dalmia Dadri in Haryana, Dandot in Punjab, Dalmiapuram in Tamil Nadu and Sawai Madhopur in Rajasthan.
Others.
He went on to set up several industries like Cement, Paper, Banks, Insurance Companies, Biscuits, Aviation Companies, Railways, Collieries, Publishing and Newspapers, Textiles, Chemicals, etc. with the assistance of his lieutenants, his younger brother Jaidayal Dalmia and his son-in-law, Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain.
Later, he established the Bharat Bank with branches at many places in India. He also entered in the Aviation Business and acquired disposal goods after the Second World War. He acquired interests in the Bharat Insurance Co. Ltd. and established a Fire and General Insurance Company. He later acquired controlling interests in the Punjab National Bank and also in the Times of India publications.
Division.
At the time of India’s independence, he was among the wealthiest and most powerful men in India and maintained good relations with most political leaders. At one point his name is said to have been considered for India’s finance minister
Shortly before independence, the Dalmia empire was divided between himself, Jaidayal Dalmia, and son-in-law Shanti Prasad Jain, who had once been a tutor to his daughter Rama. Later, when he was facing imprisonment and needed to repay 2.5 crores (25 million) rupees, he mortgaged Bennett, Coleman to Shanti Prasad Jain to raise monies.
Philanthropy & Extra-Curricular.
A great philanthropist, he presided over a number of religious, educational and social conferences and helped thousands of people in distress. He formed the Anti-Cow Slaughter League and vowed that he would sacrifice the consumption of cereals till all cow slaughter came to an end in the country; which promise he maintained till his last day. He mooted the idea of “One-World Government” in 1948 which received wide attention. He was also author of ‘A Guide To Bliss’, ‘Fearlessness’, ‘Faith in Divine Law’. He was a man of vision and courage.
Bennett Coleman and incarceration.
In 1947, Dalmia engineered the acquisition of the media giant Bennett, Coleman by transferring monies from a bank and an insurance company of which he was the Chairman. In 1955, this came to the attention of the socialist parliamentarian Feroze Gandhi who was part of the ruling Congress party headed by his estranged father-in-law Jawaharlal Nehru. In December 1955, he raised the matter in Parliament, documenting extensively the various fund transfers and intermediaries through which the acquisition had been financed. The case was investigated by the Vivian Bose Commission of Inquiry.
In the court case that followed, where he was represented by the leading British attorney Sir Dingle Mackintosh Foot, he was sentenced to two years in Tihar Jail. But for most of the jail term he managed to spend in hospital. Upon his release his son-in-law Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain to whom he had entrusted running of Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd. rebuffed his efforts to resume command of the company.
Family life.
Dalmia married six times. His first two wives, Narbada and Durga were village women, but his four later wives Pritam, Saraswati, Dinesh Nadini and Asha were all well-educated. He was separated or divorced from his third wife Pritam. His fourth wife Saraswati became his mainstay, with whom he lived most of his life.
Dalmia had eighteen children.
Death.
He died on the 26th of September 1978 at the age of 85 after a prolonged illness.

Plot.
As the morning begins, it's Saturday and Matt has joined the family for breakfast as Betty discusses meeting Matt's mother, Victoria. Hilda doesn't want to discuss being set up with Archie.
Betty meets Victoria but things do go as she expects. After a disastrous first meeting in which Mrs. Hartley mistakes Betty for hired help, Betty's determined to make a good impression at Mrs. Hartley's Friday night shindig by going through what Matt calls "The Victoria Hartley Taste Test" because of her criticism of Matt's taste in girlfriends. Through Claire's advice, Betty discovers that the topic to be discussed that night is torture, but thanks to Victoria, who succeeds by separating both Betty and Matt by placing them at the opposite ends of the dining table, the topic has been switched to the future of opera. Fortunately, Betty makes a nice save by drawing a parallel to fashion (complete with thoughts of these comparisons on the cover of "MODE") and wows the guests. 
Victoria still insists that Betty get out of Matt's life.

A stunned Betty didn't want to be labelled by Matt as his girlfriend, but apparently he does. Eventually, Betty is convinced as well, even though as she meets Matt the following day, Victoria still has a dislike for Betty after they run into each other on the street. However, Victoria has realised that she wants him to be happy, so she and Betty agree to be civil.
As Betty finds herself dealing with one love interest, sister Hilda has her own romantic dilemma to deal with, as the rest of the Suarezes, along with Elena, have conspired to invite Archie to dinner, in the hopes that he and Hilda will hit it off. It's already becoming obvious to even Archie, who sees that Hilda is resistant as she tried to avoid talking to him and tried to change the subject, that this set-up would be the lamest idea ever. Nevertheless, when he asks her to go on a date as he leaves, she accepts.
For Daniel and Wilhelmina, their attempts to lure a photographer for a photo shoot falls through after the client tells them that he wants to be paid in full by Friday or the deal is off.

So Wilhelmina must resort to selling all of her luxuries that she has grown attached over the years to an auction house in order to raise money for the magazine. She even tells Marc she is doing it to get control of the company but this move has Marc fretting the future of his boss when she must downsize by all means, including having been served almonds instead of her usual expensive snacks (champagne and caviar) and conserving energy. But the sacrifice does pay off and the client signs with MODE. As she is congratulated by Daniel, it looks like Willy hasn't given up her lifestyle as she shows Marc that she can indulge in the lavish lifestyle by showing Marc the customary snacks. 
Daniel must also deal with the latest wrinkle in his relationship with Molly after she refuses to participate in an experimental clinical study that only has up to a 10 percent success rate, and Daniel can't understand it as Molly tries to talk Daniel out of pressuring her to go through with the procedure and then insists that they still don't have a future. Eventually, he decides to accede to her wishes and pack in quality interaction in the time she has left by taking her out into the snow for a little recreation.

Stennes Revolt

The Stennes Revolt was a revolt within the Nazi Party in 1930-1931 led by Walter Stennes (1895–1989), the Berlin commandant of the SA. The revolt arose from internal tensions and conflicts within the Nazi Party of Germany, particularly between the party organization headquartered in Munich and Adolf Hitler on the one hand, and the SA and its leadership on the other hand.
Background.
The role and purpose of the SA within National Socialism was still unsettled in 1930. Hitler viewed the SA as serving strictly political purposes, a subordinate body whose function was to foster Nazi expansion and development. The SA's proper functions, in Hitler's view, were political ones such as protecting Nazi meetings from disruption by protesters, disrupting meetings of Nazi adversaries, distributing propaganda, recruiting, marching in the streets to propagandize by showing support for the Nazi cause, political campaigning, and brawling with Communists in the streets. He did not advocate the SA's functioning as a military or paramilitary organization.
Many in the SA itself—including the leadership—held a contrary, and more glorious, view of the SA's role. To them, the SA was a nascent military organization: the basis for a future citizen-army on the Napoleonic model, an army which would, ideally, absorb the Reichswehr and displace its outmoded Prussian concepts with "modern" Nazi ideals.
The 1930 elections.
The call for elections.
Reichstag elections had taken place in 1928 and the next elections were scheduled for 1932. 
Unfortunately for the course of German democracy, the Mueller government imploded in late March 1930 over the issue of the amount of employer contributions to unemployment insurance.The Reich was strained by the obligation, enacted in 1927, to pay a fixed benefit to the unemployed. In 1927 with only 1.3 million unemployed in Germany, the procedure was quite workable; however, when unemployment rose with the depression, the Reich Institution responsible for benefit payment was forced to borrow from the general government, and the debt of some 350 million Reichsmarks by the end of 1929 strained the government's budget.The SPD wanted to increase the employer contribution from 3.5 to 4.0 percent; the DVP wanted instead to cut benefits; and the Center, trying to make peace, tried to negotiate a compromise wherein all parties would defer consideration of the issue until the autumn of 1930. The SPD refused the Center's proposed deal and the Mueller government was consequently stymied.
Mueller, faced with crisis, sought President Paul von Hindenburg's help, asking for power to rule by decree pursuant to Article 48 -- a power that had been granted in 1923 to Chancellor Gustav Stresemann by President Friedrich Ebert in economic crises and that would soon be granted by Hindenburg to each of Mueller's successors as Chancellor. The haughty, aristocratic and thoroughly anti-democratic Hindenburg, having no use for any Social Democrat, refused, having decided earlier to use the opportunity to oust the SPD from its position of power in the government; he relished the chance to have formed an anti-parliamentary and anti-Marxist government. "Kershaw" p. 323-324. The result was, in accordance with Hindenburg's plan, the appointment of Heinrich Brüning, a Centrist, as Chancellor with no SPD members in his cabinet. "Ibid"; "Collier" p. 41.</ref>
Its successor, the Bruening government, was unable to obtain a parliamentary majority for its own financial reform bill, which was rejected by the Reichstag on 16 July 1930. Bruening asked Hindenburg to invoke Article 48 in order to promulgate the bill as an emergency decree. Hindenburg did so and the Reichstag promptly repudiated the bill on 18 July 1930, thereby invalidating the presidential decree under the Constitution. Bruening thereupon asked Hindenburg to dissolve parliament and call for new elections, which were scheduled for 14 September 1930.
SA demands: August 1930.
Members of the SA in Berlin, led by Stennes, had for some time been voicing objections to the policies and purposes of the SA, as those had been defined by Hitler. These SA members saw their organization as a revolutionary group, the vanguard of a national-socialist order that would overthrow the hated Republic by force.
Stennes complained that advancement within the SA was improperly based upon cronyism and favoritism rather than upon merit. He also objected to the general law-abiding approach that Adolf Hitler had adopted after the Beer Hall Putsch, and he and his men chafed under the Hitlerian order to terminate street attacks upon Communists and Jews. The SA also wanted three secure places on the NSDAP list for the upcoming Reichstag elections. In addition, he complained that the SA members under his command were not being paid sufficiently.
The SA had developed a list of seven demands. On 7 August 1930, Joseph Goebbels met with Stennes and other SA officers in Berlin. Stennes demanded the three ballot slots and threatened a "palace revolution" otherwise, claiming that he would resign and take 80% of Berlin SA (some 15,000 men) with him.
Hitler had already heard the SA demands from Franz Pfeffer von Salomon, the SA's supreme commander; had rejected Pfeffer's demands outright, had told him to "get lost" and had called him a "mutineer." Hitler ignored the Stennes initiative and did not grant Stennes an audience when Stennes came to Munich to try to meet with him. The request for the ballot slots was consistently denied.
On 27 August Stennes threatened Goebbels again: he wanted the three Reichstag seats, more money for the SA and more political power in the movement. Hitler again refused to take it seriously. Pfeffer had resigned by this time, and Hitler assured Goebbels would send the SA Chief of Staff, Otto Wagener, to fix things in the SA for Goebbels.
Stennes decided that action was needed to make a statement. Accordingly, the Berlin SA refused to provide protection for Goebbels at his Sportpalast speech on 30 August 1930, and his men paraded instead in Wittenbergplatz, demonstrating against Goebbels. Goebbels turned to the SS, who provided the necessary security and protection at the meeting and who were then assigned to protect the Gau office in Berlin.
The SA then stormed the Gau office on the Hedemannstrasse, injuring the SS men and wrecking the premises. Goebbels was shocked at the extent of the damage done and notified Hitler, who left the Wagner Festival at Bayreuth and flew immediately to Berlin.
Hitler talked to Stennes and to groups of SA the next day, urging them to follow his leadership. He redefined the issue in different and simpler terms: Was the SA entirely loyal to Hitler under the Führerprinzip, or not? Then on the following day, he convened a meeting of some 2000 SA and announced he was personally taking over as Supreme Leader of the SA and SS (thus becoming "Partei- und Oberster SA-Führer"). The SA cheered and were delighted that their Leader was finally giving them the recognition they felt they deserved. Hitler also had Stennes read a declaration increasing SA funding. A special levy (20 pfennig) would be made on party dues to pay for it.
The crisis was over for the time being. The SA members, it appeared, did not truly want to fight with Hitler or contest his leadership, but only sought treatment that they considered correct in light of their mission and the overall mission of the NSDAP. However, the band-aid applied by Hitler would not suffice to remove the underlying structural issue that conditioned the Party-SA relationship: What was the SA's role and, in particular, what would that role be if the party actually succeeded in gaining the political power it sought?
Spring of 1931.
Although he had made himself Supreme Commander of the SA, Hitler had no interest in running the SA; organization and administration bored him, and he had neither interest nor aptitude for them. His talents lay in propaganda and oratory. He summoned Ernst Röhm and offered him effective command of the SA, as its Chief of Staff. Röhm returned to Germany from his self-imposed exile in South America and promptly reorganized the SA, removing control of Silesia from Stennes.
Meanwhile, Stennes continued to complain; he noted that the SA in Breslau were not able to turn out for inspection in February 1931 because they lacked footwear. He also complained about Röhm's return to run the SA, objecting to the Chief of Staff's purported homosexuality.
Even more troubling, the strategy of taking power by force was advocated by Stennes in February articles published in "Der Angriff". This was disturbing to the Nazi leadership as it contravened Hitler's strategy of gaining power through constitutional means only and forswearing violence as a means to power. And Hitler had very publicly announced his "reliance on legality only" in the Leipzig trial of the young Reichswehr officers in September 1930, in perfect timing for the fall elections and with an eye towards the attendant propaganda value, and had sworn on the witness stand and under oath that the party had forsaken violent and illegal means as a path to power.
On 20 February 1931 Hitler issued a decree making the SA subordinate to the party organization at the Gau level. Stennes mildly protested to Röhm by letter, raising also the plight of unemployed SA men. On February 26, Röhm forbade the SA from taking part in street battles and also forbade its leaders from speaking in public.
On 28 March 1931 Brüning, employing Hindenburg's emergency powers under Article 48, issued an emergency degree requiring all political meetings to be registered and requiring all posters and political handouts to be subject to censorship. The decree also delegated wide powers to Brüning to curb "political excesses." Of course, the SA objected to the decree. Nevertheless, Hitler—whose party had recently achieved an astonishing electoral victory in the September 1930 Reichstag elections and whose "policy of legality" appeared to be paying dividends in the economic misery of the depression—ordered strict compliance. Stennes refused.
Expulsion of Stennes.
Stennes rebelled again. The SA once again stormed the party offices in Berlin on the night of March 31-April 1 and took physical control of them. In addition, the SA took over the offices of Goebbels' "Der Angriff". Pro-Stennes versions of the newspaper appeared on April 1 and 2.
Hitler instructed Goebbels to take whatever means were necessary to put down the revolt. This time, the Berlin police were called to expel the SA intruders from the party's offices.
Goebbels and Goering purged the SA in Berlin and environs. Since all money for SA was dispensed through the Gau headquarters, it was a simple matter to cut this off and the lack of funding caused the rebellion to collapse. Stennes was expelled from the party.
In an article by Hitler in the "Völkischer Beobachter" he justified Stennes' expulsion, referring to him as a "salon socialist." Hitler's editorial demanded that all SA men choose between Stennes and Hitler, declaring that the mutinous Stennes was a conspirator against National Socialism.
Hitler demonstrated his confidence in the SS by his replacement of Stennes with an SS man. Himmler later commented that "we are his favorites and have never let him down."
Stennes had following among leftist oriented SA in Berlin, Pomerania, Mecklenburg and Silesia. When he left the SA and NSDAP he founded the National Socialist Combat Movement of Germany ("Nationalsozialistische Kampfbewegung Deutschlands", NSKD) and made connection with Otto Strasser and Hermann Ehrhard, ex-leader of the defunct Viking Bund. He recruited about 2000 SA men from Berlin and elsewhere along with 2000 Ehrhardt followers, and the leaders protested that the "NSDAP has abandoned the revolutionary course of true national socialism" and will become "just another coalition party."
Aftermath and consequences.
Conservative businessmen gained more confidence in Hitler after seeing the repression of the more radical Stennes element and Hitler's attendant adherence to "legality." As Collier notes (p. 174):
Ironically the Stennes revolt may have assisted the Nazi rise to power, in that more moderate elements in the German right observed Hitler's adherence to his strategy of legality and gained confidence that he was accordingly "law-abiding." 
The revolt illustrated Hitler's consistent approach to solving intraparty frictions: resort to the Führerprinzip, rather than address the underlying problems which motivated the tension. Here, those underlying structural problems simply remained dormant for several years, and the inherent tensions between the party and the SA would only grow under the able SA leadership of Röhm, whose ambitions certainly were higher than those of Stennes. The real resolution of the Nazi dilemma would have to wait until the Reichswehr forced the issue in the summer of 1934, when, with the SA growing restless and Hindenburg on his deathbed, Hitler responded with the murderous Night of the Long Knives. The SS acquired their motto, "Meine Ehre heißt Treue", in the aftermath of the incident. Stennes himself escaped retribution. Having left Germany in 1933, he worked as a military adviser to Chiang Kai-shek until 1949, when he returned to Germany. Later it was alleged that he also served as a Soviet agent.

Seventeen (Japanese magazine)

Seventeen (セブンティーン) is a monthly Japanese fashion magazine for female teenagers published by Shueisha.
Launched in 1967 as a weekly magazine based on the original American "Seventeen", the magazine changed the name to "SEVENTEEN" in 1987, and to "Seventeen" in 2008.
Since the late 1990s, "Seventeen" has been the highest-selling teenage fashion magazine in Japan, and has featured its exclusive teenage models as "ST-Mo" (STモ - Seventeen Model). "Seventeen" is very popular among models (teenage models) because being featured on the magazine especially its certain page(s), not the cover, strongly helps them to get high-quality endorsement and collection contracts. Well-known former "Seventeen" models include Rie Miyazawa, Hinano Yoshikawa, Keiko Kitagawa, Anna Tsuchiya, Nana Eikura, and Emi Suzuki.
Controversy.
In the late 1990s, some people criticised several young female magazines, including "Seventeen", for "forcing their readers to have unhealthy lifestyles".
Seventeen kept silent about it, but in the early 2000s, Seventeen eventually started to feature some "fat" female models.
Since then, there are always some "fat models" among the Seventeen models, however, the percentage is still low. Besides, almost all of the "fat models" are actually not fat; at least under the BMI theory.
Notable current or former "fat models" include Keiko Kitagawa,and Kaela Kimura.
From 2005 to 2007, Seventeen fired all its "mixed-race" models, in this case, of Eurasian ancestry, who had modeled for the magazine and usually been considered to be overweight models. It was described as the "moggy zero movement" (or the "lard purge", "lard-free") by critical third parties, critics and some journals such as Weekly Gendai (June 4, 2007). After this, the sales of the magazine significantly began to surge.
Weekly Gendai pointed out that Seventeen's "radicality" had escalated since around 2005, because of the strong influence of the now-defunct lifestyle magazine "Burst". Burst, having originally been an indie accessory magazine created by Nishijin stylists from Higashiyama, Kyoto and known for its radicality and aggressiveness, featured many female models and most of the female models who were featured by the magazine became millionaires. Soon after the magazine stopped publication, Seventeen hired at least three former Burst editors as prominent staffs. On the editorial of Weekly Gendai (June 4, 2007), Tetsuya Miyazaki described Seventeen as the "flaming pastel-colored magazine being taken over by the ghost of Burst", and he pointed out that many "characteristic phrases" of Burst have appeared in Seventeen, especially as its headlines, since around 2005.
