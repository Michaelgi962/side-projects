Fernando de la Fuente de la Fuente

Brother Fernando de la Fuente de la Fuente (16 December 1943 – 31 October 1996) was a Spanish Marist Brother and missionary who was one of four Marist Brothers martyred at the Nyamirangwe refugee camp, Zaire. Together with the brothers of his community who were assassinated, Brother Miguel Ángel Isla Lucio, Brother Servando Mayor García, and Brother Julio Rodríguez Jorge. Brother Fernando is commemorated in Marist circles as one of " The Martyrs of Bugobe".
Early life and works.
Born to Sigismundo and Primitiva de la Fuente de la Fuente in Burgos, Spain, he became a teacher in Chile after taking his first vows on 2 July 1962. He had also worked as a formator and a member of the Chilean Provincial council.
Life in Zaire.
The Marist Brothers had had a strong presence in east-central Africa, particularly Rwanda, where they had been 1952. However, with the Rwandan genocide in 1994, in August 1994, the General Assembly and the District Council of the Brothers of Rwanda took the decision to have a renewed presence among the Rwandans to assist in the nation's rebuilding. Within the country, three communities which centred their mission on the schools were reopened. Six Brothers formed a new community at the service of the refugees outside the country. In view of the escalating difficulties faced by the refugees and the Rwandan Brothers themselves, the community was reinforced with three non-African Brothers. But as the inter-racial tensions persisted, it was decided to withdraw the Rwandan Brothers from the Bugobe community.
To aid the mission of the Rwandan Brothers, Brother Fernando offered to participate as an expression of missionary solidarity. He was accepted and left in December 1995 to serve the mission. After two months in Belgium, at the Centre for the Formation of French-speaking Missionaries, he went to Zaire, to the refugee camp of Nyamirangwe (Bugobe), in February 1996. 
Assassination.
The brothers were assassinated on 31 October 1996 around eight o'clock in the evening. They were apparently shot. The perpetrators of the crime were a group of the Officers of the Rwandan Patriotic Army (APR), who murdered the Archbishop Christophe Munzihirwa two days before and the Rwandan and Burundian refugees in the refugee camp Nyamirangwe. The four bodies were recovered from the waste-water tank on 14 November and have been interred at the brothers' novitiate house in Nyangezi.

The Electoral Atlas of New South Wales

The Atlas.
Although NSW has been mapped since the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788 there is no existing atlas that gives an opportunity to explore the development of responsible government since its inception in NSW in 1856. Therefore, the purpose of this Atlas is to enable citizens, students and scholars the opportunity to compare the development of political aspirations and discern social movements over the last 150 years with maps of each of the 21 redistributions and 53 elections held in that time.
There are many ways to tell the story of responsible government in New South Wales. The approach taken in this publication, the Electoral Atlas of New South Wales, is to tell the story through the history of the State's electoral boundaries, electoral systems and election results. The Atlas illuminates 150 years of Responsible Government by examining the historical and political geography of the State and illustrates our changing political State and demonstrates the linkages between traditional politics, social movements and historical events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. An easy to follow format, consistent map presentation and the use of simple colouring schemes will allow the casual reader to quickly understand the ebbs and flows of the State's politics since 1856.

Atlas Introduction - Broadening the Franchise.
The first two elections in 1856 and 1858 were contested under the franchise arrangements that had applied for the old Legislative Council. The right of electoral enrolment was granted to any person holding freehold property to the value of £100, leasehold property to the annual value of £10, possessing a pastoral licence, having a salary of £100 per year, paying board or lodgings to the value of £40 per year, or just lodging to £10 per year. Potential electors had to have met these requirements for six months prior to their name being placed on the electoral roll. Rolls were compiled once a year by an officer appointed by the local Magistrate’s Court. Special hearings were held after each compilation at which objections to a name appearing or being rejected from the roll could be lodged.
The 1856 Census allows analysis of the proportion of the population entitled to vote, and published roll data also specifies the qualification under which electors were granted their right to appear on the roll.
The 1858 Electoral Act made residency the sole qualifying criterion, the vote being extended to all males aged 21 and over who were resident natural-born or naturalised British subjects. However, the six months residency requirement remained, which disenfranchised may people in itinerant occupations. The property qualifications remained for non-resident voters, allowing plural voting for those who held property in several seats. The property vote probably explains the high rate of enrolment in Sydney districts at the table of 1856 data. As late as 1891, more than one in ten names on the roll in inner Sydney districts qualified on the basis of the property vote.
The 1858 Act also introduced two special categories of electorates. Three Gold Fields electorates were defined as covering declared gold fields within specified general electorates. Rolls were not kept for Gold Fields seats, voters being able to establish their right to vote by presenting either a mining licence or business licence in a proclaimed gold field that had been held for at least six months. Voters could also appear on the roll for general districts, but were prevented from voting in both their resident general district and the overlaying Gold Fields district.
The second special seat was the University of Sydney, which would become entitled to a seat once there were 100 graduates resident in the colony. The University Senate petitioned for the seat to be created in 1876. The first election was a by-election on 8 September 1876, William Charles Windeyer defeating the youthful Edmund Barton 49 votes to 43. Registrar Hugh Kennedy advised:
As it appears that there is no legal necessity for members of the University who take part in the Election of a Representative to appear in academic costume, they will not be required to do so; but they are requested, if they conveniently can, to comply with the customary practice on such occasions.
Oddly, the next day the notice had been amended to say academic costume was “required”.
The 1880 Electoral Act redrew the State’s electoral boundaries to account for the changing distribution of population. The enrolment provisions of the 1858 Act were retained, though the Gold Fields and University of Sydney districts were abolished..
The most significant change to enrolment procedures took place with the 1893 Parliamentary Electorates and Elections Act. For the first time residence was made the sole basis for establishing a right to vote. Plural voting was abolished by ending the property vote, electors being only entitled to enrol in the district in which they resided. The required period of residence was also reduced to three months. The existing rolls were abandoned under the new Act. Entirely new rolls were prepared for the 1894 election, which probably explains the significant spike in turnout to 80% at the 1894 election, the highest rate until the introduction of compulsory voting. The period of residence was further reduced to one month in 1896, voters also being allowed to vote in their old districts in the interim.
Certain classes of voters such as police and the military were denied the right to vote, though these restrictions were removed in the following decade. Following the lead of other states, women were granted the vote for the 1904 election, though women were not allowed to run for Parliament until 1920. Aborigines were not denied the right to vote, but always struggled to meet the residency requirements. The adoption of the joint roll arrangements with the Commonwealth in the 1920s effectively removed the right of Aborigines to vote until the 1960s.
The 1893 Act had adopted a Voter’s Right document that a voter presented to be checked off the roll before a ballot paper was issued. In 1900, the compilation of annual rolls was made a function of the local police and Elector’s Rights were abolished in 1906. Rolling rolls rather than annual reviews were adopted in 1920.
Compulsory enrolment was adopted in 1920 and compulsory voting for the 1930 election. The only significant change to enrolment laws since has been the extension of the vote to 18 year-olds in 1973. In both World Wars, special provisions were introduced to allow service personal to retain their electoral rights. The vote was also extended to service personal under the legal voting age.
Atlas Introduction - The Changing Electoral System.
The first election was conducted under first past the post voting in districts returning between one and four Members. Voters had as many votes as there were vacancies to be filled. Like minded candidates in multi-Member districts would arrange a “bunch”, advocating a vote for a ticket of candidates. This voting method was retained for both the 1858 and 1880 Electoral Acts.
However, the 1880 Act included a provision to deal with future population growth by allowing districts to be allocated extra Members as population increased, up to a maximum of four Members. The size of the Parliament increased from 108 MLAs in 1880 to 141 in 1891, with an increase in multi-Member districts. The Act failed to provide for the loss of seats in districts with declining population. Along with other inadequacies in the electoral system, this led to the reforms of 1893.
The 1893 Parliamentary Electorates and Elections Act divided the state into 125 single Member electoral districts, with Members elected by simple majority or first past the post voting. Following Federation, the size of the Parliament was reduced to 90 seats in 1904. The form of the ballot paper was changed in 1906 and the confusing method of crossing out the names of candidates not supported was replaced by the Commonwealth procedure of marking the boxes for preferred candidates.
With three Parties in the field in the 1890s, informal electoral pacts were adopted to cope with first past the post voting. In the period where Labor supported Reid’s Free Trade Government, the two Parties avoided contesting seats held by the other. The demise of the Progressives after 1904 reduced politics to a two-party system, though many former Progressive MLAs remained in the Assembly as independent liberals. Other organisations such as the Temperance Alliance and the Farmers’ and Settlers’ Association chose to issue lists of preferred candidates in this period. The problem of competing conservative candidates dividing the non-Labor vote was dealt with by several experiments with the electoral system between 1910 and 1930.
The first was the introduction of second ballots at the 1910 election. If the first ballot failed to produce a candidate with more than 50% of the vote, a second ballot was conducted one to three weeks later between the two leading candidates. This overcame the problem of competing anti-Labor candidates, but in practice revealed other problems. There were 26 second ballots between 1910 and 1920, and in 20 cases, the turnout increased at the second ballot. At the 1913 election, the increased turnout at the second ballot appeared largely responsible for Labor winning seats where Labor’s vote had trailed the combined vote of non-Labor candidates on the first ballot.
In this period, there were several attempts to establish a new Progressive Party. The split in the Labor Party over conscription resulted in the Liberal Party, Progressive and pro-conscription Labor MLAs coalescing into a new Nationalist Party. In the post-war period, the pressure for a separate Progressive Party was revived. The new party was in favour of proportional representation, the system introduced and used at the three elections in 1920, 1922 and 1925. Ballots were now to be marked with numbered preferences rather than ticks and crosses, mimicking the new Federal preferential system. The counting method adopted was similar to the Tasmanian Hare-Clark system, or the modern Senate system. The main difference was that candidates were listed in alphabetic order, not grouped by party. At the first election in 1920, preferences were compulsory, producing an informal vote of 9.7%. It was as high as 16% in Botany where voters were required to indicate 19 preferences. Preferences were made voluntary beyond the number of Members to be elected ahead of the 1922 election, reducing the informal vote to 3.6% in 1922 and 3.3% in 1925.
Proportional representation proved unpopular with many Members. The parties were also unhappy with the finely divided Parliaments the system produced. Declining population in the west of the State required the boundaries to be re-drawn and the opportunity was taken to revert to single-Member districts for the 1927 election. By this stage the parties had stabilised into the system that remains today, a single Labor Party opposed by two Parties, one rural based and the second predominantly urban based.
The 1927 election was fought on single Member districts, but using optional preferential voting, a provision imposed on the Lang Government by the Legislative Council. The Bavin Coalition Government that followed introduced compulsory preferential voting for the 1930 election. This system remained in place until changes to the Constitution in 1980 re-introduced optional preferential voting. Both single-Member districts and optional preferential voting are now entrenched in the State’s Constitution and a referendum is required to change them.

Battle of Gabon

The Battle of Gabon or the Battle of Libreville was part of the fighting in French West Africa that occurred in November 1940 as part of World War II. The battle resulted in the Free French Forces under General Charles de Gaulle taking Libreville, Gabon, and taking all of French Equatorial Africa from Vichy French forces.
Background.
On 8 October 1940, General de Gaulle arrived in Douala. On 12 October, he authorised plans for the invasion of French Equatorial Africa. De Gaulle also wanted to use French Equatorial Africa as a base to launch attacks into Axis-controlled Libya. For this reason, he personally headed northward to survey the situation in Chad, located on the southern border of Libya.
On 27 October, Free French forces crossed into French Equatorial Africa and took the town of Mitzic. On 5 November, the Vichy garrison at Lambaréné capitulated. Meanwhile, the main Free French forces under General Philippe Leclerc and Battalion Chief Marie Pierre Koenig departed from Douala, French Cameroon. Their goal was to take Libreville, French Equatorial Africa.
Battle.
On 8 November 1940, depth charges from the damaged the Vichy "Redoutable"-class submarine , which was then scuttled off Port-Gentil. Koenig's forces landed at Pointe La Mondah. His forces included French Legionnaires (including the 13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade), Senegalese, and Cameroonian troops.
On 9 November, Westland Lysander aircraft operating out of Douala bombed Libreville aerodrome. The aerodrome was eventually captured, despite stiff resistance met by Koenig's force in its approach. Free French naval forces, including the attacked and sank her sister ship, the Vichy French .
On 12 November, the final Vichy forces capitulated at Port Gentil. Governor Masson — despairing of his actions — committed suicide.
Aftermath.
On 15 November, de Gaulle's personal appeal failed to persuade most of the captured Vichy soldiers — including General Marcel Tetu — to join the Free French. As a result, they were interned as prisoners of war in Brazzaville, French Congo for the duration of the war.

Thermophysics

Thermophysics in general is the geological application of thermal physics which is related to the classical physics study of thermal science.
Remote Sensing.
Earth thermophysics is a branch of geophysics that uses the naturally occurring surface temperature as a function of the cyclical variation in solar radiation to charactertize planetary material properties.
Thermophysical properties are characteristics that control the diurnal, seasonal, or climatic surface and subsurface temperature variations (or thermal curves) of a material. The most important thermophysical property is thermal inertia, which controls the amplitude of the thermal curve and albedo (or reflectivity), which controls the average temperature. 
This field of observations and computer modeling was first applied to Mars due to the ideal atmospheric pressure for characterizing granular materials based upon temperature and Glaser, 1965. The Mariner 6, Mariner 7, and Mariner 9 spacecraft carried thermal infrared radiometers et al., 1971; Kieffer et al., 1973, and a global map of thermal inertia was produced from modeled surface temperatures et al., 1977 collected by the Infrared Thermal Mapper Instruments (IRTM) on-board the Viking 1 and 2 Orbiters.
The original thermophysical models were based upon the studies of lunar temperature variations by Wesselink and Jaeger [1953. Further development of the models for Mars included surface-atmosphere energy transfer 1966, atmospheric back-radiation et al., 1971, surface emissivity variations et al., 1973, CO2 frost and blocky surfaces et al., 1977, variability of atmospheric back-radiation and Jakosky, 1991, effects of a radiative-convective atmosphere et al., 1995, and single-point temperature observations et al., 2000; Mellon et al., 2000.

Light curtain

Light curtains are opto-electronic devices that are used to safeguard personnel in the vicinity of moving machinery with the potential to cause harm such as (but not limited to) presses, winders and palletisers. Light curtains can be used as an alternative to mechanical barriers and other forms of traditional machine guarding. By reducing the need for physical guards and barriers, light curtains can increase the maintainability of the equipment they are guarding. The operability and efficiency of machinery can also be improved by the use of light curtains by, for example, allowing easier access for semi-automatic procedures.
Description.
Light curtains fall into a category of equipment known as presence detection devices. Other common presence detection devices are pressure-sensitive safety mats and laser scanners (often used on Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) when in industrial settings). Most important application of safety relays is in automation industries dealing with robotic cell set up.
Light curtains are supplied as a pair with a transmitter and receiver. The transmitter projects an array of parallel infrared light beams to the receiver which consists of a number of photoelectric cells. When an object breaks one or more of the beams a stop signal is sent to the guarded equipment.
The light beams emitted from the transmitter are sequenced, one after the other, and pulsed at a specific frequency. The receiver is designed to only accept the specific pulse and frequency from its dedicated transmitter. This enables the rejection of spurious infrared light and thus enhances their suitability as components within a safety system.
Typically, light curtains are connected to a safety relay which will remove motive power from the hazard in the event that an object is detected. Safety relays can be provided with muting functionality which enables the temporary disabling of the safety function to allow objects to pass through the light curtains without tripping the safety relay. This is particularly useful for machinery which has some semi-automatic procedures.
Standards.
The following partial list of standards should be used for guidance when implementing light curtains:

Chinese cruiser Yangwei

Yangwei () was a cruiser in the late Qing Dynasty Beiyang Fleet. Its sister ship was the . The Imperial Japanese Navy warship was built to the same designs.
Background.
The design for "Yangwei" was advertised by its designer British naval architect Sir George Wightwick Rendel at the Armstrong Whitworth shipyards at Newcastle upon Tyne in England as an example of a low-cost cruiser able to withstand larger Ironclad warships. In theory, the ship would rely on its small size and higher speed, along with a higher muzzle velocity main battery to attack larger, more cumbersome foes – very similar to the principles of Jeune Ecole, as promoted by French naval architect Emile Bertin. However, the British Admiralty was very skeptical of the idea, and had concerns over the seaworthiness of the design in the North Sea, and did not order any of the design for the Royal Navy. Armstrong Whitworth turned to overseas clients instead; however, rapid technological advances in ship design and naval artillery (with the advent of large calibre quick-firing guns) rendered the design with its weak armor and small guns obsolete within a few years.
Design.
"Yangwei" had an all-steel construction with waterproof bulkheads, a single smokestack, and twin masts, which could also be used for sails. The prow was reinforced for ramming. The power plant was a double expansion reciprocating steam engine with four cylindrical boilers driving twin screws. The ship had a number of technical innovations, including a hydraulic steering system and electrical incandescent light fixtures. The ship’s main armament were breech-loading 10-inch Armstrong Whitworth cannons, one on the bow and one on the stern, mounted in stationary gun shields. The ship also had four 5.1-inch guns, (two to each side), two 57-mm long guns, four 11 mm Gatling guns, four 37 mm Hotchkiss guns, two 4-barreled Nordenfeldt guns, as well as two torpedo tubes.
Service record.
"Yangwei" was laid down on 25 January 1880, launched on 29 January 1881, completed on 15 July 1881, and sailed back to Weihaiwei on 22 November 1881 together with her sister ship, "Chaoyong". The cost for both ships was 65 million taels of silver. Construction was rushed, due to strained relations between China and Russian Empire over the Ili River in Central Asia. On arrival, "Chaoyong" and "Yangwei" were both assigned to the Beiyang Fleet. As relations between China and the Empire of Japan became increasing strained over Korea, both vessels were dispatched to Incheon in a show of force. In 1886, both vessels were part of the fleet let by Admiral Ding Ruchang, calling on Hong Kong, the Japanese port of Nagasaki, Korean ports of Busan and Wonsan, and the Russian naval base of Vladivostok. However, due to poor maintenance, by 1890, "Yangwei" could achieve a maximum speed of only 10 knots, and many of her weapons were not operational.
These issues were not addressed by the time of the First Sino-Japanese War, and despite the state of the vessel, Admiral Ding placed "Yangwei" in the line of battle during the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September 1894. She was attacked by the Japanese flying squadron consisting of the cruisers , , , and , which fired high explosive shells from their quick-firing 6-inch and 4.7-inch guns. Guns from "Matsushima" scored a number of direct hits. Within a few minutes, fires broke out on "Yangwei", which quickly engulfed the central superstructure with its numerous wooden partitions covered with thick layers of flammable varnish. Her steering disabled, she collided with in the battle and sank in shallow water. Some of her crew survived by clinging to her masts, which remained above water.

Tanya Garcia

Tanya Katherine Rosales Lyttle, more popularly known by her screen name Tanya Garcia (born August 5, 1981), is a Filipina telenovela and film actress. She became a household name after playing Cecilia in one of the longest running soap operas of GMA Network, "Sana Ay Ikaw Na Nga", opposite Dingdong Dantes.
Career.
Her showbiz career started when she was introduced as one of the teen stars of "Star Circle Batch 5" on ABS-CBN. She appeared in youth-oriented shows like "Gimik" (where she was first paired with Patrick Garcia) and played supporting role in "Esperanza" as Judy Ann Santos’ sister.
She took a break from her showbiz career for a while and concentrated on her studies. She took up mass communication at Dominican College when she was signed by Viva Films and later on appeared in the Viva Television afternoon drama "Anna Karenina" as Grace opposite Dingdong Dantes. She also had a cameo role in the TV Drama "Ikaw Lang Ang Mamahalin."
Her rise to fame started when she played the role of Cecilia in the drama telebabad show "Sana Ay Ikaw Na Nga" with Dingdong Dantes, Bobby Andrews and Angelu de Leon. On the later part of the soap, she also played the role of Olga, the antagonist of Cecilia, which was played again by Maricar de Mesa.
After her stint at that show, she was reunited with onscreen partner Dingdong Dantes at the light dramedy "Twin Hearts" as Althea, a heart operation survivor who fell in love with the ex-boyfriend of the heart donor. She was also paired with Dennis Trillo.
She did a religious-theme show in QTV called "Noel" where she was paired with James Blanco and Paolo Contis. She was then later on paired with Ogie Alcasid in the family-oriented TV show "Ay Robot" again with QTV.
She also appeared in "Agos", the third season of "Now and Forever", in which she played Sophia, a young liberated lawyer who eventually falls in love with her brother (played by Dennis Trillo). She also had a cameo role in the show "Makita ka Lang Muli" as the young Celia Rodriguez.
She is considered as one of the sexiest Pinay in the Philippine Showbiz scene. She first appeared in the March 2006 issue of FHM Philippines.
Tanya Garcia also starred in numerous movies. She played the role of a possessed man’s wife in "Kulimlim" with Robin Padilla as her leading man in 2004. Some of her movie credits include "Shake, Rattle and Roll 2k5", "Filipinas" and "Batas Militar".
After her long hiatus on the telebabad run, she’s back as the wicked stepmother Aloya in the new GMA Fantasy show "Super Twins" topbilled by Jennylyn Mercado, Nadine Samonte and former loveteam Dennis Trillo.

Li Xian (prince)

Li Xian (李賢) (653–684), courtesy name Mingyun (明允), formally Crown Prince Zhanghuai (章懷太子), named Li De (李德) from 672 to 674, was a crown prince of the Chinese Tang Dynasty. He was the sixth son of Emperor Gaozong, and the second son of his second wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian). He was known for writing commentaries for the "Book of Later Han", the official history of the Eastern Han Dynasty. He became crown prince in 675 after his older brother Li Hong's death (which traditional historians believed to be a poisoning by Empress Wu), but soon fell out of favor with Empress Wu himself. In 680, Empress Wu had her associates accuse Li Xian of treason, and he was demoted to commoner rank and exiled. In 684, after Emperor Gaozong's death, Empress Wu, then empress dowager, had her associate Qiu Shenji (丘神勣) visit Li Xian to force him to commit suicide.
In 706, his younger brother Emperor Zhongzong provided Li Xian with an honorable burial by interring his remains at the Qianling Mausoleum.
Background.
Li Xian was born in 653, as the sixth son of Emperor Gaozong and the second son of his then-favorite concubine Consort Wu (later known as Wu Zetian). There were, however, persistent rumors inside the palace that he was not actually born of Consort Wu but of her older sister Wu Shun (who was later created the Lady of Han). In 655, the same year that his mother Consort Wu displaced Emperor Gaozong's first wife Empress Wang as empress, Li Xian was created the Prince of Lu. In 656, he was initially titularly given the post of prefect of Qi Prefecture (岐州, roughly modern Baoji, Shaanxi), and then the dual posts as prefect of the capital prefecture Yong Prefecture (雍州, roughly modern Xi'an, Shaanxi) and commandant at You Prefecture (幽州, roughly modern Beijing). It was said that his behavior was elegant, even in his youth, and, according to a comment that Emperor Gaozong made to the chancellor Li Ji, he studied the "Classic of History", "Classic of Rites", "Analects", and a number of ancient poems and could remember them clearly. In 661, his title was changed to Prince of Pei, and he was given the titles of commandant at Yang Prefecture (揚州, roughly modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and major general, but continued to also serve as prefect of Yong Prefecture. At this time, he had the literarily talented official Wang Bo on staff. Around this time, the princes were apparently often engaged in cockfighting. Wang Bo wrote a playful piece entitled the "Declaration Against the Prince of Zhou's Cock" (檄周王雞文) (the Prince of Zhou was Li Xian's brother Li Xiǎn (note different tone), later named Li Zhe), which, however, when Emperor Gaozong read it, caused Emperor Gaozong to be angry, as he believed this would cause discord between his sons, and therefore expelled Wang from the Pei mansion. In 672, Li Xian's title was changed to Prince of Yong, and he was given the titles of commandant at Liang Prefecture (涼州, roughly modern Wuwei, Gansu), but continued to also serve as general and prefect of Yong Prefecture. His name was also changed to Li De. In 674, his name was changed back to Li Xian.
As crown prince.
In 675, Li Xian's older brother Li Hong the crown prince died -- a death that traditional historians generally believed to be a poisoning ordered by Empress Wu. On July 3, Li Xian was created crown prince to replace Li Hong. Emperor Gaozong soon ordered that much of government matters be ruled on by Li Xian, and Li Xian was praised for making good decisions. Also around this time, Li Xian led a group of scholars, including Zhang Da'an, Liu Nayan (劉訥言), Ge Xiyuan (格希元), Xu Shuya (許叔牙), Cheng Xuanyi (成玄一), Shi Cangzhu (史藏諸), and Zhou Baoning (周寶寧), in writing commentaries for the "Book of Later Han", the official history of the Eastern Han Dynasty, written by the Liu Song scholar Fan Ye.
Meanwhile, Li Xian's relationship with Empress Wu began to deteriorate, as Li Xian had heard the rumors that he was actually the son of Lady of Han, and had become fearful. Empress Wu, detecting this, had her literary staff write two works entitled, "Good Examples for Shaoyang" (少陽正範, "Shaoyang" being an oblique term for a crown prince) and "Biographies of Filial Sons" (孝子傳) and gave them to Li Xian, and further wrote a number of letters rebuking Li Xian, making him more fearful. Further, when the sorcerer Ming Chongyan (明崇儼), who was well-trusted by Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu, was assassinated in 679, Empress Wu suspected Li Xian -- as Ming had been known to repeatedly make comments to Empress Wu that included, "The Crown Prince cannot bear the responsibilities of state. The Prince of Ying [(i.e., Li Xian's younger brother Li Zhe, later Emperor Zhongzong] has an appearance most similar to Emperor Taizong (Gaozong's father)," and "The Prince of Xiang [(i.e., Li Xian's younger brother Li Dan, later Emperor Ruizong)] has the most honorable appearance."
Meanwhile, Li Xian was also known for his liking of music and women. (Some historians, pointing to oblique references that he was "particularly close" to a number of male servants, also believe that he liked sexual relations with both women and men.) When Empress Wu heard this, she had people report this to Emperor Gaozong, who ordered an investigation led by the officials Xue Yuanchao, Pei Yan, and Gao Zhizhou. When they searched the crown prince's stables, they found several hundred suits of black armor, and they believed this to be evidence of a coup, and after interrogation, one of Li Xian's favorite servants, Zhao Daosheng (趙道生), admitted to assassinating Ming on Li Xian's orders. Emperor Gaozong, who had favored Li Xian, considered pardoning him, but Empress Wu refused. On September 20, 680, Emperor Gaozong deposed Li Xian and reduced him to commoner rank, delivering him from the eastern capital Luoyang (where Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu had long taken up residence) to the capital Chang'an to be imprisoned there. His close associates were executed, and the seized armor was burned publicly to demonstrate Li Xian's treason. Li Zhe was created crown prince to replace him.
After removal.
in 683, Li Xian was moved from Chang'an to Ba Prefecture (巴州, roughly modern Bazhong, Sichuan). In 684, after Emperor Gaozong's death, Li Zhe initially took the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong), but soon was deposed himself due to signs of disobedience to Empress Wu (now empress dowager), and Li Dan became emperor instead (as Emperor Ruizong), although Empress Dowager Wu retained all powers as regent. In spring 684, she sent the general Qiu Shenji to Ba Prefecture with the order of, "Examine the house of Li Xian the former crown prince to prevent external attacks." However, she hinted to him that he should have Li Xian killed. When he got to Ba Prefecture, he placed Li Xian into a small room and forced him to commit suicide. When news of Li Xian's death arrived at Luoyang, Empress Wu publicly blamed Qiu and demoted him to the post of prefect of Die Prefecture (疊州, roughly modern Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu), while publicly morning Li Xian and posthumously creating him the title of Prince of Yong. (Qiu was soon recalled to Luoyang to again be general.) After Empress Wu's death in 705 and the restoration of Emperor Zhongzong to the throne, Emperor Zhongzong had Li Xian's casket returned to Chang'an, to be buried near the tomb of Emperor Gaozong. After Emperor Ruizong became emperor again in 710, he had Li Xian's crown prince title restored.

Bradley Willman

Bradley Willman (born 1980) is an anti-pedophile activist from Canada who engaged in private investigations using the Internet to expose pedophiles. At one time, he had unfettered access to between 2,000 and 3,000 computers that had been used to visit websites of interest to pedophiles as the result of his use of a Trojan horse. Willman's actions helped put California Superior Court judge Ronald Kline in prison for more than two years in 2007 for possession of child pornography. However, the legality of Willman's use of the Trojan horse was a basis for appeal by the judge.
Biography.
Early life.
Willman was born in 1980 in Langley, British Columbia, Canada.
Private eye.
Willman identifies himself as a "private computer cop" and previously used the aliases "Garbie" and "Omnipotent." In the late 1990s, Willman began tracking and investigating people who downloaded child porn from the Internet. At some time before 2000, Willman devised a Trojan horse, a type of computer program, that he used to conduct his investigations.
The Trojan horse was posted to websites of interest to pedophiles in a way that it appeared to be a picture-file attached to a message, but was actually a program file. When a visitor to the pedophile website downloaded the file, the visitor unwittingly downloaded the Trojan horse, and would typically be unaware that it was running on his or her computer. Willman had no control over who chose to download the Trojan horse. Once it had been downloaded, Willman could access, search, and retrieve files from the infected computer. Willman stated "My whole intent, after the program started working as I expected it to, was to help kids." Willman estimated that his Trojan Horse gave him access to between 2,000 and 3,000 computers that had been used to visit websites of interest to pedophiles, including those of police officers, military personnel, social workers, priests, and judges.
Pre-Kline investigations.
In March 2000, Willman helped the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with a child molestation case. Some time after August 2000, Willman anonymously provided to a private watchdog group documents related to a Kentucky state investigation of child molestation and production of child pornography. Prior to January 2001, the United States Customs Service contacted Willman to see whether he had discovered any useful information related to a suspected Russian child pornography ring.
"United States v. Kline".
In early May 2000, California Superior Court Judge Ronald C. Kline (1941–) downloaded the Trojan horse to his computer. The Trojan Horse allowed Willman, who was in B.C., to monitor the contents of Kline's computer in California. Between May 2000 and mid-April 2001, Willman copied from Kline's computer portions of Kline's diary.
In April 2001, Willman anonymously forwarded excerpts of a diary on Kline's hard drives with a final entry dated March 18, 2001 to the website of pedophile-watchdog PedoWatch. PedoWatch passed the diary on to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Office, which forwarded it to the California Attorney General's office, which in turn sent it on to the City of Irvine Police Department.
The search.
In November 2001, Irvine police searched Kline's Irvine home and found more than 1,500 pornographic computer images of young children on the judge's home computer. Child porn also was found on Kline's courthouse computer. This event drew national attention and ultimately led Kline to drop his bid for reelection as judge, largely as a result of efforts by talk radio hosts John and Ken of KFI-AM (640).
After Kline was charged in November 2001 by the United States Federal Government with possession of child pornography, a man who said the judge had molested him when he was a 14 years old a quarter-century earlier came forward and California state child molestation charges were filed against Kline as well. The state child molestation charges were dismissed in July 2003 after the legal case "Stogner v. California," held that a California extension of the statute of limitations for sex-related child abuse could not be applied to previously time-barred prosecutions.
Legal proceedings.
In the United States, evidence that derives from an illegal "government" search generally cannot be used in court against a defendant by the government. However, evidence that derives from an illegal "private" search such as from a citizen tipster may be used in court by the government, even though the search was illegal. When an individual does the illegal search, a court answers the private/government search question by determining whether the individual was an "instrument or agent" of the government. If "the government knew of and acquiesced in the intrusive conduct, and ... the party performing the search intended to assist law enforcement efforts," then the party performing the illegal search is considered an agent of the government.
On March 17, 2003, a federal judge ruled that Willman was working as a government informant when he invaded Judge Kline's computers because (i) Willman thought of himself as an agent for law enforcement and (ii) Willman's motivation for the invasion was to act for law enforcement purposes. Since the judge ruled that this violated Kline's United States 4th Amendment right to privacy against illegal searches by the government, the judge suppressed some of the prosecution's strongest evidence against Kline. Specifically, the judge suppressed all evidence seized from Kline's home and his home computer, including excerpts from a computer diary about his sexual desires and more than 1,500 pornographic photos of young boys.
On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the appeals court disagreed with the federal judge and found that it was not enough for Willman to act with the intent to assist the government. There needed to have been some degree of governmental knowledge and acquiescence in Willman's actions to find that Willman was acting as a government agent. Thus, the appeals court reversed the district court's order suppressing the evidence that was found as the fruit of Willman's illegal, but private, search. In March 2005, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the case, which ended Kline's appeals.
The admission.
With the 9th Circuit and United States Supreme Court actions, Willman's evidence was now back in play. In December 2005, former Orange County Superior Court Judge Ronald C. Kline pleaded guilty to possessing child pornography on his home computer, ending a four-year legal battle during which Kline was under house arrest. A trial conviction could have brought Kline a 30-year prison term, but a plea agreement limited prison time to a possible 27 to 33 months.
In June 2006, the state Commission on Judicial Performance gave Kline the most serious punishment it could give a former judge by barring him from receiving work from state courts.
In February 2007, Kline was sentenced to 27 months in prison for possessing child pornography.

Whoop-Dee-Doo!

Whoop-Dee-Doo! is a deliberately ramshackle musical revue subtitled "a postage stamp extravaganza". It was conceived, created and developed by Charles Catanese, Howard Crabtree, Dick Gallagher, Phillip George, Peter Morris and Mark Waldrop. Songs and sketches by Dick Gallagher, Peter Morris and Mark Waldrop. Additional material by Brad Ellis, Jack Feldman, David Rambo, Bruce Sussman and Eric Schorr.
A co-production of The Glines and Postage Stamp Xtravaganzas it opened at Actors Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, New York City, June 16, 1993, and closed February 20, 1994, after a run of 271 performances. Director: Phillip George. Musical Director: Fred Barton. Set Design: Bill Wood, Costume Design: Howard Crabtree, Lighting Design: Tracy Dedtrickson. Cast: Howard Crabtree, Keith Cromwell, Tommy Femia, David Lowenstein, Peter Morris, Jay Rogers, Ron Skobel, Richard Stegman and Alan Tulin. Executive Producers: Charles Catanese, John Glines, Michael Wantuck.
The songs and sketches are based around extravagant costumes designed by Howard Crabtree. Despite the exuberantly camp style, the songs belie their surface silliness and the show's apparent amateurishness, and often have a serious point: "Born This Way" is a rousing song about the nature vs. nurture debate of the origins of homosexuality, "Last One Picked" looks at gay schooldays, and "A Soldier's Musical" makes points about gays in the military.
"Whoop-Dee-Doo!" won 1994 Drama Desk Awards in two categories: Best Musical Revue and Outstanding Costume Design (Howard Crabtree). In 1995 RCA Victor made a "Nearly Original Cast Recording".
In 1994 the Kings Head Theatre in London staged a production of the show, with Christopher Biggins taking Jay Rogers' role as the lead cast member always complaining about the quality of the production, and drag performer Earl Grey taking Tommy Femia's role as Judy Garland and other gay icons in the number "You Are My Idol". Other cast members included Ashley Knight, Ray C. Davis and Michael Gyngell.

Nurech.b

Nurech.B is a computer worm that infects computers through MSN Messenger. It inserts a link in the chat window while you are chatting with someone, thus making it look as if your friend sent it and thus exploiting that trust. Once you click on that link, it downloads an .exe file with a name such a "Valentine Card" or "Happy Valentine's Day". Once infected, it spreads through your MSN to your friends and is invisible.
Effects.
The virus disables virus scanners and access to the folders containing any antivirus software. It adds keys to the registry as well, and therefore you won't be allowed to access the registry either. You cannot get rid of it from the registry using registry cleaning software because it has a rootkit function that allows it to hide its key in the registry and also its processes thus making it virtually invisible. Many people head to Google to search for an antivirus software but any search for terms such as virus, spyware, malware etc. closes the browser.

Japanese snapper

Paracaesio caerulea, the Japanese snapper, is a species of snapper native to the Western Pacific Ocean where it is known to occur in the waters around southern Japan, Taiwan and the Chesterfield Islands of New Caledonia. It is found in areas with rocky substrates at depths of over . This species can reach a length of TL though most are around . It is important commercially as a food fish.
Culinary use.
Japanese snapper, known in sushi restaurants as "Tai," is the authentic species of Red Snapper served in traditional Japanese restaurants. 
The common fare of "Red Snapper" in typical Sushi restaurants throughout the USA is actually a variety of Tilapia, known as "Izumi Dai" in Japanese. Not only are the tastes and textures of each form of fish significantly different, they also dwell in completely different aquatic environments, Tilapia being a fresh water fish and Japanese snapper inhabiting the Pacific Ocean.

F.I.N.E.*

"F.I.N.E." is a song by the American hard rock band Aerosmith. It was written by lead singer Steven Tyler and lead guitarist Joe Perry. The song title is an acronym for "Fucked Up, Insecure, Neurotic, and Emotional", as stated in the album's liner notes. The song, totaling four minutes, nine seconds, is the second track on the band's 1989 album "Pump". It was released as a promotional single to rock radio in 1989, and reached #14 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.
Song information.
"F.I.N.E." is a more upbeat hard rocking song, similar to "Young Lust" both lyrically and musically. The song's lyrics are very raunchy and focus on youth angst and lasciviousness, and the verses feature the line "I'm ready" after each line, suggesting sexual arousal, or being "ready" for sex. Many tongue-in-cheek lyrics are prevalent throughout the song including "she's got the Cracker Jack, now all I want's the prize", "I got the right key baby, but the wrong keyhole", "I shove my tongue right between your cheeks", etc. The chorus features a repeating of the word "Alright", followed by a person who thinks the narrator is alright, including "your daddy", "your mama", "my old lady", "my little sister", "my brother", "even Tipper" (a reference to Tipper Gore who headed the P.M.R.C. censorship campaign during this time), and "Joe Perry" (a reference to Aerosmith's lead guitarist).
The only mentions of the term "F.I.N.E." are in the line "my brand new baby looks so F-I-N-E fine" and in a bridge towards the end of the song, where Tyler sings "everything about you is so F-I-N-E fine". Later on in the "Pump" album, in the song "What It Takes", there's a line that goes "girl, before I met you I was F-I-N-E fine". "F.I.N.E." was one of the potential album titles brainstormed for the album which eventually became "Pump", but Geffen A&R man John Kalodner insisted he wouldn't have an album called "FINE". If one looks closely on the trucks on the front cover of the album, the word FINE can be seen on the side of them.
Meaning of acronym.
In the album liner notes, F.I.N.E. is said to stand for "Fucked up, Insecure, Neurotic and Emotional."
This may have an association to the rehabilitation programs such as A.A. and N.A.. Many such programs use this phrase to describe the feeling of your life being out of control.
The acronym is also discussed in the movies "The Italian Job" and "Scream 2".
Liv Tyler also references this as a nod to her father at the end of the movie "Super" starring Rainn Wilson. During her scene with the rehabilitation group session she is heard stating "fucked up, insecure, neurotic, and emotional."
In other media.
The song is featured in Walt Disney World's Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith in the coaster car with the license plate "BUHBYE".
F.I.N.E. was the name of a classic rock band from Portland, ME

Phallic Rock also commonly known as Cock Rock is a precambrian granite rock formation in Carefree, Arizona, United States. The formation is caused by spheroidal weathering whereby the composition of the granite and its crystal structure facilitated the development of rounded corners and its unique tubular shape. The formation is at the eastern foot of Black Mountain and can be found approximately 400 feet east of Tom Darlington Drive on Stagecoach Pass Road. The formation is best viewed from the western side looking east. There is a dirt pull-off on the side of Stagecoach Pass Road with enough room for several vehicles.

Photoelectric sensor

A photoelectric sensor, or photo eye, is a device used to detect the distance, absence, or presence of an object by using a light transmitter, often infrared, and a photoelectric receiver. They are used extensively in industrial manufacturing. There are three different functional types: opposed (through beam), retro-reflective, and proximity-sensing (diffused).
Types.
A self-contained photoelectric sensor contains the optics, along with the electronics. It requires only a power source. The sensor performs its own modulation, demodulation, amplification, and output switching. Some self-contained sensors provide such options as built-in control timers or counters. Because of technological progress, self-contained photoelectric sensors have become increasingly smaller.
Remote photoelectric sensors used for remote sensing contain only the optical components of a sensor. The circuitry for power input, amplification, and output switching are located elsewhere, typically in a control panel. This allows the sensor, itself, to be very small. Also, the controls for the sensor are more accessible, since they may be bigger.
When space is restricted or the environment too hostile even for remote sensors, fiber optics may be used. Fiber optics are passive mechanical sensing components. They may be used with either remote or self-contained sensors. They have no electrical circuitry and no moving parts, and can safely pipe light into and out of hostile environments.
Sensing modes.
An opposed (through beam) arrangement consists of a receiver located within the line-of-sight of the transmitter. In this mode, an object is detected when the light beam is blocked from getting to the receiver from the transmitter. 
A retroreflective arrangement places the transmitter and receiver at the same location and uses a reflector to bounce the light beam back from the transmitter to the receiver. An object is sensed when the beam is interrupted and fails to reach the receiver. 
A proximity-sensing (diffused) arrangement is one in which the transmitted radiation must reflect off the object in order to reach the receiver. In this mode, an object is detected when the receiver sees the transmitted source rather than when it fails to see it.
Some photo eyes have two different operational types, light operate and dark operate. Light operate photo eyes become operational when the receiver "receives" the transmitter signal. Dark operate photo eyes become operational when the receiver "does not receive" the transmitter signal.
The detecting range of a photoelectric sensor is its "field of view", or the maximum distance the sensor can retrieve information from, minus the minimum distance. A minimum detectable object is the smallest object the sensor can detect. More accurate sensors can often have minimum detectable objects of minuscule size.

A Woman Killed with Kindness

A" Woman Killed with Kindness" is an early seventeenth-century stage play, a tragedy written by Thomas Heywood. Acted in 1603 and first published in 1607, the play has generally been considered Heywood's masterpiece, and has received the most critical attention among Heywood's works. Along with the anonymous "Arden of Faversham," Heywood's play has been regarded as the apex of Renaissance drama's achievement in the sub-genre of bourgeois or domestic tragedy.
The play was originally performed by Worcester's Men, the company for which Heywood acted and wrote in the early Jacobean era. The records of Philip Henslowe show that Heywood was paid £6 for the play in February and March 1603. The 1607 quarto was printed by William Jaggard for the bookseller John Hodgets. A second quarto was issued in 1617 by William Jaggard's son Isaac Jaggard.
The plot of Heywood's play derives from an Italian novel by Illicini, which was translated into English and published in "The Palace of Pleasure" by William Painter (1566).
The play tells the story of a married couple, Master Frankford and his wife Anne. Frankford invites Wendoll into his home to act as a companion. Frankford tells Wendoll that anything in his house is at Wendoll's disposal. Wendoll then chooses to pursue Frankford's wife, Anne. Anne is quickly wooed by Wendoll and then caught by Frankford. Frankford then chooses to punish her not with death but with ostracism—a "mild" sentence for her adultery. By the end of the play, Anne chooses self-starvation as a more appropriate form of punishment. As she is dying because of her self-starvation, Frankford reunites with his wife, which restores the social and patriarchal order at the end of the play.
The adulterous wife, Anne Frankford, is contrasted with the virtuous Susan Mountford. In the play's subplot, Sir Charles Mountford attempts to prostitute his sister Susan to Sir Francis Acton (Anne Frankford's brother), to whom he is deeply in debt. Susan, however, retains her virtue. In the end Acton discharges the debts of Mountford and marries Susan.
Early Modern Elizabethan and Jacobean views of fasting or self-starvation were often hearkened to old Medieval views which considered a woman's fasting a visual cue to a woman's obedience, chastity, and honour. Eating, binging, or gluttony were considered to be fundamentally connected with sexuality. According to several Early Modern conduct book writers, the sin of gluttony will inevitabily lead to lust, and several of these tract writers suggested female fasting should be a part of a woman's education as it would prove her to be a better wife and mother.

Utah Olympic Park

The Utah Olympic Park is a winter sports park built for the 2002 Winter Olympics, and is located east of Salt Lake City near Park City, Utah, United States. During the 2002 games the park hosted the bobsleigh, skeleton, luge, ski jumping, and Nordic combined events. It still serves a training center for Olympic and development level athletes. Other facilities in addition to the ski jumps and bobsled track located on site include a 2002 Winter Olympics and Ski Museum, day lodge, summer aerial training splash pool, ziplines, and a mountain coaster.
Park History.
Like the Utah Olympic Oval and Soldier Hollow, the park was designed and built specifically for the Olympic games, under the supervision of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC). The 1989 Olympic referendum, which was passed by Utahns, allowed for tax payer money to fund a winter sports park, which would be used if Salt Lake City won its bid for either the 1998 or 2002 Winter Olympics; Olympic funds and revenue would then be used to repay the state. In 1990 the Utah Sports Authority announced their plans to build the park, which included ski jumps and a bobsled-luge track, in Bear Hollow near Park City. Before construction on the park began, it faced criticism from local landowners and citizens of Summit County, concerned over traffic and environmental effects. Construction got underway following a groundbreaking ceremony on May 29, 1991. The original estimated cost of the park was $26.3 million and included the ski jumps, bobsled-luge track, and a day lodge, all to be completed by September 1992. The majority of the park was designed and engineered by Eckhoff, Watson and Preator Engineering and its joint venture partner, Van Boerum & Frank Associates, all of Salt Lake City.
After Salt Lake City lost its bid to host the 1998 Winter Olympics in 1991, the Utah Sports Authority gained permission from the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) to slowdown construction on the park, extending its planned opening date. Four of the park's ski jumps (18, 38, 65 and 90 meters) were completed and opened on December 12, 1992, and were formally dedicated in a ceremony on January 9, 1993. On July 31, 1993 the summer training facilities at the park, which included a ski jumping pool, were dedicated. The park's day lodge, located near the base of the jumps, was completed in late summer 1993.
A groundbreaking ceremony on June 3, 1994 signaled the start of construction on the bobsled-luge track. The track was completed December 28, 1996 and its grand opening ceremony was held on January 25, 1997. The very first run on the new track was by luger Jon Owen on January 10, 1997. Following the completion of the track it was decided to reintroduce skeleton as an Olympic event during the 2002 Winter Olympics and plans called to use the track to host all three sliding events.
While construction was progressing on the track, Salt Lake City won its 1995 bid to host the 2002 Winter Olympics, and plans were developed to expand the park. On October 9, 1997 SLOC okayed the plan to spend an additional $48 million to upgrade and expand the recently completed park. The plans called for replacing and moving the existing 90-meter ski jump, and building a brand new 120-meter jump. Also the construction of starting houses on the track, chairlifts, storage buildings, new access roads, pedestrian bridges, parking lots, and sewer and water lines were all part of the expansion plan. The transform of the park began during the Summer of 1998, with the majority of expansion work completed by fall 2000. Ownership of the park was transferred from the Utah Sports Authority to SLOC on July 14, 1999. Soon after, in Spring 2000, the name "Utah Winter Sports Park" became the "Utah Olympic Park'.
The park today.
The park still serves a training center for Olympic and development level athletes, as well as a recreational highlight in the state. Other facilities in addition to the Nordic jumps and bobsled track located at the park include a 2002 Winter Olympics Museum and Ski Museum in the Joe Quinney Winter Sports Center, a day lodge, summer aerial training jumps and splash pool, ziplines, and a mountain coaster.
Joe Quinney Winter Sports Center.
Located within the Utah Olympic Park is the Joe Quinney Winter Sports Center. The center stands next to the day lodge and summer splash pool.
History.
For many years the Alf Engen Ski Foundation had desired to construct a museum to honor legendary skier Alf Engen, and display his winter sports collection. It was decided to do this inside a future building at the park, also named for a skier, Joe Quinney. A site dedication ceremony for the privately funded Joe Quinney Winter Sports Center was held August 28, 1999, while construction didn't begin until after the actual groundbreaking on March 28, 2000. Following the building's completion, it was temporarily turned over to SLOC during a ceremony on September 18, 2001. During the games the center would be used by Olympic officials, members of the world media and athletes, then after the games, the building would be turned back over to the foundation. The cost of just the vacant building was $10 million, the majority of which was privately funded, but SLOC did contribute a percentage of construction costs so the building could be used during the games. The completed building was in size with three stories, and its concrete exterior was covered with Plexiglas (various figures and designs were etched into the Plexiglas).
Following the Olympics the building was turned into a ski and Olympic museum at a cost of $2.5 million more, for a total of $12.5 million. The Alf Engen Ski Museum opened in a soft opening on May 20, 2002, with exhibits designed by Academy Studios. The grand opening ceremony for the center was held July 5, 2002, and the building included the Engen Ski Museum, a gift shop, café and a temporary Olympic photo exhibit (which would be replaced by a new Olympic museum in later years). 
On September 27, 2002, two life-sized statues of Alf Engen and Joe Quinney were unveiled in the Olympic plaza near the building. In May 2004 the Alf Engen Ski Foundation sold the center to the Utah Athletic Foundation, who owns and operates the surrounding Utah Olympic Park. In early June 2005 the temporary 2002 Olympic Photo Exhibit was replaced with a new permanent Olympic museum. An opening celebration for the officially titled "George Eccles Salt Lake 2002 Olympic Winter Games Museum" was held June 9, 2005.
Exhibits.
The center houses two museums, the Alf Engen Ski Museum and the George Eccles Salt Lake 2002 Olympic Winter Games Museum. The Ski Museum contains more than 300 trophies, medals, uniforms, scrapbooks, skis, boots, photos, films and other collectibles that span some 70 years in the career of the Engen family. It also highlights Utah's rich ski history and the Wasatch Range, along with efforts made by the U.S. Forest Service to help develop Utah's ski resorts, and an exhibit on Utah's winter weather.
The 2002 Winter Olympic Museum, currently located on the second floor of the center, includes athletic equipment used during the games, Olympic medals (and a display on how they were created), costumes and puppets used during the ceremonies, many of the officially licensed pins produced for the games, a photo op at an Olympic torch mounted in front of a large photo of the cauldron, along with video clips and other memorabilia.

Seducing Mr. Perfect

Seducing Mr. Perfect (Mr. 로빈 꼬시기), alternatively known as "Seducing Mr. Robin", is a South Korean film, released on December 7, 2006. It was written and directed by Sang-woo Kim and stars Uhm Jung-hwa as Min Joon and Daniel Henney as Robin Heiden.
Plot summary.
Min-june (Uhm Jung-hwa) is a believer in true love and always very dedicated to her current boyfriend. However, men always break up with her - her latest boyfriend ends their relationship on his birthday. Distracted by the latest break-up, she bumps into a car and a man steps out of it - who turns out to be her new boss, Robin Heiden (Daniel Henney). Heiden has very clear ideas about a relationship and love: both are a game of power and Min-june seeks advice from him, as she doesn't want to get dumped again. However, when she starts to treat men like Heiden treats women, she realizes that she prefers her older behavior, even if that means that she gets dumped again; she doesn't see love as a game of power and never will. Heiden, who has to deal with his own heartbreak, as he loved a woman so much that she had to shoot him to get the message across that she wasn't interested in him, starts to soften at Min-june's attitude towards life. He eventually falls in love with her and both get into a real relationship and a happy ending of their own.
One of the unique concepts of the movie is that Robin Heiden speaks only English because he finds Korean hard to speak, while Min-june speaks mostly in Korean. The two seem to understand each other perfectly without any outside translation. This was a new style of dialogue for Korean films, and it is partially credited for the film's success.

James V Wigley

James Vandeleur Wigley (1918–1999) is an Australian painter known for his sensitive depictions of aboriginal camp scenes and desert landscapes. 
Wigley studied at the School of Fine Arts in North Adelaide with F. Millward Grey. During 1939 he spent time with his old school friend, the anthropologist, Ronald Berndt, at Murray Bridge, where he completed a series of portrait drawings of local people. He moved to Melbourne in 1941 where he joined an army survey regiment, then a unit making relief maps and model aeroplanes used to train officers. Wigley exhibited in the 1942 Anti-Fascist exhibition held in Melbourne where he became friends with Noel Counihan and other social realist painters and writers. After his discharge from the army in 1943 he travelled to the Northern Territory to join Ronald Berndt at Daly River. During this time he completed a number of drawings of outback camp life.
Following his return to Melbourne and two years of art study at the National Gallery School in an army rehabilitation course, Wigley travelled to Europe with fellow artist Yosl Bergner. He exhibited in Paris, at the Galerie Gentil Hommiere, and in London, before returning to Melbourne in 1953.
In 1956 Wigley went to Port Hedland in the North West to work with Donald McLeod and the Aborigines of the region in an Aboriginal workers' co-operative, living independently by mining and pearl shell gathering. During 1974 the group purchased a sheep station in the Pilbara and established an independent school. In developing this school, Wigley worked the offset press to print all material needed for a multi-lingual school, and illustrated and designed the readers' books.
In 1979 Wigley returned to Melbourne to paint and draw. In 1991 he returned to the Northern Territory for a short period, where his son, Julian, was working with Aboriginal communities. A survey of his work was held at the Niagara Galleries in 1992. He continued to paint until his death in 1999.

2ZG

2ZG was a radio station in Gisborne originally owned by the Radio New Zealand commercial operation. The station was first started as 2XG in 1948 broadcasting on 1010AM. In the 1960s the call sign and brand name were changed to 2ZG and the station moved to 1060AM. In 1978 after New Zealand changed its AM frequency spacing from 10 kHz to 9 kHz 2ZG moved to 945AM. 
2ZG was known as The Coaster during the 1980s and in the 1990s as Gisbornes 2ZG. In 1996 Radio New Zealand sold their commercial operation and as a result 2ZG was now owned by The Radio Network. In 1998 2ZG became part of the Community Radio Network with all content outside breakfast now being fed from Taupo. In 1999 2ZG began broadcasting on 90.9FM and as a result the station was renamed to ZGFM. In early 2001 the original 945AM frequency was reassigned to Newstalk ZB and at the end of 2001 all Community Radio Network stations became part of the Classic Hits network, as a result ZGFM became known as Classic Hits 90.9 ZGFM with all programming outside of breakfast now fed from the Classic Hits studio in Auckland. 
Today the station is known as Classic Hits 90.9 and the local breakfast show is hosted by Joel Palmer.

<doc id="9767071" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9767071" title="Lulama Xingwana">
Lulama Xingwana

Lulama "Lulu" Marytheresa Xingwana (born 23 September 1955) is a South African politician who served as Minister for Women, Children and People with Disabilities from November 2010 - May 2014. Previously she held the position of Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy from 2004 to 2006 and was Minister of Agriculture and Land Affairs from 2006 to 2009, succeeding Thoko Didiza.
Education.
Xingwana obtained a Bachelor of Science degree from University of Witwatersrand in 1985 and three postgraduate diplomas, one in Economic Principles from the University of Limpopo in 2002, and the other two in Development and Leadership Studies, and Rural Development from the University of Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe.
Political career.
Xingwana became a Member of Parliament after the 1994 South African elections. She is currently also chairperson of the Southern African Development Community's Regional Women's Caucus and director of the South African Council of Churches' Women's Development Programmes (1987). She has chaired the Joint Monitoring Committee for the Improvement of Quality of Life and Status of Women (2002–2004), the Parliamentary Women's Caucus (1999–2004), the Malibongwe Rural Development Project for Women (1998–2000) and the National Assembly Portfolio Committee for Sports and Recreation (1994–1999). She has been a tutor of Classes for Domestic Workers in rural areas and the suburbs of Johannesburg, as well as for Learn and Teach, since 1985. From 1999 to 2004, she was on the National Assembly Portfolio Committee for Defence. She has also been on the ANC's Provincial Executive Council for Gauteng (1998–2001) and the National Assembly Portfolio Committee: Environmental Affairs and Tourism (1996–2004), Head of Development for the ANC Women's League (1991–1994) and a member of FEDSWA (1981–1991). Her membership to the United Democratic Front lasted from 1983 until 1991, and she has been a member of the ANC Women's League since 1993.
Controversy.
In her appointment as Agriculture and Land Affairs Minister, Xingwana caused controversy in 2007 when she accused white farmers of being cruel and inhumane towards their workers. She claimed that farmers regularly "rape and assault" their workers. These statements enraged many farmers, and two farm unions, AgriSA and the Transvaal Agricultural Union, challenged her to provide evidence that would support her accusations. The minister called for a meeting with the unions, but the farmers walked out in protest. Former President Thabo Mbeki was called in to resolve the dispute.
Executive toilet.
In April 2009, a report in the Afrikaans newspaper "Rapport" repeated details found by one of its readers in a three-page Land Affairs document of a special mobile toilet, imported at R500,000, for Xingwana's exclusive use while handing over land in various parts of the country. Its specifications were said to include gold trimmings, but Xingwana's spokesperson denied the claim, declaring that, although Xingwana did indeed have a specially-reserved toilet, it was no different from those which played host to the "hoi polloi".
Homophobic remarks.
In March 2010 Lulu Xingwana stormed out of an art exhibition that she was attending in her capacity of minister of Arts and Culture, calling the work 'immoral'. It was alleged by an anonymous insider that Xingwana had objected to the display of same-sex couples, but the official reason provided through her spokesperson was that it was “It was immoral, offensive and going against nation-building.”.
Designer furniture procurement.
In early February 2013 it was reported that Xingwana spend R2.1 million on refurnishing the department of Women, Children and People with Disabilities head office with new designer furniture. Nearly half of that amount was spent custom made furniture for her own office. Xingwana was accused by opposition parties of using public resources to indulge in her own "extravagant taste in furniture and overseas trips" instead of defending the rights of vulnerable South Africans, which her department is responsible for.
Afrikaner-domestic violence remarks.
On the 26th February 2013 Xingwana stated on the Australian news channel ABC News: “Young Afrikaner men are brought up in the Calvinist religion believing that they own a woman, they own a child, they own everything and therefore they can take that life because they own it.”
After making the remarks she was accused by the Afrikaans civil rights organisation Afri-Forum of discriminating "on the basis of race, faith and gender,” and that this was "an extreme verbal attack on the integrity of Afrikaners." The Christian Democratic Party called for the president to fire her. The Afrikanerbond stated that her comments where an "extreme verbal attack on the integrity of Afrikaners" and speculated that she made the statement in an attempt to divert attention away from report detailing mismanagement within her department.

Moon Whistle

It won an ASCII-held monthly contest, Internet Contest Park, two popular votes on Internet Contest Park, reaching respectively #1 and #8, and an honorable mention in the ASCII Entertainment Software Contest.
Overview.
"Moon Whistle" is a story-based role-playing game, featuring sprite characters and objects, 2D exploring maps, cutscene dialogues, and combats ― conventional fares of old-school role-playing games as a whole. The game's prominent feature is its setting; contrary to a regular save-the-world plot in a high fantasy setting, the story of "Moon Whistle" unfolds mostly in a fictionalized modern Japanese city completed with original chip sets and character sprites. Much like the "Mother" series, most of main characters are preteen children. Their wielding weapons are everyday items and toys, they wear casual clothing or mascot costumes instead of a piece of armor, and monsters they fight include weird ones like burner/tripod monsters and iron frogs. The entire music was composed for the game by the pseudonym Hyōseki Saia (氷石彩亜).
Basically its story revolves around a kindergarten-aged boy, Zenon (ぜのん), and his friends, while it also focuses on topics like alienation mainly from the viewpoint of another lead character, X Ranger (Xレンジャー). Zenon generally does not speak lines but with a few exceptions. The whole story is divided into over 20 small episodes, every of which takes place in a day. Once the player is finished with a day, the next day featured continues.
Gameplay.
While unique in appearances, its gameplay is a customary one for a role-playing game; buying items in shops, equipping gadgets, random encounters, boss battles, leveling up, explorations, communicating with townspeople, and so forth. Its battle system is the default one of RPG Tsukūru 95 so that battles are operated in a front-view, turn-based fashion that resembles to that of SNES "Dragon Quest" games.
Plot.
Set in Motomachi Town (もとまちタウン), a fictional 1980s Japanese suburb, the story begins on Zenon's first school day following spring vacation. After school, he goes to a hill in the town together with Narumi looking for X Ranger, a superhero in a children’s TV show, who allegedly appears in Motomachi Town for some reason. After meeting a man in X Ranger's costume, Zenon and Narumi fight a bad monster in the hill in hope of helping him. Thanks to this, Zenon becomes popular enough with school-age children to be invited to their "secret base" to join them.
Later Zenon and the gang happen to visit X Ranger's hiding place, and touch the panel of a giant machine sitting in there without his consent. Then they find themselves in a strange town, where they save Tsēta (ツェータ) from Haruto (ハルト), a spoiled mean child, and are befriended with him. Once prohibited to use the machine by X Ranger, later they are allowed to go between two cities. A cat-like creature, Makkusu (マックス), is also acquainted with them.
After some events, Tsēta notices that Zenon's town is very similar to his, Motomachi City (もとまちシティ), and questions X Ranger on it. He reveals that he is a 19-year-old Zenon, who came from the future (Motomachi City) to his past (Motomachi Town) by a time machine in order to recover hopes and dreams of people. Eidosu (エイドス), a Priest of Time (時の神官), later confronts X Ranger claiming that X Ranger's action causes the timeline to shift, as well as Makkusu, who, being also a Priest of Time, helped X Ranger complete a time machine.
In autumn, a new toy Rocket Monster (ロケットモンスター) has become a fad among kids in Motomachi City. However, suddenly one of them goes berserk, and it results in severe criticism to the product by parents. Zenon and his friends find out that it was plotted by Haruto's father, who intended to damage the profits of his rival firm by harming repute of their product, Rocket Monster. In consequence, Rocket Monster has succeeded in recovering its status.
After the next year began, people in Motomachi City suddenly all got melancholic. Zenon and his friends investigate the case, and fight with X Ranger's shadow. After the battle, X Ranger realizes that this world is not real and he in reality is presumably unconscious for an attempted suicide. Also, this world of the dream was shared by the Haruto in reality. He acquires in his dream immense power, and challenges Zenon and Tsēta again, only to be defeated. Out of grudge, he destroys Sphere (スフィア), enshrined in the Shrine of Time (時の神殿), which maintains the order of worlds, while the master of the Shrine, Boratiru (ボラティル), restores it in exchange for his life. Despite this, still Sphere was split in two.
Since Sphere was broken, Zenon was no longer able to access to the future. X Ranger decides to return to his reality, and together with Zenon, visits the Shrine of Time to challenge the Final Trial, in which X Ranger faces his surrounding problems. At the end of the Trial, Boratiru's spirit awaits to kill Zenon so as to extinguish the world of the dream. With the help of X Ranger, however, Zenon and the gang defeat Boratiru. After this, X Ranger and Makkusu return to each place. In March, Zenon and Narumi attend the graduation ceremony of their kindergarten.
Off-shoots.
As a spin-off of "Moon Whistle", was released in April 2003, which, at that time, was developed by the use of RPG Tsukūru 2000.

Low (computability)

In computability theory, a Turing degree ["X"] is low if the Turing jump ["X"′] is 0′, which is the least possible degree in terms of Turing reducibility for the jump of a set. Since every set is computable from its jump, any low set is computable in 0′. A set is low if it has low degree.
More generally, a set "X" is generalized low if it satisfies "X"′ ≡T "X" + 0′.

Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510 (1968), was a U.S. Supreme Court case where the court ruled that a state statute providing the state unlimited challenge for cause of jurors who might have any objection to the death penalty gave too much bias in favor of the prosecution.
The Court said, 
The decision in this case would cause the Supreme Court of California to order a retrial on the penalty phase in the 1972 case of "California v. Anderson", and when the case was heard for the third time, would find the imposition of the death penalty was unconstitutional on the grounds of the penalty being cruel or unusual punishment, in violation of the State Constitution. The decision would become national in scale when the U.S. Supreme Court also in 1972 ruled in "Furman v. Georgia" that all death penalty cases were in violation of the 8th Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.

Edmund Anscombe

Edmund Anscombe (8 February 1874—9 October 1948) was one of the most important figures to shape the architectural and urban fabric of New Zealand. He was important, not only because of the prolific nature of his practice and the quality of his work, but also because of the range and the scale of his built and speculative projects. These extended from conventional essays to monumental urban schemes informed by his international travel, especially in America. His influence was specifically felt in Dunedin, Wellington and Hastings, yet he also realised projects in Alexandra, Invercargill, Palmerston, Palmerston North, Rotorua, Waimate North and Wanaka. His key works include the 1925-26 NZ and South Seas International Exhibition, the 1940 New Zealand Centennial Exhibition, the Herd Street Post and Telegraph building, Anscombe Flats, the Empire Deluxe theatre and his work on the clocktower complex - including specifically the Archway Building and Marama Hall - effectively re-conceiving the design of the University of Otago's historical core.(University of Otago Clocktower complex)
Biographical background.
Anscombe was born on 8 February 1874 in Lindfield, Sussex, England. His parents Edmund and Eliza Anscombe (née Mason) emigrated on 27 June 1874 to New Zealand on the "Christian McAusland" in the assisted immigration scheme. They arrived in Dunedin with seven month old Edmund and his two year old sister Eliza. His father is described as a carpenter aged 25 years old from Sussex. His mother was 28. They arrived in Otago, New Zealand on 30 September 1874. His sister Edith Violet was born in Dunedin on 1 April 1885.
Edmund attended Caversham School (from 1879–1885) and in 1888, as a 14 year old boy, he left New Zealand on what, in most accounts, is seen to be a prophetic visit to the 1888 Melbourne exhibition. In his own words:
"From then onwards anything pertaining to Exhibitions held for me its own decided and never ending interest." (Anscombe "Inside Story")
This lifelong interest in the design of exhibition buildings was furthered by: his attendance at the 1889-90 New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition in Dunedin, involvement in the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, St Louis (1904), his appointment as architect to the New Zealand and South Seas International Exhibition Company (1924–25), attendance at the Chicago World's Fair (1933) and the New York World's Fair (1939), and his appointment as the architect of the New Zealand Centennial Exhibition (1940). Whether the exhibition was the primary reason for his visit to Melbourne cannot be known for certain, but on his return Anscombe became an apprentice carpenter in Waiwera South, Otago, and worked for his father as a builder. This experience perhaps influenced his later architectural work which he approached with an entrepreneurial pragmatism. He married Douglas Watt in 1898 after which they lived with Edmund's parents. His first child, Ruby, was born 1899. In 1911 his second daughter, Marjory, was born.
In 1901 Anscombe travelled to America. This 1901-1906 trip is the most written about of his travels. He visited St Louis Purchase Exposition where he "received ... practical training in exhibitions in 1904" and it is during this time that he is said to have studied architecture, an idea first asserted in an obituary but something Anscombe himself does not refer to.
Architectural practice in Dunedin.
On their return to Dunedin, the Anscombes enrolled Ruby at High St School (24 July 1907). Described as "an architect now resident in Dunedin, who has had considerable experience in the United States," Anscombe won the University of Otago School of Mines competition in 1907 under the pseudonym: "Esperanto." This winning entry began his productive relationship with the university council which in 1911 conferred on him the position of university architect - a position he retained until 1928 when he left Dunedin for Wellington. This position gave him access to commissions across the university including: extensions to Maxwell Bury's work, Allen Hall (1914), the Domestic Science building (1918), the Physics building (1922), Marama Hall (1923), the Dental school (1924), and the Medical school (1927). Anscombe's early and consistent success in competitions (which included: the School of Mines (1907), Hanover St Baptist Church, Dunedin (1912), Y.M.C.A. (1910), Central Hall (1910), and Otago Girls' High School (1910 and 1921 ) - where he won first and second place ) coincided with a number of ecclesiastical commissions: St. Clair Presbyterian Church (1909), Oamaru Presbyterian Church (1910), Musselburgh Presbyterian Church (c1910), Mornington Baptist Church (1910/11), North East Valley Presbyterian Church additions (c. 1913), Opoho Presbyterian Church (1913), and residential design work for: Mr. Ivory (c.1909), Thomas Fogg (c.1910), Rev. James Chisholm (c1910), H. C. Campbell (1911), H. S. Bingham (1913), Thomas Thomson (c.1914).
These early years in Anscombe's practice were also early years in the history of the New Zealand Institute of Architects (N.Z.I.A), which began as a national organisation in 1905. Anscombe was elected a Fellow of the N.Z.I.A. in 1912. He also contributed an article entitled: "The Economic Value of Scientific Town Planning" to an N.Z.I.A. conference. About 1916, Anscombe began experimenting with a concrete block dry wall system. It was at this time he designed "Cintra," his house in Andersons Bay, Dunedin, which was constructed in these "O.K. blocks" which he patented in 1920. Shortly after this Anscombe's mother died at the age of 66 years on 2 July 1921.
Anscombe's practice continued to flourish and commissions from this time included the Maheno and Marama Hospital Ships' Surplus Fund Memorial Hall (1919/1923), the Lindo Ferguson Building (1927), the University of Otago Dental School (1924), Arthur Barnett's Department Store (1924), now part of the Meridian Mall, Dunedin, Messers Herbert, Haynes and Co Ltd building (1925), Logan Park Grandstand (1929) and, of course, the design work for the New Zealand and South Seas International Exhibition (1925–26), including the still surviving art exhibition building (1924), which involved a number of overseas trips specifically to Melbourne to consult with the engineer of the scenic railways in Melbourne.
Anscombe was utterly proactive in finding work and both the New Zealand and South Seas International Exhibition (1925) and the New Zealand Centennial Exhibition (1940) were initiated by him but it seems this proactive approach may have alienated him from some sectors of the architectural profession. The first signs of this appear at the time an architect was to be appointed for the 1925 exhibition and is documented in an exchange of letters between Anscombe and the N.Z.I.A. regarding this subject. The N.Z.I.A. had offered to donate
"a Lay-out Scheme on any Site ... act in an Honorary Advisory capacity in approving and if necessary suggesting improvements to any design."
Later they advocated that the design work be apportioned to individual architects. Anscombe queried the N.Z.I.A. offer of a "donated" plan which, it seems, fast became conditional on the assurance of further work and he described this as "decidedly infra dig and a breach of etiquette on the part of ... the Institute much to be regretted." He made clear his opposition to the dividing of architectural responsibility, arguing that in his opinion it was not in the best interests of the Directors. In a later N.Z.I.A. meeting he was accused of "competing against the Institute for the work" and was asked to "retire from the Meeting." A similar situation occurred later with reference to the 1940 exhibition when Anscombe found himself opposed by the collective group of local architects. In that instance, it was Anscombe's ability to produce work quickly which ensured he got the commission.
Travels 1928-1929.
In 1928, after leaving Dunedin, Anscombe embarked on a longer world trip accompanied by his two daughters now aged 29 and 17 years. They left for this trip in early March 1928 and travelled to the Middle East (Egypt, Greece, Palestine, and Turkey), Britain (England, and Ireland), and Europe (Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland) concluding the journey in America before returning to New Zealand via Honolulu and Suva. The "Dominion" reports the group's recent return in April 1929. On this trip, Anscombe seemed particularly interested in architecture, city and street planning, and the use of lighting at night time. While they were abroad Anscombe's father died on 8 August 1928 at Ashburton at the Tuarangi Home for old men.
The trip bridges Anscombe's practice in Dunedin and his practice in Wellington. There are various speculations as to why Anscombe, a well established architect in his mid-fifties, made the move to Wellington at this time. Shaw attributes Anscombe's move to the need "to be ready to design the Centennial of New Zealand Exhibition of 1939-40," while McNeill notes the timing of Anscombe's departure coincides with the publication of The Inside Story which "would have made it difficult for him to remain in Dunedin."
Architectural practice in Wellington.
In Wellington Anscombe set up a practice on The Terrace and he and his daughters lived on Oriental Parade at the back of the section Anscombe was later to build Lyndfield (now Anscombe Flats). They lived there until the apartment block was completed in the late thirties. These apartments, like many projects during the inter-war depression, were built on the "No. 13" scheme where a percentage of the project's cost was met by Government funding. The Anscombes occupied the penthouse flat at Lyndfield, which, when his daughters married and left home, became a place of regular extended family gatherings. The flat was also where Anscombe trialled drafts of his schemes, letters, and proposals in front of his architect sons-in-law, daughters and grandchildren for discussion and feedback.
Anscombe employed a small office in Wellington which designed a range of work including residential apartments (Lyndfield and Olympus on Oriental Parade, Franconia on The Terrace (1938), Belvedere at the corner Austin and Majoribanks Streets), Hamilton Flats (Hawker Street) and commercial and institutional projects including: the Post and Telegraph Building, Herd St (1939), Dominion Motors, the Island Bay kindergarten, and the Lloyd St, Disabled Soldiers' Vocational Centre (1943). His work in the Hawke's Bay area included offices and a wool store for the New Zealand Shipping Co. Ltd at Port Ahuriri, Washpool Homestead, the Farmers Co-operative Association Building, Westerman & Co (1932), and the State Theatre (1933–34) with Vernon Brown in Hastings. One of his longest serving staff in this Wellington office was Mrs. Ethel Bulté, who was known as "Auntie Pat" by Anscombe's grandchildren. She was Anscombe's secretary and is remembered by the grandchildren as always wearing black, her "grey hair pulled back into a bun" with the appearance of being an "efficient secretary." She remained a friend of the family even after Anscombe died.
Once established in Wellington, and after the extension of his office into the Hawke's Bay following the 1931 earthquake, Anscombe travelled to the United States again visiting the Chicago World's Fair for three weeks in July 1933. On this same trip he visited Long Beach, California where he was ""very impressed with the beautiful waterfront feature enclosing an area of of still water."" This influenced his 1945 proposal for a bandshell and amenities on a wide promenade wall to enclose of still water with an illuminated fountain at Oriental Bay, published in "The Evening Post" in February 1945. Such schemes were sometimes extensions of building projects as in the case of the Post and Telegraph Building in Herd St which shaped a proposed gardens in Chaffers Park part of a plan, which was realised, to extend Cable St as "a new approach to Oriental Bay." Anscombe also contributed to the discussion of the shaping of the Civic Centre, publishing a scheme in "The Dominion" in June 1934.
In early May 1940, Anscombe anticipated travel to America and wrote to the Minister of Supply, Dan Sullivan, that he was
"anxious to visit the United States shortly - primarily to visit both the San Francisco and New York Worlds Fairs - but while there I intend to check up on the latest development in Combined Factories, Housing, City Planning Schemes generally, Air Port Schemes, Bus Termini Stations etc." (unpublished letter to D.G. Sullivan, Minister of Supply, May 1940)
He offered to report on these to the Minister on his return. Sullivan replied asking Anscombe to "particularly look at the latest developments in that country with a view to translating them into a concrete proposal for this country." On this trip Anscombe visited: the Douglas aircraft works, Santa Monica, the Curtis Wright Corporation, St Louis, the Lockheed factory, the Consolidated Aircraft Corporation, San Diego, and the Packard Company. He furnished a report to Sullivan dated 16 January 1941 in which he outlined the American context which supported the building of combined factories and referred Sullivan to his 1919 brochure: Modern Industrial Development. Two years later he published such a scheme for Aotea wharf in Wellington.
Town planning.
The 1925 and 1940 exhibitions also provided Anscombe with opportunities to suggest urban redevelopment schemes which would impact on each host city long after the period of the exhibition. In an article from June 1924, Anscombe outlined a proposal for a highway reserve, a park system, city zoning and housing, influenced by "the park and parkway system of Kansas City" and in keeping with Anscombe's "municipal housekeeping on scientific lines" outlined in his 1915 paper: "The Economic Value of Scientific Town Planning." The proposal was not implemented exactly as Anscombe suggested yet much of his intention has persisted, including the tree-lined Anzac Avenue and Logan Park, in Dunedin. This desire to ensure that temporary projects also served longer-term strategies is also seen in the anticipation that, like the San Francisco Treasure Island Fair, the 1940 New Zealand Centennial Exhibition buildings should be reconverted for use as airport buildings and that exhibition art galleries should be permanent. He also proposed an urban scheme for Wellington with a similar interest in long-term "betterments." Here he argued for an exhibition site close to central Wellington, in preference to Rongotai, maintaining that the central location was important and provided an opportunity "to carry out a much-needed improvement work" in the Adelaide road area. This central location was to take advantage of such already existing facilities as Government House, the Public Hospital, Wellington Boys' College, and the Museum and Art Gallery.
Architectural writing.
In addition to his architectural work Anscombe was an avid writer. During his lifetime he published a number of books and pamphlets and regularly published articles in local newspapers (both in Dunedin and in Wellington) writing on subjects ranging from urban planning and new building materials to the recollections of his travels. Anscombe's next travel overseas was an extensive tour of Canada and the United States where he visited "over fifty Canadian and American cities" in 1922. On this trip he learnt about building methods and town planning and continued his "keen interest in the construction of museums and art galleries ... making a special study of these buildings." The year following his return, his wife Douglas died aged 49, on 11 September 1923.
Final years.
Anscombe died on 9 October 1948, working up until his death. His funeral was held two days later at St John's Presbyterian church, Willis St on 11 October 1948. He was cremated at Karori and is buried in Andersons Bay Cemetery in Dunedin. His will was filed on 20 October, his estate valued at £20,757 17 shillings and 8 pence. In addition to relatives, St John's Presbyterian Church and the Crippled Children Society Wellington Branch were beneficiaries. An obituary in October 1948 in the "Dominion", noted of the funeral that:
"The New Zealand Institute of Architects was represented and nearly every member of the Wellington branch attended. Most of the leading building firms of the city were also generously represented."

1959 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (first game)

The 1959 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 26th playing of the midsummer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues composing Major League Baseball. The game was played on July 7, 1959 at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, home of the Pittsburgh Pirates of the NL. The game resulted in a 5-4 victory for the National League. An unprecedented second game was scheduled for later in the season in Los Angeles, California.
Background.
In a break from tradition, the league scheduled a "doubleheader" as part of an effort to boost the players' pension fund. The first game was held on July 7 at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the home of the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League. The second game was held on August 3 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California, the home of the Los Angeles Dodgers also of the NL. The first game resulted in a 5-4 victory for the NL. The AL won the second game by a score of 5-3. The experiment of staging two All-Star Games each year continued through the 1962 season, after which the playing of one annual game resumed.

The Last Trump

"The Last Trump" is a science fiction short story by Isaac Asimov. It was first published in the June 1955 issue of "Fantastic Universe" and reprinted in the 1957 collection "Earth Is Room Enough". Although humorous, it deals "inter alia" with a serious subject; calendar reform.
Plot summary.
By order of the Council of Ascendants and approved of by the Chief, it is decided that the Day of Resurrection is due on Earth, despite the protestations of Etheriel, a junior Seraph with responsibility for the world. Whilst he seeks an audience with the Chief to plead for a stay of execution for "his" planet, the Last Trump is sounded, and as of January 1, 1957, time comes to a stop on Earth. 
A mysterious figure known only as R. E. Mann (a pun on Ahriman, the Persian name for Satan) makes his way across the world, seeing what has happened in the Hereafter and pleased with it. All the dead are coming back to life, naked and uncaring. He meets a former professor of history who observes that the people have indeed been judged and are not in heaven but hell.
Etheriel has his meeting with the Chief and argues that the date January 1, 1957, unqualified, is meaningless and that therefore the Day of Resurrection is meaningless.

<doc id="9767339" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9767339" title="Emmetropia">
Emmetropia

Emmetropia (from Greek "emmetros", "well-proportioned" or "fitting") describes the state of vision where an object at infinity is in sharp focus with the eye lens in a neutral or relaxed state. This condition of the normal eye is achieved when the refractive power of the cornea and the axial length of the eye balance out, which focuses rays exactly on the retina, resulting in perfect vision. An eye in a state of emmetropia requires no correction. 
Emmetropia is a state in which the eye is relaxed and focused on an object more than away. The light rays coming from that object are essentially parallel, and the rays are focused on the retina without effort (an emmetropic eye does not need corrective lenses). If the gaze shifts to something closer, light rays from the source are too divergent to be focused without effort. In other words, the eye is automatically focused on things in the distance unless a conscious effort is made to focus elsewhere. For a wild animal or human prehistorical ancestors, this arrangement would be adaptive because it allows for alertness to predators or prey at a distance.
Accommodation of the lens does not occur in emmetropia. In emmetropia, the lens is about 3.6 mm thick at the center; in accommodation, it thickens to about 4.5 mm. A relatively thin lens and relatively dilated pupil are also associated. The lens usually stiffens with age, causing less ability to focus when the eyes are not in a state of emmetropia.
Corrective eye surgery such as LASIK and PRK aims to correct anemmetropic vision. This is accomplished by ensuring the curvature of the cornea, the shape of the lens and their distances from each other and the retina are in harmony. By shaping the cornea, emmetropic vision can be achieved without corrective lenses. The correction for only emmetropic vision is often why patients are still advised to wear glasses to read as they age due to presbyopia.
Newborns begin hypermetropic and then undergo a myopic shift to become emmetropic.
Etymology.
"Emmetropia" is ultimately derived from Greek "en"/"em" ("in") + "metron" ("measure," not to be confused with "metr-"/"meter" "mother") + "op"["s"/"t"]- ("eye") + -"ia" ("condition"). Translated literally, the term indicates the condition of an eye's having in itself ("i.e.", without recourse to corrective lenses or other instruments) the capability to obtain an accurate measurement of an object's physical appearance.

The Author's Ordeal

The Author's Ordeal are lyrics to a song written by science fiction author Isaac Asimov. They were first published in "Science Fiction Quarterly", May 1957, pp. 34–36. They are included in three collections of Asimov's short stories: "Earth Is Room Enough", "The Far Ends of Time and Earth" (omnibus edition) and "The Complete Stories, Volume 1".
The lyrics pastiche the Gilbert and Sullivan patter song known as "the (Lord Chancellor's) Nightmare Song" from "Iolanthe". The song depicts the agonies he goes through in thinking up a new science fiction story. It notes that the process of devising a space opera is incompatible with living in the real world with all its "dull facts of life that hound you".

Kemi railway station (in Finnish: "Kemin rautatieasema") is located in the town of Kemi in the Lapland Province of Finland. It is operated by VR. The distance to the Helsinki Central railway station, via Haapamäki and Oulu stations is 858.3 kilometres.
The station lies between the Kemi centre and Finnish national road 4, near the town centre services. All passenger trains stop at the station, and the station has a ticket office, a waiting room and a Junamaatti ticket vending machine. Kemi also has a lot of cargo traffic.
Kemi no longer has train traffic operators, instead the traffic is controlled remotely from Oulu. Track switching in cargo traffic requires a lot of trackyard personnel.
Although the tracks to Rovaniemi and to Kolari via Tornio actually separate at the Laurila cargo station north of Kemi, Kemi is an important junction for train traffic. From the Lautiosaari switch north of Kemi, there is also a side track to the Elijärvi mine.
Trackyards.
The Kemi station has a large trackyard, divided into personnel train tracks and a cargo trackyard. The trackyard was completely renovated and electrified from 2001 to 2003.
The station also has a side track to the Ajos harbour. On this side track are the trackyards of Veitsiluoto, Rivi and Ajos.

Dragove ("San Leonardo, Porto Dragon, Villa Dragova" in Italian) is a village in the north-eastern part of the island of Dugi otok (Long Island) in Zadar County, Croatia. Dragove is located on the regional road running along the entire island. The population is 35 (census 2011).
The surroundings were populated as early as antique times (Roman remains below the hill of Dumbovica), while the first Croatian settlement was mentioned in the sources already in the 14th century. Later, many Croats settled in Dragove fleeing the Turkish invasions of Bosnia. The Drago family from Zadar had its estates here, purchased in the 15th century by another Zadar family, the Salomonis. The parish church of St. Leonardo was built in the 12th and 13th century. The small church of Our Lady of Dumbovica, mentioned in the 15th century, is on a beautiful location, with a nice view on the surroundings. During the 1950s Dragove's population reached about 500 people.

Asian Literary Prize

The Asian Literary Prize (formerly the Man Asian Literary Prize 2007-2012), is an annual literary award given to the best novel by an Asian writer, either written in English or translated into English, and published in the previous calendar year. It is awarded to writers who are citizens or residents of one of the following 34 (out of 50) Asian countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, East Timor, India, Indonesia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, North Korea, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Tajikistan, Thailand, The Hong Kong or Macau SAR's, The Maldives, The PRC of China, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Vietnam. Submissions are invited through publishers who are entitled to each submit two novels by August 31 each year. Entry forms are available from May.
From 2010-2012, the Man Asian Literary Prize awarded USD 30,000 to the author and an additional USD 5,000 to the translator (if any). For the prize of the first three years of its running, from 2007–09, the Man Asian Literary Prize awarded USD 10,000 (author)/ 3,000 USD (translator) to a novel written by an Asian writer of the elective countries, either in English or translated into English, and yet unpublished. Submissions were made by the authors. The reason given by the Prize for the changes introduced in 2010 include the difficulty in finding talented unpublished authors. With the new format, which has shortlisted and winning novels already available to the literary community, media and general public, the Man Asian Literary Prize recognises “the best English works each year by Asian authors and aims to significantly raise international awareness and appreciation of Asian literature.”
From 2007-2012, the Man Asian Literary Prize was sponsored by Man Group plc., title sponsor of the Man Booker Prize. It was announced in October 2012 that Man Group would no longer sponsor the prize after the 2012 winner was announced in 2013. The award was looking for a new sponsor and in the interim would be called the "Asian Literary Prize".

Ray Gripper

Raymond Arthur Gripper (born 7 July 1938), in Salisbury, Rhodesia, was a cricketer. He was a right-handed opening batsman and became a regular member of the Rhodesian side for 15 years starting in 1957–58, at one stage captaining them. His highest score was an innings of 279 not out made against Orange Free State in 1967–68. This remained a Currie Cup record for some years. His son Trevor played Test cricket for Zimbabwe, also as an opening batsman.
Personal life.
Gripper was born on 7 July 1938, in Salisbury, Rhodesia, which is now the city of Harare in Zimbabwe. Gripper worked as a farmer, before turning his attention towards cricket. He has one son, Trevor Gripper, who has played test and ODI cricket for Zimbabwe.
Cricket career.
Gripper made his debut for the Rhodesian cricket team in the 1957–58 season, playing 83 first class games in the Currie Cup for the territory between 1957–58 and 1971–72. He had an unbroken run playing for the team for eight years between 1958 and 1966, when he was dropped for a game against Transvaal. He later managed to get back into the team however, and he scored his best score of 279 not out against Orange Free State in the 1967–68 season. This score was a Currie Cup record for many years. Gripper also occasionally bowled some right-arm medium pace, taking 3 wickets at an average of forty runs apiece in his first class career.
Administrator.
Following his retirement as a cricketer in the 1971–72 season citing "business pressures", Gripper became involved in the administrative side of Rhodesian, and later Zimbabwean cricket. Gripper continued to be a leading administrator within the game until the situation within Zimbabwe Cricket began to deteriorate during the Zimbabwean cricket crisis, whereupon he resigned from the board. Gripper then became a prominent critic of the direction in which cricket was heading in Zimbabwe, notably accusing Zimbabwe Cricket chairman Peter Chingoka of corruption over payments he received "for service to cricket for 21 years", as well as criticising the structure of Zimbabwe Cricket which had stripped the players and provincial associations of voting power, thus making it impossible to remove Chingoka. He also described the managing board of Zimbabwe Cricket as a group of "money-grabbers only in the game for what they can get out of it".
Gripper has also been accused by some of being involved in the players strike that crippled the country's national team during the Zimbabwe Cricket Crisis. Gripper was approached by ZCU chairman Ozias Bvute in an attempt to negotiate a compromise deal with the rebel players.

Edwards Point (Victoria)

Edwards Point is a 4 km long sand spit extending southwards between Swan Bay and Port Phillip Bay, at the eastern end of the Bellarine Peninsula, Victoria, Australia. It is about 115 km by road south-west of Melbourne and 40 km east of Geelong.
The township of St Leonards lies at its northern end. With Duck Island and Swan Island it forms the part-barrier that separates Swan Bay from Port Phillip.
Edwards Point Wildlife Reserve.
The spit is entirely included within the Edwards Point Wildlife Reserve, established in March 1971 to protect the vegetation communities and fauna of the area. These communities include the last remaining stand of coastal woodland on the Bellarine Peninsula, saltmarsh and beach. The adjacent Swan Bay contains extensive areas of intertidal mudflats that are important for waterbirds and migratory waders. The end of the spit is a high tide roost for waders.
The spit is part of the Swan Bay and Port Phillip Bay Islands Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International. Birds of conservation significance for which the area is known include the critically endangered Orange-bellied Parrot as well as the Little Tern, Fairy Tern, Eastern Curlew, Lewin's Rail and White-bellied Sea-eagle. It has also supported over 1% of the Australian population of four wader species: Grey Plover, Pacific Golden Plover, Double-banded Plover and Eastern Curlew.

Dreaming Is a Private Thing

"Dreaming Is a Private Thing" is a science fiction short story by Isaac Asimov, first published in the December 1955 issue of "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction" and reprinted in the 1957 collection "Earth is Room Enough". Asimov's original title for the story was "A Hundred Million Dreams at Once", but F&SF editor Tony Boucher changed it, and Asimov liked the new title so kept it.
Plot summary.
Jesse Weill is founder and owner of Dreams Inc, a company that produces dreams for the individual's private use, just as films used to be viewed, although they've been superseded by 'dreamies'. Dreamies can be viewed in private at home by anyone with the equipment and cash to buy or rent them (like present day videos or DVDs). They are produced by specially trained individuals, often social loners or eccentrics as a result of their intensive training over many years.
Weill is shown a new development—under-the-counter pornographic dreamies—and asked by the government to assist in cracking down on them. Meanwhile, he interviews a ten year old boy as a potential dreamer, a lucrative occupation if he turns out to be suitable and undergoes training.
He also gets told by one of his best dreamers that he does not want to work any more, as it is ruining family life, the dreamer also feels he has lost himself. But Weill knows from experience that the dreamer can't stop dreaming once he's become used to that way of life, even if he wants to.
One of Weill's staff tells him that a competing company is opening a chain of 'dream palaces', where everyone can absorb the same dream simultaneously, but he is of the opinion that it will not work. As he says, dreaming is a private thing.

Kugluk/Bloody Falls Territorial Park (Inuinnaqtun: "kugluk"; English: waterfall) is located about southwest of Kugluktuk, Nunavut, Canada. The park is situated around the Bloody Falls on the Coppermine River and was listed as a national historic site in 1978.
The park is probably best known as the site of the Bloody Falls Massacre that occurred when Samuel Hearne's Chipewyan guides massacred a group of Copper Inuit they found camped at the falls.
Ethnography.
The area, both inside and outside the current park boundaries, was used by both Inuit and First Nations people stretching back over thousands of years. Although the park today lies outside of the modern range of the Bathurst caribou herd (named for Bathurst Inlet) the area was a major hunting ground. Evidence, such as antler huts, show that it was used by both groups as a major Barren-ground Caribou hunting region. The river and falls were also a major fishing area and remain so today.
Dene.
Taltheilei Shale Tradition, pre-historic ancestors of the Dene, campsites about 1500 years old, may be found in the area. There is also evidence of 7000 year old Indian campsites.
Inuit.
Early Paleoeskimo (Pre-Dorset culture) sites are found here and have been dated to over 3500 years. Within the last 500 years the Thule people built stone houses in the park.
Today.
With the division of the Northwest Territories in 1999 the area is less used by the Dene than in previous times. Inuit from Kugluktuk still travel to the area to fish and hunt but the park is mainly a tourist attraction. The park can be reached by motorboat, about 45 minutes, all-terrain vehicle, about two hours or by a four to five hour walk. The park also provides a camping spot for canoeists travelling along the river and a special portage trail has been constructed. The campsite is situated just below the falls and is called "Onoagahiovik" in Inuinnaqtun. There are plans to build an information booth in the park and a "comfort station" is already in place.
Geography.
The area is typical Arctic tundra and along the sides of the river are the cliffs that lead to the falls. Rocky escarpments can be found and it is possible to see the Arctic Ocean from hills within the park. The fast flowing river, normally fairly wide, is forced through the cliffs in the park and create the falls before spreading out again.
Fauna.
Besides caribou, a visitor to the park may observe barren-ground grizzly bears and wolverines. Bird species such as the Golden Eagle, Rough-legged Hawk, Peregrine Falcon, Gyrfalcon, and swallows may be observed in the park. The last are found in large numbers and nest in the cliffs around the falls.
Flora.
Although the park falls north of the tree line, stunted trees such as the Dwarf Willow do occur alongside the Coppermine River. The black-tipped groundsel ("Senecio lugens") is also found in the park. The plant was named by John Richardson while travelling the river with John Franklin in 1821 during his first expedition. The word "lugens" is derived from the Latin word "to mourn" and is supposed to commemorate the massacre.

MV Levina 1

The Levina 1 was an Indonesian passenger ferry. On February 22, 2007, it caught fire, killing at least 51 people. Three days later, on February 25, it sank with a group of journalists and investigators on board, killing at least one more and leaving three missing.
Construction.
The "Levina 1" was a 2,000-ton vessel built in Japan in 1980. It was owned and operated by PT Praga Jaya Sentosa.
Fire.
On February 22, 2007, the "Levina 1" was en route from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, to the island of Bangka. The vessel caught fire several hours after leaving port, prior to dawn, at a location from the start port of Tanjung Priok. Hundreds of passengers escaped the burning ship by jumping into the Java Sea. Over 290 people had to be rescued. At least 51 people were killed in the disaster, but the Indonesian Red Cross says the number of deaths could be as high as 89. The ship's log claimed the ship was carrying 228 passengers, 42 trucks and eight cars, but the navy claims it had at least 350 passengers on board. It is common for logs of passengers to be left uncompleted and boats to be overloaded in Indonesia. In reference to the incomplete manifest, Transport Minister Hatta Rajasa said: "It is a big mistake that the ferry company never registered the identity of children passengers. It is a big, big mistake. I am going to give them heavy sanctions for that."
Rescue effort.
The ferry's sister ship, "Levina II", rescued many passengers, as did the Filipino ship "Princess Vanessa". In total, two warships, three helicopters, a tug boat and nine cargo ships participated in the search and rescue operation. The injured were either transported straight to hospital, or treated at a makeshift centre set up at the port. 60 people were able to swim to a nearby island.
Sinking.
After the fire had been extinguished, tugboat "TB Jayakarta III" towed the ship into the waters of Tanjung Priok on February 24. The following day, a party of four investigators and twelve journalists were taken to the ship by a police boat. The reporters came from the "Indosiar", "Metro TV", "ANTV", "Lativi (later TvOne)", "RCTI" and "SCTV" TV stations and the "Elshinta" radio station. Many of those who boarded did not put on lifevests; although they had been available, the police had not made them mandatory. The ferry was still under tow at the time, being seven nautical miles (13 km) from the port itself. It was already listing slightly prior to the party boarding the wreck, and the group had been previously warned the ferry wasn't safe. The Indonesian investigative authority, the KNKT, had not given the group permission to board, but they saw other journalists on board, and followed suit. Once on board the hulk, the journalists went to deck three where they interviewed the head of the city's Water Police, Adj. Sr. Comr. Frederik Kalembang. Shortly after the party boarded the vessel, it suddenly listed sharply. Police officers monitoring the vessel from a nearby boat used a loudspeaker to order an immediate evacuation of the ship. Most of those on board rushed down to deck two, where they escaped via a window at the end of the deck. The ship sank within five minutes. One six-man lifeboat nearly capsized due to being heavily overloaded. One "Lativi" cameraman subsequently died in hospital, and three other people – two police forensics officers and a "SCTV" cameraman – remain unaccounted for. Four more people were seriously injured. Diving operations on the wreck failed to locate the bodies of the deceased.
Investigation.
An investigation was launched after the twin disasters by the National Transport Safety Committee and the Police Forensic Laboratory. The investigation established that the fire started in a truck on the car deck. It is believed to have been a chemical fire, as the ship's crew reported that when they attempted to douse the tarpaulin-covered truck with water, the ferocity of the fire increased. The trucker's ticketing agency shows that one of the trucks was loaded with cases of premixed petroleum, a rare and expensive commodity in Indonesia. The ship's captain was interviewed as part of the investigative procedure. Preliminary reports suggest that negligence on the part of the operator, PT Praga Jaya Sentosa, contributed to the disaster. The investigation revealed that no inspection of the boat's documents was conducted prior to departure. The vessel's skipper, as well as four other crew members, were also the subject of a criminal investigation regarding possible negligence.
Aftermath.
Setyo Rahardho, head of the National Transport Safety Commission, said that "journalists will not be allowed to accompany investigators any more", in the aftermath of the disasters. Hatta Radjasa, Indonesian Minister for Transportation, personally ordered the Directorate of Sea Transportation to revoke PT Praga Jaya Sentosa's license in response to the inaccurate passenger manifests. The directorate did so, and also suspended local harbourmaster J. Karelantang over his responsibility regarding the misleading documents. The captain, Andi Kurniawan, and the first officer, Sunaryo, were arrested after the disaster and charged with negligence.
The International Maritime Organization (IMO) reiterated an offer made to Indonesia in late 2006 (after over 400 people died in the sinking of "Senopati Nusantara" and "Tri Star 1") to assist with aiding ferry safety. This time, Indonesia accepted, and the IMO made recommendations which resulted in the establishment of an action plan.

Pieksämäki railway station

The Pieksämäki railway station is located in the town of Pieksämäki, Finland. The station has been in use since the track to Savonia was built in 1889.
History.
The representatives of the Pieksämäki area, most importantly Aapeli Häyrinen, were strong supporters of the Savonia railway, and were also present in the discussion of a perpendicular track in the early 20th century. The track would combine the parallel tracks of Ostrobothnia, Savonia and Karelia, but there was controversy about the actual layout. When Savonlinna received a railway connection from the east in 1908, the situation was clarified, and the track between Savonlinna and Pieksämäki was built in 1914. At the same time, a side track from Huutokoski to Varkaus was built, and the Pieksämäki station became more important, of class 3. Already at this time, there was an agreement on the best western layout for the perpendicular track (the Pieksämäki station had faced competition from a track between Suonenjoki and Suolahti), and so the track was extended from Pieksämäki towards Jyväskylä, being completed by the time of Finland's independence and the Finnish Civil War in 1918. Having thus became a crossing point in the Finnish railway network, the Pieksämäki station was promoted to class 2.
The completion of the perpendicular track meant a rise of importance for the Pieksämäki station, and it soon got its own restaurant. The proximity of the railroad had also resulted in another habitation centre near the station, and in the 1920s, it outgrew the old Tienristi, thus becoming the centre of the area. The separate Pieksämäki village became a market town called "Pieksämä" in 1930, but the Finnish Railway Institute did not rename the station. Later, the city council changed its mind, and Pieksämä was renamed back to Pieksämäki in 1948. During World War II, the important crossing point station was the target of many bombings, and the station restaurant also burned down. Nevertheless, traffic increased both during and after the war. This was partly because of a track between Varkaus and Joensuu, built in 1940.
ämäki became a central place for the VR Group, receiving a repair shop and a depot. The trackyard is one of the largest in Finland, over 6 kilometres long, with almost 100 kilometres of track.
The current central traffic station at Pieksämäki was completed in 1981. Pieksämäki is the terminus for many passenger trains, and all trains passing it also stop at the station. It is nowadays a control station, because traffic control in the nearby railway traffic points are handled remotely from Pieksämäki.
Services.
There is also bus traffic from the station.

Slaty-breasted tinamou

The slaty-breasted tinamou or Boucard's tinamou ("Crypturellus boucardi") is a type of tinamou commonly found in lowland moist forests of Central America. Although the slaty-breasted tinamou is recognized by most authorities, the SACC still classifies this bird as a sub-species of "Crypturellus erythropus", red-legged tinamou.
Taxonomy.
All tinamou are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.
The slaty-breasted tinamou has two sub-species: 
Philip Sclater identified the slaty-breasted tinamou from a specimen from Oaxaca, Mexico, in 1859.
Etymology.
"Crypturellus" can be broken down into the following: "kruptos" meaning covered or hidden, "oura" meaning the tail and "ellus" meaning diminutive. Therefore "Crypturellus" means the small covered tail. Finally, "boucardi" is the Latin form of Boucard to commemorate Adolphe Boucard.
Range and habitat.
Range.
It is commonly found in lowland moist forest in subtropical and tropical regions up to altitude. This species ranges along the Gulf of Mexico coast from southern Mexico, from southern Vera Cruz and northern Oaxaca south, to northern Costa Rica. Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica.
Habitat.
It prefers thick evergreen forests with thick undergrowth, but also can be found in thick forests with little undergrowth, secondary forests, and on regenerating plantations. It likes moist areas as well.
Description.
The slaty-breasted tinamou averages in length, and weighs about . Its back and head are black to chestnut in color, brown on its wings, slaty grey on its breast, white on its throat, grey-brown on remainder of its underparts with darker barring on flanks and undertail. The female has barring on its wings. Its legs are pink to bright red, and its bill is dark above and yellow below.
Behavior.
It is a shy and difficult tinamou to be seen on the dark forest floors. Its call is a three-note call and lower than other tinamous. Its calls can be in long bouts, up to five hours at a time. This tinamou and the thicket tinamou will produce hybrids on occasion.
Feeding.
Like other tinamous, it feeds on fruit and seeds and some invertebrates, in particular, ants and termites.
Reproduction.
The slaty-breasted tinamou male attracts 2 to 4 females to lay in its nest on the ground and in thick vegetation or between the raised roots of a tree. The male incubates and raises the young. Females will mate with more than one male.
Conservation.
The IUCN has classified the slaty-breasted as Least Concern and it has an occurrence range of . It is hunted for food but its numbers seem to be consistent.

Anvil (insecticide)

Anvil is an insecticide widely employed to combat West Nile Virus, a mosquito-borne disease identified in approximately 10,000 residents of the United States from 1999-2006. It is sprayed in Chicago and many other cities. Sumithrin, a synthetic pyrethroid, is the main active ingredient. 
Anvil is applied aerially via fixed-wing and rotary aircraft or via ground applications (truck/ATV/backpack) using ultra-low volume (ULV) sprayers. According to the Anvil Technical Bulletin published in January 2006, these sprayers create a fine mist of drops that average 17 micrometres in size -- smaller than the size of a pinhead. A very small amount of active ingredient is used; about 6 tenths of an ounce of active ingredient is used to treat an acre (4.2 kg/km²). 
The active ingredients in Anvil break down quickly in sunlight and do not bioaccumulate. There are no reentry precautions for Anvil. 
Anvil has been tested in 43 field trials in the United States against 30 mosquito species. 
History.
Sumithrin was registered for use by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1975 and Anvil is registered for ground and aerial application in outdoor residential and recreational areas. Anvil is manufactured and distributed by Clarke Mosquito Control. Clarke Mosquito Control Anvil Page
In 2003, Anvil was used to treat more than a million acres (4,000 km²) in Larimer County, Colorado during a West Nile Virus outbreak. According to the Anvil Technical Bulletin, this application reduced mosquito populations by approximately 80 percent.
In 2006, Anvil was used in Massachusetts after Governor Mitt Romney declared a state of emergency after Eastern Equine Encephalitis was identified in large quantities in mosquito populations.
Controversy.
No-spray protests have called for more organic methods of preventing West Nile due to concerns about the health and environmental effects of the spray as well as recent studies showing the ineffectiveness of the spray.
Adding to the controversy is the participation in the public debate of CEI, a think tank founded by the oil industry which has also worked to spin the media to confusion over global warming.

Rape Fantasies

"Rape Fantasies" is a short story by the Canadian author Margaret Atwood. The story, notable for its dark humour, was originally published in the Canadian edition of "Dancing Girls" in 1977. The story gained greater attention and study when it was later published in the 1985 edition of Norton Anthology of Literature by Women.
Plot summary.
The story centers around its narrator, a woman named Estelle, discussing her feelings and fantasies on rape. She recounts a story about her lunch break with her co-workers, where they discuss their fantasies of rape over a card game. While her friends all have romanticized rape fantasies, Estelle breaks the trend by having humorous turns of events in her fantasies that help her thwart the rape attempt. In her stories she manages to escape rape in many ways, from having the rapist help her get lemon juice to squirt in his eyes, to helping the rapist get to the bottom of his emotional problems. Concerned that her rape fantasies are abnormal, she continues to share more and more stories, none involving an actual rape.

Back Off Cupids

Back Off Cupids was the name of a solo musical project by the San Diego, California musician John Reis. The project took place in 1994, in between sessions with Reis' bands Drive Like Jehu and Rocket from the Crypt. Rocket from the Crypt horn players Jason Crane and Paul O'Beirne were also involved in the project, though the vast majority of the recording was conducted by Reis. Recording took place with friend and fellow musician Gar Wood in his garage.
The music produced by Back Off Cupids was significantly different from Reis' other musical endeavors. While his previous groups had explored genres such as rock and roll, post punk, and post-hardcore in an aggressive fashion, Back Off Cupids was slower, mostly instrumental, and to a certain degree free-form. It most closely resembles Drive Like Jehu in its complexity and intricate song structures, but lacks the aggression and raspy vocals of that group.
Recording of the Back Off Cupids material was completed in 1994, but with the exception of a few songs that appeared on compilations it remained mostly unreleased for several years. Reis left the material shelved for the most part, occasionally mixing and tweaking the arrangements in between touring and recording with Rocket from the Crypt. In 1999, during a period in which Rocket from the Crypt were not as active, Reis completed mixing the material and released it as an album through Drunken Fish Records under the title "Back Off Cupids". Of Reis' many musical endeavors, Back Off Cupids remains the most obscure.

Cursor (magazine)

CURSOR - Programs for PET Computers was the name of an early computer-based "magazine" that was distributed on cassette from 1978 and into the early 1980s. Each issue, consisting of the cassette itself and a short newsletter including a table of contents, contained programs, utilities, and games. Produced for users of the Commodore PET, and available by subscription only, "CURSOR" was a forerunner of the later disk magazines ("diskmags") that came about as floppy disk drives became common, and eventually ubiquitous, in home and personal computing during the 1980s.
Ron Jeffries and Glen Fisher, of the software company The Code Works of Goleta, California, was "CURSOR"'s publisher and editor, respectively. 
Each issue came with five or six programs, preceded by a "cover page" program (which was initially a simple animation, but in later issues became more sophisticated, allowing the user to select a program to be loaded from the tape). Among programs circulated by "CURSOR" included rudimentary animations, such as ""Dromeda"", which was an adaptation of the film "The Andromeda Strain"; games, such as a version of the "Star Trek" text-based campaign game, ""Twonky"" (a version of "Hunt the Wumpus"), and ""Ratrun"", an early dungeon crawl-style game (only with the player as a mouse searching for a piece of cheese in a 3D maze); and simple utility programs such as spreadsheets and code-tweakers (including a utility that allowed the PET to display lower-case lettering). Initially, programs (specifically games and animations) distributed on "Cursor" did not have sound, as the PET did not initially have this capability. As external audio devices such as "Soundware" became available for PET models, sound-capable programs began to appear in "Cursor"; these programs were identified by an exclamation point (!) in the title. For example: "Aliens!" or "Dromeda!".
"CURSOR" was discontinued in the early 1980s when the PET was superseded by other platforms. In total, 30 issues of the magazine were published. Issue #30 had the date May, 1982.

<doc id="9767819" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9767819" title="Australian Hydrographic Service">
Australian Hydrographic Service

The Australian Hydrographic Service (formerly known as the Royal Australian Navy Hydrographic Service) is the Australian Commonwealth Government agency responsible for providing hydrographic services that meet Australia's obligations under the SOLAS convention and the national interest; enabling safe navigation, maritime trade and supporting protection of the marine environment. The agency, headquartered at the Australian Hydrographic Office in Wollongong, New South Wales, is an element of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), and serves both military and civilian functions. The names Australian Hydrographic Service and the Australian Hydrographic Office are commonly abbreviated as AHS or AHO respectively.
Role.
The Australian Hydrographic Service is an element of the RAN, and serves both military and civilian functions. The headquarters of the agency is at the Australian Hydrographic Office in Wollongong, New South Wales. Hydrographic services provided by the AHS include the mapping and surveying of undersea terrain and irregularities on and under the water's surface (known collectively as hydrography), the provision of nautical charts and other publications, such as tide tables and Notices to Mariners. Over 400 paper charts are produced by the AHS, with conversion of these to electronic navigational chart format due to be completed in 2011.
Under international agreements, the Australian charting area spans approximately one-eighth of the world's surface, extending from Cocos Island to the west, the Solomon Islands to the east, the Equator to the north, and Antarctica to the south.
History.
Following the work of explorers, the British Admiralty established a Chart and Chronometer Depot in Sydney in 1897. The depot was to supplement the activities of Royal Navy survey ships in Australian waters. In 1913, the depot was taken over by the Australian government and was renamed the RAN Hydrographic Depot. Despite this, survey activities were performed by Royal Navy vessels until World War I, when surveying operations were concentrated in European waters.
After the war, the Admiralty decided that with higher priorities in Europe, it would provide at most a single vessel for survey operations around Australia, and the Australian government was forced to create its own hydrographic surveying service. After deliberation on whether the new hydrographic service would be military or civilian operated, the government decided that surveying would be a naval responsibility, with the RAN Hydrographic Service established on 1 October 1920. A single sloop, , was commissioned into RAN service to supplement the Royal Navy survey vessel, and was later fitted with a Fairey IIID seaplane to assist with surveys of the Great Barrier Reef. "Geranium" was replaced by , but the new survey ship was placed in reserve once the Great Barrier Reef survey was completed in 1929. By this point, no other survey operations (military or civilian) were being performed in Australian waters.
Surveying operations did not resume in the region until World War II, when it became evident that Age of Sail-era charts of the South West Pacific desperately needed updating. Requesitioned auxiliary ships, later supplemented by several "Bathurst" class corvettes modified into survey vessels, were used to chart the waters around the East Indies and New Guinea, with the RAN designated as the charting authority responsible for supporting Allied operations in the South West Pacific Area. As well as updating navigational charts, RAN survey ships were also used to inspect and clear sites for amphibious landings. By the end of the war, sixteen vessels were attached to the Hydrographic Service, including the frigate and five "Bathurst" class corvettes.
In 1946, the Australian Cabinet decided that the RAN would remain in control of all hydrographic operations in both Australian waters and areas of Australian interest. RAN warships were used to survey waters around Australia as part of a national hydrographic survey. In 1947, the Antarctic exploration ship was commissioned, but only one voyage was completed, and RAN hydrographic operations in the Antarctic were stopped in 1948. In 1963, a resource and export boom required the Hydrographic Service to change its focus from a comprehensive national survey to the charting of new ports and shipping routes suitable for deep-draught merchant ships. A purpose-built survey ship, entered service in 1964. Survey of ports and shipping routes was completed by 1974. From 1979 onwards, the Hydrographic Service began to provide hydrographic assistance and training to Pacific island nations. During 1989 and 1990, four "Paluma" class survey ships entered service with the RAN, followed by two larger "Leeuwin" class ships in 1999. In 1993, the RAN began to use Laser Airborne Depth Sounder (LADS) technology to asistin surveying: this was first fitted to a Fokker F27 aircraft, then in 2010 was installed in a De Havilland Dash 8, operated by the Laser Airborne Depth Sounder Flight.

Ptisana purpurascens

Ptisana purpurascens is a large fern belonging to the botanical family Marattiaceae. It has a globular rhizome with stipule-like fleshy outgrowths. The leaves are dark green, twice pinnate and up to 1 metre long. Every pinnule has up to six pairs of leaflets. The petioles are dark-purplish, hence the name 'purpurascens' meaning 'becoming purple'. The sporangia are fused in all "Ptisana" into a bivalvate synangium.
Conservation plans have been proposed for "Ptisana purpurascens", an endemic of the distant Ascension Island in the South Atlantic, where a single population remains on Green Mountain. While the mature plants are still present in large numbers, long-term threats to its survival exist in the form of competition with alien invasive species like introduced plants such as "Buddleja madagascariensis" and grazing by sheep and rabbits. Successful reproduction is very rare, making the species highly endangered.

<doc id="9767863" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9767863" title="Zeraphine">
Zeraphine

Zeraphine is a gothic alternative rock band from Berlin, Germany, formed in 2000 by Sven Friedrich (vocals, programming, lead song writing) and Norman Selbig (guitars) from the then-defunct Dreadful Shadows.
History.
After the acclaimed goth rock band Dreadful Shadows decided to split and go their separate ways, Sven and Norman collaborated with ex-Dreadful Shadows producer Thommy Hein on a project called Helix. However, since the Helix name was taken by another band, they were forced to rename themselves Zeraphine – taken from the Hebrew Bible’s concepts of the "seraph" (or "seraphim"), a class of angel in traditional Judaism and Orthodox Christianity. Once Zeraphine, the band signed onto the Drakkar Entertainment record label.
Originally, additional band members Manuel Senger (guitars), Michael Nepp (bass), and Marcellus Puhlemann (drums) joined the project as studio musicians. This changed after their debut album was released, and each member began contributing music and ideas to all following releases.
Zeraphine’s debut album, "Kalte Sonne" (2002), gained notoriety for its lyrics; unlike Dreadful Shadows, whose songs were written entirely in English, Sven elected to pen an album completely in German, citing that “I simply tried to transfer my style of writing to my mother tongue and I liked it quite a lot. I always thought it would be impossible.” Their following album, "Traumaworld" (2003), saw Sven return to English, with only two songs written in German. Tonally, the album’s lyrics were harsher, as the band drew inspiration from their feelings on the Iraq war. However, when it came to promoting the album, the more upbeat "Be My Rain" (2003) was chosen as the single. A music video was made for "Be My Rain" (consisting of live footage), and a limited promo CD was released, featuring album, radio, and club mixes of the title track, and a cover of the Depeche Mode song "In Your Room".
In 2004, Zeraphine joined HIM on an acclaimed tour of Europe, which exposed the band to an even wider audience. In anticipation for the tour, Zeraphine hit the studio again to record the single "New Year’s Day" (2004), featuring a cover version of the U2 song, and two other original tracks. Promptly after the tour finished, Zeraphine again entered the studio and churned out another single, "Die Macht In Dir" (2004), which promised a full album at the beginning of the following year. The single, as well as the title track, consisted of alternative versions of "Kaltes Herz", "Die Macht In Dir", (and on the limited edition release) "Until I Finally Drown". "Blind Camera" (2005) was released with a positive response by both fans and critics, and sent Zeraphine on the road once more, headlining their own trip across Europe. A particular point of well-reception was the balance in German and English lyrics – nearly half the songs on "Blind Camera" are written in German. The record itself was written as a semi-concept album, dealing with themes such as perception and reality.
In 2006, Zeraphine announced that they were severing their ties with their label, Drakkar Entertainment, so that they could have more creative control over their next record. "Still" (2006), released on the Phonyx Records label (a record label managed by the band themselves, and producer Thommy Hein), was handled with noticeably less ‘polish’ than their previous albums. This was per the band’s decision to move to a less studio-oriented, more live sounding style of recording. Two editions of the album were released, a regular and an enhanced version; the enhanced featuring an additional song, and the music video (and outtakes) to the title track and single, "Still". The record’s title is meant to represent both its German and English meanings, commenting on the duality of the album’s lyrical content.
The band was decidedly less active in 2007, when Sven and Norman rejoined Dreadful Shadows for live shows exclusively. Also during this time, Sven began working on a side project, an electronic solo project titled Solar Fake. A compilation album was also released during this time, titled "Years in Black" (2007), by Phoynx Records and Drakkar Entertainment; It contained songs from all four albums, and while no unreleased material was put on it (an update on their official website cited such an act as a ‘fan rip-off’), the currently out-of-print radio mix of "Be My Rain" was added in place of the album version. Zeraphine continued to tour and do festivals throughout 2007 and 2008, with a few new songs slipping into setlists during the later half of 2008.
As of March 2009, it is rumored that the band is working on a fifth album. In the end of month Zeraphine announced that new album is complete and it is planned to be released on June 11, 2010.

Orthodoxy in Serbia

Eastern Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Serbia, with 6,079,396 followers or 84.6% of the population, followed traditionally by the ethnic groups of Serbs, Romanians, Vlachs, Montenegrins, Macedonians and Bulgarians living in Serbia. The dominant church in Serbia is the Serbian Orthodox Church.
History.
The identity of ethnic Serbs was historically based on Orthodox Christianity; the Serbian Orthodox Church, to the extent that some people claimed that those who were not Orthodox, were not Serbs. The Christianization of the Serbian lands took place in the 9th century, and Serbia (the Serbian Principality) is accounted Christian as of 870, when the Eparchy of Ras and Braničevo were founded, confirmed by the Eighth Ecumenical Council (879-880). The Serbian bishoprics became part of the Archbishopric of Ohrid, after the Byzantine conquest of the Bulgarian Empire in 1018. The Greek language replaced the Slavic in liturgical language.
With the Great Schism in 1054 (the split between the Byzantine East and the Papal West), Serbia remained under Constantinople, while neighbouring Croatia remained under Rome. The Serbian Church was given autocephaly in 1219, when Archbishop Sava was recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarch.

Dummy, the Witch of Sible Hedingham

Dummy, the Witch of Sible Hedingham (c. 1788 – September 4, 1863) was the pseudonym of an unidentified elderly man who was one of the last people to be charged with witchcraft in England in the 19th century. 
A longtime resident of Sible Hedingham, Essex, a small farming village in the English countryside, he was a deaf-mute who earned a living as a local fortune teller. In September 1863, Dummy was accused by a local girl of bewitching her house in Ridgewell and dragged from "The Swan" tavern by a drunken mob. Thrown into a nearby brook as an "ordeal by water", he was also severely beaten with sticks before eventually taken to a workhouse in Halstead where he died of pneumonia. Following an investigation by authorities, Emma Smith and Samuel Stammers were charged with his death and tried at Chelmsford Assizes where they were sentenced to six months imprisonment on March 8, 1864.

He became the first Belarusian to win a medal at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships by winning a silver medal in the men's 15 km. This he achieved at the 2007 World Championships without any prior World Cup experience and with a previous best of 16th from the World Junior Championships in 2006. On the FIS distance ranking, he was placed 647th. However, the low ranking gave him an early start position in the 15 km freestyle, which helped as the late starters had to go through snowy tracks while Karneyenka avoided the snow. Karneyenka was described as "completely unknown" by several media sources, and the feat described as "sensational".

Back Off Cupids (album)

Back Off Cupids is a solo album by the San Diego, California musician John Reis, released in 2000 by Big Fish Records. "Back Off Cupids" was also the name given by Reis to the musical project. Recording of the album's material took place in 1994, in between sessions with Reis' bands Drive Like Jehu and Rocket From the Crypt, and involved Rocket From the Crypt horn players Jason Crane and Paul O'Beirne. Compared to Reis' other musical projects the music was slower, mostly instrumental, and to a certain degree free-form. The material was shelved for several years until mixing was completed in 1999, and the album was finally released in 2000.
Reception.
Ned Raggett of Allmusic gave "Back Off Cupids" four stars out of five, commenting that "At points the music is almost a complete turnaround from Reis' other work — consider the rumbling, structured speaker hum and sweet, sad aura of 'Can You Hear My Sleep Dog?,' a standout track. Perhaps the most telling thing about the Back Off Cupids is that while at points one can imagine either Reis or Drive Like Jehu's Rick Froberg singing over all the songs instead of just Reis here and there, the tunes still easily stand on their own. There's no better testament to Reis' skill and abilities."

The Feng Shui Detective

The Feng Shui Detective is a series of "comedy-crime" novels by Asian author Nury Vittachi.
Originally started on Hongkong.com, as a community-contributed short story, the published books started to appear in Hong Kong in 2000, but since have been printed around the world in multiple languages.
Characters and plot.
They tell the story of CF Wong, a feng shui master, who is forced to take on an assistant named Joyce McQuinnie. Expecting to be moving furniture, she discovers that Wong specializes in crime scenes. Communication between the two is fraught - Wong speaks a mixture of pidgin English, augmented by phrases learned from a text book, while Joyce communicates in impenetrable youth argot. Wong tends to be sexist, racist, money-oriented and likes to eat small animals, alive if possible. Joyce is politically correct and a vegetarian who speaks Sing-English (e.g. ends some sentences with "lah").
There are five books in the series, with the most recent entrant, "Mr. Wong Goes West", appearing in February, 2008. They have also been numerous "mini-mysteries" - short tales about the same characters - which have appeared in magazines in China.
The stories are widely seen as allegories of East and West ideologies and practices. Although the main players are suspicious of each other and find it almost impossible to communicate, resolution is only possible when they work together.

<doc id="9768087" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9768087" title="Choco tinamou">
Choco tinamou

The Choco tinamou or Chocó tinamou ("Crypturellus kerriae") is a type of tinamou found in lowland forest and montane forest in subtropical and tropical regions of Colombia and Panama.
Description.
The Choco tinamou is approximately in length. It is a small, plain dark tinamou. Its upperparts are dark brown, with blackish crown, slate-grey sides of neck, whitish throat and indistinct dusky barring. Its legs are red. The females are darker with coarser barring on wing-coverts and breast, and grey flanks.
Behavior.
It has a low, faint, mournful, three-note whistle voice. Like other tinamous, the Choco tinamou eats fruit off the ground or low-lying bushes. They also eat small amounts of invertebrates, flower buds, tender leaves, seeds, and roots. The male incubates the eggs which may come from as many as 4 different females, and then will raise them until they are ready to be on their own, usually 2–3 weeks. The nest is located on the ground in dense brush or between raised root buttresses.
Taxonomy.
The Choco tinamou is a monotypic species. All tinamou are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.
Etymology.
"Crypturellus" is formed from three Latin or Greek words. "kruptos" meaning covered or hidden, "oura" meaning tail, and "ellus" meaning diminutive. Therefore "Crypturellus" means small hidden tail.
Range.
This species is found in northwestern Chocó Department Colombia, and southern Darién Department Panama
Habitat.
The Choco tinamou resides in tropical and sub-tropical moist evergreen forests both lowland and montane up to altitude. However, it seems that it prefers higher elevations.
Threats.
The Choco tinamou is currently threatened by the vast destruction of its habitats caused by road construction, human settlement, timber extraction and mining. The completion of a new road-bridge has made unprotected areas of coastal plain forest adjacent to Ensenada de Utría National Park accessible to settlement and further threatens its habitats. The population at Atrato valley, Colombia, would probably be the most threatened caused by human settlement, and conversion to farmland and banana plantations. It is presumably hunted wherever humans are present. The completion of the Pan-American highway through Darién and the canalisation of the Truandó and lower Atrato Rivers, to make an inter-oceanic fairway, are currently on hold, but could have serious effects on the species if it is to be completed. The biggest threats are hunting, and the on-hold transportation plans.
Conservation measures.
The Choco tinamou is currently protected in Darién National Park, Panama, and Ensenada de Utría National Park, Colombia. Los Katíos National Park, Colombia, also protects of apparently suitable habitat in the Chocó region, but the species has yet to be recorded in the reserve. It was proposed to survey areas and study the ecology to provide an improved understanding of its status and distribution. The status of Choco tinamou is considered as Vulnerable because it is known from only a few locations within its small range where habitat is gradually disappearing. It has an occurrence range of , with a 2000 estimate of less than 10,000 adult birds (1500-5000 low end estimate).

<doc id="9768093" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9768093" title="Switch pitcher">
Switch pitcher

In baseball, a switch-pitcher is an ambidextrous pitcher who is able to pitch with both the right and left hand from the pitcher's mound.
Four 19th-century pitchers are known to have thrown with both hands: Tony Mullane in 1882 and in 1893, Elton Chamberlain in 1888, Larry Corcoran in 1884, and George Wheeler.
Greg A. Harris is the only major league pitcher in the modern era to pitch with both his left and his right arm. A natural righty, by 1986 he could throw well enough left-handed that he felt capable of pitching with either arm in a game. Harris did not throw lefty in a regular-season game until September 28, 1995, the penultimate game of his career. Against the Cincinnati Reds in the ninth inning, Harris (then a member of the Montreal Expos) retired Reggie Sanders pitching right-handed, then switched to his left hand for the next two hitters, Hal Morris and Ed Taubensee, who both batted left-handed. Harris walked Morris but got Taubensee to ground out. He then went back to his right hand to retire Bret Boone to end the inning.
Pat Venditte, who played college baseball for the Creighton Bluejays, regularly pitches with both arms. Venditte was drafted by the New York Yankees, and now plays for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders, the Yankees' AAA affiliate. When he opposed switch hitter Ralph Henriquez, Venditte switched his modified glove to his left arm. (Hitters traditionally derive advantages from batting from the opposite side of the plate to the pitcher's throwing arm.) Henriquez then switched to batting left-handed, and a series of changes continued for several minutes. This prompted the PBUC (Professional Baseball Umpires Corporation) to issue rules about switch-pitching: switch-pitchers must choose which way they will begin pitching before they start. Then, batters will select with which hand they will bat. The batter and the pitcher are each allowed one switch during the plate appearance, after the first pitch is thrown.
Right-handed pitcher Yu Darvish throws with his left hand when training. He does this to keep both arms strong and balanced. He does not pitch left-handed during a game, however.
In 2003, the Atlanta Braves drafted switch pitcher Brandon Berdoll of Temple (Texas) Junior College in the 27th round. He never made it to the major leagues.
In the collegiate ranks, Matt Brunnig (Harvard class of 2006-07) was able to pitch over 85 mph left-handed and over 90 mph right-handed, but only pitched with both arms in the same game a few times. In college he pitched more from the right side as a starter and pitched some relief as a lefty although he did start one game left-handed. When playing the outfield after a start he would typically play the position with the other arm to rest the arm he just pitched with.
Switch-throwers are commonly taught to switch-throw at a young age. For instance, Venditte's father trained him in ambidextrous throwing from the age of three and Brunnig's father (a chiropractor) taught him from age five.

Farrukh Quarishi

Farrukh Quraishi (, born November 13, 1951 in Masjid-I-Sulaiman, Iran) is a retired Iranian-born soccer player who was the 1974 Hermann Trophy winner. He spent six seasons in the North American Soccer League playing for the Tampa Bay Rowdies and Calgary Boomers. Since retiring from playing, he has held numerous executive positions in U.S. soccer teams and organizations.
Playing career.
Youth.
Quraishi was born in Iran, but grew up in London, England. In the late 1960s, Francisco Marcos, who later founded the United Soccer Leagues (USL), was an assistant coach at Oneonta State and a fledgling soccer entrepreneur. He had created American International Sports Exchange to coordinate overseas soccer tours for U.S. teams. On one of these trips in 1970, Marcos met Quraishi and convinced him to attend and play soccer at Oneonta State. Over his three years with Oneonta, Quraishi developed into one of the era's best college players. He was a member of the 1972 Oneonta team which lost to SIU-E in the NCAA Division II championship game. That year he was selected to the 1972 State University of New York Conference All Conference team, an honor he repeated in 1973 and 1974. Although the team did not advance as far his junior and senior year, he was showered with accolades, being named a first team All American in 1973 and 1974. He capped this when he was named the 1974 Hermann Trophy winner as the best collegiate player in the nation. Oneonta State inducted Quraishi into its Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999.
Professional.
In 1975, the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League selected Quraishi with the first overall pick in the NASL college draft. That season, despite being a rookie, Quraishi was named to the NASL All Star First Team. However, Quraishi remained committed to his education, which he had not yet finished, and continued to study while playing. In 1976 he graduated from Oneonta with a bachelors degree in sociology. Quraishi struggled with injuries, including a broken leg, which had a severe negative impact on his career. While he played 21 games as a rookie, he never again saw that many games in a season. In 1976 he played fifteen and in 1977 fourteen games. He lost the entire 1978 season due to the broken leg but came back strong in 1979, seeing time in eighteen games. However, injuries again reduced his playing time and he entered only nine games in 1980. He then moved to the expansion Calgary Boomers for whom he played one indoor season, 1980–1981. At the end of the indoor season, he retired from playing professionally and moved back to Tampa.
Administrative career.
Public relations.
While playing with the Rowdies, Quraishi also served as the team’s director of youth development. In this capacity he got his first taste of managing and developing a team’s infrastructure. While the players are the natural focus of any sport, these players are supported by owners, executives, managers, salesmen, etc. Quraishi gained valuable exposure to this side of soccer at an early point in his career and it served him well for the rest of his life. As part of his duties in community relations, Quraishi developed soccer leagues and soccer camps throughout the Tampa Bay area. When he returned to Tampa, Caspers Company, a McDonald’s franchisee, hired him as its director of public relations. As part of his duties, he placed the McDonald’s name and logo into the public’s awareness through charity and youth events. Among these was the establishment of the McDonald's Sun Bowl International Youth Soccer Tournament. He remained with the company until 1992 when he re-entered the soccer world full time as Orlando, Florida’s venue executive director for the 1994 FIFA World Cup.
Tampa Bay Mutiny.
After the World Cup, Quraishi became involved in the establishment of Major League Soccer (MLS). MLS began developing itself prior to its first season in 1996, Quraishi became part of the process of bringing a franchise to Tampa Bay. When MLS created the Tampa Bay Mutiny, it hired Quraishi as the team’s president and general manager. Despite a successful inaugural season, the Mutiny, which was one of three teams directly owned by the league, had one of the lowest average attendances in MLS. Despite winning the Supporter's Shield for having the best regular season record in MLS, winning the Eastern Conference regular season title, producing the league MVP (Carlos Valderrama), scoring champion (Roy Lassiter), rookie of the year (Steve Ralston), coach of the year (Thomas Rongen) and six players named to the MLS All-Star team, Quraishi was fired by then MLS commissioner Doug Logan. Reasons given for Quraishi's firing were poor attendance and the fact that the team's director of finance, Mark Fortunat, was charged with embezzling money from the club. As one of three teams directly owned by the league (the others were San Jose and Dallas), the team's director of finance also reported directly to the finance department at MLS headquarters in Los Angeles. Quraishi was not implicated in the Fortunat incident and was in fact instrumental in Fortunat being convicted of the charges when MLS decided to drop the matter. As a result of Quraishi's firing, Thomas Rongen, the team’s head coach, resigned and moved to the New England Revolution.
United Soccer League.
Despite this disappointment, Quraishi did not leave soccer management, but became a professional sports consultant for two years before moving to Massachusetts in 1998 to join Massachusetts Professional Soccer where he served as executive vice president and chief operating officer, overseeing the management of the Boston Bulldogs, the Cape Cod Crusaders and the Boston Renegades.. Quraishi also worked as a soccer broadcast announcer and worked with Master Coach International, a match and player video analysis company that developed proprietary software. In 2004, he was appointed to the USL Owners Advisory Council.

National Museum of Military History (Luxembourg)

The National Museum of Military History (, ), abbreviated to NMMH, is a national museum in Diekirch, in north-eastern Luxembourg, that includes amongst its exhibits military vehicles and weaponry, a photographic archive, and lifesize dioramas displaying military servicemen and actions. 
Museum.
The museum originally developed out of the Diekirch Historical Museum (opened in 1984), which was primarily dedicated to the Battle of the Bulge in Luxembourg in winter 1944–45. The museum is located in the complex of the Diekirch 'old brewery'.
The main topic of the museum remains the balanced and objective historical representation of the military operations in the Ardennes from the American, German, and civilian points of view. Over 3000 square metres of exhibition space and numerous lifesize dioramas enable an insight of the dramatic and tragic situations that both soldiers and civilians were caught in. Special showrooms feature extensive collections of weapons, uniforms, military equipment of all kind, wheeled and tracked vehicles, in addition to numerous personal soldiers' belongings, photographs, documents, and maps. The museum’s core piece is the detailed mock-up of the night-time Sauer river crossing at Diekirch on January 18, 1945 by units of the United States 5th Infantry Division. The museum's World War II collection is regarded as one of the finest of Western Europe.
A second part of the NMMH museum is dedicated to the history of the military of Luxembourg since the creation of Luxembourg as a state, until present. A number of large-scale dioramas cover key aspects and periods of the Luxembourgian army since the Second World War. Other sections are dedicated to Luxembourgers fighting in allied armies in the First World War, the Second World War, and during the Korean War. United Nations missions in which Luxembourg has participated are also covered and special displays provide an overview of daily military life.
The National Museum of Military History is a founding member of the Belgian-Luxembourg Association of the Museums of the Battle of the Ardennes (AMBA) and a European partner of the National World War II Museum in New Orleans, in the United States.

Ninjabread Man

Ninjabread Man is a platform video game from English developer/publisher Data Design Interactive.
The game was released on the PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows in Europe in July 2005. A port for the Wii was released on September 21, 2007 in Europe, September 27 in Australia, and October 3 in North America. "Ninjabread Man" was published as part of Data Design Interactive's 'Popcorn Arcade' brand of Wii games.
"Ninjabread Man" actually started life as a re-imagining of the Commodore Amiga classic 'Zool: Ninja of the Nth Dimension' which was largely favourably received on its initial release in 1992. Zoo Digital Publishing commissioned DDI to re-imagine Zool as a 3D game for eventual release on PlayStation 2 and Gamecube, however the publisher was unimpressed with the results and canned the project. DDI opted to continue with the game, but changing the theme and character for "Ninjabread Man".
Plot.
According to the back of the box art, Candy Land is under attack by Hordes of snapping cupcakes, angry bees, and jelly monsters that have taken over the land. Ninjabread Man must stop the evil army of monster cakes. The game itself features no cut scenes or dialog, thus leaving the box art and instruction booklet to give the only hints of a story.
Gameplay.
Ninjabread Man is an action-adventure platformer. There are three levels in the game, plus a tutorial level. In order to proceed to the next level, players must collect eight power rods to activate a teleporter. When the player completes a level and plays it again, a menu appears with a second mode available, ‘Score Pickups’. If the level is completed again in this mode, the player will unlock ‘Time Attack’ mode. Completion of this mode unlocks the ‘Hidden Pickups!’ alternative mode. Several comic attacks appear in the game, such as the Samurai Sword attack that reduces enemies to jam.
Reception.
"Ninjabread Man" received unanimously negative reviews upon release. The PlayStation 2 version of the game has a 31% average rating on GameRankings, while the Wii version has an average of 17.5%. On Metacritic, the Wii version of the game has an average score of 20/100, based on 6 reviews. The PC version of the game was not reviewed by any major publication. Despite the negative reception of the first game, on January 23, 2008, a sequel titled "Ninjabread Man II: Blades of Fury" was announced.
IGN gave the Wii version a score of 1.5/10, saying: "Is Ninjabread Man actually a good game? No chance. It’s buggy, often completely broken, somehow manages to have frame issues in tiny levels, and is completely ruthless if (and when) younger players die." Thunderbolt gave it 1/10, citing the game's length and the unimaginative use of the character as key flaws, "Ninjabread Man could be a cool guy with a bad attitude, in a stark and ironic contrast to his surroundings. He could be the Jack Bauer of the bakery, but instead our hero is silent and lifeless."
ScrewAttack made it a SAGY nominee for "Worst Multiplatform Game of 2007", blaming the quality assurance testers for not pointing out the flaws.
Sequel.
Despite the negative reception of the first game, on January 23, 2008, a sequel titled "Ninjabread Man II: Blades of Fury" was announced. Not much information nor a release date had been issued. But it had been revealed that Data Design had created a website asking for the fans of the game to give ideas for the sequel. It is likely the sequel will never be developed due to Data Design ceasing development in 2009.

<doc id="9768276" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9768276" title="United States v. Stanley">
United States v. Stanley

United States v. Stanley, , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a serviceman could not file a tort action against the federal government, even though the government secretly administered doses of LSD to the serviceman as part of an experimental program, because his injuries were found by the lower court to be service-related.
Background.
In February 1958, James B. Stanley, a master sergeant in the Army stationed at Fort Knox, Kentucky, volunteered for a chemical warfare testing program. Stanley was administered lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in a US Army plan to test the effects of the drug on human subjects. Stanley claimed he was unknowingly given the drug.
Stanley claimed that as a result of the LSD exposure, he suffered from hallucinations, periods of incoherence, and memory loss due to his unawareness of having taken the drug. He suffered severe personality changes that led to his discharge and the dissolution of his marriage.
Stanley filed a lawsuit under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) alleging negligence in the administration, supervision, and subsequent monitoring of the experimental program. 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that the serviceman could assert his claims under the FTCA and refused to dismiss the serviceman's Bivens claims. 
Opinion of the Court.
After granting certiorari, the Supreme Court held that the circuit court had no jurisdiction to give orders to dismiss FTCA claims. The Supreme Court also held there was no Bivens claim for the serviceman's injuries because the lower court ruled the injuries occurred during Stanley's military service.
Aftermath.
In 1994 Congress passed a private claims bill to redress the case. In 1996 an arbitration panel awarded Stanley $400,577 (the maximum amount allowed under the bill) after a 2-1 vote.

South Carolina on My Mind

South Carolina On My Mind is a song written and recorded by native South Carolinians Hank Martin and Buzz Arledge. It was adopted by South Carolina as a second state song1 on March 8, 1984.2 It joins "Carolina," which has been a state song since 1911.
Resolution Adopting the Song.
First proposed on May 12, 1983, the bill's preambles explain the rationale for a second state song:
AN ACT TO DESIGNATE "SOUTH CAROLINA ON MY MIND" AS AN OFFICIAL STATE SONG.
Whereas, a beautiful inspiring ballad entitled "South Carolina On My Mind" has been created, sung, and recorded by Hank Martin and Buzz Arledge, both native South Carolinians who are now professional musicians in Nashville and New York; and
Whereas, the South Carolina Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism provided initial encouragement to Hank and Buzz and introduced "South Carolina On My Mind" in a record distributed to radio stations and in other advertising and promotion materials used extensively by television and other media; and
Whereas, Hank and Buzz have used their own resources to produce a "South Carolina On My Mind" album that features the South Carolina ballad and ten other songs recorded by these talented musicians; and
Whereas, the three most prestigious national music publications have promoted "South Carolina On My Mind", resulting in widespread usage of the song by radio stations across the nation; and
Whereas, Hank and Buzz have scheduled personal appearances to sing the song at several South Carolina Governor's Conferences, the half time show of a University of South Carolina football game, the Pendleton Spring Jubilee, and other major events; and
Whereas, many South Carolina organizations have used "South Carolina On My Mind" as a theme song at national conventions and other programs, and the University of South Carolina basketball team, the Lancaster Rhythm, the Conway CART, and other organizations are using the song for entertainment and promotional purposes; and
Whereas, "South Carolina On My Mind" has penetrated the hearts of countless numbers of Americans and residents of other nations who have heard Hank and Buzz sing this ballad; and
Whereas, millions of these people have become favorably impressed with South Carolina as a direct result of their exposure to the song, and many of them now have "South Carolina on Their Mind" and are coming to our State as vacationers and potential future residents. Now, therefore,
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of South Carolina:
Official state song designated
SECTION 1. "South Carolina On My Mind" is designated as an official state song to help inspire pride in our State and improve the quality of life among all South Carolinians, and to promote the image of South Carolina beyond our borders by further developing tourism and industry through the attraction of vacationers, prospective investors, and new residents.
Time effective
SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon approval by the Governor.
Lyrics.
At the foot hills of the Appalachian chain,
Down through the rivers, to the coastal plain,
There's a place that I call home,
And I'll never be alone,
Singin' this Carolina love song
I've got South Carolina on my mind
Remembering all those sunshine Summertimes,
And the beauty of the Autumn when the leaves turn to gold
Touches my heart and thrills my soul to have South Carolina on my mind,
With those clean snow-covered mountain Wintertimes
And the white sands of the beaches and those Carolina peaches,
I've got South Carolina on my mind. 
I'm grown now with a family of my own
In a place that all my kids are callin' home.
And I love this life I'm livin',
And thank God for all He's givin',
and my heart sings this Carolina love song 
I've got South Carolina on my mind
Remembering all those sunshine Summertimes,
And the beauty of the Autumn when the leaves turn to gold
Touches my heart and thrills my soul to have South Carolina on my mind,
With those clean snow-covered mountain Wintertimes
And the white sand of the beaches and those Carolina peaches,
I've got South Carolina on my mind
I've got South Carolina on my mind
I've got South Carolina
On my mind

Rusty tinamou

The rusty tinamou or short-billed tinamou ("Crypturellus brevirostris") is a type of tinamou commonly found in swamp forest in tropical regions of South America.
Taxonomy.
The rusty tinamou is a monotypic species. All tinamou are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.
Etymology.
"Crypturellus" is formed from three Latin or Greek words. "kruptos" meaning covered or hidden, "oura" meaning tail, and "ellus" meaning diminutive. Therefore "Crypturellus" means small hidden tail.
Range and habitat.
It is found in tropical swamp forests and lowland forests, up to altitude. This species is native to northeastern and northwestern Brazil, French Guiana, and eastern Peru in South America.
Description.
The rusty tinamou is in length. Its upper parts are rufous boldly barred with black, its throat is white, its breast is bright rufous, its belly is white, and its flanks are barred black. Its crown is chestnut in color with legs that are yellowish-grey.
Behavior.
Like other tinamous, the rusty tinamou eats fruit off the ground or low-lying bushes. They also eat small amounts of invertebrates, flower buds, tender leaves, seeds, and roots. The male incubates the eggs which may come from as many as 4 different females, and then will raise them until they are ready to be on their own, usually 2–3 weeks. The nest is located on the ground in dense brush or between raised root buttresses.

Semitic Museum

The Harvard Semitic Museum was founded in 1889, and moved into its present location at 6 Divinity Avenue in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1903.
From the beginning, it was the home of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, a departmental library, a repository for research collections, a public educational institute, and a center for archaeological exploration. Among the Museum's early achievements were the first scientific excavations in the Holy Land (at Samaria in 1907-1912) and excavations at Nuzi and Tell el-Khaleifeh in the Sinai, where the earliest alphabet was found.
The Museum's artifacts include pottery, cylinder seals, sculpture, coins, cuneiform tablets, and Egyptian mummy sarcophagi. Many are from museum-sponsored excavations in Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, Cyprus, Israel, and Tunisia. The museum holds plaster casts of the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III, the Laws of Hammurabi, and the Stele of Esarhaddon, as well as a full-scale model of an Iron Age Israelite house. The Museum is dedicated to the use of these collections for the teaching, research, and publication of Near Eastern archaeology, history, and culture.
History of the Semitic Museum.
Architectural firm A. W. Longfellow broke ground on the present Semitic Museum site on September 27, 1900. Construction was completed in Spring of 1902, and the public portions of the Museum were opened on February 5, 1903. The Museum's facilities were repurposed during World War II, and it was closed to the public from August 1942 through April 1946. It would close again twelve years later in 1958. The Museum reopened on April 5, 1982, and then Harvard President Derek Bok spoke at the reopening ceremony.
Exhibition and Education.
The Museum, through the collaborative efforts of departmental faculty, curators, museum curatorial staff and students, mounts exhibits, often in conjunction with university courses, which not only serve the University community, but also attract the general public. The Museum has an active public outreach program featuring tours for school groups and teacher training workshops. The Museum also sponsors, either alone or in conjunction with other institutions, a number of public lectures each year. Through these educational efforts, the Museum seeks to promote a wider understanding of the civilizations of the Near East and their great cultural legacies.
Teaching with the Collection.
There are many opportunities for Harvard University students and faculty to make use of the museum collections and facilities. Objects can be used for coursework, viewing assignments, research papers, senior theses, dissertations, and teaching displays. The basement seminar room is available for sections scheduled to view the collection.
Research and Publication.
The Semitic Museum sponsors archaeological field research into the complex societies of the Near East, with special emphasis on those ancient cultures related to the world of the Bible. Each year more than 100 staff, students, and volunteers participate in the Ashkelon Excavations (The Leon Levy Expedition), led by Museum Director and Dorot Professor of the Archaeology of Israel Lawrence E. Stager. The Museum, through its Harvard Semitic Series and Harvard Semitic Monographs, publishes archaeological, historical, philological, and cultural studies of the Near East, many of which present the research of the department faculty and their students.

Danaea

Danaea Sm. is a fern genus of approximately 50 species in the eusporangiate fern family Marattiaceae.
they are small to intermediately large ferns with erect or creeping rhizomes and usually once pinnate leaves with opposite pinnae. The fertile leaves are contracted, acrostichoid and covered below with sunken, linear synangia. The genus "Danaea" has a Neotropical distribution, occurring from southern Mexico through Central America, the Caribbean and northern South America to Bolivia, Paraguay and the Mata Atlantica in Brazil and Northern Argentina. There is also a population on Isla del Coco (Cocos Island) in the Pacific.
Two species "Danaea carillensis" (Costa Rica) and "D. simplicifolia" (Guianas, Brazil, Trinidad) have simple, undivided leaves, and some other species sometimes have bipinnate leaves ("D. bipinnata, D. nodosa, D. urbanii"). 
One species "Danaea kalevala" of the Lesser Antilles was named in honour of the Finnish heroic epic Kalevala.
The basal chromosome number for this genus is "2n=80". The type species is "Danaea nodosa".
Classification.
"Danaea" is the basal lineage in the Marattiaceae and the oldest fossils are from the Paleocene, a period where rainforests became more abundant. It has radiated in these early rainforests and presently counts about 50 species in 3 sections: sect. "Danaea", sect. "Arthrodanaea" and sect. "Holodanaea".

Witley Park

Witley Park was a 19th-century house and estate in Surrey, between Godalming and Haslemere.
History.
The estate named Lea Park between Godalming and Haslemere, Surrey, and the adjacent South Park Farm were purchased in 1890 from the Earl of Derby; the title to the estate included the titular Lordship of the Manor and control of Hindhead Common. Lea Park was developed by J. Whitaker Wright, as part of extensive land – approximately – that he purchased in the Haslemere and Hindhead area.
The preexisting house was developed into a 32 bedroom mansion, adjacent to artificial lakes and landscaped grounds. Beside three lakes, Whitaker Wright built an underground conservatory/smoking room, with aquarium windows.
Whitaker Wright committed suicide and his lands were auctioned, with much of Hindhead Common, Witley Common and Thursley Common passing into the hands of the National Trust.
Lea Park was sold to Lord Pirrie, notable for his role in the building of RMS "Titanic". The letter P with a crown above can be seen on metal gates in the estate and previously-owned lands.
The estate was renamed Witley Park by later owners the Leigh family, perhaps to avoid the confusion with Lea.
Present.
The Witley Park mansion burned down in 1952 and 'Witley Park House', a Modern movement home designed by Patrick Gwynne, but the houses and park are private and not open to the public.

Black Butte (Siskiyou County, California)

Black Butte is a cluster of overlapping dacite lava domes in a butte,
a parasitic satellite cone of Mount Shasta. It is located directly adjacent to Interstate 5 at milepost 742 between the city of Mount Shasta and Weed, California. The highway crosses a pass, Black Butte Summit, at the western base of the lava domes. The lava domes were extruded at the foot of the cone of Shastina following the period of its major eruptions about 9,000–10,000 years ago.
A United States Forest Service fire lookout tower was built on the summit in the 1930s, but destroyed during the Columbus Day Storm of 1962. A new lookout was built in 1963 and operated until 1973. The building was moved by helicopter to a new location in 1975 and only the concrete foundation remains today. A long trail leads to the summit from a trailhead accessible by dirt roads off the Everitt Memorial Highway.
The summit boasts an outstanding view of the southwest side of Shasta and Shastina, and on clear days Mount McLoughlin is easily visible to the north in Oregon.

The Newe people and Newe Sogobia have been referred to as "the most bombed people on Earth" and "the most bombed place on Earth" as the United States Government has exploded more than 1,000 nuclear weapons at the Nevada Test Site, which is located on Western Shoshone land. The government has dumped highly radioactive nuclear waste there.
"The food that my people survived on is not here no more on account of this nuclear weapon that we have developed," Harney explains. "The pine nuts aren't here no more, the chokecherries aren't here, the antelope aren't here, the deer aren't here, the groundhog aren't here, the sagehen aren't here."
Sometimes called "The hardest working man in shamanism", Harney, for many years, spent most of his time travelling around the world spreading a message about the dangers of nuclear energy and the problems facing our Mother Earth. "The Mother Earth provides us with food, provides us with air, provides us with water. We, the people, are going to have to put our thoughts together, to save our planet here. We've only got one water, one air, one Mother Earth." Among other excursions, he visited mutated children in Kazakhstan hospitals who lived close to the Russian nuclear test 
site. He received the 2003 International Nuclear Free Future Solutions award.
Harney's formal education ended when he ran away from Indian boarding school at the age of nine because of his feelings of how his schoolmates were mistreated by their teachers. However, he was able to talk to students, government officials, and members of the public about toxins of all kinds: chemicals from mining and industry, and, worst of all, nuclear fallout and radiation poisoning from nuclear testing, nuclear waste storage, and nuclear waste transportation that takes place over regular railroads and highways.
He spoke out about the contamination of our water and shared with people a vision that he experienced several years ago. "I was praying to the water and the spirit of the water told me, 'Pretty soon, I'm going to look like clean water, but no one is going to use me'. I didn't really understand what I was told until I went to Kazakhstan in Russia. Kazakhstan is where Russia tested nuclear bombs for many years. Over there I saw water that looks like clean water, but people can't drink it because it is contaminated with radiation ... he nature put all the living things here for us to take care of, not to destroy them, but to work with them so that we may live with them for many more years."
Harney stated a firm belief in communication with the natural elements and all living things and numerous other people have witnessed the results of his work, including rain in drought areas, dry springs which started flowing once more, plants flourishing where they were sparse before and the return of animals that had not been seen in their native habitats for many years .
"We have to come back to the Native way of life. The Native way is to pray for everything. Our Mother Earth is very important. Everything survives on our Mother, the only Mother we've got. We can't just misuse her and think she's going to continue. Let's not destroy the Mother Earth. Let's take care of her and she will take care of us."
Shortly before his death, Harney completed arrangements for the publication of his second book, “The Nature Way”, in which he shares the traditional knowledge that his people, the Newe, have followed since time immemorial. In 1994 he founded the Shundahai Network ("shundahai" translates to "peace and harmony with all creation") where he remained as board chair until his death. He was also the founder and director of Poo Ha Bah, a traditional healing center in Tecopa, California.
"I have established Poo-Ha-Bah for all the people. Poo-Ha-Bah in my language is a very important word--it’s talking about Doctor Water. It’s really important to have healing water here, not only as a human--a lot of animal life have used healing water, a lot of different ways. My people have always traveled for many miles to get into different kinds of healing waters. This is something that we all need, and this is one reason I have looked for healing water and I finally found one in Tecopa, California. I am pretty sure that we all will enjoy the healing water if we ask the healing water to help us with our illness of all different kinds. This is something that our people have talked about for many, many years."
Harney was a proponent of universal inclusion and individual spiritual empowerment, “We need your help. Who ever you are, whatever color you are, wherever you come from on this Mother Earth of ours. We’ve only got this one Earth and we all have to take care of it. So I am asking all of you people throughout the world to unite yourselves together. Give us a helping hand so we can take care of all the living things.”
Harney's experiences with victims of the nuclear industry throughout the world, and particularly the "Downwinders" of the Western United States, along with the powerful message he carried of peace and respect for our planet, lent unique credibility to his words. Typical of his international work was acting as keynote speaker at the Atomic and Hydrogen Bomb Conference, in 2001, in Nagasaki, Japan, where he was able to speak with other still-recovering survivors of nuclear war .
Trained from childhood in the traditional Newe ways of medicine and spirituality (the two are not viewed separately), Harney noted the extinction of medicinal plants due to the toxins of mining, and the disappearance of many birds and other animals that once roamed the Newe homelands. Beginning in 1957, he worked with medicine women of Battle Mountain, Nevada, running the Sundance Ceremony and sweat lodges as well as helping sick people. As a medicine person, he also worked steadily to preserve and protect the sacred sites and burial grounds of his people. He was raised to view all life as sacred. "Everything is alive and has a spirit to it. The rocks, the mountains, streams, animals, plants, birds, oceans, and so forth," he says.
Harney warned of a quickly approaching time when the Earth is so contaminated by the results of human activity that all the water on the planet will be toxic to all forms of life. His vision, however, was not fatalistic. He remained convinced that humans have the power to turn things around, saying "The water has a life, and we have to pray for it. All the water that comes from the Mother Earth, that's her blood.".
Harney affirmed that healing and well-being are everyone's business, and that no one is powerless. "Yes, you can. All of us are gifted. We just need to open up the gifts by praying in our own way, singing our own songs and talking to everything out there with love and respect. Don't feel foolish. This is how everything has been sustained for millions of years. This will open up a totally new world for you. Amazing things will happen if you are patient. This is how we will heal ourselves and our Mother Earth."
He died of cancer which had metastasized into his bones.

Since her historic performance in 1967, Shuli Natan has performed for countless audiences, in Israel and worldwide. Her unique voice holds the listeners in its spell, and every performance turns into a spontaneous sing-along.
In her 1999 CD "Open Roads" she included her versions of songs which are popular in Israel today, such as David D'Or's "Watch Over Us, Child" and Rami Kleinstein's hit, "Never-Ending Miracles."
Natan accompanies herself on the guitar, as she sings Israeli songs, folk songs from around the world, Hassidic and Yiddish songs and songs of the Oriental Jewish community. Natan sings in different languages including Hebrew, English, French, Ladino and Spanish.

Moon face

Moon facies, or moon face, is a medical sign which people are often born with, resulting in a large chin and large forehead. This results in a 'moon' shape, when looked at from the side.
It is often associated with Cushing's syndrome or steroid treatment (especially corticosteroids), which has led to it being known as Cushingoid facies ("Cushings-like face").

Mary Bateman

Mary Bateman (1768 – 20 March 1809) was an English criminal and alleged witch, known as the "Yorkshire Witch", who was tried and executed for murder during the early 19th century.
Born to a farmer in Asenby, North Yorkshire, she became a servant girl in Thirsk, North Yorkshire but was eventually released due to petty theft. During the 1780s, she became a minor thief and con artist who often convinced many of her victims she possessed supernatural powers. By the end of the century, she had become a prominent fortuneteller in Leeds who prescribed potions which she claimed would ward off evil spirits as well as acting as medicine.
In 1806, Bateman was approached by William and Rebecca Perigo who believed they had been put under a spell after Rebecca had complained of chest pains and asked for her help in lifting the curse. However, over the next several months, Bateman began feeding them pudding which was laced with poison. While Rebecca regularly ate the pudding, her husband was unable to eat more than a spoonful. Rebecca's condition worsened however and she finally died in May 1806. William Perigo continued to pay her for more than two years until he discovered one of the "charms" which he and his wife had received from Bateman was worthless paper; he went to the authorities who arrested Bateman the following day after William lured her to a meeting.
Although she proclaimed her innocence, a search of her home turned up poison as well as many personal belongings of her victims including the Perigo couple. In March 1809, she was tried in York and found guilty by a jury of fraud and murder. Sentenced to death, Bateman attempted to avoid her execution by claiming she was pregnant, but a physical examination disproved this. She was finally hanged alongside two men on 20 March 1809. After her execution, her body was put on public display with strips of her skin being sold as magic charm to ward off evil spirits.
Bateman's skeleton is on display to the public at Thackray Museum in Leeds.

<doc id="9768610" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9768610" title="Open Russian Festival of Animated Film">
Open Russian Festival of Animated Film

The Open Russian Festival of Animated Film () is an annual animation film festival held in Suzdal, Russia. It is the only festival devoted to professional appraisal of domestic Russian animation. The festival takes place in late winter or early spring (in 2007 it was on the first five days of March) and accepts only animated films from the Russian Federation and (after a 1999 referendum) from Belarus made in the last three years.
Alongside the in-contest and general film screenings, the festival organizes round-table talk sessions, press conferences, master classes and presentations.
History.
The festival was first held in 1996 at a boarding house called "Birch Grove" near the town of Tarusa. Because of the extreme scarcity of Russian animation in the post-perestroika era, submissions from the last three years were accepted. Along with auteur films, commercial reels, video clips and television bumpers were allowed.
The prizes were handed out according to profession, and any member or guest of the festival was able to vote for their favourite film. The three leading winners were given wooden planks hewn by founder and president Aleksandr Tatarskiy and signed by their colleagues. In addition to the festival, the location offered fresh air, skiing, and nearby historic sites. The festival in general was noted for its laid-back nature and served as a gathering for animators who otherwise had few opportunities to see each other in an era after the break-up of Soyuzmultfilm. Andrey Khrzhanovskiy says that it was a partial replacement for the Soviet tradition of having yearly screenings and discussions of all films from all studios at the Cinematographer's Union (which was open to the best film critics of the country). The tradition stopped in the 1990s, leaving all studios (animation studios included) with no way to connect.
For the first number of years, the festival did not have an official name and was known simply as "Tarusoy" (Тарусой).
In 2002, the festival changed its location to Suzdal's tourist centre, where it is held to this day. The jury situation also changed, and since 2006 films have been judged by a panel of 33 respected Russian animation professionals representing many varied professions in the art. 2008 was the first festival held after the death of Aleksandr Tatarskiy, who had headed all the previous festivals. The artistic director in his place was Aleksandr Gerasimov.
Prizes.
Historically, the prizes have varied in different years; on some years the jury decided to not give out a Grand Prix and other years featured specific awards tailor-made to the films which were in the competition. In 2007, the prizes were: Grand Prix (also 2nd and 3rd place), Best Direction, Best Dramaturgy, Best Visuals, Best Animation, Best Sound, Best Student Film, Best Interstitial Animation and Best Film for Children.
Additionally, before 2009, the festival allowed internet users of Rambler Vision to see the films first and vote for their favourites. The Prize of Audience Sympathies was awarded at the closing ceremony.

Gerard Mortier

Gerard Alfons August Mortier (since 2007 Baron Mortier) (25 November 1943 – 8 March 2014) was a Belgian opera director and administrator of Flemish origin, born in Ghent.
Career.
Mortier studied law and journalism at Ghent University. He then pursued apprenticeships in opera administration under Christoph von Dohnányi in Frankfurt and Rolf Liebermann in Paris. He served as the general director of La Monnaie (De Munt), Brussels (1981–91) and the Salzburg Festival (1990–2001). He was a founding director of the Ruhr Triennale arts festival in Germany, and then he became general director of the Opéra National de Paris in 2004. He relinquished this post in 2009.
In February 2007, the New York City Opera (NYCO) named him their next general director, effective as of the 2009/2010 season. Mortier assisted with company operations from Paris during the interim period after his appointment was announced. Problems with fund-raising and a smaller-than-expected budget began to develop during the interim period after Mortier's appointment. At one point, there was controversy during this time over speculation that Mortier was campaigning for a position as co-artistic director of the Bayreuth Festival. Also in 2007, King Albert II conferred the title of Baron in the nobility of Belgium on him.
In November 2008, by mutual agreement, Mortier and the NYCO agreed to terminate their contract, and that he would not become NYCO's general director. Later that month, Mortier accepted the position of Artistic Director of the Teatro Real.
In September 2013, he announced he was battling cancer and urged the Spanish government not to appoint a Spaniard as his successor. The following week he was fired, to be replaced by Joan Matabosch, of the Liceu in Barcelona. On 26 September 2013, Mortier was named Artistic Advisor of the Teatro Real
In April 2014, he was awarded the "Lifetime Achievement Award" in the International Opera Awards 2014.
Personal life.
After the early death of his mother Mortier was sent to a Jesuit boarding school.
Outed in the Flemish press in the 1980s, Mortier preferred to keep a low profile on his homosexuality.
Death.
Mortier died of pancreatic cancer in Brussels on 8 March 2014, aged 70.

Duddo

Duddo is a village and civil parish in Northumberland, about southwest of Berwick on Tweed.
History.
Duddo Five Stones is a stone circle to the north of the village. It is a Scheduled Monument.
Duddo Tower, south of the village, was built late in the 16th century. It is now a ruin and a Scheduled Monument. It replaced an earlier tower built in 1496.
Churches and school.
The Church of England parish church of All Saints is a Gothic Revival building. It is in a Decorated Gothic style and was completed in 1879.
All Saints' church replaced the earlier parish church of St James the Great, which was designed by Ignatius Bonomi in a neo-Norman style and built in 1832. It was later converted into part of the parish school, presumably when All Saints' church was built. The school has since closed and the building is now a private house.

WDBO (AM)

WDBO (580 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a sports radio format. Licensed to Orlando, Florida, USA, the station is owned by Cox Radio. Its studios are located in Orlando and the transmitter tower is in Lockhart.
History.
WDBO was originally part of a cluster of AM, FM and TV stations all with the same callsign. In 1982, the company that owned all three at the time, The Outlet Company, sold the radio stations to Katz Broadcasting. The TV station eventually became WKMG. When the stations were sold, WDBO-FM was re-formatted as a country music station, K92FM, with the call letters WWKA.
WDBO-AM, at the time 58 WDBO, strayed from its original middle-of-the-road music format, joining ABC News Radio, and slowly adding more and more talk radio programs. By the 1990s, it had become NewsTalk 580 WDBO, which for years has been Greater Orlando's highest-rated AM news/talk station. In August 2011, Cox Communications took down its rock station, WHTQ, and gave it the callsign WDBO-FM, and became a simulcast of WDBO-AM. WDBO-AM was initially simulcast on that station's HD2 channel beginning in late February 2008. The news/talk station eventually re-branded with the FM frequency, NewsTalk 96-5 WDBO.
On November 12, 2012, WDBO-AM ceased airing what had become the WDBO-FM feed, and re-launched as a sports talk radio station affiliated with ESPN Radio. That network had been dropped previously by WHOO, which chose to affiliate with NBC Sports Radio. It carries the full ESPN Radio schedule, save for a local program weekdays from 4-6pm hosted by Scott Anez.
WDBO-AM has remained the radio home of the Orlando Magic even with the format change.

<doc id="9768691" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9768691" title="Taipei People">
Taipei People

Taipei People () is a collection of 14 short stories written by Pai Hsien-yung in the 1960s, published in 1971. The length and art of each story is different, but all these short stories are about people who came from Mainland China to Taiwan in the 1950s, and about their life in Taipei. Some of the stories were also published in Wandering in the Garden, Waking from a Dream (1968).
Context.
"Taipei People" is the iconic literary work reflecting the experience of people from Mainland China ("mainlanders") who fled to Taiwan following the War of Resistance against Japan and the Chinese Civil War and founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.
Structure and Format.
The format and topic of this book is often compared to James Joyce's "Dubliners". Both of the books are short story series, and they are all about people in a certain city. Also, another book of Pai Hsien-yung called "New Yorkers" are similar to the two books.
Themes.
Although these people are called "Taipei People", in their minds they are always reminiscing the scintillating old times in Mainland China, therefore most of them don't really belong to Taipei mentally. Their loss and their sense of insecurity is what this book is depicting.
Motifs.
The stories are interwoven with a large number of motifs that are very suggestive of the place, the time, and the people. Some of them include dance halls, teahouses, taxi dancer, and (sexual) patronage; mahjong; the Kuomintang military, especially the officer corps; China's diverse regions; fashion, especially the chipao (qipao); traditional Chinese interior furnishings; Buddhism; Peking opera; separation; and many others.
Related works.
The collection has been translated into English and other languages. The stories have been also reworked to dramas in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and a movie in Taiwan.
Short stories synopses.
""Taipei People"" consists of fourteen stories:
Brief synopses are provided below. (Based on the English translation by the author and Patia Yasin, published as "Wandering in the Garden, Waking from a Dream.")
The Eternal Snow Beauty (永遠的尹雪豔).
The aging "Snow Beauty" (Yin Hsueh-yen) looks back on her days as the belle of Shanghai's Paramount ballroom; she is still the center of attention at upscale mahjong soirees she arranges at her Taipei home.
A Touch of Green (一把青).
In an extended tale, the (female) narrator observes how an innocent middle school bride (Verdancy Chu) transcends the death of her air force pilot husband during the war years to attain some degree of stability in the post-war Taiwan environment.
The story touches on the KMT-related New Life Movement as an element of continuity in the social life of mainland loyalists in the pre- and post-war eras.
New Year's Eve (歲除).
A visit by a former commanding officer (Brother Lai) for some New Year's Eve dining and drinking provides a contrast between the heroic tales of past military exploits and the limitations of his current situation.
An important "character" in the story is the fiery Kaoliang liquor, famous in Taiwan for its power.
The Last Night of Taipan Chin (金大班的最後一夜).
"Taipan Chin" is actually a woman who commands a taxi dancer group. In the story, she reflects on her choices, especially the insurmountable contradictions between wealth/security vs. love vs. freedom.
A Sea of Blood-red Azaleas (那片血一般紅的杜鵑花).
A servant, Wang Hsiung, epitomizes the torment of exile. The story is pervaded with "fish out of water" symbolism.
The story leans heavily on the use of the azalea as a symbol of homesickness and exile in Chinese culture.
Ode to Bygone Days (思舊賦).
Two old servants meet and talk about all the changes around them, especially those occurring in the rich family they have served. The story views decay as seen from beneath.
The story falls in a genre that explores the equivalence of the "mansion" and the "family," and the interweaving threads in their parallel growth and decline, in (modern) Chinese literature. See, for instance, Ba Jin's Family and the classic of late imperial Chinese literature, Dream of the Red Chamber.
The Dirge of Liang Fu (梁父吟).
On the occasion of the funeral of a general, one of his cohorts recounts past exploits. The story conveys the utter resolution of substantial elements of the elite mainlander class to "recover the Mainland," even as age and distance render their desires impossible.
The story includes a recounting of events connected to the Wuchang Uprising, the first event in the 1911 Revolution that gave birth to the Republic of China.
"The Dirge of Liang Fu" refers to specific compositions in classic Chinese literature, and suggests the way in which exile and return have been the subject of Chinese poets such as Tu Fu.
Love's Lone Flower (孤戀花).
"Peach Blossom" is the protégé and companion of the female protagonist; both are club escorts. Peach Blossom becomes falls into a deadly and insanity-creating spiral with a thug, Yama.
The context of the story is yet another variant of the Chinese "pleasure quarters," the winehouse.
Glory's by Blossom Bridge (花橋榮記).
"Glory's" is a restaurant, and the noodles it serves could stand as a tenuous link between distant Kweilin—the site of its predecessor—and Taiwan.
All of the stories in the collection make use of allusions to particular regions in mainland China; this story's allusion to Kweilin is special, since that is the author's home province, Kweilin (Guilin). Through references to food, landscape, and the unique Kweilin opera, he suggests the particular poignancy of exile from that place.
Autumn Reveries (秋思).
Autumn means "aging," and this jewel of a story focuses on the power and fragility of beauty.
The story alludes to the use of the chrysanthemum as a symbol of the transience of life—its brilliant, brief flowering followed by excruciating decline—in Chinese (and Japanese) culture.
A Sky Full of Bright, Twinkling Stars (滿天裏亮晶晶的星星).
Capturing a "beat" sensibility that finds extended development in much Taiwan literature, this story about (gay) street characters who frequent Taipei's New Park—The Guru, Ah Hsiung the Primitive, Dark-and-Handsome, Little Jade—concludes with a potent symbol of how very different people (and peoples) are thrown into each other's arms.
This story alludes to the bright effluorescence of the in the '20s and '30s.
Wandering in the Garden, Waking from a Dream (遊園驚夢).
The collection's eponymous story is a tour-de-force of Chinese cultural allusion, as it contrasts the pre-Taiwan condition of a group of taxi dancers (Fragrant Cassia, Heavenly Pepper, Red Red Rose) with their current position as wives (or ex-wives or widows) of prominent society figures (Madan Ch'ien . . . Madam Tou . . . Madam Jen . . . . ).
The story interweaves abundant allusion to a specific variety of Chinese opera called Kunqu in general, including its many roles and unique sounds, together with a specific episode from the opera The Peony Pavilion ("Wandering in the Garden, Waking from a Dream"). Moreover, these are interwoven with allusions to the dashing and machismo of the Kuomintang officer corps and a whole host of allusions to the sensuous pleasures of elite Chinese societies - the shimmer of silk cheongsam, the smell of high quality rosewood Chinese furniture, the taste of dishes from Chinese cuisine specially selected for the event.
Kunqu is itself native to the area near Nanjing and Suzhou in China, in other words, it refers to the seat of Kuomintang government and support prior to exile in Taiwan. The story alludes to specific dishes of the Huaiyang cuisine, another reminder of the Nanjing area.
Winter Night (冬夜).
In a richly ironic tale, two professors talk about their careers, and the contrast between their glorious and idealistic student days—particularly their role in the student demonstrations that ushered in the May Fourth Movement -- and the feelings of failure, hypocrisy, and desertion that they currently battle.
State Funeral (國葬).
This story takes a none-too-subtle parting shot at the Mainlander ethos. At a state funeral for an important general such as his father, the general's old aide is bewildered to confront the old and feeble men who once constituted China's "Steel Army" and "Iron Forces." The only connection to the old Mainland idea seems to be the long line of black limousines, "like a serpent," in the funeral procession.
This story, written about 7 years before the death of Chiang Kai-shek seems to foretell the inevitable consequences of the natural death of the KMT's military leaders.

David Kranzler

David Kranzler (May 19, 1930 – November 7, 2007) was a researcher and historian specializing in those who aided Jews during the Holocaust.
Biography.
Kranzler was born in Germany. His family fled the Nazis to the United States in 1937 when he was a child, and he was raised in New York. He studied for a BA (1953) and an MA (1958) at Brooklyn College, for an M.L.S. degree (1957) at Columbia University, and for his doctorate (1971) at Yeshiva University. He joined the faculty of Queensborough Community College of the City University of New York (CUNY) in 1969, and was a Professor there until his retirement.
He was a leading historian on the subject of aiding the Jews during the Holocaust, a field which his works founded. He was among the first to document the activities of Orthodox Jewish organizations, such as the Vaad Ha-hatzala and Agudath Israel. Historian Alex Grobman referred to Kranzler as "the pioneer of research on Orthodox Jewry during the war." He also researched and created awareness for the mid-1944 Swiss grassroots protests triggered by George Mantello publicizing Rabbi Michael Ber Weissmandl's translation of the Vrba-Wetzler report. Kranzler was convinced that these actions led to stopping of the transports from Hungary in mid-1944 and enabled the Raoul Wallenberg mission and other important initiatives in Budapest.
Kranzler was a contributor to the Goldberg Commission Report on the Role of American Jews During the Holocaust, and submitted two chapters, one on the Orthodox, called "Orthodox Ends, UnOrthodox Means" and another on the Jewish Labor Committee. He served as Scholar-in-Residence in numerous congregations, on college campuses, and centers, including the Spanish-Portuguese Synagogue (Rabbi Marc Angel) in Manhattan, and Kodima Synagogue, Springfield, Mass. (Rabbi Alex Weisfogel), Ohio State University Holocaust Center (Prof. Saul Friedman) and was given a fellowship at Yad Vashem.
Kranzler researched the aid of Jews during the Holocaust for about 35 years. He published ten books and many articles on the subject, and lectured on the subject in America, Israel, Europe and the Far East. He interviewed over a thousand people, including some of the major participants such as Hillel Kook also known as Peter Bergson, George Mantello, Rabbi Solomon Schonfeld and close family and associates of participants no longer alive, including Rabbi Michael Ber Weissmandl and Recha Sternbuch. He established one of the largest and unique research archives on the subject.

Small-billed tinamou

The Small-billed tinamou ("Crypturellus parvirostris") is a type of Tinamou commonly found in dry savanna in Amazonian South America.
Description.
The small-billed tinamou is approximately in length. Its upperparts are dark brown, with grey to brownish under parts and head. Its bill and legs are red.
Taxonomy.
The small-billed tinamou is a monotypic species. All tinamou are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.
Etymology.
"Crypturellus" is formed from three Latin or Greek words. "kruptos" meaning covered or hidden, "oura" meaning tail, and "ellus" meaning diminutive. Therefore "Crypturellus" means small hidden tail.
Behavior.
Like other tinamous, the small-billed eats fruit off the ground or low-lying bushes. They also eat small amounts of invertebrates, flower buds, tender leaves, seeds, and roots. The male incubates the eggs which may come from as many as 4 different females, and then will raise them until they are ready to be on their own, usually 2–3 weeks. The nest is located on the ground in dense brush or between raised root buttresses.
Range and habitat.
The small-billed tinamou prefers dry savanna, but will also reside in lowland shrubland. Its range is Amazonian South America; Brazil except for the southeastern portion, northeastern Peru, eastern Bolivia, Paraguay, and northeastern Argentina.
Conservation.
The IUCN classifies this tinamou as Least Concern, with an occurrence range of .

Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf

The Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf was (despite the name) the first international conference of deaf educators held in Milan, Italy in 1880. It is commonly known as "The Milan Conference". After deliberations from September 6 to 11, 1880, the conference declared that oral education was superior to manual education and passed a resolution banning the use of sign language in school. After its passage in 1880, schools in European countries and the United States switched to using speech therapy without sign language as a method of education for the deaf.
Background.
Alexander Graham Bell and Edward Miner Gallaudet, both prominent U.S. figures in deaf education, had been debating the effectiveness of oral-only education versus an education that utilizes sign language as a means of visual communication, culminating in the Milan Conference in 1880 that passed eight resolutions on deaf education.
The Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf (which, despite its name, was actually the first) was an international meeting of deaf educators from at least seven countries. There were five delegates from America and approximately 164 delegates total in attendance. The Congress was planned and organized by a committee created by the Pereire Society, a group that was against sign language. More than half of the people invited were known oralists; therefore, the Congress was biased and most, if not all, of the resolutions that were voted on by the delegates gave results in favor of the oral method. Many of the resolutions were worded in ways that supported the oral method, such as "Considering the incontestable superiority of speech over signs in restoring the deaf-mute to society, and in giving him a more perfect knowledge of language,/Declares –/That the Oral method ought to be preferred that of signs for the education and instruction of the deaf and dumb".
The Milan Conference was organized by the Pereire Society, an organization formed by the family of Jacob Rodrigues Pereira of France and financed by their numerous railroad and bank holdings (including Société Générale du Crédit Mobilier). The Pereire Society was a strong supporter of oralism. They organized the Milan conference with the intent to ban sign language. They secured this outcome by carefully selecting who was invited, inviting the delegates to see the oralist success in a local school, and by encouraging negative reactions to those giving speeches supporting sign language and cheering those supporting oralism.
Delegates.
The Milan Conference was attended by 164 delegates of various countries. Out of these 164 delegates only one, James Denison, was deaf. The conference president was Abbe Giulio Tarra.
The nationality of the remaining delegates is unknown. The five U.S. delegates present were James Denison, Edward Miner Gallaudet, Reverend Thomas Gallaudet, Isaac Lewis Peet and Charles A Stoddard.
Conference.
The Conference was held in the Regio Institutio Tenico di Santa Martha, Milan. It was held from 6 September to 11 September 1880. The aim of the conference was to ban sign language from deaf education. During the conference there were 12 speakers who gave their opinions on the issues connected with deaf education. Nine of the twelve speakers gave an oralist view and three (the Gallaudet brothers, and Richard Elliot, a teacher from England) supported the use of sign language.
The eight resolutions.
1. The Convention, considering the incontestable superiority of articulation over signs in restoring the deaf-mute to society and giving him a fuller knowledge of language, declares that the oral method should be preferred to that of signs in education and the instruction of deaf-mutes.
2. The Convention, considering that the simultaneous use of articulation and signs has the disadvantage of injuring articulation and lip-reading and the precision of ideas, declares that the pure oral method should be preferred.
3. Considering that a great number of the deaf and dumb are not receiving the benefit of instruction, and that this condition is owing to the impotence of families and of institutions, recommends that governments should take the necessary steps that all the deaf and dumb may be educated.
4. Considering that the teaching of the speaking deaf by the Pure Oral method should resemble as much as possible that of those who hear and speak, declares 
5. Considering the want of books sufficiently elementary to help the gradual and progressive development of language, recommends that the teachers of the Oral system should apply themselves to the publication of special works on the subject.
6. Considering the results obtained by the numerous inquiries made concerning the deaf and dumb of every age and every condition long after they had quit school, who, when interrogated upon various subjects, have answered correctly, with sufficient clearness of articulation, and read the lips of their questioners with the greatest facility, declares:
7. Considering that the education of the deaf and dumb by speech has peculiar requirements; considering also that the experienced of teachers of deaf-mutes is almost unanimous, declares
8. Considering that the application of the Pure Oral method in institutions where it is not yet in active operation, should be to avoid the certainty of failure prudent, gradual, progressive, recommends 
Opposition.
Delegates from the United States and Britain were the only ones who opposed the use of oralism as a sole method of instruction, but were unsuccessful in their efforts at the congress. Edward Miner Gallaudet and Reverend Thomas Gallaudet were among the protesters who fought against the oralist method. Since failing to overturn the Milan resolutions, Gallaudet ensured that the United States would not be completely converted to oralism-only, which included allowing high school students in institutes for the deaf to use sign language and maintaining Gallaudet College (now Gallaudet University) as a university that permits full usage of sign language.
The National Association of the Deaf was also formed in the United States in response to the Milan Conference and was dedicated toward preserving American Sign Language.
First repudiation 100 years later in Hamburg.
At the Fifteenth International Congress on the Education of the Deaf (ICED) held in Hamburg, West Germany in 1980, the first major precedent for the repudiation of the 1880 resolutions was set by a large group of attendees who rejected the 1880 resolutions in practical-moral terms by the method of informal consensus in deciding that the 1880 resolutions had no appropriate standing, originally, in 1880. As explained by Richard G. Brill: "At the International Congress in Hamburg in 1980, however, the Milan resolutions were challenged head-on in major professional addresses at the opening of the congresses. It was recognized and accepted that resolutions concerning methodology were not appropriate at such international congresses because of the unlikelihood that the delegates fully represented the practices and philosophies of their home countries." Rather than seek to directly overturn the 1880s resolutions, the Congress put forward "Recommendations" for informational purposes, including the following: "Recommended that this International Congress on Education of the Deaf, in convocation gathered at Hamburg, West Germany, in August 1980, affirms and declares that all deaf children have the right to flexible communication in the mode or combination of modes which best meets their individual needs." Sharkey and Hikins deemed this Recommendation, along with the others, as constituting overturning the 1880 Milan Congress's resolutions.
In spite of the previous precedent set in 1980, in July 2010 in Vancouver, Canada, the board of the 21st International Congress on the Education of the Deaf (ICED) formally voted to reject all of the 1880 Milan resolutions.

Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy

Manchester United Football Club Under-21s is the most senior of Manchester United's youth teams and the club's former reserve team. They play in League 1 of the Professional Development League. The team is effectively Manchester United's second-string side, but is limited to three outfield players and one goalkeeper over the age of 21 per game following the introduction of new regulations from the 2012–13 season. They were champions of the former Premier Reserve League five times (in 2002, 2005, 2006, 2010 and 2012) between its introduction in 1999 and its dissolution in 2012. The team also won the 2012–13 Professional U21 Development League 1 in its inaugural season. The team also participates in the Manchester Senior Cup and the Lancashire Senior Cup.
The team's manager is Warren Joyce, who took over from Ole Gunnar Solskjær as manager of the reserves in December 2010, after spending two years as Solskjær's assistant. Joyce was previously the manager of Royal Antwerp, Manchester United's feeder club in Belgium. From November 2008 to August 2013, the team played its home matches at Moss Lane in Altrincham, the home of Altrincham F.C. Starting from the 2013-14 Under 21 Premier League season, the side will play the majority of its home matches at Salford City Stadium in Barton-upon-Irwell. In previous seasons, the team has played at the Victoria Stadium, the home of Northwich Victoria, and Ewen Fields, the home of Hyde.
Manchester United also has an Under-18s team, managed by Paul McGuinness, that plays in the Premier League Under-18s Group 2 and the FA Youth Cup. The under-18s play their home games at the club's Aon Training Complex in Carrington.

Academy.
The Manchester United Academy was established in 1998, following the reorganisation of youth football in England, but has roots stretching all the way back to the 1930s with the establishment of the Manchester United Junior Athletic Club (MUJAC). and has been responsible for producing some of Manchester United's greatest ever players, including the club's top five all-time appearance makers, Ryan Giggs, Bobby Charlton, Bill Foulkes, Paul Scholes and Gary Neville, and the new wave of home-grown talents known as "Fergie's Fledglings". The current academy is based at the club's Aon Training Complex, an site in the Manchester suburb of Carrington.
The Manchester United youth team is statistically the most successful in English football, with nine players in the English football Hall of Fame (Duncan Edwards, Sir Bobby Charlton, George Best, Nobby Stiles, Mark Hughes, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, David Beckham and Johnny Giles). Manchester United also have the best FA Youth Cup record, winning on 10 occasions out of 14 final appearances.
The academy comprises age-group teams ranging from Under-9s up to the flagship Under-18s, who currently compete in Group C of the Premier Academy League and in the FA Youth Cup. The Under-16s and Under-18s typically play their academy league games at 11am on Saturday mornings at Carrington, while Youth Cup games are generally played at either Altrincham's Moss Lane ground (where the under-21s play their home games) or the club's 76,000-capacity Old Trafford home, in order to cater for the greater number of supporters these fixtures attract.
Paul McGuinness is the head coach of the under-18s academy side. He was in charge of the side that won the 2011 FA Youth Cup after beating Sheffield United 6–3 on aggregate.
In 2007, Manchester United Under-18s were the inaugural winners of the Champions Youth Cup, intended to be a Club World Championship for youth sides, beating Juventus 1–0 in the final in Malaysia.
Notable former youth team players.
The following is a list of players who have represented a country (not necessarily their country of birth) at full international level.
Players of the Year.
Prior to 1990, a single award was presented to the best young player of that season. Between 1982 and 1985 this was the entitled "Young Player of the Year"; the award then became known as the "Denzil Haroun, Young Player of the Year" between 1986 and 1989 in honour of Denzil Haroun, a former club director and brother-in-law of former club chairman Louis Edwards.
Since 1990, individual awards are made to the best player of the Academy and the Reserves. The "Young Player of the Year" is named in honour of Jimmy Murphy, Sir Matt Busby's long-time assistant manager, who died in 1989, and the best reserve is awarded the "Denzil Haroun, Reserve Player of the Year".

In U.S. politics, the Hyde Amendment is a legislative provision barring the use of certain federal funds to pay for abortions with exceptions for incest and rape. It is not a permanent law, rather it is a "rider" that, in various forms, has been routinely attached to annual appropriations bills since 1976. The Hyde Amendment applies only to funds allocated by the annual appropriations bill for the Department of Health and Human Services. It primarily affects Medicaid.
The original Hyde Amendment was passed on September 30, 1976 by the House of Representatives, by a 207-167 vote. It was named for its chief sponsor, Republican Congressman Henry Hyde of Illinois. The measure was a response to the 1973 Supreme Court case "Roe v. Wade" which legalized abortion, and represented the first major legislative success by the United States pro-choice movement. Congress subsequently altered the Hyde Amendment several times. The version in force from 1981 until 1993 prohibited the use of federal funds for abortions “except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.”
On October 22, 1993, President Clinton signed into law the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994.  The Act contained a new version of the Hyde Amendment that expanded the category of abortions for which federal funds are available under Medicaid to include cases of rape and incest.  
Effect on low-income women.
Opponents of the amendment, such as the National Abortion Federation and the American Civil Liberties Union, assert that it unfairly targets low-income women, stating the amendment effectively ended the provision of abortions for low-income women across the United States through Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for low-income Americans. As a rider attached to the yearly appropriations bill for Medicaid, it occasioned intense debate in Congress each time that it came up for renewal. The original measure made no exceptions for cases of pregnancies that were the result of rape or incest or that threatened the lives of pregnant woman, provoking an outcry from women's rights advocates. As a result, beginning in 1977 language was added to provide for such circumstances; however, the exact wording has varied from one year to the next, subject to the outcome of Congressional bargaining on the issue.
State actions.
The cutoff of federal Medicaid funds prompted some states to provide public funding for abortion services from their own coffers. Over time the number of states doing so has gradually expanded, either through legislation or consequent to judicial rulings mandating equal access to health care for low-income women. As of 2007, 17 of the 50 states provide such funding, and 13 of these are required by court order to do so.
Related laws.
The Hyde Amendment inspired the passage of other similar provisions extending the ban on funding of abortions to a number of other federal health care programs. Consequently, those federal government employees who wish to have abortions must pay for them "out-of-pocket". In addition, abortion services are not provided for U.S. military personnel and their families, Peace Corps volunteers, Indian Health Service clients, or federal prisoners.
The Hyde Amendment should not be confused with the Mexico City Policy, which prohibited US government funds from going to agencies that promote or perform abortions in other countries. It prevented funds to agencies that promoted abortion regardless of whether or not they actually performed them, while the Hyde Amendment has a more limited scope.
The Stupak–Pitts Amendment, an amendment to the Affordable Health Care for America Act, was introduced by Democratic Rep. Bart Stupak of Michigan. It prohibits use of Federal funds "to pay for any abortion or to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion" except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the life of the mother, and was included in the bill as passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009. However, the Senate bill passed by the House on March 21, 2010 did not contain that Hyde Amendment language. As part of an agreement between Rep. Stupak and President Obama to secure Stupak's vote, the President issued an executive order on March 24, 2010 affirming that the Hyde Amendment would extend to the new bill.

Stod (Czech Republic)

Stod (; ) is a town in the Plzeň Region of the Czech Republic. It lies some south-west from the region capital of Plzeň upon the Radbuza River. 
Stod is also the seat of the Municipality with Extended Competence.
History.
The first written mention of Staab / Stod dates from 1235, when Wenceslaus I of Bohemia left the village to the monastery Chotěšov ("Chotieschau" in German). In 1315 John of Bohemia raised the villages status to that of a market town ("Marktflecken"). By the period of Charles IV in 1363, the town acquired more privileges, such as a judiciary, the right to use a city seal, and to keep the city's books. In 1544 the town was granted the privilege of establishing a malt-house and a brewery. By 1547 there was a post office and in 1550 granted Ferdinand I allowed the town to stage an annual fair. 
The town was set back by the turmoil of the Thirty Years War. By 1654, the settlement was almost deserted, with only about 230 residents. Consequently tracts of land were distributed to German families from Bavaria to repopulate the region.
By 1850 Staab / Stod had grown to approximately 1500 residents (almost entirely German speaking) and the town received civic rights ("Stadtrechte"). The town was the seat of a local District Court. At this time some local German peasants could not afford to buy land so in 1863 a small group, led by a former Austrian army officer named Captain Martin Krippner, left to settle Puhoi in New Zealand. (This has given Puhoi the popular appellation of the "Bohemian Settlement".) 
In 1938 the town was part of the Sudetenland annxed by Nazi Germany. After World War II the native German population was harassed, stripped of their property and brutally expelled following the notorious Beneš decrees. 
Between 1949 and 1960 there were various local government reforms following the massive population changes. The town now belongs to the district "Stod Lelov" (Lellowa).

Johann Faulhaber

Johann Faulhaber (5 May 1580 – 10 September 1635) was a German mathematician.
Born in Ulm, Faulhaber was a trained weaver who later took the role of a surveyor of the city of Ulm. He collaborated with Johannes Kepler and Ludolph van Ceulen. Besides his work on the fortifications of cities (notably Basel and Frankfurt), Faulhaber built water wheels in his home town and geometrical instruments for the military. Faulhaber made the first publication of Henry Briggs's Logarithm in Germany. He died in Ulm.
Faulhaber's major contribution was in calculating the sums of powers of integers. Jacob Bernoulli makes references to Faulhaber in his "Ars Conjectandi".

Barred tinamou

The barred tinamou ("Crypturellus casiquiare") is a type of tinamou commonly found in lowland moist forest in subtropical and tropical regions of northern South America.
Taxonomy.
This is a monotypic species. All tinamou are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.
Etymology.
"Crypturellus" is formed from three Latin or Greek words. "kruptos" meaning covered or hidden, "oura" meaning tail, and "ellus" meaning diminutive. Therefore "Crypturellus" means small hidden tail.
Description.
The barred tinamou is approximately in length. It is yellowish-buff with heavy bars of black on its back, its throat is white, its front and sides of neck and breast are pale grey, its belly is white, its flanks are cream barred with black, and its head and neck are chestnut in color with legs that are olive-green. The female is paler on back.
Behavior.
Like other tinamous, the barred tinamou eats fruit off the ground or low-lying bushes. They also eat small amounts of invertebrates, flower buds, tender leaves, seeds, and roots. The male incubates the eggs which may come from as many as 4 different females, and then will raise them until they are ready to be on their own, usually 2–3 weeks. The nest is located on the ground in dense brush or between raised root buttresses.
Range and habitat.
It prefers to live in tropical and sub-tropical lowland forests at an altitude of or lower. This species is native to eastern Colombia and southern Venezuela.
Conservation.
The IUCN classifies the barred tinamou as Least Concern, with an occurrence range of .

Danio margaritatus

Danio margaritatus, the celestial pearl danio, often referred to in the aquarium trade as galaxy rasbora or "Microrasbora" sp. 'Galaxy', is a small cyprinid from Myanmar. It has so far been found only in a very small area near Hopong east of Inle Lake, at an altitude of over 1,000 m (3,400 ft). Its habitat is part of the Salween basin, namely the Nam Lang and Nam Pawn Rivers. Discovered in 2006, the species quickly appeared in the aquarium trade, where its small size and bright colours made it an instant hit.
Description.
This is a small, plump danionin with a markedly blunt snout, measuring just 2–2.5 cm standard length. The body is about three times as long as it is high. In general shape, it resembles "Danio erythromicron" more than any other known species. 
This species shows some sexual dimorphism: males have a bright-blue background color (dull blue-green in females), and their fins are more brightly colored. The tail end of their bodies (the caudal peduncle) is also higher than in females. The body is sprinkled with small, pearly dots. The back is bronzy green, and the belly in females is yellowish-white. The gill covers are transparent, letting the blood-red gills shine through.
The males' fins (except the pectoral fins), which they will prominently display to conspecifics, show two parallel black lines with a bright red area in between; on the tail fin, this pattern is present twice (once on each lobe) and the outer black band is vestigial. Females have a weaker version of the pattern in the tail and dorsal fins only, sometimes in the anal fin, too.
A courting male develops a red belly and the flanks brighten and darken, making the pearly spots stand out even more, with the back appearing paler than the flanks and also standing out. A female in reproductive age can be recognized by a black anal spot which separates the belly color from the uniformly reddish base of the anal fin. The male has a small black pad at the edges of the lower jaw, which is absent or reduced in females. Immature fish show some indication of a striped pattern, which eventually decomposes into the pearly dots.
Systematics and taxonomy.
Initially, the celestial pearl danio was assumed to be a member of the genus "Microrasbora", due to its similarity to ""Microrasbora" erythromicron". Less than a year after the discovery of the celestial pearl danio, it was scientifically described and given the genus name "Celestichthys". In 2008, a more comprehensive study showed the celestial pearl danio was a member of the genus "Danio", with "Danio erythromicron" and "Danio choprae" as its closest relatives.
Ecology.
The fish lives in small ponds created by seeping groundwater or overflow from small brooks or springs. Water temperature in January was rather low (22–24°C), but as the habitat is very shallow, it would heat up quickly during hot spells, thus "D. margaritatus" is probably tolerant of temperatures in the low to mid 20s. Like most water bodies in the Inle drainage, the water is slightly alkaline. The habitat is heavily vegetated with Hydrocharitaceae similar to "Elodea" (water weed).
The celestial pearl danio shares its habitat with very few fish species. Namely, a "Microrasbora" similar to "M. rubescens", a rosy loach ("Yunnanilus", possibly a new species) and the dwarf snakehead "Channa harcourtbutleri". The latter species presumably is the only known significant predator of "D. margaritatus".
The species is locally fished for food to some extent; it is dried and bought as a protein source by poor people. A can of some 500 "D. margaritatus" sold for food fetched about 25 kyat (about 2 UK pounds/3.9 US$/2.7 EUR) before the fish was discovered for the aquarium trade.
Reproduction.
The spawning behavior has significant consequences for captive breeding (see below). The celestial pearl danio appears to be adapted to somewhat ephemeral habitats. It does not have a dedicated spawning season, nor do the females lay continuously. Rather, they produce small batches of around 30 eggs per spawning episode. The time between spawnings is unknown at present. Eggs are not strewn freely into the water, but they are not deposited in clutches to a prepared surface either; rather, it seems, that they are hidden away in vegetation as a loose batch. Courting males will seek out and try to defend a patch of dense vegetation. While pursuit swimming has been observed, it does not seem to be connected directly to the actual act of reproduction in which the male displays to a passing female, and tests her readiness with a brief chase. The pair then moves into the substrate and deposits the eggs. Other males noticing reproduction will try and follow the mating pair, either to try to fertilize the eggs with their own sperm or eat them.
At 24–25 °C, the larvae hatch after 3–4 days. They are dark and cryptic initially and for about three days after hatching, they hide away between substrate and detritus and are very hard to see. They subsequently become lighter in color and start swimming freely and feeding on their own. At some 8–10 weeks after hatching, they undergo metamorphosis to adult form, and the color pattern starts to appear from week 12 onwards.
Status and conservation.
Within six months of its appearance in the aquarium trade, the species was falsely reported as having become so rare, collectors were obtaining only a "few dozen fish per day". Initially, only a small number of aquarists managed to breed the fish successfully, while nearly all the fish offered for sale were wild-caught. The (unfounded) concern over the wild populations led British fishkeeping magazine "Practical Fishkeeping" to request that only aquarists prepared to breed the fish should buy any fish they see for sale, to reduce pressure on the wild stocks by diminishing the demand for them in the UK. As the species seems adapted to living in and colonizing small, possibly ephemeral pools, it seemed not very well able to withstand prolonged and intense exploitation—if the stock in all pools at one location is entirely fished off, it is unclear in how far the fish would be able to recolonize them. Conversely, if only part of a local subpopulation is removed, pools from which all celestial pearl danios have been removed likely will be recolonized with a healthy population again after one year or so.
The dire warnings reported by Clarke, later in 2007 were found to be unfounded. The celestial pearl danio is prolific, spawning "almost every day", causing ponds that were thought to be empty to be fully restocked a few months later as fry hatched, grew, and reproduced quickly.
The government of Myanmar banned exports of the fish in February 2007. However, an inquest into the species by Myanmar officials discovered populations of the fish in at least "five locations around Hopong". Currently, the fish is captive-bred worldwide commercially and by hobbyists, pushing the price down from its initial high of $20 or more per fish to around $4 each.
In the aquarium.
The celestial pearl danio is a rather undemanding fish if its basic requirements are being met. It seems quite hardy, but obviously thrives best in fairly soft and slightly alkaline water at not too high a temperature—conditions that can often be met with treated tap water. It does not require much space, as it is not a very active swimmer, and is not a true shoaling fish, meaning it does not require large numbers of conspecifics for its well-being. In a small tank, a group of six individuals—half males, half females—will do well and exhibit natural behavior. They tend to be rather stationary, hovering in a peculiar position in favorite spots; males and females tend to keep separate when at rest. Altogether, their behavior again resembles "Danio erythromicron" more than other fish. 
Tanks for the celestial pearl danio should be well-planted and direct daylight may be favorable (the natural habitat is so shallow as to be well lit throughout). Water weed and similar plants should be abundant, and stones and wood to create hiding spots should be provided. It is advisable to supply the fish with a spawning mop or a dense growth of suitable plants (java moss has been successfully used). A dense tangle of natural plants for spawning has the additional advantage of harboring protists on which the fry feed initially. The celestial pearl danio seems overall quite peaceful, though some fin-nipping occurs. Consequently, it cannot be kept with large or "bully" fish. Small, swarming danionins which require similar water conditions would be a natural choice for company, as such more active species provide nice contrast behaviorally and, being available in a wide range of colors and patterns, also make it possible to choose fish that complement the brilliant colors of "D. margaritatus". Many danionins prefer slightly acidic water, however, and maintaining the rather high pH found across the Inle basin seems a necessary condition to keep fish from there successfully.

Duddo Tower

Duddo Tower is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and a Grade II listed building comprising the ruinous remains of an ancient pele tower and 16th century tower house, situated on a prominence on the south side of the village of Duddo, Northumberland, England.
The Tower was part of the ancient manor of Duddo, of some , owned by the Stryvelling family. The pele tower was destroyed by the Scots in 1496. The estate was later acquired by the Clavering family who rebuilt a tower house on the site in the late 16th century. The house was usually occupied by a junior branch of the family until it was abandoned as a home in the 17th century.
The estate was sold in 1788 by John Clavering of Callaly Castle to Sir Francis Blake and sold on by the Blakes (for £45000) in 1823 to Thomas Fryer.

C.C. (Code Geass)

Character outline.
C.C. is an immortal girl who outwardly appears to be little more than 16 years old. She becomes Lelouch Lamperouge's accomplice when he makes a Geass contract with her. She is willful almost to a fault, usually doing whatever she wants regardless of whether or not it inconveniences others, particularly with Lelouch. She also likes to withhold information, usually telling people just enough to leave them wondering. C.C. has a strong penchant for pizza, especially Pizza Hut's (which sponsors the show in Japan, though the logo is blurred out or digitally removed in the English dub); she constantly orders pizzas to Lelouch's house using his credit card. She also carries around a stuffed toy of "Cheese-kun", the company's mascot in Japan. Her love of pizza is often used for comedic effect, as she was twice willing to risk capture simply to get a piece of a giant pizza being made by the Student Council (which is ruined both times). Both Lelouch and Kallen sometimes refer to her as "Pizza Girl".
C.C. is initially introduced as a mysterious, calm, collected and cool-headed young woman that carries herself with an endearing sense of pride, playful self-assurance and nonchalance. As the series develops, however, it is revealed that C.C.'s experiences over the course of her considerable lifetime, compounded by the implications of leading an immortal existence without death, have led her to gradually adopt a seemingly mocking and unsympathetic, though logical view of the world, and even perhaps what might be described as a somewhat nihilistic outlook on life and existence. Despite the often nonchalant manner in which she conducts herself, it is revealed that C.C. is, in actuality, quite sensitive on the subject of her own humanity, and is, incidentally, scornful of her immortality, which she describes as 'merely an experience' in accordance with the idea that existing and living are mutually exclusive, as living implies that there is an end. C.C's experience with her immortal condition has left her with a deep and sorrowful sense of loneliness and isolation, and is ultimately a fate that she is implied to be seeking final restitution from throughout the series. Though C.C. often teases and instigates petty frictions between herself and Lelouch, she is, in actuality, deeply loyal to him, with many instances throughout the series whereby she intentionally elects to disregard her own safety in order to protect Lelouch from harm. Throughout the series, C.C also demonstrates having a dry, mildly sardonic and somewhat peculiar sense of humor, often finding amusement in things that others do not, or alternatively, amusement in things that are strictly contained between herself and Lelouch. C.C., by her own admission, is apparently not fond of conventional humor, going so far as to bluntly proclaim that she "hates jokes".
C.C. reveals to Lelouch that she has been alive so long that she can no longer remember who loves her and who hates her. Due to her nature and history, she has been lonely as long as she can remember. Lelouch replies, "You're not alone. We are each other's accomplice. If you are a Witch, then perhaps I should be a Demon." Lelouch is possibly the first person that has ever truly cared for her and it appears that she reciprocates at least some feelings, as she unexpectedly kisses him after their memories are shared. However she claims that she has only been using Lelouch so that she can die. But in episode 23 of the second season, Suzaku, in describing himself as the sword that slashes down Lelouch's enemies, asks her to be his shield, protecting him from pain. Also, in episode 24 when she was fighting Kallen, Kallen stated that she has no will or ambition to fight, and she replies she has a promise prompting Kallen to ask if she loves Lelouch, C.C. replies with a glance down saying she doesn't know, referring to her relationship with Lelouch thus far. When left alone, she has sometimes spoken to a previously unknown person through means unknown, which, in episode 23, was revealed to be Marianne, Lelouch's deceased mother, although in episode 19 it appears that she is talking to V.V. as well. According to the DVD Magazine 02, she is talking to more than one person when she seems to be talking to herself. She gave Marianne the power of Geass and therefore had the same relationship with her as she now has with Lelouch.
Appearance.
C.C. has long, almost waist-length green hair and gold eyes. She is of average female height, being approximately as tall as Kallen.
C.C.'s outfits are both plentiful and varied. She is seen wearing a wide assortment of different clothes, often dependent on the situation or time period. She often wears Lelouch's own clothes, including his Zero costume should Lelouch ever require a decoy.
However, in the first season, C.C. primarily wears the outfit she initially appears in—a white straitjacket used to restrain her during her time as a test subject for the Britannian Empire prior to the series beginning. These suits contain many means of restraint, including various straps and zippers and a high collar capable of gagging the wearer. When not set to fully bind the wearer, the suits have rather long sleeves that flare outwards closer to the cuffs. A number of these bondage suits are seen in the Geass research laboratories. The reason for C.C.'s common use of the suit is because she isn't free, instead being a slave to the world. She is seen wearing it through most of the first season and the end of the second season.
C.C.'s predominant outfit in the second season is her Black Knights uniform which is significantly different from those of the other Black Knights. Rather than the usual Black Knights jacket, C.C. wears a sleeveless black uniform with a high collar, gold trim, and a silver Black Knights symbol on the chest. The lower end of the uniform splits off into four long pieces that nearly extend to the floor. A long, adorned red sash is also worn around the waist. C.C. also wears long black gloves with gold trim kept on with red bands on the upper arms as well as long white and gold high-heeled boots. Underneath her uniform, C.C. wears a cropped sleeveless white turtle-neck and white boyshorts. She is often seen wearing only these undergarments.
Character history.
Before C.C. gained the power of Geass, she was a ten-year-old orphaned slave. A nun gave C.C. the power of Geass that made everyone fall in love with her. She grew tired of the love without limits and focused more on the nun, the only one who was above C.C.'s power. However, when C.C.'s power evolved to its highest point, the nun revealed that she never cared for C.C. and was only using her so that she could escape her immortal life. A shock sequence in the first season finale shows memories of her past, including repeated "deaths" of different types spanning centuries. In a special feature included in the series' fifth DVD, she and Lelouch discuss Washington's Rebellion, during which she speaks of participants such as George Washington and Benjamin Franklin as if she had been close friends with both. She claims to have entered into contracts with hundreds of people over her lifetime, almost none of which could reach the point of taking on her immortality.
One of her previous contracts was with Marianne, Lelouch's mother. When she aided Marianne with helping Charles achieve his goal, C.C. was made head of the Geass Order, a secret organization that studies and produces Geass users. However, when news of Marianne's death came to her, C.C. left the order, leaving V.V. to take over the operations. It would only be later that C.C. was captured by a Britannian envoy under Clovis, who took an interest in the girl's immortality and intended to bring her to Pendragon. However, that led to a chain of events to occur in the ruins of Tokyo.
First season.
C.C. is introduced in the first episode, where she emerges from a fake gas capsule seized by Japanese rebels. She saves Lelouch Lamperouge from the Britannian soldiers trying to recapture her, taking the shot intended for him, and grants him the power of Geass on the condition that he grant her greatest wish. Lelouch accepts and is granted the power to control people's actions. Since she appears to have died following this, he leaves her body behind.
She unexpectedly reappears in the fifth episode, casually folding origami with Nunnally. From this point on she passively oversees Lelouch's missions as Zero, wanting to keep him alive so he can fulfill his contract, often going as far as wearing his clothes and impersonating him when situations become life-threatening.
When C.C.'s existence is revealed to the Black Knights, she gains considerable unofficial standing, as she is seen by other members to be one of Zero's closest advisers, if not his top adviser. However, her willful attitude and lack of an official posting annoys some veteran members and causes confusion as to her role within the Black Knights. At one point, Tamaki goes so far as to accuse her of being a member only because she's Zero's lover, a claim which she coldly denies. When the Black Knights gain possession of the Knightmare Frame Gawain, she becomes its pilot while Lelouch operates the weapons.
In the season finale, she uses the Gawain to battle Jeremiah Gottwald's Siegfried so Lelouch can save his sister. She kisses Lelouch before she drags both the Siegfried and herself to the ocean floor to end the battle while narrating that the spark of Lelouch's actions was the core of human motivation: the desire for just a small amount of happiness. According to Yukana in a conference memo, C.C. was crushed by the water pressure, but being immortal, ultimately drifted to the surface and revived; it is stated that it was too gruesome to be shown.
Second season (R2).
At the start of the second season, C.C. appears to be commanding the Black Knights. She and the rest of the surviving Black Knights initiate an operation to unlock Zero's memory that was sealed away by the Emperor of Britannia. Despite the Intelligence Agency having followed Lelouch in anticipation of that exact outcome, she is successful in restoring his memories by the kiss. She takes up her old position following this.
After pinpointing the location of the Geass Order, Lelouch orders C.C. to lead the attack against it. She reluctantly kills V.V.'s direct subordinates when they attempt to escape by bullet train in order to bury the existence of Geass, apologizing for leaving them to their own devices. C.C. later reveals her wish to Lelouch after he is transported to the Sword of Akasha to face the Emperor, explaining that her greatest wish is to die and as Lelouch is not ready, she is offering it to Charles. Lelouch tells her she shouldn't die looking unhappy, promising he will make her smile while saving her. However, in the attempt, C.C.'s memories of everything past the day she acquired her Geass are lost, reverting her to a frightened slave girl. Believing himself to be responsible, Lelouch confines C.C. to his quarters and attempts to make her comfortable.
After Lelouch's identity is exposed to the Black Knights and he is evacuated by Rolo, Marianne takes over Anya's body and uses it to locate C.C. and restore her memories. The two then leave for Kamine Island, rescuing Suzaku along the way. Marianne enters the Sword of Akasha, while C.C. stays behind to speak with Suzaku. She compares herself to him, as both have a death wish they cannot fulfill. Suzaku denies this and has C.C. take them to the Sword of Akasha. C.C.'s presence allows the Emperor to begin the Ragnarök Connection. When Lelouch turns the tables and the collective unconsciousness destroys Charles and Marianne, C.C. is spared their fate because she has turned against their plan.
Later on, after Lelouch seizes the Britannian throne, C.C. comforts him when he is troubled on what to do about Nunnally being aligned against him. Before heading into battle, C.C. asks Lelouch if he hates her for giving him Geass and changing his fate. Lelouch explains that he's grateful, both to Geass and her, for allowing him to move forward. She smiles and says this is the first time she's ever met a man like him. Lelouch says her name and the begin walking toward each other. They are interrupted when Kallen attacks in the Guren, ready to kill Lelouch. C.C. intervenes in her Lancelot, buying Lelouch time to escape, telling him to come back so he can make her smile. She engages in battle against Kallen. During their battle, Kallen questions her lack of motivation, and asks if C.C. loves Lelouch. C.C. isn't sure about the matter, still wanting to put an end to her unending life. C.C. is easily defeated, but ejects to safety, surprised that she even cares about winning or losing. During Lelouch's planned assassination, she prays for him at a church, shedding a single tear while commenting on the price he's paying for using Geass on others.
During the epilogue, C.C. is seen traveling the countryside in the back of a cart. She talks about how the Geass is supposed to bring loneliness, yet Lelouch proved this wrong. With the knowledge that Lelouch did not hate her for giving him the Geass, she is now able to express her true feelings addressing Lelouch, leaving his fate somewhat ambiguous.
Abilities.
C.C. has the power of the "Code", which renders her immortal, capable neither of aging nor of being killed by conventional means. She has been shot fatally a number of times, crushed by water pressure, burned at the stake, beheaded by a guillotine, and placed in an iron maiden, and each time she survived and eventually recovered. C.C. also has the ability to bestow people with the power of Geass, which manifests differently in each person but generally carries the ability to affect the minds of those it is used on in some way.
When touching another person, C.C. can afflict them with a hallucinatory experience (if need be) of chaotic and ominous images, pertaining in part to the memories of the target involved; the content varies with the afflicted. Physical contact, either direct or via a Knightmare Frame, may facilitate the process. Suzaku is shown images of his father (whom he murdered) as well as parts of C.C.'s memories, driving him into a panic. It tends to activate involuntarily at various points, such as when Lelouch's Geass becomes permanently active. This effect is described as 'a merging of consciousnesses'. The Geass sigil on her forehead glows whenever she manifests this power.
She is also able to cancel the effects of Geass from a person, this power being the reason she was being studied by Bartley Asprius. The only time she is seen using it however is when she releases Lelouch from his father's Geass. Bartley successfully copied this ability and from this created the Geass Canceler, which he then implanted into Jeremiah Gottwald. It is unknown whether this power manifests itself in any "Code" bearer or C.C. is a special case.
Apart from her psionic abilities, C.C. is a capable leader, able to rescue Lelouch from Britannian traps, handle firearms with some proficiency, and seems to be a skilled unarmed fighter as well. She is also an accomplished Knightmare pilot, able to pilot both standard Knightmare Frames as well as copilot the Gawain with Lelouch. In the Picture Dramas, during a discussion with Kallen, she states that she has the ability to do almost anything but chooses to let others do it.
Before becoming immortal, C.C.'s Geass, as contracted with a nun during apparently medieval times, granted her the power "to be loved," which allowed her to make anyone love her unconditionally. She originally started with a Geass symbol in her left eye, but as the power matured, she eventually developed another in her right eye, and became unable to control it, causing everyone to love her except the nun. After she became bored by the entranced society around her, the nun who had bound the Geass contract to her forced her "Code" into C.C., as signified by the Geass sigil on the nun's forehead transferring to hers. The ordeal also burned a similarly-shaped scar under her left breast. The nun, freed of the "Code", dies, and C.C. takes up the "Code" and everything that goes with it: the loss of her original Geass, immortality, immunity to other Geass, and the ability to bestow Geass on others.
Appearances in other media.
"Lost Colors".
In "Code Geass: Lost Colors", the video game for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable, there are a several different endings and clips of C.C. involving the main character, Rai. C.C. usually meets with Rai involving his memories and his Geass and is often concerned about him.
After C.C. left Lelouch's room with a box of pizza and entered Rai's room, C.C. then eat at his bed and encountered him. Depending on the first and the second choices the player makes won't affect the ending of the scene. In the first choice, if the player chooses either to "recall the incident at the airport" or "get angry", Rai unknowingly used his Geass on C.C., which she commented that because of her time with Nunnally has Rai manage to remember how to use Geass. C.C. later offered Rai to join the Black Knights, which caught Rai by surprise, and C.C. commented it would be easier to watch over him. This next scene involves the second choices, which won't affect the end. If the player chooses to accept C.C.'s offer, she becomes surprised as she thought he would refuse, which led Rai commenting her knowledge about Geass and trusts her decision. If the player chooses to refuse C.C.'s offer, she tells him not to bear a grudge on her if he unconsciously used Geass on Nunnally, which Rai suddenly thought about it and becomes upset if he were to unknowingly used geass. This led to Rai deciding to accept her offer if he would prevent others from getting involved.
"Nightmare of Nunnally".
In the manga spin-off series, Nemo appeared in a capsule with C.C. by its side and was picked up by Nunnally. When Nunnally is about to be killed, Nemo grants her a Geass ability that turns her body into Knightmare-like armor. During the process, C.C. sees Lelouch's plan to destroy Britannia with the newly formed Black Knights and acts as his double. In this continuity, it is revealed that once C.C. was known as the "Witch of Britannia" and was the rival and foe of Joan of Arc, known as the "Witch of Orleans", during the Hundred Years' War.
In Chapter 13, it is revealed that in this timeline, it was C.C. who killed Genbu Kururugi, not Suzaku; she did this to protect Lelouch and Nunnally, whom Genbu planned on killing.
"Code Geass (manga)".
C.C. is present in the manga with only a few differences in her appearances. She is discovered in a plane crash and she appears before Lelouch creates a plan to save Suzaku.
"Suzaku of the Counterattack".
Despite the plot differences, C.C.'s role is nearly identical to that of the anime. She is freed by Lelouch and Suzaku and gives Lelouch his Geass. Lelouch then takes C.C. back with him to Ashford Academy. Due to being grievously wounded shortly after freeing her, Suzaku does not recognize C.C.
"Renya of Darkness".
Set in the Edo period, C.C. appeared in an armor that was said to resemble that of Portuguese Jesuits and witnessed the attack led by Isshin Sumeragi on Renya's village. She later appeared before an injured Renya when he saw his friends being captured and threw his Shuriken at her. C.C. remained alive, however, which shocked Renya. She offered him a contract in exchange for the power to save his friends, which Renya accepted, and C.C. started the process. In the middle of it all, C.C. was surprised by a spark that appeared to be hurting Renya and by the appearance of an unknown long-haired figure bearing a resemblance to Lelouch. After that she asked Renya his name and revealed that he had somehow "failed".
"Another Century's Episode: R".
C.C. will make her appearance in the forth upcoming title, video game in her Knightmare Frame, Akatsuki Command Model C.C. Custom
While in battle with Lelouch and the Black Knights in their respective world, an unknown black energy has sucked her in with Lelouch and Kallen and transported in Eria, the A.C.E. R's main world.
"Super Robot Wars Z 2 Hakai-Hen".
C.C. and the rest of the Code Geass R1 cast will make their debut to the Super Robot Wars franchise in this game, using their R1 Knightmares.
"Nunnally in Wonderland".
In a special OVA parody episode, based on the "Alice in Wonderland" story, C.C. appears in the role as a fitting and enigmatic Cheshire Cat.

Tidal tail

A tidal tail is a thin, elongated region of stars and interstellar gas that extends into space from a galaxy. Tidal tails occur as a result of galactic tide forces between interacting galaxies. Examples of galaxies with tidal tails include the Tadpole Galaxy and the Mice Galaxies. Tidal forces can eject a significant amount of a galaxy's gas into the tail; within the Antennae Galaxies, for example, nearly half of the observed gaseous matter is found within the tail structures. Within those galaxies which have tidal tails, approximately 10% of the galaxy's stellar formation takes place in the tail. Overall, roughly 1% of all stellar formation in the known universe occurs within tidal tails. 
Some interacting galaxy pairs have two distinct tails, as is the case for the Antennae Galaxies, while other systems have only one tail. Most tidal tails are slightly curved due to the rotation of the host galaxies. Those that are straight may actually be curved but still appear to be straight if they are being viewed edge-on.
History.
The phenomena now referred to as tidal tails were first studied extensively by Fritz Zwicky in 1953. Several astrophysicists expressed their doubts that these extensions could occur solely as the result of tidal forces, including Zwicky himself, who described his own views as "unorthodox". Boris Vorontsov-Velyaminov argued that the tails were too thin and too long (sometimes as large as 100,000 parsecs) to have been produced by gravity alone, as gravity should instead produce broad distortions. However, in 1972, renowned astronomer Alar Toomre proved that it was indeed tidal forces that were responsible for the tails.

Jackie McDonald

John "Jackie" McDonald (born 2 August 1947) is a senior Northern Irish loyalist and the incumbent Ulster Defence Association (UDA) brigadier for South Belfast, having been promoted to the rank by former UDA commander Andy Tyrie in 1988, following John McMichael's killing by the Provisional IRA in December 1987. He is also a member of the organisation's Inner Council and the spokesman for the Ulster Political Research Group (UPRG), the UDA's political advisory body.
Ulster Defence Association.
Born in Belfast, Northern Ireland into a Protestant family, McDonald attended Larkfield Secondary School in Balmoral. He lives in the south Belfast housing estate of Taughmonagh. His paramilitary activities have attracted considerable publicity from the media, and he was the subject of interviews by journalist Peter Taylor for the latter's book "Loyalists". Described by journalist Rosie Cowan as the UDA's most powerful player, he is an outspoken critic of former Ulster Freedom Fighters' notorious brigadier, Johnny Adair. 
He joined the UDA in 1972 about a year after it was formed in Belfast as an umbrella organisation for loyalist vigilante groups. These groups, such as the Woodvale Defence Association (WDA) and Shankill Defence Association (SDA), had sprung up in loyalist areas following the outbreak of The Troubles in the late 1960s as a means of protecting their local communities from attacks by nationalists. He was a member of the Taughmonagh C Battalion South Belfast Brigade.
He was already a senior UDA member when he played a part in the Ulster Workers Council Strike, helping people on his south Belfast housing estate obtain food, medicine, transport and other necessities during the general strike which had brought Northern Ireland to a standstill in May 1974. At this time he held a job as dispatches manager for the Balmoral Furniture Company in the Shankill Road. It had been the target of a Provisional IRA bomb in December 1971, in which four people had died, including two infants. According to author Ian S. Wood, McDonald was almost killed during the strike when Military Police fired upon the hijacked vehicle he was driving in a chase along the Lisburn Road into Sandy Row. When receiving his social security payments during the strike, McDonald received a military salute from his boss when he walked into the latter's office wearing his complete UDA combat uniform.
Brigadier.
In the mid-1980s, McDonald became part of UDA "fundraiser" Jim Craig's large protection racket. In 1988, just after the death of UDA's South Belfast brigadier John McMichael, who was blown up in a booby-trap car bomb planted by the Provisional IRA outside his home in Lisburn, Supreme Commander Andy Tyrie promoted McDonald to the rank of brigadier. He subsequently assumed command of McMichael's South Belfast brigade having previously served as his second-in-command. Described by Peter Taylor as an "effective and popular commander", many people, however considered McDonald to have been one of Craig's "henchmen in the latter's profitable racketeering business." According to Steve Bruce Tyrie's appointment of McDonald as Brigadier helped to hasten Tyrie's own downfall due to the distaste with which McDonald was then regarded by a number of leading UDA figures. Due to his reputation as a racketeer and his close association with the widely disliked Craig and his equally loathed deputy Artie Fee, a number of UDA modernisers, who were the chief critics of Tyrie, released statements to both the local media and BBC "Newsnight" condemning McDonald's appointment.
McDonald admitted to Taylor: "Through not being able to get a job anywhere else and not being able to look after my own family and being part of the organisation that needed the money, eventually I did Craig yes." 
The same year McDonald took over the South Belfast brigade, Andy Tyrie resigned as UDA commander and James Craig was put permanently out of the picture. The latter was shot dead in the "Bunch of Grapes" pub in east Belfast by two masked gunmen from the UDA (using their cover name "Ulster Freedom Fighters") in October 1988 for "treason". It was claimed by younger elements within the UDA that he had set up John McMichael to be targeted by the IRA.
McDonald was arrested in 1989, and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment in the Maze Prison for extortion, blackmail and intimidation in January 1990. Following his imprisonment he was replaced as brigadier by Alex Kerr. He was released in 1994.
Return to power.
Returning to his role as brigadier after Kerr defected to the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) group which was founded by Billy Wright in 1996, McDonald found himself in 1997 facing the possibility of a loyalist feud with the local Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), with whom he had previously been on good terms. In June 1997, the son of murdered UDA man, James Curtis Moorehead, shot and killed his father's killer, the UVF's Robert "Basher" Bates (who was also part of the Shankill Butchers gang, led by Lenny Murphy), leading to the Shankill Road UDA "exiling" the young killer to Taughmonagh. UVF members began to prowl McDonald's Taughmonagh stronghold looking for the killer, and a clash between the Donegall Pass UVF and the Sandy Row UDA looked imminent as relations deteriorated both in South Belfast and throughout Northern Ireland as a whole. McDonald did not want a war with the UVF and, according to authors Henry McDonald and Jim Cusack, ultimately negotiated a settlement whereby the killer would be housed on the edge of Taugmonagh and told to keep a low profile.
The UDA gave its support to the Belfast Agreement in 1998 although McDonald was one of three Inner Council members - the others being John Gregg and Billy McFarland - who was less convinced about its merits, particularly the prospect of Sinn Féin entering any power-sharing executive. Nonetheless McDonald did not advocate a return to armed struggle and in late 1999 when it became clear that a feud between the UVF and LVF was about to begin he joined fellow brigadiers McFarland, Gregg and Jim Gray in announcing that the UDA would not be getting involved. Such sentiments were not echoed by west Belfast brigadier Johnny Adair however as he saw the LVF as close allies and resented the UVF.
Clashes with Johnny Adair.
McDonald grew further apart from Adair as the year 2000 progressed. Whilst supporting the Orange Order's desire to march through nationalist areas, McDonald was a lot less enthusiastic than Adair about getting involved in the Drumcree conflict. He had grown weary of seeing the mainstream unionist parties seek to ally themselves to loyalist paramilitaries when it was expedient only to sever any links as soon as the relationship no longer suited them. Similarly he was unconvinced by a series of vandalism attacks on loyalist areas in Belfast in late June by three carloads of "republicans", feeling that the missile throwing youths were actually members of Adair's C Company sent to stir up sectarian hatred and win support for Adair's Drumcree strategy. 
McDonald was one of a number of brigadiers to accept Adair's invitation to a "Loyalist Day of Culture" on the Shankill Road on 19 August 2000 but was shocked to find that C Company had used the day to drive UVF members and their families from the road, even attacking the homes of such UVF "elder statesmen" as Gusty Spence and Winston Churchill Rea. At the culmination of the day, McDonald and other brigadiers, as well as Deputy Lord Mayor of Belfast Frank McCoubrey, were brought onto a makeshift stage where C Company members emerged and fired machine guns into the air in a show of strength.
McDonald however retained his earlier attitude towards feuding with the C Company UDA, and along with McFarland and Gray, told his men to leave the Shankill that evening. McDonald promptly contacted his opposite number in the South Belfast UVF and concluded a pact that their members would not attack each other. Even when the initial feud cooled, the enmity between McDonald and Adair continued to simmer and in Inner Council meetings the two frequently clashed as, according to one veteran loyalist, "Jackie was the only one with the balls to stand up to him". Nonetheless when Adair was released from prison on 15 May 2002, McDonald, arguing that he deserved a second chance and hoping that his return to prison may have mellowed him, was one of the brigadiers to appear at Adair's Boundary Way home and welcome him back in front of the television cameras.
The public show of bonhomie between McDonald and Adair did not result in improved relations in the long term. On 14 September 2002, East Belfast LVF man Stephen Warnock was killed by the Red Hand Commando and immediately afterwards Adair, seeing an opportunity to strike back at a rival, went to his family home to inform visiting LVF members that the killing had been actually ordered by Jim Gray. On Adair's encouragement, an LVF hit team waited for Gray to appear at Warnock's house where, after he paid his respects to the family, he was shot in the face as he left. Gray was seriously injured but survived the attack. 
McDonald called a crisis meeting of brigadiers, including Adair, at Sandy Row but it failed to reach a conclusion as Adair denied involvement in the attack on Gray. As soon as the meeting was over, Adair drove to Ballysillan in north Belfast to meet with allies in the LVF, although he was unaware that a mainstream UDA team were following him and recording his movements. When McDonald was told about this second meeting he secured agreement with the other brigadiers that Adair should be expelled from the UDA. Tension simmered for the next few months with little real fighting although McDonald threw a ring of steel around his Taughmonagh stronghold and even obtained an air raid siren to be sounded if any C Company members attempted to enter the estate.
The killing of John Gregg and his associate Rab Carson by C Company in Sailortown on 1 February 2003 however finally led to a showdown, with McDonald taking charge of the anti-Adair faction. McDonald quickly got word to A and B Company of the West Belfast UDA, covering the Highfield estate and Woodvale areas of the Greater Shankill and nominally under Adair's command, that Adair was to be removed and secured the loyalty of these two groups. He also told them to set up an office on the Shankill's Heather Street Social Club as a safe house where members of C Company could defect back to the mainstream UDA. 
At around 1 a.m. on 6 February 2003, about 100 heavily armed UDA members invaded the lower Shankill and set upon the twenty or so members of C Company who had remained loyal to Adair. For his part Adair fled the scene with his family and his close ally John White, ending his spell in charge on the Shankill. Several weeks later McDonald organised a "battle of the bands" (competition between loyalist flute bands) at which he made it clear that unity had been re-established. He then received a standing ovation from those present as, marching behind a masked man carrying an AK 47, McDonald led the other five brigadiers onto the stage.
When asked by Peter Taylor whether he had any regrets about his past involvements, McDonald replied:"I have certainly. I would say without a shadow of doubt the worst thing that ever happened to South Belfast, John McMichael and myself especially, was that Jim Craig ever had anything to do with our organisation."
Subsequent activity.
McDonald remains a member of the UDA's Inner Council and is also the spokesman for its political advisory body, the Ulster Political Research Group (UPRG). Politically he always considered former Ulster Democratic Party (UDP) spokesman Davy Adams to be his main political advisor. He has in recent years turned his attention to community-building activities and helping former loyalist prisoners as a full-time organiser of the "John McMichael Centre" in Belfast's Sandy Row district, named after his deceased friend and former comrade.
Beginning in 2003, McDonald has held peace talks with Irish president Mary McAleese and her husband Martin. In 2004, he was part of a loyalist delegation which met with Taoiseach Bertie Ahern in Dublin.
In 2010, to the surprise of many people, he stated that the Orange Order should walk away from the Garvaghy Road dispute unless the residents of the contentious parade route give their consent for the march to take place. He also criticised republicans and Sinn Féin for manipulating the parades issue.
McDonald met Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams in person for the first time in June 2010, although the two had spoken previously over the telephone. The meeting, which went well, took place at the family home of Harry Haggan, a loyalist community worker who had just died. McDonald and Adams had both called at the Haggan home to offer their condolences to the deceased man's family.
On 18 May 2011, McDonald led a delegation of UDA brigadiers to the ceremony at the Irish National War Memorial Gardens in Islandbridge, Dublin where Queen Elizabeth II laid a wreath during her three-day visit to the Republic of Ireland. McDonald, who said he was proud and felt honoured to have participated in the event made the following statements to the "Irish Times":"It shows that there is a relationship and an association between Northern Ireland and the Republic. People need to be aware of the similarities and the sacrifices, especially in the wars. I think it is a time for them to come together and appreciate each other's pasts and give ourselves all a better future. I always thought "The Troubles" would never end in my lifetime, and in many ways they still haven't really, but there is a kind of peace. We need to build on that." 
He travels on a Republic of Ireland passport.
His picture and details were published on far right website Redwatch when he attended an anti-racist protest in 2009.
Commenting on Martin McGuinness running for election in the Irish presidential election, 2011, McDonald stated that Unionists had nothing to fear from it and any Unionist that opposed it was hypocritical.
In October 2011 after accepting an invitation to attend an event in Belfast City Hall to unveil a new portrait of famous Irish republican and trade union leader James Connolly he was later forced to withdraw his attendance at the event. The reason for the withdrawal was attributed to an angry backlash from senior UDA leaders angry at the Sinn Féin mayor of Belfast Niall Ó Donnghaile's decision to remove photos of the Royal Family from his office.
Criticising young loyalists in November 2011, he suggested they were too interested in drinking alcohol and using drugs than caring about their future. In a further verbal attack, he lambasted some loyalist band members for attacking each other when drunk and when there are no Catholics in the vicinity.
To some surprise McDonald in 2012 labelled The Twelfth as "the worst day of my year". He cited the excess consumption of alcohol by followers and supporters of the parades in Belfast causing violence on occasions. He also noted that if the parades had an outward route only without having a return route the potential for disorder would be decreased. The comments were condemned by other loyalists and were said to have driven a further wedge between the wider UDA and its North Antrim and Londonderry Brigade, which had been the source of some dissident activity.
McDonald is the most senior UDA brigadier, and author Jon Moran credits him with restoring order to the organisation due to his prominent role in bringing about the downfall of Johnny Adair. He and the South Belfast Brigade have long taken a hard-line stance against drugs and drug-dealing in south Belfast. He confirmed this is an interview with Ian S. Wood: "We do take as hard a line as we can in South Belfast".

International Independent Group of Eminent Persons

The International Independent Group of Eminent Persons, abbreviated to IIGEP, was a group of individuals nominated by international donor countries and the government of Sri Lanka, vested with a wide mandate to observe all investigations and inquiries conducted by and on behalf of the Commission of Inquiry into alleged human rights abuses in Sri Lanka. The following individuals were members of the IIGEP:
Mandate.
The mandate of the IIGEP has come under criticism [http://www.humanitarian-srilanka.org/CKC/DailyInfo/CPA%20on%20Commission%20of%20Inquiry%20and%20IIGEP.pdf from several human rights organisations, underlining its inherent weaknesses, including:
IIGEP did not have independent access to witnesses or conduct independent investigations, and the Commission of Inquiry early indicated that IIGEP were to observe and not investigate. The reports of the IIGEP where submitted to the President, who has the power to veto publication of information sensitive to national security - this is seen as especially disturbing given that Sri Lankan armed forces have been implicated in several of the killings that are to be investigated by the Commission of Inquiry. None of IIGEPs reports to the President have been publicized so far.
Resignation.
The members of IIGEP at their November 2007 plenary concluded that they would terminate the IIGEP observation role with effect from April 1, 2008 and informed President Mahinda Rajapakse of their decision. In their concluding public statement, they outlined that they did not see that continued observation would change the situation, and that despite IIGEP drawing attention to defects in the workings of the Commission, their recommendations have been largely disregarded.
In an IIGEP press briefing on April 22, 2008, three members of the IIGEP clarified matters relating to their resignation. Sir Nigel Rodley characterized some of the communications to the IIGEP, including to its chairman as 'very disrespectful', and added that the latest AG response to the April 14th IIGEP public statements contained baseless allegations that the IIGEP were working according to a secret agenda in order to force UN Human Rights Monitoring onto Sri Lanka in defiance of Sri Lankas sovereignty. The IIGEP Chairman, P.N. Bhagwati, outlined that the allegations that the IIGEP did not understand the Sri Lankan legal system were irrelevant, as IIGEPs mandate calls for the group to comment on whether the proceedings conform to international standards, not Sri Lankan standards. Professor Yozo Yokota reminded the press corps that, contrary to government statements, the IIGEP is not a European group, but consists of experts from all over the world.
Main findings.
The main concerns of the IIGEP were:
Government response.
The Government of Sri Lanka responded to the resignation of the members of the IIGEP both formally through a response drafted by the Attorney General, where the AG argues that the IIGEP cannot terminate its existence but merely resign, and that the President then can nominate new Eminent Persons to carry on the task.

Robert Koch Prize

The Robert Koch Medal and Award are two prizes awarded annually for excellence in the biomedical sciences. These awards grew out of early attempts by Robert Koch to generate funding to support his research into the cause and cure for tuberculosis. Koch discovered the bacteria ("Mycobacterium tuberculosis") responsible for the dreaded disease and rapidly acquired international support, including 500,000 gold marks from the Scottish-American philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. 
The Koch Prize.
Since 1970, the Koch Foundation has awarded prizes for major advances in the biomedical sciences, particularly in the fields of microbiology and immunology. The prestige of this award has grown over the past decades so that it is now widely regarded as the leading international scientific prize in microbiology. As has been described by a jury member for the prize, the committee often asks, What would Robert Koch work on today?” to decide on research that should be granted recognition. 
The more specific Koch Prize is commonly considered one of the stepping-stones (along with other prizes such as the Lasker Award) to eventual Nobel Prize recognition for scientists in the fields of microbiology and immunology, and a number of Koch Prize winners subsequently became Nobel laureates, such as César Milstein, Susumu Tonegawa and Harald zur Hausen. Other notable awardees include Albert Sabin, Jonas Salk and John Enders for their pioneering work on the development of polio vaccines. Only Enders was recognized with a Nobel Prize, together with Thomas Huckle Weller and Frederick Chapman Robbins. 
Two separate Robert Koch Awards are presented annually: The Gold Koch Medallion for accumulated excellence in biomedical research and the Koch Prize, €100,000, for a major discovery in biomedical science.

Vasilije "Čiko" Radović (born September 10, 1938) is a former Yugoslav football goalkeeper and manager. He was born in Montenegro, but he spent most of his life in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He started playing in FK Lovćen. During a friendly match with his team in 1957, FK Željezničar officials spotted him and decided to offer him to start playing for their club. He accepted the offer. He stayed in Željezničar for nine years and during this time he even became a candidate for Yugoslav national team. Since the competition was really good he collected only three caps. Many people were saying that he should play for some of the "Big four" clubs in order to gain a regular place on goal.
In 1966, he moved to Turkish side Fenerbahce SK. However, he returned to FK Željezničar after only one season in Turkish club. He played four more seasons until he decided to retire in 1971. because of an Achilles tendon injury. He played 307 official games for the club.
After retirement, he continued to work in football. He was a youth team coach in Željezničar and in 1976/1977 season he was a first team caretaker coach after Milan Ribar stepped down. He continued with the club in various front office roles after that. He is one of the meritorious ones for saving the club during the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Tataupa tinamou

The tataupa tinamou ("Crypturellus tataupa") is a type of tinamou commonly found in dry forest in subtropical and tropical regions in southeastern South America.
Etymology.
"Crypturellus" is formed from three Latin or Greek words: "kruptos" meaning covered or hidden, "oura" meaning tail, and "ellus" meaning diminutive. Therefore "Crypturellus" means small hidden tail.
Taxonomy.
All tinamou are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.
Subspecies.
The Tataupa tinamou has four subspecies as follows:

The tataupa tinamou is approximately in length. Its upper parts are dark brown, with a dark brown crown, a pale grey throat. It has darker grey on the sides of its head, neck, and breast, with a bu belly buff. Its bill and legs are purplish red.
Behavior.
Like other tinamous, the tataupa tinamou eats fruit off the ground or low-lying bushes. They also eat small amounts of invertebrates, flower buds, tender leaves, seeds, and roots. The male incubates the eggs which may come from as many as 4 different females, and then will raise them until they are ready to be on their own, usually 2–3 weeks. The nest is located on the ground in dense brush or between raised root buttresses.
Range and habitat.
The tataupa tinamou prefers dry forest up to altitude. It may also be found in lowland moist forest and degraded former forest habitats. This species is native to northeastern Brazil, eastern Bolivia, northern Argentina, Paraguay and western Peru in South America. It also has been sighted in extreme southern Ecuador.
Conservation.
The IUCN classifies this tinamou as Least Concern, with an occurrence range of .

Tyska Skolgränd

Tyska Skolgränd () is an alley in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden, stretching from Svartmangatan to Baggensgatan, and crossed by Själagårdsgatan.
The present name of the street, first appearing as "Tyska Scholæ Gatan" on a map from the early 18th century, is apparently derived from the German school in the late 16th century housed on number 8, Själagårdsgatan. The lot was thereafter bought by the German parish who had a first school building built in 1626, and a new completed in 1670. The building was subsequently enlarged and rebuilt at several occasions, the present buildings on the location mostly dating from 1887. The building, as it seem, was the one in general used by itinerant theatre groups in Stockholm during the 17th century. The German school was discontinued after more than 300 years, but a new German school, still in operation, was inaugurated on Östermalm in 1941.
The part of the alley east of Själagårdsgatan appears under different names reflecting the various activities dominating it: In 1557, it is called "Tynnebindare gaten" referring to a hooper (e.g. maker of barrels) "Peder Tunnbindare" ("Peter Barrel-binder") known to have lived here in 1538. Located on the north side of the alley was, however, the potent "Vårfrugillet av den tyska nationen" ("Our Lady's guild of the German Nation"), which gave the alley the name "Gillestugegaten" ("Guild's Cottage's Street") in 1579. During the 18th century, the alley is also referred to as "Persiljegränd" ("Parsley Alley"), possibly a corruption (jocular or not) of the name of the extended block east of the alley, "Perseus". Since the revision of street names in 1885, this alley is, however, made part of the western section.
Over the porch of Number 4 is a sandstone cartouche dating back to the 1670s and displaying the message: 
a Latin sentence meaning "As long as the school of the German parish prosper, conscientious studies will bring true honour". The Latin numbers in the sentence - an encrypted message - summon up to the year 1670.

Höga Kusten Airport

Höga Kusten Airport, translated "High Coast Airport", by authorities such as IATA and Transportstyrelsen known as Kramfors-Sollefteå Airport, is an airport located between the towns of Kramfors and Sollefteå, Sweden . The airport is still named Kramfors on tickets and flight lists on other airports.
The number of passengers in 2012 was 18,455, dropping sharply from 62,000 in 2000. The reason for this is low price flights from larger relatively nearby airports like Örnsköldsvik Airport and Sundsvall-Härnösand Airport (travel has not been reduced overall during this period, but the Kramfors passengers have to a large extent chosen other routes). The figures were only 14,787 in 2008 due to the bankruptcy of the airline Nordic Regional.
Transportation.
Ground transport is by taxi, shared taxi, rental car or own car.
There is (since August 2012) a railway station on the Ådalen Line 1½ km (1 mile) from the airport. Taxi transfer is available, which should be prebooked.

Torre della Ghirlandina

The Torre della Ghirlandina or simply Ghirlandina is the bell tower of the Cathedral of Modena, in Emilia-Romagna, Italy.
Standing at 86.12 metres, the tower is the traditional symbol of Modena, being visible from all directions outside the city.
The structure was set up in 1179 on five floors, initially called "Torre di San Geminiano". To compete with Bologna's towers, the commune added the characteristic octagonal cusp, designed by Arrigo da Campione, one of the numerous masters from Campione who took part in the cathedral's renovation in the 13th-15th centuries. The top of the tower is decorated with two "ghirlande" (two marble railings), whence the name.
In the interior, the "Sala della Secchia" room (with 15th-century frescoes) is home of a copy of the depiction of the "Secchia rapita", a memory of the tower's former role as treasury of the Modenese commune. Also notable are the sculpted capitals in the "Sala dei Torresani" hall, in the fifth floor.
The five bells are tuned in C major, casted during reinassance perioud.
Restoration.
Currently the tower is undergoing restoration: it started in December 2007 and should be finished by the end of 2010. During the work, the scaffolding will be hidden behind an artistic screen painted by the Italian sculptor Mimmo Paladino. This choice has caused perplexity in the town, given the high cost of the operation and the very idea of it.

Ivatan people

The Ivatans are a Filipino ethnolinguistic group predominant in the Batanes Islands of the Philippines. The origins of the Ivatans remained untraced among scholars. Ivatans were free before they were colonized by the Spaniards.
The culture of the Ivatans is partly influenced by the environmental condition of Batanes. Unlike the old-type nipa huts common in the Philippines, Ivatans have adopted their now-famous stone houses made of limestone, designed to protect against the hostile climate.
Origins.
Documents do not show much about the history of the Ivatans and at present, scholars who study their origins are still unsure as to their exact origin. They question whether the pre-historic Ivatans came from the northern part of Luzon or southern portions of China and Taiwan. There is evidence that they might be a surviving Christianized remnant of a people that once resided on all the islands between Luzon and Taiwan. However, they have considered the close racial resemblance of the Ivatans to the Malays and the structure of their language could mean they came from other parts of the Philippines. Tracing their roots through Batanes' folklores, genetic studies of Omoto, a Japanese anthropologist, of the Yami of Orchid Island ("Lanyu") show closer genetic affinity of the Yami to the Tagalog and Visayan and linguistically to the Batanic (Bashiic) sub-branch of the Malayo-Polynesian branch.
Early settlement.
Ivatans already lived in Batanes before the Spaniards arrived in the Philippines in the 16th century, and lived autonomously long thereafter. On June 26, 1783 Batanes was incorporated to the Spanish East Indies. In 1571 the capital of the Spanish colony in the Philippines was established in Manila. In 1686, Ivatans were "forced" to settle in the lowlands of Batanes . The Ivatans were under Spanish rule for 115 years, and gained their independence on September 18, 1898. Ironically, June 6 is celebrated in Batanes as its founding day.
Physical attributes.
One of the earliest accounts of the Ivatan is that of the British buccaneer William Dampier in 1687. Dampier described them as "short, squat people; hazel eyes, small yet bigger than Chinese; low foreheads; thick eyebrows; short low noses; white teeth; black thick hair; and very dark, copper-colored skin." They also have strong mixture of the short type of the Mongols, and there are some individuals who seem to have some physical characteristics peculiar to the Ainus of Japan.
Demographics.
In 1990, population of the Ivatans was 15,026, an increase of 24% over the 1980 population of 12,091. These were distributed to the six municipalities, with 38% residing in Basco, 23% in Itbayat, 12% in Sabtang, 11% in Mahatao and 8% for Uyugan and Ivana. In the 2000 census, 15,834 Ivatans were among the 16,421 population in Batanes.
The mother tongue of the Ivatans is the "Chirin nu Ibatán", but is commonly known as Ivatan. A distinct Austronesian language, the Ivatan has two dialects including the "Basco", the "Ibayáten" and possibly the Yami. The Ivatans widely speak and understand the Tagalog and English languages.
Today, most Ivatans are Catholics, like the rest of the country, although some have not converted practice ancestral worship to their "anitos". However, there are growing Christian denominations specially in the capital town of Batanes.
Culture.
The Ivatan's culture have been largely influenced by the climate of Batanes. Exposed to high risks of disruption to their agriculture, Ivatans have adopted strategies in order to live. Traditionally, because of the frequent typhoons and drought, they plant root crops able to cope with the environment. These crops include yam, sweet potato, taro, garlic, ginger and onion, as they ensure higher chances of survival during awry climate conditions. The Ivatan study the behavior of animals, sky color, wind and clouds to predict the weather. The Ivatans usually gather their animals and stay in their houses when they see that the cows take shelter from the "payaman" (communal pasture) and birds taking refuge in houses or in the ground. A pink sky with an orange hue also heralds a storm. The sea is vital to the Ivatan's way of life. Although abundant only in the month of March to May, they depend on the flying fish (dibang) and dolphinfish (arayu) present on the shores of Batanes. They have a native delicacy called "uvod" (the pith of the banana stalk) which is served, along with the wine "palek", on festive occasions such as weddings.
Before Spaniards arrived at the Philippines, Ivatans built their houses largely from cogon grass, small and well situated, designed to protect against strong winds. The Spaniards introduced large-scale production of lime for the construction of their now-famous stone houses. With meter-thick limestone walls, the type of their infrastructures are designed against the harsh Batanes environment, which is known as a terminal passage of typhoons in the Philippines. The basic cogon grass is still preserved as roofs of their houses, thickly constructed to withstand strong winds. These houses are comparable to the white houses in New Zealand, Ireland and Scottish Highlands.
One of the endemic clothing of the Ivatans is the "vakul". A "vakul" is a headgear designed to protect the wearer from sun and rain. It is made from abaca fiber of the "vuyavuy" palm.
The Ivatan have three different folk songs: the "laji", the "kanta" and the "kalusan". The "laji" are ancient lyrical songs that are supposed to be sung when they are merry or just finished work. The "kalusan" on the other hand is sung during work. The Ivatan also have legends that are called "kabbata". They also have the "rawod", chants that chronicle the adventures of the Ivatan's forefathers as they escape a disaster.

Armenian cemetery in Julfa

The Armenian cemetery in Julfa (, "Jughayi gerezmanots") was a medieval-era cemetery near the town of Julfa (known as Jugha in Armenian), Nakhchivan, an exclave of the Republic of Azerbaijan that originally housed around 10,000 funerary monuments. The tombstones consisted mainly of thousands of "khachkars", uniquely decorated cross-stones characteristic of medieval Christian Armenian art. The cemetery was still standing in the late 1990s, when the government of Azerbaijan began a systematic campaign to destroy the monuments. 
Several appeals were filed by both Armenian and international organizations, condemning the Azerbaijani government and calling on it to desist from such activity. In 2006, Azerbaijan barred European Parliament members from investigating the claims, charging them with a "biased and hysterical approach" to the issue and stating that it would only accept a delegation if it visited Armenian-controlled territory as well. In the spring of 2006, a journalist from the Institute for War and Peace Reporting who visited the area reported that no visible traces of the cemetery remained. In the same year, photographs taken from Iran showed that the cemetery site had been turned into a military firing range. 
After studying and comparing satellite photos of Julfa taken in 2003 and 2009, in December 2010 the American Association for the Advancement of Science came to the conclusion that the cemetery was demolished and leveled.
History.
Nakhchivan is an exclave which belongs to Azerbaijan. Armenia's territory separates it from the rest of Azerbaijan. The exclave also borders Turkey and Iran. Lying near the Araks River, in the historical province of Syunik' in the heart of the Armenian plateau, Jugha gradually grew from a village to a city during the late medieval period. In the 16th century, it boasted a population of 20-40,000 Armenians who were largely occupied with trade and craftsmanship. The oldest khachkars found at the cemetery at Jugha, located in the western part of the city, dated to the 9th to 10th centuries but their construction, as well as that of other elaborately decorated grave markers, continued until 1605, the year when Shah Abbas I of Safavid Persia instituted a policy of scorched earth and ordered the town destroyed and all its inhabitants removed.
In addition to the thousands of khachkars, Armenians also erected numerous tombstones in the form of rams, which were intricately decorated with Christian motifs and engravings. According to the French traveler Alexandre de Rhodes, the cemetery still had 10,000 well-preserved khachkars when he visited Jugha in 1648. However, many khachkars were destroyed from this period onward to the point that only 5,000 were counted standing in 1903–1904.
Destruction.
Background.
Armenia first brought up charges against the Azerbaijani government for destroying khachkars in 1998 in the town of Julfa. Several years earlier, Armenia had supported the Armenians of Karabakh to fight for their independence in the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan, in the Nagorno-Karabakh War. The war concluded in 1994 when a cease fire was signed between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh established the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, an internationally unrecognized but "de facto" independent state. Since the end of the war, enmity against Armenians in Azerbaijan has built up. Sarah Pickman, writing in "Archaeology", noted that the loss of Nagorno-Karabakh to the Armenians has "played a part in this attempt to eradicate the historical Armenian presence in Nakhchivan."
In 1998, Azerbaijan dismissed Armenia's claims that the khachkars were being destroyed. Arpiayr Petrosyan, a member of the organization Armenian Architecture in Iran, had initially pressed the claims after having witnessed and filmed bulldozers destroying the monuments.
Hasan Zeynalov, the permanent representative of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic (NAR) in Baku, stated that the Armenian allegation was "another dirty lie of the Armenians." The government of Azerbaijan did not respond directly to the accusations but did state that "vandalism is not in the spirit of Azerbaijan." Armenia's claims provoked international scrutiny that, according to Armenian Minister of Culture Gagik Gyurdjian, helped to temporarily stop the destruction.
Armenian archaeologists and experts on the khachkars in Nakhchivan stated that when they first visited the region in 1987, prior to the breakup of the Soviet Union, the monuments had stood intact and the region itself had as many as "27,000 monasteries, churches, khachkars, tombstones" among other cultural artifacts. By 1998, the number of khachkars was reduced to 2,700. The old cemetery of Julgha is known to specialists to have housed as many as 10,000 of these carved khachkar headstones, up to 2,000 of which were still intact after an earlier outbreak of vandalism on the same site in 2002. 
Renewed claims in 2003.
In 2003, Armenians renewed their protests, claiming that Azerbaijan had restarted the destruction of the monuments. On December 4, 2002, Armenian historians and archaeologists met and filed a formal complaint and appealed to international organizations to investigate their claims. Eyewitness accounts of the ongoing demolition describe an organized operation. In December 2005, Iranian Armenians documented more video evidence across the Araks river, which partially demarcates the border between Nakhchivan and Iran, stating that it showed Azerbaijani troops had finished the destruction of the remaining khachkars by using sledgehammers and axes.
International response.
Azerbaijan's government has faced a flurry of condemnation since the charges were first revealed. When the claims were first brought up in 1998, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) ordered that the destruction of the monuments in Julfa cease. The complaints also brought forward similar appeals to end the activity by the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS).
In reaction to the charges brought forward by Armenia and international organizations, Azerbaijan has asserted that Armenians had never existed in those territories. In December 2005, Zeynalov stated in a BBC interview that Armenians "never lived in Nakhchivan, which has been Azerbaijani land from time immemorial, and that's why there are no Armenian cemeteries and monuments and have never been any." Azerbaijan instead contends that the monuments were not of Armenian, but of Caucasian Albanian, origin. 
In regard to the destruction, according to the Azerbaijani Ambassador to the United States, Hafiz Pashayev, the videos and photographs that were introduced did not show the identity of the people nor display what they are actually destroying. Instead, the ambassador asserts that the Armenian side started a propaganda campaign against Azerbaijan to draw attention away from the alleged destruction of Azerbaijani monuments in Armenia. Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev also denied the charges, calling them "a lie and a provocation."
In 2006, European parliamentary members protested to the Azerbaijani government when they were barred from inspecting the cemetery. Hannes Swoboda, an Austrian socialist MEP and committee member who was denied access to the region, commented that "If they do not allow us to go, we have a clear hint that something bad has happened. If something is hidden we want to ask why. It can only be because some of the allegations are true." Doctor Charles Tannock, a conservative member of the European Parliament for Greater London, and others echoed those sentiments and compared the destruction to the Buddha statues destroyed by the Taliban in Bamyan, Afghanistan in 2001. He cited in a speech a British architect, Steven Sim, an expert of the region, who attested that the video footage shot from the Iranian border was genuine.
Azerbaijan barred the European Parliament because it said it would only accept a delegation if it visited Armenian-controlled territory as well. "We think that if a comprehensive approach is taken to the problems that have been raised," said Azerbaijani foreign ministry spokesman Tahir Tagizade, "it will be possible to study Christian monuments on the territory of Azerbaijan, including in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic."
Both Azerbaijan and Armenia are members of the Council of Europe. After several postponed visits, a renewed attempt was planned by inspectors of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe for August 29 - September 6, 2007, led by the British Labour politician Edward O'Hara. As well as Nakhchivan, the delegation planned to visit Baku, Yerevan, Tbilisi, and Nagorno Karabakh. The inspectors planned to visit Nagorno-Karabakh via Armenia, and had arranged transport to facilitate this. However, on August 28, the head of the Azerbaijani delegation to PACE released a demand that the inspectors must enter Nagorno Karabakh via Azerbaijan. On August 29, PACE Secretary General Mateo Sorinas announced that the visit had had to be canceled, because of the difficulty in accessing Nagorno-Karabagh using the route required by Azerbaijan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Armenia issued a statement saying that Azerbaijan had stopped the visit "due solely to their intent to veil the demolition of Armenian monuments in Nakhijevan."
The government of Iran expressed concern over the destruction of the monuments and filed a protest with the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic's government (NAR).
In April 2011, the newly appointed United States ambassador to Azerbaijan Matthew Bryza visited Nakhchivan but was inexplicably refused access to Julfa by Azerbaijani authorities. Bryza had intended to investigate the cemetery but instead was told by government authorities that they would help facilitate a new trip in the coming months. In a statement released by the US embassy in Baku, Bryza stated that "As I said at the time the cemetery destruction was reported, the desecration of cultural sites – especially a cemetery – is a tragedy, which we deplore, regardless of where it happens."
In response to the statement, Aram Hamparian, the executive director of the Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA), called the ambassador's comments "Far too little, five years too late" and criticized him for not speaking out more forcefully and earlier against the destruction while he was still United States Deputy Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs in 2006.
Other.
Numerous non-Armenian scholars condemned the destruction and urged the Azerbaijan government to give a more complete account of its activities in the region. Adam T. Smith, an anthropologist and associate professor of anthropology at the University of Chicago, called the removal of the khachkars "a shameful episode in humanity's relation to its past, a deplorable act on the part of the government of Azerbaijan which requires both explanation and repair." Smith and other scholars, as well as several United States Senators, signed a letter to UNESCO and other organizations condemning Azerbaijan's government.
2010 AAAS analysis of satellite photos.
As a response to Azerbaijan barring on-site investigation by outside groups, on December 8, 2010, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) released an analysis of high-resolution satellite photographs of the Julfa cemetery site taken in 2003 and 2009. The AAAS concluded that the satellite imagery was consistent with the reports from observers on the ground, that "significant destruction and changes in the grade of the terrain" had occurred between 2003 and 2009, and that the cemetery area was "likely destroyed and later leveled by earth-moving equipment."

Valter Roman

Valter or Walter Roman (October 9, 1913 – November 11, 1983), born Ernst or Ernő Neuländer, was a Romanian communist activist and soldier. During his lifetime, Roman was active inside the Romanian, Czechoslovakian, French, and Spanish Communist parties as well as being a Comintern cadre. He started his military career as a volunteer in the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War, and rose to prominence in Communist Romania, as a high-level politician and military official.
Valter was the father of Petre Roman, a post-1989 politician, who served as Prime Minister.
Biography.
Early life.
Born in Nagyvárad (today Oradea, in Austria-Hungary at the time), he was the child of Jewish parents whose first language was Hungarian. In later testimonies, he indicated that his ethnic background was not entirely relevant to him: "Germans said I was a Hungarian, Hungarians that I was Romanian, Romanians said that I was Jewish, but Jews said I was a communist, although I was not yet one at the time".
Roman obtained a degree in Electrical engineering in Brno, Czechoslovakia.
Military career.
Initially active inside the PCR's agitprop section, he was a volunteer in a Romanian artillery unit of the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War ("see also Jewish volunteers in the Spanish Civil War") — according to one source, it was then that he first adopted the name "Valter Roman", while also using the pseudonym "G. Katowski". Wounded twice during combat, Roman eventually left for the Soviet Union.
In 1938-1941, Roman worked at a plane factory in Kalinin, later for one of the Comintern sections, and, during World War II, for an Institute for Scientific Research (1941–1945). During the period, he married Hortensia Vallejo, who was originally from Santander, Spain.
At the time, Roman also headed the Romanian-language radio station of the Comintern ("România Liberă"), broadcasting propaganda against the regime of Ion Antonescu and Romania's actions on the Eastern Front as an ally of Nazi Germany ("see Romania during World War II"). He returned to Soviet-occupied Romania in July 1945, as the political commissar for the Soviet-organized Horia, Cloşca şi Crişan Division, commanded by General Mihail Lascăr.
Under the communist regime, Roman became a general in the Romanian Army (Major General after May 1, 1948) with political responsibilities (Chief of the Army Directorate for Education, Culture, and Propaganda, 1946; Chief of the Superior Political Direction of the Romanian Army and Chief of Staff, 1947–1951), and Minister of Telecommunications (March 29, 1951-January 24, 1953). At the time, he declared himself in favor of recruiting a new military force "from the ranks of the working class, of the toiling peasantry and of the progressive intelligentsia".
Close to the Ana Pauker "Muscovite wing" of the PCR, he came into conflict with the party leadership around Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. Initially removed from his Army position in 1950, at the same time as all cadres who had fought in the International Brigades or the French Resistance, Roman was deposed from government office, purged from the PCR and Army on charges of "Titoism" and "espionage", and singled out for a possible show trial (1952). He became subject to daily interrogations by the Party Control Commission.
Pressures on him were relaxed after the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, and Roman became head of Editura Politică (1954–1983). He remained a suspect at a time when Gheorghiu-Dej felt increasingly threatened, was subject to a "vote of censure" in 1954, and was completely rehabilitated only in 1956.
Party leadership.
In 1956 and 1957, as a high-ranking member of the Communist Party, Valter Roman was involved in deciding Romanian policies in regard to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, which threatened to spark similar actions in Romania. He spent late October in Budapest, sending back reports which inflamed sentiments by presenting alleged revolutionary violence. After the Red Army invaded Hungary, he accompanied Gheorghiu-Dej, the writer Mihai Beniuc, and other local Communists to Budapest, where the three of them reviewed the situation and expressed approval of Soviet policies. Later on, he was involved in interrogating Imre Nagy during his detainment in Snagov, while also ensuring contacts between Nagy and Soviet officials. Nagy was returned to Hungary, secretly tried and executed. According to Fedor Burlatsky, Nikita Khrushchev had Nagy executed, "as a lesson to all other leaders in socialist countries."
An associate of Leonte Răutu, Roman seconded Emil Bodnăraş in the 1959 process of writing and compiling Party history, with a mission to highlight both Gheorghiu-Dej's role in the 1944 toppling of Ion Antonescu's regime and the insurrectional character of the coup.
In 1961, he was among the Party leaders who spoke out against Iosif Chişinevschi and other former leaders who had been since marginalized, such as Pauker (whom he accused of having maintained contacts with Soviet police chief Lavrentiy Beria), Boris Stefanov, and Lucreţiu Pătrăşcanu. He also rallied with Gheorghiu-Dej's positive views on de-Stalinization, claiming that Pauker's fall had been a sign of Romania parting with Stalinism. At the time, he argued that Pauker and her collaborator Vasile Luca had viewed him with suspicion based on his participation in the Spanish Civil War.
After Gheorghiu-Dej's death, he approved of the change in course indicated by Nicolae Ceauşescu, and joined in condemning the 1968 Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia (at the time, he notably quoted Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea's statement that "socialism and truth are inseparable"). Elected to the Central Committee on July 24, 1965, he was in office until his death.
Decorated a "Hero of the Socialist Labor", Roman was also employed as a University professor. By the 1970s, he was becoming opposed to the Ceauşescu leadership and questioned Leninism itself; a diary entry of 1975 shows that he resented the massive enrollment of obedient cadres into the PCR, and speculated that "when Lenin elaborated the concept of the new-type party he took inspiration from, he also thought of Ignacio de Loyola, of his «company of Jesus», of what it represented from the point of view of discipline, of obedience, hence there later emerged many negative consequences and, first of all, the deterioration of human character, of human integrity".
Controversies.
Several aspects of Roman's past remain under dispute.
In 2000, investigations by Russian historian Tofik Islamov concluded that, after Soviet authorities charged Maxim Litvinov to investigate the issue of Northern Transylvania, disputed between Romania and Hungary, Roman approached the commission in late 1944 with plans to have Transylvania declare itself independent (under a common guarantee from the Soviets and Western Allies). Petre Roman has repeatedly contested the conclusion, advancing documents which, he argued, proved that his father was in favor of Transylvania's status inside Romania. 
In his own reply to Petre Roman's arguments, Islamov repeated his statements, and contended that views such as those attributed to Valter Roman were commonplace among internationalists of the time. He also cited Valter Roman's own 1944 statement — according to the document, Roman viewed both Hungary and Romania as guilty of waging war on the Soviet Union, arguing that the region (Transylvania) was "an ethnographic conglomerate" with a tradition of regional sovereignty, economic independence, and status as "the most progressive part of the country". 
In 2006, Petre Roman was involved in a polemic with former Securitate chief and defector Ion Mihai Pacepa over the extent to which Valter Roman took part in political repression in the wake of the Hungarian Revolution.

Le Batteur Du Boléro

Le Batteur du Boléro is a short film by Patrice Leconte, released in 1992. It features a drummer in an orchestra, played by Jacques Villeret, who plays a simple, repetitive rhythm on his single drum during a performance of Maurice Ravel's Boléro. 
The focal point of the film is the drummer’s facial expressions. He has a bland expression at first, but as the film develops, he starts twitching his eyes, mouth and eyebrows. This technique is used to show the performer's frustration with the monotony of the piece. When the drummer’s mind is elsewhere, he starts to get out of rhythm. He shows his discomfort by twitching, indicating that his back hurts, and his continuous muttering.
When a female timpanist starts her part, he looks enviously at her and mutters every time he looks back at her. “Displeasure at being overshadowed by a bigger drum,” the director comments on the commentary.
The film was screened out of competition at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival.

Parti de la Democratie Socialiste

The Parti de la démocratie socialiste (PDS; ) was a political party in Quebec, Canada.
The PDS' roots can be traced to 1939, with the founding of the Fédération du Commonwealth Coopératif (FCC), later renamed Parti social démocratique du Québec (PSD; Social Democratic Party) in 1955. The FCC/PSD was the Quebec counterpart of the Canadian Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF).
After the CCF became the New Democratic Party in 1961, the Quebec wing was re-founded as the New Democratic Party of Quebec (Nouveau Parti démocratique du Québec, NPDQ). The NPDQ contested Quebec general elections in 1970, 1976, 1985, 1989 and 1994. The NPDQ was separated from the federalist NDP in 1989. A new branch of the federal NDP, called New Democratic Party of Canada - Québec Section was refounded in 1990, and is active only in federal politics.
The NPDQ's ties to the federal NDP were finally severed in 1991 as a result of the provincial party's endorsement of the Bloc Québécois in a 1990 by-election. It was encouraged to change its name and became the "Parti de la démocratie socialiste" in 1995, and as such contested the 1998 Quebec election.
In 2002, the PDS became a part of the left-wing coalition Union des forces progressistes (UFP; Union of Progressive Forces), together with the Rassemblement pour l'alternative progressiste (RAP; Union for a Progressive Alternative) and the Communist Party of Quebec. As a consequence, the PDS withdrew its official party registration with the chief electoral officer and participated under the UFP banner in the Quebec general election of 2003. In 2006 the UFP merged with Option citoyenne to form Québec solidaire. It remains an organized tendency within the new coalition under the name "Québec socialiste".

Jack McMurray, Sr.

Jack McMurray Senior (21 September 1889 – 16 July 1988) was a leading Australian rules football field umpire in the Victorian Football League (VFL) in the early twentieth century.
Footballer.
McMurray was born in Port Melbourne, Victoria in 1889.
His father, Arch, played for Port Melbourne Football Club and South Melbourne Football Club during the 1880s. He also represented Victoria.
Jack showed a keen interest in football himself. He began umpiring in the South Suburban competition aged 16 but the next year decided that he wanted to play and joined the Rosedale juniors at Port Melbourne.
He found the going tough by virtue of his very slight physique (155 cm and 50 kg) and in 1908 he returned to umpiring and officiated in the Metropolitan Junior Association.
VFA Umpire.
Three years later, his progression found him umpiring in the Victorian Junior Association and in 1913 he was appointed to the Victorian Football Association (VFA). In 1914 he handled the First Semi-Final and two weeks later the Grand Final between North Melbourne and Footscray. In 1915 he umpired through the home and away season but could not dislodge Tom Kendall who umpired all three finals matches that year.
VFL Umpire.
With the VFA competition suspended during World War I, he moved to the rival Victorian Football League (VFL) (the VFL renamed Australian Football League (AFL) in 1991).
In 1917 he umpired his first match, Fitzroy versus Richmond, at the Brunswick Street Oval, on Monday 4 June 1917.
While his progression may have been slow he was building a wealth of experience that would serve him well in the highflying career that was to follow. He closely studied Jack Elder's technique and put into practice what he saw.
The breakthrough came in June 1920 when he umpired the rest of the season in the seniors and was a first choice umpire week in week out. His first matches of significance were in the 1921 finals series and he umpired three of the four finals that year, Jack Elder being appointed to the Second Semi-Final.
McMurray now established himself as 'the' umpire of the period, having almost a monopoly on finals, interstate and carnival matches. He was in charge of the first half of the only match ever between the VFL and VFA Premiers. Played in 1924, after a particularly unsuccessful League final series experiment [http://afl.com.au/Season2007/News/NewsArticle/tabid/208/Default.aspx?newsId=32977], Footscray defeated Essendon and McMurray shared duties with the VFA's representative James Leheny.
NTFA Umpire.
In 1929 the Great Depression led McMurray to accept an offer from the Northern Tasmanian Football Association (NTFA). He was appointed to umpire for £15 a week (at the time the highest fee ever paid).
Contemporary reports stated that his excellent decision making, consistency and strong control did much to improve the standard of play in Tasmania.
He returned to Melbourne at the end of the season and was immediately reappointed to the VFL for 1930.
Haydn Bunton.
One famous incident in McMurray's career involved the great Haydn Bunton Senior. In 1934, Bunton dominated the last game of the season and as he walked off the ground he made a flippant remark to the sole umpire, Jack McMurray, along the lines of: "That wasn't bad today, Jack."
"Never try to bribe an umpire," McMurray apparently replied - and left him out of the votes. Bunton lost the medal to Dick Reynolds by one vote that season.[http://www.fitzroyfc.com.au/article_finest_lion_of_all_Haydn_Bunton.htm]
Senior career.
In August 1936, 20 seasons after his first VFL match, McMurray became the first umpire to officiate in 300 VFL matches. He eventually retired from VFL umpiring at the end of that season having umpired a total of 307 matches (including 4 as a boundary umpire), 23 finals (including 5 Grand Finals) and a record 15 Interstate appointments.
He umpired one final season in the country leagues and at the end of 1937, aged 47, left the field for good.
Honours.
He was made a life-member of the League in 1980 matching his 1933 Life Membership of the VFL Umpires Association. McMurray was further recognised by the awarding of the Jack McMurray Scholarships. These were presented to the best two first year umpires on the Cadet Squad list each year between and 1987 and 1991 by the then VFL Commission.
McMurray was inducted to the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996.
His son, Jack McMurray Junior, was also a highly respected umpire, inducted into the Hall of Fame.

Nkechi Ka Egenamba (first name pronounced n-kay-chee) known as Ninja is an English rapper and the female lead vocalist for the British indie band The Go! Team. Doing a mixture of rapping, chanting and singing, Ninja is well known for her energetic stage performances and dancing. In 2005, "NME" voted Ninja the 15th coolest person in music.
Early life and education.
Born Nkechi Ka Egenamba in 1983, Nkechi is short for Nkechinyere, and means "what God has given" or "gift of God" in Igbo, the language of the Igbo people, an ethnic group in West Africa, numbering in the tens of millions. Ninja is from London. Her father is Nigerian and a lawyer, and her mother is half-Egyptian, half-Nigerian. Ninja is one of five children and was brought up in a very strict household. She had been studying at the university before she joined The Go! Team.
The Go! Team.
Ninja became lead singer for the The Go! Team after founder Ian Parton created the first The Go! Team album in the studio. With Ninja, the live band became a "separate entity" to the original studio vision, as the performances became radically different from the recordings, particularly due to Ninja's freestyled vocals contrary to the sampled vocals present on the album. Parton acknowledged that Ninja had become the "face of the band" in an interview with Erik Leijon in September 2007.

Gastropod shell

The gastropod shell is a shell which is part of the body of a gastropod or snail, one kind of mollusc. The gastropod shell is an external skeleton or exoskeleton, which serves not only for muscle attachment, but also for protection from predators and from mechanical damage. In land snails, in some freshwater snails and in intertidal marine snails, the shell is also an essential protection against the sun, and against drying out.
Most gastropod shells are spirally coiled. The coiling is usually right-handed, but in some taxa the coiling is left-handed and in a very few species there can be both right-handed and left-handed individuals.
The gastropod shell has several layers, and is typically made of calcium carbonate precipitated out into an organic matrix known as conchiolin. The shell is secreted by a part of the molluscan body known as the mantle.
Some gastropods are shell-less (slugs), but the majority of gastropods do have a shell. In almost every case the shell consists of one piece, and is typically spirally coiled, although some groups, such as the various families and genera of limpets, have simple cone-shaped shells as adults.
The study of mollusc shells, including gastropod shells, is called conchology.
Chirality in gastropods.
Because coiled shells are asymmetrical, they possess a quality called chirality, the "handedness" of an asymmetrical structure.
By far the majority (over 90%) of gastropod species have dextral (right-handed) shells in their coiling, but a small minority of species and genera are virtually always sinistral (left-handed), and a very few species (for example "Amphidromus perversus") show an even mixture of dextral and sinistral individuals.
In species that are almost always dextral, very rarely a sinistral specimen will be produced, and these oddities are avidly sought after by some shell collectors.
If a coiled gastropod shell is held with the spire pointing upwards and the aperture more or less facing the observer, a dextral shell will have the aperture on the right-hand side, and a sinistral shell will have the aperture on the left-hand side.
This chirality of gastropods is often overlooked when photographs of coiled gastropods are "flipped" by a non-expert prior to being used in a publication. This image "flipping" results in a normal dextral gastropod appearing to be a rare and abnormal sinistral one.
The chirality in gastropods appears in early cleavage (spiral cleavage) and the gene NODAL is involved. A more recent study (2013) correlates the asymmetric coiling of the shell by the left-right asymmetric expression of the decapentaplegic gene in the mantle.
Mixed coiling populations.
In few cases, both left- and right-handed coiling are found in the same population. Sinistral mutants of normally dextral species and dextral mutants of normally sinistral species are rare but well documented occurrences among land snails in general. Populations or species with normally mixed coiling are much rarer, and, so far as is known, are confined, with one exception, to a few genera of arboreal tropical snails. Besides "Amphidromus", the Cuban "Liguus vittatus" (Swainson), Haitian "Liguus virgineus" (Linnaeus) (family Orthalicidae), some Hawaiian "Partulina" and many Hawaiian "Achatinella" (family Achatinellidae), as well as several species of Pacific Island "Partula" (family Partulidae), are known to have mixed dextral-sinistral populations. The independent appearance of this variation in unrelated groups is probably the result of a simple mutation, whose primary import is with physiological adaptations to arboreal life and not with the direction of coiling. In "Partula" both dextral and sinistral embryos have been recovered from the same brood pouch, although normally all embryos coil in the same direction. In "Amphidromus" there is no information on the heredity of this character.
A possible exception may concern some of the European clausiliids of the subfamily Alopiinae. They are obligatory calciphiles living in isolated colonies on limestone outcrops. Several sets of species differ only in the direction of coiling, but the evidence is inconclusive as to whether left- and right-handed shells live together. Soos (1928, pp. 372–385) summarized previous discussions of the problem and concluded that the right- and left-handed populations were distinct species. Others have stated that these populations were not distinct, and the question is far from settled. The Peruvian clausiliid, "Nenia callistoglypta" Pilsbry (1949, pp. 216–217), also has been described as being an amphidromine species.
The genetics of reverse coiling in a rare dextral mutant of another clausiliid, "Alinda biplicata" (Montagu), has been studied by Degner (1952). The mechanism is the same as in "Radix peregra" (Müller), with the direction of coiling determined by a simple Mendelian recessive. Any change in direction caused by cross-fertilization is delayed one generation by an unknown mechanism.
Morphology.
Gastropod shell morphology is usually quite constant among individuals of a species, and with exceptions, fairly constant among species within each family of gastropoda. Controlling variables are: 
Some of these factors can be modelled mathematically and programs exist to generate extremely realistic images. Early work by David Raup on the analog computer also revealed many possible combinations that were never adapted by any actual gastropod.
Some shell shapes are found more often in certain environments, though there are many exceptions. Wave-washed high-energy environments, such as the rocky intertidal zone, are usually inhabited by snails whose shells have a wide aperture, a relatively low surface area, and a high growth rate per revolution. High-spired and highly sculptured forms become more common in quiet water environments. The shell of burrowing forms, such as the olive and "Terebra", are smooth, elongated, and lack elaborate sculpture, in order to decrease resistance when moving through sand.
A few gastropods, for instance the Vermetidae, cement the shell to, and grow along, solid surfaces such as rocks, or other shells.
Standard ways of viewing a shell.
In photographs or illustrations, a gastropod shell can be shown oriented in a number of standard ways: 
Description.
The shell begins with the minute embryonic whorls of the protoconch, which is often quite distinct from the rest of the 
shell. From the protoconch, which forms the apex of the spire, the coils or whorls of the shell gradually increase in size. Normally the whorls are circular or elliptical in section, but from compression and other causes a variety of forms can result. The spire can be high or low, broad or slender according to the way the coils of the shell are arranged, and the apical angle of the shell varies accordingly. The whorls sometimes rest loosely upon one another (as in "Epitonium scalare"). They also can overlap the earlier whorls such that they may be largely or wholly covered by the later ones. When an angulation occurs, the space between it and the suture above it constitutes the area known as the "shoulder" of the shell. The shoulder angle may be simple or keeled, and may sometimes have nodes or spines.
The most primitive sculpture of the gastropod shell consists of revolving ridges or spirals, and of transverse folds or ribs. Primary spirals appear in regular succession on either side of the first primary, which generally becomes the shoulder angle if angulation occurs. Secondary spirals appear by intercalation between the primary ones, and generally are absent in the young shell, except in some highly accelerated types. Tertiary spirals are intercalated between the preceding groups in more specialized species. Ribs are regular transverse foldings of the shell, which generally extend from the suture to suture. They are usually spaced uniformly and crossed by the spirals. In specialized types, when a shoulder angle is formed, they become concentrated as nodes upon this angle, disappearing from the shoulder above and the body below. Spines may replace the nodes in later stages. They form as notches in the margin of the shell and are subsequently abandoned, often remaining open in front. Irregular spines may also arise on various parts of the surface of the shell (see "Platyceras"). When a row of spines is formed at the edge or outer lip of the shell this sometimes remains behind as a varix as in ("Murex") and many of the Ranellidae. Varices may also be formed by simple expansion of the outer lip, and a subsequent resumption of growth from the base of the expansion. These simple varices may project from the shell ("Epitonium") or be reflected backwards ("Harpa"). Periodic enlargements of ribs are not considered as varices.
The aperture or peristome of the shell may be simple or variously modified. An outer and an inner (columellar) lip are generally recognized. These may be continuous with each other, or may be divided below by an anterior notch. This, in some types ("Fusinus", etc.) it is drawn out into an anterior siphonal canal, of greater or lesser length.
An upper or posterior notch is present in certain taxa, and this may result in the formation of a ridge or shelf next to the suture ("Clavilithes"). An outer (lateral) emargination or notch, sometimes prolonged into a slit occurs in certain types (Pleurotomidae, Pleurotomaridae, Bellerophontidae, etc.), and the progressive closing of this slit may give rise to a definitely marked slit band. In some cases the slit is abandoned and left as a hole (Fissurellidae), or by periodic renewal as a succession of holes ("Haliotis"). The outer emargination is often only indicated by the reflected course of the lines of growth on the shell.
On the inside of the outer lip, various ridges or plications called lirae are sometimes found, and these occasionally may be strong and tooth-like ("Nerinea"). Similar ridges or columellar plicae or folds are more often found on the inner lip, next to the columella or central spiral twist. These may be oblique or normal to the axis of coiling (horizontal), few or numerous, readily seen, or far within the shell so as to be invisible except in broken shells. When the axis of coiling is hollow (perforate spire) the opening at the base constitutes the umbilicus. The umbilicus varies greatly in size, and may be wholly or in part covered by an expansion or callus of the inner lip ("Natica").
Many Recent shells, when the animal is alive or the shell is freshly empty, have an uppermost shell layer of horny, smooth, or hairy epidermis or periostracum, a proteinaceous layer which sometimes is thick enough to hide the color markings of the surface of the shell. The periostracum, as well as the coloration, is only rarely preserved in fossil shells.
The apertural end of the gastropod shell is the anterior end, nearest to the head of the animal; the apex of the spire is often the posterior end or at least is the dorsal side. Most authors figure the shells with the apex of the spire uppermost. 
In life, when the soft parts of these snail are retracted, in some groups the aperture of the shell is closed by using a horny or calcareous operculum, a door-like structure which is secreted by, and attached to, the upper surface of the posterior part of the foot. The operculum is of very variable form in the different groups of snails that possess one.
Parts of the shell.
The terminology used to describe the shells of gastropods includes:
Shape of the shell.
The distinction of the shape of the shell may vary, based on the purpose. For example distinguishing into three groups can be based on the height - width ratio:
The following are the principal modifications of form in the gastropod shell.
Detailed distinction of the shape can be:
Pear shape means both shapes: ovate-conic and conic.
Dimensions.
The most frequently used measurements of a gastropod shell are: the height of the shell, the width of the shell, the height of the aperture and the width of the aperture. The number of whorls is also often used.
In this context, the height (or the length) of a shell is its maximum measurement along the central axis. The width (or breadth, or diameter) is the maximum measurement of the shell at right angles to the central axis. Both terms are only related to the description of the shell and not to the orientation of the shell on the living animal.
The largest height of any shell is found in the marine snail species "Syrinx aruanus", which can be up to 91 cm.
The central axis is an imaginary axis along the length of a shell, around which, in a coiled shell, the whorls spiral. The central axis passes through the columella, the central pillar of the shell.
Evolutionary changes.
Among proposed roles invoked the variability of shells during evolution include mechanical stability, defense against predators (evolution of shells against external attacks has been proved by nanoindentation), sexual selection and climatic selection.
The shell of some gastropods have been reduced or partly reduced during the evolution. This reduction can be seen in all slugs, in semi-slugs and in various other marine and non-marine gastropods. Sometimes the reduction of the shell is associated with predatory way of feeding.
Some taxa even lost the coiling of their shell during evolution. According to Dollo's law, it is not possible to regain the coiling of the shell after it is lost. Despite that, there are few genera in the family Calyptraeidae that changed their developmental timing (heterochrony) and gained back (re-evolution) a coiled shell from the previous condition of an uncoiled limpet-like shell.
Taphonomic implications.
In large enough quantities, gastropod shells can have enough of an impact on environmental conditions to affect the ability of organic remains in the local environment to fossilize. For example, in the Dinosaur Park Formation, fossil hadrosaur eggshell is rare. This is because the breakdown of tannins from local coniferous vegetation would have caused the ancient waters to become acidic. Eggshell fragments are present in only two microfossil sites, both of which are predominated by the preserved shells of invertebrate life, including gastropods. It was the slow dissolution of these shells releasing calcium carbonate into the water that raised the water's pH high enough to prevent the eggshell fragments from dissolving before they could be fossilized.

Józef Czapski

Józef Czapski (April 3, 1896 — January 12, 1993) was a Polish artist, author, and critic, as well as an officer of the Polish Army. As a painter, he is notable for his membership in the Kapist movement, which was heavily influenced by Cézanne. Following the Polish Defensive War, he was made a prisoner of war by the Soviets and was among the very few officers to survive the Katyn massacre of 1940. Following the Sikorski-Mayski Agreement, he was an official envoy of the Polish government searching for the missing Polish officers in Russia. After World War II, he remained in exile in the Paris suburb of Maisons-Laffitte, where he was among the founders of "Kultura" monthly, one of the most influential Polish cultural journals of the 20th century.
Early life.
Józef Marian Franciszek hrabia Hutten-Czapski of Leliwa, as was his full name, was born April 3, 1896 in Prague, to an old aristocratic family of Hutten-Czapski. Among his relatives were hr. Emeryk Hutten-Czapski and Maria Czapska, as well as Georgy Chicherin. Czapski spent most of his childhood in his family's manor of Przyłuki near Minsk, where his father served as the tsarist governor. In 1915 he graduated from a gymnasium in St. Petersburg and joined the cadet corps. Czapski graduated from the law faculty of the University of Saint Petersburg, and in 1917 both joined and later resigned from the 1st Krechowce Uhlan Regiment, a Polish cavalry unit formed in Russia as part of the Polish I Corps. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917 he moved to newly-renascent Poland and in 1918 entered the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. There he started his studies in the class of Stanisław Lentz. However, already in 1920 he quit the academy and volunteered for the Polish Army.
Pacifism.
An ardent pacifist, Czapski asked for any service that would not involve active struggle. His plea was accepted and he was sent to Russia with a mission of finding the whereabouts of the officers of Czapski's former regiment, taken captive by the Bolsheviks in the course of the Russian Civil War. He reached St. Petersburg, where he met, among others, Dmitry Filosofov, Zinaida Gippius, Aleksey Remizov and Dmitry Merezhkovsky who later became his long-time friend. His mission was concluded when he found out that the officers had been executed by the Bolsheviks. Under Merezhkovsky's influence Czapski gave up his pacifist ideals and, upon his return to Poland, joined the ranks of the Polish Army and fought as a NCO in the crew of one of the armoured trains on the fronts of the Polish-Soviet War. For his merits he was awarded the Virtuti Militari, the highest Polish military decoration.
Art and writing.
In 1921, Czapski entered the Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków, where he was taught by Wojciech Weiss and Józef Pankiewicz. Moving away from the classical tradition, he moved to Paris in 1924 where he helped to develop the Komitet Paryski (Paris Committee, subsequently abbreviated to the 'Kapist' movement). Czapski began to hold exhibitions of his work but increasingly moved to becoming a critic, writing essays on art, literature, and philosophy. He returned to Poland in 1932, re-enlisting in 1939. He was subsequently captured by the Russians and held in prison and labour camps; he was one of 395 who avoided the fate of more than 20,000 murdered at Katyn and similar massacres.
After the 1941 German invasion of Russia and signing the Sikorski-Mayski Agreement, Czapski joined the Polish II Corps under the command of General Anders. Between 1941 and 1942, Czapski was tasked with investigating the disappearance of Poles who had been in the captivity of the NKVD and subsequently massacred. He never received any satisfactory answers as to the fate of these men, but wrote about his experiences in two books, "Reminiscences of Starobyelsk" (1944) and "The Inhuman Land" (1949). During that period Czapski also met Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy and Anna Akhmatova who is said to have dedicated one of her poems to him.
Anders subsequently removed his army through the Persian Corridor, and in Baghdad Czapski began writing for the Polish army newspapers "Orzeł Biały" ('White Eagle') and "Kurier Polski" ('Polish Courier'). He ended the war in Rome, and moved to France in 1946. Together with Gustaw Herling-Grudziński and Jerzy Giedroyc, he established the Instytut Literacki (Literary Institute) at Maisons-Laffitte, where he lived, and contributed to the Polish émigré literary journal 'Kultura'.
Czapski was awarded the Silver Cross of the Order of Virtuti Militari (1918–1920) and the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta (1990).
English translation.
"The Inhuman Land" is the only work of Czapski's translated into English and was published in London in 1951. Because it is a first-hand account of contemporaneous negotiations with the Soviets over the missing Polish officers it became an important document until Russian guilt for the massacres was acknowledged. In the post-war period Czapski was also among the eyewitnesses of the situation of Polish prisoners in Soviet captivity and testified on the matter before the United States Congress.

Roger Marche

Roger Marche (March 5, 1924 – November 1, 1997) was a French football (soccer) defender. He was part of the French national team during the 1954 and 1958 World Cup tournaments. He was nicknamed "Le Sanglier des Ardennes" ("the Boaer of the Ardenne") for the region from which he came.
Marche, born in Villers-Semeuse, Ardennes, is one of the players with the most appearances in the French top division, having played 542 matches for the clubs Stade Reims and RC Paris. 
He was a member of the French national team from 1947 to 1959, and became the most-capped player ever for France with 63 international matches played, surpassing Étienne Mattler's previous record of 46 caps set in 1940. Marche held the record until 1983, when the also defender Marius Trésor established a new mark with his 64th cap. Several players since have surpassed that cap total. 
Marche died in 1997 in Charleville-Mézières.
Trivia.
He scored his only international goal on December 17, 1959 against Spain in his very last match (the sixty-third) for France.

Ontario Highway 622

Secondary Highway 622, commonly referred to as Highway 622, is a long connecting route between Highways 11 and Highway 17 in Northwestern Ontario. The road is connected to Highway 11 by the 3 km-long spur road Highway 11B in Atikokan.
The road was built through the 1980s, with crews working from Highway 11 and Highway 17, meeting in the middle in 1988. It was opened to traffic in September 1989 and renumbered as Highway 622. During its construction, it was known as Bending Lake Road and was designated as Highway 807.
Route description.
Highway 622 is a long and desolate highway in northwestern Ontario that connects Highway 11 and Highway 17 via Highway 11B. Aside from Atikokan, at the southern end of the route, there are no communities, residences or establishments along the entire route. A handful of logging roads branch off the highway, but otherwise no through routes intersect it between its two termini. At its southern end, the route begins by branching off east from Highway 11B as it enters into Atikokan from the south. Highway 622 curves around the east side of the town then proceeds north into the wilderness. Between there and its northern terminus at Highway 17 between Dryden and Ignace, the route passes through a lake dotted region covered by rock and forest; the boreal forest and the Canadian Shield.
History.
In 1979, construction began on Bending Lake Road under the Northern Economic Development Program. Contracts were tendered for clearing the route from Highway 17 southerly and the existing Highway 622 northerly, as well as for the grading of of the route midway between the two. The southern end of this work was north of Highway 622. The latter job was completed by the following year. In 1980, work began on grading a new route from the end of an existing development road which branched off of Highway 622 north for , which was completed during the summer of 1981. In 1982, contracts were awarded for grading a road north from north of Highway 622.
By 1984, the remaining between the southern and middle sections were graded, and structures completed over the Seine River and Little Turtle River.
Contracts were awarded that year for construction of a structure over the Turtle River and for a further of grading from north of Highway 622 northerly. By the summer of 1985, of the road was graded and all three major river crossings completed.
Contracts were awarded to begin grading the route southerly from Highway 17, and for the installation of guide rails along the completed sections. The former of these two contracts was completed by the following summer, at which point another contract was tendered for grading another southward.
This was followed in 1987 with a contract for an additional of the northern section. Finally, in 1988, three contracts were tendered to complete the highway: the first was to grade the remaining of the route; the remaining two were to pave the entire route.
The highway was opened in September 1989.

<doc id="9769425" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9769425" title="Social perception">
Social perception

Social perception is the study of how people form impressions of and make inferences about other people. We learn about other's feelings and emotions by picking up on information we gather from their physical appearance, and verbal and nonverbal communication. Facial expressions, tone of voice, hand gestures, and body position are just a few examples of ways people communicate without words. A real world example of of social perception would be understanding that someone disagrees with what you said when you see them roll their eyes.
An important term to understand when talking about Social Perception is attribution. Attribution is being able to successfully identify a person's behavior based on the current context of the situation. For example, if you are at a wedding, you attribute everyone's happiness because getting married is a cause to celebrate. 
Most importantly, social perception is shaped by individual's motivation at the time, their emotions, and their cognitive load capacity. All of this combined determines how people attribute certain traits and how those traits are interpreted. 
Theories studied.
Attribution theory.
A large component of Social Perception is attribution. Attribution helps individuals understand and rationalize the behavior of others through the use of information gathered by observation. Psychological research into attribution began with the work of Fritz Heider in the early part of the 20th century, and subsequently developed by others such as Harold Kelley and Bernard Weiner. People make attributions to understand the world around them in order to seek reasons for a particular individual’s behavior. When people make attributions they are able to make judgments as to what was the cause of a certain behavior. However, a common mistake people make is called Fundamental Attribution Error. This means that the original explanation for the behavior was misidentified. An example of this would be a mother misattributing her son's excitement to sugar from the candy he just ate, as opposed to the real cause of his excitement being that his favorite TV show is on.
How do we attach meaning to other's behavior, or our own? This is called attribution theory. “Attribution theory deals with how the social perceiver uses information to explain events. It examines what information is gathered and how it is combined to form a causal judgment” (Fiske & Taylor, 1991). Attribution theory is concerned with how and why ordinary people explain events as they do.
Implicit personality theory.
Implicit personality theory is commonly associated with social perception because it identifies the biases we exhibit based on the limited information we know about unfamiliar people. Every day we interact with unfamiliar people and in those brief moments of interaction we pick up on the social cues presented and opinions are formed. Implicit Personality Theory states that people divide the personality traits of others into two groups: Central/Primary traits or Peripheral/Secondary traits. Central traits are the highly influential traits that have a strong impact on the overall impression of an individual. Peripheral traits are those produced and have smaller impact on the overall impression. 
Implicit personality theory helps explains social perception through the use of central and peripheral traits. When you are paying at the check out line at the grocery store and the cashier woman comes across as snappy and rude these are the central traits because we as customers want polite service. From that central trait, as you walk away with your groceries the peripheral traits, such as attractiveness or intelligence is tainted by her central trait of being rude. 
Implicit Personality Theory helps people to socially perceive others by generating a broader outlook on their personality using central and peripheral traits and use these traits to categorize people to predict their behavior. Social perception refers to the initial stages in which people process information in order to determine another individual’s mind-set and intentions. According to the implicit personality theory, people pay attention to a variety of cues, including visual, auditory, and verbal cues to predict and understand the personality of others. These help in filling in the gap of the unknown information about a person, which is key for social skills and social interactions. 
Testing.
TASIT (The Awareness of Social Inference Test) is an audiovisual test that was created for the clinical assessment of social perception. The test is based upon several critical components of social perception that are critical to social competence using complex, dynamic, visual, and auditory cues to assess these critical components. The test assesses the ability to identify emotions, a skill that is impaired in many clinical conditions. It also assesses the ability to judge what a speaker may be thinking or what their intentions are for the other person in the conversation, also referred to as Theory of Mind. Lastly, the test was developed to assess the ability to differentiate between literal and non-literal conversational remarks. The test is divided into three parts to measure; emotion, social inference – minimal, and social inference enriched. The test is composed of scenes, or vignettes, and those being assessed are asked to identify the emotions, a, feelings, beliefs, intentions, and meanings of the interactions. They are also assessed on more complex interactions to assess ability to interpret sarcasm. The results of this testing assess the level of social perception of an individual.
TASIT has adequate psychometric properties as a clinical test of social perception. It is not overly prone to practice effects and is reliable for repeat administrations. Performance on TASIT is affected by information processing speed, working memory, new learning and executive functioning, but the uniquely social material that comprises the stimuli for TASIT will provide useful insights into the particular difficulties people with clinical conditions experience when interpreting complex social phenomena.
Self concept.
According to Carl Rogers (1959), the self-concept is, "the organized, consistent set of perceptions and beliefs about oneself.” Each person has their own self-concept that reflects all of their personal attributes, beliefs and attitudes. In summary, a self-concept is the evaluation of one's self and the things that make up the self. The Development of the self-concept starts in early childhood. although how it develops and the distinct stages are still debated, Rogers(1959). Some of the most influential theories of the development of the self-concept come from M. Lewis, C. Rogers, E. Erikson, J. Brooks-Gunn and Jean Piaget.
Furthermore, one's self perception can also be influenced by the clothes that one wears. For instance, Hajo Adam found that when participants wore what they thought was a doctor's lab coat, they gained better attention skills.
Theories of the development of the self concept.
M. Lewis's existential and categorical selves.
Lewis (1990) believed that there were two key aspects of the self-concept; the existential self and the categorical self.
Lewis argued that the existential self is the most fundamental aspect of the self-concept. The existential self is the awareness of being your own unit separate from everything else. When children develop their existential selves they become aware of themselves as individuals, separate from all other things they can see around them. Children who have developed their existential selves can grasp the concept that they are continuous beings who will continue to exist despite changes across situations and environments. The existential self appears between two and three months of age. Lewis (1990) believes that the existential self may present so early because of the connection the child has to the world. For example, babies might notice that the TV screens change consistently yet the rooms the televisions are in, as well as they themselves, do not change.
Lewis described the categorical self as developing post-existential self once children gather an understanding of themselves as a separate entities in the world. The development of the categorical self allows children to identify themselves as having observable qualities and assets. A child will learn to identify her- or himself as a boy or a girl, or 2 years old versus three years old, qualities that can be experienced and that have specific aspects. At first, children only link basic and tangible qualities like age and gender. But as children grow older their categorical selves begin to include evaluations from others, comparisons and internal, psychological attributes. Lewis (1990).
Carl Roger's components of the self-concept.
Rogers (1959) took a humanistic approach to the self-concept. He argued that the self-concept is constructed from three different components that he called self-esteem (or self-worth), self-image and the ideal self. These three components of the self-concept are always unique and specific to each person. Rogers believed that we will evaluate our self-worth higher if our self-image and ideal-self are harmonious. When an individual acts in a way that is not fitting with the self-image, Roger's believes them to be in a ‘state of incongruence'.
Self-image.
Self-image is a compilation of the things seen in oneself whether they be internal, external or social attributes. In simple terms, self-image is what an individual sees in his- or herself. Self-image is not based on reality but rather on the individual's perception. This is why many anorexic women believe themselves to be overweight when they are, in reality, grossly underweight. Self-image is influenced by many aspects of an individual's personal and social life including, parents, friends, anxiety, stress etc. Rogers (1959).
A study done in China attempted to see the relationship between body image depression and self regard. The results showed that self regard is negatively impacted by an overall body image depression. Girls scored lowered than boys and students who lived in the city scored lowered compared to the ones who lived in the country side.
Ideal self.
The ideal self is the evaluation of what an individual would like to be. In simpler terms, it is the mental model of your “perfect” self. (Rogers, 1959). Often, the ideal self is not aligned with the individuals' capabilities in their current situations. This creates incongruity between the ideal self and the self-image. It is unusual to achieve complete congruence. (Rogers, 1959).
Self-esteem and self-worth.
Self-esteem is the assessment of one's own self-worth. In other words, it's the importance or value one attributes to oneself. When assessing one's own self-esteem, the evaluation can be positive, which indicates higher self-esteem, or negative, indicating low self-esteem. (Rogers, 1959)
High self-esteem has been associated with optimism, confidence and self-acceptance, whereas low-self esteem has been linked to pessimism, consistent worrying and a deficiency in confidence. (Rogers, 1959).
Erik Erikson's eight developmental stages.
Erik Erikson (1966)contended that the development was continuous throughout the lifespan. Erikson created the Eight Developmental Stages:
Bias.
Social bias is defined as "prejudicial attitudes towards particular groups, races, sexes, or religions, including the conscious or unconscious expression of these attitudes in writing, speaking, etc (social)." There are many different causes and many theories behind any one of the many effects of Social Bias. Some of the major effects are

Ballincollig RFC

Ballincollig RFC is a rugby union club based in the town of Ballincollig, in County Cork. The club was founded in 1978, and home games have been played at Tanner Park since the 1993 season.
The club has a Junior Munster Division 1 team, South Munster Junior 2 team and also a Junior 3 team, as well as Under 20, Under 18, Under 16, and Under 14 teams. Ballincollig RFC also supports a thriving mini rugby set-up. The club has a second senior team, with the founding of the ladies' team back in 1995, who won the AIL Division 2 title in 2006 [http://www.iwrfu.com/page/history4.html].
History.
Towards the end of the 1977/78 rugby season a group of 7 or 8 rugby enthusiasts had the idea of starting a rugby club in Ballincollig. They considered that in Ballincollig, a growing town with a population of approximately 10000 people, there would be a sufficient number of rugby players to form a good team. The formation of a club would also be an amenity for large numbers of children who would be growing up there. The enthusiasts were all from Ballincollig but played for different clubs. 
After a few meetings the club organised a match against Highfield in March 1978. The team consisted of mainly Highfield, Cork Con., and Dolphin players. The remainder of the team consisted of beginner rugby players and soccer players. All do an unusual team, Ballincollig won by 18-10.Games followed against Cork Con., Dolphin and Sundays well. The result of these matches were sufficiently good for the organisers to call a public meeting to launch the club and to register it with the Munster Branch of the Irish Rugby Football Union.
Crest.
The Idea occurred to the club that a crest should be worn. The idea for the crest came from the translation of Baile An Chollaigh as ‘Town of the Boar’. The crest was designed as a boar on a black and white background with three crowns of Munster on top but the three crowns became stars in a printing error. The crest can be seen on the club’s membership card, tie and jumper.
Pitch and Dressing Rooms.
At this stage the problem of a pitch and dressing rooms had to be tackled. The officers 
approached John A. Woods Social Club. The Social Club agreed to let them use their G.A.A. pitch and dressing rooms. A G.A.A. pitch is about 137 metres long, which is about 40 metres longer than what a rugby pitch should be, so the club had the longest rugby pitch in Cork and the lowest crossbar in Rugby history, but they managed and were grateful. During that season the club played very well, but did not win any trophies.
Playing Record.
Season 1978/79.
In the 1978/79 season the club entered competition at Minor B level. They played well in the league but failed to reach the semi-final. In the Minor B Cup they were beaten in the third round by Old Christians. During that season they played quite a few friendly matches against Junior teams. The results of these were quite promising.
Season 1979/80.
The players decided to move up two grades to Junior level because of the good results achieved in Junior friendlies the season before. A second team was formed that year also to facilitate the increasing numbers of players who were joining the club.
That year the club went on its first trip to Amsterdam. The Hague Rugby Club thought the team arriving was ‘Ballin College’, a long established college rugby team. They included five international players in their team. Suffice to say that the result of the game has never been made known outside the touring party!
Season 1980/81.
The club again played at Junior level that season; the 2nd team played at Minor A level. That season moves were made to form a Juvenile section in the club. The club made a second trip to Amsterdam and this time there was no mistake in the club’s identity.
Season 1981/82.
At an extraordinary general meeting that year the club decided to drop its first team back down to Minor A. This automatically pushed the second team back to Minor B level, which was much more suitable for them. At that general meeting also, the club was one of the few in Ireland to pass a motion against the proposed Irish tour of South Africa. That year the first team reached the semi-final of the Minor A Cup but were beaten by Cork Con, 16-13. Also in that season, Ballincollig seriously got involved in under age rugby. Trained by Jack Quaid, the Under 18 team won the West Cork Cup. They beat Bandon 12-3 in the final.
Season 1982/83.
This season was a disastrous one for Ballincollig RFC in many ways. At the beginning of the season, John A. Woods Social Club informed the club that they couldn’t use the pitch and dressing rooms anymore because they needed these facilities for their own members. The first few games of the season were played either in Highfield or at Murphy’s Farm in Bishopstown. Negotiations with Cork Co. Council allowed the club to lease the grounds at Innishmore where the present pitches are. Mr. Dan Murray agreed to rent dressing rooms and training facilities to the club at Ballincollig Community School.
In November 1982, the Vice-Captain of the first team, Denis Quaid, suffered a brain haemorrhage while playing against Kanturk on the pitch at Innishmore. He was rushed to hospital but all in vain for Denis never recovered. He died a few days later. He was 30 years old and his wife Mary was expecting their first baby. The baby boy, called Denis, was born the following April.
Season 1983/84.
At the start of the season Mary Quaid donated a commemorative cup in memory of Denis and asked for a competition to be held in memory of him. The club decided on a one day festival in September. Sixteen clubs were invited, fourteen clubs were represented. After a magnificent day of rugby, Muskerry emerged victorious. They were the first holders of the Denis Quaid Trophy.
In November the club held their most successful tour to date when they travelled to Plymouth with a strong team where they won one and lost one match. Also in that season the first team reached the semi-final of the minor A league, where they were beaten 6-3 by Kanturk. In the minor A Cup they reached the final but were beaten by Highfield 13-12.
Season 1984/85.
The highlight of this season was Ballincollig winning the Denis Quaid Trophy. That year twelve clubs were represented. The first team again reached the semi-final of the Minor A league. They were beaten by Dunmanway, 14-9. They were beaten in the first round of the Minor A Cup. The second fifteen reached the semi-final of the B Cup but lost to Kinsale 6-3.
In March 1985, the club ended its association with the West End Bar where all the weekly meetings and post match discussions had been held since the founding of the club. The West End changed hands at this time. The club was delighted to accept the offer of the Shanahan family to use Oriel House as their base. Oriel House also provided the club with dressing room facilities.
Season 1985/86.
The Denis Quaid Trophy was now firmly established as a prestigious competition. The competition this season was won by Dunmanway. Ballincollig won the White Horse Plate, which was a secondary competition during the Denis Quaid Festival. 
That season, the club held an under 12 competition as well. This was attended by ten teams. The teams were aiming to win a cup presented Tom Power. Presentation College were the winners.
Season 1986/87.
1986/87 had a poor start when the captain, Michael Moloney, following a road accident, had to stand down as captain. Phil Rees, the vice-captain decided to retire and Colin Glavin was eventually elected captain.
Mary Quaid became the first female officer of the club when she was elected Secretary. Mary Stratford became the first female member of the general committee. Douglas won the White Horse Plate. The competition for the Denis Quaid Trophy maintained its high standard and status. The 2nd XV reached the final of the McCarthy Cup, the real breakthrough.
Season 1987/88.
Beginning this season the nomenclature of rugby team grades in the South Munster Branch was changed. These changes were made to bring it into line with the other branches. The Ballincollig 1st XV or Minor A changed to Junior II and the Minor B team became Junior III.
The 1st XV (JuniorII) team played well in the league but did not qualify for the final stages. Neither 1st nor 2nd teams got very far. Midleton won the Denis Quaid cup.
