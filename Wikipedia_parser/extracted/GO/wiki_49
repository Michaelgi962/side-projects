Sribhargavaraghaviyam

Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam () (2002), literally "Of Paraśurāma and Rāma", is a Sanskrit epic poem (Mahākāvya) composed by Jagadguru Rambhadracharya (1950–). It consists of 2121 verses in 40 Sanskrit and Prakrit metres and is divided into 21 cantos ("Sarga"s) of 101 verses each. The epic is the narrative of the two Rāma Avatars – Paraśurāma and Rāma, which is found in the Rāmāyaṇa and other Hindu scriptures. "Bhārgava" refers to Paraśurāma, as he incarnated in the family of the sage Bhṛgu, while "Rāghava" refers to Rāma as he incarnated in the royal dynasty of king Raghu. For the work, the poet was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award for Sanskrit in 2005, and several other awards.
A copy of the epic with a Hindi commentary by the poet himself was published by the Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University, Chitrakuta, Uttar Pradesh. The book was released by the then prime minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee on October 30, 2002.
Composition.
Jagadguru Rambhadracharya composed the epic in 2002 at Chitrakuta during his sixth six-month Payovrata (milk-only diet). The poet chose 21 as the number of cantos due to several reasons. He composed the epic at the beginning of the 21st century, and it was the first Sanskrit epic to be composed in the 21st century. The number 21 is also associated with the narrative of the epic. Reṇukā, the mother of Paraśurāma, beats her chest 21 times after the Haihaya kings murder her husband Jamadagni. Subsequently Paraśurāma annihilates the Kṣatriyas 21 times from the earth. One more reason cited by the poet is that the previous Sanskrit epics which are included in the "Laghutrayī" and "Bṛhattrayī" – Meghadūtam, Kumārasambhavam, Kirātārjunīyam, Raghuvaṃśam, Śiśupālavadham and Naiṣadhīyacaritam – were composed in 2, 8, 18, 19, 20 and 22 cantos respectively; and the number 21 was missing from this sequence. The poet says that he composed the work as he intended to sing of both the Rāmas – Paraśurāma and Rāma, with the former being the Avatāra, the follower and the Brāhmaṇa and the latter being the Avatārin (source of the Avatār), the leader and the Kṣatriya. Although there is no formal division in the epic, the poet indicates that the epic consists of a first part of nine cantos describing the nine qualities of Paraśurāma, and a second part of 12 cantos in which the brave and noble ("Dhīrodātta") protagonist of the epic Rāma is presented with Sītā being the lead female character.
Most of the events described in fifteen cantos of the epic can be found in the Hindu scriptures including Vālmīki's Rāmāyaṇa, Tulasīdāsa's Rāmacaritamānasa, Śrīmadbhāgavata, Brahmavaivartapurāṇa, Prasannarāghava (a play by Jayadeva) and Satyopākhyāna. The narrative of six cantos is original composition by the poet.
Narrative.
The epic is composed in 21 cantos of 101 verses each. The first nine cantos describe the incarnation of Paraśurāma, his learning from the god Śiva on mount Kailāsa, the execution of his father's command to kill his mother and three brothers and their subsequent resurrection, his battle with the thousand-armed king Sahasrārjuna, the extermination of Kṣatriya ("warrior") race 21 times from the earth by him, and his confrontation with Śiva's son and the god of wisdom, Gaṇeśa. The next five cantos describe the incarnation of Rāma and his consort Sītā, and their child sports ("Līlā"). The final seven cantos follow the Bālakāṇḍa of the Rāmacaritamānasa, starting from Viśvāmitra's journey to Daśaratha's capital city Ayodhyā and ending with the marriage rites of the four sons of Daśaratha – Rāma being the eldest – in Mithilā.
The summaries of the 21 cantos are given below.
Poetic features.
Figures of speech.
A comprehensive listing of the figures of speech used in Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam is provided by Dinkar. Some examples of figures of speech used in the epic are given below.
Alliteration.
An example use of alliteration (14.28) from the praise of Sītā by Paraśurāma has eleven consecutive words beginning with the same letter – 
Devanagari
IAST
rāhi rājñi ratiṃ ramyāṃ rāme rājani rāghave ॥ 
Two examples of use of alliteration mixed with "Yamaka" (6.3 and 16.84) occur in the sixth and sixteenth cantos - 
Devanagari
IAST
cārī satāṃ cetasi nāticārī sa cāpacārī sa na cāpacārī ॥ 
Devanagari

dhīdhiyaṃ hrīhriyaṃ bhūbhuvaṃ bhūbhuvaṃ 
rāghavaḥ prāha sallakṣaṇaṃ lakṣmaṇam ॥ 
Metaphor.
In the following verse (6.97), the poet describes how Sahasrārjuna is killed by Paraśurāma, using the metaphor (Rūpaka) of a priest performing a fire sacrifice (Yajña). 
Devanagari

sahasrabhujamadhvare paśumivājuhodbhārgavaḥ ॥ 
Pun.
"Yamaka" is a kind of pun in Sanskrit and Prakrit where the same word occurs more than once and each occurrence of the word has a unique meaning. The following verse (3.26) from the third canto of the epic has the same four feet, but the same syllables stand for four different meanings, one meaning in each foot. Such use of quadruple Yamaka spanning the entire verse is also called "Mahāyamaka".
Devanagari
IAST
lalāmamādhuryasudhābhirāmakaṃ lalāmamādhuryasudhābhirāmakam ॥ 
Mudrā.
In the Mudrā figure of speech, the metre used to compose the verse is indicated by the use of its name in the verse. This figure of speech is used eight times in the epic, with seven different metres as shown below.
Prosody.
The poet uses as many as 40 Sanskrit and Prakrit metres, namely "Acaladhṛti" ("Gītyāryā"), "Anuṣṭup", "Āryā", "Indirā" ("Kanakamañjarī"), "Indravajrā", "Indravaṃśā", "Upajāti", "Upendravajrā", "Upodgatā" ("Mālabhāriṇī" or "Vasantamālikā", a type of "Aupacchandasika"), "Kavitta", "Kirīṭa" ("Meduradanta", a type of "Sapādikā"), "Kokilaka" ("Nārkuṭika"), "Gītaka", "Ghanākṣarī", "Toṭaka", "Duramilā" ("Dvimilā", a type of "Sapādikā"), "Dodhaka", "Drutavilambita", "Nagasvarūpaṇī" ("Pañcacāmara"), "Puṣpitāgrā" (a type of "Aupacchandasika"), "Prthivī", "Praharṣiṇī", "Bhjaṅgaprayāta", "Mattagajendra" (a type of "Sapādikā"), "Mandākrāntā", "Mālinī", "Rathoddhatā", "Vaṃśastha", "Vasantatilakā", "Śārdūlavikrīḍita", "Śālinī", "Śikhariṇī", "Śaṭpada", "Sundarī" ("Vaitālika" or "Vaitālīya"), "Surabhi" (a type of "Aupacchandasika"), "Sragdharā", "Sragviṇi", "Svāgatā", "Harigītaka", and "Hariṇī".
Short syllabbled verses.
There are seven verses in the seventh canto (7.11 to 7.17) of Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam composed in the Acaladhṛti (Gītyāryā) metre, which consists of only the short syllables in Sanskrit. The poet remarks that Paraśurāma extols the forest of Citrakūṭa in short syllables only, due to the feeling of humility. Two examples are –
Devanagari

gaditavimalavaraviruda kalikadana । 
śamadamaniyamamahita munijanadhana 
lasasi vibudhamaṇiriva hariparijana ॥ 
Prakrit metres in Sanskrit.
The 20th canto has 72 Sanskrit verses (20.1–20.72) composed in Prakrit metres, namely Kirīṭa (Meduradanta, a type of Sapādikā), Ghanākṣarī, Duramilā (Dvimilā, a type of Sapādikā), Mattagajendra (a type of Sapādikā), Śaṭpada and Harigītaka. The language of the verses in Sanskrit, but the metres and the prosody rules follow Prakrit prosody. An example is the following verse (20.13) in the Ghanākṣarī metre, which consists of 32 syllables in every foot. 
Devanagari

niśitaśaraśaraṇa dalitadaśamukharaṇa 
bhṛgubhavacātakanavīnajaladhara rāma 
vihara manasi saha sītayā janābharaṇa ॥ 
Rasas.
The principal Rasa (emotion or mood) of Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam is the "Vīra Rasa" (the emotion of heroism). Like the previously composed Mahākāvyas, Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam has all the eight Rasas as enunciated by Bharata Muni. These Rasas are – "Śringāra" (eros and beauty), "Vīra" (heroism or bravery), "Hāsya" (mirth), "Raudra" (fury), "Karuṇa" (compassion), "Bībhatsa" (disgust), "Bhayānaka" (horror), "Adbhuta" (amazement). Apart from this Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam also has the ninth "Rasa" as propounded by Mammaṭa – the "Śānta" Rasa (calmness), and the three new Rasas as – "Bhakti" (devotion), "Vatsala" (parental love) and "Preyas" (love). 
Like the 10th canto of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam and Bālakāṇḍa of the Rāmacaritamānasa, twelve verses in the seventeenth canto (17.42–17.53) of Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam have all the twelve Rasas used in the same context. Here the poet describes how twelve different groups of people in the assembly at Mithilā look at Rāma, each group feeling one of the above twelve emotions. The context is the same as in Rāmacaritamānasa.
Single consonant verses.
Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam has three verses composed using only a single consonant ("Ekākṣariśloka"s). The three Ekākṣariślokas are in the 20th canto of Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam (20.92–20.94).

Reception.
Critical Response.
Abhiraj Rajendra Mishra, former Vice-Chancellor of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University and winner of Sahitya Akademi Award in Sanskrit, writes in the introduction of the epic that in an age where the prevalence of Sanskrit is rare, several works in recent past have been published as epics which are devoid of the traditional features of a Sanskrit Mahākāvya, and have errors in grammar at many places. He thinks of Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam as an exception. He further says that this is an epic which nourishes the tradition of Ṛṣis, and with this composition the contemporary Sanskrit literature has been blessed.
Yogeshchandra Dubey, professor and head of department of Sanskrit at the Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University, writes in the Publisher's Note at the beginning of the book that he views Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam as having even more special qualities and features than the epic works of Māgha, Bhāravi, Śrīharṣa and Kālidāsa. At the end of the Publisher's Note, he presents a metaphor-
Dr. Vagish Dinkar, professor and head of department of Sanskrit at the R.S.S. PG College (Ghaziabad), and the author of the critique on the epic titled "Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam Mīmāṃsā", writes at the conclusion of his critique that Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam is worthy of being considered with the Bṛhattrayī as the Catuṣṭayī (the quartet).
Elsewhere, in award citations and in the media, the work has been described as "time-conquering" and "outstanding".

An Englishman's Home

"An Englishman's Home" is a threat-of-invasion play by Guy du Maurier, first produced in 1909. The title is a reference to the expression "an Englishman's home is his castle".
Play.
'An Englishman's Home' caused a sensation in London when it appeared anonymously, under the name "A Patriot", in 1909. It first played at Wyndham's Theatre on 27 January and went on to be a long-running success. It is now considered a significant example of the invasion literature popular at the time. The play was produced by Guy's brother Gerald du Maurier, possibly without his knowledge and with some assistance from J. M. Barrie. The story concerns an attack on England by an unnamed foreign power, generally assumed to represent Germany. The home of an ordinary middle-class family is besieged by soldiers, and the play climaxes with the father shooting an enemy officer and subsequently being executed. The play stressed Britain's unpreparedness for attack, and has been credited with boosting recruitment to the Territorial Army in the years immediately before World War I. It influenced niece Daphne du Maurier's novelette The Birds, which was made into a movie directed by Alfred Hitchock.
Film.
Du Maurier's play was the basis for the 1940 British drama film of the same name directed by Albert de Courville and starring Edmund Gwenn, Mary Maguire and Paul Henreid. A German spy is despatched to Britain to search out targets for a planned invasion.

Russians in Pakistan

Russians in Pakistan are a small expatriate community and consist entirely of students, employees, families and diplomats stationed inside the country. During the nine-year Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, Moscow had attempted to establish a commercial and industrial presence in Pakistan, by opening an Aeroflot office and setting up subsidiaries of steel and oil industries as well as a tractor factory. With only 56 Soviets in Pakistan in 1972, their numbers had suddenly jumped to 1,374 by 1980. In his book, the French political expert Roland Jacquard mentions that Pakistani authorities, who were already opposed to the Soviet presence in Afghanistan, became alarmed by the burgeoning increase of the population and entailed the Soviets to reduce their diplomatic presence in Islamabad by half. It has been alleged that during the time period, there was a strong presence of Soviet KGB agents in the country, who carried out spy work primarily from Peshawar and Islamabad in tandem with several hundred Afghan WAD agents, and monitored Pakistani aid to the Afghan mujahideen. According to Jacquard, one of the Soviet Union's objectives was to bring Pakistan under its sphere of influence and even when a sizeable number of Soviet diplomats were removed from operations in the country, there were approximately one-third who still worked for the KGB spy agency.

Harry Price (cricketer)

Reuben Henry "Harry" Price (27 April 1923 – 26 February 1991) was an Australian cricketer who played for Western Australia in the Sheffield Shield. 
Price was born in London in 1923, with his family emigrating to Australia a few years later, settling in Margaret River, Western Australia. One of his younger brothers, Wally Price, played football for , and represented Western Australia at football.
Price, who usually opening the bowling, was a left-arm fast-medium bowler and one of Western Australia's best from the 1950s. He was at his peak in the 1950/51 Sheffield Shield season, when he took 24 wickets at 18.41, which was twice as many as the state's next best Charlie Puckett and equal fifth most by any bowler that summer. 
In Western Australia's home match against Queensland that season, Price had a large role in a tense 19 runs win, despite coming into the side due to an injury. He took 5 for 68 in the first innings, with the fifth wicket coming from a hit wicket. Earlier in the innings, off his first three overs of the match, Price had three catches dropped off his bowling. Chasing 229 for victory, Queensland were well placed at 5-154, albeit with only 80 minutes remaining on the final day. After taking the new ball, Price dismissed all-rounder Colin McCool and wicket-keeper Ernest Toovey off successive deliveries. Queensland batsman Lawrence Chapman survived the hattrick but was trapped leg before wicket the very next ball to give Price a third wicket in the space of four balls. Price would secure the win soon after, dismissing Mick Raymer with just 16 minutes to spare, giving him a 10 wicket haul. It had been just his third first-class match for Western Australia and was the performance that secured a spot his spot in the team.
Some of his best performances came against touring international teams. In 1951/52 took seven wickets in a first-class match against the West Indies, with three in the first innings and four in the second. The following season he opened the bowling against South Africa and returned match figures of 6 for 94.
He was also a Western Australian state representative as an Australian rules footballer, which he played for Claremont in the West Australian National Football League. A defender, he featured in both of Western Australia's 1949 wins over South Australia, from the back pocket. 
His early cricket career had been interrupted by World War II, during which time he served as a corporal on the island of Morotai in the Dutch East Indies.

Clash of the Codes (rugby)

Clash of the Codes is the name given to the special two match inter-code series between rugby union side Bath RFC and rugby league side Wigan RLFC played in May 1996. A second code clash featuring St Helens and Sale took place in 27 January 2003, featuring one half of league one half of union. A third code clash is to take place between co-tennants Salford Red Devils and Sale Sharks on 26 August 2014 this will also be one code per half.
Background.
In 1895, most rugby clubs in the North of England broke away from the governing body of Rugby football, the Rugby Football Union, and formed a rival body, the Northern Rugby Football Union (later renamed the Rugby Football League) over the issue of payments to players. This "Great Schism" led to the creation of two forms of Rugby football - rugby union governed by the Rugby Football Union and rugby league overseen by the Rugby Football League.
100 years later in August 1995, the International Rugby Board announced that rugby union was to be an "open" game, ending the prohibition of payments to players. In January 1996, an announcement was made that Bath RFC, at that time the dominant club side in English rugby union, and Wigan RLFC, similarly the country's dominant rugby league side, would meet in a two game, cross-code challenge series that would see both clubs playing to each other's set of laws.
The cross-code challenge met with lukewarm support from both the Rugby Football Union and the Rugby Football League. The dates for the games were set for May 1996, which was the end of the domestic rugby union season, but was only a few weeks into the rugby league season (rugby league having made the switch to being a summer game that year). The date for the proposed game under union rules clashed with Wigan's Super League game against Sheffield Eagles, while the RFU stated that Twickenham would be unavailable to stage the game when they were approached by Bath due to their plans to reseed the pitch. Both clubs had agreed that, to maximise the potential attendances, the two games should be held at venues other than their own stadia (the Recreation Ground and Central Park). However, when word came out that Cardiff Arms Park had offered to stage the union game instead, the RFU decided to postpone the pitch reseeding and offer Twickenham as the venue. Maine Road, the home of Manchester City, and a regular venue for major rugby league games at the time, was chosen to host the game to be played under league rules.
The teams.
Bath.
Entering the new professional era, Bath were the dominant club in England. Since the beginning of the league structure in rugby union in 1987, the club had won six Courage League titles, while also winning a total of ten JPS/Pilkington Cups since that competition was started in 1972. The club also provided a sizeable number of players to the England team, including the then newly appointed England captain Phil de Glanville.
Wigan.
The beginning of the new Super League era in rugby league saw Wigan still at the top of rugby league. The team had just won the last winter RFL championship, their seventh consecutive title, while they had lost in the Challenge Cup for the first time in a decade, having won their ninth consecutive final in April 1995. As with Bath, Wigan provided a significant number of players to the national side.
The games.
Rugby League.
Build-up.
Five days prior to the rugby league game, Bath had won the Pilkington Cup in a hard-fought match up against Leicester that they had won 16-15, thus achieving a league and cup double, having won the Courage League title the week before. As a consequence, Bath had little opportunity to prepare for the game at Maine Road, with a single warm up game under league rules against South Wales RLFC. By contrast, Wigan had a relatively quiet build up; the Challenge Cup final, played the week before, was the first not to feature the club for a decade, allowing the players a week without a game. The day after Bath's Pilkington Cup final, Wigan played a Super League game at home to Paris Saint-Germain, which they won 76-8.
The game.
Bath got off to a bad start from the kick-off, when Jon Callard failed to make his kick go the required 10 metres. Within 90 seconds of the kick-off, Martin Offiah touched down for Wigan, but was penalised for a foot in touch. However, with only three minutes gone, Offiah scored the first of his six tries of the night. The difficulties that Bath had with coming to terms with the game led to further tries for Offiah (2), Henry Paul, Jason Robinson, Terry O'Connor, Andy Johnson, Craig Murdock and Scott Quinnell.
Bath were able to get into the game more after half-time and, following O'Connor's second try for Wigan, got on the scoresheet through Callard touching down and converting. This though led to a further period of sustained pressure from Wigan that led to a further six tries from the reigning champions and a final score of 82-6 in favour of Wigan.
Rugby Union.
Build-up.
Two and a half weeks separated the rugby league game from the return match under union rules at Twickenham. In that time, Wigan played two league games away to Halifax and Workington Town. Prior to these, the club became the first rugby league side to play at Twickenham when they sent a strong squad to take part in the Middlesex Sevens, a tournament that they went on to win, beating Wasps in the final.
With Bath having won the league and cup double, and the domestic season concluded prior to the first game, they were able to concentrate on the preparation for the second encounter.
The game.
Bath again kicked the game off, but this time, rather than conceding a penalty, Jon Callard's kick enabled Martin Haag to take and recycle the ball, allowing Bath's forwards an early opportunity to ruck and maul against opponents unused to this type of play. Only a Bath knock-on during the drive prevented a repeat of the first game and an early try for the experts. What this meant though was the Wigan pack engaging in a union scrum early on, and coming to terms with the differences of this compared with a typically uncontested scrum in their own game. Indeed, it was through scrummaging inexperience that Wigan conceded their first try, a penalty try given through their repeated collapsing of the scrum. Bath gained further tries through Adedayo Adebayo (2) and Jon Sleightholme prior to half-time, allowing the Courage League champions to build an unanswered 25 point lead at the break.
As in the first game, the second half followed a similar pattern to begin with, with Mike Catt and Phil de Glanville scoring early, with the likelihood coming of a score of similar dimensions. However, as the second half progressed, Bath's players began to tire and allowed gaps to open up for Wigan to exploit. Craig Murdock scored a pair of tries that went the length of the field, while Va'aiga Tuigamala got a third before Ian Sanders got Bath's seventh with a pushover from the pack. Unlike the first game, the second half of the second game saw the visitors match the home side for points to leave a final score of 44-19 in Bath's favour.
Aftermath.
Although played in some quarters as the start of a great coming together of the two codes, most people saw the "cross-code challenge" as primarily a commercial exercise. Wigan, having lost out on the income generated by a run in the Challenge Cup, were looking for ways to regain that, while Bath were in the process of making the transition into a fully professional outfit. That being said, the series did allow Bath to be exposed to a professional rugby team, with all of the consequences for fitness, strength and pace in rugby union.
Although Bath were evidently outmatched in the first game, they were able to take some positives; Phil de Glanville made the most tackles of any back on either side, while de Glanville, Steve Ojomoh, Jon Callard and Adedayo Adebayo all impressed watching league experts. Similarly, in the second game, as Bath tired, Wigan were able to exploit both their superior fitness and their superior running game (a facet of rugby league as opposed to rugby union) to gain a foothold during the second half.
Following the transition of rugby union to professionalism, and the ending of the ban on players that had played rugby league from playing the game, a number of notable rugby league players chose to take up short-term contracts with clubs in the Courage League during the Super League close-season. A number of Wigan's players from the cross-code series undertook such moves, including Jason Robinson and Henry Paul who turned out for Bath, as well as Martin Offiah, Va'aiga Tuigamala and Gary Connolly. Some later made permanent moves to the 15-a-side game, with Tuigamala's transfer to Newcastle Falcons for £1m being a world record, while Robinson became a mainstay of the England rugby union team, winning the World Cup in 2003. 
The cross-code challenge occurred while both Bath and Wigan were in the twilight of their time at the top of their respective games. Wigan's great rivals St Helens won the first Super League title in 1996 and, although Wigan won the first grand final in 1998, and got to three subsequent Grand Finals, they would not win another league title until 2010. Bath meanwhile won the 1998 Heineken Cup, becoming the first English team to do so, but have failed to win a domestic trophy since the 1996 Pilkington Cup, with their position at the summit of the English game taken by their fierce rivals Leicester.
The two match series was the beginning of a thaw in relations between rugby union and rugby league. The success of Wigan's two visits to Twickenham, for both the game against Bath and the Middlesex Sevens, led to the RFU offering to play host to the Challenge Cup Final in the event of Wembley, the event's traditional home, not being available. The RFL eventually took them up on this offer, with both the 2001 and 2006 finals taking place at the home of Rugby Union. Twickenham was also the venue for the opening game of the 2000 Rugby League World Cup between England and Australia, the first time the 13-a-side game had been played there, while games during that tournament were also played at Kingsholm and Stradey Park, both bastions of club rugby union. Bradford Bulls then followed Wigan's lead by participating in and winning the Middlesex Sevens in 2002. Similarly, rugby union has also on occasion decamped into the northern heartlands of rugby league; in 1998, England played two qualifying games for the 1999 Rugby World Cup at the Alfred McAlpine Stadium in Huddersfield, which also hosted a game during the final tournament. England have also played twice at Old Trafford, the traditional home of the Super League Grand Final. However, possibly the most notable event, certainly in England, came in 1998 when Leeds Rhinos RLFC and Leeds Tykes RUFC merged to form Leeds Rugby Limited, described as "the world's first dual code rugby partnership". Although there are separate teams in both codes, they are owned by a common organisation with a single board.
Further games.
St Helens v Sale.
Since the two match series in 1996, there has only been only a handful of similar endeavours to bring together union and league. In January 2003, St Helens took on Sale in a single game played at Knowsley Road, intended to have one half under league rules and the other under union rules. Unlike Bath, who were to all intents and purposes still the amateur side they had been, Sale had the benefit of almost a decade of professionalism to improve both strength and fitness that was necessary for them to adapt to the constant tackling required in rugby league, as well as being able to call on the services of a number of ex-league players. Having built up a 41-0 lead under union rules, this allowed the Sharks to restrict St Helens to only 39 points under league rules.
Salford Red Devils vs Sale Sharks.
In 2014, eleven years after the first dual code single game, it was announced that the AJ Bell Stadium would see another fixture, scheduled for 26 August 2014, between the facility's two tenants, Salford Red Devils and Sale Sharks, to raise money for various charities.

<doc id="31079386" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31079386" title="Vegetalismo">
Vegetalismo

Vegetalismo is a term used to refer to a practice of "mestizo" shamanism in the Amazonic provinces of Peru in which the shamans – known as "vegetalistas" – gain their knowledge and power to cure from the "vegetales", or plants of the region. Many receive their knowledge from ingesting the hallucinogenic, emetic brew ayahuasca.
Terminology.
The term "vegetalismo" is used to distinguish "vegetalistas" from other such healers as "oriacionistas" (prayer healers) and espiritistas (spiritist healers). The term is used by followers of Brazilian new religious movements to refer to both indigenous and mestizo ayahuasca shamanism in contrast to their practices. However, among mestizos in the Peruvian Amazon, the term "vegetalismo" is used to distinguish "mestizo" shamanism from the traditional shamanism practiced by indigenous peoples. Related religious movements include the more formal União do Vegetal and Santo Daime.
Structure of vegetalismo.
The "vegetalismo" practice combines deep Catholic elements with the animistic religious beliefs common to indigenous tribes throughout the region. Though many vegetalistas declare themselves to be Catholics, they receive their knowledge and power to heal from their special relationship with the spirits of the Amazon rainforest. "Vegetalistas" maintain relationships with two types of spirits: the spirits of the healing plants, often appearing in human form, and protective spirits, often appearing as powerful animals, birds, or humans. There are other spirit-beings (non-human entities) that exist in the visionary world that can assist the shaman; beings that come from other planets and galaxies, beings that come from infinite labyrinths of crystal rooms, and beings who live in the deep rainforest and beneath the dark waters. In contrast to indigenous shamanism in the upper Amazon, which is based within a rural environment and whose focus is to maintain or restore social balance, mestizo shamanism is based within an urban environment and is focused on individual healing. Many of these mestizo shamans have "consultarios" (clinics), where they provide consultations and healing ceremonies for patients, as well as other services such as massages and general, simple healing sessions, which usually involve the shaman sucking out the sickness from the patient's body, protecting the body with shacapa and tobacco smoke, and then prescribing an herbal remedy to help the patient in their recovery from the sickness.
Initiation.
Although "vegetalismo" is strongly influenced by indigenous Amazonian cosmology, and to become a "vegetalista" one must abide by prescriptions that conform closely to those found among Indian tribes of the upper Amazon, "vegetalistas" do not associate themselves with any specific tribe, therefore there is no community to support the initiation and recognize that the individual has become a "vegetalista". One becomes a "vegetalista" out of personal choice or vocation, and their shamanic powers become recognized gradually as they build up their reputation in the community in which they live.
In order to "dominar", or "master" the plants, one must first prove to the plants that he or she is worthy of their trust. They must show the spirits that they are strong and faithful individuals, and in order to do this they must spend generally a minimum of six months in isolation, living deep in the "monte"(the wilderness) in order to take on the odor of the jungle and take in the gifts of the spirits, while following "la dieta", the restricted diet. In order to become a very powerful shaman La dieta is key to forming a relationship with the plants, for the plants will not reveal themselves, their uses, and their icaros (sacred songs) to those not following the restricted diet. While a neophyte is undertaking "la dieta", he or she must abstain from sugar, salt, and sex, and often oil and fat as well. Generally, human beings smell bad to the spirits, so one must go on this long diet in order to purify oneself from this bad odor. One must practice abstinence while on la dieta in order to eliminate the smell of human sex, for to the spirits this smell is vile and repulsive. However, one must do more than the restricted diet in order to learn the plants, one must also ingest the plant, stay loyal to the plant while taking it into his or her body and allowing it to teach from within. Once the neophyte has undergone la dieta and has won the love of the plants, the spirits of the plants will appear to the neophyte either in visions or dreams. It is then that the plants begin to teach the neophyte their magical healing and protective songs, or "icaros".
Gifts of the Spirits.
An icaro is the magic chant or melody that the novice receives from the plant spirits after he or she has been purified by the restricted diet. The word "icaro" may come from the Quechua verb "ikaray", blow smoke for healing, or it may come from the Shipibo term "ikarra", shaman song. For indigenous tribes throughout the Amazon, songs are a key component in a healing ritual
Once a neophyte's initiation is near completion, either the spirits or a senior shaman will give him or her a magic phlegm, a magical saliva-like substance which is also called "yachay", "llausa", or "la flema". This substance is known to be the materialization of the shaman's "fuerza", or power, and it stored within the shaman's body, usually in the chest or stomach. This phlegm grows as a result of smoking "mapacho" and drinking ayahuasca. Both healers and sorcerers store "virotes" (magic darts) in "la flema", and within the sorcerer's phlegm one may also find creatures such as toads, scorpions, snakes and insects. A rarefied form of this phlegm, known as "mariri", is what makes it possible for the shaman to extract harmful magical darts or a sickness from the patient's body while protecting the shaman from the sorcery and sickness that he/she sucks out. The "mariri" is said to be air-like and its power often comes out in the act of "blowing", which can both cure and kill depending on its use.
The term "virote", originally the Spanish name for a very strong arrow, is a term used in "vegetalismo" to refer to the magical darts that the shamans and sorcerers store in their phlegm. Poet César Calvo describes a "virote" as a "very small poisoned dart, capable of abandoning and resuming its material shape in order to transverse any distance; any time; any wall, shield, or protection; to nail itself in enemy flesh and to reach the target selected by the sorcerer who gave it form and then animated that form, endowing it with destiny and transcendence." Depending on the culture and various circumstances, these pathogenic projectiles can be materialized as a number of different things, including the thorns of spiny palm trees, insects, tiny stones, stingray stings, snake fangs, scorpions, toads, monkey hair, among other menacing things. In the practice of shamanism among indigenous groups like the Shuar, these "virotes" are often referred to as "tsentsak".
Magic stones, "piedras encantadas", are an important tool in the practice of "vegetalismo". The appearance of the stone varies, some have a striking appearance which indicates that they are "encantada", for example the stone may be shaped like a person or animal, have an unusual color, or just be rare. Crystals are particularly prized as "piedras encantadas", as they are thought to be of a celestial origin. These magical stones are used to help those patients who appear to be victims of sorcery, the shaman will place the stone on the body where the sorcery has struck and the magic stone will stick there for several hours, sucking out the dart, phlegm, scorpion, or whatever harm has been inflicted there by the sorcerer. In order to master the use of these enchanted stones, the shaman must drink them while following "la dieta", just as he does the plants. Before the shaman drinks the water, the stone get left in water for a day and the shaman blows tobacco smoke over it while telling the stone what it is he wants to know. It is only after this that the spirit of the stone will appear to the shaman in a dream.
Ayahuasca.
The ayahuasca ceremony is a widespread practice among "vegetalistas", one that has gained a lot of attention in recent years due to the success of the industry of "ayahuasca tourism", in which people from all over the world travel to places such as Peru to partake in an ayahuasca session lead by a "vegetalismo" shaman. These sessions vary greatly depending on the vegetalista conducting the ceremony, and there are significant differences between an ayahuasca session held in an urban setting and one held in a rural setting. In urban settings a shaman will usually hold one of these sessions several times a week, and they usually draw crowds of about twenty people or more, many of whom don't know each other. In rural settings the groups are much smaller, usually less than ten people, and the people involved often know each other or have kindred ties. Generally in the urban setting the shaman will meet and speak briefly to everyone in attendance for the ceremony, gathering information on their illnesses and what it is their seeking to find from ingesting "ayahuasca". Some people attend these ceremonies regularly as a purge, to cleanse themselves.

Harold D. Schuster

Harold D. Schuster ( August 1, 1902 – July 19, 1986) was an American editor and film director. In 1937 he made "Wings of the Morning", the first-ever three-strip Technicolor film shot in Europe.
While the majority of Schuster's directorial output can be considered routine, there are two acknowledged gems among them. His 1954 "film noir" triller Loophole is a fast-paced, well-acted drama about a bank teller framed for a $50,000 embezzlement and his efforts to clear his name, and his 1957 Dragoon Wells Massacre is, despite its potboiler title, an actionful, tightly made western with some surprising plot twists in which many of the characters aren't quite what they seem to be.

Workers' University of Córdoba

The Workers’ University of Córdoba ("Universidad Laboral de Córdoba") was inaugurated on 5 November 1956 under the name of Onésimo Redondo in Córdoba, Spain. Located at "km 395" of the old motorway to Madrid, its estate covers an area of over 20 hectares.
The Workers’ University consists of six colleges named after personalities from the city of Córdoba: San Rafael, Luis de Góngora, Juan de Mena, Gran Capitán, San Álvaro and San Alberto Magno. There are workshops for professional training, theory classrooms, dining halls, a logistics centre with a bakery, laundry and maintenance services, as well as sports facilities including a running track, swimming pools, gyms and accommodation for teaching staff.
Among the premises of the Workers’ University, the main hall stands out, where offices, the Secretary and the church are located. 
In 1981 it was transformed into the Centre for Integral Studies (Centro de Estudios Integrados CEI), and later into two secondary level teaching institutions: the I.E.S. Gran Capitán and the I.E.S. Alhaken II.
Among the hundreds of lecturers and the thousands of students of the University during its thirty years of operating we remember: 
Sports.
The old Workers’ University, nowadays Rabanales Campus of Córdoba University, had among its sports facilities the first air-conditioned indoor competition swimming pool and the first rugby pitch in Córdoba.

Brezovica pri Črmošnjicah

Brezovica pri Črmošnjicah (; formerly "Brezje"; , "Wretzen", Gottscheerisch: "Brezə") is a small settlement in the Municipality of Semič in Slovenia. The area is part of the historical region of Lower Carniola. The municipality is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region.
Geography.
The settlement stands on a small hill above the road from Črnomelj to Dolenjske Toplice in the Črmošnjice Valley () at the tectonic division between the Gorjanci Hills and Kočevje Rog. There are fields west of the settlement, as well as former pastures undergoing afforestation and sparse birch and fern woods. There are gravel pits on Gaberkofel Hill (717 m). During dry periods, water was hauled to the village from springs north of the village. These springs also join to form Wild Creek (), which flows to Srednja Vas. Springs south of the village join to form Blatnik Creek (), also known as Little River (). The territory of the village now also includes the former village of Stari Tabor.
Name.
The name "Brezovica pri Črmošnjicah" means 'Brezovica near Črmočnjice'. The settlement was recorded as "Presaitz" in the land registry of 1574. The names "Brezovica", "Brezje", and names like them are relatively common in Slovenia and in other Slavic countries (e.g., Březovice in the Czech Republic, Brezovica in Serbia, etc.). The Slovene names "Brezovica" and "Brezje" are derived from the common noun "breza" 'birch'. Like similar toponyms in Slovenia (e.g., "Brezova, Brezovec, Brezovci"), it originally referred to the local vegetation. The German names "Wrezen" and "Wretzen", as well as the Gottscheerisch form "Brezə", are derived from the Slovene name. The settlement was renamed "Brezovica pri Črmošnjicah" in June 1955.
History.
Brezovica pri Črmošnjicah was inhabited by Gottschee Germans, who were mostly evicted in 1941 during the Second World War. It was originally founded by Slovene settlers and was one of the oldest Slovene settlements in the Gottschee region. However, by 1890, nearly the entire population was German-speaking, with only two speakers of Slovenian recorded in the census. According to the land registry of 1574, Brezovica pri Črmošnjicah had seven half-farms and four tenant farms. There were 15 houses in the settlement in 1710. The village reached its peak population in 1900, with 108 people living in 23 houses, and then went into decline after the First World War. Before the Second World War, the economy of the village was based on agriculture and raising livestock. The livestock was sold at fairs, and there was also limited commercial wine production and sales of timber. During the Second World War, the German-speaking population—80 people from 20 families—was evicted on 10 and 11 December 1941. The village was bombarded by German forces on 24 October 1943, nearly completely destroying it. The village has had a small population living in two houses since the Second World War.
Church.
The local church is now only a ruin, with only the belfry and the walls of the nave remaining. It was dedicated to Saint Florian and dated to around 1600. It was restored in 1890. The church was first mentioned in a visitation report from 1753. It had a rectangular nave, apparently barrel-vaulted and plastered-over wood timbering. A wooden choir loft stood above the entrance and also provided access to the bell tower. The chancel was pentagonal and had a window on each side. The church was damaged during the German bombardment in 1943, when the roof timbering burned. It was not restored after the war, despite efforts from the local Lukan family. The parish abandoned the building in 1963, removing the bells. The rest of the furnishings were removed by various collectors, including the main altar with a statue of Saint Florian in the central niche and additional statues on the sides and in the pediment, a side altar with a statue of Saint Vitus, and a statue of Our Lady of Lourdes created by August König from Srobotnik.
There were five chapel-shrines in the village before the Second World War: a masonry shrine on the southwest edge of the village along the road to Stari Tabor, a masonry shrine on the northern edge of the village at the fork in the road to Srednja Vas and Gaber, a shrine about 320 m south of the church along the road to Stari Tabor, a shrine about 360 m to the northwest along the road to Srednja Vas, and a shrine about 180 m south of the church.

Petar Omčikus (; Serbian Cyrillic: Петар Омчикус), Sušak, October 6, 1926) is a Serbian painter and member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, who lives and works in Paris, France.
Biography.
Since 1937, Omčikus has lived in Belgrade. After World War II, he began painting at the Academy of Fine Arts, in class of professor Ivan Tabaković. Together with his wife, painter Kossa Bokchan, left his studies in painting and went to Zadar, which became one of the founders of The Zadar Group, where they are also Mića Popović, Vera Božičković, Bata Mihailović, Ljubinka Jovanovic. After a six-month stay in Zadar, he returned to Belgrade where he joined The Group of Eleven, and his first solo exhibition, hosted in 1951. Shortly, after in 1952, Petar Omčikus and Kossa Bokshan left from Yugoslavia and definitely moves to Paris. Since 1965, they occasionally stay in Vela Luka on Korčula, where organized numerous international meetings of artists, philosophers and critics. He participated in numerous group exhibitions at home and abroad.
Art.
Beginnings of Omčikus creativity are related to several artists, all from the class of Ivana Tabaković, which is a few months together in Zadar 1947 making the first Yugoslav artistic commune – Zadar Group: Omčikus, his future wife Kossa Bokchan, Mića Popović, Vera Božičković, Bata Mihailović, Ljubinka Jovanović, Mileta Andrejević, Bora Grujić and their friend, student of literature Borislav Mihajlović Mihiz. Rise of the academic nature in the studio for the artists opened up new paths in which are free creativity will, in different ways, to remain during the whole of his creation. Omčikus in the 1951 joins The Group of Eleven who encourages him to continue searching for their own creative paths, then still in the domain of poetic figuration after socialist realism. But the real turning point in his art was happened in Paris. Meeting with the abstract art of the time definitely Omčikus directed towards free expression, a move that he is not looking for reality but for individual style. Geometrized associative abstraction of the period but from the beginning of the seventh decade evolved into colorful gestural figuration, which has retained elements of his earlier term. In the later stages of the Omčikus thematisation painting on the portraits, drawings of Belgrade, fantastic realism, and sculpture.

Trolleybuses in Milan

The Milan trolleybus system () is part of the public transport network of Milan, Italy. In operation since 1933, the system presently comprises four routes.
History.
A trolleybus system was established in Milan in 1933, with the opening of the short route 81 (Piazza Spotorno – Piazza Dergano).
In subsequent decades, the system developed rapidly, with the opening of radial and tangential routes. The new external circular route (originally CE ("circolare esterna"), now 90/91) was built as a trolleybus line.
In the mid-1970s, it was intended to transform the 90/91 circular route into a light rail line, and abandon the rest of the trolleybus network. Many trolleybus routes were therefore converted into bus routes, and their overhead wires were removed.
Routes abandoned during the 1970s and 1980s were:
In subsequent years, following the abandonment of the proposal for the 90/91 tram line, there were no more interventions on the system, except for some limited changes to the routes.
Currently, efforts are focused on reducing journey times, with the construction of dedicated lanes. There are no plans to expand the system.
Service.
The four routes are:
Fleet.
Milan's current trolleybus fleet is as follows:
Depots.
There are presently two large trolleybus depots in Milan. The first depot is located in Viale Molise, east of the city. This depot accommodates about 70 trolleybuses and 40 articulated trolleybuses. The second depot is in the west of the city, and more specifically in Via Novara. It hosts about 40 articulated trolleybuses.
Both depots are used not only for the storage of trolley buses, but also for diesel powered buses. In contrast with the depots used solely for diesel buses, these depots are fully covered, for the better safeguarding of the fleet.

Middlesex Rugby Football Union

Middlesex Rugby is the governing body for rugby union in Middlesex, England; Middlesex is a historic county of England that has since been divided up and shared between Greater London, Surrey and Hertfordshire though the appellation is still in use when referring to sport, businesses and postal address in the area. Middlesex RFU was originally created as the Middlesex County Rugby Club but within six years was being referred to as the Middlesex County Rugby Football Union and is now known simply as Middlesex Rugby.
History.
FR Adams Esq of Richmond F.C. called a meeting at the Bedford Hotel at which a resolution was passed bringing the club into being. He served as the Club and Union's first president until 1883 being succeeded by E. Temple Gurdon (also of Richmond F.C.).
Middlesex Sevens.
The world famous Middlesex Sevens were organised by Dr. Russell-Cargill and the Middlesex Hon. Secretary CS Bongard, the first tournament taking place according to one source in 1925 and others in 1926. This was the first seven-a-side rugby festival in England. The first tournament took place at Twickenham in aid of Middlesex hospital was won by Harlequins.

Past Presidents.

County side.
Middlesex County Rugby Union was originally created as a rugby club and as such fulfilled fixtures for six years before becoming the Union for clubs within the county. After becoming a union the club continued to operate selecting players from its constituent clubs to play representative matches for the county and to go on tours. 
Very early in its history, Middlesex played Surrey under floodlights at the Old Deer Park. This is possibly the first rugby match played under floodlights as electric light had only just been invented. A floodlit game was the ideal opportunity to try out the new technology although the game was not a great success by all accounts.
On 24 October 1905, Middlesex played the touring South African side at Richmond for their ninth match. The Springboks won 9 - 0, their narrowest score so far in the tour; a penalty by Douglas Morkel and try by Brink made the half time score 6 - 0 whilst in the second half the only points came from a try by Loubser. Middlesex fielded a cosmopolitan team including Jim Louwrens the South African College scrum half of 1901, three Welshmen who were also later to play for Wales (Harding, Jenkins & Williams) and the Scottish international Geddes. The match referee was Cartwright. 
On 2 September 1964 Staines RFC played a Middlesex XV on the occasion of the opening of their new ground, "The Reeves".
1968 tour of East Africa.
Middlesex were the English county champions for the sixth time in 1968, having defeated Warwickshire in the final (tries by Brian Stoneman and Sandy Hinshelwood helped them to their 9-6 win at Twickenham). At least ten of the players that had participated in the final went on the tour in July of that year. Middlesex played a total of seven matches on a tour that lasted a little over two weeks, two games being played in Uganda and five in Kenya. The tourists won all seven matches comfortably and reported that the standard of rugby in the region had dropped noticeably since some members of the touring party had last played there. It was generally felt that the East African sides lacked stamina and tactical nous; the latter is understandable as the opportunities for playing high level rugby in the region were limited, though the former is surprising as much of the region is at altitude and it would be expected that the visitors would suffer more than the hosts. 
The Middlesex tour party consisted of 70 members though the minority of these were players, the majority were officials and non-playing members who were travelling as supporters. Amongst the players, at least three had previously toured East Africa; Patrick Orr (twice, with Anti-Assassins in 1965 and Richmond F. C. in 1963), Chris Ralston (with Richmond F. C. in 1963) and Brian Stoneman (twice, with Richmond F. C. and Combined (Oxford and Cambridge) Universities, both in 1963).
Middlesex scored 262 points in seven matches, an average of more than 37 per game. In total they conceded only 14 points. They scored 61 tries, 32 conversions, three penalty-goals and two dropped-goals. Top scorer was Gordon MacDonald (45 points, all from goal-kicking), Ricky Parsons was second highest scorer (33 points, from 5 tries, the rest from goal-kicking), Mike Alder was third (31 points from 6 tries, the rest from goal-kicking). Top try scorers were Tim Rutter and Robin Jolliffe (7 each), Mike Alder and Roger Weaver (6 each). Francis Mann was the outstanding player of the tour. 
The tour had been organised by the Middlesex Hon. Secretary Barry Boyden, his assistant Cyril Brandon and the RFUEA's appointed Tour Chairman Bernard Nicholls. As with all rugby tours to East Africa in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, it would not have been possible without the hosting arrangements offered by the rugby fraternity in Kenya and Uganda; in order to cut down on costs, members of the tour party were welcomed into the homes of the hosts and provided for in a manner that was acclaimed by those that were lucky enough to have toured the region. Hence the frequency with which first time tourists rapidly made certain they returned a second or third time.

Automorphism group of a free group

In mathematical group theory, the automorphism group of a free group is a discrete group of automorphisms of a free group. The quotient by the inner automorphisms is the outer automorphism group of a free group, which is similar in some ways to the mapping class group of a surface.
Presentation.
The automorphism group of the free group with ordered basis [ "x"1, …, "x""n" ] is generated by the following 4 elementary Nielsen transformations:
These transformations are the analogues of the elementary row operations. Transformations of the first two kinds are analogous to row swaps, and cyclic row permutations. Transformations of the third kind correspond to scaling a row by an invertible scalar. Transformations of the fourth kind correspond to row additions.
Transformations of the first two types suffice to permute the generators in any order, so the third type may be applied to any of the generators, and the fourth type to any pair of generators.
Nielsen gave a rather complicated finite presentation using these generators, described in .

<doc id="31079497" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31079497" title="Adaptive comparative judgement">
Adaptive comparative judgement

Adaptive Comparative Judgement is a technique borrowed from psychophysics which is able to generate reliable results for educational assessment - as such it is an alternative to traditional exam script marking. In the approach judges are presented with pairs of student work and are then asked to choose which is better, one or the other. By means of an iterative and adaptive algorithm, a scaled distribution of student work can then be obtained without reference to criteria.
Introduction.
Traditional exam script marking began in Cambridge 1792 when, with undergraduate numbers rising, the importance of proper ranking of students was growing. So in 1792 the new Proctor of Examinations, William Farish, introduced marking, a process in which every examiner gives a numerical score to each response by every student, and the overall total mark puts the students in the final rank order. Francis Galton (1869) noted that, in an unidentified year about 1863, the Senior Wrangler scored 7,634 out of a maximum of 17,000, while the Second Wrangler scored 4,123. (The ‘Wooden Spoon’ scored only 237.)
Prior to 1792, a team of Cambridge examiners convened at 5pm on the last day of examining, reviewed the 19 papers each student had sat – and published their rank order at midnight. Marking solved the problems of numbers and prevented unfair personal bias, and its introduction was a step towards modern objective testing, the format it is best suited to. But the technology of testing that followed, with its major emphasis on reliability and the automatisation of marking, has been an uncomfortable partner for some areas of educational achievement: assessing writing or speaking, and other kinds of performance need something more qualitative and judgemental.
The technique of Adaptive Comparative Judgement is an alternative to marking. It returns to the pre-1792 idea of sorting papers according to their quality, but retains the guarantee of reliability and fairness. It is by far the most reliable way known to score essays or more complex performances. It is much simpler than marking, and has been preferred by almost all examiners who have tried it. The real appeal of Adaptive Comparative Judgement lies in how it can re-professionalise the activity of assessment and how it can re-integrate assessment with learning.
History.
Thurstone’ s Law of Comparative Judgement.
“There is no such thing as absolute judgement" Laming (2004)
The science of comparative judgement began with Louis Leon Thurstone of the University of Chicago. A pioneer of psychophysics, he proposed several ways to construct scales for measuring sensation and other psychological properties. One of these was the Law of comparative judgment (Thurstone, 1927a, 1927b), which defined a mathematical way of modeling the chance that one object will ‘beat’ another in a comparison, given values for the ‘quality’ of each. This is all that is needed to construct a complete measurement system.
A variation on his model (see Pairwise comparison and the BTL model), states that the difference between their quality values is equal to the log of the odds that object-A will beat object-B:
Before the availability of modern computers, the mathematics needed to calculate the ‘values’ of each object’s quality meant that the method could only be used with small sets of objects, and its application was limited. For Thurstone, the objects were generally sensations, such as intensity, or attitudes, such as the seriousness of crimes, or statements of opinions. Social researchers continued to use the method, as did market researchers for whom the objects might be different hotel room layouts, or variations on a proposed new biscuit.
In the 1970s and 1980s Comparative Judgement appeared, almost for the first time in educational assessment, as a theoretical basis or precursor for the new Latent Trait or Item Response Theories. (Andrich, 1978) These models are now standard, especially in item banking and adaptive testing systems.
Re-introduction in education.
The first published paper using Comparative Judgement in education was Pollitt & Murray (1994), essentially a research paper concerning the nature of the English proficiency scale assessed in the speaking part of Cambridge’s CPE exam. The objects were candidates, represented by 2-minute snippets of video recordings from their test sessions, and the judges were Linguistics post-graduate students with no assessment training. The judges compared pairs of video snippets, simply reporting which they thought the better student, and were then clinically interviewed to elicit the reasons for their decisions.
Pollitt then introduced Comparative Judgement to the UK awarding bodies, as a method for comparing the standards of A Levels from different boards. Comparative judgement replaced their existing method which required direct judgement of a script against the official standard of a different board. For the first two or three years of this Pollitt carried out all of the analyses for all the boards, using a program he had written for the purpose. It immediately became the only experimental method used to investigate exam comparability in the UK; the applications for this purpose from 1996 to 2006 are fully described in Bramley (2007) 
In 2004 Pollitt presented a paper at the conference of the International Association for Educational Assessment titled Let’s Stop Marking Exams, and another at the same conference in 2009 titled Abolishing Marksism. In each paper the aim was to convince the assessment community that there were significant advantages to using Comparative Judgement in place of marking for some types of assessment. In 2010 he presented a paper at the Association for Educational Assessment – Europe, How to Assess Writing Reliably and Validly, which presented evidence of the extraordinarily high reliability that has been achieved with Comparative Judgement in assessing primary school pupils’skill in first language English writing.
Adaptive Comparative Judgement.
Comparative Judgement becomes a viable alternative to marking when it is implemented as an adaptive web-based assessment system. In this, the 'scores' (the model parameter for each object) are re-estimated after each 'round' of judgements in which, on average, each object has been judged one more time. In the next round, each script is compared only to another whose current estimated score is similar, which increases the amount of statistical information contained in each judgement. As a result, the estimation procedure is more efficient than random pairing, or any other pre-determined pairing system like those used in classical comparative judgement applications. (Pollitt, 2012).
As with computer-adaptive testing, this adaptivity maximises the efficiency of the estimation procedure, increasing the separation of the scores and reducing the standard errors. The most obvious advantage is that this produces significantly enhanced reliability, compared to assessment by marking, with no loss of validity.
Current Comparative Judgement projects.
e-scape.
The first application of Comparative Judgement to the direct assessment of students was in a project called e-scape, led by Prof. Richard Kimbell of London University’s Goldsmiths College (Kimbell & Pollitt, 2008). The development work was carried out in collaboration with a number of awarding bodies in a Design & Technology course. Kimbell’s team developed a sophisticated and authentic project in which students were required to develop, as far as a prototype, an object such as a children’s pill dispenser in two three-hour supervised sessions.
The web-based judgement system was designed by Karim Derrick and Declan Lynch from TAG Developments, a part of Sherston Software, and based on the MAPS (software) assessment portfolio system. Goldsmiths, TAG Developments and Pollitt ran three trials, increasing the sample size from 20 to 249 students, and developing both the judging system and the assessment system. There are three pilots, involving Geography and Science as well as the original in Design & Technology.
Primary school writing.
In late 2009 TAG Developments and Pollitt trialled a new version of the system for assessing writing. A total of 1000 primary school scripts were evaluated by a team of 54 judges in a simulated national assessment context. The reliability of the resulting scores after each script had been judged 16 times was 0.96, considerably higher than in any other reported study of similar writing assessment. Further development of the system has shown that reliability of 0.93 can be reached after about 9 judgements of each script, when the system is no more expensive than single marking but still much more reliable.
Several projects are underway at present, in England, Scotland, Ireland, Israel, Singapore and Australia. They range from primary school to university in context, and include both formative and summative assessment, from writing to mathematics. The basic web system is now available on a commercial basis from TAG Assessment (http://www.tagassessment.com), and can be modified to suit specific needs.

Ama had his lands taken by the wealthy coffee planting family, the Regalados, during which he was hung by his thumbs and beaten. This was in the context of liberal reforms which stripped the indigenous population of access to their communal lands, which were appropriated by private landowners.
Ama was a day laborer in Izalco. He married Josefa Shupan, who came from an influential Pipil family in Izalco. 1917 he became a member of the catholic brotherhood "Cofradía del Corpus Christi".
His father-in-law Patricio Shupan was "mayordomo" of the brotherhood, who died in 1917 after participating at a dinner with president Carlos Meléndez. After Shupan's death Feliciano Ama became head of the brotherhood, which consisted exclusevily of Pipil.
In the early morning of January 22, 1932 Feliciano Ama lead the Pipil peasants of Izalco into the uprising against the landlords. With several hundred supporters he marched to the capital of the department Sonsonate. There the mayor was killed by insurgents from Juayúa, but landlords accused Ama, who fled into the hills of Izalco. There he was found by soldiers from the garrison of Izalco under commander Cabrera, captured and hanged in the center of Izalco.

Leper Stone

The Leper Stone or Newport Stone () is a large sarsen stone near the village of Newport, Essex. The name "Leper Stone" probably derives from the hospital of St. Mary and St. Leonard (fn. 1156?), a nearby hospital for lepers. Passers by could have left offerings of alms for the hospital residents in a small depression atop the stone; the hospital grounds were sold in the sixteenth century, and only a portion of the wall near the stone remains.
Julian Cope, Peter Herring, UK Geocaching along with D.G. Buckley and Ken Newton's paper for the Council of British Archaeology have suggested that the Leper Stone was set vertically in the ground as a megalithic menhir or standing stone. J.D. Hedges report of 1980 also classified it as a standing stone for English Heritage, who describe this type of monument as "A stone or boulder which has been deliberately set upright in the ground". Similarly it has been described as a monolith by the Proceedings of the Cambridge Antiquarian society.

Enhanced RADAR positioning

Enhanced RADAR positioning is a proposal for a position fixing system in maritime navigation, based on Radar navigation. It is the automation of the process of determining own position by means of RADAR fixing, using a multitude of objects with known position as reference.
The proposal was originally made by Jens K. Jensen from the Danish Maritime Safety Administration in 2009, in relation to the need for an independent source for position fixing, due to the vulnerabilities of GPS and other satellite navigation systems, identified during the work at IALA on IMO's e-Navigation strategy.
This proposal is currently being brought forward to the maritime industry through IALA, and an opportunity for practical testing of the concept in 2011 is being considered in the EfficienSea project partly financed by the Baltic Sea Region Programme and coordinated by the Danish Maritime Safety Administration.
Principle.
The navigation radar of a ship is currently considered a primary position verification device by navigators, as the radar can be used to identify conspicuous objects or coast lines, giving range/bearing to objects of a known charted position.
If a radar target - and thus the associated range / bearing of a conspicuous object - can be automatically correllated with the known position of that object in an automated manner, radar can be upgraded to an automated positioning system - or position verification system - and may ultimately function as a terrestrial back-up option for satellite positioning (GNSS).
Enhanced radar positioning is achieved through the continuous automated process of correlating a multitude of radar targets with a list of known objects in the vicinity of a vessel, with known position.
Components.
Through AIS, the "positions of surrounding vessels" are known, and could be used for automated correlation with radar targets – providing a position verification mechanism. This, however, requires a fairly precise á priori knowledge of own position and heading. The AIS positions of vessels are likely to be dependent on a GNSS system – typically GPS - and will thus be susceptible to the same vulnerabilities as the own vessels GNSS receiver.
AIS AtoN signals – or dedicated Application Specific Messages or information contained in additional chart object information in the S-100 ENC framework – could be used to identify the presence of "conspicuous, fixed or floating objects, that are suitable for radar reference". Dedicated messages could provide their position information, including the object shape, source and accuracy of position indication. The surveyed position of a fixed AtoN would constitute a very good radar reference with high accuracy, while the GNSS position of a floating AIS equipped AtoN would constitute a less reliable reference.
The introduction of Enhanced RACON (e-RACON) will enable radar based positioning that does "not" require an á priori knowledge of own position and heading, provided that the position of that e-RACON is known. This will enable enhanced radar positioning to be a reliable terrestrial positioning mechanism, truly independent of GNSS systems and their vulnerabilities, in areas equipped with e-RACON.

Aaron Y. Ross (aka "Dad" Ross, "Hold the Fort Aaron") was a gold miner, stage coach driver and guard, and train guard in the American 'old west'. He was legendary for having fought off a number of robbery attempts, some against overwhelming odds. 
Born in Old Town, Maine in 1829, Ross sailed to California in 1856 to mine for gold at Sutter's Creek, California, and later in Oregon and Idaho. In 1867 he became a stage coach driver and guard for Wells Fargo. That same year, between Fort Benton and Sun River, Montana his stage was accosted by 25 Native Americans, whom he repulsed in a running battle, killing five. He successfully fought off another robbery attempt by an outlaw gang at Silver Star, Montana and shot and killed the outlaw Andrew Jackson "Big Jack" Davis in Nevada in 1877 during another failed stage robbery. For one or more of these exploits Wells Fargo gave him a $650 gold watch. 
In 1883, at the age of 54, Ross was guarding an express train filled with $80,000 in gold bullion, traveling from San Francisco, when it was attacked by robbers in Montello, Nevada. Fortifying his car, Ross held them off with gunfire until they threatened to burn him out. He reportedly yelled that he'd see them "in a hotter place" than the one they'd make by burning the train. After a five-hour stand-off in which he wounded three, the gang retired and the train reached its destination in Ogden, Utah. The railroad company presented Ross with a $1,000 reward. He retired to Ogden and died there in 1922, at the age of 93. His obituary appeared in the New York Times.

Council of Preslav

The People's Council of Preslav () took place in 893. It was among the most important events in the history of the First Bulgarian Empire and was a cornerstone of the Christianization of Bulgaria under prince Boris I.
Background and sources.
In 889 Boris I abdicated and retired to a monastery and was succeed by his eldest son Vladimir-Rasate who tried to restore Paganism, the traditional religion of the country since 681. After Vladimir-Rasate was deposed by his father in 893, the latter gathered a People's Council in Preslav to legitimate the changes. Since the issues to be discussed were of great importance for the whole country, the attendance and approval of the higher and lower nobility, the clergy and representatives of all provinces was needed. There is no direct mention of the Council in medieval sources. The most detailed description of the events that led to the downfall of Vladimir-Rasate comes from the Benedictine abbot Regino of Prüm in his work "Chronicon":
Decisions.
According to the historians the Council was presided by Boris I and four major decisions were taken:
Significance.
The decisions taken during the Council of Preslav had a great impact on Bulgarian history. The official status of Old Bulgarian gave great impetus for the development of the Preslav and Ohrid Literary Schools. The Bulgarian culture and literature entered its Golden Age under the rule of the newly elected Simeon I and the country became the cultural and spiritual center of Slavic Europe. The removal of the Byzantine clergy and the Greek language from the liturgy ensured that Bulgaria would stay away from any strong or direct Byzantine influence in its policy and religious life. 
The Byzantine reaction was quick. As soon as 894 emperor Leo VI moved the market of the Bulgarian merchants from Constantinople to Salonica which was a heavy blow to the Bulgarian economic interests. This inflamed the first commercial war in Europe won by Simeon I after the decisive battle of Boulgarophygon.

Grace Mildmay

Grace Mildmay (née Sharington or Sherrington; ca. 1552–1620) was an English noblewoman, diarist and medical practitioner. Her autobiography is one of the earliest existing autobiographies of an English woman. Originally from Wiltshire, she married Sir Anthony Mildmay in 1567 and moved to Apethorpe Hall, his father's home in Northamptonshire. She practised medicine on her family and others, with an extensive knowledge of medical theory, and a large repertoire of cures. Her writings included memoirs, medical papers and devotional meditations.
Biography.
Lady Mildmay was born Grace Sharington or Sherrington ca. 1552 in Wiltshire. She was the second daughter of Sir Henry Sherrington and his wife Ann (née Paggett) of Lacock Abbey, and the niece of William Sherrington, the High Sheriff of Wiltshire, from whom her father inherited Lacock Abbey. She had an older sister Ursula, and a younger sister, Olive. Their brother William died in infancy. Their governess was a Mistress Hamblyn, a niece of Sir Henry who had been brought up by the Sharingtons. Mistress Hamblyn taught strong puritan values, as well as some medical knowledge including basic surgery. Grace also received lessons in music, needle-work, arithmetic and letter-writing. In her memoirs, she recalled witnessing visitors to Lacock Abbey who were of questionable moral character. On these occasions, Mistress Hamblyn encouraged her to write verse against the visitors' immorality. From her mother, she acquired the habit of daily spiritual meditation. In later life, she wrote a series of devotional meditations which consisted of 912 folios.
In 1567 Grace married Sir Anthony Mildmay who later took up the position of ambassador to France. He was the eldest son of Walter Mildmay, who had become the Chancellor of the Exchequer the previous year. Sir Walter was instrumental in ensuring the marriage of Grace to his son, who was initially less than enthusiastic about the match. For nearly twenty years, the Mildmays lived at Apethorpe Hall in Northamptonshire with Sir Walter. Sir Anthony was often away at court, and later in France; Lady Mildmay stayed at Apethorpe and filled her time with religious devotions, music and medical practice. She oversaw the daily religious observances at Apethorpe Hall and performed charitable duties in the neighbourhood. Her practice of medicine extended beyond the immediate family and her understanding of illnesses and cures was extensive. Her knowledge was based on Galenic theories, as well as being inspired by Christian teaching. She concocted large amounts of cures derived not only from plants, but also chemicals and minerals. Common remedies were made in batches of ten gallons at a time. One balm apparently contained 159 different seeds, roots, spices and gums, as well as 13 pounds of sugar and nuts, and over 8 gallons of oil, wine and vinegar.
Her daughter Mary inherited from her medical books, over two thousand loose medical papers and an extensive array of curatives.
The Mildmays experienced financial difficulties during their marriage, in part because of debt incurred by Sir Anthony's political and military activities. Sir Henry Sharington died in 1581 leaving his two surviving children, Grace and Olive, in dispute over their inheritance for many years (Ursula had died in 1576). According to Lady Mildmay's memoirs, Olive and other family members had convinced Sir Henry to change his will, reducing Grace's share. This last will had been a nuncupative one and Lady Mildmay ultimately won an equal share of the inheritance. Her husband later quarrelled with his brother Humphrey over their inheritance, and for a long time the couple lived with the worry that Sir Anthony would predecease his father. These financial worries disappeared after Sir Anthony successfully sued his brother for some of his land.
Sir Anthony died in 1617. Lady Mildmay died on 27 July 1620 and was buried at Apethorpe church, next to her husband. Their only child, Mary, married Francis Fane, 1st Earl of Westmorland, and had 14 children including Mildmay, Francis, Rachael and George Fane.
Lady Mildmay's autobiography—one of the earliest by an English woman still in existence—was written in italic script with revisions and corrections in secretary hand. Excerpts were first published in 1911 by Rachel Weigall.

Hermogenes Ilagan

Hermogenes Ilagan (born on 19 April 1873 in Bigaa, Bulacan – died on 27 February 1943) was a Filipino tenor, writer, stage actor, and playwright. He is a descendant of Francisco Baltazar. His talent in singing made him popular in the field of Theater Arts. Because of Ilagan's talent in acting and singing, he became known as the Father of Tagalog Zarzuela and the Father of Philippine Zarzuela.
Career.
Ilagan was a "tiple" (treble or soprano) and lead singer for a church in Bigaa, Bulacan. Because of Ilagan's talent, a parish priest in Bigaa, Bulacan brought Ilagan and his family to Manila. He became the singer for the Santa Cruz Church (also spelled Sta. Cruz Church). In return, Ilagan was able to study at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila (now known as Ateneo de Manila University). Although not able to finish schooling, Ilagan became a member of a zarzuela troupe (theater performers) from Spain. During the Spanish-American War, the Spanish performers went back to Spain, but Ilagan maintained his liking for the zarzuela, thus later on pioneered productions of stage drama in the form of Philippine zarzuelas. His forty years of involvement in the field of zarzuela created the period known as the Golden Age of Philippine Theater. In 1902, Ilagan established the Compania Lirico-Dramatica Tagala de Gatchalian y Ilagan, also known as Compania Ilagan, the first zarzuela troupe in the Philippines. Ilagan's zarzuelas have melodramatic, comic, romantic, and political qualities.
Works.
Among the zarzuelas that Ilagan wrote and produced were the following:

George L. Vose

George Leonard Vose (19 April 1831 Augusta, Maine – 1910) was a United States civil engineer and Professor of Civil Engineering at Bowdoin College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, known as educator in the field of railroads.
Biography.
Vose was educated at home and in Salem, Massachusetts. From 1849 to 1850 he studied at the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard College, 
After Harvard Vose started his career as assistant engineer on the Kennebec and Portland Railroad, and until 1859 was engaged on various railroads. From 1859 to 1863, he was associate editor of "The American Railway Times" in Boston, and then for three years he resided in Salem, Massachusetts. In 1866, he moved to Paris, Maine, and was occupied with railroad projects in Maine and New Hampshire. Vose was professor of civil engineering in Bowdoin College from 1872 until 1881, and held a similar chair in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1881 until 1886.
Vose's daughter Harriet Lenora Vose was married to Arlo Bates. Vose Spur, a subpeak of Mount Carrigain, is named for him.

Handbook of Railroad Construction.
The subtitle of the "Handbook of railroad construction: for the use of American engineers. Containing the necessary rules, tables, and formulæ for the location, construction, equipment, and management of railroads, as built in the United States." already explains the purpose and content of this work. It wants to offer rules, tables, and formulæ for the location, construction, equipment, and management of railroads. 
In the "Preface" Vose further explains that: 
Vose further explains that the work is written as "handbook" and not a "treatise", more meant as office companion than as a text-book for students. Fifteen years later he renewed this work, entitled "Manual for railroad engineers and engineering students : containing the rules and tables needed for the location, construction, and equipment of railroads as built in the United States". This work had the similar table of content but was prepared for both railroad engineers and engineering students.

London School of Economics Gaddafi links

The affair of the LSE Libya Links refers to the various connections that existed between the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and the Libyan government and its leader Muammar Gaddafi and his son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. The NGO Gaddafi Foundation pledged to donate £1.5 million over five years to a research centre, LSE Global Governance, of which £300k were paid. In addition, LSE Enterprise established a contract worth £2.2 million to train Libyan officials. In 2008, the LSE granted a PhD degree to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the son of the Libyan leader, for a dissertation. Currently, allegations circulate that Gaddafi's thesis was ghost-written and/or plagiarised. In December 2010, Muammar Gaddafi addressed members of the School in a video link-up where he was addressed as "Brother Leader" and received an LSE cap previously given to Nelson Mandela.
In connection with the civil uprising in Libya in February and March 2011, the links between LSE and the Gaddafi regime, and the conduct of individual members of LSE's staff, came increasingly to be questioned. As a result of the revelations, the LSE's Director, Sir Howard Davies, resigned on 3 March 2011, citing "errors of judgement". In a "New York Times" op-ed piece on 7 March 2011, Roger Cohen wrote, in reference to events that had transpired at the School, "It may be possible to sink to greater depths but right now I can't think how. ...The Arab Spring is also a Western Winter. ...How did we back, use and encourage the brutality of Arab dictators over so many years? To what degree did that cynical encouragement of despots foster the very jihadist rage Western societies sought to curb?"
LSE and the Monitor Group.
In 2004 Libya's government engaged Monitor Group, a Boston-based, Harvard-linked, consultancy firm founded by Harvard Business School professor Mark Fuller, as advisors on matters of public relations. According to leaked documents, Monitor Group received £2 million "in order to enhance international understanding and appreciation of Libya and the contribution it has made and may continue to make to its region and to the world." In addition, "the goal is to introduce Muammar Gaddafi as a thinker and intellectual, independent of his more widely known and very public persona as the Leader of the Revolution in Libya."
A number of Harvard University academics were active within Monitor.
One way to achieve this aim was to recruit prominent journalists and intellectuals who were prepared to travel to Libya and write in positive terms about the country. One prime target was academics associated with the LSE, such as professor Anthony Giddens (Giddens is a Fellow of King's College Cambridge and is an Emeritus professor at LSE ). In 2006 and 2007 the company organized two trips to Libya for Giddens, when the former LSE Director met with Muammar Gaddafi. Giddens has declined to comment on the financial compensation he received on these occasions.
Giddens' first visit to Libya resulted in articles in the "New Statesman", "El País" and "La Repubblica", where he argued that Libya had been transformed. In the "New Statesman" he wrote: "Gaddafi's 'conversion' may have been driven partly by the wish to escape sanctions, but I get the strong sense it is authentic and there is a lot of motive power behind it. Saif Gaddafi is a driving force behind the rehabilitation and potential modernisation of Libya. Gaddafi Sr, however, is authorising these processes." During the second visit, Monitor Group organized a panel of "three thinkers" — Giddens, Gaddafi, and Benjamin Barber, Emeritus professor of Rutgers University, author of the book "Jihad vs. McWorld" — chaired by the veteran journalist Sir David Frost. Returning from Libya, Giddens wrote about his "chat with the colonel," in the "Guardian", concluding that "If Gadafy is sincere about reform, as I think he is, Libya could end up as the Norway of North Africa."
LSE grants PhD degree to Saif Gaddafi.
In 2008, Muammar Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, received a PhD from the Department of Philosophy at the LSE with a dissertation entitled "The Role of Civil Society in the Democratization of Global Governance Institutions: From 'Soft Power' to Collective Decision-Making?" His supervisor was Nancy Cartwright, a distinguished philosopher of science, and Alex Voorhoeve, a political philosopher, advised on chapter 4 and the first half of chapter 5. In the text David Held is acknowledged as having "directly advised" the work. One of the two examiners, Lord Meghnad Desai, the founder of LSE Global Governance, had retired from LSE in 2003 and in 2007 was requested by the University of London to examine the thesis of Saif Gaddafi. The external examiner, Anthony McGrew, has collaborated with David Held on seven jointly written or co-edited books. There is some confusion regarding when the degree itself was awarded. The preface of the dissertation says it was submitted in September, 2007; an LSE press office statement says that the PhD was "awarded in 2008"; but David Held is on record as saying Saif Gaddafi "received his PhD from the LSE in 2009." What is clear, however, is that the examiners raised concerns at the time of the viva which required revisions to be made and the dissertation to be resubmitted.
In the acknowledgements, Gaddafi thanks "a number of individuals at Monitor Group with whom I worked to design and conduct the NGO Survey which provides empirical data for this thesis." This team consisted of Libyan and foreign academics, led by Professor Omran Bukhres, and included Bruce J. Allyn and Flora Rose, a Cambridge graduate who works for the leader of the House of Lords. When questioned, Monitor Group admitted to having contributed to the dissertation and acknowledged that such assistance had been a mistake. Our aim, they said, had been to "help the Gaddafi regime bring about change." The exact extent of the help provided by the team from Monitor Group is not established, and neither is it clear whether their contribution is in accordance with the rules of the University of London. In addition, it has been claimed that parts of the dissertation have been plagiarized.
"We read the thesis and examined Mr Gaddafi orally for two-and-a-half hours," Meghnad Desai commented, "at no stage did the supervisors or anyone else suggest to us that plagiarism was suspected and we found no reason to do so ourselves." "I can hardly be confident that nobody else helped him," said Nancy Cartwright, "since there's evidence that he lifted bits, but I'm confident that it isn't in the sense done by anybody else start to finish." "We take these accusations seriously, of course," said Voorhoeve, "like any accusations of plagiarism." The claims of plagiarism are to be investigated by the LSE.
According to John Christensen who independently tutored Gaddafi in economics, "Saif lacked the intellectual depth to study at that level, and showed no willingness to read let alone do course work."
Gaddafi donates money to LSE's North Africa Programme.
Even before Gaddafi had been examined for his PhD, according to a senior LSE source, the Pro-Directors of the School were "anticipating the solicitation of a donation." However no factual evidence has been produced to support this allegation. The money eventually arrived in June 2009 when the LSE Council accepted a £1.5 million donation from the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation, of which Saif al-Islam Gaddafi was the chairman. This is, said an LSE press release, "a generous donation from an NGO committed to the promotion of civil society and the development of democracy."
The donation was used to create a "North Africa Programme" which would "place Libya within the wider context of the region," and over time narrow its focus to "the specific issues and challenges facing Libya.". George Joffe, a Senior Fellow of the Centre of International Studies at Cambridge University was hired as academic advisor to the North Africa Programme. Professor Joffe was Alia Brahimi's thesis examiner. According to a leaked internal memo, Gaddafi had a direct influence over the research activities of the North Africa Programme. In July 2010, Brahimi met with Gaddafi in Libya and in Greece to "talk over objectives and expectations" and to "agree upon topics for workshops." The memo says that: ""The Programme will work with and consult the Gaddafi Foundation on all aspects of the Programme".
In addition, the programme commissioned scholars to write papers on various topics relating to North Africa, in return for fees from £5,000 to £10,000.
LSE planned to train "Libya's future elite".
"The Times" reported on 3 March 2011 that the LSE had secured a £2.2 million deal to train hundreds of members of Libya's elite. The School agreed to bring 400 "future leaders" from Libya for training in leadership and management, with an additional 250 people due to be trained in Libya itself. The private commercial arrangement was made by Gaddafi.
According to WikiLeaks, American diplomats were told in September 2009 by Libya’s National Economic Development Board that they were “co-operating with the U.K. government and the London School of Economics, among other U.K. institutions, on an exchange program to send 400 people to London for leadership and management training." Professor Francis Terry, Dept of Public Management, was academic director for the Libya programme and Julius Sen, LSE Enterprise, the co-director. Professor Terry described his involvement as "a very stimulating experience." According to press reports, references to the program on LSE's website have subsequently been removed.
Fred Halliday: "A Dissenting Note".
On 4 October 2009, Fred Halliday, Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the LSE and the School's leading expert on the Middle East, wrote a memorandum to the LSE Council regarding the proposed cooperation with the Gaddafi Foundation. "I have repeatedly expressed reservations about formal educational and funding links with that country."
While those in favour of accepting the donation argued that "Libya is changing internally," most informed observers agree that while some of the worst excesses for the moment have ceased, the rights of its people are badly protected. Libya "remains a country run by a secretive, erratic and corrupt elite." Since 9/11 the Libyan government has reached compromises with the West on a number of issues, notably the Lockerbie bombing and nuclear weapons. Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links. There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has "not" changed: the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland, and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state. Moreover, Libya's handling of the Lockerbie bombing "has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity,"
I have in the past, Halliday noted, defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states, "but there should be clear limits on this, depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct." Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya, but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same. Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya, including "its more prominent 'liberal' representatives." We must remember, Halliday concluded, that the "liberal" wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead "to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure." A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering. It is, as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution, "far too early for the School to take this step."
Human Rights Watch criticism.
In 2009, Human Rights Watch was allowed entry to Libya, via Saif al-Islam Gaddafi's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there. While HRW reported that there were concerns about the "repressive atmosphere," they felt there were signs of "improvement" and Sarah Leah Whitson, director of HRW's Middle East division said that one should not "underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far" by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya. She also wrote of her official visit that "the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization, the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development" chaired by Gaddafi. She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country's two semi-private newspapers, and said "it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far. Let's hope this spring will last."
In January 2011, HRW criticised other organisations as well as governments that had previously dealt with Gaddafi. HRW Business and Human Rights Director Arvind Ganesan condemned the London School of Economics (LSE) for allowing "abusive and corrupt officials or their families to launder their images in exchange for money". This was later followed by Ganesen saying that "the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam's father literally began to kill his own people". According to NGO Monitor, this was despite the fact that David Held, Co-Director of LSE Global Governance, was partially influenced by Whitson’s remarks regarding her Libyan visit, referring to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer.
In February 2011, HRW's Whitson admitted that "Seif Islam in fact abandoned his nascent reform agenda long before."
LSE, Libya and BP.
Peter Denis Sutherland, formerly Attorney General of Ireland, European Commissioner, and Head of the World Trade Organisation, finished a 13-year stint as chairman of BP, Europe’s largest oil company in early 2010. In Spring 2006 he was appointed Chair of London School of Economics Governors commencing in 2008.
At the LSE council meeting in 2009 Peter Sutherland declared a conflict of interest when the council decided to accept £1.5 million from a charity headed by Muammar Gaddafi. Sutherland’s conflict was that BP had signed an oil deal with Libya two years previously, at a time when Sutherland was chairman of the British oil giant. LSE records show Sutherland took no further role in that part of the June 2009 meeting.
Saif Gaddafi's Ralph Miliband Lecture.
On 25 May 2010, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi gave a "Ralph Miliband lecture" at the LSE, named after Ralph Miliband, a Marxist scholar and former LSE lecturer. Gaddafi spoke on the topic of "Libya: Past, Present, and Future." In introducing the speaker, professor David Held told the audience that "I have come to know him very well and I must say I have come to like him a great deal." He continued:
Saif is committed to resolving contentious international and domestic issues through dialogue, debate and peaceful negotiations. ... Within his own country Saif has spearheaded efforts to open with Islamic militants about the nature and form of their struggle in order to find ways of bringing them back into the political process. ... His success was based on the use of the language of "soft power," that is, the language of dialogue. ... Throughout this time I've come to know Saif as someone who looks to democracy, civil society and deep liberal values for the core of his inspiration.
Held went on to say that he had many tutorials with Saif and that throughout ongoing dialogue on a range of issues they came to agree on some, and to disagree on much.
On the evening of the lecture, a fight broke out between anti-Gaddafi protesters and pro-Gaddafi supporters. The police were eventually called in to break up the altercation. In a comment on 6 March 2011, David Miliband, Ralph Miliband's elder son and a former UK Foreign Secretary, was critical of the LSE's decision to invite Saif al-Islam Gaddafi:
The Ralph Miliband Programme at the LSE was founded by a former student of my dad's ... The idea of Saif Gaddafi giving a lecture under his name is just horrific to him and horrific to the whole family obviously, There were approximately 30-40 journalists at the event, however reports on the lecture were largely uncritical and did not raise the issues surrounding the LSE engagement with Libya. David Miliband continued his own association with LSE, giving a lecture at LSE on 8 March, two days after the above comments, where he made reference to the school's early history of economic liberalism combined with social justice.
An open letter by Professor John Keane asks Professor David Held to explain further his links with Libya and to reconsider his reactions. Professor Keane raises several questions, such as: Has the LSE Libya affair not done damage to the scholarly credibility of research programs in the area of democracy? Click here Keane's letter was heavily criticised by those who responded to it in the online magazine in which it was published (http://www.opendemocracy.net/john-keane/libya-intellectuals-and-democracy-open-letter-to-professor-david-held). Many argued that it was vindictive and overblown. An overview of Halliday and Held - who were both contributors to openDemocracy - with respect to the affair and the larger implications for the independence of UK universities was published by its former editor Fred Halliday, David Held, the LSE and the independence of universities.
In October 2011 Held resigned from his post at the LSE in advance of the publication an independent report into the LSE's links with Libya.
David Held issued a personal statement in reaction to the allegations, saying that "in many discussions and meetings I encouraged the development of [Gaddafi's] reform agenda and subsequently sought to support it through research on the North Africa Programme funded by the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation" at the LSE. In October 2011 Held resigned from his post at the LSE. The Woolf report examined links between the LSE and the Libyan regime. The inquiry report says it was Professor Held, who "first approached Saif about the possibility of funding his centre for Global Governance in December 2008". This was after the dictator's son had been awarded his PhD by the LSE but before the formal graduation ceremony. The gift offered was of £1.5m in tranches of £300,000 over a five-year period. Periodic payments were to be made annually. The report says: "This was not a one-off donation but the founding of a relationship between the school and the donor, which is not unusual. However, bearing in mind the volatility of the Gaddafi regime, the gift involved a substantial risk because of the length of the relationship." A decision was made that the gift would not come from Saif directly but from "private sector sources". This step "became essential to Professor Held's presentation of the gift. Unless the money could be shown as coming to the foundation from private sources it could have been seen as unacceptable money from the Libyan state."Woolf writes: "I come to no conclusions as to whether there was or would have been excessive influence by the donor over the use of the funds from Saif's foundation. However, what has been made plain is that proper structures of governance are needed to protect academic integrity against influence from the interests of private donors." The funding was accepted despite internal protest. Fred Halliday, a distinguished Middle East expert at the LSE before his death, criticised the donation in a letter that described the country's rulers as a "secretive, erratic and corrupt elite". Held was appointed to the board of the Gaddafi foundation on 28 June 2009, a few days after the gift was discussed and accepted by the university's governing body. Held subsequently resigned from the charity on the LSE council's advice.
Despite institutional and procedural criticism the Woolf report, however, exonerated LSE staff (including David Held) stating that they acted in what they believed to be the best interests of the school.
Questions remain, however, about the involvement of elite British academics at the LSE with the Gaddafi regime.
LSE's video link-up with Gaddafi.
On 2 December 2010, in a video-link conference hosted by the LSE, of LSE Global Governance, introduced Muammar Gaddafi as "Brother Leader," and referred to him as "the world's longest serving national leader."
I will be chairing this on behalf of Howard Davis, the LSE's Director who unfortunately couldn't make it this evening, but who sends the following message, “You are most welcome here Colonel Gaddafi. We wish you had been able to deliver some Libyan weather at the same time” -this is the message from Howard Davis -- “We are pleased to be asked to train Libya officials, and we hope the relationship will continue.”
Gaddafi used the occasion to denounce the Lockerbie bombing as a "fabrication and creation" of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, and revealed that the Libyan national, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, who was convicted of the bombing and imprisoned in Scotland in 2001, but returned to Libya in 2009 on health grounds, was preparing a multi-million pound ­compensation claim against ­Britain for false imprisonment and medical neglect. At the end of the lecture, Muammar Gaddafi was given a black baseball cap bearing the bright red LSE logo. "You're in good company," he was assured. "Mandela, Kofi Annan, and Bill Clinton also have them."
Saif Gaddafi's "Rivers of Blood" speech.
On 20 February 2011, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi delivered an address to the nation on Libyan state television stating that if no agreement could be found between protesters and the government "thousands of deaths, and rivers of blood will run through Libya". He also insisted that his father remained in charge with the army's backing and would "fight until the last man, the last woman, the last bullet."
On 28 February 2011, CBS News showed a clip of Gaddafi addressing a group of supporters in Tripoli. Holding a Heckler & Koch G36 assault rifle in the air, he told the crowd that "weapons are on the way." A day earlier, Gaddafi had told Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview for ABCNews that the Libyan government "didn't use force to stay in power," and asked her to show him "a single attack, a single bomb, a single casualty". On 5 March 2011, he told CNN's Nic Robertson in an interview that his family won't step down: "I am the government. If we would hold tomorrow election (sic!) my father would win with a big majority". Saif further told CNN that the world should not worry about the "200, 300 even 1000 militia...because now everybody is armed in Libya." In an interview with Benjamin Harvey from Bloomberg on 8 March, Gaddafi said that the crisis in Libya was "a passing cloud. This is an historic opportunity for Libya to become a first- class democratic state.”
The contrast between his appearance in Tripoli in 2011 and his appearance as a guest speaker at LSE, said the BBC, "could not have been more stark."
Director Howard Davies resigns.
LSE Director Howard Davies resigned on 3 March over the revelations. In a comment Davies said he had left the job because of "two errors of judgment": 1) his advice that a donation from Gaddafi's foundation was acceptable, and 2) his decision to act as a financial adviser to the Libyan government. Davies acknowledged in his resignation letter that it would “be right for me to step down, even though I know that this will cause difficulty for the institution I have come to love.” He added, “The short point is that I am responsible for the school’s reputation, and that has suffered.”
In a statement the LSE's Board of Governors accepted Howard's resignation with "great regret." Raheem Kassam, director of the 'Student Rights' group, called for the Libyan money to be donated to a charity to assist Gaddafi's victims.
Colin Talbot, who holds a PhD degree from the LSE and is currently the Chair of Public Policy and Management at Manchester Business School, told UTv News on 4 March 2011 that Howard Davies should not be blamed for carrying out what amounted to "British diplomatic strategy". Talbot, who also taught on the LSE's Libya program further said that Davies was not the only person responsible for tarnishing the university's reputation, because the British government had encouraged Davies to establish close ties to the Gaddafi family.
The LSE said in a statement on 21 February 2011, that its engagement with the Libyan authorities has already finished or has been stopped following recent events in the country. The School said no more of the £1.5m donation would be accepted. About half of the £300,000 already accepted had been spent and the LSE Council would next consider what to do with the remaining funds, taking into account the views of LSE students.
On 17 March 2011, Professor Judith Rees was appointed interim- director. Reese was pro director of the School from 1998 to 2004, and is currently director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at LSE.
LSE reactions.
Students.
Several protest actions were undertaken by LSE students in response to the revelations of the School's links to the Libyan regime, including sit-ins and demonstrations. The students have insisted that LSE repay the donation from Gaddafi's foundation and revoke Gaddafi's status as LSE alumnus. The donation had originally been welcomed by the then-General Secretary of LSE Students Union, Aled Fisher, in June 2009, as "exactly the kind of donation" the School should be encouraging." Fisher said he was "taken out of context" and LSE officials "withheld pertinent facts about Saif Gaddafi’s role in the state, which... would have made Council and I look differently on the issue," with Charlotte Gerada, General Secretary in 2011, stating it was "unacceptable" that LSE "used" Fisher "as a scapegoat."
In an on-line petition, present and former LSE students urged the School to revoke Gaddafi's status as alumnus and to cease all cooperation with the Libyan regime. "We were shocked to find out that the LSE has accepted a £1.5 million donation from the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation; an NGO headed by Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi... We are astonished that the donation was accepted in the first place."
Faculty.
Professor Meghnad Desai, defended LSE's actions, arguing that "Academic research needs money — Rockefeller was a robber baron once, but we take his money". "It was only after bullets started flying in Libya that Saif Gaddafi was found to have cheated. Nor had anyone until then objected that the LSE had received a donation from Saif Gaddafi's Foundation."
Professor David Held issued a statement saying that "in many discussions and meetings I encouraged the development of Gaddafi's reform agenda and subsequently sought to support it through research on the North Africa Programme funded by the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation."
Saif Gaddafi, said Alex Voorhoeve, "seemed genuinely moved by the desire to study democratic ideals and practice and my colleagues had therefore hoped he would have a liberalizing influence on the Libyan regime. ... I had hoped that at such a crucial moment, he would defend the democratic ideals that he wrote about in his thesis.
These reactions were echoed by Alia Brahimi, who claimed to be "tremendously surprised" by Saif Gaddafi's "Rivers of Blood Speech." Saif Gaddafi, she said, had been a reformer for many years but now "seemed to be backpeddling". "I’ve got nothing to apologise for. Saif told me he was keen that democratic reform should happen soon in Libya."
Henning Mayer, a former employee of David Held, defended the decision to accept Gaddafi's money saying it was made based on information available at the time.
In a statement Fred Halliday's wife said she recalled that her late husband had been opposed to accepting Gaddafi as a student.
The "Financial Times" reported on 3 March 2011, that the LSE had started to edit official university websites in an attempt to "remove references to Libyan links from its academics’ workplace biographies".
Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty had also faced criticism over the affair, due to her position on the governing council of LSE. The "Students Rights" organisation accused her of hypocrisy "for being "the director of a human rights group while legitimizing murderous regimes". She later admitted her embarrassment and shame about the Gaddafi affair and finally in April 2013 Chakrabarti's spokesman confirmed that she had severed all links with The LSE.
Gaddafi's replies to LSE reactions.
In response to the reactions of LSE members of staff, Gaddafi was quoted in the "Daily Mail" as saying "Just a few months ago we were being treated as honoured friends. Now that rebels are threatening our country, these cowards are turning on us. The way my former friends at the LSE have turned against me and my father is particularly upsetting."
Lord Woolf Inquiry.
On 3 March 2011, LSE announced that they had set up an independent external inquiry into the School's relationship with the Libyan regime, to be conducted by the former lord chief justice Harry Woolf. Lord Woolf is to conduct
An independent inquiry to establish the full facts of the School’s links with Libya, whether there have been errors made, and to establish clear guidelines for international donations to and links with the School. Lord Woolf is to make recommendations to the LSE Council as soon as possible. He is to have total discretion as to how he conducts the inquiry, and as to the matters on which he is to report.
The Woolf report was published on 30 November 2011. Woolf summarised his central conclusion as
The School established, in an incremental and piecemeal fashion, a relationship with
Libya. Before a global company embarks upon a relationship with a foreign partner, a
due diligence assessment should be conducted. No similar exercise took place in this
case. The links were allowed to grow, unchecked and to a degree unnoticed, until their
effect was overwhelming. In October 2009, the LSE’s Council resolved that the links
should be monitored carefully in future. That monitoring came too late. By October
2009 the relationship with Libya had been well established.
In addition, the history of the developing connection between the LSE and Libya has
exposed a disconcerting number of failures in communication and governance within
the School. The errors which I detail in the remaining chapters of this Report exceed
those that should have occurred in an institution of the LSE’s distinction. The pattern
is such that I am driven to the central conclusion that there were shortcomings in the
governance structure and management at the LSE.
Other universities with Libyan links.
On 19 May 2009, the French-language journal Jeune Afrique published an investigative report on the Gaddafi family's public relations campaign set up by Monitor. Titled 'Gaddafi: Mirror, Mirror, Tell Me Who is the Most Handsome' the article detailed how the Monitor group had been organizing visits to Libya by leading academics from US-and UK-based universities in order to meet Gaddafi the 'thinker and intellectual'. In addition to Michael Porter from the Harvard Business School, Francis Fukuyama, Professor of International Political Economy at Johns Hopkins University, lobbyist Richard Perle, as well as Robert Putnam from Harvard University traveled to Tripoli to meet Gaddafi. All the meetings had been organized by the Monitor group.
In the context of the scandal over LSE's Libya connections, it emerged that also Michigan State University had established a program to train future Libyan leaders. Moussa Koussa, Libya's foreign minister and the second most powerful man in Libya after the Gaddafi family received a Master's Degree in Sociology from Michigan State in 1978.
On 6 March 2011 the UK Daily Mail reported that the University of Huddersfield was in the process of training 100 Libyan police officers, on master's courses. The University did not deny the allegation and the news received very little attention compared to the anger directed at LSE. Later reports that more than a hundred British universities were involved with Libya also failed to excite much media attention.
In April 2011, the Guardian claimed that the University of St Andrews Centre for Syrian Studies received funding from businessman Ayman Asfari who was alleged to have links to the Syrian regime led by Bashar al-Assad. However, it later transpired that Mr Asfari had no links to the Syrian regime and the Guardian issued an apology to him in print in July; no such apology was issued to the University.

List of Grand National winners

__NOTOC__
This article lists the winners of the Grand National, a National Hunt horse race which is held annually at Aintree Racecourse in England. 
It is a handicap steeplechase over 30 fences and a distance of 4 miles 3½ furlongs.
Aintree publish a roll of honour in their racecards each year based on a list compiled largely from the fading memories of aging racing enthusiasts sometime around 1880-1890. By their own admission, Aintree officials concede that their honours record prior to 1860 is notoriously inaccurate, therefore the British Horseracing Board's records taken from the press accounts of the time have been used as a more reliable source for the connections of winners prior to 1860.
Unofficial winners.
Pre-1839.
The first official running of the "Grand National" is now considered to be the 1839 Grand Liverpool Steeplechase. There had been a similar race for several years prior to this, but its status as an official Grand National was revoked some time between 1862 and 1873.
1916–18.
For three years during World War I, the Grand National could not be run at Aintree, and so a substitute event was held at another racecourse, Gatwick. This venue is now defunct, and it is presently the site of London Gatwick Airport. The course was modified to make it similar to Aintree, and the races were contested over the same distance, with one fence fewer to be jumped. The 1916 running was titled the Racecourse Association Steeplechase and for the next two years it was known as the War National.

<doc id="31080019" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31080019" title="Peter Palese">
Peter Palese

Peter Palese is a United States microbiologist and Professor and Chair of the Department of Microbiology at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City, and an expert in the field of RNA viruses.
Palese built "the first genetic maps for influenza A, B and C viruses, identified the function of several viral genes, ...defined the mechanism of neuraminidase inhibitors (which are now FDA-approved antivirals)" and "pioneered the field of reverse genetics for negative-strand RNA viruses". Furtherance of this technique has been used by Palese and his colleagues in reconstructing and studying the pathogenicity of the extinct but deadly 1918 pandemic influenza virus. Reverse genetics also assist in the development of new flu vaccines.
Palese is the author of multiple book chapters and more than 300 scientific publications. He is on the editorial board for "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences". He has been awarded multiple patents on viral vaccines and antivirals.
Biography.
Palese received his Ph.D. in chemistry in 1969 and his M.S. In pharmacy in 1970 from the University of Vienna. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology from 1970 until 1971, when he joined the Department of Microbiology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine as Assistant Professor. In 1976 he was Visiting Associate Professor, Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine. In 1987 he was named Chairman of the Department of Microbiology of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
Working alongside Dr. Adolfo García-Sastre, Palese's research showed that most negative-strand RNA viruses counteract antiviral responses in infected hosts, owing to proteins possessing interferon antagonist activity. His work on "fundamental questions concerning the genetic make-up and biology of viruses" and virus-host interactions "uses molecular biological techniques to understand how viruses replicate and how they interact with cells to cause disease in their hosts", with emphasis on "the study of RNA viruses, including influenza, paramyxo and corona (SARS) viruses". Recent achievements include the development of a highly successful new animal model (the guinea pig) for studying the transmission of influenza viruses.
Honors and awards.
Palese is a member of the National Academy of Sciences (2000), the Institute of Medicine (IOM) (2012), the Austrian Academy of Sciences (2002) and the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina (2006). He has served the presidencies of the Harvey Society from 2003–2004 and the American Society of Virology from 2005-2006. Among his honors are the Robert Koch Prize (2006), the Charles C. Shepard Science Award (2006 and 2008), the European Virology Award (EVA) (2010) and the Sanofi - Institut Pasteur Award (2012).

<doc id="31080143" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31080143" title="S (set theory)">
S (set theory)

S is an axiomatic set theory set out by George Boolos in his article, Boolos (1989). S, a first-order theory, is two-sorted because its ontology includes “stages” as well as sets. Boolos designed S to embody his understanding of the “iterative conception of set“ and the associated iterative hierarchy. S has the important property that all axioms of Zermelo set theory "Z", except the axiom of Extensionality and the axiom of Choice, are theorems of S or a slight modification thereof.
Ontology.
Any grouping together of mathematical, abstract, or concrete objects, however formed, is a "collection", a synonym for what other set theories refer to as a class. The things that make up a collection are called elements or members. A common instance of a collection is the domain of discourse of a first order theory. 
All sets are collections, but there are collections that are not sets. A synonym for collections that are not sets is proper class. An essential task of axiomatic set theory is to distinguish sets from proper classes, if only because mathematics is grounded in sets, with proper classes relegated to a purely descriptive role.
The Von Neumann universe implements the “iterative conception of set” by stratifying the universe of sets into a series of “stages,” with the sets at a given stage being possible members of the sets formed at all higher stages. The notion of stage goes as follows. Each stage is assigned an ordinal number. The lowest stage, stage 0, consists of all entities having no members. We assume that the only entity at stage 0 is the empty set, although this stage would include any urelements we would choose to admit. Stage "n", "n">0, consists of all possible sets formed from elements to be found in any stage whose number is less than "n". Every set formed at stage "n" can also be formed at every stage greater than "n".
Hence the stages form a nested and well-ordered sequence, and would form a hierarchy if set membership were transitive. The iterative conception has gradually become more accepted, despite an imperfect understanding of its historical origins.
The iterative conception of set steers clear, in a well-motivated way, of the well-known paradoxes of Russell, Burali-Forti, and Cantor. These paradoxes all result from the unrestricted use of the principle of comprehension of naive set theory. Collections such as “the class of all sets” or “the class of all ordinals” include sets from all stages of the iterative hierarchy. Hence such collections cannot be formed at any given stage, and thus cannot be sets.
Primitive notions.
This section follows Boolos (1998: 91). The variables "x" and "y" range over sets, while "r", "s", and "t" range over stages. There are three primitive two-place predicates:
The axioms below include a defined two-place set-stage predicate, "Bxr", which abbreviates:
"Bxr" is read as “set "x" is formed before stage "r".”
Identity, denoted by infix ‘=’, does not play the role in S it plays in other set theories, and Boolos does not make fully explicit whether the background logic includes identity. S has no axiom of Extensionality and identity is absent from the other S axioms. Identity does appear in the axiom schema distinguishing S+ from S, and in the derivation in S of the Pairing, Null set, and Infinity axioms of "Z".
Axioms.
The symbolic axioms shown below are from Boolos (1998: 91), and govern how sets and stages behave and interact. The natural language versions of the axioms are intended to aid the intuition.
The axioms come in two groups of three. The first group consists of axioms pertaining solely to stages and the stage-stage relation ‘<’.
Tra: formula_2
“Earlier than” is transitive.
Net: formula_3
A consequence of "Net" is that every stage is earlier than some stage.
Inf: formula_4
Every set is formed at some stage in the hierarchy.
When: formula_5
A set is formed at some stage iff its members are formed at earlier stages.
Let "A"("y") be a formula of S where "y" is free but "x" is not. Then the following axiom schema holds:
Spec: formula_6
If there exists a stage "r" such that all sets satisfying "A"("y") are formed at a stage earlier than "r", then there exists a set "x" whose members are just those sets satisfying "A"("y"). The role of "Spec" in S is analogous to that of the axiom schema of specification of Z.
Discussion.
Boolos’s name for Zermelo set theory minus extensionality was "Z-". Boolos derived in S all axioms of "Z-" except the axiom of choice. The purpose of this exercise was to show how most of conventional set theory can be derived from the iterative conception of set, assumed embodied in S. Extensionality does not follow from the iterative conception, and so is not a theorem of S. However, S + Extensionality is free of contradiction if S is free of contradiction.
Boolos then altered "Spec" to obtain a variant of S he called S+, such that the axiom schema of replacement is derivable in S+ + Extensionality. Hence S+ + Extensionality has the power of ZF. Boolos also argued that the axiom of choice does not follow from the iterative conception, but did not address whether Choice could be added to S in some way. Hence S+ + Extensionality cannot prove those theorems of the industry-standard set theory ZFC whose proofs require Choice.
Inf guarantees the existence of stages ω, and of ω + "n" for finite "n", but not of stage ω + ω. Nevertheless, S yields enough of Cantor's paradise to ground almost all of contemporary mathematics.
Boolos compares S at some length to a variant of the system of Frege’s "Grundgesetze", in which Hume's principle, taken as an axiom, replaces Frege’s Basic Law V, an unrestricted comprehension axiom which made Frege's system inconsistent; see Russell's paradox.

Proto-Cathedral of St. James the Greater

The Proto-Cathedral of St. James the Greater (formerly St. James Catholic Church) is a church building and parish of the Roman Catholic Church located in Vancouver, Washington, United States. The parish is part of the Archdiocese of Seattle and traces its roots to the initial arrival of missionary priests in the Oregon Country in the 1830s; its first dedicated church building was built in 1846. The church was elevated to a cathedral when the Diocese of Nesqually (the original name of the Archdiocese of Seattle) was established in 1850; the present-day church building was completed in 1885. It was reverted to a parish church when the present-day St. James Cathedral opened in Seattle in 1907. The church building was listed on the Washington Heritage Register in 1986. The church was formally dedicated as a proto-cathedral, i.e., former cathedral, in 2013.
History.
In the 1830s, French Canadian Catholic employees of the Hudson's Bay Company petitioned the bishop in their native Quebec to send priests to what was then known as the Oregon Country. François Norbert Blanchet and Modeste Demers were sent to the area and arrived at Fort Vancouver in 1838. Blanchet and Demers held Masses in various buildings within the fort, and Catholics often had to share worship space with Protestants, an arrangement that did not please either group. In 1845 Blanchet gained the company's permission to build a new church just outside the fort, and the wooden building was dedicated as St. James Church on May 30, 1846. 
In July 1846, the Vatican established three Catholic dioceses in the Oregon Country: Oregon City, Vancouver Island, and Walla Walla. Augustin-Magloire Blanchet, François Blanchet's younger brother, was appointed bishop of Walla Walla. The Walla Walla diocese was abandoned shortly after, in the wake of the Whitman massacre; however, on May 31, 1850, the Vatican under Pope Pius IX established the Diocese of Nesqually, with Augustin Blanchet as its bishop. Blanchet chose to have his new diocese headquartered in Vancouver, and chose the existing St. James Church as his cathedral. The church was formally dedicated as St. James Cathedral on January 23, 1851. 
Blanchet retired in 1879 and his successor, Egidius Junger, set out to build a new cathedral in Vancouver. Construction began in 1884 and the -long cathedral was dedicated as St. James Cathedral the following year. The original church, meanwhile, burned down in 1889.
Junger's successor, Edward John O'Dea, realized that Vancouver was no longer the economic and population center it once was. In 1903, O'Dea transferred the episcopal see of the Diocese of Nisqually to Seattle and immediately set out to build a new cathedral there. The diocese was officially renamed the Diocese of Seattle in September 1907, and the present-day St. James Cathedral in Seattle was dedicated in December of that year. St. James Cathedral in Vancouver, meanwhile, was reverted to a parish church, as it had been before the diocese's establishment, and remains a parish church to the present day. 
In 2013, Archbishop J. Peter Sartain announced that St. James Church would be formally designated as a proto-cathedral (former cathedral) in order to recognize the church's historical significance to the Archdiocese of Seattle. It was formally dedicated by Archbishop Sartain on October 25, 2013, and the church was renamed the Proto-Cathedral of St. James the Greater.

Murad Pasha Mosque

The Murad Pasha Mosque (, transliteration: "Jami Murad Pasha") is an early Ottoman-era mosque and mausoleum in Damascus, Syria, located in the Suwayqa sector of the Al-Midan quarter. The mosque was erected and named after Murad Pasha, who served as the Ottoman governor (""wali"") of Damascus between 1568-1569. The mosque was built in 1568. The mosque is also known as the Naqshbandi Mosque () after the "Naqshbandi" sufi order which it served as a center for.
Architecture.
The mosque is built in the style of Ottoman mosques, rather than the prevalent styles in Arab lands. The building is noted for its similarities with other Ottoman-era mosques in Damascus, including Tekkiye Mosque and the later Darwish Pasha Mosque. The walls of the mosque were built using alternating lines of black and white stones. The mosque is built around a large courtyard (""sahn""), which features an elaborate fountain that was used for ablution (""wudu""). The courtyard is surrounded by an arcade of domed cells (""riwaq""), which were used as sleeping rooms by students and scholars at the mosque. The structure's walls are decorated with elaborate "qashani" tile panels. The interior rectangular prayer hall is roofed by a typical Ottoman-style lead-covered dome. The prominent hexagonal-shaped minaret is singled out as the only element built in "the image of the minarets of the Arab lands." The mosque also holds in one of its corners the mausoleum where Murad Pasha was buried. The mosque's main gate holds "kufic" inscriptions that mention the mosque's construction date and its patron's name.

Meath Archaeological and Historical Society

The Meath Archaeological and Historical Society is the main local historical society in County Meath. It is best known for its annual periodical of essays on Meath history called 'Ríocht na Midhe' (Irish language (Gaeilge):'The Kingdom of Meath'). Their field of work covers the area of the ancient Kingdom of Meath, which roughly corresponds to the current religious diocese of Meath.
History of the Society.
The society was established in 1937, but lapsed to a degree during the Second World War due to the rationing of materials such as paper and petrol which made the travelling, correspondence and publishing necessary for the society's activities difficult. However the society reformed afterwards and publication of its signature publication, 'Ríocht na Midhe', began in 1955.
Current activities.
As well as coordinating and publishing 'Ríocht na Midhe', the society also organises lectures on local historical topics in Meath, as well as excursions to sites of historical and archaeological interest in the area. Membership of the society currently costs €22 euro and entitles a person to attend all of the society's activities as well as receive a copy of 'Ríocht na Midhe'.

Societas eruditorum incognitorum in terris Austriacis

Societas eruditorum incognitorum in terris Austriacis () was the first learned society in the lands under control of Austrian Habsburgs. It was established, formally, in 1746 at the university and episcopal town of Olomouc in order to spread Enlightenment ideas. Its monthly journal, "Monatliche Auszüge" was the first scientific journal in the Habsburg Monarchy.
Background.
When the Habsburgs took over the Czech throne in 1526, as many as nine out of ten inhabitants of the crown lands were Protestants. Olomouc, as the episcopal seat became a centre for the counter-reformation, with the Jesuits taking over the local college in 1566. In 1573 the college was promoted to University status, and the special papal seminary, the Collegium Nordicum was established in 1578. Initially competing with the schools run by the Hussite "Bohemian Brethren", the Jesuits obtained an effective monopoly after the Thirty year's war: this brought savage re-Catholization and Germanization to the Czech population. The Jesuit monopoly was however challenged because the Moravian nobility wanted to expand the range of areas taught beyond just theology and philosophy. In 1679 secular legal studies were introduced at the University, and in 1725 the Academy of Nobility was established in Olomouc. Both these developments met with fierce opposition from the Jesuits.
It was the strong Jesuit reaction which led an alumnus of Faculty of Philosophy of Olomouc University, Joseph von Petrasch, to join with another locally based aristocrat, Francesco G. Giannini in obtaining the consent of empress Maria Theresa for the establishment the learned society in 1746. Von Petrasch was a noble of Slavonian origin who at one stage had studied Law at Leiden and who had also pursued a career as an adjutant to Prince Eugene of Savoy which had left him with the financial means to support the Societas eruditorum from his private wealth.
Objectives.
The society set itself the goals of advancing the sciences, in particular the natural sciences, mathematics, numismatics, and the history of scientific research, along with philology and literature. In the religious conflicts of the time between Protestants and Catholics, the Societas eruditorum took an objective and pragmatic approach, and it had members in both camps.
Members.
Petrasch was able to recruit many members from across Central Europe, eager to spread Enlightenment ideas with a journal of their own. The members included local members of the nobility, state officials (such as Theodor Anton Taulow von Rosenthal and Johann Chr. von Jordan), and Benedictine ecclesiastical historians (Benedictines such as Oliver Legipont, Magnoald Ziegelbauer and Hieronymus Pez). Its so-called "corresponding members" included the north German dramatist, critic, and German language reformer Johann Christoph Gottsched, the Slovak founder of Hungarian history-writing Matthias Bel, leading Italian scholars Ludovico Antonio Muratori and Angelo Maria Quirini and the Czech Bonaventura Piter as well as the Archbishop of Kraków Andrzej Stanisław Załuski and the Cardinal Domenico Silvio Passionei.
The members were designated as "anonymous" in order to avoid repressions from the state censors.
Journal.
The society was publishing the first scientific journal in Habsburg Monarchy, the Olmützer Monathlichen Auszüge Alt- und neuer Gelehrter Sachen (), with each issue having some 80 pages. The journal was on sale in Olomouc, Brno, Prague, Vienna, as well as by book sellers in Nuremberg, Wrocław, Leipzig or Bautzen.
Focus.
It was especially concerned with the reform and promotion of the German language as well as with spreading the Enlightenment ideas. The society was propagating various streams of contemporary thought. Two of them were of particular importance: the philosophical rationalism of Christian Wolff, a practical approach to philosophy which in Moravia was combined with the Catholic reformism of Ludovico Antonio Muratori; and the school of critical historiography stemming from Jean Mabillon.
The German focus of the Society was not so much aimed against Czech language, rather against the prevailing use of Latin as lingua franca as well as against the Gaul-mania of the high German society.
The Society received state protection, but opposition from within the Jesuit-dominated town, ongoing problems with Vienna-based censors, as well as disagreements from within the Society itself, led to its premature demise. Nevertheless, its periodical represented a landmark: the first attempt within the Habsburg monarchy to unite the learned, the dilettanti and the "curieux" and to bring them into contact with the pan-European "Respublica literaria".

Crescendo (novel)

Crescendo is a young adult paranormal romance novel by Becca Fitzpatrick and the second book in the "Hush, Hush" series. The book was first published on October 19, 2010 through Simon & Schuster and spent ten weeks on the New York Times Best Sellers list. The book was also voted as one of the Young Adult Library Services Association's Teens’ Top Ten for 2011.
Fitzpatrick told Metro France that she had to re-write the book from scratch after her editor hated the first version.
Plot summary.
In "Crescendo" Nora and Patch's relationship is threatened by his refusal to tell her that he loves her and by his new fascination with Marcie. Hurt, Nora begins hanging out with her old friend Scott, whom she believes is a Nephilim. She discovers from Patch that Scott is indeed a Nephilim, but ultimately fires him as her guardian angel after she discovers him with Marcie. Nora is later given a letter that tells her that the "Black Hand" killed her father and is further distraught when Patch appears to be going out with Marcie. Nora undergoes several attempts on her life as well as several intense interactions with Patch. She tries to make him jealous by making out with Scott, which results in the two boys fighting.
Patch later offers to go rogue for Nora in order to be with her, but is refused because she doesn't want to be the cause of his downfall. Her feelings for Patch are even more conflicted when Rixon, a boy that her best friend Vee is dating, tells her that Patch is the Black Hand. Her emotions are put into further turmoil when Marcie tells her that Nora's mother has been having an affair with Marcie's father Hank for eleven years, the cause of Marcie's hatred for Nora. Already upset, Nora tries to break up with Patch when he tells her in a dream that he's Marcie's guardian angel, but he refuses.
The book then culminates in a showdown between her father's true killer, who is revealed to be Rixon. He tells her that not only was he behind all of the events in the book, but that he wants to use her as a sacrifice. He shoots Scott and Nora, who live, but is ultimately stopped by Patch and later sent to Hell. The book then concludes with Scott leaving in order to avoid further issues with the police, Nora and Patch reuniting, and Nora's biological father Hank asking Nora if she killed Chauncey.
Reception.
Critical reception to "Crescendo" has been mixed, with Kirkus Reviews stating "Just as the drawn-out plot answers Nora’s lingering questions, it introduces a new dilemma and opener for another sequel". The Manila Bulletin panned the novel, saying that "plot is an afterthought, while the News de Stars praised the entry as "easy and catchy".

The Blue Moon (musical)

The Blue Moon is an Edwardian musical comedy with music composed by Howard Talbot and Paul Rubens, lyrics by Percy Greenbank and Rubens and a book by Harold Ellis and by Alexander M. Thompson. It is set in India during the days of the British Raj, and concerns the love of a singing girl for a young British army officer.
It ran in London in 1905, starring Courtice Pounds, and was then played in the English provinces and in America and Australia.
History.
"The Blue Moon" was originally staged in Northampton on 29 February 1904, with a book by Harold Ellis. By the time of the London production, Ellis had died, and the book was revised by Alexander M. Thompson (credited as "A. M. Thompson"). The lyrics were by Percy Greenbank and Paul Rubens, and the music by Rubens and Howard Talbot. 
The London production, produced by Robert Courtneidge, opened at the Lyric Theatre on 28 August 1905. Despite generally favourable press notices, it ran for only 182 performances, not a significant success by the standards of the Edwardian London stage. Nevertheless, in 1906, a production toured the English provinces, and another opened on Broadway, starring Ethel Jackson. The J. C. Williamson company toured a production in Australia in 1907–08.
Synopsis.
"Blue Moon" is the title by which the young singer Chandral Nil is popularly known. She is generally assumed to be Burmese, but is in fact English, abducted from her mother Lady Augusta Brabasham, by a criminal deserter from the British army. He fled to avoid arrest for theft and took the young child with him. He is now calling himself Moolraj and plies a trade as an "idol maker, juggler and marriage broker." Captain Jack Ormsby, a young officer whose regiment is stationed nearby, has fallen in love with Chandra Nil. Moolraj has other plans for her, having promised her as a wife to Prince Badahur of Kharikar. The Prince, learning of Jack's love, gracefully withdraws and hands over his bride-to-be to the young captain. Subsidiary love interests are those of Private Charlie Taylor, who loves a lady's maid, Millicent Leroy, and the journalist Bobbie Scott and his admirer Evelyn Ormsby. Moolraj comes face to face with the Major, who was the victim of the robbery that caused Moolraj to flee England. This unexpected meeting forces Moolraj to explain who Chandra Nil really is, and Jack is able to marry his singing girl without shocking his aristocratic relations.
Musical numbers.
Numbers marked* were composed by Talbot; the others by Rubens.
Critical reception.
"The Times" made fun of the lack of plot, and said that if there were any less of a story, the show would have to be billed as a series of turns rather than a musical play. "The only things that matter now are the turns. Are they "bright" and "pretty"? Are Mr. Edouin and Mr. Passmore funny? Are the dresses splendid, the music soothing or exciting, and the ladies beautiful? We can answer all those questions in the affirmative." "The Observer" commented, "The specially hearty welcome accorded to the piece at its "première" certainly suggests that if, as some have been alleging, this particular form of entertainment is dying out, it is at any rate dying very hard, and is capable of rousing much laughter and applause by its moribund mirth." "The Daily Mail" also predicted success for the musical, describing it as:
the pleasant, light, more or less connected variety show so dear to the heart of the tired Londoner in search of a jolly digestive. What matter if the story is conventional or the music tinkly? There are plenty of neat lyrics, comic situations, and pretty love-scenes. The dresses are lovely and charming, and the scenery charming and lovely. ... [Pounds's] charm of personality was as irresistible as ever, and he sang his best number, "The Burmah Girl," as only Courtice Pounds could sing it – even with a cold. The discovery of the evening was Miss Florence Smithson. Never has a daintier, quainter, more plaintive little singer graced the boards of the lyric stage. ... Passmore danced very nimbly, and made a hit with an eccentric number, entitled "The Crocodile." ... Moore made a sly, useful maid.
Reviewing the touring production, "The Manchester Guardian" praised the score: "The music has not the fascinating charm of André Messager's music; it excels in a more northern quality of sentimentalism which, in moderation, does not harm anybody." "The New York Times" gave the Broadway production an unfavourable notice; of the comic lead, James T. Powers, it wrote, "one gets rather tired seeing him labor to put humor into lines which are absolutely without a vestige of that desirable quality."

The Boys from St. Petri (novel)

The Boys from St. Petri is a children's book written by Danish author Bjarne Reuter, published in English by Puffin Books in 1994. The novel was the 1995 recipient of the Mildred L. Batchelder Award, an award granted by the American Library Association for outstanding children's books originally published in a foreign language. The novel has been cited by multiple scholars in the field of education for its lessons on activism and the Danish resistance during World War II.
Plot.
Summer 1942.
Lars is trying to get into a club called the St. Petri group, which is against the Nazis and Adolf Hitler taking over Denmark, his home. He has to go through an initiation test and support the weight of the church’s chandelier without dropping it, in order to join. And meanwhile, Lars finds a German Luger (gun) which was stolen by a boy named Otto Hvidemann, who later joins the St.Petri group. After Lars succeeds entry into the group the boys plan their first true sabotage of the German headquarters.
Fall 1942.
The fall is when the boys plan to steal some bombs from the German headquarters so they can later blow up the railroad tracks that will carry the German machinery for the war. But when they get there things go wrong. A phone started to ring and when they tried to stop it they tripped over one another and set off an alarm. The Germans then start to come investigate what all the noise is about so the boys have to run. Everything then happened very quickly; everyone started to run, then they sent the dogs to go and search for the intruders. In the midst of all the confusion Otto stole a rifle and sub-machine gun and helped Gunner and Luffy stuff Gunners backpack with bombs that were hidden in the German headquarters and brought it back for the club to use later on. When the German's attack dog was let loose it came running at Lars. He got scared and shot the dog in the head with the luger. When the gun fired it caused the Germans to think they were getting shot at opposed to the dog. They started to fire at them. So the boys had no other choice but to shoot back at them and when they did more Germans came running and by the end of night many Germans were shot. When they were about to leave, a young German boy who was unarmed was on the ground saying "don't kill me". The boys were going to but Lars told them that they could not or it would make them like the Germans. As they were leaving, Otto got shot in the arm.
They took Otto to Dr. Halling for help but the man said no because he suspected what the boys had been up to and that they were the saboteurs all the other times. Gunnar then put the gun to his head and told him “I personally, have shot ten Germans tonight. So one more isn’t going to make much difference.” The doctor finally complied to the boys' requests and patched up Otto's arm, and as they were leaving Gunner said if you tell anyone, you are dead. All the boys got on their bike and rode to the brewery where they sat against the wall talking and listening to the sounds of the sirens from the German airfield that they had triggered hours before. Luffy’s words were already beginning to slur so even though they had only been there for a short time, they decided to congratulate one another and head home.
The next day at school, all the boys who were there got called to line up at the front where German soldiers were standing and waiting. The young boy soldier who they had let live the previous day was also with the men and this made Lars and Gunner very nervous. The men started to walk the younger boy down the row of boys as he searched their faces on by one. Then the boy caught Lars' eye and gave him a knowing look as if they were on the same side. Lars fidgeted nervously as the men neared and soon he was standing in front of Lars but he passed him without a second glance. The young boy did the same to Gunner, Luff, and Soren, passing them, pretending that he had never seen the boys.
Winter 1942.
Lars and Gunnar went to the church to fit new candles into the pews, when they saw Sevend (Suckerfish). Gunnar stood in front of Sevend and Sevend was drilling him with questions like “Are you a man of your country” and “Do you feel Danish”. The Nazi German does not intimidate Gunnar or his little Brother when he starts threatening them with bad intentions, and discretely telling them he knew what the boys were up to.
The St. Petri Group were all afraid of the outcome of what they are about to do. All the boys planned to sneak away from the school play and run to the railroad tracks where a large train would arrive with a lot of important military machinery. The boys were set strategically around the railroad which they had set with a bomb to go off when the train with military machinery inside it was near. They had Axel positioned at the top of the hill with a bright flashlight to signal when the train came into view and the boys anxiously waited for this signal. Finally the boys saw the signal and were about to set off the bomb. Their cover was compromised and suddenly they were surrounded by German soldiers who immediately started shooting at them. Luffy was mortified and unable to run so Gunnar and Lars grabbed him and began to pull him away from the ruckus. Then Lars noticed that Otto was not with them and turned to see him running toward the train tracks to manually set off the bomb. Lars yelled to him to forget about it but Otto did not listen, he was insisting on setting off the bomb and ran faster for the tracks. Lars then saw Otto reach the tracks just as the train was about to reach the area that was set with bombs. Then there was a large explosion and the train fell off the tracks. The boys then all ran separate ways, Gunner went to the cafe in the woods, Axel went home, Otto ran towards the brick yard, and Lars ran to the school.
When Lars arrived at the school he went to find Irene and tell her how he truly felt about her. When he found her they sat down on a bench and he told her that he loved her. Right as Lars told Irene he would never leave her Sevend walked into the room and called to Lars, pulling him away from Irean and telling him he was under arrest. Lars was placed into a cell and the next day united with the other group members as they were marched across the camp to a black armed car. Sevend walked over to them and Gunnar asked him how he knew it was them. Sevend replied that he had found Gunnar's pipe at one of the scenes of the crime, and assumed that they had done all the other things as well. Then Sevend walked away and the boys were forced into the car with other police men and as the doors were locked and the car began to move, driving them away from their home, Otto sounded a bell to signal that he had not been captured and that he was free and safe.

I Am Rembrandt's Daughter

"I Am Rembrandt's Daughter" is a 2008, young adult historical fiction novel by Lynn Cullen about the famous artist Rembrandt van Rijn's daughter Cornelia van Rijn (1654-1684). In Cullen's version of the story, Cornelia finds that she is not Rembrandt's daughter, but rather that of Nicolaes Bruyningh, the subject of one of Rembrandt's paintings. The novel was selected by YALSA as one of the Best Books for Young Adults in 2008.
Summary.
The novel is told through a series of flashbacks describing key parts from her childhood and most of her teenage life. 
During one of the first flashbacks of the novel, Cornelia is sent upstairs to put the cat in the attic when she unrolls a picture. When she realizes that the painting is her mother, nude, she becomes ashamed of her. As her mother appears in the doorway, she runs past her.
In a flashback to her childhood, Cornelia is unknowingly introduced to her biological father. Around the age of five, Cornelia runs home crying because she has lied to her friend about having an ivory doll. When the Nicolaes, whom she calls Gold Mustache Man, walks past, she tells him what is wrong, and, some days later, she finds a doll sitting on her stoop, waiting for her. In her excitement, Cornelia runs to Rembrandt and tells him of what she has been given, but he takes the doll and sells it. Cornelia goes to her mother for comfort, which is something she does many times in the story. The day her mother dies, Cornelia goes to her mother’s room and sees her lying in bed with the spots of the plague on her. Her father tells her to leave and throws her mother’s beads at her. When Cornelia stumbles outside, the Gold Mustache Man walks towards her and when she tells him her mother is dead he runs away. 
At the beginning of the novel, Cornelia, the supposed daughter of Rembrandt, describes how she has never gotten a chance to experience the things her wealthier friends have been able to do. Throughout the story, it is shown how close Cornelia is to her older brother, Titus, and how much she would rather not be Rembrandt’s daughter. Rembrandt, Titus, and Cornelia struggle with their lack of money, though Cornelia is the only one showing her dislike for being so “lowly”. When Titus announces that he is getting married, Cornelia is filled with a sense of loss at the idea of her brother leaving her. At the wedding, she sees a handsome boy, Carel, that she has trouble tearing her gaze from, until her father makes a scene when he sees the newlyweds’ portrait. When he makes the bride spill her last drop of wine, which was bad luck, he causes the ceremony to come to a halt. Cornelia follows her father home and expresses how she feels ashamed of him. 
Cornelia sees how her father calls out for Titus to come and view his work, but he never calls for her. When Rembrandt finishes his family portrait, Cornelia and Neel realize that he has painted the innocent eyes of the baby as Titus’s. When Titus can’t figure it out, Rembrandt drops the subject. Through the rest of the book, Cornelia thinks of how the men separate themselves through their art. Cornelia wishes her father would teach her the trade, but he never looks to her as someone to learn it.
Over the days that follow the wedding, Rembrandt finishes a piece that he tries to sell. When he take Cornelia with him to a house he wants to use to sell the art, Carel answers the door and has to reject the painting. Titus makes Cornelia go back, without their father knowing, but the piece is rejected again. Carel seeing Cornelia twice, sparks something in him that makes him come to visit repeatedly throughout the story. 
Rembrandt has forbidden Cornelia to see Carel again. When Titus comes back into the picture, he announces that he and Magdalena are going to have a baby. Unfortunately, Titus becomes ill and Cornelia is forced to go shopping with Magdalena. Magdalena shows Cornelia how little she cares about those who need to make a profit when she tells her she’s going to buy twice as much fabric at a discount and then return the extra for full price. When Cornelia and Magdalena return to her home, they see Titus laying on the bed with the tokens of the plague right under his ear. At a stressful point in the waiting for Titus to pull through, Rembrandt sees the beads that were once Hendrickje’s and kicks Cornelia out to go to Nicolaes. Cornelia runs out of the house, but runs to Carel, who won’t take her in. As Cornelia backs away in tears, she bumps in Nicolaes, who takes her in to explain to her the truth about her life. 
Inside his home, he explains to her that he is her real father and that he left her mother because he had seen her posing nude for Rembrandt. When Cornelia realizes that Nicolaes never came for her because he would lose his money, she leaves and goes back to her brother. Rembrandt asks what he has told her and then tells her his side of the story and how he had promised her mother he would take care of her and Cornelia. When Titus dies, they have no money to pay for funeral bells, but for some reason they still ring. When Cornelia and Rembrandt get back to their home, they discover that Neel has paid for the bells to ring and that he does care for her and Rembrandt.
The very end of the story is told in a present tense. Cornelia is selling her father’s things when two men walk in and criticize his work, though not noticing her. When one of the men finally decides he wants a painting, she doesn’t want to sell it. Out of the back room comes Neel, who says no to selling the painting, the secret between the two being that it is Cornelia’s own original piece.
Reception.
Reviewers have commented on the novel's emotional appeal. For instance, Gillian Engberg of Booklist commented that "I Am Rembrandt’s Daughter" is “noteworthy for emotional depth," adding that it is an "absorbing romantic story." Stephanie Murphy agreed, calling it an "emotionally touching book"
The realism of the characters also impressed readers. Publisher’s Weekly noted it as "sensitively sketched first novel paints a compelling portrait of adding that it had "colorful cast." Booklist noted the novel's “heartbreaking individuals" and the author's "sensitive development of characters" and remarked that the novel is a “powerful family drama." Murphy reminded readers that it was "based on real [people."
Reviewers also pointed out the difference between this novel and most young adult fiction: its setting in a world of art history. One reviewer noted the author "uses paintings in effective ways to tether the story" and another commented on the novel’s "highly atmospheric Dutch setting."
Not all reviews were positive, however. Kirkus called the story “achingly familiar."

Provident Personal Credit Ltd is a financial services company selling loans in both the United Kingdom and Ireland, a subsidiary of Provident Financial. Its headquarters are in Bradford, West Yorkshire, and there are local Provident Personal Credit offices situated in most towns and cities throughout Ireland and the United Kingdom.
History.
Provident was founded in Bradford, West Yorkshire in 1880 by Joshua Kelley Waddilove in order to help working-class families buy the essentials that they needed. His form of credit quickly became popular and by the time Joshua died in 1920 his company, then called Provident Clothing and Supply Co, had grown into a nationwide business with 5000 Agents.
Provident Personal Credit is part of Provident Financial. Provident Financial are the sub prime loans market leaders and, as a whole, they have 11,500 self-employed Agents serving over 1.8 million customers. The company has a good reputation with 95% of their customers saying that they are satisfied with their service. ‘Indeed Provident has remained the market leader because they provide high degrees of customer satisfaction, a personal and flexible service and no penalties for missing the occasional payment’
71% of Provident Agents are women, these Agents are at the heart of the home credit service as they are the ones who collect the weekly repayments from customers.
Provident Personal Credit offers loans of small amounts, typically from £50 - £500 and are over terms from 14 weeks up to 106 weeks. The loans are unsecured and all of the costs are included up front.
The company has had to deal with bad press regarding the rate of their Representative APR; however it has been suggested that APR’s for short term loans can be misleading ‘In some ways though the APR on Provident loans are meaningless. The fact is that if you pay your loan back on time or 5 years too late, you still pay the same amount’ In addition, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation noted that ‘APRs are a very poor way of comparing the cost of different loan products at this end of the market, largely because lenders differ markedly in the way that they structure their charges. ’

Provident Personal Credit is a subsidiary of Provident Financial. Provident Financial also has another home credit subsidiary - Greenwood Personal Credit and a credit card subsidiary - Vanquis Bank.

P. J. Thomas (Indian administrative officer)

Polayil Joseph Thomas is an 1973 batch Indian Administrative Service officer from Kerala cadre. He was appointed as the 14th Chief Vigilance Commissioner of India, in an appointment that came under Supreme Court's review and later to be annulled by court as "non-est" in law. The appointment and the subsequent quashing led to several public debates with regard to the eligibility criteria for CVC's appointment, judicial activism, as well as the role played by mainstream media to hide several key facts that could establish his otherwise unblemished record in the civil services.
Early life and career.
Thomas hails from a middle-class family from Alappuzha district. A brilliant student right from his school days, Thomas is a post-graduate in Physics and later took his Masters in Economics. Thomas joined the Indian Administrative Service as one of the toppers in the Civil Services Examination in the year 1973. His elder brother, Johny Joseph, is also an IAS officer. As an IAS officer, Thomas has held important assignments in Kerala as the Chief Electoral Officer of the state, and as Secretary in Finance, Industry, Agriculture, Law and Justice and Human Resource Development Departments. As the chief electoral officer, Thomas was instrumental in introducing electronic voting machine in all stages of election. He was the founder director of the Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode. He became the Kerala Chief Secretary in 2007 and moved to the central government as Secretary in the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs in January, 2009. Later he went on to become the Telecom Secretary.
The 3G Spectrum auction happened when Thomas was the Telecom Secretary and helped the government earn a revenue two times than what analysts predicted. The 3G and broadband spectrums jointly fetched 106,000 crore Indian rupees for the government against its estimates of 35,000 crore. The success of 3G Spectrum was a big boost to the government, when it was bearing the brunt from 2G Spectrum scam, the auction for which happened before Thomas assumed the office of Telecom Secretary. While in Telecom, Thomas opposition to Devas deal was decisive for the government. Thomas had stressed that the spectrum planned by the Department of Space is crucial to meeting the strategic requirements of nation and hence it should not be frittered away by giving it to private parties and that too not without following the process of auction to maximise the government revenue. In September 2010, Mr. Thomas succeeded Pratyush Sinha, a 1969-batch IAS officer of Bihar cadre, as the CVC.
Allegations.
Palmolein Oil Import Scam.
The alleged scam of palmolein oil import happened in 1992, when K.Karunakaran was the Chief Minister of Kerala. In 1991, the state government had decided to import palm oil from Power and Energy Limited, a company based in Singapore. The price fixed for the import was 405 USD per metric tonne. The oil was imported in 1992, but the opposition, LDF, raised a stink in the deal, alleging a loss of more than 2 crores to the exchequer, by comparing the import price with the international price of palm oil which was at 392.25 USD per tonne. The role of Thomas, who was then the Secretary of Food and Civil Supplies, was to translate a cabinet decision into a government order and communicating the order to the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation.
In 1996, the LDF government came to power, and resurrected the matter by causing an FIR to be filed against Karunakaran and six others under various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Thomas was not named in the FIR, as he was not involved in the decision making or the fixing of price. Almost a year later, on 8 February 1998, Thomas’ name was added to the FIR as accused no. 8. The state government then approached the Government of India in November 1999 for sanction to prosecute Thomas for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act alleged against him. The Chief Vigilance Commissioner, however, did not grant the sanction, as the material on record did not disclose any criminal offence by Thomas. The trial court was unable to proceed with the trial of the case for the lack of sanction for the prosecution of Karunakaran, who was then a Member of Parliament, and other government servants. Following this, the state government filed an appeal to High Court, and High Court allowed the trial without the mandatory sanction for the prosecution of the accused. However, Karunakaran challenged the High Court's decision in Supreme Court, and in 2003, the Supreme Court of India upheld stay in the proceedings of the case. The case was then pending with the Supreme Court for more than a decade until the stay was lifted after Karunakaran's death in 2010. The long stay in this case eventually became detrimental to Thomas, as his appointment to the post of CVC was mired with controversies on whether the pending charge-sheet was discussed by the High Powered Committee. However, a section of the media observed that Thomas is not guilty of any wrongdoing, because the LDF government in 2006 would not have otherwise appointed him to the highest post in the state civil service, Chief Secretary to the Government of Kerala.
Appointment as Chief Vigilance Commissioner.
P.J. Thomas was appointed as the Chief Vigilance Commissioner in September 2010, by the President of India, on the recommendation of a High Powered Committee (HPC) headed by the Prime Minister of India. The selection of the new CVC was marked by controversies, after Sushma Swaraj, who was part of three-member selection committee, objected to the choice of Thomas, citing the pending charge-sheet in his name. A public interest litigation was filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation, and the HPC recommendation came under Supreme Court's review.
On March 3, 2011, the Supreme Court quashed the appointment of Thomas as the Chief Vigilance Commissioner, noting that the HPC did not consider the relevant materials on the pending charge-sheet. Though Thomas resigned after the Court's observation, he asked the President of India to seek a review petition against the court's judgement on various grounds, including the constitutionality of the judgment. The basis for the request for the review petition, according to Thomas's lawyer, Wills Mathews, was that the three judges' judgement on the CVC is not legally valid because Article 145 (3) says that the minimum number of judges required for interpretation of Constitution is five, which in effect makes the Supreme Court judgement null and void. Mathews also questioned whether the court had exercised jurisdiction on an issue in which it was not having the jurisdiction. He claimed that the Supreme Court has the power to initiate the proceeding for the removal of the CVC, only on a reference made by the President, and as such there was no reference of the President of India in the present matter. Thomas submitted that quashing the appointment resulted in miscarriage of justice not only for Thomas but to all civil servants of the country 'because the mere lodging of an FIR is sufficient to stop an honest officer from taking charge of the coveted post and shall spoil his career prospects'. The President of India however refused to consider Thomas's request for the review petition and Pradeep Kumar was appointed as the new CVC.

UEFA Euro 2020 bids

The bidding process for the UEFA Euro 2020 is the process by which the location for the 16th European Championship, commonly referred to as Euro 2020, will be selected. The process officially began on 21 March 2012 with the intent to announce the hosts in late 2013 or early 2014. Despite interest from Turkey, a joint bid from Scotland, the Republic of Ireland and Wales and a proposal from Georgia and Azerbaijan, UEFA announced on 6 December 2012 that it had made the unprecedented decision to host the tournament in multiple cities across Europe.
Background.
Euro 2020 will be the second tournament to involve 24 nations, following UEFA Euro 2016 four years previously.
Initial bidding process.
It was initially envisaged that the tournament would be contained within one, two or three countries. In the case of multiple countries hosting the tournament, these countries would have to share a border. Assuming no changes from the Euro 2016 bidding process, the basic hosting requirements were to be as follows:
Schedule.
On 21 March 2012, UEFA announced that the bidding process would be as set out below in the event that more than one expression of interest in bidding was received by UEFA before 15 May 2012. Without a second bid, UEFA stated that the hosts would be confirmed on 15 May, subject to the confederation receiving the necessary guarantees. On 16 May 2012, UEFA announced that, because more than one national association had submitted their interest, it would begin its formal selection process and would allow any of the 54 national federations to bid, even if they chose not to declare an interest prior to the deadline. The timeline for the rest of the procedure was announced by UEFA on 30 June 2012.
Expressions of interest.
Turkey, a joint Scottish, Irish and Welsh bid and an Azerbaijani-Georgian bid all formally confirmed their interest in hosting Euro 2020 with UEFA in the spring of 2012.
By and large, this was seen as a disappointing group of hosts to select from, especially as favourite for the bid Turkey favoured a bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics in its largest city Istanbul, held in the same year and seen as an obstacle to the hosting of Euro 2020.
UEFA President Michel Platini was previously reported to have promised the tournament to Turkey.
The Celtic bid was a late bid that arose after the lack of interest throughout the rest of Europe, Turkey aside.
The Azerbaijani-Georgian coalition was doubted by some due to Azerbaijan's preference for a successful Baku bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics. On 15 May 2012, hours after the announcement of the three-way Irish, Scottish and Welsh bid, Georgian Sports Minister Vladimir Vardzelashvili announced his country's intention to declare an interest in hosting Euro 2020 alone. Nine days later, however, Azerbaijan notified UEFA that they planned to join forces with Georgia in a bid for Euro 2020 after Baku failed to make the IOC's shortlist as a contender to bid for the 2020 Olympic Games. 
Several other nations made a less committed effort to the host the tournament, but never announced a firm interest. Among these were Belgium, a joint Bosnia and Herzegovina–Croatia–Serbia bid, a proposal from Romania alongside either Bulgaria or Hungary and sole bids from Germany and the Netherlands.
Change to pan-European tournament format.
On 30 June 2012, at a press conference a day before the UEFA Euro 2012 Final, UEFA President Michel Platini suggested that instead of having one host country (or joint hosting by multiple countries), Euro 2020 may be spread over "12 or 13 cities" across the continent. UEFA already use a similar system for the UEFA Under 17 Championship's 'Elite Round' where each of the seven groups is hosted by a different country. On 6 December 2012, UEFA announced that the 2020 championships would be held in multiple cities all over Europe to mark 60 years of the tournament's existence. Platini reasoned that this was the logical decision at a time of financial difficulty across Europe.
Venue selection.
On 25 January 2013, the UEFA Executive Committee approved the principles of venue selection:
In May 2013, UEFA President Michel Platini announced that his personal priority was to have the competition hosted at venues that have never hosted European Championship matches before.
Expressions of interest.
The deadline for expressions of interest was 12 September 2013. On 20 September, UEFA confirmed expressions of interest from 32 football associations to act as host cities. Of the FAs which have applied to host EURO 2020, 19 associations have not previously hosted the final stages of tournament, "(labeled with *)". Whilst neither Croatia or Serbia have hosted an international football tournament as independent countries, the Serbian and Croatian capitals both hosted finals matches for Euro 1972 as part of then Yugoslavia. 
Expressed interest in bidding for Finals Package and Standard Package
Expressed interest in bidding for Finals Package
Expressed interest in bidding for Standard Package
Withdrawn interest.
The Finnish Football Association withdrew its bid on 4 March 2014 as redevelopments to its chosen venue, the Helsinki Olympic Stadium, will leave it below the standards required to host matches at the tournament. The Czech Football Association also withdrew its candidacy in March 2014 citing that the government was not ready to provide the guarantees for building a new stadium. 
The Italian Football Federation withdrew Milan's San Siro Stadium after selecting Rome's Stadio Olimpico as the country's sole venue to host Euro 2020 matches.
Several federations withdrew their bids in late April 2014, before the final dossiers were submitted on 25 April. Four nations who had hosted recent tournaments - Euro 2008 hosts Switzerland (St. Jakob-Park, Basel), Euro 2012 co-hosts Poland (National Stadium, Warsaw and Silesian Stadium, Katowice) and Ukraine (Olympic Stadium, Kiev), and Euro 2016 hosts France (Stade des Lumières, Lyon) - withdrew after deciding that their chances of success were minimal. Despite being favourites to host the final, Turkey withdrew its bid to host the final at the Ataturk Stadium in Istanbul in favour of bidding to host Euro 2024. 
In addition, other withdrawn bids included: both Portuguese bids, at the Estádio da Luz and Estádio do Dragão, due to lack of support from local councils; the bid from the Czech Football Association in Prague due to lack of financial guarantees from city authorities; the Croatian Football Federation's bid in Zagreb, due to financial problems; Armenia; Greece; Kazakhstan; and Serbia.
Bidding venues.
On 26 April 2014, UEFA announced that there were two bids for the Finals Package (of which one will be successful) and 19 bids for the Standard Package (of which 12 will be successful) with a final decision still expected in September 2014.
Voting procedure.
The voting procedure of the venues was approved by the UEFA Executive Committee on 13 May 2014:
The voting will be done by secret ballot and Executive Committee members which are associated with the bidding associations will not be allowed to vote.
The announcement ceremony of the selected venues will take place at the Espace Hippomène in Geneva on 19 September 2014.

Rick Genest

Rick Genest (born August 7, 1985) is a Canadian artist, actor, and fashion model born in Lasalle, Montreal. He is also known as Zombie Boy for the skeletal tattoos covering the majority of his body.
Personal life.
Before he had any tattoos, Genest was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor. Genest was on the waiting list for 6 months, where he contemplated his own life and possible death, before undergoing the surgery with minimal complications..
Leaving his house one day, Genest went for a walk and decided to live downtown, on rooftops and in dumpsters or under bridges. Hitchhiking became his main method of transportation. According to his video, he started living "an anarchistic lifestyle". He claims to have already been introduced to punk rock, the punk scene and freak shows before his decision to tattoo himself.
Career.
Tattooed as a living skeleton, Rico the Zombie also worked in various sideshows and freakshows across Canada as an illustrated man, fakir, geek, as well as self declared clown. Not long after beginning his facial tattoos, Rico was first introduced to the public on November 13, 2006 in a blog post by Shannon Larratt on BME's ModBlog, which was followed in March 2008 by his first interview, by which time his iconic tattoos were largely completed. In this interview Rick clarified that he preferred the moniker "Zombie" to "Skullboy", as BME had been referring to him. The introductions on RzyM's Channel led to increasingly mainstream media coverage, notably a June 2008 feature in 'Bizarre' magazine. In the 2009 made for TV movie "Carny", starring Lou Diamond Phillips as a small town sheriff, Rico was seen as a Tattooed Man at the Carnival. Following, he was again discovered by Marc Quinn, in Bromont, Quebec, where Rico was working the sideshow at Carnival Lune Blue during the summer 2010.
On March 5, 2010, a Facebook fan page was created about Genest's unusual choice of tattoos. This page reached 1,526,292 members (as of November 19, 2011) and ultimately led to his discovery by Lady Gaga's fashion director Nicola Formichetti.
On January 19, 2011, Rico was featured in the new Thierry Mugler Autumn/Winter men's collection, headlining it on the brand's website, after his discovery by Formichetti, also Mugler's creative director. It was Rico's discovery and Gaga's urging which actually resulted in the menswear show, something not originally planned. His discovery also influenced Formichetti on the collection itself. The show was accompanied by a video featuring Rico shot by fashion photographer Mariano Vivanco. He later featured alongside Lady Gaga in the fashion show for the women's 2011 Autumn/Winter line.
On February 27, 2011, Rico was featured in Lady Gaga's video for "Born This Way", with Lady Gaga wearing makeup to replicate Genest's tattoos.
Rico can be seen styled in Mugler by Formichetti and shot by Mariano Vivanco in the sixth volume of "Vogue Hommes Japan", the editorial being titled "Hard To Be Passive". In the Spring/Summer issue of "GQ Style" (UK), Formichetti and he are interviewed, with Rico shot in Mugler by Karim Sadli for the editorial.
In late 2011, Rico became part of a campaign entitled "Go Beyond the Cover", promoting Dermablend professional makeup products, appearing in a video where a makeup team covered all the tattoos on his head, torso, arms, and part of his back in its concealer product. The advert then shows him sitting with the phrase "How do you judge a book?". He then proceeds to remove portions of the makeup, starting with a section of his chest to reveal the tattoo underneath, continuing to his face. The video then shows the process of applying the cover up played backwards. The commercial success of this campaign led to a 2-year endorsement contract with L'Oreal for Rico, who became its first ever male spokesperson.
Zombie Boy also appeared in the music video of the Polish pop singer "Honey". The video for her song ""Sabotage"" was released on 19 Jan 2012.
For the 2012 San Diego Comic Con, the Tonner Doll Company produced "Zombie Boy", a limited edition character figure in Rico's likeness. He was Tonner's guest at the convention as well. Included with each doll is a certificate of authenticity signed by Genest (as "Rico the Zombie"). The edition was limited to 400 dolls, all of which were sold as of July 27, 2012.
In September 2012 Zombie Boy became the face of the iconic Jay-Z music fashion label Rocawear for its re-launch in Europe.
He was cast as the character Savage in the film 47 Ronin, which was released in late 2013. The big budget samurai fantasy action film stars Keanu Reeves.
Rico recently collaborated with British solo artist KAV on the single "Dirty Rejects" released May 21, 2013. They spent the first part of 2013 recording an album project in Los Angeles, which is due for launch later in the year.

<doc id="31080603" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31080603" title="Digital negative (transparency)">
Digital negative (transparency)

The digital negative is a new technology which allows photographers to use digital files to create negatives on transparency film. These negatives can be used to contact print, or in some cases if the negative is made large enough (about 4x5") they can be enlarged. It is different from the Digital negative (DNG) file format, although this format may be used to create the digital images.
Creation of Digital Negatives.
Before creating a digital negative it is important to know the process to which it will be applied. Since contemporary inks and printers cannot cover a gamut as wide as traditional silver negatives and it is imperative that each process have its own tonal curve to apply to a photograph so that the photographer can take full advantage of its gamut. Also, different processes react to colors in different ways; sometimes photographers print out a monochromatic negative in a specific color to get a specific contrast range. For example, some use purple inks and low contrast curves for the small gamut of cyanotype printing, while the platinum/palladium process necessitates a high contrast curve that works best with green ink. Before the color cast is added, however, it is important to remember to invert the image to ensure that the negative prints a positive if contact printing (some also flip their image horizontally since the final print will be a mirror image of the negative), or sometimes it may be left as a positive (in the case of a positive image on a dry or wet plate).
The photographer has a number of options to create a digital negative. Usually, the process involves a lot of testing and reprinting. Chemical procedures must be standardized to allow for repeatable results. First, a tonal scale is printed out on the transparency film and this is used to create a print using whatever process is being tested. Next, the print is scanned and the resulting tones are examined either by the photographer or by a program and a new contrast curve is generated to compensate for whatever inadequacies that may exist in the first negative. The photographer may also decide here to use a different ink color. The new negative is printed and again is tested. This process may continue for as long as the photographer deems necessary. The final negative should create a final print that has both blacks and whites, and a smooth tonal range between.
Uses.
Most commonly, digital negatives are used to create contact prints. The negative is made to be the same size as the final print, and sandwiched printer ink-to-emulsion in a contact printing frame then exposed under a UV light source. They can also be used to create positives (where the initial digital file is not inverted) to make positives on emulsions such as collodion processes. Or, they can be used to create negatives that will be enlarged and used to create traditional darkroom prints. The problem with this, however, is that the negative must be large, at least 4x5". The reason being that since printers cannot spray small enough drops of ink to ensure detail in smaller negatives. Small digitally printed negatives result in grainy and blurry prints.
Advantages and Disadvantages.
Digital negatives offer many advantages. Photographers can enjoy the ease of shooting with a digital camera and editing digitally while still working with alternative or traditional photographic processes. Small, analog negatives can be scanned and enlarged digitally to create new negatives instead of using the traditional enlarging film that must be processed in a darkroom. Another advantage to digital negatives is their reproducibility: if a photographer ruins their negative with chemicals they can simply make another without having to reshoot the original negative. 
Generally, digital negatives are made from an inkjet printer using black ink only, adjusted to the proper density to suit the process. This can be achieved simply with curves or other adjustments in Photoshop, for example, or using special printer drivers (or Raster Image Processors) such as QuadToneRip. A comprehensive beginner's guide to creating digital negatives using black ink for various processes is the book "Digital Negatives" by Brad Hinkel and Ron Reeder.
If the photographer has an advanced understanding, they may use different colors in areas of an image to create contrast differences selectively when printing their negatives, similar to using colored filters on black and white film. It is, in effect, using a red filter only on the sky, and perhaps a green filter on just the grass, all at once (for example: the red filter would darken the sky and the green filter would lighten the grass). Mark Nelson's digital negative process covers this extensively.
Disadvantages to using digital negatives exist mostly because of printer limitations. As mentioned above, very small negatives tend to be blurry and grainy due to large ink droplets. Also, some inks can create banding not evident in the negative but obvious in the final print. Epson K3 Ultrachrome inks have shown to work very well in the creation of digital negatives. 
Some types of transparency film work better than others: it is important to ensure that the film does not have any agents in it that block UV since this will allow only a very small amount of necessary UV to expose the print. Some films do not respond well to inks and even after drying will smudge and smear.

Islamic Djamaat of Dagestan

Islamic Djamaat of Dagestan was an Islamist political entity in the Buynaksky District of Dagestan consisting of the fortified villages of Kadar, Karamakhi and Chabanmakhi. In the late 1990s, the Djamaat, heavily influenced by militant Wahhabism, declared independence and ejected Dagestani officials from the area. After a series of armed conflicts with Dagestani police and local moderate Muslims, the Djamaat broke off from government control. Sharia law was introduced in the villages, the Russian Constitution was declared void and an alliance was signed with Chechen forces with the aim of establishing an Independent Islamic Republic in the Caucasus. Chechnya-based militants led by warlords Shamil Basaev and Ibn Al-Khattab launched an armed invasion of Dagestan in the autumn of 1999. While the invasion was resisted by Dagestani civilians and Russian troops, a retributive military attack was launched against the Djamaat. In the ensuing fighting, the three villages were destroyed and the Djamaat's militants left the area on 15 September 1999.
Background.
Arrival of Wahhabism.
The radical Wahhabist creed of Islam arrived to Dagestan from Tajikistan in the late 1980s. Its spread was substantially sponsored by wealthy Islamist supporters in the Persian Gulf. In the early 1990s, the Dagestani Wahhabists were led by Bagaudtin Kebedov, who had previously worked with Akhmed-Kadji Akhtaev in the Islamic Party of Revival, until falling out with the more moderate Akhtaev. During the First Chechen War, Bagaudtin traveled to Chechnya to organise Wahhabist militant cells. In Dagestan he became the Amir of Islamic Community of Dagestan. Bagaudtin was the spiritual father of the Dagestani Wahhabism.
Creation of the Djamaat.
Bagaudtin Kebedov's teachings were put into practice in an area consisting of his home town Kadar, Karamakhi and Chabanmakhi in the Buinaksk District in central Dagestan southwest of the capital Makhachkala. This area became known as the Islamic Djamaat of Dagestan (a djamaat is traditional Dagestani political unit consisting of a village or group of villages). The majority of the villagers accepted the radical Wahhabist ideology, and young people from all over Dagestan and the Northern Caucasus arrived in the Djamaat in search of "pure Islam". While Bagaudtin was the spiritual leader of the djamaat, in military affairs the Arab warlord Ibn Al-Khattab, who had lived in Karamakhi before travelling to Chechnya and married a local woman, was the most influential person.
Conflicts around the Djamaat.
The Islamic Djamaat of Dagestan started receiving public attention in the later half of the 1990s, after Wahhabist extremists from the Djamaat were involved a series of violent conflicts with traditional Muslims and later—with the Dagestani government.
1996–1997: Conflict with moderate muslims.
On 21 June 1996, the administrative head of Kadar was murdered. The villagers blamed local Wahhabists, and the suspects fled to Chechnya. The incident escalated the tensions between the traditional Muslims and Djamaat's Wahhabists. On 12 May 1997, an armed conflict involving more than 450 gunmen erupted between the traditionalists and the Wahhabists at a funeral in Chabanmakhi. The Wahhabists had demanded that the participants pray toward Mecca instead of toward the coffin, which was in violation of traditional practices. 2 people died until the firing stopped, possibly due to a rumour that an army of Wahhabists were about to arrive from Chechnya as reinforcements.
The Dagestani government responded by sending hundreds of policemen and Ministry of Interior OMON special forces troops to the region to prevent further conflict. Several high-ranking officials also arrived to the scene, including Deputy Prime Minister Said Amirov. They promised that the killers would be found and prosecuted.
Alliance with Chechen militants.
In 1997, the Islamic Djamaat of Dagestan and Chechen separatists led by commander Salman Raduyev, signed an alliance with the stated goal of creating an independent Islamist state in the Caucasus. Raduyev had previously launched the deadly terrorist attack into the Dagestani town of Kizlyar. After signing the alliance, the Djamaat militants joined the International Islamic Battalion, consisting of Chechen and international Islamists led by Ibn Al-Khattab, to launch a raid against the Russian 136th Armoured Brigade in Gerlakh.
1998: Conflict with Dagestani authorities.
Tensions around the villages continued to escalate during 1998. On 21 May 1998, Wahhabist gunmen seized the police station of Karamakhi, beating two policemen and stealing weapons. Two days later, the Dagestani government responded by sending 100 Ministry of Interior troops to the area. Their aim was to take the road leading to Karamakhi, but an assault by hundreds of gunmen forced them to withdraw. The next day, on 24 May 1998, the Wahhabists deployed a small army from the villages Karamakhi, Chabanmakhi and Kadar. The militants were heavily armed, carrying grenade launchers, mortars and automatic weapons. Struggling to bring the situation under control, the Dagestani government entered negotiations with the militants. They reached an agreement according to which prisoners would be swapped and both sides would be separated. This essentially meant that the territory of the Islamic Djamaat was no longer under government control.
Declaration of independence.
On 5 July 1998, a congress attended by 1,000 armed militants was held in Karamakhi resulted in the Djamaat declaring independence and demands for the resignation of the Dagestani government, withdrawal of all federal troops and a union with Chechnya. By 10 August, the militants were controlling roads and traffic through the area, threatening to separate Dagestan's capital Makhachkala from the west of the republic. Dagestani authorities now began extensive negotiations with the militants and started to seriously consider using military force against the villages.
On 1 September 1998, an agreement was signed between the Djamaat representatives and the government of Dagestan, in which the militants agreed to "live according to the constitution", and the government agreed to let Wahhabi leaders to enforce order in the villages. On 5 September, a terrorist attack took place in Makhachkala. Apartment buildings near to the homes of the Dagestani Prime Minister and Mayor of the capital were bombed and demolished; however, no group claimed responsibility. After this, relative calm was restored, but Dagestani and Russian influence in the republic diminished. The September 1998 agreement was in effect a capitulation of the central government in favour of the Djamaat's Islamist radicals.
Description of the area.
In August 1999, a researcher from the Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies visited the Islamid Djamaat. According to him, the road leading to Karamakhi was blocked by concrete structures and flanked by high-calibre machine guns. A sign warned that the traveler was about to enter independent Islamic territory. The militants stated they would not heed to the Russian Constitution, but follow only the Koran and Sunnah. Sharia law was the only law observed in the villages. The researcher was introduced to the militants' Taliban-styled training program. Its ideological part emphasized that "anyone who carried arms must do so in the name of Allah." The military training included practice in hand-to-hand combat, use of firearms including antiaircraft guns and mountain-combat tactics.
A Finnish journalist also travelled to Karamakhi in mid-August 1999, where he interviewed some villagers and their military Commander General Dzherollak. The journalist wrote: "The Wahhabists' trucks go all over Russia. Even one wrong move in Moscow or Makhachkala, they warn, will lead to bombs and bloodshed everywhere." According to the journalist the Wahhabis had told him, "if they start bombing us, we know where our bombs will explode."
The War in Dagestan.
On 17 April 1999, a congress headed by warlord Shamil Basaev was held in the Chechen capital Grozny. The Arab warlord Ibn Al-Khattab was also present, along with several Chechen leaders. Basaev declared the formation of an Islamic army consisting of thousands of militants. According to Basaev, these forces were "necessary for the realization of the resolutions of the congress, the main purpose of which is the creation of the Independent Islamic State in the range of Chechnya and Dagestan." The troops had been trained in camps operated by Basaev, Khattab and the Wahhabist leader Bagaudtin Kebedov.
On 2 August 1999, Basaev and Khattab launched an armed invasion of Dagestan from their bases in Chechnya. Their force consisted of 2,000–3,000 militants, including Chechens and international Islamists. Basaev and Khattab had expected the Dagestani civilians to welcome them as "liberators"—however, this did not happen. Instead, the Dagestanis saw the invading force as unwelcome religious fanatics. Spontaneuous citizen militias were formed for the defence of their country. Together with Dagestani police, they managed to stop the invaders' advance. By 26 August, Basaev's and Khattab's force had withdrawn back to Chechnya.
On 29 August, Dagestani OMON troops launched a military retribution against the Islamic Djamaat of Dagestan. The Russian Air Force also bombed the area. The joined federal and Dagestani offensive was accepted by most Dagestani civilians, because the Wahhabists were widely seen as aligned with the Chechnya-base militants who had attacked civilian villages weeks before.
Terrorist bombings.
While the fighting between the Wahhabists and Dagestani troops was ongoing on 4 September, the first attack of the Russian apartment bombings occurred; 64 people were killed in a blast that destroyed an apartment building in the nearby city of Buinaksk.
A day after the blast on 5 September, Basaev and Khattab launched a second incursion into Dagestan, ostensibly with the aim of relieving the Islamid Djamaat from the government attack. On 9 September, 94 Russian civilians were killed when an explosion destroyed their apartment building in Moscow. More terrorist attacks followed: on 13 September, 118 people died in a bombing in Moscow; on 16 September, a truck-bomb destroyed an apartment building in Volgodonsk.
According to Robert Bruce Ware, a leading specialist on Dagestan, the apartment bombings were likely perpetrated by the Dagestani Wahhabists as a retribution for the federal attack on the Islamic Djamaat.
Destruction of the Djamaat.
Following the federal military attack which started on 29 August 1999, the militants retreated from the Djamaat on 13 September 1999. The villages of Karamakhi, Chabanmakhi and Kadar were ruined in the fighting. As a physical geographic entity, the Islamic Djamaat of Dagestan finally ceased to exist, but the Dagestani Wahhabists continued to have a serious presence in the republic, and there is much evidence that they have been responsible for a long series of terrorist bombings in Dagestan.

Mercury regulation in the United States

Mercury regulation in the United States is a set of laws and regulations limiting the maximum concentrations of mercury (Hg) that is permitted in air, water, soil, food and drugs. These laws and regulations are promulgated by U.S. Federal Agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, (EPA) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as well as a variety of State and local authorities.
What is mercury.
Forms of mercury.
Mercury occurs naturally in the environment and exists in a large number of forms. In pure form, it is known alternatively as “elemental” or “metallic” mercury. Mercury is rarely found in nature as the pure, liquid metal, but rather within compounds and inorganic salts. It is a shiny, silver-white metal that is liquid at room temperature, but is rarely found in this form in nature. If not sealed off, mercury slowly evaporates into the air, forming a vapor. The quantity of vapor formed increases as temperatures rise. Elemental mercury is traditionally used in thermometers and some electrical switches.
Inorganic mercury compounds or mercury salts, more commonly found in nature, include mercuric sulphide (HgS), mercuric oxide (HgO) and mercuric chloride (HgCl2). Most of these are white powders or crystals, except for mercuric sulphide which is red and turns black after exposure to light.
Organic mercury is formed when mercury combines with carbon and other elements. Examples of organic mercury compounds are dimethylmercury, phenylmercuric acetate, and methylmercuric chloride. The form most commonly found in the environment is methylmercury.
How mercury exists in the environment.
Elemental mercury in the atmosphere can undergo transformation into inorganic mercury forms, providing a significant pathway for deposition of emitted elemental mercury.
Some micro-organisms can produce organic mercury, particularly methylmercury, from other mercury forms. Methylmercury can accumulate in living organisms and reach high levels in fish and marine mammals via a process called biomagnification (i.e. concentrations increase in the food chain).
Being an element, mercury cannot be broken down or degraded into harmless substances. Mercury may change between different states and species in its cycle, but its simplest form is elemental mercury, which itself is harmful to humans and the environment. Once mercury has been liberated from either ores or from fossil fuel and mineral deposits hidden in the earth’s crust and released into the biosphere, it can be highly mobile, cycling between the earth’s surface and the atmosphere. The earth’s surface soils, water bodies and bottom sediments are thought to be the primary biospheric sinks for mercury.
Mercury speciation.
The different forms mercury exists in (such as elemental mercury vapour, methylmercury, or mercuric chloride) are commonly designated “species”. As mentioned above, the main groups of mercury species are elemental mercury, inorganic and organic mercury forms. Speciation is the term commonly used to represent the distribution of a quantity of mercury among various species.
Speciation influences the transport of mercury within and between environmental compartments including the atmosphere and oceans, among others. For example, the speciation is a determining factor for how far from the source mercury emitted to air is transported. Mercury adsorbed on particles and ionic (e.g., divalent) mercury compounds will fall on land and water mainly in the vicinity of the sources (local to regional distances), while elemental mercury vapour is transported on a hemispherical/global scale making mercury emissions a global concern. Another example is the so-called "polar sunrise mercury depletion incidence", where the transformation of elemental mercury to divalent mercury is influenced by increased solar activity and the presence of ice crystals, resulting in a substantial increase in mercury deposition during a three-month period (approximately March to June).
Moreover, speciation determines how to control mercury emissions to air. For example, emissions of inorganic mercuric compounds (such as mercuric chloride) are captured reasonably well by some control devices (such as wet-scrubbers), while capture of elemental mercury tends to be low for most emission control devices.
Sources of mercury.
The releases of mercury to the biosphere can be grouped in four categories:
The majority of atmospheric anthropogenic emissions are released as gaseous elemental mercury. The atmospheric residence time of elemental mercury is in the range of months to roughly one year. This makes transport on a hemispherical scale possible and emissions in any continent can thus contribute to the deposition in other continents. Current estimates are that less than half of all mercury deposition within the U.S. comes from U.S. sources.
Anthropogenic sources.
The largest emissions of mercury to the global atmosphere occur from combustion of fossil fuels; mainly coal in utility, industrial, and residential boilers. As much as two thirds of the total emission of ca. 2269 tonnes of mercury emitted from all anthropogenic sources worldwide in 2000 came from combustion of fossil fuels. Other anthropogenic sources of mercury include: cement production (mercury in lime), mining (iron/steel, zinc, gold), use of fluorescent lamps, various instruments and dental amalgam fillings, manufacturing of products containing mercury (thermometers, manometers and other instruments, electrical and electronic switches) and waste disposal.
Exposure to mercury.
Mercury in the air eventually settles into water or onto land where it can be washed into water. Once deposited, certain microorganisms can change it into methylmercury, a highly toxic form that builds up in fish, shellfish and animals that eat fish. The general population is primarily exposed to methylmercury through the diet (especially fish) and to elemental mercury vapors due to dental amalgams. Depending on local mercury pollution load, substantial additional contributions to the intake of total mercury can occur through air and water.
Health effects.
Almost all people have at least trace amounts of methylmercury in their tissues, reflecting methylmercury’s widespread presence in the environment and people’s exposure through the consumption of fish and shellfish. Although the presence of Mercury is quite common, most people remain below the levels that can lead to contamination or poisoning.
For fetuses, infants, and children, the primary health effect of methylmercury is impaired neurological development. Methylmercury exposure in the womb, which can result from a mother's consumption of fish and shellfish that contain methylmercury, can adversely affect a baby's growing brain and nervous system (see: "Minamata disease"). Impacts on cognitive thinking, memory, attention, language, and fine motor and visual spatial skills have been seen in children exposed to methylmercury in the womb.
Elemental (metallic) mercury primarily causes health effects when it is breathed as a vapor where it can be absorbed through the lungs. These exposures can occur when elemental mercury is spilled or products that contain elemental mercury break and expose mercury to the air, particularly in warm or poorly ventilated indoor spaces. emotional changes (e.g., mood swings, irritability, nervousness, excessive shyness); insomnia; neuromuscular changes (such as weakness, muscle atrophy, twitching); headaches; disturbances in sensations; changes in nerve responses; performance deficits on tests of cognitive function. At higher exposures there may be kidney effects, respiratory failure and death.
For methylmercury, the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) has estimated a safe daily intake level of 0.1 µg/kg body weight per day. For elemental mercury vapour, several studies show that long-term workplace exposures - at around 20 µg/m3 of air or higher – have subtle toxic effects on the central nervous system.
Environmental effects.
A very important factor in the impacts of mercury to the environment is its ability to build up in organisms and up along the food chain. All forms of mercury can accumulate in organisms. However, methylmercury is taken up at a faster rate than other forms and bioaccumulates to a greater extent. The biomagnification of methylmercury has a most significant influence on the impact on animals and humans. Fish appear to bind methylmercury strongly, nearly 100 percent of mercury that bioaccumulates in predator fish is methylmercury. Consequently, the elimination of methylmercury from fish is very slow. Given steady environmental concentrations, mercury concentrations in individuals of a given fish species tend to increase with age as a result of the slow elimination of methylmercury and increased intake due to changes in trophic position that often occur as fish grow to larger sizes.
While much is generally known about mercury bioaccumulation and biomagnification, the process is extremely complex and involves complicated biogeochemical cycling and ecological interactions. As a result, although accumulation/magnification can be observed, the extent of mercury biomagnification in fish is not easily predicted across different sites.
Several exposure pathways are possible for both plants and animals in "terrestrial" systems. The two main pathways by which terrestrial plants can be exposed to mercury are uptake from soils into the roots and absorption directly from the air. Potential exposure routes for terrestrial animals include the following: (1) ingestion of mercury-contaminated food; (2) direct contact with contaminated soil; (3) ingestion of mercury-contaminated drinking water; and (4) inhalation.
U.S. regulations to prevent mercury contamination.
Direct effects.
Use- or release-related regulations have a direct effect on sources that use mercury or release mercury into the environment. These regulations specify, for individual mercury sources, the costs and/or conditions associated with using and releasing mercury during production or disposal.
Use.
Regulations associated with mercury use in commerce impose costs, conditions, and/or restrictions associated with obtaining, selling, using, or transporting mercury. The following categories describe mercury use regulations: (1) commerce-related regulations such as taxes and transportation requirements; (2) product-related restrictions; and (3) reporting requirements.
Mercury use regulations affect only those facilities that use mercury as an input. They do not affect those sources that release mercury incidentally as a by-product.
Reporting requirements.
At a federal level, only facilities that exceed threshold planning quantities for mercury under SARA Title III regulations must report that quantity to their local emergency planning commission. EPA is currently considering a chemical use inventory, which would track the quantities of chemicals used at individual facilities.
Currently, only Michigan has regulations that specifically require facilities to report the quantities of chemicals used. Under the Part 9 rules of Act 245, Michigan's water pollution control act, businesses that use any substance listed on the "Critical Materials Registry" must report the quantities of each substance used and released. Mercury is included the Critical Materials Registry. The state uses this information to assist in permit development and compliance in its water program.
Air.
Federal.
The primary piece of federal legislation governing the airborne release of mercury in the United States is the Clean Air Act. Unlike the criteria air pollutants, mercury is classified under the Act as a hazardous air pollutant and is thus subject to control under the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP's) rather than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The key distinction is that the former is controlled by establishing performance standards under a program known as maximum achievable control technology standards (MACT), designed to reduce hazardous air pollutant emissions to a maximum achievable degree, by setting a standard at least as stringent as the emission reductions achieved by the average of the top 12% best controlled in the same pollution sources. However, as of early 2011, no federal limits of mercury from coal and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units (EGU's) were on the books. The development of a regulatory policy framework to guide the emissions of mercury from power plants is on-going, the major developments of which have occurred largely within the last decade.
The movement toward the regulation of mercury from EGU's began in December 2000, when the Environmental Protection Agency determined the regulation of coal and oil-fired EGU's to be "appropriate and necessary" under the Clean Air Act, Section 112(c) standards for mercury emissions, adding these units to the list of sources that must be regulated. This push gained further impetus in 2005, when the EPA released a report titled "The Nata Inventory Modified for the Toxics Rule 2005 Base Year", which linked 2/3's of the total amount of mercury released in 1990 to three source categories: stationary power plants, municipal waste combustors, and medical waste incinerators.
Additionally, according to the report the two latter categories saw 96% and 98% reductions of total mercury release, respectively, between the 15-year period between 1990 and 2005 while power plant emissions fell by only 10%. By 2005, coal-fired power plants made up the largest single source of airborne mercury emissions.
Given these findings, the EPA reversed its earlier decision by offering a final revision of the 'appropriate and necessary finding' for coal and oil-fired EGUs by ultimately deciding to exclude these units from the 112 list. In its place, the EPA issued a rule to permanently cap and reduce mercury emissions from stationary power facilities. The Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) was designed to reduce emissions of mercury from stationary power plants through a cap-and-trade system of regulations, with the goal of a 70% reduction, from 48 to 15 tons annually. The proposed cap was set to be phased in two distinct phases, the first set at 38 tons annually while the second phase, set to commence 2018, required a cap of 15 tons annually.
In December 2008, the D.C. Court of Appeals vacated the CAMR on the grounds that it illegally exempts utilities from the list of regulated source categories under the MACT standards. On March 16, 2011 EPA proposes Mercury and Air Toxic Standards, the first nationwide limits on coal-fired power plant emissions of mercury. Specifically, the proposal aims to reduce emissions from new and existing coal and oil-fired EGUs by 91% from current levels through national quantity-based, numerical emission limits on mercury releases. As part of this new rule, the EPA is also offering a proposal to "monitor" changes to industrial and commercial steam generating units New Source Performance Standard, but does not propose to change those emission standards. According to the EPA, the Power Plant Mercury and Air Toxics Standards are expected to have broad health benefits (due to reductions in several pollutants, not just mercury), including the prevention in the year 2016 of between 6800 and 17,000 premature deaths and 11,000 non-fatal heart attacks. The EPA has also announced public hearings throughout the month of May.
State.
Under the Title V Operating Permits program, states may impose emissions fees up to $25/ton of emissions for all chemicals. Facilities releasing mercury are subject to this fee for their mercury emissions. Without a differential fee structure, the fee alone is not likely to be high enough to spur reductions in mercury emissions. For instance, Wisconsin's largest source of mercury air emissions, an electric utility, would only pay $15.90 for its mercury releases (.63 ton @$25/ton).
Many states have operated independently from the federal EPA in setting their own emission reduction targets. In 2007, 18 states proposed more stringent abatement levels than what was proposed at the federal level at the time.
Water.
Federal.
Clean Water Act regulations specify technology-based effluent limits for classes and categories of industries, and describes the circumstances in which states may require effluent limits or monitoring requirements more stringent than technology-based standards. The Clean Water Act relies on a permit system, known as the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) to regulate water discharges. Facilities may be assigned a specific mercury discharge limit, or may only be required to monitor their discharge for mercury. Facilities report actual discharge levels in Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs), which serve as the basis for determining compliance.
Pretreatment standards regulate industries that discharge into a publicly owned treatment plant (POTW) instead of discharging directly into a receiving water body. Regulations list industrial categories subject to national categorical pretreatment standards for new and existing facilities that discharge into treatment plants. POTWs with approved pretreatment programs may set permit limits and conduct inspections of industrial users. Facilities that do not have specific pretreatment standards for mercury (or other hazardous substances), are supposed to notify the POTW of any hazardous waste discharge that exceeds 100 kg per month. Wastestreams from certain manufacturing processes that may involve mercury, such as fluorescent lamps and switchgear, are excluded from categorical pretreatment standards because they are considered dilute.
Mercury is included in the list of chemicals eligible for removal credits at a POTW. A POTW may allow a facility to discharge a higher quantity of mercury provided that the POTW meets the applicable mercury standard in its sludge without additional costs.
Under the Great Lakes Enforcement Strategy, EPA will target violations of daily maximum permit limits. This screening criteria is more stringent than the national definition of significant noncompliance, which targets violations of monthly average limits.
State.
The Clean Water Act stipulates that states should adopt specific water quality standards for their navigable waterways (streams, rivers, wetlands and lakes) and issue permits for discharge under the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System(NPDES). The standards for mercury and other pollutants are set at a level that is reasonably expected not to adversely impact the health of humans or wildlife. Legal entitlements for discharge are granted in the form of permits, but the overall allowable level of discharge is controlled by the EPA. The states may issue permits, but the allowable pollution levels must not exceed the federal standards. Additionally, both the federal EPA and the corresponding environmental regulatory offices at the state level make pertinent information publicly available, which includes the harmful effects of mercury exposure and the times of the year in which it is deemed dangerous to consume biotic organisms (e.g. consumption advisories for fish).
Waste.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
RCRA regulations outline specific classification and disposal requirements for products and wastes that contain mercury. In general, RCRA regulations are waste-specific, not source-specific, and thus may apply to any facility that generates mercury-containing wastes. Waste code identification: RCRA regulations assign specific waste codes to five types of wastes that are either "characteristic" wastes or "listed" wastes. Mercury is both a characteristic and a listed waste under RCRA. 
RCRA regulations describe specific disposal requirements for individual waste codes. All mercury-bearing wastes (wastewaters and nonwastewaters) are subject to land disposal restrictions. RCRA regulations also influence product disposal and recycling options for mercury containing products
Reporting requirements.
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act establishes emergency release, inventory, and release reporting requirements. The requirement includes the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), which requires facilities in the manufacturing sector (SIC codes 20-39) to report releases to air, water, and land for all listed chemicals, including mercury. Other sections require facilities to report spills of listed substances above a threshold reporting quantity (reportable quantities), and the quantities of chemicals stored above a specified threshold planning quantity.
Indirect effects.
Environmental management standards have an indirect effect on individual sources. Environmental standards are numeric criteria that specify a maximum acceptable mercury concentration for different media, based on scientific or risk-based criteria.
Global regulations.
Global convention.
Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution and The 1998 Aarhus Protocol on Heavy Metals.
Since 1979 the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution has addressed some of the major environmental problems of the UNECE region through scientific collaboration and policy negotiation. The Convention has been extended by eight protocols that identify specific measures to be taken by Parties to cut their emissions of air pollutants.
The Executive Body adopted the Protocol on Heavy Metals on 24 June 1998 in Aarhus (Denmark). It targets three particularly harmful metals: cadmium, lead and mercury. According to one of the basic obligations, Parties will have to reduce their emissions for these three metals below their levels in 1990 (or an alternative year between 1985 and 1995). The Protocol aims to cut emissions from industrial sources (iron and steel industry, non-ferrous metal industry), combustion processes (power generation, road transport) and waste incineration. It lays down stringent limit values for emissions from stationary sources and suggests best available techniques (BAT) for these sources, such as special filters or scrubbers for combustion sources or mercury-free processes. The Protocol requires Parties to phase out leaded petrol. It also introduces measures to lower heavy metal emissions from other products, such as mercury in batteries, and proposes the introduction of management measures for other mercury-containing products, such as electrical components (thermostats, switches), measuring devices (thermometers, manometers, barometers), fluorescent lamps, dental amalgam, pesticides and paint.
The Basel Convention.
The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal was brought into force in 1992 in order to prevent the transportation of hazardous wastes to developing countries. Over 170 countries have now joined the convention, including Australia who became a member of the Basel Convention on 5 February 1992.
The Rotterdam PIC Convention.
The Rotterdam PIC Convention is a means for formally obtaining and disseminating information so that decisions can be made by importing countries as to whether they wish to receive future shipments of certain chemicals and for ensuring compliance with these decisions by exporting countries. The Convention promotes shared responsibility between exporting and importing countries in protecting human health and the environment from the harmful effects of such chemicals and provides for the exchange of information about potentially hazardous chemicals that may be exported and imported. A key goal of the Rotterdam PIC Convention is to provide technical assistance for developing countries and countries with economies in transition to develop the infrastructure and capacity necessary to implement the provisions of the Convention. Substances covered under the Convention: Mercury compounds including inorganic and organometallic mercury compounds.
UNEP Global Mercury Negotiation and Partnership.
Global Legally Binding Instrument on Mercury.
In February 2009, the Governing Council of UNEP agreed on the need to develop a global legally binding instrument on mercury. Participation in the intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) is open to all Governments. Following the conclusion of the negotiations, the text will be open for signature at a diplomatic conference (Conference of Plenipotentiaries), which will be held in 2013 in Japan.
UNEP Global Mercury Partnership Action Priorities.
Most of the priorities for action to reduce risk from mercury have been defined within partnerships:
Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is a complex global development issue. Reaching out to individual miners is challenging, with an estimated 10-15 million artisanal and small-scale gold miners globally in approximately 70 countries. ASGM is the largest demand sector for mercury globally (estimated at 650-1000 tonnes in 2005). Low mercury and mercury free solutions are available.
Burning of coal is the largest single anthropogenic source of mercury air emissions. Coal burning for power generation is increasing. Although coal contains only small concentrations of mercury, it is burnt in very large volumes. Household burning of coal is also a significant source of mercury emissions and a health hazard. The objective of this partnership area is continued minimization and elimination of mercury releases from coal combustion where possible.
Mercury cell chlor-alkali production is a significant user of mercury and a source of mercury releases to the environment. The mercury used in this process acts as a catalyst in the chlorine production process. Best practices, such as proper waste management, can minimize the release of mercury. Mercury-free technologies are also available in chlor-alkali production.
Transition success has been demonstrated in thermometers, switches and relays, batteries other than button cells, thermostats, HID auto discharge lamps, and sphygmomanometers. Reducing mercury in products may be the most effective means to control mercury in waste. Sound management should consider all stages of the product’s life-cycle. Clear regulation can prompt manufacturers to produce mercury-free products.
Fate and transport research is important in setting and implementing national, regional and global priorities. It also helps establish baselines to monitor and assess progress on mercury reductions.
The management of mercury and mercury-containing waste is the last step in the product life-cycle. The elimination of mercury in products and processes may be the most efficient way to avoid the presence of any form of mercury in waste.
Mercury is an element and cannot be destroyed. Policies designed to decrease the production, use and trade of mercury must be accompanied by access to viable, safe and secure long term storage. Investing in supply, trade, and storage issue is more efficient than trying to control mercury release.
Toolkit for Identification and Quantification of Mercury Releases.
The "Toolkit for identification and quantification of mercury releases", the "Mercury Toolkit", is intended to assist countries to develop a mercury releases inventory. It provides a standardized methodology and accompanying database enabling the development of consistent national and regional mercury inventories. National inventories will assist countries to identify and address mercury releases.

Cubic chess

Cubic Chess is a chess variant invented by Vladimír Pribylinec beginning with an early version (named Echos) in 1977. The game substitutes "cubes" for the chess pieces, where the six faces of each cube display a different chess piece (pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, and king). This provides an efficient means (rotating the cube on a square) to change a piece's type. In 2013, manufacturing of the game started in Slovakia.
The game begins like standard chess, with a normal 8×8 chessboard, and cubes rotated so that uppermost faces reflect the standard chess starting position.
Game rules.
Cubic Chess follows the normal rules of chess (including castling, check, checkmate, etc.), but with the following special differences:
The Cubic Chess pawn does not promote when reaching the last rank.
Sample game.
"Note on notation:" When a pawn is rotated to display a new piece type, the new piece is written in parentheses, for example: 6...h7(B).

Australian Soldier Park

The Australian Soldier Park, Beersheba, Israel is dedicated for the memory of the Australian Light Horse regiment of the British Army, that conquered the town from the Turkish Empire on World War I.
The park was established in 2008 on a large area, and is maintained by a team of its own employees. On its eastern corner there is a memorial statue of a mounted Australian lighthorseman as well as documentary materiel on aluminum boards, written in three languages. The park also includes an area for picnics, gardens, artificial waterfalls, a maze, and a large playground under a circuses-tent-like shade that defends the visitors from the desert sunlight.
Most of the playground facilities are fully accessible for children who use wheelchairs. It includes slides one can climb to via a wheelchair ramp, a carousel with two regular benches and two secured places for wheelchairs, hammock and swings one can easily use without sitting straightly and without holding tight, and so on. The handicap parking is located in the middle of the park, much closer to the facilities than the rest of the parking spaces.
The currency for the park establishment summed up to three million dollars, was contributed by an Australian fund, and by the Fund for Beersheba Development.

2011 Balochistan floods

The 2011 Balochistan floods started from the last week of February and continued till the first week of March. Balochistan province was already badly affected from last year's devastating floods as UNHCR claims that 166,000 flood victims are still homeless in the province with 240 people still living in camps.
Meteorological history.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department issued a weather advisory in which it warned that a Western Disturbance over Iran was likely to enter in Balochistan that would cause widespread rains with isolated heavy rainfalls over Balochistan for four days. The system entered Balochistan on 28 February and caused widespeard heavy rainfall in the province whereas moderate rainfall elsewhere in the country. The system moved and entered India on 5 March.
Flooding and impact.
Hundred people were rendered homeless when a large number of houses were washed away by flash floods caused by torrential rain in Quetta and other areas in northern and central Balochistan. Traffic between Ziarat and Loralai via Sanjavi was suspended after heavy snowfall in the valley as four feet of snow fell in the hilly areas of Ziarat and about six inches in the town in 24 hours. At least 70 houses were washed away by hill torrents in Nushki and over a dozen houses collapsed in Huda and Khrotabad areas of Quetta. Floodwaters entered a large number of houses. Parts of Chagai district were also affected. The Bour Nullah entering Nushki from Afghanistan inundated thousands of acres of land in Dak area. At least 25 mud-houses were washed away in Chagai tehsil. A bridge on the Quetta-Karachi National Highway was washed away near Mastung.
On February 28 the provincial capital was lashed by strong hailstorms followed by heavy rainfall. During the six day wet spell the highest rainfall in 24 hours was that was recorded on March 1, 2011.
Heavy precipitation during late February and early March.
Heavy precipitation recorded during the six day wet spell of February 28 to March 5, 2011 in the province based on data from the Pakistan Meteorological Department.
Response by the Pakistan Government.
Minister for Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Babu Mohammad Rahim Mengal said a relief operation had been launched. The minister in charge of the PDMA visited the affected area in Nushki and said 200 blankets, 200 tents and food items had been sent to Nushki and Chagai districts. Balochistan Chief Minister Nawab Aslam Raisani ordered the officials concerned to immediately send relief goods for the affected people. He said relief camps would be set up in government buildings for displaced people.

Defensive Organization of Corsica

The Defensive Organization of Corsica ("Organization Défensive de la Corse") was the French military organization that in 1940 was responsible for the defense of the French island of Corsica against a potential invasion by Fascist Italy. As part of the overall effort to fortify France's borders which included the Maginot Line, the fixed Corsican defenses were constructed in parallel with the Maginot Line, using the same organizational structure and similar designs, albeit scaled back in size, cost and fighting power. The Corsican defenses were designed to deter an Italian landing on the south end of Corsica, and to support artillery batteries capable of controlling the Strait of Bonifacio between Corsica and the Italian island of Sardinia, separated by only twelve kilometers. As World War II unfolded, no attempt was made by Italian forces to mount an opposed landing on Corsica. The island was instead occupied after the armistice of 25 June 1940. In 1943 Corsica saw fighting when German forces moved from Sardinia. Most of the fortified positions remain to the present day.
Concept and organization.
During the inter-war period, Corsica's defenses were first examined in 1926, when General Debeney requested a study of the island's defenses from Vice-Admiral Salaun, the French Navy chief of staff. The island was only twelve kilometers from the Italian island of Sardinia across the Strait of Bonifacio, and was regarded as weakly defended. Salaun's report indicated that the island's capital, Ajaccio, was relatively well-defended by old 120mm field guns, but that the areas on Bonifacio in the south and Bastia in the north were vulnerable to amphibious assault. Both attack and defense would be hampered by the island's poorly developed road network. Bonifacio, the closest point to Sardinia, could control the straits and provide a means of counterattacking Italian territory. In 1928 Bonifacio received five batteries of mounting a total of eight 190mm guns and six 95mm guns, both types of late 19th-century manufacture. At the same time, two 340mm gun turrets were proposed for Bonifacio, similar to those eventually installed at Battery Cepet in Toulon and at Bizerte in Tunisia. The 200 million franc cost of these batteries caused the turret project to be placed in a low-priority status.
General Fournier, in charge of Corsican defenses in 1932, was directed by the Ministry of War on 13 April 1928 to prepare a defensive plan for the island. Fournier prepared an ambitious plan, proposing roads, airfields, telephone communications and other measures, which were projected to cost as much as 6 billion francs. Fournier was told to make do with 42 million francs. Exercises in 1929 showed up the vulnerability of Bonifacio, prompting Fournier to propose a 10 million franc program to defend the southern beaches and the roads near Bonifacio. However, while the French Senate was amendable to funding, none was provided, and the 42 million franc program was cut from the 1930 budget.
Bonifacio's defenses were augmented in October 1932 with eight 194mm guns in the town's citadel, four 138mm guns and four 75mm anti-aircraft guns at Bocca-di-Valle, four 145/155 guns at Sotta and six 164mm guns at Monte-Léone. Many of these weapons had sufficient range to fire across the straits., particularly the guns at Sotta, which had a range of . These open emplacements lacked close-range defenses and were vulnerable to a landing behind the main artillery line. However, from 1931 the "Commission d'Organisation des Régions Fortifiés", or CORF, was directed to advise on the defense of Corsica. The same year, a proposal was approved by the Army and Navy to fortify Corsica. The programme included improvements to infrastructure, with new roads and telephone communications, as well as the construction of casemates and "ouvrages" around Bonifacio. Costs were estimated in 1933 at 27 million francs, about half of which was to be spent on fortifications, with the remainder devoted to roads and communications.
Construction.
Construction of the CORF positions began in 1932, concentrating on the southern end of Corsica with three objectives: fortification of beaches suitable for the landing of an invasion force, control of the road between Porto-Vecchio and Bonifacio, and defense of the Pertusato plateau behind Bonifacio, site of several of the artillery batteries. A total of twelve infantry casemates and three artillery casemates were completed in 1932-1933. 
CORF was disestablished at the end of 1935. As war with Italy and Germany threatened in 1939, new measures were proposed for Corsican defenses. 5.4 million francs were allocated to improve the defenses of Bastia, building two casemates and two blockhouses. In the south, fifteen infantry shelters or "abris" were built in the Corpo-de-Verga area, known as the "Mollard Line," named after the island's military commander. These positions were built by the Military Works Arm ("Main d'Oeuvre Militaire", or MOM), which was responsible for many hastily-built fortifications of the immediate pre-war period.
Command.
Corsica was under the overall command of the General Mollard. Mollard's troops included the 363rd Infantry Demi-Brigade ("363e Demi-Brigade d'Infanterie") (363 DBI) with four (later three) battalions, the 373rd Alpine Infantry Demi-Brigade ("373 Demi-Brigade Alpine d'Infanterie") (373e DBIA) with seven battalions, and the 43rd Squadron of the 10th Dragoons Regiment (cavalry) ("43e Escadron du 10e Régiment de Dragons"). Another three or four battalions from various units rounded out the force, supported by the 92nd Artillery Group.
Description.

History.
Corsica was not directly attacked by ground forces in 1940. Between 15 June and 20 June the Italian Air Force bombed Propriano, Porto-Vecchio, Bonifacio and Calvi, with little effect. Corsica was occupied by Italian forces after the armistice of June 25, 1940, but remained French territory under the Vichy French government. During the fighting of 1943, in which German forces moved from Sardinia to Corsica and then to Sicily, the Georges-Ville casemate was destroyed and the casemates at Ventilègne and Catarello were damaged. The artillery casemates' 75mm guns were salvaged after the war and sent to re-arm positions in the Fortified Sector of the Maritime Alps.
Present status.
The casemates at Rondinara, Santa Manza and other locations are reported to be in good condition and accessible.

Charles Guillou

Charles Fleury Bien-aimé Guilloû (1813–99) was an American military physician. He served on a major exploring expedition that included both scientific discoveries and controversy, and two historic diplomatic missions. He ran a hospital in the Hawaiian Islands, before returning to the US.
Life.
Charles Fleury Bien-aimé Guilloû was born in Philadelphia on July 26, 1813.
His father was Victor Gabriel Guilloû (1776–1841), who had escaped from the French Revolution and fought in the Haitian Revolution. His father introduced him to Marquis de Lafayette when he visited the US in 1824. Guilloû attended a military academy and then graduated from the University of Pennsylvania medical school in 1836. During 1836, he visited his father, who had moved to Cuba to start a sugar plantation after running a dance academy in Philadelphia.
Exploration.
On February 9, 1837, Guilloû was appointed assistant surgeon for the in the United States Navy.
It was one of the ships sent on the United States Exploring Expedition commanded by Charles Wilkes, although it was 1838 before the squadron could depart. After a dispute with Cadwalader Ringgold, he was transferred to the . He befriended young midshipman William Reynolds, whose journals provide a non-official version of the events of the voyage. In December 1839, the squadron headed farther south, and in January 1840 provided the first sighting of the continent of Antarctica by a US Navy ship. Guilloû provided a sketch when the "Peacock" was stuck in the ice. They returned to Sydney for repairs, before resuming exploration.
Wilkes' imperious manner included dismissing many of the officers, leading to further low morale. Guilloû attended to sailors injured by frequent floggings. In September 1841 the squadron arrived in Honolulu in the Hawaiian Islands to spend the winter. The three-year planned time of the voyage was over, and several members requested to leave. Wilkes insisted on reading all journals and letters. When Guilloû removed some pages from his journal, saying they were of a personal nature, Wilkes suspended Guilloû and prepared charges for various offenses. After the "Peacock" was lost in July 1841 while exploring the Pacific Northwest, Guilloû was shuttled between various ships, officially under arrest.
On his return in 1842, Guilloû helped organize the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery under William P. C. Barton.
He was sentenced to dismissal at the court-martial trials in 1843 related to the Wilkes expedition, but President John Tyler reduced the sentence to a year suspension.
Guilloû filed seven charges against Wilkes, including questioning his claim to have "discovered" Antarctica. Wilkes was found guilty of only one: illegal punishment. Wilkes was sentenced to a public reprimand.
Diplomacy.
After being reinstated, Guilloû served on the , under Commodore James Biddle. In June 1845 the ship was sent to Guangzhou (then known as Canton), on a diplomatic mission with the first treaty between the US and China. It then visited Japan. When returning via Honolulu, at the outbreak of the Mexican-American War, the "Columbus" was recalled to Monterey, California and the ranch of William A. Richardson. Guilloû met John Sutter, and spoke French with the Swiss native on July 4, 1847; a year later the discovery of gold near Sutter's mill would spark the California Gold Rush. On August 28, 1847 he was promoted to the rank of full Navy Surgeon. The "Columbus" returned to Hampton Roads in March 1848. 
Guilloû was then assigned to the which took another diplomatic trip, this one to Europe.
On July 30, 1849, while at Gaeta, the multilingual Guilloû acted as interpreter for a visit to the palace of King Ferdinand II by local diplomat John Rowan. They also met Cardinal Giacomo Antonelli, who was secretary of state for the Papal States. On July 31 they visited Pope Pius IX, and invited him and Ferdinand to visit the ship, with Guilloû again interpreting.
On August 1, Ferdinand and Pius had their formal visit to the "Constitution". Pius began to feel ill, and Guilloû treated him for seasickness. The grateful pope delivered rosaries to the Catholics on the ship; Guilloû received inscribed prayerbooks and a medalion, along with a plenary indulgence. The visit, however, proved to be a diplomatic embarrassment for the US, which was officially neutral in the Italian revolutions that were happening at the time. A visit to a navy ship was considered equivalent to stepping on "US territory", which had never been done before by a pope. Captain John Gwinn died before he could be formally reprimanded.
On his return, Guilloû was stationed at the Brooklyn Naval Shipyard from 1852 to 1854. He married Dinah Postlethwaite (1815–85), daughter of Samuel Postlethwaite (1772–1824) from Natchez, Mississippi in September 1852. They had one daughter, Margaret Acelie Guilloû (born September 13, 1853), who married George Alfred Blackmore. They also adopted Eloise ("Polly") Thibault.
Hawaii.
Guilloû sailed to Honolulu in 1854. He first tried to establish a hospital with Robert W. Wood, but that failed.
Active in Freemasonry, he helped reactivate Lodge Le Progrés de l'Océanie in Honolulu that had been chartered from the French organization.
He was an early member of the Hawaiian Agricultural Society.
He evidently decided to stick to medicine, since in 1856, he was one of the founding members of the Hawaiian Medical Society, with other prominent doctors such as Gerrit P. Judd and Thomas Charles Byde Rooke.
In 1857 Darius A. Ogden, the American Consul to the Kingdom of Hawaii, appointed him as the Honolulu U.S. Seamen's Hospital physician in 1857.
On April 23, 1858, he gave a speech proposing to improve health care for native Hawaiians by opening a hospital.
Although the plan would later be adopted, the resulting Queen's Hospital (now the The Queen's Medical Center) would pass up Guilloû and appoint German William Hillebrand to head the new institution.
Guilloû was appointed by Victor Emmanuel II of Italy as the Consul of Italy to the Kingdom of Hawaii while he was there.
The State Department suspected overcharging for the seaman's hospital.
Commander William E. Hunt in of the was sent to investigate.
James W. Borden, the new United States Minister to Hawaii, published letters in the "Pacific Commercial Advertiser" newspaper of Henry Martyn Whitney with accusations against Guilloû and Abner Pratt, the American Consul who replaced Ogden.
Pratt had already headed back to Marshall, Michigan where he built a majestic mansion, while the "Levant" was lost at sea.
Although Pratt was asked to return the funds, the American Civil War caused the government to never pursue the case.
By 1861, the Seamen's Hospital was run by Seth Porter Ford (1817–1866).
Young Prince Albert Edward Kauikeaouli Kaleiopapa became ill in August 1862. Guilloû was one of many physicians called in to help, but they could do nothing and the young prince died, leading to a series of succession crises.
He returned to the US in 1867. He lived for a while in Petersburg, Virginia, and then New York City.
Death and legacy.
Guilloû died on January 2, 1899 in New York of pneumonia.
He wrote a book of his reminiscences (never published), and took many sketches during his travels.
His sketches of Oregon and California were published in 1961.
Grandson Charles Thomas Blackmore was born July 3, 1888, joined the British army in World War I, and died on June 16, 1915 in the Battle of Bellewaarde.
His widow donated Guilloû's papers to the College of Physicians of Philadelphia in 1974.
Some of his effects such as medals are on display at the museum there.
Grandson Philip Guillou Blackmore was born January 18, 1890 in Virginia and entered the Virginia Military Institute in 1908.
After graduating, he was commissioned into the coast artillery of the US Army on December 20, 1911. During World War I he also went to Hawaii, where he served at Fort Kamehameha and rose to be commander of Fort Ruger. During World War II he rose to the rank of temporary brigadier general. In August 1947 he assumed command of the White Sands Proving Ground. He married Emily Van Patten and had four children.
He retired in 1950 and died April 7, 1974.

Funkytown (film)

Funkytown is a 2011 Canadian drama film directed by Daniel Roby and written by Steve Galluccio.
Set in Montreal during the disco era, the film revolves around the Starlight, a fictionalized version of Montreal's famed Lime Light discothèque. It depicts this world starting in 1976, when Montreal was considered one of the world's top nightclub destinations, through to 1980, when the fashion for disco was about to experience a sharp decline. By the early 1980s political issues such as Quebec's 1980 independence referendum had fractured and polarized the city, and Montreal had also begun to experience a decade of economic decline. By then, it had ceased to be the largest city in Canada, and had ceased as well to be Canada's financial and industrial centre.
Some scenes of the film were in fact shot inside, outside and in the surroundings of the building which had housed the Lime Light, at 1258 Stanley Street. It now houses the premium strip club "Chez Parée" and the dance club "La Boom".
Cast.
Raymond Bouchard stars as Gilles Lefebvre, a record producer and impresario who runs the club with his son Daniel (François Létourneau). Paul Doucet stars as Jonathan Aaronson, a flamboyant gay radio, television and fashion personality and trendsetter (a fictionalised version of Douglas Coco Leopold). Patrick Huard stars as Bastien Lavallée, an influential radio and television personality whose dance music shows play a key role in promoting the city's disco scene. Lavallée is a fictionalized version of real-life Montreal radio and television personality Alain Montpetit.
The cast also includes Geneviève Brouillette (as Mimi, a former "Gogo" singer now down on her luck), Justin Chatwin (as Tino, a young Italian waiter and disco dancer), Romina D'Ugo (as Tino's girlfriend), Sophie Cadieux (as Helene, Daniel Lefebvre's secretary), and Sarah Mutch (as Adriana, a model who wants to become a disco singer).
Language.
Like the 2006 film "Bon Cop, Bad Cop", the film features dialogue in both English and French. For French audiences the English dialogue is subtitled, while for English audiences the French dialogue is subtitled.
The film has faced some controversy for its mixture of languages, with one journalist for "La Presse" accusing it of being essentially an English film with only token dialogue in French, rather than a truly bilingual film.

Battle of Curuzú

The Battle of Curuzu happened between September 1 and September 3 in 1866 in the context of Paraguayan War.
After the first Battle of Tuiuti, won by the Allies on May 24 in 1866, commander of the reserves Mitre took ten thousand men brought by the baron of Porto Alegre and decided to attack the batteries in the Curuzu Fort and Fort Curupaiti, south of the main stronghold of Humaitá on the shores of Paraguay River.
On September 1, at 7:30 in the morning the Brazilian squad, with battleships "Bahia", "Barroso", "Lima Barros", "Rio de Janeiro" and "Tamandaré" in front, facing the Curuzu fort, plus cannonry "Mage" in front of Palmar island, along with the wooden ships "Greenhalgh", "Beberibe", "Belmonte", "Araguari", "Ipiranga", "Parnaíba" and "Ivaí". The shootout between the fort and ships lasted four hours. Meanwhile the timber ships landed 800 soldiers in the Chaco, to destroy the base from which the Paraguayan launched fireships and fired artillery against the Brazilian warships. With nightfall the bombardment was stopped.
The next day, at 14:00, the battleship "Rio de Janeiro" hit two mines and sank immediately along with her commander Américo Brasílio Silvado and more than 50 sailors. An hour later the Baron de Porto Alegre, had already landed and gathered more than 8,000 men, infantry, cavalry, artillery and sappers in "Guardia del Palmar". Despite having encountered resistance, they succeeded in repulsing the enemy and prepare for the next day ground attack.
On September 3, the fort, commanded by Colonel Jimenez, was stormed. The defenders relied on the advantage of the wetlands and bushes around the fort. The fort was conquered after a heavy bombardment, and the Paraguayan army was pursued until the vicinity of Curupaiti.

Canarian Nationalist Party

The Nationalist Canary Party (PNC) is a nationalist political party in the Canary Islands. Its current headquarters are in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Tenerife.
Precedents.
The first PNC (CNP) was founded in Havana, Cuba on January 30, 1924, by Jose G. Cabrera Díaz, a canarian journalist who became president of the party. He had been a trade union leader of Canary workers. On August 5, 1900, they had founded the Working Canary Association. In the 1920s, Díaz left his working class roots to defend the interests of the middle class. Though the Cuban PNC proclaimed itself as inheritor of Secundino Delgado's thought, the party ideology was far away from the near to anarchism ideas of national and social liberation by Delgado.
The newspaper "El Guanche", founded in 1897, was a primary supporter of the party. The party adopted as Canary flag, the "Flag of the Ateneo" (also called "Secundino's Flag"), that is to say, with seven white stars on a blue background arranged to match the position of the country's various islands.
History.
In 1982, the newly created PNC held its first congress in the Canary Islands. The party adopted as symbols the 1970's MPAIAC flag, apart from the "Ateneo Flag", as well as some of the Cuban PNC political positions.
In 1993, the party merged with others to form Canarian Coalition (CC), but left the group in 1998. In 2003, after tensions between the militants and the direction, a splinter group formed another "Partido Nacionalista Canario", known as PaNaCa, which accused PNC of betraying its nationalist reivindications. Finally, PaNaCa joined CC.

Charles Victor Naudin

Charles Victor Naudin (born 14 August 1815 in Autun - died 19 March 1899 in Antibes) was a French naturalist and botanist.
Biography.
Naudin studied at Bailleul-sur-Thérain in 1825, at Limoux, and at the University of Montpellier from which he graduated in 1837. The following year he was working as a private tutor; he obtained his doctorate in 1842. He taught until 1846, when he joined the herbarium of the National Museum of Natural History. He collaborated with Augustin Saint-Hilaire on the publication of the Brazilian flora and introduced the first seeds of "Jubaea chilensis" in France.
He taught at Chaptal College as professor of zoology, but a neurological disease left him deaf. He became an assistant naturalist in 1854 and married in 1860. He entered the Academy of Sciences in 1863 where he succeeded Horace Benedict Alfred Moquin-Tandon. He moved to Collioure in 1869 and created a private experimental garden there. In 1878 he was appointed director of the botanical garden of Villa Thuret of Antibes (now an INRA laboratory). He worked closely with Jacques Nicolas Ernest Germain de Saint-Pierre.
He was losing his sight. In spite of this he continued to run experiments on hybridization and the acclimation of plants for the production of new species. He studied heredity, and the flora of Brazil, and in 1860 he described twenty kinds of pumpkins.
Both Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel studied his work, which is considered a precursor of modern genetics.
Bibliography.
His main publication is "Mémoire sur les hybrides du règne végétal" which appeared in "Recueil des savants étrangers" and won him the Grand Prize of the Institute of Botany in 1862. The study of hereditary phenomena according to his designs is now known as "Naudinism", which asserts that species are formed in the same way as our cultivated varieties, whose formation Naudin attributed to systematic selection by Man. He did not explain how selection acts in nature.
He was interested in the diversification of plants and in particular of pumpkins. Contrary to the generally accepted view, he established the non-permanence of hybrids. The botanist also published a series of memoirs dealing with cosmic influences, and published numerous articles in the "Journal of Horticulture". He worked on various treaties and codes of agriculture and horticulture.
His handbook "Manuel de l'acclimateur" (Paris, 1888) is a reference work on the acclimatization of the Riviera in the 19th century. During his stay in Collioure, he participated in the planting of palms, including two Washingtonia, at the villa of the Baron de Saint Malo Vilmarest in Argeles-sur-Mer.

Indochinite Tektites are solidified rock, which were fired into the Earth's upper atmosphere by a meteorite impact and subsequently cooled to form the distinctive glass-like structure. Indochinite Tektites are distinctly dark black in contrast to the green of European Moldavite Tektites. It is estimated that these bodies of solidified magma are 700,000 years old. Indochinite tektites, as the name suggests, are found in the Indochinese peninsula, from Australia and the Pacific islands of Micronesia in the east and south, to China and Indonesia in the north and west. The largest indochinite was a Muong-Nong type tektite (which are layered tektites), which had a mass of 29.0 kg.

<doc id="31081475" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31081475" title="Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act (SAFETY Act) of 2002">
Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act (SAFETY Act) of 2002

'"The SAFETY Act
(Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act) of 2002"' 
is part of the Homeland Security Act under Public Law 107-296. 
What is the SAFETY Act?
The SAFETY Act is a little-known and often misunderstood piece of legislation that can protect an entity from the truly "enterprise threatening" liability they could face following a terrorist event. This liability can come from an attack on their own facilities or an attack on a third party where products, technologies, advice or services were provided. The Act's protection can apply to a physical attack on persons or property or to acts of cyber-terrorism that cause physical and/or financial harm. 
The SAFETY Act was enacted by Congress as a part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296). SAFETY Act is actually an acronym for the section of the Homeland Security Act titled the “Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act”. 
The Act’s purpose is to ensure that the threat of potential liability suits does not limit or deter the development, manufacture, deployment, use or commercialization of products, technologies, procedures, software, system integration, advice and/or services that could prevent or mitigate a terrorist attack. 
The Act provides unprecedented immunities, liability protections, caps and other incentives for approved entities who use, supply, design, manufacture, provide or are otherwise involved in preventing, deterring, mitigating, responding to or recovering from a terrorism event. 
SAFETY Act protections apply to a certified act of terrorism when the qualified or "Designated" product, service or technology was used, deployed or otherwise alleged to be involved. The Act's protections can apply to "hard" products as well as to services, procedures, integration of multiple anti-terror tactics, overall facility protection, software, advice, etc. The law applies to products and services provided to, or used by, either the government or civilian sector. 
Protections Automatically Granted Under SAFETY Act.
There are three different “levels” of SAFETY Act protection that can be granted to the applicant - Designation, D T & E and the highest level, "Certification".
Designation.
The designation “label” actually applies to the product or service that the DHS has approved as the qualified anti-terrorism technology or “QATT”. 
Once “designated”, the applicant, now deemed the “seller”, is automatically protected under the applicable SAFETY Act provisions. The seller has the option of listing their product, technology or service under “Designations for Homeland Security” on the SAFETY Act website. 
Benefits provided under SAFETY Act designation include: 
Developmental, Testing & Evaluation Designation or "DTED".
The SAFETY Act provides significant discretion in what may be a Designated QATT. Certain products or services may require additional testing i.e. a prototype with successful lab testing but still requires field testing to validate its safety and efficacy. SAFETY Act protection may be afforded to this product or service but will it include limitations on its use and/or deployment. DT&E Designations remain terminable at-will by the DHS should any concerns on the safety of technology come to light. DT&E Designations will be issued for a reasonable period as needed for testing or evaluating but not longer than 36 months. The Seller has the option of listing their product, technology or service under “D,T & E Designations for Homeland Security” on the SAFETY Act website.
Certification.
Once a product or service is “Designated”, the Seller becomes eligible for “Certification”. The Certification process is separate and distinct from the “Designation” process and requires a more detailed application form and higher level of review by DHS. Once Certified, the product, technology or service is required to be listed as an “Approved Product for Homeland Security” on the SAFETY Act's website.
A Certified party can invoke the “government contractor defense” for covered claims arising out of the designated QATT. The successful assertion of this defense potentially eliminates any and all liability on the part of that Seller. 
Unique to SAFETY Act, once a product, technology or service is Certified, the approved applicant or "Seller" can invoke the Government Contractor Defense regardless if the claim results from sales to the Federal Government or sales entirely between non-governmental entities. 
While the SAFETY Act does not specifically delineate the scope of the GCD, its legislative and precedent history clearly demonstrate its scope is very broad. 
For example, based on case law, it appears clear that under the government contractor defense, a SAFETY Act Certified entity could not be held liable for: 
Design defects, or 
Duty to warn or failure to warn claims, unless the Seller acted fraudulently or with willful misconduct in the SAFETY Act application process or consideration for Certification
Notes.
The Act's protections apply perpetually to all qualified technologies or services provided or deployed during the actual term of Designation except under a DTED where protection only applies during the actual term of the DTED.
SAFETY Act can be deemed to apply to overseas acts of terrorism provided that it causes harm, including financial harm, in the United States
The SAFETY Act’s protections do not apply to any loss that is not the result of a terrorist attack 
The SAFETY Act’s protections do not apply if the technology or service is “Significantly Modified”

Abby Portner

Abigail Portner is a visual artist, designer, music video director and musician in the bands Rings and Hex Message and solo under the name Drawlings. She lives and works in West Hollywood, California.
Visual Art.
Abby Portner's work is closely connected to her friends and especially to her brother David Portner's band Animal Collective. She started to make tour posters when they were still in High School together in Baltimore, Maryland. She later moved to New York City to attend Parsons School for Design, but continued to make record covers and still designs shirts, tour posters and merchandise for the band. For Animal Collective's album, Merriweather Post Pavilion, she contributed a music video for the song "In the Flowers". In the summer of 2010 she built a live set for two Animal Collective shows in Prospect Park in New York City that contained large scale paintings and sculptures of jellyfish, tiki men, moving sharks and shooting water. The work was handmade by Portner in small parts with the help of friends in a working space in Bushwick, New York City, and put together on stage.
Besides drawing for Animal Collective, Portner worked on a wide range of visual art projects, including Tattoo designing and Cartoons. In the end of 2008 she designed skateboards for the Ohio-based brand Alien Workshop. In mid-2010 Portner worked as a guest artist for the animated series "The Velvet Mouse Show".
In early 2010, The Fader Magazine featured Portner in the 65th issue with some artwork and a portrait. In addition, an interview and a slideshow with the artist's work was posted on the magazine's website.
According to herself, the inspiration for her imagery comes from sources like old photos of her childhood, children's magazines and Disney World. She points out the motif of play and playfulness as the main theme of her work. Accordingly, recurrent themes in her drawings are animals, masked children, Christmas and Halloween. In addition to this "childlike" approach Portner adds a dark, melancholic and often eerie undertone to her figures:
Music.
Portner joined Nina Mehta and Kate Rosko of the New York based band "First Nation" in June 2006 as a drummer, shortly after Melissa Livaudis of Telepathe left the band. With Mehta and Rosko she started to write new material as well as playing shows around New York City and at the "Midi Festival" in France in August 2006. After changing the band's name to "Rings", they eventually recorded the full length Black Habit in March 2008 at Rove Studios in Kentucky along with Kristin Anna Valtysdottir who produced the record.
As the drummer of Rings and Among Natives, another musical project of hers, Portner was one of 77 drummers participating in the art project 77 Boadrum in Summer 2007. A year later, she was also part of the follow-up 88 Boadrum. In the meantime, Portner had also joined the four-piece jam band Hex Message. 
In the summer of 2008 Portner started her solo music project Drawlings:
Since then, she played solo shows mostly in New York City and Los Angeles and opened for artists like Animal Collective, Deakin, Kría Brekkan, Foot Village and Angel Deradoorian, with her fellow Rings members joining her sometimes on stage.
In May 2011 Portner will play All Tomorrow's Parties curated by Animal Collective in Minehaed, England, along with Big Boi, Beach House, Atlas Sound, Gang Gang Dance and Paw Tracks bands like Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti and Black Dice.
The only Drawlings release so far is the solo song "Wolfie's Christmas" on a 7-inch named "Be Good to Earth This Season" released on Paw Tracks in the end of 2008.
In an interview in 2010 Portner announced that she plans on recording a Drawlings full-length in the following winter with her brother David Portner to release it on Paw Tracks in early 2011: "[...] I have a name for the record and the album art already realized. I just need to get the songs down."

Frank Llaneza

Frank Llaneza (1920–2010) was a tobacco blender and former executive of Villazon & Co. who is regarded as a pioneer in the resurgence of the premium cigar industry at the end of the 20th Century. Llaneza is best known for the creation and manufacture of a number of popular cigar brands in the years after the 1962 Cuban Embargo, including Hoyo de Monterrey, Punch, Bolivar, and Siglo.
Biography.
Early years.
Frank Llaneza was born on March 9, 1920 in Tampa, Florida. His father, José Llaneza, was a cigar maker who produced a brand in Ybor City known as Pancho Arango. An 11-month long strike of tobacco workers bankrupted many of Tampa's cigar makers, however, including Frank's father. In the aftermath, the elder Llaneza went to work for the company of Schwab-Davis, one of the city's biggest cigar manufacturers as makers of the popular brand Rey del Rey.
During his time as a manager at Schwab-Davis, Frank's father launched another company with his three former business partners called José Arango. When Schwab-Davis was later sold to a company called Gradiaz-Annis, a forerunner of General Cigar Co., the elder Llaneza left the company's employ to devote himself full-time to his own new enterprise.
During his school years, Frank worked part-time in his father's factory, beginning work at age 15. Frank attended and graduated Jesuit High School in Tampa, from which he graduated in 1936.
Early career.
Following graduation from high school, Frank Llaneza went to work in the cigar industry full-time beginning at his father's factory as an apprentice selector of tobacco leaf, helping to sort it for size, color, and quality.
With World War II on the horizon, Llaneza joined the United States Coast Guard in 1940. He served in the Gulf of Mexico and the North Atlantic through the end of the war in 1945.
Following conclusion of the war, Llaneza returned to work in his father's factory as a tobacco selector before moving to become a foreman supervising the torcedores (cigar rollers). Llaneza used the savings he had accumulated to buy a stake in the company, which eventually was held by his father, his brother Joe, and himself. Joe Llaneza ran the Villazon front office and Frank the factory, with the elder Llaneza in charge of picking and packing in the shipping department.
In 1947, Llaneza went to Cuba to learn the leaf trade as an assistant to José Arango's leaf buyer there, José Suarez. Suarez suddenly died during Llaneza's stay, however, leaving the young Frank responsible for buying all the tobacco needed by the factory. It was as a leaf buyer that Frank Llaneza became acquainted with many who would later become giant figures in the cigar industry, including Angel Oliva of Oliva Tobacco Co. and Joe Cullman, father of Joe Cullman III of Philip Morris and Edgar Cullman, the future head of General Cigar Co.
Despite the fact that the American economy underwent a boom in the post-war years, as consumers were suddenly able to buy unlimited quantities of products formerly subjected to wartime rationing, the American cigar industry was hard hit by the sudden release of hundreds of millions of stockpiled cigars onto the market by the United States government. This policy of dumping finished cigars by the government continued into 1948. With cigars easily available at less than their cost of production, once again many small cigar firms based in Tampa were bankrupted, with José Arango among the victims.
Establishment of Villazon & Co..
The José Arango company was reorganized under bankruptcy under a new name, Villazon and Company. Together Frank and his older brother, Joe, began making inexpensive machine-made cigars, carving out a market niche in which they were able to compete with larger firms. Villazon soon acquired a set of trademarks from the Preferred Havana Company, including the brands Flor del Mundo, Bances, and Lord Beaconfield, among others.
Villazon specialized for a time in the manufacture of inexpensive private label cigars for nightclubs in New York City and elsewhere, barely managing to make ends meet on the low profit margins this particular segment of the business allowed. Approximately 45 or 50 people were employed in the company's Tampa factory.
Together with Angel Oliva, Sr., Frank Llaneza was one of the pioneers in the farming of cigar tobacco in Central America. He later recalled:
"Angel Oliva and I took the first Cuban-seed tobaccos to Jalapa in Nicaragua in 1954. By the end of the 1950s, he took some of the tobacco from Nicaragua back to Cuba to some of the farmers there so they could make cigars with it and smoke it just to see the possibilities of tobacco from Nicaragua. It was primitive in Jalapa back in those days. You couldn't get there. There was no road. You had to cross two rivers and there were no bridges. But after that, Mr. Oliva bought farms all over that area and built barns. We were finally able to use that tobacco as we needed it after we ran out of Cuban tobacco. At the time, there wasn't anything that even resembled Cuban tobacco anywhere else in the world."
In 1955, Joe Cullman III, a vice president of tobacco giant Philip Morris, approached the Llaneza brothers and asked them to manufacture Benson & Hedges cigars on behalf of the company, with Frank given approval to select and blend the tobacco used in the brand's products. This proved to be a major turning point in the company's fortunes.
In 1956, Karl Cuesta sold Villazon his cigar making operation and its brands, El Rey del Mundo and Flor de A. Allones, so that Cuesta could concentrate on far more lucrative cigarette manufacturing operations.
Villazon also introduced its own self-named brand in this period. Villazon's production of cigars slowly grew throughout the 1950s, rising from 10,000 or 15,000 cigars a day to about 25,000 a day when the decade drew to a close.
The business shifted somewhat late in the 1950s when Philip Morris decided to exit the cigar business. Excess capacity at Villazon was dedicated to the expansion of the Bances brand, the company's biggest seller.
Villazon continued to purchase Cuban tobacco after the 1959 revolution, only terminating its purchases as the result of an imposition of an American trade embargo established early in 1962.
The embargo years.
An embargo on Cuban products had been correctly anticipated by Angel Oliva, with whom Frank Llaneza worked closely, who managed to export over 2 million pounds of tobacco in the last legal shipment from the island. The private owners of the brand names of the nationalized Cuban cigar industry initially believed that the situation was temporary.
Initially Villazon, with its large stock of available Havana tobacco, was able to license the name Flor de Palacio from its owner, Fernando Palacio, who only later relented by selling the Hoyo de Monterrey, Belinda, and Punch brands to Villazon.
In 1964, with the government of Honduras actively promoting the expansion of the country's tobacco-growing industry, Llaneza established another company called Honduras-American Tobacco S.A. (HATSA). Initially a partnership with a man named Enrique Rivera, Llaneza eventually became the sole owner when Rivera left the business. Beginning with a daily production of between 10,000 and 15,0000 cigars, the company was the first tobacco factory in Danlí, today a major center of the industry.
Due to lower labor costs, difficulty in finding American rollers, and proximity to the raw materials, during the decade of the 1960s Villazon shifted its hand rolled cigar production to Honduras, retaining only a skeleton production facility in Tampa to make special sizes for an elite clientele, such as Red Auerbach of the Boston Celtics and Art Rooney of the Pittsburg Steelers.
With the cigar business in a steady state of decline in the 1970s and 1980s, Villazon purchased facilities which its competitors were abandoning, such as a larger factory space in Tampa, as well as equipment from manufacturers leaving the industry. The company's American operation was thereby expanded, dedicated to making short filler cigars by machine.
Villazon's Honduran handmade cigars were differentiated from the industry, however, as Frank Llaneza recalled in a 1999 interview:
"The majority of the population wanted mild cigars and everybody in the cigar business thought that by producing mild cigars you could start more cigarette smokers to start smoking cigars. That was the logic. But we were making a heavier, fuller-bodied cigar... A lot of people who preferred stronger cigars were still smoking Cuban cigars when they could get them. I think a lot of those smokers, because of the rising prices and because of the deteriorating quality in Cuba, started smoking our cigars. And that is when we started seeing a big jump in the sales."
Sale of Villazon to General Cigar.
Llaneza sold Villazon in 1996, during the height of the cigar boom, to the General Cigar Co. for millions of dollars.
By the end of the 1990s, the Villazon division of General Cigar was making upwards of 125,000 cigars a day, some 32 to 33 million a year, in its manufacturing facilities in Cofradia and Danlí. Many of these were produced for sale via mailorder marketing giant J.R. Tobacco, today a division of Altadis, owned by Imperial Tobacco.
Work with Altadis.
Late in his life, Llaneza returned from semi-retirement to the cigar business, creating new brands and helping to supervise Nicaraguan operations for the cigar making giant Altadis. Among those brands created in this last stage of his career included Siglo and the eponymous Frank Llaneza 1961 brand.
Death and legacy.
Frank Llaneza died March 18, 2010, of heart failure, just two weeks after having celebrated his 90th birthday. Llaneza was survived by his wife, Diane, and four daughters. One of these women, Carol Jean Llaneza, followed in the footsteps of her father and grandfather into the cigar business.
Llaneza was remembered by his peers as one of the supreme figures of the cigar industry. ""He was one of the grandmasters of the industry, like you would consider in chess," John Oliva of the Oliva Tobacco Company recalled at the time of his death.

Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies

The Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, also known as the 2013 Review or just Boundary changes, was the process by which parliamentary constituencies to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom were being reviewed by the four UK Boundary Commissions, to comply with the revised rules for the number and size of constituencies introduced by the Coalition government. The process was intended to be completed by 2015, but following a Commons vote in January 2013 a new review will instead begin in 2015 for completion in 2018. The Boundary Commissions announced the cancellation of the reviews on 31 January 2013.
Following a debate in the House of Lords on 14 January 2013, an amendment to alter the relevant legislation to change the date by which the Sixth Review should be completed was passed with a majority of 69 votes. This was the expected result given opposition on all sides to the legislation. Whilst the Review was required to be completed by October 2013 (by virtue of Section 3 of the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986 as amended by the Part 2 of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011), the amendment to the Parliamentary Constituencies and Voting System Act means it has now been delayed until 2018. 
Background.
The process was launched on 4 March 2011 by the Boundary Commission for England, Boundary Commission for Scotland, Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland and Boundary Commission for Wales. The changes were to be implemented by virtue of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, which amended the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986. Part II of the act (henceforth referred to as 'PVSaCA') deals with the amendments to the manner in which House of Commons constituencies are formed by the individual Boundary Commissions. Each commission was obliged to make a final report to the Secretary of State before 1 October 2013 (by virtue of Section 10, Clause 3, which amends Subsection 2 of Section 3 of the 1986 Act).
The January 2013 vote in the House of Commons effectively killed the process two years after its start by the four national commissions.
Changes to review process.
The legislation made several significant changes to the way constituencies were to be reviewed:
PVSaCA requires there to be exactly 600 parliamentary constituencies (Schedule 2, clause 1) — a reduction of 50 from the total fought at the 2010 General Election. This is the first time a precise number has been included in legislation, and the commissions have no freedom to vary the number.
With a few specified exceptions for island areas (see below), the size (electorate) of all constituencies must be within 5% above or below the target number. Again, there is no leeway given to the commissions.
The first review was to be completed by 2013 so that a general election held in 2015 would have been contested on the new boundaries. The legislation requires a review every five years after that date, rather than every 12 to 15 years previously. To ensure this timetable is achievable, the reviews will take place over the whole country simultaneously, rather than being phased over several years as in the past.
Protected constituencies.
Four island constituencies are 'protected' by PVSaCA. They are;
Timetable.
Each of the four Commissions adopted consistent procedures for developing their boundary proposals, starting with the simultaneous announcements in March 2011 starting the review process.
In each part of the UK, the relevant commission first published "Provisional Proposals", accessible on the Web and viewable at local council offices. There was a 12-week period from the moment of publication during which the public can comment on the proposals, whether supporting, opposing or suggesting an alternative. During this period, public hearings held across the country allowed those representations to be made in public: all written comments received were made public after the end of the 12-week period.
The Commission then considered all representations, and the resulting Revised Recommendations will be published for further public consultation (8 weeks), though without a second public hearing. The Commission will then decide on its final proposals.
The Scottish commission gave the following expected timetable; the timings in the three other countries were expected to be similar. The English commission began its public consultations on 11 October 2011 in Manchester, and concluded on 17/18 November in Darlington, and Exeter.
The four commissions would have been required to present their reports by October 2013. The government had hoped that the reports would then be approved by Parliament and in place for the May 2015 general election. In January 2013, the Government lost a vote on this timetable, which effectively ended the entire process.
Number of seats.
The total of 600 constituencies required by the Act were allocated between the four countries of the UK as shown in the table below. The English Boundary Commission then announced that the number of constituencies allocated to England would be sub-divided by region, with the aim of producing "initial proposals in which each constituency is wholly contained within a single region". The seats allocated to each region are also shown below.
Practical considerations.
The four commissions published descriptions of how they would carry out their work, and held meetings with representatives of political parties to explain their approach in the light of the more restrictive rules to which they have to work.
For example, the Boundary Commission for England stated in its newsletter; "The Commission wishes to make very clear that those with an interest in the review process should understand that the defined number of constituencies and the 5% electoral parity target are statutory requirements that it must apply and that it has absolutely no discretion in respect of either matter."
Size of constituencies.
In Great Britain, constituencies can have no less an electorate than 72,810 and no more than 80,473. The quota in Northern Ireland is slightly different, with a fixed minimum of 70,583 and a fixed maximum of 80,473.
The quota does not apply if the area of a constituency is larger than (new Schedule 2, Rule 4(2)). No constituency can be larger than (new Schedule 2, Rule 4(1)).
Composition of constituencies.
Westminster constituencies are usually created by combining entire electoral wards. For the 2013 Review, the Boundary Commission for England said in its newsletter that whilst it had used entire electoral wards in the past, the new legislation and fixed electorate quota made that harder. Therefore it aimed to use polling districts in circumstances where using entire wards was not possible, and said "it is prepared to take into account as appropriate any new ward boundaries that have been introduced after 6 May 2010". The English Commission outlined that it was "focused on getting all constituencies within the statutory range, rather than as close as possible to the electoral quota figure itself".
The Boundary Commission for Wales, confirming it did not split electoral divisions/wards during the Third, Fourth, or Fifth Periodic Reviews, aimed not to do so again this time. In those circumstances where it would be difficult or impossible to avoid splitting wards, it aimed to use entire Community councils or wards thereof.
The Scottish Commission expected few, if any, existing constituencies to remain unchanged and new seats "probably not" all to be constructed from complete electoral wards. The Northern Ireland Commission expected "few, if any" constituencies to remain the same.
Provisional recommendations.
England.
The Boundary Commission for England released its "Initial Proposals" to the public on 13 September 2011. Across the country, not one single electoral ward was divided.
Amongst the proposals, current Prime Minister David Cameron (Witney) and Leader of the Opposition Ed Miliband (Doncaster North) would have seen their seats remain intact with no changes. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's seat of Sheffield Hallam would have been altered into the proposed "Sheffield West and Penistone".
The Isle of Wight was to be divided into two almost equal halves. The so-called Devonwall constituency, sharing wards between neighbouring Devon and Cornwall, was suggested as "Bideford and Bude".
Scotland.
The Initial Proposal documentation from the Boundary Commission for Scotland was released at midnight on 13 October 2011. Amongst their proposals were six prefixed by the word "Glasgow", a reduction of one across the city. Former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy's seat of Ross, Skye and Lochaber was to be divided between three other seats covering the Highlands, and Argyll and Bute. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown's current seat would also have been redrawn into a newly configured "Kirkcaldy and Glenrothes". Public consultation closed in January 2012.
Northern Ireland.
On 13 September 2011, the Northern Ireland Commission proposed to reduce the number of Belfast seats by one, and create a newly formed "Glenshane", named after the Glenshane Pass. The official response of the Democratic Unionist Party criticised the proposals as having 'the stench of gerrymander' and having 'a disproportionately negative impact upon Unionism'. The Ulster Unionist Party identified 'particular disquiet' in specific towns as a result of the provisional proposals but accepted that there was 'limited room for manoeuvre'.
Wales.
The Boundary Commission for Wales released its provisional recommendations on 11 January 2012. Cardiff had its representation cut by one, the Isle of Anglesey is joined with Bangor and Bethesda in a new seat styled 'Menai ac Ynys Môn', and Merthyr Tydfil is brought into a new constituency named 'Heads of the Valley'. Four electoral wards are divided between constituencies.
Revised recommendations.
There is a statutory eight-week consultation period for responding to revised recommendations, if any are required.
England.
Revised recommendations for the English regions were published on 16 October. Unlike in the initial proposals, the Commission split (or divided) some electoral wards between seats, specifically in Tewkesbury and Gloucester. Additionally, the Isle of Wight was divided east/west and the so-called 'Devonwall' seat was modified to become 'Bideford, Bude and Launceston'.
Scotland.
The Boundary Commission for Scotland released its revised recommendations on 13 September 2012. Of the 50 mainland constituencies initially recommended, 24 went unchanged, thirteen only had new boundaries recommended and five had both boundaries and names changed, whilst eight were just given new names ('Ayr North, Troon and Cumnock', 'Ayrshire Central and Arran', 'Edinburgh South East', 'Galloway, Ayr South and Carrick', 'Glasgow South', 'Inverclyde and Renfrewshire West', 'Renfrewshire South and Ayrshire North', and 'West Dunbartonshire and Bearsden North').
Northern Ireland.
On 16 October 2012, the Northern Irish Commission confirmed alterations to their proposed Antrim, Fermanagh and Tyrone seats.
Wales.
Revised recommendations for Wales were published on 24 October. Almost all the initial proposals were altered, so as to place Machynlleth in a 'Brecon, Radnor and Montgomery' seat, and to rename proposed constituencies across North Wales as 'Ynys Môn a Bangor', 'Conwy and Colwyn', and 'Flint and North Denbighshire'.
Political and economic impact and controversy.
The review was not without controversy. A spokesperson for the opposition Labour Party told the BBC "political motives" were behind the changes when they were introduced. Labour's former Shadow Scottish Secretary, Ann McKechin, called the process "gerrymandering". whilst her successor Margaret Curran criticised "Nick Clegg's plan to gerrymander Scotland". Former Conservative Minister Sir Malcolm Rifkind labelled the proposals "a muddle". Labour MP for Preston, Mark Hendrick, labelled the proposals "gerrymandering to curry political persuasion".
In June 2011, research company Democratic Audit published findings into review of potential constituency changes. The organisation attempted to create a set of boundaries for the UK according to the new rules, and examine their political consequences. Their studies suggested the Liberal Democrats could lose "a quarter" of their current seats. Provisional notional results published in January 2012 calculated the Conservatives could have won 299 seats under the new boundaries.
In August 2012 the House of Lords Reform Bill 2012 was dropped by the Government following disagreements between members of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties. In response, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg confirmed that he would instruct his members of parliament to vote against the Sixth Periodic Review, although David Cameron has vowed to pass the necessary orders regardless. On 30 October, a proposed amendment to the Electoral Registration and Administration Bill was tabled by Labour and Liberal Democrat peers which would postpone the Sixth Periodic Review until 2018. 
On 31 October 2012, Labour peer Lord Hart, crossbench peer Lord Kerr, Liberal Democrat peer Lord Rennard, and former Plaid Cymru leader Lord Wigley tabled an amendment to the Electoral Registration and Administration Bill going through Parliament, which would postpone the Sixth Review until 2018. During the 14 January debate, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg received personal criticism of the position Lords found themselves in: former Scottish Secretary Lord Forsyth accused Clegg of "going from 'cross' to 'double cross'"
In October 2012, Lord Wallace told the House of Lords that the Boundary Commissions had spent £5.8million as of August 2012 and would spend a further £3.8million from September 2012 until the end of the Review.
Termination of review.
On 31 January 2013 the four boundary commissions issued statements announcing that they would not be continuing with the review. The English Boundary Commission officially closed their portion of the Sixth Periodic Review. The Boundary Commission for Scotland closed its part of the review confirming they would not be completing it. The Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland also announced they had ended the review and would not be reporting to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. The Boundary Commission for Wales stated they were cancelling the review, and would not finalise the development of their recommendations.

Knife collecting

Knife collecting is a hobby which includes seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining knives. Some collectors are generalists, accumulating an assortment of different knives. Others focus on a specialized area of interest, perhaps bayonets, knives from a particular factory, Bowie knives, pocketknives, or handmade custom knives. 
The knives of collectors may be antiques or even marketed as collectible. Antiques are knives at least 100 years old; collectible knives are of a later vintage than antique, and may even be new. Collectors and dealers may use the word "vintage" to describe older collectibles. Some knives which were once everyday objects may now be collectible since almost all those once produced have been destroyed or discarded, like certain WW2 era knives made with zinc alloy handles which are rapidly degrading due to the material's shelf life. Some collectors collect only in childhood while others continue to do so throughout their lives and usually modify their collecting goals later in life.
History.
Knives have been collected by individuals since the 19th century with formal collecting organizations beginning in the 1940s. The custom knife-collecting boom began in the late 1960s and continues to the present.
Beginning a collection.
Some novice knife collectors start by purchasing knives that appeal to them, and then slowly work at acquiring knowledge about how to build a collection. Others (more cautious or studious types) want to develop some background in the field before starting to buy knives. 
In general, knives of significance, artistic beauty, values or interest that are "too young" to be considered antiques, fall into the realm of collectibles. But not all collectibles are limited editions, and many of them have been around for decades. 
Many knife collectors enjoy making a plan for their collections, combining education and experimentation to develop a personal collecting style; and even those who reject the notion of "planned collecting" can refine their "selection skills" with some background information on the methods of collecting.
Strategies.
Knife magazines such as "Knives Illustrated" and "Blade" are one of the most popular means to learn more about the field. Attending knife shows, gun shows, and militaria shows is another way for a collector to familiarize him or herself with the hobby. These shows sometimes include seminars on a variety of subjects such as knife making seminars, the history of knife companies, starting a collection or how to insure a collection. There are a number of books dedicated to collecting knives.
Although national and international collector clubs exist such as the National Knife Collectors Association. A collector may find and join a local knife club to meet other people who collect knives. Knife publications frequently list the location, date and time of club meetings as a service to new collectors. Collectors who have already narrowed their collecting focus to the knives of a particular maker or factory may want to join a club that focuses on this producer's work: such as the Randall Knife Society, Emerson's Collector Club, etc.
Types of collections.
Knife collections are varied and run the gamut from collections of $5US pocketknives to $100,000US Art knives.
Collecting antique Bowie knives is one of the higher-end forms of knife collecting with rare models selling for more than $200,000. Even mass-produced Sheffield Bowies from the 19th century can sell in the range of $5,000US to $15,000US.
The internet.
A potential collector may wish to chat with other knife collectors in specialized discussion forums via the Internet. Fellow knife collectors are usually very happy to share information with new collectors; this includes information about where they have been successful in acquiring their knives, where they have struggled and what they are looking for. Internet Knife forums allow for an open exchange of information, sometimes with experts and makers available to answer questions and offer guidance. In addition, several web-sites specializing exclusively in the selling and trading of knives have been launched in recent years to help collectors manage their items as well as compare, connect, and trade directly with others.
Knife discussion forums.
There are a number of usenet and Internet forums dedicated to the discussion of knives and knife collecting. The oldest of such forums is rec.knives, a usenet group started in 1992. The largest is BladeForums.com with over 100,000 members which primarily emphasizes production knives. Manufacturers such as Cold Steel, Spyderco, and Benchmade have established their own forums giving them input from users and a method of responding to customer service issues in a timely fashion. Some forums such as Usual Suspects Network have gone so far as to host their own knife shows on a scale similar to "Blade" magazine's annual Blade Show.
Secondary market.
The retail price of a knife is valid only at the moment it was purchased. Once the knife comes into the buyer’s possession, its value is linked to what is called the secondary market. Once a knife is purchased, most of the costs associated with the retail price (i.e. advertising, production cost, shipping cost, etc.) must be deducted from the retail cost to determine the object’s immediate value on the secondary market, thus, retail cost is not equivalent to secondary market resale value. Depending on several different factors, individuals, auctioneers, and secondary retailers may sell a knife for more, the same, or less than what they originally paid for it. These factors include, but are not limited to, condition, age, supply, and demand.
The 1960s through the present were major years for the manufacturing of contemporary collectible knives. While some individuals purchased these knives to enjoy and use, many purchased them as investments. A speculative secondary markets developed for many knives in the 1990s. Because so many people bought for investment purposes, duplicates are common. And although many knives were labeled as "limited editions," the actual number of items produced was very large. The result of this is that there is very little demand for many (but not all) items produced during this time period, which means their secondary market values are often low.
There is no secondary market for a knife unless someone is willing to buy it, and a knife's value is whatever the buyer is willing to pay for it. Industry leaders believe that the secondary market is important for several reasons: primarily to allow experienced collectors to upgrade their collections, to stimulate the market and encourage new collectors, and to provide a means for monetary appreciation. To upgrade a collection, a collector may wish to dispose of knives they no longer enjoy to produce the capital to buy other knives. To stimulate the market, collectors may obtain some good quality pieces that have been traded in the past. They have an opportunity to learn the history of the hobby by owning some of the knives that have been favorites in the past. Another reason is to make money, by selling an item with appreciated value.
Some custom knife makers have large followings of collectors. Because demand far outweighs the supply, it is not uncommon for these knives to appreciate substantially within seconds of buying them from the maker. The secondary market can range anywhere from 50% to 200% of the knife's original value. 
A price guide is a resource such as a book or website that lists typical selling prices. Most knife publications offer annual price guides to give collectors an idea of what their knives may be worth.

Yéle Haiti

Yéle Haiti was a charitable organization found by Wyclef Jean, Jerry Duplessis and Hugh Locke in January 2005, in the wake of Hurricane Jeanne which devastated the island. The organization seeks change in Haiti through programs in education, sports, the arts and the environment.
In its first year of operation, the foundation, with funding by Comcel, provided scholarships to 3,600 children in Gonaïves, Haiti. The organization expanded by adding community service programs including food distribution and mobilization of emergency relief. The organization quickly became known for focusing global attention on Haiti.
In May 2008, Yéle partnered with the World Food Programme of the United Nations to launch www.togetherforhaiti.org. In September of that year, Yéle expanded beyond Haiti's borders delivering food to Hurricane Ike victims in the United States.
In 2009, Yéle and the Timberland Company joined forces to help raise environmental awareness in Haiti. Their campaign was created to push to support and educate the country as well as helping to improve health care and the environment, and the community.
Yéle Haiti was profoundly and permanently changed by the earthquake of January 12, 2010. The current programs are a combination of emergency relief and long-term rebuilding.
Yéle Haiti: Developing Education in Haiti.
Since its establishment in 2005, Yéle Haiti has been committed to making a difference within realistic constraints in terms of delivering aid and assistance to those in greatest need.
Yéle Haiti has identified youth development and education (schooling and youth services) as one of three principal areas to concentrate their resources and efforts on. Their commitment on this area has led to the creation of a substantial number of signature initiatives and collaborations with significant partners.
Present Projects
1. Since 2005, it has been providing scholarships for 4,500 children annually. These children come from needy families in Port-au-Prince, Gonaives, Cap-Haitien, Port-de-Paix and Cayes who are unable to afford the fees for primary education.
2. Since 2008, 12 elite students majoring in different fields have been sponsored scholarships to attend four of the top universities in Haiti.
3. The Help Haiti campaign was launched in 2005, where seven schools in Alberta, Canada helped raised funds to put 20 children in schools in Haiti. The 2008 campaign raised sufficient funds to put 345 children in school for one year and the figures rose in 2009 to 370.
4. This ongoing project also sponsors the transformation of children’s jail into a rehabilitation center with programs to help develop skill for the boys, by providing them with educational and vocational training in order to help them escape the cycle of crime and violence.
5. The Youth Sports Program ongoing since 2005; boosts a soccer and tutoring program for 650 deprived children. In addition to their educations being paid for, they undergo soccer training and have full access to equipments and clinics with a well nutritional supplement program.
6. Yéle Corps, a joint venture between Yéle Haiti and the Hope for Haiti Now Fund, together with BET’s Saving OurSelves Program, is a job training and employment program, one of the first of such initiatives. Since the program began, approximately 2000 people have been employed to remove rubble and debris piled up after the earthquake.
Future Projects
With focus on developing education for future generations in Haiti and turning the tide on the brain drain in the past decades, Yéle Haiti is planning new initiatives:
1. There are plans to build more computer labs with more equipped with internet connection over the next year. Each will have a minimum of 25 computers and support equipment that includes a generator, inverter and a dish for internet connection.
2. A new K-12 educational campus named the Yéle Campus School (YCS) will be built to offer top-notch education stressing academic, artistic and vocational training.
3.Next fall, Yéle Haiti will name 10 underprivileged students to be sent to American for an all expenses-paid scholarship. In return, the program will require participants to return to Haiti for at least two years upon graduation from college.
Tent Camp Improvements.
It’s not a house and it’s not a tent, but somewhere in between. The two SoftHouse structures installed in the Yéle-supported Place Fierte Tent Camp in Cité Soleil in February 2011 have a poured concrete foundation, a structural steel frame covered by high-strength mesh fabric, and a full-size door that opens on hinges. Yéle is partnering with the Haiti SoftHouse Group to build an initial 20 units as part of our upgrade of the Place Fierte Tent Camp.The SoftHouses are very spacious inside with and no interior supports. The outer walls start at and the roof goes up to in the center. Cross ventilation is excellent because of screen panels that can be covered during rain and at night. If necessary, the whole unit can be taken down by hand and moved in a matter of hours. And given the location, it is important to note that the SoftHouses are engineered to resist both category 3 hurricanes and earthquakes.There is no single solution to the housing needs of the more than one million people still living in tents, but what is clear is that tent camps are going to be around for a considerable time. The SoftHouse is put forward as one option that bridges the gap between tent and permanent home, and which is flexible enough to be used afterwards for commercial or other secondary needs.
Jean et Marie Orphanage.
Yéle is providing ongoing support for the 55 children and nine staff members at the Jean et Marie Orphanage in La Plaine, near Port-au-Prince. The meager facilities at Jean et Marie were damaged in the earthquake. Yéle is now helping with additional repairs and improvements including adding a school and kitchen, expanded dormitory space, and improving the latrines and showers. Yéle currently supplies water, food, clothing and other supplies on a regular basis to Jean et Marie, and has begun to help the orphanage’s management upgrade their administrative practices to better serve the resident orphans.
Nutrition for Kids.
Yéle announced plans in November 2010 to double the size of their Nutrition for Kids program, and in February 2011 reached that goal, providing 2,000 orphans a week with fresh vegetables grown by peasant farmers who are part of the Afè Nèg Combite (ANC) cooperative based in Kenscoff, near Port-au-Prince. There are now 35 orphanages in the program, and they receive a basket with between 150 and 200 lbs. of vegetables every Saturday (some larger orphanages get more than one basket). The orphanages are located in Port-au-Prince, Kenscoff, Croix-des-Bouquets, Leogane and Tomazeau and range in size from 40 to 200 children.
Tree Planting.
Yéle Vert is a multi-year program in which farmers operate tree nurseries that supply multi-purpose and fast-growing trees for food, animal fodder, building material and fuel. Each nursery also provides an agricultural service that supplies seeds, tools and training to help farmers improve their crop production and integrate tree planting into their farming practices. 
In the communities served by Yéle Vert, an environmental education initiative helps children and youth in the area learn about the role of trees and how they should be protected. Popular musicians are enlisted to take this message to the general public. Yéle Vert was conceived prior to the January 12th earthquake, and was launched in the Gonaïves area in February 2010 with the establishment of six nurseries. Those nurseries produced the first 100,000 trees in June 2010, and by the end of the year an additional 375,000 trees will be transplanted by farmers to their fields and community owned land. Beginning in January 2011, the annual capacity of the Gonaïves site of Yéle Vert will be 1 million trees a year.
Yéle's mission is to provide aid and assistance to the communities in Haiti in greatest need, where severe poverty, widespread unemployment, rampant malnutrition and crippling illiteracy are most pervasive. In doing so, we strive to balance emergency relief with support for long term sustainable initiatives that together are giving both hope and practical assistance to the people of Haiti.
Financial Issues.
The Foundation filed its tax forms for 2005–2007 all in August 2009, a delay Charity Navigator characterized as "odd" even among charities, and "beyond late". Much of Yéle Haiti's money has been paid out to Wyclef Jean, his relative and fellow Yéle Haiti director Jerry Duplessis, or companies they own. For example, of the $1,142,944 in total revenue the foundation collected in 2006, at least $410,000 was paid directly to Jean and his business partner for rent, production services, and Jean's appearance at a benefit concert. The Foundation paid $250,000 to Telemax, a television station controlled by Jean and Duplessis, $31,000 to rent its own offices from Platinum Sound owned by Jean and Duplessis, and $100,000 for Jean's own performance at a benefit concert in Monaco, when Jean had been paid only $40,000 as headliner at 2002 festival at the top of his career with the Fugees.
Hugh Locke, president of Yéle Haiti, said "I think people should be very comfortable that any money given to Yéle Haiti is going 100 percent to emergency relief." and that the group hopes to increase the percentage of its budget on services as it gains experience. He described the concert payments as "not our finest hour". A spokesman for Yéle Haiti's public relations firm described paying Jean's and Duplessis' companies as an opportunity to receive services at a "severely reduced" rate and a "significant discount". Yéle Haiti, and its predecessor the Wyclef Jean Foundation, have been involuntarily dissolved several times by the Florida Division of Corporations on multiple occasions for failing to file required state disclosure reports. The long overdue records from several years were submitted to the FDC and the sanctions were lifted after a month.

Orla Railway

The Orla Railway () is a 14.9 kilometre long branch line in Thuringia, that runs from Orlamünde on the Saal Railway to Pößneck's "lower station" ("unterer Bahnhof"). Until 1946 there was a continuation of the line to Oppurg on the Leipzig–Gera–Saalfeld railway.
The 11.7 km long line, that branches off in Orlamünde from the Saal Railway south of Jena and is only operated today as far as the lower station in Pößneck, was inaugurated on 1 October 1889 to this station.
A second section of line followed, from Pößneck lower station to Oppurg, which was opened in 1892 and closed again in 1946, because that section went after the war to the then Soviet Union as a war reparation.
The section remaining today underwent a full renovation ("Grundsanierung") in 1999/2000. In the years that followed an hourly service was introduced on this line and, since the 2001 timetable change, the services connect to Jena Saal station ("Jena Saalbahnhof").

Glasgow International Exhibition (1901)

The Glasgow International Exhibition was the second of 4 international exhibitions held in Glasgow, Scotland during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Summary.
The exhibition followed the lead of the previous Glaswegian exhibition in 1888 and took place at Kelvingrove Park. It ran between 2 May and 4 November and was opened by the Duchess of Fife.
It marked the opening of the city's Art Gallery and also commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the first world's fair held in the UK doubled its attendance with 11.5 million visits.
Exhibits.
Following the style popularised at the 1893 Chicago and 1901 Buffalo world's fairs the main exhibition building was in Renaissance-Baroque style. But the large industrial hall contrasted strongly having a large white facade with Spanish, Turkish and Venetian ornamentation and a large golden dome atop. This design by Scottish architect James Miller won him one of his many awards.
Countries with close ties to Glasgow exhibited including Japan, Canada and Russia. The Russian exhibition was the largest, a 'Russian village' of 4 pavilions reported to have cost the Tsar of Russia £30 000 and included several brightly coloured buildings designed by Fyodor Schechtel.
Whilst Charles Mackintosh's designs for the major exhibition halls were rejected, he did design four pavilions for commercial organisations, and one for the Glasgow School of Art.
Many art works were displayed, including "Danae" by Edward Burne-Jones, a plaster version of Rodin's "Burghers of Calais" and 160 works loaned by William Burrell.
Entertainments included a switchback railway, a water chute, an Indian theatre and soap sculptures.
Legacy.
The land used is now a park, the 40 foot cast-iron Walter MacFarlane Saracen Fountain from the Saracen Foundry now resides in Alexandra Park and two cottages from Port Sunlight still exist.
Notables.
The exhibition took place during a period of half-mourning requested by Edward VII but was still popular and made more than £35000 profit.
Visitors.
As well as the opening by the Duchess of Fife, the fair was also visited by the King of Siam and by Empress Eugenie (travelling incognito).

Survivor Greece 2

Survivor 2, was the second edition of the Greek version of the popular reality show Survivor and it aired from September 2004 to December 2004. There were a few main twists this season, the first being that the tribes were initially divided by gender. However, this twist was short lived due to the evacuation of Helen and Maria's voluntary exit both which took place in week two of the shows airing. The other twist for this season was that of "Gkoal", when a contestant was voted out they would be given a chance to go to Gkoal where they would duel other contestants for a spot in the game. The winner of Gkoal was Manolis. Right before the merge, the contestants took part in a challenge which Giannis lost and was eliminated. When it came time for the final four, all remaining contestants were asked to vote for someone to return to the game from the eliminated contestants, Konstantina who had been voted out right after the elimination challenge that took place before the merge, received the most votes and returned to the game. When given the opportunity to vote for a winner only three jury members chose to vote as the others didn't feel either of the final two deserved to win the season. Ultimately, it was Konstantina Golias won this season over Anna Majuro with a jury vote of 3-0.

He has also directed videos for "The Next Star", a series aired on the youth-oriented Canadian television network YTV. Poliquin has also appeared on MuchMusic's television program New.Music.Live as an industry expert.
Early life, education.
John "JP" Poliquin was born on August 24, 1986 in North Vancouver, British Columbia. In his youth he would use his father's video camera to shoot "crazy short films and skateboard videos." As a high school student he attended Handsworth Secondary School in Vancouver, and during the summers would work on local film sets. Around 2005 this included working as a production assistant on projects such as "Merlin's Apprentice", "John Tucker Must Die", and "Snakes on a Plane", and by 2006 he was also working on sets such as "Her Fatal Flaw" as a camera trainee. In 2009 he served as a grip in "Santa Buddies" and a location production assistant for the TV movie "Web of Desire". Stated Poliquin, "I worked in tons of different departments (assistant directing, camera, grip, props, locations, etc.) and realized that what I really wanted to do was direct. Even if it was low budget I knew I'd enjoy that role more." He graduated with a BFA in New Media and Film from the University of Lethbridge in Alberta.
Film career.
Early years.
Among Poliquin's first directorial projects was the short film "Inside Charlie," released in 2007. The film, which he co-wrote, followed the story of a photographer seeking to take a picture to save his career. At the 2008 Calgary International Film Festival it was nominated for both "Best New Film" and "Audience Favorite."
Music videos.
By 2010 Poliquin was active in directing music videos for artists, many signed to major labels in Canada. Among the bands he has worked with are Hey Ocean!, Tim Chaisson, Hedley, Finger Eleven, My Darkest Days, Mother Mother, Arkells, Theory of a Deadman, The Trews, Small Sins, The New Cities, Paper Lions, illScarlett, The Latency, Brock Zanrosso, Victoria Duffield, State of Shock, and Gary Beals. Poliquin was nominated for his first major music video award in 2010, when "A Song About California" by Hey Ocean! was nominated for "Best New Video" at the Leo Awards. His music video work has since been nominated for awards at the Juno Awards, the MuchMusic Video Awards, the East Coast Music Association Awards, and the PEI Music Awards.
In 2010, Tim Chaisson's band filmed their first music video for “Broken Hearted Beat” in Toronto with Poliquin. The video was released in May 2010 on CMT and also made it to the #1 spot on Much More Music’s Top 10. Immediately following the video’s release, its single was released and made it to #1 on the East Coast Countdown. The music video for “Slippin’ Away”, also directed by Poliquin, was released in October 2010. It reached #8 on the Much More Music Top 20 Countdown. Also in 2010, the band Paper Lions had the Poliquin-directed video for their single "Lost the War" nominated for a 2010 CBC Radio 3 Bucky Award.
John JP Poliquin has appeared on-air several times on MuchMusic's television program New.Music.Live, sitting on an expert panel to discuss industry music videos and adding entries to their official blog. In January 2012, his music video for Light Organ Records artist Adaline "The Noise" premiered exclusively with Andy Warhol's "Interview Magazine".
Film and television.
From 2010 to 2012 he directed segments for "The Next Star", a series aired on the youth-oriented Canadian television network YTV.
In 2012, Poliquin directed the found-footage horror film "Grave Encounters 2", the sequel to the 2011 cult hit "Grave Encounters", which is his first film as director. Written and produced by the Canadian filmmaker duo The Vicious Brothers, the film follows a film student investigating the found footage from the sequel. The film received mixed reviews, but like it's predecessor, many were largely positive, particularly concerning Poliquin's directorship. According to Dread Central, "if you look at just the first two acts, it is one of the most smartly written... and directed movies this reviewer has seen all year. At the helm is John Poliquin, and he takes the events of the first film and builds upon them in the most clever of ways. Poliquin's direction is beyond spot on, and he and the Vicious Brothers collectively managed to deliver an almost perfect sequel to "Grave Encounters"."
Style and themes.
About his influences, Poliquin has stated his favorite directors include David Fincher, Michel Gondry, Jonas Akerlund, and Dougal Wilson, and that "For horror films, Hitchcock and Kubrick are my idols."
Personal life.
He currently resides in New York City.

<doc id="31081627" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31081627" title="Invasion of Dumatul Jandal">
Invasion of Dumatul Jandal

The Invasion of Dumatul Jandal, took place in Rabi‘ Al-Awwal, 5 A.H i.e. in June, 626 AD, or July 626 AD.
According to the Sealed Nectar, Dumat Al-Jandal is located at about a distance of fifteen days march from Madinah and five from Damascus. According to William Montgomery Watt, it is 500 miles from Medina.
Invasion.
According to William Muir, due to a famine in the area, some tribes were attacking travellers and threatened to raid Medina.
According to The Sealed Nectar, after a six-month lull of military activities, Muhammad received intelligence that some tribes, in the vicinity of Dumat Al-Jandal, on the borders of Syria, were involved in highway robbery and plundering, and were on their way to muster troops and raid Madinah itself. He immediately appointed Siba‘ bin ‘Arfatah Al-Ghifari to dispose the affairs of Madinah during his absence, and set out at the head of 1000 Muslims, a man named Madhkur, from Bani ‘Udhrah, was his guide.
On their way to Dumat Al-Jandal, they used to march by night and hide by day, so that they might take the enemy by surprise. When they drew near their destination, the Muslims discovered that the highway men had moved to another place, so they captured their cattle and shepherds. Muhammad stayed there for 5 days during which he dispatched expeditionary forces to hunt for the enemy personnel but they detected none. He made a treaty with ‘Uyainah bin Hisn while returning to Madinah.
William Muir states that the "robbers fled without offering any opposition".
Analysis.
William Montgomery Watt claims that this was the most significant expedition Muhammad ordered at the time, even though it received little notice in the primary sources. Duma was 500 miles from Medina, and Watt says that there was no immediate threat to Muhammad, other than the possibility that his communications to Syria and supplies to Medina being interrupted. Watt says "It is tempting to suppose that Muhammad was already envisaging something of the expansion which took place after his death", and that the rapid march of his troops must have "impressed all those who heard of it".
William Muir also believes that the expedition was important as Muhammad followed by 1000 men reached the confines of Syria, where distant tribes had now learnt to fear his name, while the political horizon of Muhammad was extended. He also claims that the lust of the Muslim's to plunder was extended to a far wider range.

On Wednesday, 23 February, he told the Toronto Star he resigned as counselor because the embassy's chargé d'affaires was "hiding" the gravity of the deadly crackdown back home. "It is my friends who are dying!," he said.
Al-Mismari's decision was due to his embassy's effort aimed at hiding and downplaying the brutal attacks against protesters in his homeland. He was quoted as saying, "They are killing the friends with whom I grew up; they are killing my brothers and sisters."

Alexander MacDonald Shook

Major Alexander MacDonald Shook was a Canadian World War I flying ace. During his stint with the Royal Naval Air Service, he was credited with 12 official aerial victories.
Early life.
Shook was born in Ontario, Canada on 2 December 1888; the exact town is given as either Erindale or Tioga. He joined the Royal Naval Air Service. At 28 years of age when he reported for duty, he was somewhat older than the majority of his fellow pilots.
World War I.
On 15 November 1915, Shook was awarded Aviator's Certificate number 2056 at the completion of his pilot's training on a Curtiss biplane earned at their school in Toronto. He first flew Sopwith two-seater airplanes for No. 5 Naval Wing after his training. "A" Squadron of 5 Wing became No. 4 Squadron RNAS in December 1916, being equipped with Sopwith 1 1/2 Strutters and Sopwith Pups. Shook was transferred to 4 Naval as a founding member and Flight Commander. Flying one of their Pups, serial numbered N6200 but dubbed "Bobs", he scored his first aerial victory during Bloody April, 1917, driving an Albatros D.II down out of control on the 24th. On 9 May, he would use the same Pup to share a victory over a German reconnaissance plane; Langley Frank Willard Smith was the other victorious pilot. Three days later, Shook scored his third and last win in "Bobs", downing a seaplane offshore of Zeebrugge. He then upgraded to a Sopwith Camel.
On 5 June 1917, Shook became the first pilot from Naval 4 to score a victory in one of the new Camels; he destroyed a German Albatros D.III and drove down a two-seater reconnaissance plane above Ostend to become an ace. A month later, on 4 July, he was credited with destroying a Gotha G bomber although the German records do not acknowledge the loss. His efforts earned him a "Croix de guerre" from a grateful French government on 20 July 1917.
He was also awarded the Distinguished Service Cross on 11 August 1917; the accompanying citation read:
""For exceptional gallantry and remarkable skill and courage whilst serving with the R.N.A.S. at Dunkirk during May and June, 1917, in repeatedly attacking and destroying hostile aircraft.""
On 18 August 1917, he was credited with a win over an Albatros D.V. He would score once more in 1917, being credited with victory over an Albatros D.III on 21 October, he was wounded in action during this dogfight. He would not return to action until January 1918.
On 1 January 1918, King George V appointed Shook as a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order ""in recognition of...services in the prosecution of the war.""
In March 1918, Shook resumed his winning ways. On the 11th, he was credited with an Albatros D.V; on the 22nd, he downed three more over Slype, including German ace Bertram Heinrich. This ended his victory tally; it included seven enemy airplanes destroyed and five driven down out of control.
Shook added an Air Force Cross to his awards after the RNAS was subsumed into the new Royal Air Force on 1 April 1918. Shook emerged from the war as a major.
Post World War I.
Shook died in Bala, Canada on 30 May 1966.

Viking Warrior

Viking Warrior is a young adult historical novel written by Judson Roberts in 2006. It is the first book of Judson's Strongbow Saga, set in the Viking Age. It was first published in 2006. The author is a descendant of Rollo (also known as Rolf or Hrolf), a Viking who, in 911 AD, signed a treaty and received grants to the land which became Normandy.
Plot summary.
At the beginning of the novel, the reader is introduced to Halfdan, who is cutting wood and squaring timber. Halfdan is a slave, despite being the son of an Irish princess, and a great chieftain. Derdriu (his mother) arrives to watch her son work and to look out at the bay near their estate. Not too soon, Gunhild arrives to send Derdriu back to her chores, for she is a slave, too. As soon as she has finished speaking, a longship enters the bay, carrying Hrorik, who has been in England raiding. The reader soon discovers that their raid has been met with failure, and many died or are wounded. Harald is unharmed, but Hrorik is on the verge of death. Quickly, Harald recounts the lengthy story of their raid, and how Hrorik was injured. Soon after, he, Sigrid, Derdriu, and Halfdan gather around Hrorik as he is dying. With one of his final breaths, he asks Derdriu to accompany him to Valhalla (the hall of warriors) which is an honor in the society described. To do this, she must die with him. She agrees, only if Halfdan is freed from enslavement, and is acknowledged as Hrorik’s son. Hrorik agrees, and soon he is dead.
Hrorik and Derdriu are laid in the death ship, upon which dead warriors are sent off to Valhalla, and burned to ash. That night, Harald is made the chieftain of the estate, and Halfdan is officially freed, so he dines with the carls of the household, like a normal free man. He wakes up the following morning, hungover from the previous night's festivities, and Harald begins Hafldan’s training into becoming a warrior. He discovers quickly that Halfdan has a knack for fighting, and begins training with him day and night for months. The two of them go hunting one day, since Halfdan has a great talent with the bow, and Halfdan makes an amazing shot, showing off his skill. That night, Sigrid and Gunhild prepare a feast. Their feast is interrupted though.
Toke arrives, after hearing of Hrorik’s death. Toke comes to claim his inheritance (he has received none) and the reader infers that Toke is a disturbed, a war-crazed man. The reader learns of Toke's backstory: it is this attitude of rage that led Hrorik to kick Toke out of the estate where he had been living. While Gunhild informs Toke that he received no inheritance, Harald reveals to Halfdan that Hrorik left him an estate called Limfjord, which Hrorik used to rule. Toke is furious that a former slave gets an estate while he himself gets nothing, and demands that they give him something in return. Harald denies Toke, but lets him stay for the night and enjoy in their feast. During the feast, a fight almost breaks out, but Harald quells it, and ejects Toke, like Hrorik had done long ago. Toke leaves the following morning, and soon Halfdan and Harald, among other carls, set out for Limfjord, the newly-inherited estate.
While at Limfjord, Halfdan meets Abbot Aidan, who used to be one of his mother’s friends. Soon after arriving, a band of raiders attack their estate. They are trapped inside the longhouse and attempt to get the slaves, women, and children out. The leader of the raiders seems to heed this request, but as soon as they leave the house, he has them killed. Harald and Halfdan decide that they need to escape, so they hide in between two oxen and leave. Their escape doesn’t last long, however, because the raiders kill the oxen, and leave Halfdan, Harald, and the other carls exposed. In the following battle, Halfdan manages to escape without injury, at the cost of Harald’s death. Halfdan escapes to a forest, where he is being hunted by raiders. At this point he learns that the raiders were Toke and his crew. He manages to stay one step ahead of Toke’s men, and swears an oath to kill every man of Toke’s crew. He kills the two men following him, and heads to the town Hedeby where he begins his journey of revenge.
Reception.
"Kliatt" complimented the book as being "filled with enough war and suspense, emotion, Viking savagery and honor to keep the reader motivated."

Captain Adrian James Boswell Tonks was a British World War I flying ace. He was credited with 12 official aerial victories, and won a Distinguished Flying Cross for his successes. He also won a second DFC for his valor in pressing home bombing assaults on the enemy.
World War I.
On 13 August 1916, Tonks was appointed a probationary Flight Sub-Lieutenant.
Tonks was posted to 4 Naval Squadron as a Sopwith Camel pilot. He scored his first aerial victories on 22 August 1917, when he sent down two German Albatros D.V fighter planes out of control southeast of Ostend. On 9 November, it was a DFW reconnaissance two-seater that he put down out of control north of Pervijze, Belgium. On 23 November 1917, he scored another "out of control" victory east of Keiem, over another Albatros D.V.
Tonks would be promoted from Flight Sub-Lieutenant to Flight Lieutenant on 1 January 1918. He resumed scoring on 30 June 1918, driving down a Fokker D.VII out of control over Zeebrugge. On both 10 and 13 August, he drove down another Fokker D.VII. On 15 August, he sent down three Fokker D.VIIs out of control east of Ypres. On 28 September 1918, he destroyed a Fokker D.VII over Werken, and sent another down out of control. He then turned to bombing missions.
Tonks won two Distinguished Flying Crosses in quick succession. The first one, awarded 2 November 1918, was granted for his valor in aerial combat. Its accompanying citation read:
""A brave and determined airman who has destroyed four enemy aeroplanes and driven down six out of control. In a recent engagement with twelve enemy scouts he destroyed one and drove off others who were attacking some pilots in his flight. In these combats he expended all his ammunition, but seeing three enemy machines attacking one of ours, he, with great gallantry, dived amongst them with a view to distracting their attention...""
He received the Bar to the Distinguished Flying Cross in lieu of a second award on 3 December 1918. As its text related:
""Since 28 September this officer has led eleven low bombing raids, displaying conspicuous courage and skill, and inflicting serious damage on enemy from low altitudes. During bombing raids Captain Tonks has destroyed two enemy machines, proving himself a bold and daring fighter."" 
Post World War I.
On 3 January 1919, Tonks was confirmed in his rank as captain. He died and was buried in plot B.158 in Alexandria's Hadra War Memorial Cemetery, Egypt.

Elster Valley Railway

The Elster Valley Railway () is a main railway line in the German federal states of Thuringia and Saxony that runs along the valley of the White Elster from Gera via Greiz and Plauen to Weischlitz.
History.
The construction of the line goes back to the section from Gera Hbf–Wolfsgefärth on the Gera–Saalfeld railway. The section from Wolfsgefärth to Greiz went into service on 17 July 1875. The second section was that from Greiz to Plauen Lower Station ('"unterer Bahnhof") which opened on 8 September, the last section to Weischlitz followed on 20 September of the same year, and the line formed a junction with the Plauen–Eger railway. The construction of the many bridges and eight tunnels drove the operating company "(Sächsisch-Thüringische Eisenbahngesellschaft)" into financial difficulties in 1876, so that the line had to be sold to the Saxon State Railway ("Sächsische Staatsbahn"). Not until 1 December 1892 was there a direct connexion from Wünschendorf to Gera at the station of Gera Reuß, which no longer exists but was near the site of the present-day Gera Süd. On the same date traffic on the line from Wünschendorf to Wolfsgefärth was withdrawn.

Dennis Waight

Colonel Dennis Edward Francis Waight (15 February 1895 – October 1984) was a British army professional infantryman. After being decorated for valor while serving as a fusilier early in World War I, he flew in combat as an aerial observer until war's end. No details of his transfer and training are known; however, he was credited with 12 aerial victories, making him a flying ace.
He continued in service both at home and in India through, and beyond, World War II, finally being retired from service for age.
Early life.
Waight was reared in St John's Wood, London. He was a member of Beevors House at Aldenham School, which he attended from April 1910–December 1912. He played first string football while there.
World War I.
Waight was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant on 22 September 1914. Waight was serving as a temporary lieutenant when he was promoted to temporary captain on 16 September 1916 while he was serving in the Northumberland Fusiliers. He earned a Military Cross while serving with the unit; he then transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in March 1918. His Military Cross was gazetted on 3 June 1918.
Waight was assigned to 22 Squadron as an observer; he sat in the back seat of a two-seated Bristol F.2 Fighter and manned the rear machine guns to ward off attacks from behind. On 10 July 1918, Waight scored his first victory while piloted by ace T. W. Martin; he drove down a German Pfalz D.III fighter over Lille.
Waight would not score again until he was involved in the British offensive at the Battle of Amiens. On 8 August 1918, while piloted by William Frederick James Harvey, Waight shared in the destruction of two Pfalz D.IIIs in a dogfight northeast of Vitry; at least one of the shared wins was credited to another crew from 22 Squadron, John Everard Gurdon and Charles George Gass. On the evening of 11 August, he sent down a Fokker D.VII out of control southeast of Armentières, France for his fourth win. On the 13th, he destroyed a Rumpler and drove down its Pfalz D.III escort out of control northwest of Cambrai for victories five and six. The next day, a German two-seater fell from his guns, out of control southwest of Lille. Two days later, Waight destroyed a Pfalz D.III southeast of Lille. On 21 August, the victim was another unidentified German two-seater down out of control, this time over Ervillers. The next day, 22 August 1918, the crew of Waight and Harvey scored their last victory together; teamed with other crews from 22 Squadron, they destroyed a Halberstadt reconnaissance two-seater northeast of Bailleul. Waight finished out August 1918 by destroying a Fokker D.VII over Douai while piloted by South African ace Ian Oliver Stead.
Waight would score one more victory, a week before the Armistice; piloted by Stanley Wallage, he drove down a Pfalz D.XII out of control northwest of Bavay for the final victory for both himself and his squadron. Waight's personal victory score tallied as six enemy planes destroyed, two of which were shared; he also drove down six enemy planes out of control.
Post World War I.
On 16 March 1922, Lieutenant Waight's commission as second lieutenant in the Fusiliers was backdated to 22 June 1915. On 28 March 1922, his commission as lieutenant was backdated to 1 July 1917 and his precedence ranked on that day's seniority list. The following day, he was promoted to captain.
On 13 November 1929, Captain Waight was seconded from the Northumberland Fusiliers to staff duty. He vacated his appointment on the Indian Army staff on 1 March 1931, and returned to the Fusiliers the next day.
On 11 January 1932, he was appointed Adjutant of the Fusiliers' 6th Battalion. The next issue of the London Gazette specified that his service as Adjutant would be with the Territorial Army. Waight was relieved from his post of Adjutant on 11 January 1936. He returned to his regimental establishment 21 January 1936. On 29 September 1936, Waight was promoted to Major–still in the Fusiliers.
World War II and beyond.
On 16 November 1942, Major Waight became Lieutenant Colonel Waight.
On 16 November 1945, Waight was retained on full pay as a supernumerary. On 28 September 1947, Lieutenant Colonel Waight was retired as too old to continue serving his nation. He was granted a retirement promotion to honorary Colonel. His release from the Reserve of Officers, based on his age, came on 15 February 1950.
Colonel Waight died in Liskeard, Cornwall in October 1984.

Beige (novel)

Beige is a young adult novel by Cecil Castellucci. It was published by Candlewick Press in 2007 and is Castellucci's third novel.
Plot summary.
Katy Ratner Berneir is a fourteen-year-old born and raised in Montreal Canada. Both her parents had substance abuse issues but her mother conquered them first so naturally she is the person that raised her. Katy has never been apart from her mother and has barely spent any time with her father. Even though she was raised with her mother and is extremely close to her, she is not a very important character in the book. That is her background before the actual story begins to unfold. The protagonist finds out that she has go and stay the whole summer with her dad. She is not happy in the slightest way possible. She begins to ask her dad questions about her mother and is actually surprised to hear some things that she never knew. She starts hanging out with Lake Suck who is the daughter of her father's best friend. Lake is one of the key characters because she causes a lot of changes in Katy and helps her see life from a different perspective. She has a lot of issues with Lake because of their personality and background differences. Katy gets introduced to a person named Garth Skater. Katy thinks Garth is a girl but later finds out that he is a boy. Garth is a huge fan of Suck (her father's band) and is really nice to everybody. There’s this boy named Leo that Katy has a huge crush on. She is eventually persuaded to try things out even if she doesn't like them. She eventually starts liking Trixie (her father’s girlfriend) and actually admires her.
Reception.
"Beige" received both bad and good reviews. Influential school librarian and blogger Cindy Dobrez wrote that "Catellucci gives a fresh spin to the familiar exiled-teen plot by mixing details of the L.A. punk scene with memorable characters and witty dialogue. By the end of the story, Katy has lost some of her Beige ways, and the lessons she has learned will help her deal with a sudden change in her mother's plan." However, in a review for School Library Journal, Emily R. Brown wrote, "This book lacks the details—from teenage sign language to sci-fi trivia—that gave Castellucci's other books credibility."

True Believer (novel)

True Believer is a verse novel for young adults, written by Virginia Euwer Wolff and published by Atheneum Books in 2001.
It won the U.S. National Book Award for Young People's Literature.
A review in "Publishers Weekly" observed that Wolff writes with "delicacy and sensitivity".
Reception and themes.
According to an interview with "Horn Book Magazine", Wolff never identified the race of the characters purposefully, because she wanted readers to have their own views of them.
"Horn Book Magazine" mentioned the theme of romantic feeling that can take over everyday life. Roger Sutton, the reviewer, said that "LaVaughn's portrayal of her life at school and home becomes shaped by her feelings for Jody." 
"Publishers Weekly" summarized the overall theme as "one of the pivotal issues of puberty": abstinence.

Frankie &amp; The Heartstrings

Frankie & The Heartstrings are a Sunderland-based indie rock band that formed in 2008. The band's debut album, "Hunger" was released on 21 February 2011, and debuted at No. 32 on the UK albums chart.
History.
Singer Frankie Francis and guitarist Michael McKnight were at college together. Drummer Dave Harper and McKnight had played in local bands for years. McKnight and Harper met Francis at a calypso night in a pub the singer was running at the time in Sunderland and formed the band in December 2008. Singer Francis had intended to play bass in the band, but Harper said that "He was the worst bassist ever". The band made their live debut in Christmas 2008 after friend Steve Dennis joined on bass. Former Kenickie drummer, Jonny X, now known by his real name Pete Gofton, joined as a keyboardist. Pete Gofton has since left (in 2010) and was replaced with Soundtracks For A B-Movie and Minotaurs guitarist Mick Ross. It has been said that Mick "adds steel, bite and panache to their musicianship". Other band names that were considered included Pop Sex and The New Groomers, but they settled on Frankie & The Heartstrings.
The band's debut release was a 10" 7 track live EP "12.09.09", released on their own Pop Sex Ltd records in a limited edition of 500 in November 2009. The following month they followed it up with a double A side 7" single "Hunger/Fragile" released on Rough Trade. That month they played their first major tour supporting Florence & The Machine.
In April 2010, the band released their second single "Tender / I Want You Back", recorded with James Ford of Simian Mobile Disco. Further gigging continued throughout 2010 including slots at the Glastonbury Festival, Summer Sundae and Latitude Festival, overseas shows in Europe, New York and Tokyo and support slots across the UK supporting The Futureheads and Edwyn Collins, who produced the band’s debut album in the late summer and early Autumn at his West Heath Studios in London. The band released their third single "Ungrateful" in October 2010.
Titled "Hunger", Frankie and the Heartstrings' debut album was released in the UK on 21 February 2011; it charted at No. 32 on the UK albums chart. Single "The Postcard" followed on 9 May 2011. The band then went on to support Kaiser Chiefs and The Vaccines on their UK tours later in the year. A non-"Hunger"-related single, "Everybody Looks Better (In the Right Light)", produced by Suede guitarist Bernard Butler, was released on 28 November 2011. Its b-side, "The Way That You Kiss", was produced by Ryan Jarman of The Cribs.
The band's sound has drawn comparisons to Orange Juice and Dexy's Midnight Runners.
"The Days Run Away" and Pop Recs Ltd.
The band released their second album, "The Days Run Away", on 3 June 2013.
The band opened their own record store in Sunderland, called Pop Recs Ltd in June 2013. The store was initially only to be open for two weeks as a pop up store to promote "The Days Run Away", but community response provoked the band to continue operating it permanently.

39th Army (Soviet Union)

The 39th Army was a Field Army of the Soviet Union's Red Army formed on 15 November 1941 in the Arkhangelsk Military District, in accordance with a directive issued by the Stavka (command headquarters) on 2 November 1941. The army was directly subordinate to the Stavka.
On 1 December 1941 the army was listed by the Soviet General Staff's official order of battle listings as including seven rifle divisions and two cavalry divisions (355th, 357th, 361st, 369th, 373rd, 377th, and 381st Rifle Divisions, plus 76th and 94th Cavalry Divisions.
Kalinin Offensive.
On 1 December 1941 the army was tasked to build defense lines along the eastern bank of the river Sheksna. After regrouping in the area of Torzhok it was sent to the Kalinin Front on 22 December, where the 39th Army took part in the Kalinin Offensive Operation. The Kalinin Offensive Operation had begun on 5 December 1941 and was one part of the Moscow Strategic Counter-Offensive. The army was within the joint sector of the 22nd Army and 29th Army under the command of Lieutenant-General Ivan Maslennikov. At the end of December the 39th Army broke through the enemy defenses to a significant depth. During the battles of 2–7 January 1942 the troops on the right wing reached the Volga River and those in the center broke through a new line of defense organized by the enemy on the right bank of the Volga, covering Rzhev from the west and southwest. By the end of the operation on 8 January 1942 the 39th Army had reached the north-west of Rzhev.
The Sychevsk-Vyazma Offensive Operation (8 January – 20 April 1942) began immediately and the 39th Army broke through the enemy defenses in a narrow sector, expanding its offensive on Sychevka and providing a corridor through the enemy front for the 29th Army and 11th Cavalry Corps (commanded by Colonel S.V. Sokolov). By the end of January 1942 its troops came to the Vyazma-Smolensk railway on the north of Yartsevo where they met stubborn resistance of the enemy troops. In early February the enemy counter-attacks from Rzhev and Olenino stopped the advance of Soviet troops and the Russian troops on the Kalinin Front were forced into a defensive situation. This resulted in the Kholm-Zhirkovsky ledge being connected to the Kalinin Front by a narrow corridor between Nelidovo and Bely, where the 39th Army faced the threatening situation of having their lines of communication cut by the enemy. The 2nd Shock Army at the Volkhov Front was in a similar situation in the same time.
Kalinin defense.
From February to June 1942 the 39th Army was fighting in the north-west of Vyazma-Kholm-Zhirkovsky in a defensive role. Here the 39th Army engaged in the defense of a salient which contained an enormous enemy force, caused by the 9th Army who were involved in Operation Seydlitz. The German operation began on 2 July, against the troops of 39th Army and 11th Cavalry Corps, which occupied the Kholm-Zhirkovsky ledge. The Germans attacked at the narrowest part of the corridor, approximately 27–28 km, attacking in the direction of Bely and Olenino. By 6 July, the German troops had closed the corridor and the 39th Army and 11th Cavalry Corps were in encirclement and then dissected into two groups. By 8 July, the 11th Cavalry Corps were subordinated to the 39th Army. The German army ceased Operation Seydlitz when it "officially ended on July 12, after reporting by radio from the Fuhrer's headquarters: 'The victory in the Summer Battle of Rzhev'."
Evacuation and disbandment.
On 17 July, around 8,000 troops of the 39th Army, under the command by Maslennikov, crossed the river Obshu (which passes the Bely from northeast to southwest) to land on the north bank and occupied the area north of the village Shizderevo. On 18 July, by order of the Kalinin Front commander, the military council of 39th Army with a group of staff officers and the wounded were evacuated in nine Po-2 light aircraft in Andreapol, of which three planes crashed. Surrounded parts of the 39th Army had been ordered to obey the Deputy of Maslennikov, Lieutenant-General Bogdanov, and the deputy of the political commissar of 39th Army, Division Commissar Shabalin. Battles continued for three weeks while the Germans tried to destroy the encircled groups of the 39th Army.
In late July 1942 the individual units were released from the front and, with no troops, the 39th Army was disbanded.
Soviet invasion of Manchuria and after.
On 1 May 1945, 39th Army was transferred to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. That day, 39th Army rifle units consisted of 5th Guards Rifle Corps (17th, 19th and 91st Guards Rifle Divisions), 94th Rifle Corps (124th, 221st, and 358th Rifle Divisions), and 113th Rifle Corps (192nd, 262nd, and 338th Rifle Divisions). Artillery forces included 139 пабр, 610 иптап, 555 минп, and the 621st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment (зенап).
In May–June 1945 39th Army was relocated to Mongolia and on 20 June it was included in the Transbaikal Front under Marshal Rodion Malinovsky. It then took part in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. In the Khingan-Mukden operations (9 August - 2 September) Army troops attacked from Tamtsag-Bulagskogo protrusion forces Japanese Third Area Army Kwantung Army (30 A, 44 A), and the left flank of 4th Independent Army. After defeating the enemy, covering the approaches to the passes Greater Xing'an, the army seized Halun Arshansky-fortified area. Developing the offensive in the Changchun, advanced fought for 350–400 km, and taking Ulan-Hoto and Solon. By 14 August it had reached the central part of Manchuria. Expanding the offensive to the south, part of the army in conjunction with the 6th Guards Tank Army released on 19 August Mukden, 20 August - Changchun entered Kvantun and 21 August took Dalian, and on 22 August Port Arthur on the Chinese coast.
From 1945-55 the 39th Army was stationed at Port Arthur. In Port Arthur was a naval base, the commander of which was Vice-Admiral Vasily A. Tsipanovich. In 1948, the Shandong Peninsula, 200 kilometers from the Far, acting U.S. military base. Every day there appeared a reconnaissance plane and at low altitude on the same route flew over and photographed the Soviet and Chinese sites, airfields. Soviet pilots stopped the flights. Americans sent a note to the Foreign Ministry in a statement about the attack on the Soviet fighters "off course light passenger aircraft," but reconnaissance flights over Liaodong stopped. In June, 1948, in Port Arthur, a major joint exercise of all arms was undertaken. Malinowski managed the whole exercise, from Khabarovsk arrived SA Krasovsky - Far East Air Force commander BO. Exercise was held in two main stages. On the ground - a reflection of marines imaginary enemy. The second - an imitation of massed bombing.
In Port Arthur was deployed the 113th Rifle Corps headquarters of Lieutenant General Tereshkova (338th Infantry Division - the area of Port Arthur, Dalny, 358th from the Far to the north boundary of the zone, 262 Rifle Division along the northern border of the peninsula, the headquarters of 5 Artillery Corps, 150th Fortified Region, 139 apabr. 7th Regiment separate communication provided connection between parts on the Liaodong, as well as Moscow and Vladivostok.

After the war, she became known as "the glory of the Motherland", the editor - Lieutenant Colonel BL Krasovsky. Naval Base USSR. 
In the area of Jinzhou City headquarters stationed 5th Guards Rifle Corps Lt. Gen. L. Alekseeva, 19, 91 and 17th Guards Rifle Division under the command of Major General Eugene L. Korkutsa. Chief of Staff Lieutenant Strashnenko. The division includes the 21th separate battalion, on the basis of which the Chinese volunteers were trained. 26th Guards cannon artillery regiment, the 46th Regiment of Guards mortar, part of the 6th Division Artillery breakthrough torpedo regiment Pacific Fleet. At Dalihem (Dalian?) was based the 33rd gun Division Headquarters 7th BAC, air units, the 14th zenad, 119 th Infantry Regiment guarded the port, plus elements of the Soviet Navy. 
To address the issue of troop withdrawal in 1954 in Port Arthur Nikita Khrushchev arrived. He gave the military five months for withdrawal. 2 October 1954 a communiqué was signed on redeployment of the 39th Army and Navy units. By that time, the Soviet Union had in China six rifle and one mechanized division, a Division patrol boats, crew submarines, torpedo boats brigade, the brigade of water region, coastal defense forces and air defense, naval bombers (potentially including the 130th Maritime Torpedo Aviation Division) and fighter Air Division Air Corps (37th Fighter Aviation Division?). On 31 May 1955 and the deployment of troops over. Capital facilities and most of the equipment transferred to China. Almost everything was free of charge, including dozens of torpedo boats, tanks, submarines, all the ammunition. On the day of departure of troops solemn construction in parts where the Chinese gave the keys to the property. To the sound of the Soviet anthem was lowered naval flag of the Soviet Union, and then was replaced by a Chinese flag. Conclusion took 8 months. After retiring in Port Arthur for a while there were still Soviet specialists who taught Chinese sailors.
Reduction and then disbanding the 39th Army began in 1955. The Army was disbanded in 1956 as part of Maritime Military District.
After the war, the army was stationed for many years in Mongolia, with its headquarters at Ulan Bator. Soviet perceptions of threat from China increased in the 1960s. A number of measures were taken to increase troop strength in the Transbaikal and in Mongolia. From the Baltic to the Far East came the 21st Guards Tank Division, of the Leningrad Military District in the ZabVO – 2nd Guards Tank Division. It also deployed 5th Guards Tank Division, 32nd, 66th, 49th, and 111th Tank Divisions. By the early 1970s the 39th Combined-Arms Army had been strengthened in the Transbaikal, while in Mongolia there was formed a progressive group from the 39th Army. 
In the late 1980s the army consisted of the 2nd Guards Tank Division, 51st Tank Division, and 12th, 41st, and 149th Motor Rifle Divisions. The withdrawal of troops from Mongolia took 28 months. On 4 February 1989 a Sino-Soviet agreement was signed to reduce troops on the border. 15 May 1989 and the Soviet government announced a partial, then the complete withdrawal of 39th Army of the Transbaikal Military District from Mongolia. The army consisted of more than 50,000 soldiers, 1816 tanks, 2531 armored vehicles, 1461 artillery systems, 190 aircraft and 130 helicopters. On 25 September 1992 the completion of the withdrawal was officially announced. The last Russian troops left Mongolia in December 1992.

Galerucella calmariensis

Galerucella calmariensis is a species of leaf beetle in the family Chrysomelidae. It is commonly known as the black-margined loosestrife beetle and is native to Europe and Asia where both adults and larvae feed on purple loosestrife ("Lythrum salicaria"). It has been introduced in North America as a biological control agent for purple loosestrife.
Description.
The black-margined loosestrife beetle is cylindrical in shape, mid brown, three to six millimetres long and half that width. When seen from above it often has two blackish lateral lines down either side. The eggs are spherical, white and usually topped with frass. The larvae are yellow speckled with black and resemble small caterpillars.
Biology.
Adults overwinter in leaf litter near purple loosestrife plants. They emerge in the spring and start to feed on the young growth. They cause damage to the leaves characterised by neat rounded shot holes between the veins. The females lay up to 500 eggs from May to July in small batches on leaves and stems. On hatching, the first instar larvae feed on growing shoot tips and may kill them. Later instars feed on stems and leaves leaving the upper cuticle of the leaf intact. When the density of the larvae is high enough, the plant can be completely defoliated. After feeding for about three weeks and undergoing further moults, the larvae move down the plant to pupate in the soil or leaf litter. If the water level is high, larvae sometimes pupate in the hollow aerenchyma tissue in the plant stems. Both adults and larvae can float and may be wafted by water currents or wind to new host plants.
Damage.
Larval damage to buds and shoots reduces the growth of the purple loosestrife plant and its ability to flower and produce seed. Damage to the leaves reduces their photosynthetic capability and means there is less starch stored in the roots which may cause plant death in adverse winter conditions. It also results in less vigorous plants which do not compete so strongly with native plant species such as cattails, grasses and sedges. 
Use in biological control.
Purple loosestrife is a native of Europe, Asia, northwest Africa and parts of Australia. In these countries a number of insects are associated with it. These include the weevil "Hylobius transversovittatus" and the leaf beetles "G. calmariensis" and "G. pusilla". When purple loosestrife was introduced into North America no insects were available to keep it under control and it became rampant. It is now found in large stands throughout the northeastern United States, southeastern Canada and the American Midwest where it crowds out other species and is a threat to biodiversity.
The black-margined loosestrife beetle and the closely related golden loosestrife beetle ("Galerucella pusilla") have been released in over 27 states in the United States and 6 Canadian provinces. The adults of both species have become well established and proved very effective. They show great ability to find new stands of the host plant and can locate patches of purple loosestrife a kilometre away within a few days of emergence.
Before these beetles were introduced to North America, the susceptibility of approximately 50 native plants of North America to the beetles was tested in Europe. Among the plants were several close relatives of purple loosestrife.

Crime Without Passion

Crime Without Passion is a 1934 American drama film directed by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, starring Claude Rains. It is the first of four pictures written, produced and directed by Hecht and MacArthur for Paramount Pictures. Sixty to seventy percent of the film was directed by cinematographer Lee Garmes. 
The plot centers around a clever and suave but unscrupulous and dishonest lawyer, Lee Gentry (Rains) who boasts that he "lives by lies". His attempts to finish his affair with a clinging, besotted cabaret artist do not go according to plan. Rains is on top form and turns in a marvellously wicked performance.

DeLeon Plaza and Bandstand

DeLeon Plaza and Bandstand is 1.77 acres originally platted as the center of the city of Victoria, county of Victoria, in the U.S. state of Texas. The bandstand stood nearby the plaza until it was moved to the center of the plaza in 1923. The William P. Rogers chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy contracted with sculptor Pompeo Coppini for the DeLeon Plaza's 1912 monument to the Confederacy "The Last Stand" (aka "Firing Line"). 
On March 24, 1987, DeLeon Plaza and Bandstand was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Victoria County, Texas. In 1965, the bandstand was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark, Marker number 289. In 1998, the plaza was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark, Marker number 12273.
Plaza.
When Victoria, Texas was founded by "empresario" Martín De León and his wife Patricia de la Garza De León, they named it after Guadalupe Victoria, who had just become the first president of Mexico. The town was platted by surveyor José María Jesús Carbajal around a Market Square, which is today DeLeon Plaza.
Sculptor Pompeo Coppini was paid $5,000, raised by the William P. Rogers chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, to create the plaza's monument "The Last Stand" (aka "Firing Line") in 1912. The unveiling was held on July 12 of that year. The celebratory event was the scene of a parade and a barbecue that was free to everyone. The ceremony included various dignitaries, two Union Army veterans, and twelve Confederate States Army veterans.
In 1923, the "Memorial White Way" lighting was turned on at DeLeon Plaza. That same year the bandstand, which had been built in 1885 and previously stood nearby, was moved to this location and placed over the site of the town's old water source.
The landscaping was re-done in 1940 as a project of the Works Progress Administration under the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose public works and welfare projects helped many people throughout the South. Mr. and Mrs. J. M. Pickering completed a restoration of the bandstand in 1962. That same year, a Six Flags monument was placed on the plaza at the corner of Main and Constitution streets. The plaza today has twenty-three benches and forty-seven trees of live oak, elm, pecan, ash, magnolia, and redwood.
On December 31, 1986, a time capsule was placed in DeLeon Plaza, to be opened at the 2036 Texas Bicentennial.
