Plot.
A professional skateboarder named Tony Valdez is severely injured by mind-controlled zombies created through nano-technology the day his parents mysteriously die in an accident secretly caused by his father's business partner Nigel Harrington. It seems likely that he'll never walk again until Tony's friend Sammi outfits him with similar nano-technology. It is only with the help of this new technology that Valdez is able to regain his mobility and also gain superhuman abilities as a side effect. But it turns out the technology that both healed him and allowed the creation of the zombies is connected to the death of his parents, who invented it. With new powers at his disposal, Valdez fights off the zombie threat and discovers more about the murderer of his parents and his true enemy, a minion who works for Nigel known as Taipan.

Grand Slam of Eventing

The Grand Slam of Eventing, sponsored by Rolex, consists of three of the top CCI**** eventing competitions in the world. To win the Grand Slam, a rider must consecutively win all three events, although they are permitted to ride different horses in each competition. This is especially important, since the Badminton Horse Trials is only one week after Kentucky, and the horse would not have sufficient time to recover between the two competitions, especially since he/she would have to be flown overseas in that time. 
The three events that make up the Grand Slam are:
Winners receive an extra $350,000, in addition to their winnings from each event.
Past winners.
The Grand Slam of Eventing began in 1999, and has since only been won by one rider.

Empire (apple)

Empire is the name of a clonally-propagated cultivar of apple derived from a seed grown in 1945 by Lester C. Anderson, a Cornell University fruit nutritionist who conducted open pollination research on his various orchards.
In 1945, under the direction of A. J. Heinicke, scientists from the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station of Cornell University in Geneva, New York, harvested the Empire seed, together with thousands of its siblings. The Geneva teams grew and tested ever dwindling sub-populations of the sibling group until 1966, when the final selection, the Empire, was released to the public at the New York Fruit Testing Association meetings in Geneva.
Description.
Empire apples are red, juicy, firm, crunchy and sweet. They ripen during September and October, and will keep until January.
The original seed was a cross between the varieties "McIntosh" and "Red Delicious". Empire apples are excellent for eating and salads, and good for sauce, baking, pies and freezing. It is an ideal lunch-box apple, not least because it does not bruise easily.
Sports patented in the US.
By the year 2001, three mutant cultivars (sports) of Empire had received US plant patents. None of them were mutants of mutants:

__NOTOC__
The UK Green Building Council (UKGBC) is a United Kingdom membership organisation, formed in 2007, which aims to 'radically transform' the way that the built environment in the UK is planned, designed, constructed, maintained and operated.
The Council is concerned about the environmental impact of buildings and infrastructure on the environment, in particular the use of water, materials, energy, the impact of greenhouse gas emissions, and the health of building occupants.
Formation.
The organisation was founded in the autumn of 2006 and launched on February 2007 in response to the "2004 Sustainable Building Task Group Report", which called for the "advisory bodies concerned with sustainable buildings to be simplified and consolidated to provide a clear direction for industry".
UKGBC is a charitable organisation, and - through the World Green Building Council - is part of a global network of like-minded organisations in almost 80 countries.

Jim Britt

Jim Britt (April 11, 1910 — December 31, 1980) was an American sportscaster who broadcast Major League Baseball games in Boston, Massachusetts, and Cleveland, Ohio, during the 1940s and 1950s. On June 15, 1948, Britt was at the microphone on WBZ-TV for the first live telecast of a Major League game in New England, as the Boston Braves defeated the Chicago Cubs, 6–3, at Braves Field.
Boston Braves and Red Sox.
From 1940 through 1950, with time out for United States Navy service in World War II, Britt was the voice of both the National League Boston Braves and the American League Boston Red Sox, as the two teams broadcast home games only.
Because the MLB schedules were then arranged so that the two Boston clubs were never home at the same time, there were no schedule conflicts. As such, Britt was the voice of two pennant-winning clubs, the 1946 Red Sox and the 1948 Braves. At the close of the 1950 season, that co-operative arrangement ended and each team decided to air a full schedule of 154 games, home and away. Britt chose to stay with the Braves, and the Red Sox were left to look for their own lead announcer.
As fate would have it, the Sox would hire the "second banana" for the New York Yankees — a Mel Allen protégé named Curt Gowdy — who would be the voice of the Red Sox for 15 years before moving on to NBC's "Game of the Week" and a place in the Baseball Hall of Fame as a Ford C. Frick Award winner. Meanwhile, the Braves' attendance fell disastrously in 1951 and 1952, and the club moved to Milwaukee during 1953 spring training.
Cleveland Indians and national work.
Britt did not accompany the Braves to Wisconsin. Instead, he joined the TV announcing crew of the Cleveland Indians in 1954, working through 1957 with Ken Coleman, a native of the Boston area (and Gowdy's eventual successor, in 1966, as voice of the Red Sox). The highlight of Britt's Cleveland tenure was the Indians' 1954 American League pennant with their league-record 111–43 season (one game better than the 110–44 1927 Yankees). But the Indians were upset in four straight games by the New York Giants in the ensuing 1954 World Series.
Nationally, Britt participated in the Mutual network radio coverage of the World Series in 1948 and 1950, and worked on NBC's television coverage of the Series in 1949 and 1951. He also announced several baseball All-Star Games in the late 1940s and early '50s, as well as NFL games on the DuMont network and college football coverage (including the 1953 Sugar Bowl game) on ABC.
Return to Boston.
Britt returned to Boston in the late 1950s as a sportscaster for the city's ABC affiliate, then WHDH-TV, which also telecast Red Sox games; but he never regained his former role announcing for the Sox. Instead, he initiated a popular candlepin bowling show he would host until 1961, and also hosted "Dateline: Boston" (a nonsports predecessor to many of the modern-day magazine-style television programs) and an ABC-TV network series of hourlong 18-hole matches between two golfers called "All-Star Golf" featuring the best of their time including Ben Hogan, Sammy Snead, Lloyd Mangrum and Billy Casper.
He died at 70 in San Francisco, California.

Evan Morgan, 2nd Viscount Tredegar

Evan Frederic Morgan, 2nd Viscount Tredegar of the second creation of the title (July 13, 1893 – April 27, 1949) was a Welsh poet and author. The only son of Courtenay Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar second creation, of Tredegar Park, Monmouthshire, and Lady Katharine Carnegie, he was a chamberlain to Popes Benedict XV and Pius XI yet, as an accomplished occultist, was hailed by Aleister Crowley as "Adept of Adepts".
Morgan came from what the Duke of Bedford described as "the oddest family I have ever met"; his mother is rumoured to have built bird nests big enough to sit in; in 1925 his sister, Gwyneth Ericka Morgan, was found dead aged 29 in the River Thames, while his father owned one of the largest yachts in the world.
A noted eccentric, he kept at his seat of Tredegar House in Newport a menagerie of animals including a boxing kangaroo, honey bear, baboon and macaw. His weekend house parties, which attracted such figures as Aldous Huxley, H. G. Wells, Augustus John and Aleister Crowley, gained local notoriety, as did the host's extravagant lifestyle.
Morgan succeeded to the titles of 4th Baron, 3rd Viscount Tredegar in May 1934 on the death of his father.
Despite his known homosexuality and reputation for dissipation, he married twice. His wives were:
A review of Evan Morgan's life and times, with a transcript of his Court Martial for offences against the Official Secrets Acts in 1943 is in the book " Aspects of Evan : The Last Viscount Tredegar", from Monty Dart and William Cross, authors of " A Beautiful Nuisance : The Life and Death of the Hon. Gwyneth Ericka Morgan, a book which has many references to Evan as well as revealing the full story about Evan's only sibling, Gwyneth.
Evan Morgan is also the subject of the book "Not Behind Lace Curtains : The Hidden World of Evan, Viscount Tredegar", from William Cross, FSA Scot. This book explores Evan's homosexuality, his dabbles in the occult and with the Black Masses.

ERA-40

ERA-40 is an ECMWF re-analysis of the global atmosphere and surface conditions for 45-years, over the period from September 1957 through August 2002 by ECMWF. Many sources of the meteorological observations were used, including radiosondes, balloons, aircraft, buoyes, satellites, scatterometers. This data was run through the ECMWF computer model at a 40 km resolution. As the ECMWF's computer model is one of the more highly regarded in the field of forecasting, many scientists take its reanalysis to have similar merit. The data is stored in GRIB format. The reanalysis was done in an effort to improve the accuracy of historical weather maps and aid in a more detailed analysis of various weather systems through a period that was severely lacking in computerized data. With the data from reanalyses such as this, many of the more modern computerized tools for analyzing storm systems can be utilized, at least in part, because of this access to a computerized simulation of the atmospheric state.

Las Vegas–Paradise, NV MSA

The Las Vegas–Paradise, NV MSA, also known as the Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, NV Metropolitan Statistical Area (2013) or the Las Vegas metropolitan area, is in the southern part of the U.S. state of Nevada, coextensive since 2003 with Clark County, Nevada. A central part of the metropolitan area is the Las Vegas Valley, a basin that includes the metropolitan area's largest city, Las Vegas as well as the other primary city, Paradise, Nevada. The area contains the largest concentration of people in the state. Cities in the metropolitan area include Las Vegas, Henderson, North Las Vegas, and Boulder City.
History.
The metropolitan area was created for the 1970 census when it only included Clark County. In 2000, the metropolitan area was changed to include Nye County, Nevada and Mohave County, Arizona. This area appears to have existed since at least 1967 when the census bureau defined the SMSAs outside of New England as, ""a county or group of contiguous counties which contains at least one city of 50,000 inhabitants in addition to the county or counties containing such a city or cities, contiguous counties are included in an SMSA if, according to certain criteria, they are socially and economically integrated with the central city.""
Demographics.
As of the census of 2000, there were 1,375,765 people, 512,253 households, and 339,693 families residing within the MSA. The racial makeup of the MSA was 71.6% White (60.2% White Non-Hispanic), 9.1% Black, 5.7% Asian, 0.8% American Indian and 12.8% of other or mixed race. 22.0% were Hispanic of any race. As of 2009, the population in the metropolitan area had grown up to 1,902,834 people, being one of the fastest growing MSA in the United States.
In 1999, the median income for a household in the MSA was $44,616 and the median income for a family was $50,485. The per capita income was $21,785.
The United States Census Bureau 2009 estimates place the population for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Statistical Area at 1,902,834 people, and the region is one of the fastest growing in the United States. Large numbers of new residents in the state originate from California.
Office of Management and Budget definition.
The United States Office of Management and Budget has designated Clark County as the Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, NV Metropolitan Statistical Area. The United States Census Bureau ranked the Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, NV Metropolitan Statistical Area as the 31st most populous metropolitan statistical area of the United States as of July 1, 2012.
The Office of Management and Budget has further designated the Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, NV Metropolitan Statistical Area as a component of the more extensive Las Vegas-Henderson, NV-AZ Combined Statistical Area, the 27th most populous combined statistical area and the 30th most populous primary statistical area of the United States as of July 1, 2012.
Tourism.
In calendar year 2011, the majority of tourists arrived from the western states (55%) with 31% from California alone. Approximately 16% of tourists arrived from outside of North America. There is a growing interest in Las Vegas among Chinese tourists, with arrivals growing at an annual rate of 30%.

Peace Corps service.
His public service career began as a Peace Corps volunteer in Peru, where during 1965 and 1966 he spent 18 months in a Peruvian slum running a food distribution program and setting up credit unions. He called the experience a defining moment and said his experience in the Peace Corps helped him learn how to adapt. "When I was a Peace Corps volunteer, it was just a different culture," McPherson said. "I found I couldn't be a gringo and be effective. It's just a matter of asking people what they want to get done, finding out what the formal and informal rules are and figuring out ways to do things differently, while doing practical work in that environment. But that process was a challenge."
Service in Ford and Reagan Administrations.
After law school, he worked for the Internal Revenue Service, where his specialty was international taxation. He joined the administration of fellow Michigander Gerald Ford in 1975 as special assistant to the President. Dick Cheney was White House Chief of Staff. 
After his government service in the Ford administration, he worked in private law practice as managing partner of the Washington office of Vorys, Sater, Seymour and Pease, an Ohio law firm.
In November, 1980 he was named general counsel to the Reagan-Bush transition.
McPherson held several high-level positions in President Ronald Reagan's administration including head of USAID from 1981 to 1987 where he led the U.S. response to the famine in Africa. "At AID, you learn the process of deciding as a group large issues," McPherson said
McPherson's interest in world humanitarian and agricultural issues has made a difference for millions of people. While administrator of USAID he was also chair of the board of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.
McPherson served as Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department from 1987 to 1989.
After his service in the Reagan administration, McPherson worked for Bank of America from 1989 to 1993 managing $600 million as the bank's executive vice president.
President of Michigan State University.
In 1993 he was selected to become President of Michigan State University from 171 publicly identified candidates.
During his tenure as President of MSU, the school's international undergraduate study program became the nation's largest. McPherson also gets credit as the only president of a major university to keep tuition at the rate of inflation and for spearheading a $1 billion capital fund-raising campaign and for bringing a private law school to the 45,000-student campus. McPherson retired from MSU in 2004. [http://www.mlive.com/news/sanews/index.ssf?/base/news-0/108454461013330.xml]
McPherson took a leave of absence as President of MSU in 2003 to serve as the Director of Economic Policy for the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance in Iraq, where he helped establish a central bank and develop a new currency. In August, 2004, McPherson, who spent four months in Iraq, was among five recipients presented with the Distinguished Service Award by U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow for his service in Iraq.

The Financial Times reported on December 13, 2007 that McPherson led the final annual meeting of Dow Jones where stockholders voted to approve the $5 billion sale of the 125-year-old company including the Wall Street Journal to Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. "I know I speak for so many today when I say that this has been a difficult—and for many—a sad set of discussions," said McPherson, offering "great expectations and hopes" for the future.
Other activities.
Aside from his duties as Chairman of Dow Jones, McPherson is a Founding Co-Chair and serves as a Director of the Partnership to Cut Hunger and Poverty in Africa.

President of APLU.
As President of the APLU, McPherson has been a prime mover behind “College Portrait," a template for information that public, four-year institutions will provide online in an easily comparable way. College Portrait has three parts: student and family information, student experiences and perceptions, and student learning outcomes. "If we can’t figure out how to measure ourselves, someone else will figure out how to measure us," McPherson said. “It’s inevitable." McPherson says that universities need to focus on the big picture and support the new system or the federal government will come in and define how assessment will take place. "If we wait for the perfect test, we’d be waiting 10 years from now," says McPherson. “You need to take a step like this to force the pace," McPherson added.
BIFAD Chair.
McPherson was appointed by the white house in 2002 as the new chairman to the Board for International Food and Agricultural development (BIFAD). BIFAD advises USAID on the topics of food and agricultural safety in the developing world. He was suceeded in 2007 by Robert Easter.

Mount Potts

Mount Potts is a specialist backcountry station located in the upper reaches of the Rangitata Valley, Canterbury, New Zealand. In 1964 the original Mt Potts homestead, shearer's quarters and wool-shed were converted into an accommodation and restaurant complex, known as Mt Potts Lodge today.
Today Mt Potts Station is a working cattle farm, restaurant and lodge, which doubles up as a heliski base in the winter. Unlike normal resorts, there are no fixed ski tows or chairlifts. Instead, vertical transport is provided by snowcats and helicopter. The ski area covers 660 hectares and includes, "steep faces, chutes, rocks to drop off, cornices, wide open powder bowls and gullies" 
Mount Potts is an hour's drive from Methven, and two hours' drive from Christchurch.
Although Mount Potts is on private land, it has an easy access point from the Mount Somers road. The area is becoming more popular with tourists, after the filming of the "Lord Of The Rings" trilogy. Of special interest to these tourists, is the small hill in the centre of the plain, called Mount Sunday, which was the home of Edoras in the films. A recently added trek route has been put in so people can walk up to Mount Sunday and even climb it in relative safety.
Lord of the Rings Trilogy.
A fully realised set for Edoras was built on Mount Sunday, The production crew took nine months to build the set at the top of sheer cliffs, constructing Golden Hall and surrounding buildings at the top, with the gatehouse and more buildings at its foot. At the end of filming the set was dismantled and the area returned to its natural state. Although none of the actual set remains, the spectacular views of Mt Sunday sitting all alone in an expansive river plain surrounded by the Southern Alps still attracts hundreds of visitors each year.
History.
It was not until 1911 that Mt Potts became a station in its own right. Earlier, it was a part of Hakatere, the original run, which bordered the northern boundary of mt Possession and it took in lands between the Rangitta and Potts Rivers and extended north to the Ashburton River. For a period its western boundary extended as far as the Clyde and Lawrence rivers, to join Stronechrubie.
While land adjacent to the Rangitata, above the Potts River was first explored by Tripp and Acland, the majority of Hakatere country was explored by Thomas Potts, accompanied by F.G.P Leach and Henry Phillips Jnr.
Thomas Potts, a partner in the London gunsmiths, Brandon and Potts, emigrated to New Zealand at the age of 30, arriving in 1854. Later he married the daughter of Henry Phillips Snr, who was then the owner of Rockwood in the Hororata Valley. Potts invested capital in Rockwood and ran cattle there, although he and his wife lived at nearby Valehead. By 1857 these cattle numbered 250.
Previous expeditions up the Rakaia River to locate a desirable run for grazing his cattle has failed. In April 1857 however, he was determined to succeed in his quest for grazing rights. Along with his brother in law Henry Phillips, he made his was to the Snowdon Run where Francis Leach was in partnership with John Dudley. Potts, Phillips and Leach followed Rakaia, eventually reaching the mouth of Lake Stream.
The trio turned south, following Lake Stream and made camp at the mouth of Cameron River, leading into Lake Heron. They were fascinated with the white herons they saw on the stretch of water and it was Potts, an accomplished naturalist, that gave the lake its name.
Potts and Leach were impressed with the country around what is now known as Lake Clearwater, while Leach favoured the country around Lake Heron. In Christchurch both men lodged their respective claims of around 8,000 hectares. Francis Leach lodged his claim to the land near lake Heron, in the name of his partner Dudley and himself. This went on to become Clent Hills. Thomas Potts lodged his claim to his two blocks, however he refused to pay a deposit on his claim and instead, with young Henry Phillips, mustered as many cattle as possible from Rockwood and made for the Gorge with the intention of stocking the runs, thus preventing others from taking up his claim. HIs diary records that the pair crossed Rakaia, just below where Rakaia Gorge Bridge stands today. Pressing on, they finally turned their cattle on their new run on the 23 April 1857. In the shelter of spear grass and tall virgin tussock they erected a tent. Here on the Gorge’s most westerly run, Phillips was to spend some time tending to Potts’ cattle.
During the following three years Potts took up further land to the west and later added the Jumped Up Downs Run, a propert which had been owned first by Tripp and Acland and later by John Caton.
While he had a reputation as an expert stockman, particularly with cattle, Potts never actually lived on his run. Phillips from within the flaps of an ageing tent, managed the run for Potts until they eventually erected a homestead on the banks of Potts River.
In 1870 major changes were made on Hakatere, as it had become known. Cattle were moved of the run and replaced with sheep and short time later, the homestead was shifted form its site on the banks of Potts River to a new location near the Ashburton River.
Thomas Potts regularly visited the Gorge but lived at Governor’s Bay, leaving the management of Hakatere to Ferdinand Cradock and later Thomas Johnson. In 1883, the New Zealand Merchandise Company took over Hakatere from Thomas Potts, eleven years later in 1894, the Company added Mt Possession to its portfolio, taking the run over from Miles and Company Thomas Johnstone continued as manager of both runs until 1904, when he was succeeded by William Lambie.
During 1911, the leases for Hakatere came up for renewal. Divided into two parts, the run was put to a ballot. The part that faced Ashburton where the homestead and much of the freehold was located continued to be know as Hakatere. While the remaining half, lying between Potts and Rangitata Rivers was secured by the Johnstone family and renamed Mt Potts.
In 1924, the property was purchased by Cotty Burdon for $30,000 including stock. Cotty, who was to hold Mt Potts until 1939, had won a scholarship to Oxford University, studying for only a year before enlisting at the outbreak of the Great War. Returning to New Zealand he was advised that the future lay in the high country. Cotty has been described as an eccentric but vastly entertaining man, and storie s abound of both his wit and forgetfulness. At the conclusion of the school holidays, he offered to take his housekeeper’s daughter to Christchurch. Driving through the gate that she opened for him, Cotty proceeded to Christchurch and finally remembered his passenger when he reached his destination and discovered her luggage. On another occasion, he climbed to the top beat of the autumn muster before realising he had forgotten his dogs. Returning to the hut he ate a good amount of the food, left his fellow musterers to the task and proceeded to Timaru for a break.
Bruce Hay took over 7,200 sheep on his purchase in 1939 but decided not to winter his hoggets away reduced this to 6,000. Bruce and his wife Kathleen were married in 1940 and returned home by foot carrying their presents over the partially constructed Potts Bridge. Within a short time Bruce joined the N.Z. forces overseas, where he served with distinction. Throughout the war, Kath lived at Mt Potts employing managers to run the property.
In 1947 the property was sold and run with Mt Possession and Hakatere for a 10-year period. Early in this time many of the best river flats were washed away in a series of floods. Grazing estimated at around 1500 ewes was lost.
Arthur Urquhart from Erewhon bought the lease in 1957. At this point Mt Potts was regarded as an uneconomic unit required to be run with a neightbouring station.In 1964, he exchanged a freehold area at Erewhon for a speacian recreational lease of 70 acres and a skifield area at Mt Potts. Naming this Erewhon Prk he developed the skifield area and converted the original Mt Potts homestead, shearer’s quarters and woolshed into an accommodation and restaurant complex. The remainder of the station continued to be run with Erewhon. Within a short amount of time large numbers of people were coming into the area to enjoy its remotness and beauty.
A new homestead was added in 1973 and six years later, the Mt Potts and Erewhom leases were bought by Alisdair and Colin Urquhart in partnership although farmed separately. During this time, a new cottage, woolshed, cottage and many other farm buildings were added in 1991 the leasers were split into two properties again. Alisdair and Maxine, continued to run Mt Potts until the 9700 hectare property was sold to Mark Cotton from Otago in 1995, who then resold it to Mark Dewsbery in 1998. Dewsbery removed all the sheep and a large portion of the deer farmed and restocked with cattle. He also went through the Land Tenure Review Relinquishing most of the property to the Department of Conservation and retaining 1200 hectares of freehold land which is the Mt Potts Station of today. In 2011 Mt Potts was purchased by Alexandre Germanovitch.
Mt Potts is a station of contrasts. The bulk of productivity comes form the flats and rolling downs that sprawl along the Rangitata River. Much of the cultivated flats are now irrigated froma gravity fed spray system from the Potts River. Mt Sunday with its interesting geological origins, stands alone on the banks of the river and provides much of the safe wintering country for the ewes. Ring steeply from the road the property travels some 15 km back through high shingle basins to a point not far from where the Lawrence, Potts and Ashburton Rivers all Rise.

Frenching (automobile)

Frenching is the act of recessing or moulding a headlight, taillight, antenna or number plate into a car body to give a smoother look to the vehicle. The name originates from the end result looking like a French cuff of a shirt sleeve, which has a ridge at the end. Also known as tunnelling, it is a common modification used on leadsleds and customs since the 1930s. 
Frenching a headlight or taillight is done in one of two ways: either removing the bezel, mounting the light deeper in the car's head or taillight nacelle and using the headlight rings from another car (or an aftermarket kit) to mount it deeper into the body. Or it can be done by modifying the light's mountings so that they can be removed from behind, welding the bezel to the body once the chrome plating is removed and painting it body colour. This gives the effect of visually lengthening the car, as well as smoothing out the body. Many customs have lights from another car transplanted in place of the original factory items, but even these are frenched as well. 
This modification is seldom carried out on late models, as newer cars have flush-fitting headlights. This is a styling cue both influenced by customising and a means of improving the aerodynamics of the car.
Tunnelling.
This is done by cutting an area of sheet metal the shape of a number plate (for example), fabricating a box and welding it deeper into the body. The same principle is used in recessing car radio antennas, only that a hole must be drilled into the bottom of the tubing to let water drain out, reducing the risk of corrosion. This modification is still used on minitrucks, leadsleds and customized cars to this day.

Theresienstadt (film)

Theresienstadt. Ein Dokumentarfilm aus dem jüdischen Siedlungsgebiet () was a black-and-white projected Nazi propaganda film shot in the concentration camp of Theresienstadt.
In the summer of 1944, the Nazi government had perpetrated a hoax against the Danish Red Cross by taking them on a tour of the Theresienstadt concentration camp in the occupied Czech Republic. They "beautified" and cleaned the camp prior to arrival and arranged cultural activities to give the appearance of a happy, industrious community. To cover up the endemic overpopulation of the camp, numerous inmates were deported to Auschwitz before the arrival of the Red Cross delegation.
The gimmick was so successful that SS commander Hans Günther attempted to expand on it by having Kurt Gerron, a Jewish actor-director, make a short film about the camp to assure audiences that the inmates kept there were not being abused. In return, the Nazis promised that he would live. Shooting took 11 days, starting September 1, 1944.
Shortly after Gerron finished shooting the film, however, both he and other cast members were "evacuated" to Auschwitz, where they were gassed upon arrival. 
The film was intended to be shown in neutral countries to counter Allied news reports about the persecution of Jews. Influential organisations such as the International Red Cross and the Vatican would be given screenings. However, the progress of the war in late 1944 to early 1945 made that impossible. After an initial screening in early April 1945 to senior members of the government and SS, there were a few other screenings to international humanitarian groups in Theresienstadt in April 1945. Further distribution was halted by the defeat of Germany.
The film was mostly destroyed, but about 20 minutes of sequences from it have survived. The surviving footage features a children's opera, "Brundibar", and two musical performances on a wooden pavilion in the town square. One is of Karel Ančerl conducting a work by Pavel Haas, and the other is of the jazz band leader Martin Roman and his Ghetto Swingers. Ančerl and Roman both survived Auschwitz; most of their musicians and the children from the opera did not.
The "Beautification", the Red Cross tour, and the making of the film are dramatized extensively in the novel and mini-series "War and Remembrance". "Austerlitz", a novel by W.G. Sebald, features discussion of and a still from the film.

Peggy-Ann

Peggy-Ann is a musical comedy with music by Richard Rodgers, lyrics by Lorenz Hart and book by Herbert Fields, based on the 1910 musical "Tillie’s Nightmare" by Edgar Smith. 
Production.
The musical opened on Broadway at the Vanderbilt Theatre on December 27, 1926 and closed on October 29, 1927, after 333 performances. It was produced by Lew Fields (Herbert's father) and Lyle D. Andrews. Staged by Robert Milton, with musical staging by Seymour Felix, it starred Helen Ford as Peggy-Ann, Lester Cole, Lulu McConnell, and Betty Starbuck.
The musical opened in the West End at Daly's Theatre on July 29, 1927 and ran for 130 performances. Directed by Lew Fields, Dorothy Dickson starred as Peggy-Ann. 
The musical was considered daring for its time: there was no opening chorus and no songs for the first 15 minutes. The plot, told in one long dream, focuses on Peggy-Ann’s dream fantasies. She is the niece of the owner of a boarding house in New York and the fiancée of a local boy. She escapes from a hum-drum life through dreams of herself as a wealthy adventuress, with a yacht and a husband.
Critical response.
The "Time" review praised the "Gilbertian satire, Broadway slapstick, attractive dancers... the charm of the music." However, according to Merle Secrest, none of the songs "stood the test of time", except, possibly, "Where’s That Rainbow?". This may be why, according to Armond and L. Marc Fields, "Peggy-Ann" is not remembered as one of the outstanding musicals of the 1920s.
"The New York Times" reviewer wrote that the creators "have brought freshness and ideas to the musical-comedy field."

Salt Lake Masonic Temple

The Salt Lake Masonic Temple is the Masonic headquarters for Utah, and is Salt Lake City's best example of Egyptian Revival Architecture. It was completed in 1927, and is located in the South Temple Historic District of Salt Lake City, Utah.
General information.
The Salt Lake Masonic Temple consists of several Lodge rooms, greater and lesser Halls, numerous lounges, a banquet hall, an auditorium, a library and administrative offices. The Temple is currently home to the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Utah; six Salt Lake City Masonic Lodges (Wasatch Lodge No. 1, Mt. Moriah Lodge No. 2, Argenta Lodge No. 3, Acacia Lodge No. 17, Progress Lodge No. 22, and Kaibab Lodge No. 25); The Orient of Utah of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry; the Grand York Rite Bodies of Utah, and constituent Salt Lake York Rite Bodies; El Kalah Shrine; as well as the Grand Bodies for the ladies and youth organizations.
The building remains in continual use since it opened in 1927 and is maintained and operated by the Salt Lake Masonic Temple Association.
Usage.
The primary function of the building is the performance of the various rituals of the several Masonic organizations in Salt Lake City, and to provide a convenient location for administrative functions of the Utah Masonic family. The building is available for use by non-Masonic entities and persons.
History.
The decision to build the Salt Lake Masonic Temple took shape in the fall of 1920 as the Masonic population in Salt Lake City had out grown the existing Temple then located at the intersection of 2nd East and 1st South. The architect and Building Committee traveled to other cities reviewing existing Masonic Temples for favorable and unfavorable elements. Ultimately the committee resolved that the Salt Lake Masonic Temple be unique and not copied from existing Temples. By 1925 the plans had been completed, the land was purchased, and the interior furnishings arranged.
Much of the discussion preserved from the planning meetings centers on the amount of Masonic symbolism built into the Temple, and how it should be concealed, if at all.
Features.
The Salt Lake Masonic Temple has been considered Salt Lake’s best example of Egyptian Revival architecture. The Egyptian motif was chosen for several reasons: 1. the Egyptian style was the height of fashion at the time; 2. existing Temples largely followed elements of the classical orders of architecture, so the Egyptian motif would ensure a unique Masonic experience; and 3. it provided ample opportunity to incorporate Masonic symbols without disclosing their presences or disrupting the visual harmony of the edifice.
The exterior of the Temple is composed of "Temple Brick", a brick face specifically designed for the Salt Lake Masonic Temple, that subsequently became a popular decorative architectural element.
Light is perhaps the most significant symbol of Freemasonry, and the architect incorporated many Egypyian references to Light into the design of the Temple. Allusions to the Egyptian god Horus (then considered by Egyptologists to be a god of Light) occupy much of the building, including the cornice at the main entrance. There are three entrances to the Temple, alluding to the three Lights of a Masonic Lodge. The main entrance from the north of the building; as north is deemed a place of darkness in Masonic ritual, hence those coming through the front door are traveling toward light.
The funerary ramp located west of the main entrance is surmounted by a scarab, the Egyptian symbol of resurrection and immortality, and together with the seven acacia flanking the ramp allude to Masonic belief in a Supreme Being and the immortality of the soul.
The main entrance is approached by a staircase of three flights respectively consisting of three, five, seven and nine steps. The staircase is flanked by two sphinxes. Each sphinx holds a single sphere, one celestial, one terrestrial, and each is arranged to contemplate its sphere.

Lake Campotosto

Lake Campotosto (Italian: "Lago di Campotosto") is a man-made lake in the Abruzzo, Italy. The reservoir is located at an elevation of 1,313 m and comprises an area of 14 square kilometres. It is located in the natural park known as the "Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park".
The lake is reachable via the Italian State Highway 80 from either L'Aquila or the Adriatic Coast. Smaller roads lead to Capitignano, Montereale and Amatrice.
Description.
During the Quaternary Period of glacier formation, the Campotosto water basin had the form of a double "Y". Towards the end of this period, the Fucino River bed came into being. The upper portion of the artificial lake maintains the previously seen double "Y" formation that on the lower side is shaped more like a single "V".
The area where the lake now sits was once a vast peat bog, this used as an energy source by the local small industries up until the early 20th century. Lake Campotosto was created in the 1930s by means of constructing three dikes. The main reason for creating the lake was to establish a water reservoir that could be used to generate hydroelectric power in the Vomano valley.
During the construction of Lake Campotosto, a cableway leading to the Capitignano railway station was fortified. It was used to transport building materials and to carry earth away from the excavations. From Capitignano the rail line headed to L'Aquila following a course that had earlier been used for the transportation of peat. The rail line was abandoned soon after construction of the lake was completed.
During the winter the lake freezes completely over while in the fall many people come for a visit to admire the colorful foliage in the nearby forests.
Flora e fauna.
The "Lake Campotosto Reserve," located in the Province of L'Aquila in Abruzzo is a state owned wildlife preservation area. Local species include beech, willow, and snakewood trees. Indigenous to the area are badgers, pheasants, and foxes.
Lakeside attractions.
A circular trail about 50 km in length run along the perimeter of Lake Campotosto. It is rather flat in nature. In the summer it serves as a gathering place for many hiking, jogging, bicycle touring or simple romantic walks during the sunset hours. Shorter excursions can be arranged by cutting off one of the two main branches of the lake. A bridge, "Ponte delle Stecche" ("The Bridge of Sticks") has been built in one of the narrower sections of the lake. An older unused structure stands nearby. The traveler using this bridge is also able to greatly shorten his lakeside.
The neighboring Capannelle Pass, is located about 15 km away and also attracts many cyclists in the warmer months of the year.

Daeso

King Daeso (대소왕, 帶素王) (60 BC - 22 AD), (ruled 7 BC–22 AD) was the third ruler of the ancient Korean kingdom of Dongbuyeo.
Background.
King Daeso was the first son of the previous King Geumwa, and the grandson of Dongbuyeo’s founder and first ruler, Hae Buru.
Crown Prince of Dongbuyeo.
As Daeso was the first prince of Dongbuyeo, he was made Crown Prince by his father. Before this occurred, however, Jumong’s famed archery gave cause for tremendous jealousy and envy from Daeso and his six brothers. Jumong knew that his presence in Dongbuyeo would only be dangerous to himself, and decided to flee to Jolbon Buyeo. In the year 36 BC, In 37 BC, Jumong established Goguryeo, and King Geumwa died years later during 7 BC. Daeso rose to the throne and became King of Dongbuyeo.
King of Dongbuyeo.
War with Goguryeo.
Daeso gathered enough military power to attack Goguryeo. Before attacking, however, he sent an envoy to Goguryeo’s King Yuri, ordering him to send a royal hostage to Dongbuyeo. Goguryeo rejected the order and caused the first Goguryeo-Dongbuyeo war to occur in 6 AD. Daeso directly led a 50,000-man army into Goguryeo, but was forced to retreat when heavy snow began to fall. With this, Daeso would have to wait for seven years in order to regain what he had lost from the first war with Goguryeo. Then, in 13 AD, Daeso led his armies into Goguryeo once again. This time, Muhyul, a prince of Goguryeo, led the armies of Goguryeo in a well-planned ambush and slaughtered all of Daeso’s army. Only he and a few of his men escaped home. With these two failures, the economy of Dongbuyeo fell and chaos was inevitable.
Death.
After the death of Goguryeo’s King Yuri, the Crown Prince Muhyul rose to the throne to become King Daemusin. King Daemusin led an army and invaded Dongbuyeo, eventually killing Daeso, but he didn't destroy Dongbuyeo. The year was 21 AD, almost seven years after Daeso’s previous defeat.
After Daeso's death, the third son of King Geumwa rose to the throne and became King of Dongbuyeo.

Lee Yun-yeol

Lee Yun-Yeol (; born November 20, 1984), also known as '"NaDa", is a South Korean professional gamer who competitively played "StarCraft II" and before that, "". He is known for being one of the most accomplished "Brood War" players of all time with a total of six major title victories, including three KPGA tours in a row in 2002 and subsequently winning three OnGameNet StarLeagues over the following years, earning him the nickname, "Genius Terran". He achieved the highest KeSPA score of any player before it was re-scaled, and holds the record for longest stay in KeSPA's top 30 at 87 months, beginning in March 2002 and ending in May 2009. He has played for several top-ranking teams, including Pantech EX, Toona S.G., KT_MagicNs, Ideal Space and WeMade FOX. After his transition to "StarCraft II" in 2010, he joined the Korean team of Old Generations. In February 2012, he joined the American multi-gaming team, compLexity gaming. 
On June 19th, 2012, it was announced on compLexity's main site that Lee would be retiring from professional gaming, ending a career spanning over a decade.
Biography.
Lee first became known when he participated in an ITV game special where amateur players were pitted against professional players. Lee was the amateur and beat the player Chrh. Not long after, Lee made his debut as a pro gamer by winning three KPGA tours in three consecutive seasons all in a year's time. When the KPGA tour became the MBCGame StarCraft League, the KPGA tours were deemed equal to MSL wins, resulting in Lee being granted the golden badge, an award for winning three MSLs. Lee topped his KPGA Tour wins with a victory in the Panasonic OnGameNet Starleague. Afterwards Lee went into a slump; though he continued to be a strong player and came in second or first place in various leagues and tournaments, Lee did not win an MSL or OSL until the IOPS Ongamenet Starleague in 2004 or 2005. However, not long afterwards, Lee would enter the darkest period in his career. On 18 July 2005, FiFo reported that Lee's father had been killed in an automobile accident when an intoxicated driver performed an illegal U-turn and collided with his father's vehicle.
When Lee eventually returned to pro-gaming he began his return to the top. Lee's return became one of the most impressive comebacks in "Brood War" history, when in December 2007, Lee was once again the number one-ranked pro gamer in the KeSPA rankings. It had been a full two years and five months since he had stopped performing in July 2004. Lee's comeback culminated in his victory in the 2006 2nd ShinHan Bank OnGameNet StarLeague. In his winner's interview, Lee dedicated his victory to his father, saying "Yes, it is my first time winning the finals with my mother seated as the audience. But, for this very victory, I give it all to my father, though he didn't make it. From now on, I will do my best for my mother." This victory not only marked a successful comeback performance, but also was Lee's third OSL win, him becoming the first player in history to earn the OSL's Golden Mouse trophy and was Lee's sixth major title win, making him the then most accomplished "Brood War" player in the game's history.
In 2007, Lee signed a three-year contract with WeMade FOX for approximately 690,000 USD. After his contract with the organization expired in 2010, Lee announced his intentions to fully switch to "StarCraft II". Only after his retirement from "Brood War" was he equaled by Lee "Flash" Young-Ho for the most achievements in StarCraft: Broodwar. He joined the Korean team and gamer house of Old Generations and quickly became one of the strongest names in the "StarCraft II" scene, competing in the GOMTV Global StarCraft II League Season 2. There he advanced to the round of 8 before being defeated by Lim "BoxeR" Yo-Hwan. The following season Lee made it to round of 8 again, but was defeated by Lee "MarineKingPrime.WE" Jung-Hoon, losing 3 to 0. On July 15, 2011, SK Gaming announced a joint partnership with Old Generations, allowing for Lee and his teammate, Jang "MC" Min Chul, to be sponsored for international events on behalf of the organization. The partnership between Old Generations and SK Gaming ended on January 13, 2012, with Lee remaining with the former, while Jang remained with the latter until his contract expired at the end of January. On the 16th of February, Lee signed with American gaming team compLexity Gaming, wanting to participate in more StarCraft II events outside of Korea before leaving gaming to fulfill his mandatory South Korean Military service. 
It was announced that on November 20, 2011, Lee would be fulfilling his dream of becoming a CEO by opening up his own e-store, the NaDa Mall, which sells pro-gaming equipment.

<doc id="9798488" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9798488" title="Regional cuisines of medieval Europe">
Regional cuisines of medieval Europe

The regional cuisines of medieval Europe were the results of differences in climate, seasonal food variations, political administration and religious customs that varied across the continent. Though sweeping generalizations should be avoided, more or less distinct areas where certain foodstuffs dominated can be discerned. In the British Isles, northern France, the Low Countries, the northern German-speaking areas, Scandinavia and the Baltic the climate was generally too harsh for the cultivation of grapes and olives. In the south, wine was the common drink for both rich and poor alike (though the commoner usually had to settle for cheap second pressing wine) while beer was the commoner's drink in the north and wine an expensive import. Citrus fruits (though not the kinds most common today) and pomegranates were common around in the Mediterranean. Dried figs and dates occurred quite frequently in the north, but were used rather sparingly in cooking.
Olive oil was among the ubiquitous ingredients around the Mediterranean, but remained an expensive import in the north where oil of poppy, walnut, hazel and filbert was the most affordable alternative. Butter and lard, especially after the terrible blood-letting of the population during the Black Death, was used in considerable quantities in the northern and northwestern regions, especially in the Low Countries. Almost universal in middle and upper class cooking all over Europe was the almond, which was in the ubiquitous and highly versatile almond milk, which was used as a substitute in dishes that otherwise required eggs or milk, though the bitter variety came along much later.
Central Europe.
Germany.
At no time during the Middle Ages was there a completely unified state that incorporated all or even a majority of all German-speaking peoples. The map was dotted with minor kingdoms, free cities and, in the High and Late Middle Ages, the ports controlled by the Hanseatic League, a powerful trading alliance. Most of these were under the loosely defined suzerainty of the Holy Roman Empire. Here the definition of "Germany" is the lands where High and Low German was spoken, which extended roughly from Alsace in the west to Silesia in the east and from the Tyrol in the south to the Baltic Sea coast in the north.
Though various forms of dishes consisting of batter or dough cooked in fat, like crêpes, fritters and doughnuts were common in most of Europe, they were especially popular among Germans and known as "krapfen" (Old High German: "claw, hook") and were quite similar to the deep fried dough pastries of today. The extensive use of lard and butter for cooking and a diet that was perceived as especially fatty gained Germans a reputation as being the "fat Germans". The fasting regulations of the Catholic Church posed particular problems to the German population. Olives could not be cultivated and olive oil was an expensive import. Oils made from various nut were available, but in relatively short supply. By far, the most common sources of fat were butter and, above all, lard. The price of fish was generally higher, and while it was unaffordable to most people for most of the time, the need to use fish for fasting days could mean considerable increases in expenses for the wealthier households. Mustard was used in other parts of Europe long before the Middle Ages, but seemed to be especially common in Germany. A 14th-century travel account by Eustache Deschamps, a French poet, shows his considerable discontent with the German custom of smearing generous amounts of mustard on just about every type of meat.
It was rare that recipes for use in dire situations were included in recipe collections, but one example from a cookbook in Low German has been preserved. It gives instructions for a wartime stew consisting of any available greens and vegetables to be boiled in animal stomachs or intestines, an effective method in situations where no proper kitchenware would be available. In the First Margrave War, the city of Nuremberg was able to feed its citizens properly and still emerge victorious through careful planning, extensive stockpiling of grain and meat and strict control of prices by the town council.
Poland.
The most common grains in Poland were millet (often made into "kasza", a type of porridge) and wheat. Barley and oats were cultivated, but used mostly as animal feed or for brewing beer. Cabbage (especially as sauerkraut), kale, peas, broad beans, and onions were the most common vegetables. Dill and mustard were almost ubiquitous potherbs and parsley was used as a leafy green in stews, as a flavor additive, and applied as a coloring agent in dishes for the upper classes. Beef, pork and poultry (primarily chicken) were the most common meats, with the occasional appearance of mutton and lamb. Game, as elsewhere, was highly prized, but in short supply and usually limited to the high nobility, as hunting licenses were controlled by land owners. Fish was a staple, but unlike Germans, Poles tended only to eat it on fast days when meat was forbidden by the church.
Beer was drunk by all social classes, and came in many different varieties and made from millet, wheat, barley, rye or oats sometimes in combination. Wheat beer was the most common. Labrador tea, a mildly toxic herb, was often used as an ingredient to increase intoxication. It was mixed with hops and then added to a barley and wheat beer to produce what was called "thick beer". Though often believed to be a common Slavic drink, mead was fairly expensive and primarily enjoyed at weddings and baptismal parties, though always overshadowed by the ever-present beer. It had a high standing as a ceremonial drink and used when arranging alliances and closing contracts. Wine was generally quite expensive and was enjoyed mostly by the nobility. Although there is evidence of a few vineyards in Poland, almost all wine had to be imported.
A large variety of breads, like "obwarzanki" were sold by vendors in Krakow as early as the 14th century and "placki", flat cakes, came in a surprising number of varieties, including one variety with an apple topping, reminiscent of pizza. German bakers operating in Polish towns had much influence. "Krepels" (from German "Krapfen", "claw; hook") were fried pastries with a cheese filling served with strawberries or other fruit, and resembled a modern empanada.
Northern Europe.
Britain.
Relatively little is known about the eating habits of the Anglo-Saxons of the Early and High Middle Ages before the Norman conquest in 1066. Ale was the drink of choice of both commoners and nobles, and the known dishes included various stews, simple broths, and soups. The level of refinement was low, and international influence fairly insignificant. This all changed in the 11th century after the Norman invasion. With the invaders came a new and less provincial gentry, and new eating habits, especially for the nobility. While traditional British cooking today is not regarded with high esteem internationally, the Medieval Anglo-Norman cooks were considerably more refined and more cosmopolitan. It has previously been believed that the Anglo-Norman cuisine was mostly similar to that of France, but recent study has shown that many recipes had unique English traits. This was based partly on the different available foodstuffs on the British Isles, but more due to influence from Arab cuisine through the Norman conquest of Sicily. The Arab invaders in the 9th century had cultivated their lifestyle culturally and economically to such a degree that the Norman invaders inherited and adapted many of their habits, including cooking styles. Norman participation in the crusades also brought them into contact with Middle Eastern and Byzantine cooking.
The "subtlety" (or entremet), the fanciful and highly decorative surprise dish used to separate one course from another, was brought to new levels of complexity and refinement by the English chefs. Among the specialties were "pommes dorées" ("gilded apples"), meatballs of mutton or chicken colored with saffron or a glaze of egg yolk. The Anglo-Norman variant, "pommes d'orange", were flavored and coloured with the juice of bitter oranges.
Scandinavia.
The climate in the far north of Europe made cultivation of cereals even more difficult, and the wheat so popular in the south was a luxury. Wheat could cost at least twice as much as the most common grains, barley and rye. Barley was the most widely grown, but a great percentage of the harvest went into the extensive beer production, while rye was the principal bread grain. Like in the rest of Europe, oats was considered only fit as animal fodder and was only eaten when no other choice was available, and then usually as porridge or gruel. Though grains were in the highest regard among medieval Scandinavians and were among the most frequently mentioned foods, other vegetable foods were an indispensable part of the diet: peas, turnips, beans, carrots, onions, leeks and various greens and herbs all provided essential nutrients and vitamins. Kale, a form of cabbage, was especially important in Denmark and Sweden and was a valuable source of fresh food in the winter months, since it kept well and could be harvested (and even tasted better) after the first frost had set in.
Fish was of great importance to most of Scandinavia, and particularly so was the herring fishing in the Limfjord and Oresund. The great shoals of herring migrating from the Atlantic into the Baltic to feed were funnelled through certain narrow points and were caught in huge numbers. The amount of fish caught was more than enough to feed the local population and allowed for huge exports of smoked, and especially salted, fish. Great herring markets were organized in southern Scandinavia, most notably at Skanör in Scania, which was in the Middle Ages part of Denmark. From this market alone, merchant vessels of the Hanseatic League, the powerful medieval confederation of northern German cities, exported upwards of over 100,000 barrels of salted herring during many decades of the Late Middle Ages. Of equal, or even greater importance was cod, often fished on the North Sea and Atlantic, dried to make stockfish, and imported as an important staple, particularly during fast and Lent. Many freshwater fish were also of great dietary or economic importance, such as salmon, eel, pike and bream.
Cattle rearing was very widespread in Scandinavia, especially Denmark, where the Black Death had left huge field areas untended and well-suited for grazing. The majority of meat produced was consumed by the local population, but an export market for high-grade beef slowly built up after the 1360s, and had by the 17th century reached well over 100,000 animals per year. All this cattle meant not just meat, but also great quantities of dairy products, which consisted mostly of soured milk drinks, various cheeses and, also a major export product, butter.
Northern France.
Northern French cuisine had many similarities to the Anglo-Norman French across the channel, but also had its own specialties. Typical of the Northern French kitchen were the potages and broths, and French chefs excelled in the preparation of meat, fish, roasts, and the sauces that were considered appropriate to each dish. The use of dough and pastry, which was fairly popular in Britain at the time, was almost completely absent from recipe collections with the exception of a few pies. Nor were there any forms of dumplings or the fritters that were so popular in Central Europe. A common Northern French habit was to name dishes after famous and often exotic places and people.
A specialty among finer French chefs was the preparation of so-called parti-colored dishes. These mimicked the late medieval fashion of wearing clothing with two colors contrasting one another on either side of the garment, a fashion that survived in the costumes of court jesters. The common Western European "white dish" ("blanc manger") had a northern French variant where one side was colored bright red or blue. Another recipe in "Du fait de cuisine" from 1420 described an "entremet" consisting of a roasted boar's head with one half colored green and the other golden yellow.
Western Mediterranean.
Roman influence on the entire Mediterranean region was so considerable that to this day, the basic food in most of the region is still wheat bread, olives, olive oil, wine, cheese, and the occasional piece of meat or fish. The territories from the Atlantic to the Italian Peninsula, and especially the Catalan and Occitan-speaking areas were closely interrelated culturally and politically. The Muslim conquest of Sicily and southern Spain was highly influential on the cuisine by introducing new plants like lemons, pomegranates, eggplants and spices such as saffron. The coloring of food and many other cooking techniques were passed on by the Arab invaders to their European possessions and were gradually spread to regions further north.
Iberia.
The Iberian Peninsula has a highly varied geography with a central Meseta, a vast, flat plateau, surrounded on all sides by mountain ranges and cut off from the rest of Europe by the Pyrenees. This meant that several distinct cultures co-existed on the peninsula with several unique cuisines. Since Ancient times it had been a colony of several Mediterranean cultures. The Phoenicians introduced the cultivation of olives and the Greeks brought the Malvasia grape, founding a wine industry that would become renowned in the Middle Ages. But it was the Roman Empire, of which the peninsula was the westernmost outpost, that had the biggest impact on Iberian cuisine. After the collapse of Roman rule, Visigothic invaders conquered most of the modern day Spain and Portugal in the 5th century. The Visigoths took on many Roman customs, like the focus on vegetables, and used Latin for official purposes. But it was the invasions of North African Muslims and the establishment of Al-Andalus that gave Iberian cuisine its unique nature. The Muslims brought with them the highly refined cuisine influenced by Arab courts in the Middle East. The center of this Arab civilization was Baghdad, at the time one of the largest cities in the world. The new rulers introduced many new customs and foodstuffs; goblets made of glass rather than metal, savory meat dishes cooked with fruit, spices and herbs like cinnamon, mastic, caraway, sesame and mint and the use of ground almonds or rice as thickeners and a fondness for adding tangy liquids like verjuice, tamarind and the juice of bitter oranges to produce a distinctly sweet-sour taste. The impact can clearly be seen in the multitude of Arab loanwords in Spanish; "naranja" "orange", "azúcar" ("sugar"), "alcachofa" ("artichoke"), "azafrán" ("saffron") and "espinaca" ("spinach"), many of which eventually spread to other languages in Europe. The Spanish Muslims established the sequences of dishes which was to permeate the entire continent and which is still forms the basis for many modern European meals; soup followed by meat dishes and finished off with sweets. It also believed that escabeche, a vinegar-based dish, could very well be of Arab-Persian origin, though this has been contested.
One of the earliest medieval cookbooks in a language other than Latin was "Libre de Sent Soví" ("The Book of Saint Sophia"), written in Catalan around 1324. A majority of its recipes call for bitter oranges, rose water and cider to achieve the popular tangy flavor of late medieval cuisine. It contains many fish recipes, but surprisingly enough, no mention of shellfish, which must have been one of the major food sources in the Catalan coastal regions. The highly influential "Libre del Coch", in Catalan as well, was published in a printed edition in 1520, but is assumed to have been written no later than 1490. The typical medieval white dish ("manjar blanco") seems to have appeared first in Catalonia in the 8th century and eventually evolved into a type of sweet pudding. While poorly represented in cookbooks, the most common food for the general population, other than the regular staples of bread, wine, garlic, onion and olive oil, included eggs, lamb, beef, kid and bacon.
The Jewish population of Al-Andalus, the Sephardic Jews, developed their cuisine in close contact with Christians and Muslims. Influences went in both directions and lasted even after the expulsions and forced conversions of the Jewish population that followed the Reconquista. Among the specialties was "adafina" (from Arabic "al dafina" "the buried treasure"), a meat dish that was prepared by burying it in hot coals on the day before the Shabbat. Jewish fish pie dishes have survived in Spanish cuisine as "empanadas de pescado".
Italy.
The lucrative Mediterrenean trade in spices, silk and other luxuries from Africa and Asia were shipped on the galleys of the powerful city-states of Genoa, Venice and Florence, making them phenomenally rich. Medieval Italy, meaning primarily the northern Italian Peninsula, was one of the few regions in medieval Europe where the distinction between nobility and prosperous commoners were more or less irrelevant, the result of a significant, rich and self-conscious middle class. This meant that the level of culinary refinement and diversity was especially great when compared to the rest of the continent. Italian cuisine was, and still is, better described as a multitude of highly varied regional cuisines, each with long traditions and their own specialties. Italian dishes can therefore be considered either traditional or imported. Being the hub of a vast trade network meant that there was greater access to foreign luxuries to influence the local cooking. Still, there was a great deal of conservatism and in general far more of local Italian foodstuffs were exported to the New World than the other way around, though the impact of important products such as vanilla, corn, kidney beans, and of course, the tomato, which had a considerable impact on the cooking south of Naples, even if this transition took some time.
Many Italian staples and internationally recognized favorites were invented and refined during the Late Middle Ages and the early Renaissance; pasta was on everyone's dinner plate by the 13th century, though it was commonly made out of rice flour rather than durum wheat; pizza, the medieval Italian term for "pie", and tortes came in many varieties with a wide range of toppings, ranging from marzipan, and custards to chicken, eel, or even hemp; polenta made from French green lentils or barley; risotto; and a myriad of local or regional variants of sausage and cheese which was eaten by more or less everyone. As early as the Middle Ages, the cheeses, in particular, appear to have been highly specialized, from a fresh Tuscan to an aged Milanese from Tadesca, wrapped and shipped in tree bark. Medieval Italians also used eggs to a higher degree than many other regions, and the recipe collections describe herb omelettes ("herboletos") and frittatas. Grapes as tasty morsels and lemons as a cooking ingredient was ubiquitous and, of course, olive oil of every conceivable kind was the cooking fat of choice in all regions, including the north, for dressing salads, frying, seasoning, marinading and preserving meats.
Southern France.
The cuisine of southern France, corresponding roughly to the extent of Occitania, had far more in common with Italian and Catalan cooking than with northern French cuisine. Ingredients that distinguished southern cooking included sugar, walnut oil, chickpeas, pomegranates and lemons, all of which were grown locally. While pomegranate seeds were occasionally used to decorate dishes in France and England, flavoring dishes with pomegranate juice was a practice unique to the Occitan areas. The use of butter and lard was rare, salted meat for frying was common, and the preferred methods of cooking tended to be dry roasting, frying, or baking. For the latter, a "trapa", a portable oven that was filled with food and buried in hot ashes, was often used. 
Dishes still common today, like "escabeche", a vinegar-based dish, and "aillade" (aioli), a garlic sauce (still made in Toulouse with walnut oil), were well-established in the Late Middle Ages. Evidence of influence from Muslim Spain can be found in recipes for "matafeam", a Christian version of the originally Hispano-Jewish Shabbat stew "adafina", but with pork rather than lamb. And, "Raymonia" (Occitan; Ital: "Romania") is based on the Arabic "Rummaniya", a chicken bruet with pomegranate juice, ground almonds, and sugar. Only one recipe collection is positively identified as being from southern France. The "Modus viaticorum preparandorum et salsarum" is a collection of 51 recipes. It was written ca. 1380-90 in Latin with occasional words in Occitan. The "Modus" contains a "Salsa de cerpol" (Wild thyme sauce) and a "Cofiment anguille" (Confit of eel), which appear nowhere else but in Occitania.
A cookery book from northern Europe may have originated in Provence. Known from its "incipit" as "Libellus de arte coquinaria", it is the Codex K version of the Harpestraeng Cookbook, which is part of a collection of medical papers written by, or belonging to, Dr. Henrik Harpestraeng. It is currently housed in the Royal Library of Copenhagen (Ny samling Nr. 66, 8 vo.). Food historian Dr. Rudolf Grewe proposed a NW Mediterranean origin for this book based on the recipes and their ingredients, such as saffron. Since Harpestraeng studied medicine in Provence, probably at Montpellier, he may have obtained the book during that time. Harpestraeng may have brought the book to Denmark, where he was the physician to King Valdemar II. Codex K is believed to have been copied into Danish from an earlier Low German original, or copy. This would have happened before 1244, the year Harpestraeng died. If so, "Libellus de arte coquinaria" is the earliest Western European cookery book, since Apicius' De re coquinaria. 
Some dietary details have been extrapolated from Vatican archives from 1305–78 when Avignon was the seat of the Avignon Papacy. Though the lifestyles of the papal courts could often be very luxurious, the Vatican account books of the daily alms given to the poor describe some of what lower class food in the region was like. The food that was handed out to the needing consisted mainly of bread, legumes, and some wine. These were occasionally supplemented with cheese, fish, olive oil and meat of low quality. 
Montpellier, located on in Languedoc only a few miles from the coast, was a major center for trade, education in medicine, and was famous for its "espices de chamber" or "parlor confections", a term for sweets such as candied aniseed and ginger. The confectionery from the town was so renowned that its market value was twice as high as that of similar products from other towns. Montpellier was also well known for its spices and the wines with which they were flavored, like the ubiquitous hypocras.
Byzantine Empire.
The culinary traditions of Roman times lived on in the Byzantine empire. Inherited from Greek traditions was the use of olives and olive oil, wheat bread, and plenty of fish. These would very often be served or prepared with "garós", the Greek term for garum, a sauce made out of fermented fish that was so popular that it more or less replaced salt as the common food flavoring. The Byzantine kitchen was also influenced by Arab cuisine from which it imported the use of eggplants and oranges. Seafood was very popular and included tuna, lobster, mussels, oysters, murena, and carp. Around the 11th century the habit of eating roe and caviar was also imported from the Black Sea region. Dairy products were consumed in the form of cheese (particularly feta), and nuts and fruits such as dates, figs, grapes, pomegranates, and apples. The choice of meats were lamb, and several wild animals like gazelles, wild asses, and suckling young in general. Meat was often salted, smoked or dried. Wine was popular, like elsewhere around the Mediterranean, and it was the drink of choice among the higher social classes, where sweet wines like Muscat or Madeira/Malmsey were popular. Among the lower classes, the common drink tended to be vinegar mixed with water. Like all Christian societies the Byzantines had to abide by the dietary restrictions of the church, which meant avoiding meats (and preferably general excesses) on Wednesdays and Fridays and during fast and Lent.
The Byzantine empire also became quite famous for its desserts, which included biscuits, rice pudding, quince marmalade, rose sugar and many types of non-alcoholic beverages. The most common sweetener was honey, with sugar extracted from sugar cane being reserved for those who could afford it.
The food of the lower classes was mostly vegetarian and limited to olives, fruit, onions, and the occasional piece of cheese, or stews made from cabbage and salted pork. The standard meal of a shoemaker was described in a Byzantine poem, one of the "Prodromic Poems", as consisting of some cooked foods and an omelette followed by hot salted pork with an unspecified garlic dish.

Tales of Terror (band)

Tales of Terror was a Sacramento hardcore punk band which was active from 1982 until 1986. Some, including Kurt Cobain and Mark Arm, cite Tales of Terror as a key inspiration for the then-burgeoning grunge scene.
History.
Tales of Terror was formed in 1982 by singer Pat Stratford and bassit Geoff Magner, formerly of the punk band Square Cools. They were later joined by guitarists Lyon Wong and drummer Mike Hunter
By 1984 they were playing all over town and supporting big name punk acts like The Vandals, Dead Kennedys, and Fang.
Their one album, the self-titled effort "Tales of Terror", was released in 1984 on the San Francisco indie label, CD Presents. Distribution was limited; it is estimated that less than 5000 copies were pressed
However, the band's career came to an end on the night of January 5, 1986. Wong, the son of Chinese-American actor Victor Wong, died on a Midtown sidewalk of head trauma he suffered after being knocked to the curb during a late-night altercation. He was pronounced dead at 2:14 am, January 6, at Sutter General Hospital. Wong was 22 years old. The assailant received a 6-month sentence for manslaughter. The band opted not to continue without Lyon Wong. The various members drifted into other groups, most notably the Pirates of Venus, the Cactus Liquors and the Whorelords.
Legacy.
Described by "Midtown Monthly" as "One of the most influential bands Sacramento ever produced" and often cited as the foundation of the grunge movement, their blend of hardcore, psychedelia, and rock had a lasting impact on music fans around the country, including Green River and Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. In "Exclaim!" magazine Mudhoney’s Mark Arm (whose earlier band Green River covered Tales' "Ozzy" on their 1987 "Dry As a Bone" EP) listed some of their gigs as the most inspirational he had seen. Dave Chavez of Verbal Abuse said, "With the right management and maybe a little bit of rehab here and there, Tales of Terror probably would have been the Nirvana and broke. If it wasn’t for the murder of Lyon Wong."

Gottlieb 300 pinball, Gottlieb Top Score pinball—same game, just different number of players (4 players versus 2 players). Gottlieb sold this game design in the two varieties, though they are essentially exactly the same game (with slight artwork differences). The 2 player version (Top Score) had a lower price than the 4 player (300), and was marketed to game operators with less money to spend. This game used animated backbox red (bowling) balls for the bonus unit. Two kickout holes, 2 pop bumpers, 1 spinner, 2 slingshots, two 3" flippers. Has the same right side lane scoring as Gottlieb Sheriff pinball (1971), and similar left side score as Gottlieb Super Soccer. Only a couple Gottlieb pinball games made during the 1970s used backbox animation. Same backbox animation unit as Super Soccer pinball. They made 7925 Gottlieb 300 pinball machines, and 3200 Gottlieb Top Score pinball machines.

Betty Ridley

Dame Mildred Betty Ridley DBE (10 September 1909 – 1 August 2005) was a leading figure in the life of the Church of England from the 1960s into the 1980s, serving as Third Church Estates Commissioner from 1972 until 1981, the first woman to hold the post.
Early life.
Ridley was the daughter of Rev. Henry Mosley and his wife Mildred Willis. Her father, was then Rector of Poplar, London. He was in 1919 appointed Bishop of Stepney and, in 1928 Bishop of Southwell. She was educated at the independent North London Collegiate School and at Cheltenham Ladies' College. She married Michael Ridley, her father's chaplain at the age of 19. Michael Ridley became incumbent of parishes in Pimlico and Finchley. He died at an early age in 1953, leaving his widow with four children. As a widow Ridley recognised periodic bereavements as a fact of life. Her only brother had been killed on the last day of the battle of El Alamein. Her experience as a mother, a bishop's daughter and a parson's wife soon found various new outlets.
Women in the church.
Ridley believed that women should be accepted as candidates for Holy Orders. (Her father was at one time chairman of a central Council for Women's Church Work). She took many opportunities to forward this cause. Before her husband died, she was elected to the Anglican Church Assembly and joined the Council for Woman's Work. She played a major part in settling the structures of the Assembly's successor body, the General Synod. For the ten years of its existence, she was at the heart of the new Synod. She served for 25 years on the Central Board of Finance and she was a member "the first woman to be appointed" of the Advisory Council for the Training of the Ministry. In 1979, she was a founding member of the Movement for the Ordination of Women. In 1982, she chaired the Crown Appointments Commission that led to the appointment of John Habgood as Archbishop of York.
From 1959 to 1981 she was a Church Commissioner, and active on various committees. In 1972, Archbishop Michael Ramsey appointed her to succeed Sir Hubert Ashton as Third Church Estates Commissioner, the first woman to hold the post, which she held until 1981.
Other interests.
Ridley was a member of The Bach Choir for most of her adult life and sang under Reginald Jacques and David Willcocks. She also took part in the television programme "Evensong", shown in the BBC's "Everyman" series in December 1992.

<doc id="9798607" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9798607" title="Sporogenesis">
Sporogenesis

Sporogenesis is the production of spores in biology. The term is also used to refer to the process of reproduction via spores. Reproductive spores were found to be formed in eukaryotic organisms, such as plants, algae and fungi, during their normal reproductive life cycle. Dormant spores are formed, for example by certain fungi and algae, primarily in response to unfavorable growing conditions. Most eukaryotic spores are haploid and form through cell division, though some types are diploid or dikaryons and form through cell fusion.
Reproduction via spores.
Reproductive spores are generally the result of cell division, most commonly meiosis (e.g. in plant sporophytes). Sporic meiosis is needed to complete the sexual life cycle of the organisms using it.
In some cases, sporogenesis occurs via mitosis (e.g. in some fungi and algae). Mitotic sporogenesis is a form of asexual reproduction. Examples are the conidial fungi "Aspergillus" and "Penicillium", for which mitospore formation appears to be the primary mode of reproduction. Other fungi, such as ascomycetes, utilize both mitotic and meiotic spores. The red alga "Polysiphonia" alternates between mitotic and meiotic sporogenesis and both processes are required to complete its complex reproductive life cycle.
In the case of dormant spores in eukaryotes, sporogenesis often occurs as a result of fertilization or karyogamy forming a diploid spore equivalent to a zygote. Therefore, zygospores are the result of sexual reproduction.
Reproduction via spores involves the spreading of the spores by water or air. Algae and some fungi (chytrids) often use motile zoospores that can swim to new locations before developing into sessile organisms. Airborne spores are obvious in fungi, for example when they are released from puffballs. Other fungi have more active spore dispersal mechanisms. For example, the fungus "Pilobolus" can shoot its sporangia towards light. Plant spores designed for dispersal are also referred to as diaspores. Plant spores are most obvious in the reproduction of ferns and mosses. However, they also exist in flowering plants where they develop hidden inside the flower. For example, the pollen grains of flowering plants develop out of microspores produced in the anthers.
Reproductive spores grow into multicellular haploid individuals or sporelings. In heterosporous organisms, two types of spores exist: microspores give rise to males and megaspores to females. In homosporous organisms, all spores look alike and grow into individuals carrying reproductive parts of both genders.
Formation of reproductive spores.
Sporogenesis occurs in reproductive structures termed sporangia. The process involves sporogenous cells (sporocytes, also called spore mother cells) undergoing cell division to give rise to spores.
Meiospore formation.
In meiotic sporogenesis, a diploid spore mother cell within the sporangium undergoes meiosis, producing a tetrad of haploid spores. In organisms that are heterosporous, two types of spores occur: Microsporangia produce male microspores, and megasporangia produce female megaspores. In megasporogenesis, often three of the four spores degenerate after meiosis, whereas in microsporogenesis all four microspores survive.
In gymnosperms, such as conifers, microspores are produced through meiosis from microsporocytes in microstrobili or male cones. In flowering plants, microspores are produced in the anthers of flowers. Each anther contains four pollen sacs, which contain the microsporocytes. After meiosis, each microspore undergoes mitotic cell division, giving rise to multicellular pollen grains (six nuclei in gymnosperms, three nuclei in flowering plants).
Megasporogenesis occurs in megastrobili in conifers (for example a pine cone) and inside the ovule in the flowers of flowering plants. A megasporocyte inside a megasporangium or ovule undergoes meiosis, producing four megaspores. Only one is a functional megaspore whereas the others stay dysfunctional or degenerate. The megaspore undergoes several mitotic divisions to develop into a female gametophyte (for example the seven-cell/eight-nuclei embryo sac in flowering plants).
Mitospore formation.
Some fungi and algae produce mitospores through mitotic cell division within a sporangium. In fungi, such mitospores are referred to as conidia.
Formation of dormant spores.
Some algae, fungi and bacteria form resting spores made to survive unfavorable conditions. Typically, changes in the environment from favorable to unfavorable growing conditions will trigger a switch from asexual reproduction to sexual reproduction in these organisms. The resulting spores are protected through the formation of a thick cell wall and can withstand harsh conditions such as drought or extreme temperatures. Examples are chlamydospores, teliospores, zygospores, and myxospores.
Chlamydospore and teliospore formation.
Chlamydospores are generally multicellular, asexual structures. Teliospores are a form of chlamydospore produced through the fusion of cells or hyphae where the nuclei of the fused cells stay separate. These nuclei undergo karyogamy and meiosis upon germination of the spore.
Zygospore, oospore and auxospore formation.
Zygospores are formed in certain fungi (zygomycota, for example "Rhizopus") and some algae (for example "Chlamydomonas"). The zygospore forms through the isogamic fusion of two cells (motile single cells in "Chlamydomonas") or sexual conjugation between two hyphae (in zygomycota). Plasmogamy is followed by karyogamy, therefore zygospores are diploid (zygotes). They will undergo zygotic meiosis upon germinating.
In oomycetes, the zygote forms through the fertilization of an egg cell with a sperm nucleus and enters a resting stage as a diploid, thick-walled oospore. The germinating oospore undergoes mitosis and gives rise to diploid hyphae which reproduce asexually via mitotic zoospores as long as conditions are favorable.
In diatoms, fertilization gives rise to a zygote termed auxospore. Besides sexual reproduction and as a resting stage, the function of an auxospore is the restoration of the original cell size, as diatoms get progressively smaller during mitotic cell division. Auxospores divide by mitosis.
Endospore formation.
The term sporogenesis can also refer to endospore formation in bacteria, which allows the cells to survive unfavorable conditions. Endospores are not reproductive structures and their formation does not require cell fusion or division. Instead, they form through the production of an encapsulating spore coat within the spore-forming cell.

St John's Church, Bath

St. John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church is located on the South Parade in the south-east section of Bath City Centre – the old Ham District where John Wood the Elder, the Georgian architect, had originally planned his gigantic "Forum".
Architecture.
The decorative Gothic-styled spire dominates the city's skyline, which has irked some people such as noted architectural critic Nikolaus Pevsner who accuses the church of being "a demonstrative proof of how intensely the Gothicists hated the Georgians of Bath." Christopher Martin takes a more measured view in his work on English Catholic churches, commenting "the stately interior is a good reflection of mid-Victorian taste", and remarking on the colourful polished marble, the exquisite screen, the blazing and triumphant white tabernacle, the delicate communion rails, a series of references to St John, and the chapels, each with something to admire. 
The structure was designed and built between 1861-3 by Charles Francis Hansom, who was the brother of J. A. Hansom, the creator of the Hansom cab, and had formerly done the village church at Hanley Swan. The brothers also prepared designs for Woodchester Mansion in Nympsfield, Gloucestershire, after A. W. N. Pugin had resigned from the project. For this reason, they are often quoted as being the second best Roman Catholic architects of their day, for their success in picking up commissions Pugin had passed over. Woodchester Mansion's north service wing was also designed by them in the same Gothic style. 
The walls are of Bath stone. The church's 222 foot (68 metre) spire was added by Hansom in 1867. The baptistery, a shrine containing the relics of Saint Justina of Padua, was designed by Edward Joseph Hansom, his son, in 1871. 
The brothers considered the church to be one of their best works. Pevsner's typical terse description describes the church as follows:
History.
The church was put up by the Benedictines based at Downside Abbey, which accounts for the substantial ancillary buildings intended to accommodate a small community of priests. It was handed over to the Diocese of Clifton in 1932. 
The building was bombed in 1942: four people died and the south aisle was destroyed, but subsequently rebuilt in a similar Gothic style. The inscription commemorating this event is in Latin: ""Hostili incursione diruta..."".
Parish.
The parish lies within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Clifton, and is one of four within the City of Bath. There are currently three priests, one a Pole who celebrates Mass in his own tongue each Sunday for the local Polish community. The parish priest, Fr. David Ryan, became a Canon of Clifton diocese in 2013.

Lewis R. Fiske

Lewis Ransom Fiske (December 24, 1825 – February 14, 1901) was an educator from the U.S. state of Michigan. He served as president "pro tempore" of the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan (now Michigan State University) from 1859 to 1862 and as president of Albion College from 1877 to 1898. Fiske sometimes spelled his name Fisk.
Biography.
Lewis Ransom Fiske was born in Penfield, New York, the sixth child of ten born to James and Eleanor (née Ransom) Fiske. The ancestors of the Fiske family left England to settle in Wenham, Massachusetts, in 1637. Lewis' father, James Fiske, was born in New Hampshire, August 4, 1788, and was a cousin to Levi Woodbury, a prominent politician from New Hampshire who served as a justice of the United States Supreme Court. 
The family moved to a farm in Coldwater, Michigan, in 1835. In the school year 1845–46, Fiske attended the Wesleyan Seminary of Albion (now Albion College). He went on to graduate in 1850 with an A.B. from the University of Michigan. He began to study law, but in the fall of 1850 accepted a position as professor of Natural Science at the Albion Female Collegiate Institute and Wesleyan Seminary. 
On September 19, 1852, Fiske married Elizabeth Ross Spence (d. February 25, 1879). Spence was the cousin of Scottish author and poet George MacDonald. In the summer of 1880 Fiske married Helen M. Davis of Detroit (d. 1896). Fiske had one daughter and one son with his first wife and three sons with the second. 
In 1853, Fiske received an A.M. degree from the University of Michigan and also accepted a professorship at the Ypsilanti State Normal School (now Eastern Michigan University). In 1856, he became professor of Chemistry at the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan (now Michigan State University). He served as President pro tempore of the Agricultural College from 1859 to 1862 and also acted as the chaplain of the State Reform School in Lansing. 
In 1863, Fiske entered the ministry for the Methodist Episcopal Church, served as pastor of the Methodist Episcopal in Jackson, 1863–66; of the Central Methodist Episcopal Church in Detroit, 1866–69; and of the First Methodist Church in Ann Arbor, 1869–72. In 1872 he was the Presiding Elder of the Ann Arbor District. In 1873, he was awarded the D.D. from Albion College and returned for another three years to his former pastorate in Detroit. From 1876 to 1877, he was in charge of the Tabernacle Methodist Episcopal Church in Detroit. For some time, beginning in January 1875, he was editor of the Michigan "Christian Advocate", the organ of Michigan Methodism.
In 1877, Fiske became president of Albion College, in which position he remained for 22 years until his retirement in 1898. In 1878, he was honored with an LL.D. from the University of Michigan. He was elected six times as a delegate to the quadrennial general conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, held respectively in Brooklyn, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, Omaha, and Cleveland. 
Fisk was president of the State Teachers Association of Michigan in 1889. He was appointed a member of the Ecumenical Council of the Methodist Episcopal Church the met in Washington D.C., in October 1891. For sixteen years he was a trustee of the board of education of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Fisk published several works, among them: "Echos from College Platform", "Among the Professions", "Today and Tomorrow", "Choosing a Life-work", and "Man Building: A Treatise on Human Life and Its Forces" (ISBN 1417953152).

<doc id="9798796" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9798796" title="Heavy Rydberg system">
Heavy Rydberg system

A heavy Rydberg system consists of a weakly bound positive and negative ion orbiting their common centre of mass. Such systems share many properties with the conventional Rydberg atom and consequently are sometimes referred to as heavy Rydberg atoms. While such a system is a type of ionically bound molecule, it should not be confused with a molecular Rydberg state, which is simply a molecule with one or more highly excited electrons.
The peculiar properties of the Rydberg atom come from the large charge separation and the resulting hydrogenic potential. The extremely large separation between the two components of a heavy Rydberg system results in an almost perfect "1/r" hydrogenic potential seen by each ion. The positive ion can be viewed as analogous to the nucleus of a hydrogen atom, with the negative ion playing the role of the electron.
Species of heavy Rydberg system.
The most commonly studied system to date is the formula_1 system, consisting of a proton bound with a formula_2 ion. The formula_1 system was first observed in 2000 by a group at the University of Waterloo in Canada.
The formation of the formula_2 ion can be understood classically; as the single electron in a hydrogen atom cannot fully shield the positively charged nucleus, another electron brought into close proximity will feel an attractive force. While this classical description is nice for getting a feel for the interactions involved, it is an oversimplification; many other atoms have a greater electron affinity than hydrogen. In general the process of forming a negative ion is driven by the filling of atomic electron shells to form a lower energy configuration.
Only a small number of molecules have been used to produce heavy Rydberg systems although in principle any atom with a positive electron affinity can bind with a positive ion. Species used include formula_5, formula_6 and formula_7. Fluorine and oxygen are particularly favoured due to their high electron affinity, high ionisation energy and consequently high electronegativity.
Production of heavy Rydberg systems.
The difficulty in the production of heavy Rydberg systems arises in finding an energetic pathway by which a molecule can be excited with just the right energy to form an ion pair, without sufficient internal energy to cause autodissociation (a process analogous to autoionization in atoms) or rapid dissociation due to collisions or local fields.
Currently production of heavy Rydberg systems relies on complex vacuum ultra-violet (so called because it is strongly absorbed in air and requires the entire system to be enclosed within a vacuum chamber) or multi-photon transitions (relying on absorption of multiple photons almost simultaneously), both of which are rather inefficient and result in systems with high internal energy.
What makes heavy Rydberg systems interesting?
The bond length in a heavy Rydberg system is 10,000 times larger than in a typical diatomic molecule. As well as producing the characteristic hydrogen-like behaviour, this also makes them extremely sensitive to perturbation by external electric and magnetic fields.
Heavy Rydberg systems have a relatively large reduced mass, given by:
This leads to a very slow time evolution, which makes them easy to manipulate both spatially and energetically, while their low binding energy makes them relatively simple to detect through field dissociation and detection of the resulting ions, in a process known as "threshold ion-pair production spectroscopy".
Kepler's third law states that the period of an orbit is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis; this can be applied to the Coulomb force:
where formula_10 is the time-period, formula_11 is the reduced mass, formula_12 is the semi-major axis and formula_13.
Classically we can say that a system with a large reduced mass has a long orbital period. Quantum mechanically, a large reduced mass in a system leads to narrow spacing of the energy levels and the rate of time-evolution of the wavefunction depends on this energy spacing. This slow time-evolution makes heavy Rydberg systems ideal for experimentally probing the dynamics of quantum systems.

Charles Francis Hansom

Charles Francis Hansom (1817–88) was a prominent Roman Catholic Victorian architect who primarily designed in the Gothic Revival style.
Career.
He was born of a Roman Catholic family in York. He was the brother of Joseph Aloysius Hansom, architect and creator of the Hansom cab, and father of the architect Edward Joseph Hansom. He practised in partnership with his brother, Joseph, in London from 1854. This partnership was dissolved in 1859 when Charles established an independent practice in Bath with his son Edward (born 22 October 1842) as an articled clerk. He took his son into partnership in 1867, by which time the practice had moved to Bristol, with a large West Country practice of church and collegiate architecture. In Bristol he took on Benjamin Bucknall as an assistant.
He was commonly known as Francis the Hansom, as he was rather handsome.
Clifton College.
The original Clifton College buildings were all designed by Hansom.
His first design at Clifton was for Big School (then a meeting hall and now the school canteen) and a proposed dining hall. Only the former was actually built and a small extra short wing was added in 1866. This is what now contains the Marshal's office and the new staircase into Big School.
Hansom was called back to the College in the 1870s and asked to design what is now the Percival Library and the open-cloister classrooms. This project was undertaken in two stages and largely completed by 1875, although the Wilson Tower was not built until 1890.

He was born in Amsterdam. He studied piano with Egbert Veen and Ulferts Schults, and composition and conducting under Sem Dresden. In 1932 he graduated with highest honours, playing a piano concerto written by himself. After becoming a soloist with the Concertgebouw Orchestra, he won the fifth prize at the 1936 international contest for pianists in Vienna. He played all over the world and his recordings are often considered as musical "treasures". He was a member of the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition's jury in 1956.
In 1959 a nervous disorder developed in his right hand but he continued playing repertoire for the left hand. He arranged more than 80 pieces for the left hand; his "Apparitions, voor piano (linkerhand alleen)" (1961) were described by one reviewer as "intense and expressive piano music that should make it a joy for a pianist to develop his left hand." Slowly he regained power over his right hand. He became musical director of the Dutch Broadcasting Foundation and promoted Dutch contemporary music. He made many recordings but also continued composing. His compositions include music for piano solo such as "Variations imaginaires" (1967); orchestral music; vocal work; and chamber music such as "Sonatine pastorale" for oboe and piano (1961). It has been stated that Dutch composer Gerard Schurmann composed his Bagatelles (1945) for de Groot, but this is not, in fact, the case. He died in Amsterdam in 1993.

Emma L. Darwin (born 8 April 1964) is an English historical fiction author, writer of the novels "The Mathematics of Love" (2006) and "A Secret Alchemy" (2008) and various short stories. She is the great-great-granddaughter of Charles and Emma Darwin.
Biography.
Darwin was born and brought up in London. Her father was Henry Galton Darwin, a lawyer in the Foreign Office, son of Sir Charles Galton Darwin, grandson of Sir George Darwin, and great-grandson of Charles Darwin. Her mother Jane (née Christie) was the younger daughter of John Traill Christie. Jane Darwin was an English teacher, so they spent three years commuting between London and Brussels. She has two sisters; Carola and Sophia. The family spent many holidays on the Essex/Suffolk border, where much of her novel "The Mathematics of Love" is set. Darwin has lamented that any reviews of her work inevitably include references to her family background
She read Drama at the University of Birmingham, and she spent some years in academic publishing. But when she had two small children she started writing again, and eventually earned an MPhil in Writing at the University of Glamorgan, where her tutor was novelist and poet Christopher Meredith. The novel she wrote for the degree became "The Mathematics of Love", which was sold to Headline Review, as the first of a two-book deal. Meanwhile, she had found the form of a research degree so fruitful that she completed a PhD in Creative Writing at Goldsmiths' College in 2010, where her supervisor was Maura Dooley.

Eileen Younghusband (British social worker)

Dame Eileen Louise Younghusband, DBE (1 January 1902 – 22 May 1981) was internationally known for her research and teaching in the field of social work.
Her father was Sir Francis Younghusband (1863-1942), a British explorer and mystic famous for his discoveries in Central Asia and his leadership of the British Tibet campaign of 1903-04. She was a student at the London School of Economics from 1926–29, and a member of staff from 1944-58. 
In her Carnegie Reports of 1947 and 1950 she advocated "generic" training - a set of core knowledge common to all social workers. In 1954 she pioneered the teaching of a generic course that was to become the prototype of professional social work training in other universities.
In 1955 she chaired a Ministry of Health working party on the provision of training for social workers. The subsequent Younghusband Report led to the establishment of a Council for Training in Social Work and a social work certificate. In 1968 she chaired the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation's report, "Community Work and Social Change". 
Honours.
She was appointed MBE in 1946, CBE in 1955, and DBE in 1964.
Death.
In 1981, Dame Eileen Younghusband died in a car accident on a lecture tour in the United States; she was 79 years old.

Pizza Ranch

The Pizza Ranch, Inc., founded in 1981, is a "fast casual" restaurant chain. Pizza Ranch offers pizza, chicken, a salad bar, and a pizza and chicken buffet. Pizza Ranch has over 180 locations in Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Pizza Ranch is the largest regional pizza franchise in Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota.
History.
The first restaurant opened December 21, 1981 in Hull, Iowa. The six original house pizzas were the Round Up, Sweet Swine, Texan, Bronco, Prairie and Sagebrush. In the beginning Pizza Ranch only offered a Tuesday night Buffet while the rest of the dining hours were for take out or dine in orders. The second Pizza Ranch opened in Orange City in 1983 where the first noon buffet was introduced. In 1987, with the addition of a Sioux City restaurant, the menu expanded to offer chicken.
Pizza Ranch has grown over the years and now has franchises in thirteen states. Pizza Ranch's specialties are their pizza and chicken. Their headquarters, formerly located in Hull, Iowa, is currently located in Orange City, Iowa.
Pizza Ranch is a Christian based company. The Pizza Ranch vision is "To glorify God by positively impacting the world we live in."
The chain has become a popular stop for presidential candidates during the Iowa caucuses.
Menu.
Customers have two options; ordering off the menu or (at designated times) eating from the buffet.
The menu features standard pizzeria items: Cheesy Ranch Stix, various options of pizza (including specialties like Texan Taco, Round Up, Bronco, and bacon cheeseburger), Cactus Bread (dessert pizza) and Buffalo wings. Pizza Ranch also offers a salad bar, as well as "Crispy Ranch Chicken" (the company's own recipe for broasted chicken), several wraps, broasted potatoes, chicken fingers, waffle fries, ranch chips, and mashed potatoes and gravy (in some locations). The buffet features the above mentioned items, and may include local specialties daily.

Danish property bubble of 2000s

During the Danish property bubble of 2001 through 2006, Danish property prices rose faster than at any point in history, in some years increasing by more than 25%. Apartments and homes near the big cities rose especially fast.
Some of the rise can be attributed to falling interest rates, the introduction of new loan types (such as interest-only mortgages), improving economy and increasing urbanisation, higher wages along with other factors. Some observers have also noted increased interest in homes and a dramatic increase in the number of TV programs regarding home decoration, home sales, gardening etc. The increasing number of parents buying apartments for their children is also an important factor, dramatically increasing the demand on smaller apartments, typically 2 - 3 rooms, thus giving rising prices from the lower segment of apartments. 
However, many banks and analysts acknowledge that prices have increased more than can be explained by their models even when taking the economic factors into account and that homes have indeed become less affordable. In particular, it is becoming increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to enter the market, and they now make up a historically low fraction of all buyers.
This has led some observers to speculate that the Danish real estate market may be in a bubble where price increases have been fueled by speculation beyond what can be justified by fundamental economics. Some have warned that the market may be in for a correction, i.e., major price decreases. Still, as of March 2007, this has not occurred. Apartments in Copenhagen have fallen 7% in the first quarter of 2007 and the supply is still rising.
However, there are signs that the market is softening and prices have fallen in some areas. In 2006, the number of homes for sale increased dramatically, tripling in some areas. It was estimated that 10% of all apartments in Copenhagen are for sale. The total inventory of homes for sale totaled more than one average year of home sales. In the statistics for the fourth quarter 2006, some areas experienced a quarter-to-quarter price fall around 4-5%, the first significant fall in over a decade.
Two of the major real estate agencies claim they are observing price falls, with the biggest agency (Home) claiming to have observed falls since July 2006 The softening comes at a time when there has been an explosion in the building of new apartments and homes all around in the country. In Copenhagen alone, as many as 2,000 new apartments are expected to be added to the inventory during 2007.

Niloak Pottery

Niloak is a line of pottery produced by the Eagle Pottery Company of Benton, Arkansas. Eagle was founded by Charles Dean Hyten and his brothers in the 1890s and was the largest pottery-ware business in the Benton area by 1904.
In 1909, Arthur Dovey joined Eagle to help Hyten, by then sole owner of the company, develop an operation for the manufacture of art pottery. Together they produced the Niloak product, the name taken from kaolin spelled backwards.
The company was in business from 1909 to 1946. The salient feature of Niloak was its "Mission Swirl," developed by Hyten. The swirl is a multi-colored pattern using different clays and resembling marbled paper. Niloak's Mission Swirl was usually of red, tan, blue and brown in a counter-clockwise direction.
During the Depression years, Eagle manufactured a line of Niloak called "Hywood".

Yahoo!Xtra

Yahoo!Xtra was a New Zealand web portal that existed under that name from 2007 to 2011. It was a joint venture between Yahoo!7 and Telecom New Zealand. Yahoo!7 held a 51 percent stake in the company and Telecom NZ held 49 percent. Because Yahoo!7 is a 50/50 venture, Yahoo! proper was therefore a 25.5% owner of Yahoo!Xtra. Telecom announced in April 2011 that it had sold its share to Yahoo!7 and Yahoo!Xtra was rebranded as Yahoo! New Zealand.
XtraMSN.
Telecom launched internet service provider Xtra in 1996, which is New Zealand's largest ISP (). In 2001 Telecom partnered with MSN to create the web portal XtraMSN, which by 2006 was receiving over 100 million total page impressions per month. Visitor numbers to XtraMSN grew by 45 percent in its last two years and the website attracted more than 3 million unique browsers per month.
Move to Yahoo.
In December 2006, Telecom made a new agreement, founding a joint venture with Australia's Yahoo!7 – itself a joint company between the Seven Network and Yahoo! – to form Yahoo!Xtra. The six-year-old Telecom and Microsoft portal ended on 1 March 2007, with the users invited to go to either YahooXtra.co.nz or Msn.co.nz. 
Telecom reportedly left the content management of the portal to Yahoo!, who operate an Auckland-based office consisting of Sales, Marketing, Ad Operations, Production and Finance Departments. The Editorial team manages local news, sport and entertainment content.
When Telecom sold out in 2011, Yahoo!Xtra staff transferred to Yahoo! New Zealand. Telecom noted that Yahoo!7 would continue to support Telecom’s broadband customers.
Yahoo! continued to provide Telecom's email service, which came under criticism in early 2013 following a spam and phishing attack described as the biggest to have ever hit New Zealand. Telecom automatically reset thousands of users' passwords. In April, Telecom announced that despite the issue, it would keep Yahoo! on as an email provider.
People.
The Yahoo!Xtra's board of directors is chaired by the Yahoo!7 CEO, Rohan Lund, and consisted of the following members:
In April 2007, Kevin Bowler was appointed as the Auckland-based CEO of Yahoo!Xtra, but departed the business in early 2010.
Promotion.
Yahoo!Xtra's 'X meets Y' promotion at launch featured a television commercial with Regina Spektor's song "Fidelity" playing whilst a young couple undertake in a lingering kiss. This helped throw the anti-folk star under the spotlight in the New Zealand music scene, "Fidelity" becoming a hit single and one of Spektor's most successful tracks.

Super Robot Wars W

Story.
Space Calendar (SC) 99. In the previous age, the governments of Earth formed the "Federated Earth Nation" (FEN) to bring World War III to an end. After putting down the defiant lunar colony, the "Federation Space Calendar" was instituted. To alleviate environmental pressures and overpopulation, the FEN began expanding into space, constructing space colonies and asteroid cities, as well as an Orbital Space Ring around the Earth, and the development and terraforming of the Moon and Mars. This was accomplished in a short time, due to quantum leaps in physics and energy research. 
But repression of those living in the colonies by the FEN ignited a war between factions in space, and OZ, the true leaders of the FEN. This "Revolutionary War" ended in the year 98, with the death of FEN President Treize Khushrenada. From Treize's will, a "New United Nations" was formed, returning power back to the individual states. 
But the new Earth Sphere's troubles seemed to multiply. The Earth Sphere was invaded by the Radam, who seized control of the Orbital Space Ring, and the invaders known as the "Jovian Lizards", who destroyed the Mars Colony. In addition, internal strife, such as the arbitrary distinction between Coordinators and Naturals, and mechanized terrorism, seem to be taking the New United Nations to the breaking point. 
On June 13, SC 99, Kazuma Ardygun and his family, a group of "Trailers", are tasked with the job of escorting Quatre Raberba Winner and Duo Maxwell, disguised as "Heero Yuy", to Earth...
Series Included.
W marks the first Super Robot Wars game (aside from the Original Generation sub-series) to feature no machines from any series produced before 1980. The only characters from a pre-1980s series to appear are the Getter team, piloting the Shin Getter as they did in the 1990s manga. This game also marks the second Super Robot Wars title not to feature any Universal Century Gundam series, the first of which being "Super Robot Wars J". It is also the first in the franchise which features no series produced by veteran anime director "Yoshiyuki Tomino" It is also the only game in the series in which every series included has been licensed, in whole or in part, in North America.
Gameplay.
Unlike previous games, the interface is changed slightly to make use of the Nintendo DS's dual screens. While the player may still use the directional pad and buttons, the game also allows for the use of the touch screen stylus. The mini-map feature in previous titles is now fixed on the DS's top screen. When two units engage in battle, the battle sequence is shown on the top screen, while the bottom screen shows a quick summary of the stats of both units, including hit percentages. The screens may be swapped via the system menu.
The game includes the "Combo Attack" system from previous Super Robot Wars titles for the Game Boy Advance. Unlike the system in those games, however, the attacker does not need to target units lined up in a row; instead, all units standing adjacent to one another are applicable, with the maximum number being determined by the pilot's Combo Attack level. An additional "Bazaar Shop", similar to the one seen in "Super Robot Wars Alpha Gaiden", is unlockable after completing certain requirements. This shop allows players to buy a selection of units that normally only enemies use. Lastly, the "Favorites Series" system, introduced in "Super Robot Wars MX", returns.
Super Robot Wars W also adds the "Support Request" ability, working similar to the "Support Attack/Defense" system, but allows one unit to call in a supporting attack/defense from a unit held in reserve, but "not" already sortied into the battlefield. Support Request can only be used once per scenario for each time the pilot has the ability. Debuting with Super Robot Wars W is the "Double Slot System". When a player goes to the intermission screen (either by completing a stage or loading a saved game) with one of the Game Boy Advance Super Robot Wars games in the DS's "SLOT 2", a bonus item and extra credits are rewarded. The properties of the item vary depending on which game is used, and are named after the game they are from.
One noticeable change in the plot is the story in Super Robot Wars W is separated into two timelines, allowing some of the series (like Nadesico, GaoGaiGar, Tekkaman Blade, Full Metal Panic) to continue in their respective sequels. The Gundam SEED storyline only exists in the second part, even though some characters appear in the first half.

Maurice Couette

Maurice Marie Alfred Couette (9 January 1858, Tours - 18 August 1943, Angers) was a French physicist known for his studies of fluidity.
Biography.
Couette was born in Tours, France, as the only child of Alfred Ernest Couette, a cloth merchant. 
Finishing his education with the Frères des Écoles Chrétiennes he obtained a baccalauréat in humanities and in science, both in 1874, as well as bachelor's degrees in mathematics and physical science (delivered by the Faculté de Science in Poitiers) in 1877 and 1879 respectively. Following a short spell as a lecturer in Angers, he joined the 12th Artillery Regiment at Vincennes for one year of voluntary military service. In 1881 he settled in Paris and enrolled in the Sorbonne, studying physical science in preparation for the agrégation, a French teaching diploma. Couette later taught in Arcueil and the École Sainte-Geneviève in Paris. 
In 1886, Maurice Couette married Jeanne Jenny, who gave birth to eight children, five of whom reached adulthood. 
At the Sorbonne he studied under Joseph Boussinesq and from 1887 onwards worked at the Physics Research Laboratory under Gabriel Lippmann, who would later receive the Nobel Prize in Physics, where Couette also took his doctoral degree on the friction of liquids ("Studies on the Friction of Liquids", "Etude sur le frottement des liquides", Gauthiers-Villars 1890). 
Soon afterwards he was given a professorship of physics at the Catholic University of Angers (now known as Université Catholique de l'Ouest). The position, however, was poorly paid and so he had to enter into other teaching commitments, such as at the Free Faculty of Science, the School of Agriculture and several secondary schools in Angers. He still continued to pursue a variety of theoretical and experimental scientific activities. Couette was a member of the French Physics Society and retired in 1933.
Work.
Couette is best known for his contributions to rheology and the theory of fluid flow. He designed a concentric cylinder viscometer that he used to accurately measure the viscosity of fluids. The laminar flow observed in the gap between the two cylinders is known as Couette flow. He studied the boundary conditions of a fluid and showed that the "no slip" condition was satisfied for the fluids and wall materials tested.
Since 1993, the Prix Maurice Couette is awarded by the Groupe français de Rhéologie.

Tommy Naughton is the former manager of the Dublin Senior Hurling team and the former Under 21 hurling manager for Dublin. He had also previously been a selector with the senior hurling team. Naughton had Andy Cunningham, Mick O'Riordan and Damien Byrne as his management team for Dublin.
Managerial career.
Dublin.
2006.
After being appointed manager in late 2005, Naughton guided Dublin to the 2006 Division 2 National Hurling League. This title win, insured Dublin a place in Division One for 2007. The Liam McCarthy Cup proved a difficult period for Naughton as his team failed to win a game in the competition until the relegation match against Westmeath. Dublin managed to retain their McCarthy Cup status for the 2007 season while Westmeath will play in the Christy Ring Cup for 2007.
2007.
Naughton's 2007 season opened with a draw against Kilkenny in the 2007 National Hurling League. Naughton's Dublin kept their momentum by going on to defeat Galway in Parnell Park which his team in fourth position with one game in hand. Dublin then went on to continue there unbeaten run in the National Hurling League by defeating Limerick. That victory left Naughtons Dublin side in third position in the league with a game in hand over Antrim. Dublin lost the game against Antrim and then lost their final game against Tipperary which meant that Dublin missed their chance to qualify for the quarter finals or semi-finals.
Naughton first match against Wexford was seen as the potential breakthrough match for Dublins young senior hurling team in the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. Dublin showed that the gap is lessening being themselves and the bigger teams but Wexford came out of the game with the one point win with a late point from Barry Lambert. Naughtons hurlers must now play in the qualifiers of the all-Ireland championship against Cork, Offaly and Limerick or Tipperary. The Dublin team were scheduled to play their first game against Cork in Parnell Park. Cork wrote a letter to the Competitions Control Committee to request that the game be played at a neutral venue, this was met with anger by both the Offaly and the Dublin managers who were playing at home on the first weekend of the qualifiers. A change of venue never materialised and Cork played Dublin in Parnell Park in a game which Cork won by 3-20 to 0-15. Dublins next game in the qualifiers was against Tipperary who had previously beaten Dublin in the league. Naughtons men put on a good performance against Tipperary but faded towards the end, leaving Dublin at the bottom of the table.

Institute of Nuclear Power Operations

The Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO), headquartered in Atlanta, GA, is an organization established in 1979 by the U.S. nuclear power industry in response to recommendations by the Kemeny Commission Report, following the investigation of the Three Mile Island accident. INPO sets performance objectives, criteria, and guidelines industry-wide for nuclear power plant operations, and is intended to promote operational excellence and improve the sharing of operational experience between nuclear power plants. INPO is funded entirely by the U.S. nuclear industry.
Mission.
INPO conducts plant evaluations at nuclear sites and identifies both strengths and areas for improvement which are intended to be shared with other nuclear sites as a method to share best practices and common weaknesses. The results of INPO plant evaluations are not shared with the public, and any related information shared within the nuclear industry does not typically include the name of the plant. INPO assigns a score between one and five to each nuclear site following the evaluation, where an "INPO 1" is the most favorable score, and an "INPO 5" is an indicator of a nuclear site with significant operational problems.
The INPO Advisory Council consists of leading experts from the nuclear industry, as well as others whose expertise is relevant to the safe operation of nuclear power plants. Advisory Council members have included Dr. Edgar H. Schein, a retired MIT professor who is widely credited with inventing the term "corporate culture;" and Dr. Rodger Dean Duncan, a thought leader in organizational development and human performance.
About INPO Headquarters.
The lobby of INPO in Atlanta, GA is centered around a marble pedestal upon which is chiseled the word "EXCELLENCE" with the final E unfinished as a daily reminder to staff of the company's motto that "excellence is never finished."
When viewed from the second floor mezzanine, the lobby floor is designed as an optical illusion giving the appearance that it is a cone-shaped pit with the marble pedestal at the bottom.

Ernest Pingoud

Ernest Pingoud (14 October 1887 – 1 June 1942) was a Finnish composer of Alsatian parentage.
Life.
Born in Saint Petersburg, Pingoud was a pupil of the Russian composers Anton Rubinstein, Alexander Glazunov and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. He also took private lessons with Alexander Siloti, who had come to know the family when he became a neighbour of their summer residence at Tikkala Manor near Viipuri on the Karelian Isthmus. In 1906, he went to Germany to study with the music theorist Hugo Riemann and the composer Max Reger, who considered him one of his best pupils. Perhaps on his father's instructions, Pingoud also studied non-musical subjects, including philosophy and literature, as well as mining and metallurgy, at Jena, Munich, Bonn and Berlin. He chose to present a thesis on Goethe, which for some reason was never approved. In 1908, while still a student, Pingoud began a writing career by becoming musical correspondent for the "St. Petersburger Zeitung"; he held the post until 1911 and then subsequently contributed concert and opera reviews from St. Petersburg until 1914.
His first orchestral concert, held in Helsinki in 1918, heralded the arrival of a modernist musical aesthetic in Finland. The music shocked the audience, much like their counterparts at the notorious 1913 premiere of Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring" in Paris. Stylistically, the works showed the influence of Richard Strauss, Alexander Scriabin and Claude Debussy. Hostility in Finland towards his music resulted in a string of pejorative labels, including "ultra-modernism" and even "musical Bolshevism", although his command of orchestration did eventually receive some critical acknowledgement. His open rejection of Finnish nationalism may have been responsible for some of the disapproval he encountered (unlike other Finnish composers of the time he avoided composing works inspired by the Kalevala).
Pingoud committed suicide by throwing himself under a train in Helsinki in 1942.
Style.
Pingoud's preferred mode of musical expression was orchestral, especially in symphonic poems following the example of Scriabin His three piano concertos seem to look more to the models of Franz Liszt and Sergei Rachmaninoff. Although the concision of his "Fünf Sonette" has been compared to early works of the Second Viennese School, his musical language remained predominantly tonal. He made extensive use of the Prometheus chord and the octatonic collection.
Recordings.
A CD containing some of Pingoud's symphonic poems has been recorded for Ondine by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Sakari Oramo.

Wait for You

"Wait for You" is a song by former "American Idol" contestant Elliott Yamin. It is the first official single from his self-titled album "Elliott Yamin" (following the retail-only promotional hit "Movin' On").
Song information.
"Wait for You" is a slow tempo ballad composed in C major. He mentions in the song waiting indefinitely for the one he loves to come back to him. Despite the fact she has left him, he insists he knows she still loves him.
"Wait For You" is often compared to songs by 98 Degrees ("My Everything"), Natalie ("Goin' Crazy"), and S Club 7 ("Never Had a Dream Come True"), due to the tone of the song.
Charts.
The song debuted on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 at number 67. After two weeks the song dropped off the chart, but was resurrected by airplay which improved the song's digital sales. The song experienced an increase in popularity after Yamin's performance on "American Idol", and went on to become a hit single on multiple charts in the U.S. It rose to #14 in the iTunes Store and #13 on the Hot 100, giving Yamin his first top 20 hit on the chart. It also became a top five hit for Yamin on the Pop 100, Pop 100 Airplay, and on the Hot Adult Contemporary chart. The song enjoyed great radio longevity, staying in the top ten of Mediabase's Mainstream Top 40 chart for four months before finally falling out of the top ten in early October 2007. The song was the 6th most played song of 2007 on Top 40 radio and it was certified Platinum in digital sales on October 16, 2008. U.S. sales as of April 30, 2010 are 1,113,000.
Reception.
The song received a positive review from Chuck Taylor of "Billboard", complimenting the "rapid-fire, R. Kelly-esque verses adeptly mesh[ed with muscular, emotive vocal."
Music video.
The music video for the song shows Yamin in a variety of locations reminiscing about his girlfriend who has left him. The video shows Yamin on the beach, in his bedroom, and simply walking on a sidewalk picturing his ex-girlfriend's smiling face, and pleading for her to come back, just like in the lyrics of the song. The video features a recurring close up face shot of Yamin, in a black and white tone. Yamin is also shown in the studio recording the song throughout the video. In the end, his ex-girlfriend finally approaches him on the beach.
The video debuted at number one on VH1's VSpot Top 20 Countdown, and was number one for four consecutive weeks until July 28, 2007, when it went down to #2 with "Hey There Delilah" by Plain White T's in the top spot, but the following week it returned to number one. The video spent 17 weeks on the countdown, which included eight weeks at number one, and was number 19 on VH1's countdown of the Top 40 Videos of 2007.
Covers, remixes, and compilations.
Filipino R&B singer Kyla covered the song on her sixth album entitled "Heartfelt". On the Super Eurobeat (Volume 192) dance compilation, a cover version of "Wait for You" is done by eurobeat artist, Ace. The remix song sung by the band was heard in Initial D 5th Stage. Japanese singer Yusaku Kiyama covered this song in 2008, while Yamin covered Kiyama's song, "Home," in exchange.
The Midi Mafia featuring Bruce Waynne remix of "Wait for You" is available on iTunes. The Jason Nevins GTR Mix of the song has been included on "Ultra.2008", a collection of dance club remixes. Another remix features the duo Nina Sky.
"Wait For You" has been included in the "Now That's What I Call Music! 25" collection, the "Radio Disney Jams, Vol. 10" compilation, and the "Kidz Bop 13" album.
"Wait For You" is featured on the soundtrack, 'Wangan Midnight The Movie - Special Driving Style.' (湾岸ミッドナイト THE MOVIE - Special Driving Style) The movie itself is a film adaption of the popular Manga and Anime series, Wangan Midnight which was released in theaters across Japan in September 2009. The song appears as the twelfth track on the album. It is also played in one part when Tatsuya and Eriko go to the gas station

<doc id="9799194" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9799194" title="Microphone preamplifier">
Microphone preamplifier

A microphone preamplifier is a sound engineering device that prepares a microphone signal to be processed by other equipment. Microphone signals are often too weak to be transmitted to units such as mixing consoles and recording devices with adequate quality. Preamplifiers increase a microphone signal to line level (i.e. the level of signal strength required by such devices) by providing stable gain while preventing induced noise that would otherwise distort the signal. 
A microphone preamplifier is colloquially called a microphone preamp, mic preamp, preamp (not to be confused with a control amplifier in high-fidelity reproduction equipment), mic pre and pre.
Technical details.
The output voltage on a dynamic microphone may be very low, typically in the 1 to 100 microvolt range. A microphone preamplifier increases that level by up to 70 dB, to anywhere up to 10 volts. This stronger signal is used to drive equalization circuitry within an audio mixer, to drive external audio effects, and to sum with other signals to create an audio mix for audio recording or for live sound.
In use.
A microphone is a transducer and as such is the source of much of the coloration of an audio mix. Most audio engineers would assert that a microphone preamplifier also affects the sound quality of an audio mix. A preamplifier might load the microphone with low impedance, forcing the microphone to work harder and so change its tone quality. A preamplifier might add coloration by adding a different characteristic than the audio mixer's built-in preamplifiers. Some microphones must be used in conjunction with a preamplifier to function properly (e.g., condenser microphones).
Some preamplifiers exist as one part of a channel strip, which can include other kinds of audio recording devices such as compressors, equalization (EQ), noise gates, and enhancers.

Learning and Skills Network

LSN (Learning and Skills Network) was an independent not-for-profit organisation in the United Kingdom. It provided consulting, outsourcing, research, technology and training services for learning and skills.
It went into administration in November 2011.
History.
In 1995 two organisations merged, the "Further Education Unit" – an agency on curriculum issues – and the "Staff College", which trained staff in the further education sector. This new organisation was known as the "Further Education Development Agency (FEDA)".
"FEDA" was then renamed the "Learning and Skills Development Agency (LSDA)" in November 2000 to reflect its widening remit across the learning and skills sector. "LSDA"’s programmes in research, training and consultancy continued as normal under the banner of the "Learning and Skills Network". In 2006 "LSDA"’s policy and strategic work developed into the "Quality Improvement Agency for Lifelong Learning (QIA)", now known as the "Learning and Skills Improvement Service (LSIS)". LSDA’s work went on to become an independent organisation - the Learning and Skills Network.
On 28 March 2006 Learning and Skills Network registered as a UK charity (Registered No. 1113456) with the following stated objectives:
1. To promote the improvement, development and opportunities for development of the performance and skills of members of the teaching, management and other staff of the education, learning skills and children's services sectors in such a way that they are better able to be more effective and efficient in the development of the education, learning and skills of their pupils, students and other learners; and
2. To promote, encourage and develop education, learning and skills in the united kingdom and elsewhere, and in particular, by advising upon, developing and providing education, learning and skills courses, by providing flexible and innovative solutions to the education, learning and skills sector's demands and by facilitating the capability of people and organisations to provide support for learner development.
After further business developments, acquiring a selection of UK training-specialist companies including e-learning solutions provider Learning Resources International in the process, and a re-brand in 2009, the organisation officially became LSN and operated across a multitude of sectors including further education, higher education, local authorities, schools, public services and the private sector, in the UK and internationally.
In 2010, LSN entered into a Joint Venture with Oxford & Cherwell Valley College to take over ownership of Reading College, a further education college in Reading, Berkshire, UK, from then owners Thames Valley University (renamed University of West London in 2011).
LSN went into administration in November 2011. Post administration some of the purchased companies were re-acquired by their previous owners, including Learning Resources International, which has re-branded and repositioned itself as an all-in-one e-learning solutions provider for training providers and learning and development professionals.
Board.
At the time of going into administration, the Chief Executive was Yvonne Smithers.

Al DeMao

Albert Marcellus DeMao (February 29, 1920 – February 1, 2008) was an American football center in the National Football League for the Washington Redskins from 1945 to 1953. He played college football at Duquesne University and was drafted in the eleventh round of the 1942 NFL Draft.
Life and career.
DeMao was born in New Kensington, Pennsylvania. He attended Duquesne University, graduating in 1942. He was a member of the university's undefeated 1941 football team, played in the 1941 Blue-Gray Game, and played in the 1941 College All-Star Game. Drafted by the Washington Redskins, he was unable to serve because he was drafted by the United States Navy instead. Commissioned a lieutenant, DeMao commanded a landing craft during the Normandy invasion, making nine dangerous trips to the beach to deliver soldiers to the shore. Discharged from the Navy in the fall of 1945, he joined the Redskins mid-season and played nine years for the team. He was a Pro Bowl player in 1950.
Since most professional football players received only minimal pay in the 1950s, DeMao took up employment in the off-season with liquor distributor Milton S. Kronheim & Co. After retiring from football in 1954, DeMao remained with the company, rising to vice president of sales.
DeMao remained active in NFL affairs in retirement. He founded the Redskins Alumni Association (a social and charitable organziation for former Washington Redskins players) in 1957, NFL Alumni (a charitable organization to aid needy former NFL players) in 1967, and the Redskins Welcome Home Luncheon (a social event for players which kicks off each Redskins season).
DeMao married Marcella DeMao, but the couple had no children. DeMao greatly enjoyed working with children, however. He was active in Special Olympics and the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, assisted with the St. John's College High School football team, and coached football teams with the Boys Club of America and the Catholic Youth Organization. He also raised funds for the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and the Darrell Green Youth Life Foundation.
DeMao retired from Kronheim & Co. in 1986, shortly after his wife Marcella died early in the year. He married Violet DeMao at the end of 1986. Al DeMao died of pneumonia at Baltimore Washington Medical Center in Glen Burnie, Maryland, on February 1, 2008. He was survived by his wife, and interred at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Silver Spring, Maryland.

<doc id="9799302" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9799302" title="Cyprus Avenue">
Cyprus Avenue

"Cyprus Avenue" is a song written by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison and included on his 1968 album "Astral Weeks". 
In performance it was a concert highlight and closer for years to come and would end with Morrison's command, "It's too late to stop now!" (a quotation from his song "Into the Mystic") as he stalked from the stage. A dynamic 10 minute version with the usual stop-start ending was included on his 1974 live album "It's Too Late to Stop Now".
Recording and composition.
Built on a basic blues structure with an unusual arrangement, the song was recorded at the "Astral Weeks" sessions on September 25, 1968 at Century Sound Studio with Lewis Merenstein as producer. The strings and harpsichord were overdubbed a month later.
Calling it the central song of the album, Allmusic described it as "a chamber-music hybrid of folk-blues, jazz, and classical music, and over it Morrison sings a meditative memory lyric about his adolescence in Belfast, Northern Ireland." On the "Astral Weeks" recording, Morrison's vocals are backed by his acoustic guitar, Richard Davis on acoustic bass, along with flute, harpsichord and strings. 
According to Roy Kane, who grew up with Morrison in Belfast, Cyprus Avenue "...was the street that we would all aspire to — the other side of the tracks ... the Beersbridge Road had the railway line cut across it; and our side of it was one side of the tracks and Cyprus Avenue was the other... there was an Italian shop up in Ballyhackamore, that's where all the young ones used to go of a Sunday... we used to walk up to the Sky Beam for an ice cream or a cup of mushy peas and vinegar... We used to take a short cut up Cyprus Avenue..."
Morrison told biographer Ritchie Yorke that along with "Madame George" (which also references Cyprus Avenue) the song came to him in "a stream of consciousness thing", "Both those songs just came right out. I didn't even think about what I was writing."
As journalist Matthew Collin described the song: "Morrison reminisced about a more innocent time, recounting the sights and sounds of a bygone life while escaping into his imagination, an oasis of romantic reverie." According to biographer Brian Hinton, "This is a song about being trapped, 'conquered in a car seat', and reduced to tortured silence, just like in (the song) 'T.B. Sheets'. The need for innocence in the earlier song is now equated to going crazy though the vision which then unfolds is out of time, and sexless. His dream lady in her antique carriage is only fourteen years old. Van's singing is totally possessed, moving from choked desire to exultation to hushed wonder."
Live performances.
Morrison often performed "Cyprus Avenue" in the 1970s, using it to close his concerts in many instances. Jon Landau wrote a "Rolling Stone" review in 1971 describing a performance at a concert he had attended: "For an encore Van offered 'Cyprus Avenue'. Working his way up to a ferocious conclusion, he stood before the audience shaking his head back and forth, hair falling about him, looking like a man insane. Finally, with tension mounting, he ran across the stage, ran back again, jumped over a microphone chord, held the mike up to his face and screamed, 'It’s too late to stop now', and was gone." The intense live performances were said to be "clearly influenced by James Brown's stage theatrics" and in turn "influenced Bruce Springsteen, who used similar dynamics with his E Street Band shows." A live version of it as performed in concert in the summer of 1973 is included on his 1974 live album "It's Too Late to Stop Now". A live performance was again featured on Morrison's first video "Van Morrison in Ireland", released in 1981. Forty years after it was first recorded, "Cyprus Avenue" was featured on Morrison's 2009 album "Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl". On this live album, the song was placed as the sixth song instead of the fourth with some new additions in content entitled "You Came Walking Down".

Bi-pin connector

A bipin or bi-pin, (sometimes referred to as 2-pin, bipin cap or bipin socket), is a standard from the IEC for lamp fittings. These are used on many small incandescent light bulbs (especially halogen lamps), and for starters on some types of fluorescent lights as well.
Some lamps have pins placed closer together, preventing them from being interchanged with bulbs that are too high power, which may cause excessive heat and possibly fire. These are sometimes called "mini-bipin". Some of these, particularly in automotive lighting, have the pins bent back onto the sides of the base of the bulb, this is instead called a wedge base or socket.
The bi-pin base was invented by Reginald Fessenden for the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago. After Westinghouse won the contract to wire and illuminate the first electrified fair with AC instead of archrival Thomas Edison's DC, Edison and his General Electric company refused to allow his patented Edison screw-base bulbs to be used. Westinghouse overcame this by inventing the bi-pin base for use at the fair.
Types.
The suffix after the G indicates the pin spread; the G dates to the use of Glass for the original bulbs. GU usually also indicates that the lamp provides a mechanism for physical support by the luminaire: in some cases, each pin has two diameters, being larger near the ends, in order to twist-lock into position in the socket (the transition between the two diameters is a right-angle step rather than a taper); in others, the base of the lamp has a groove which can be held by a spring or clip.
A lowercase "q" at the end of the designation indicates that it is a quad-pin base, with two bi-pin pairs. These are used with compact fluorescent tubes that plug into a light fixture that has a permanent ballast.
There are also double-ended tubes (both halogen and fluorescent) with one pin at each end, as well as high-output fluorescents with recessed or shrouded contacts, which are not covered here.

WRLP-TV

WRLP-TV was a television station in Greenfield, Massachusetts which broadcast on UHF channel 32 from 1957 to 1978. For most of its history, it was a satellite of WWLP in Springfield.
WRLP came into existence because of the technical limitations UHF stations faced in the 1950s. The Springfield market was designated as an all-UHF market because it was too close to Boston, Hartford and the Capital District for VHF service. This area is very mountainous, making UHF reception difficult. Soon after WWLP signed on, the station's owners, the Putnam family, realized that much of the northern portion of the market—including Greenfield, Brattleboro, Vermont and Keene, New Hampshire--could not get an acceptable signal. They decided to open WRLP as a full-time satellite of WWLP. 
The station debuted on May 15, 1957. WRLP came from Roger L. Putnam, brother of WWLP founder William Putnam. The transmitter was located on Gunn Mountain in Winchester, New Hampshire; one of the highest points in the region. The station could also be seen in Springfield as well, creating a strong combined signal with over 50% overlap.
WRLP was a money-bleeding full-time satellite of WWLP, although, later in that timeframe, with a separate newscast. It picked up Boston Bruins, Celtics and Red Sox telecasts. Other than that, it simulcasted WWLP. It soon appeared on cable systems across Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut and upstate New York. At one point, 70% of the station's audience was on cable. Unfortunately, cable coverage was not factored into television advertising rates at the time, so WRLP reaped almost no windfall from its large cable audience. The station continued to lose money.
Finally, the Putnams ran out of patience, and WRLP went off the air on April 9, 1978 with almost no fanfare. Almost immediately afterward, the station's transmitter was dismantled and transported to Utah to start KSTU in Salt Lake City.

Hervey-Jonction railway station

Hervey-Jonction railway station (also known as simply Hervey) is located on Chemin de la Gare in Hervey-Jonction, Quebec, Canada.
This station was built in 1905 as the junction for trains travelling from Montreal to Quebec City and other regions. Today, this is where two Via Rail routes travelling together from Montreal (Montreal – Jonquière train and Montreal – Senneterre train) stop to perform a split and continue their journey in separate directions. The trains combine here on the way back to Montreal.
The current site of the station is located just opposite the chapel Hervey-Jonction, in the heart of the village. The previous site of the station-Hervey-Jonction was located about 300 meters east along the former railway line that connected the Transcontinental Quebec Hervey-Junction. This railway line has ceased to be used in 2007.
The first station was located at the south of the village of Hervey Junction, near the boundary of Sainte-Thècle.

Anwar Kharral

Anwar Kharral is a fictional character in the television series "Skins" portrayed by Dev Patel.
Characterisation.
Anwar is portrayed as boy with Pakistani origin. Although raised in an Islamic household, he is not very serious about his faith as he takes drugs at parties, drinks, partakes in premarital sex and even eats pork; although he does pray five times a day and believes that homosexuality goes against his religion. His best friend is Maxxie Oliver, although his views on Maxxie's sexual orientation sometimes put a strain on their friendship. He does lament that as a Muslim boy, he feels he has no choice in his faith.
According to the official website, his favourite things are "tequila, dope, pills, Lupe Fiasco, breasts and "X Factor"".
According to fellow actors Mike Bailey (who portrays Sid Jenkins) and Hannah Murray (who portrays Cassie Ainsworth), the characterization of Anwar was partly based on the personality of the actor Dev Patel and the role was written specifically for him after he was cast for "Skins".
Character history.
Series 1.
In "Tony" he is convinced by best friend Maxxie, to go to a "big gay night out" (because Maxxie said "there would be lots of beautiful women there and they ("Chris and Anwar") would be the only ones there to shag") along with Chris, but being bored they eventually go to Abigail Stock's party instead. In "Maxxie and Anwar", on a school trip to Russia, he finds himself at odds with Maxxie who views Anwar's pick-and-choose approach to Islam as hypocritical. He also loses his virginity to a married Russian girl, Anka, who he, along with Sid Jenkins, believed they were rescuing from her abusive father who turned out to be her husband.
The beginning of the first series finale opens with the celebration of Anwar's 17th birthday and his upcoming party on the same day. Maxxie rings him to wish him happy birthday, and asks that Anwar's parents know that he is gay or he would not attend. Anwar's party turns out to be a complete shambles with his uncle as the DJ, Anwar's relatives also introduce one of their friends with him who he wants to introduce Maxxie to. Anwar and Maxxie meet outside the party hall where Mr. Kharral, Anwar's father, spots them talking. As Mr. Kharral converses with Maxxie he blurts out that Maxxie is gay. Mr. Kharral seems to be oblivious, until Maxxie tells Mr. Kharral; seconds later. Mr. Kharral much to both Maxxie and Anwar's surprise actually explains that homosexuals are something he does not understand, but would never discriminate against, as he has faith that God will one day enlighten him. Maxxie and Anwar seem to have once again become best friends. In Chris's brawl later at the party, Anwar displays some apparent knowledge of martial arts, using spinning kicks to knock over Chris's attackers.
Series 2.
In "Sketch", he sleeps with Sketch after Maxxie turns her down. Despite telling Anwar that she always liked him, Sketch still has feelings for Maxxie, as she touches and looks at a picture of him while she has sex with Anwar.
In the next episode it is shown that he and Sketch are continuing their sexual relationship, implying that Anwar may be particularly interested in her. When the two are caught by Sid's Mum, Anwar once again expresses discomfort for his life under a Muslim household, stating that "sex hasn't been invented" in his house.
In series 2's "Chris", while at Chris' house-warming party Maxxie confronts both Sketch and Anwar about Anwar's recent choice of style which disturbingly mirrors that of Maxxie. Anwar, oblivious to Sketch's designs reacts first in disbelief then informs Sketch that she is dumped.
In the series two finale, Anwar is nervous after he receives his A-Level results in the post, as he has pledged not to open them until after Chris' funeral, even when his mother offers to steam them open. Anwar decides to open them anyway, and his reaction is one of shock, horror and dismay. Unable to go to his friends or his family, Anwar visits Sketch, his ex-girlfriend, and confides to her about them, and she reveals to him that he never gave any thought to his future. She then persuades him that his friends will eventually move on, and suggests they get back together. Anwar leaves before the results can be read out, and Maxxie reveals that the grades were, in fact, two E's and a U. When seeing Maxxie and James off at the bus to London, they persuade him to join them. Excited, he boards the bus, while Sketch watching the bus leave in dismay.
Series 3.
Anwar was briefly mentioned in the season 3 episode "Freddie". Cook mentions that he met "some skinny Asian kid named Anwar" busking and asked if he could join him. He then goes on to say that Anwar asked him in turn if he knew the "'buddah buddah cheeeese buddah' routine or something."

Hollin Hall (Virginia)

Hollin Hall is an 18th-century plantation home on Little Hunting Creek three miles (5 km) southwest of Alexandria in Fairfax County, Virginia. George Mason, a United States founding father, gave Hollin Hall to his third son, Thomson Mason, through deeds of gift in 1781 and 1786. The land, as given, totalled . Thomson Mason was the first member of the Mason family to actually live here. Before then, tenants farmed the property.
George Mason also helped Thomson Mason have a house constructed. Thomson and his wife, Sarah McCarty Chichester, celebrated Christmas, 1788 in the new house. However, as late as 1792 George Mason wrote Thomson about difficulties procuring lumber for the Hollin Hall front porch. Fire destroyed the house in 1824, four years after Thomson's death. 
An outbuilding survived and became known as Little Hollin Hall. Purchased by Edward and Eliza Gibbs, it remained in use until the 20th century. In 1916, industrialist Harley Wilson and his wife bought the property and constructed a new residence, pool and other buildings. 
The Mount Vernon Unitarian Church bought the property from Mrs. Merle Thorpe in 1958. It hosted a Congress on Racial Equality (CORE) training workshop in 1961, as well as other civil rights activities, both local and national, during the next several years. The congregation also worked against the Vietnam War and for affordable housing. In 1983, the church sold part of the property to finance construction of a new meeting house to replace the old car garage. In 1994, with the help of Alexandria's Campagna Center, the main hall was restored as a decorator showcase, and started hosting concerts several years later. Further renovations were performed in 2003-2004.

Staines Bridge

Staines Bridge is a road bridge running in a south-west to north-east direction across the River Thames in Surrey. It is on the modern A308 road and links the boroughs of Spelthorne and Runnymede at Staines-upon-Thames and Egham Hythe.
The bridge crosses the Thames on the reach between Penton Hook Lock and Bell Weir Lock, and is close to and upstream of the main mouth of the River Colne, a tributary. The bridge carries the Thames Path across the river. 
History.
In Roman times, Staines-upon-Thames lay on an important Roman road connecting London with Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester). The Roman name for Staines was "Pontes" (plural bridges) implying that there was more than one bridge and it is believed that these bridges traversed Church Island. 
A wooden bridge was referenced as early as 1228, and required regular repair. It was put out of use during the Civil War. Under an act of 1791, a stone bridge was built a little way downstream of the old one, the latter being retained. The central arch of this bridge cracked almost immediately and a third bridge of iron was completed in 1803. This failed and a fourth bridge, also of iron was opened in 1807. The old wooden bridge, which had continued in service, was then pulled down. The fifth and present bridge with three arches in white granite was designed by George Rennie. Construction started in 1827, and it was opened in 1832.
From the 1940s until the 1970s this was a hotspot for summer holiday traffic jams due to many motorists heading from London towards the south-west. When the M3 and later the M25 bridges were constructed, the traffic was diverted away from the town.
Roman Road.
The Roman Road does not have a popular name, but a straight line road route from Staines-upon-Thames to London Wall can clearly be traced on modern maps via the A30, A315, A402 and Oxford Street. It passes through the modern towns of Hounslow, Brentford, Shepherds Bush and Holborn, interrupted only by a stretch of the District line between Gunnersbury and Turnham Green. The route west of Staines is less clear, because of subsequent agricultural land use, and possibly flood erosion.
The next Roman road clockwise out of London is Watling Street to Wroxeter (Viroconium) near Shrewsbury, and the next Roman road anti-clockwise is the confusingly named Stane Street to Chichester (Noviomagus Regnorum).

Bielzia coerulans, commonly known as the Carpathian blue slug or simply the blue slug, is a species of very large land slug, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod in the family Limacidae, the keelback slugs.
Taxonomy.
"Bielzia coerulans" was discovered in 1847 and described under name "Limax coerulans" by Austrian-Hungarian malacologist Michael Bielz (1787-1866) in 1851. (His son Eduard Albert Bielz was also malacologist.)
"Bielzia coerulans" is the only species in the genus Bielzia.
Some authors, for example Russian malacologists, classify genus "Bielzia" as the only genus (monotypic) within separate family Limacopsidae Gerhardt, 1935. There has been also created separate subfamily Bielziinae I. M. Likharev & Wiktor, 1980 for genus "Bielzia".
According to the taxonomy of Bouchet & Rocroi (2005) are Limacopsidae and Bielziinae synonyms for Limacinae.
Distribution.
This species is endemic to the Carpathian Mountains in Eastern Europe.
The type locality of "Bielzia coerulans" is South Carpathians in Romania.
Description.
This is a slug which is blue when adult and 100 – 140 mm in length. Slug evenly blue or bluish green (occasionally black) with dark greyish head and tentacles, margins pale yellowish, sole pale yellowish or whitish.
Juveniles are yellowish brown with dark lateral bands.
Reproductive system: Genitalia are without penis. There is only an accessory organ for the copulation.
Ecology.
"Bielzia coerulans" inhabits deciduous and coniferous forests in mountains, usually at the bottom, or under dead wood logs.

Chromium is an OpenGL implementation. Unlike other OpenGL implementations, Chromium does not render the OpenGL command stream to a raster image in order to display on-screen. Instead, it manipulates, and moves the OpenGL command stream to other OpenGL implementations (including even other Chromium implementations). 
Chromium provides an infrastructure in which modules, known as SPUs or Stream Processing Units, can be inserted. For each OpenGL command, a SPU can modify, discard, or forward it to the next SPU. Chromium supports a client/server architecture.

Korn (liquor)

Korn (from German, "grain") is a German colorless distilled beverage that is usually made from fermented rye but may also be made from barley or wheat. Korn differs from vodka in that it is distilled to lower alcoholic proofs and less rigorously filtered, which leaves more of the cereal taste in the finished spirit.
Korn is the cheapest kind of liquor available in northern Germany. It is very popular there and is regarded as the liquor of the working class. In parts of southern Germany, inexpensive fruit brandies ("Obstler" made from apples, pears, or plums) are more popular.
Traditional Korn contains at least 32% ABV (64 proof). "Kornbrand" (also called "Doppelkorn" or "Edelkorn") must contain at least 37.5% ABV (75 proof). A weaker variety of Korn that has less than 30% ABV can be a mixture of fruit flavoring and Korn.
The term ' (“clear one”) refers to the fact that Korn is a clear liquid. ' may refer to either Korn or Doppelkorn; the term is sometimes used to market cheap spirits that are weaker (28–30% ABV) than the minimum permitted for Korn.
Korn is usually drunk neat. In some places, a beer is often ordered together with a "" (“short one”), i.e., with a shot of Korn. This combination is called a “Herrengedeck” (“gentlemen’s cover”) in most of Germany.
Some popular brands of Korn in Germany are "Berentzen", "Doornkaat", "Fürst Bismarck", "Mackenstedter", "Nordhäuser", "Oldesloer", and "Strothmann".
History.
Korn (or "Branntwein") was first mentioned in the early 16th century, when its distillation became a competition among local producers in the Free imperial city of Nordhausen. Nordhausen decreed the first purity law for Korn, and it is still produced there.
In 1799, Otto von Bismarck's father, Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand, established a distillery at Schönhausen.

Nation Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) is a radio and TV network that has been operating in the Philippines since 1963. As of December 2013, NBC is a subsidiary of MediaQuest Holdings, Inc. and is located in the TV5 Media Center, Reliance cor. Sheridan Sts., Mandaluyong City.
History.
NBC on radio.
NBC was the first network to broadcast on a 24-hour basis outside of Metro Manila. It launched the first FM stations in the Visayas and Mindanao regions, and was the first network to bridge the archipelago with the utilization of satellite broadcasting. Launched in the early 1980s, NBC was the first radio satellite network in the Philippines, and continues to cover the live games of the Philippine Amateur Basketball League and the Philippine Basketball Association.
In 1998, NBC became the only FM radio network in the Philippines consisting of member-stations named after their respective markets.
DZAR was the first to launch in 1998 through its nationwide transmission. But in 2005, Pastor Apollo C. Quiboloy purchased all NBC AM stations and rebranded the company as Sonshine Radio.
In 1973, DWFM was established as the first FM station during the Martial law era. MRS 92.3 is a music, ballad and pop-formatted FM station, which played listeners' most requested songs. When PLDT media subsidiary MediaQuest Holdings, Inc. bought NBC in 1998, the station became Joey@Rhythms 92.3 in 1998 and 923 Joey, enriched FM broadcasting and marketing, from 1998 to 2007. On 8 April 2007, XFM began after 923 Joey was signed off on 4 April, just before Holy week. XFM featured ambient, chill, down-tempo, electronica, house, lounge, trip-hop and indie music on radio until its ground-breaking format in February 2008.
In October 2009, the Manila, Cebu & Davao stations discontinued their Smooth AC format. The Manila station became U92, in partnership with All Youth Channels. It became the first CHR-formatted station focused on MTV Philippines broadcasting from a state-of-the-art studio at Silver City Mall, Frontera Verde Complex, Pasig City. The Cebu & Davao stations became WAV FM, in partnership with AudioWAV, a Makati City-based multinational company known for producing radio-like playlists for well-known Philippine companies. The other provincial stations retained their format. On September 30, 2010, U92 shut down following the dissolution of MTV Philippines in February.
On October 1, 2010, NBC, in partnership with ABC Development Corporation (TV5), its affiliate, took over the management of 92.3 FM. As part of TV5's expansion, the station will become 92.3 News FM, the first news/talk station on FM band. Last November 8, it had its debut at 12:30 am and its first day of broadcasting began at 4 am. Beginning February 21, 2011, Radyo5 is scheduled to broadcast nationwide through its provincial relay stations on AM and FM.
NBC on television.
Nation Broadcasting Corporation (NBC-41) is a commercial UHF television station owned by First Pacific conglomerate and headed by Manuel Pangilinan, who is also the chairman of the telecommunications giant Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT).
The name was unfamiliar to many Filipinos. NBC TV 41 used to be MTV Philippines. MTV (abbreviation for Music Television) is a cable television network which was originally devoted to music videos, especially popular rock music. MTV later became an outlet for a variety of material aimed at adolescents and young adults.
After 6 years of partnership in the Philippines, MTV Channel 41 has gone off-the-air after a multi-year deal with All Youth Channel (AYC). This follows the dissolution of the partnership with NBC. MTV Philippines became a defunct channel in February 2010. It was inactive until October 2010 when it began test broadcasting as TV5 and when ABC Development Corporation took over the management of NBC stations. It then took over the blocktime of UHF Channel 41, which alternates programming ABC Development Corporation. It was simulcast with Radyo5 92.3 News FM for a few months when it debuted on November 8. TV5 was scheduled to set up the first free-to air interactive-radio-on-TV channel with a format similar to DZMM TeleRadyo and RHTV in the first quarter of 2011. It was set to broadcast after its initial simulcasting of 92.3 News FM if Associated Broadcasting Company introduced this UHF channel. It plans to initialize test broadcasts on various cable and satellite operators nationwide.
On February 21, 2011, AksyonTV launched as TV5 and introduced the new UHF channel. AksyonTV was launched at exactly 4 am, airing its first program Andar ng Mga Balita hosted by Martin Andanar, which was a simulcast of the morning news program on News FM of the same title.

JB Joyce &amp; Co

JB Joyce & Co, clockmakers, were founded in Shropshire in England. The company claim to be the oldest clock manufacturer in the world, originally established in 1690, and has been part of the Smith of Derby Group since 1965. The claim is challenged by another English firm of clockmakers, Thwaites & Reed, who claim to have been in continuous manufacture since before 1740 with antecedents to 1610.
History.
William Joyce began in the North Shropshire village of Cockshutt making longcase clocks. The family business was handed down from father to son and in 1790 moved to High Street, Whitchurch, Shropshire. In 1904 J. B. Joyce moved to Station Road, Whitchurch. In 1834 Thomas Joyce made large clocks for local churches and public buildings. In 1849 the company copied the Big Ben escapement designed by Lord Grimthorpe. The firm made large clocks for many public buildings, both at home and overseas, and for some of the principal railway companies.
Since 1945 the company installed over 2,000 large public clocks in Britain and Ireland, the majority being the synchronous mains controlled type and a high proportion installed in churches.
In 1964, Norman Joyce, the last member of the Joyce family, retired and sold the company to Smith of Derby [http://www.whitchurchherald.co.uk/news/109347/j-b-joyce-facing-restructuring-process.aspx]. Many clocks were changed to electric motors made by its parent company Smith of Derby during the 1970s, thereby losing a heritage of mechanical clocks. The J B Joyce brand name has been upheld by Smith of Derby Group, who now maintain many original J B Joyce heritage pieces still in operation in public places around the world.
On 28 November 2012 a timed bid auction was held to dispose of the surplus items accumulated at the Station Road premises and lovers of the work of JB Joyce joined with interior designers and collectors of historic items in bidding to own a piece of horological history. A chapter closed in a tradition of craftsmanship and excellence in the production of mechanical clockwork marvels.

Brooklyn Bridge trolleys

From 1898 to 1950, various companies operated local trolley lines over the Brooklyn Bridge, taking passengers from many points in Brooklyn and Queens, New York City, United States to the Park Row terminal in Lower Manhattan. These lines entered the bridge roadway from Fulton Street or Sands Street in Downtown Brooklyn, some of them using elevated trackage at the Sands Street elevated railway station.
History.
Initially, all lines reached the bridge by way of the Brooklyn Heights Railroad's Graham Avenue Line tracks in Sands Street. Cars could enter Sands Street to the west at Fulton Street (many Brooklyn Heights lines) or to the east at Washington Street (Coney Island and Brooklyn Railroad's DeKalb Avenue Line) or Adams Street (Nassau Electric Railroad's Adams Street and Boerum Place Line). From Washington Street, tracks ran east on High Street to the CI&B's Smith Street Line, Concord Street on the Nassau Electric's Park Avenue Line and Vanderbilt Avenue Line, and Myrtle Avenue on the Brooklyn Heights's Myrtle Avenue Line. The first line across the bridge was the Graham Avenue Line, a minor line approaching downtown from the east on Sands Street. This line was chosen because of its half-hour headway, and its cars began crossing the bridge on January 23, 1898.
A new elevated trolley line on the Brooklyn end of the bridge opened on September 28, 1908, taking trolleys bound for Fulton Street through the Sands Street station of the elevated railways and underneath the connection to the Fulton Street Elevated. This eliminated congestion caused by the crossing of the bridge-bound cars from Fulton Street and the Brooklyn-bound cars to eastbound Sands Street. The Court Street Line, Flatbush Avenue Line, Fulton Street Line, Gates Avenue Line, Myrtle Avenue Line, Putnam Avenue Line, and Union Street Line were moved to this route.
On January 26, 1908, Brooklyn Bridge Local trolley service between the two ends of the bridge was introduced. The cable cars of the New York and Brooklyn Bridge Railway, on whose tracks the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company was providing through elevated railway service, were discontinued the next day. Local trolley service ended in 1930.

Clark Gaines

Clark Daniel Gaines (born February 1, 1954 in Elberton, Georgia) is a former American football running back in the National Football League. He played for the New York Jets and the Kansas City Chiefs over the course of his 7 year career.
Early years.
Gaines was one of only 13 African American students to volunteer to integrate Elbert County High School in Elberton, Georgia. He was coached by Boyd Outz. After graduating from Elbert County Comprehensive High School, Gaines attended Lees-McRae College and graduated from Wake Forest University. In his two seasons as a Demon Deacon, Gaines gained 1,258 yards on 336 carries (3.7 avg.), and was team captain and an All-ACC selection his senior year.
Professional career.
Gaines made his professional debut in the NFL in 1976 with the New York Jets. In his rookie season, Gaines ran for 724 yards and hauled in 41 receptions for the Jets. Having been overlooked in the draft due to injuries, Gaines signed with the Jets as a free agent and became the first rookie ever selected as Jets' MVP. In the 1976 season, he led all NFL rookies with 724 yards rushing despite not starting until the seventh game, set a franchise record with four 100-yard rushing games in a single season, and was selected AFC Offensive Rookie of the Year by NFL Players Association. 
After being sidelined due to injuries in 1978, Gaines returned in 1979 as a dominant force for the Jets once again. In the 1979 season, he became the first Jet ever to lead the team in rushing and receiving twice, finishing the season fourth among AFC rushing leaders, tied for first in the AFC in yards per carry, and fumbled only once in 186 carries. "The Sporting News" named him the best running back in the AFC East and the most individual offensive improvement in the division in 1979.
On September 21, 1980, Gaines broke a Jets franchise record with 17 catches in a singe game against the San Francisco 49ers, a franchise record that still stands. Gaines is currently 3rd in the NFL record books for receptions per game (and first among running backs). He was the first undrafted running back to reach 500 yards rushing as a rookie, and is now one of only six in NFL history to do so.
He "wore many hats" for the Jets: although technically a running back, he was also a prolific receiver, was an intimidating blocker in short yardage situations, and played special teams.
NFLPA.
Gaines has been employed with the NFL Players Association for 22 years, and in April 2008 was promoted to Assistant Executive Director.
Personal.
His jersey is retired at Elbert County Comprehensive High School. In 2009, he received the Elbert County Native Citizen Award by the Elbert County Chamber of Commerce.

Baseline (medicine)

A baseline in medicine is information found at the beginning of a study or other initial known value which is used for comparison with later data. The concept of a baseline is essential to the daily practice of medicine in order to establish a relative rather than absolute meaning to data. The meaning of baseline in medicine is very similar to that of the running baseline (baseball) being the direct path that a baserunner is taking to the base he is in route to. If the baserunner is outside the 3 foot margin around his running baseline, then he is considered out. Whereas if a patient with kidney failure (whose creatinine is usually 3.0 mg/dL) suddenly has a creatinine of 5.0 mg/dL, then his creatinine is out of his normal. For that person with kidney failure, absolute normal no longer applies because he will never again be able to obtain an absolutely normal creatinine level (0.5-1.2 mg/dL) with kidneys that no longer function properly.

<doc id="9800018" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9800018" title="Loïc Dachary">
Loïc Dachary

Loïc Dachary (born 1965) is a free software developer and activist in France, and has been active since 1987. Dachary currently contributes to free software projects and acts as president of the Free Software Foundation in France. He is a speaker for the GNU Project and the April association.
Career.
Dachary started as a C and Lisp developer in 1986. In 1987, he was hired to teach Unix and programming at Axis. In 1988, Lectra launched a 68k based hardware, and Dachary led a Unix System V port using the GNU Compiler Collection. When the project was completed, he took a sabbatical in 1989 to create the GNA, a non-profit group for the development and distribution of free software. Dachary went back to development for Tic Tac Toon and Agence France-Presse (AFP), where he learned C++.
In 1995, he founded the Ecila search engine, which was acquired by Tiscali and discontinued in 2001. After two years dedicated to the FSF France, Dachary worked for INRIA on RFID software in 2003. Starting with Mekensleep in 2004, Dachary wrote poker related free software, which was published as part of the PokerSource project. In 2007 he was hired by OutFlop, a startup specialized in poker software services based on PokerSource. In 2011 he became a Free Software freelancer and worked on XiVO and cardstories.
In January 2012, Loïc became involved in OpenStack and now works as a Ceph developer.
Non-profit career.
GNA.
When he was employed by Axis in 1987, Dachary offered copies of free software on magnetic tapes, such as Emacs or the GNU Compiler Collection). The Internet was difficult to access at the time and he became a distributor of software. After working on the Lectra project, Dachary created the GNA (Gna's Not Axis) non profit organization in 1989.
Although the original goal of GNA was to develop free software, it started as a news and mail provider. The connectivity to the a news and mail provider in Washington, D.C. was provided by Agence France-Presse (AFP) over a half-used satellite link. In 1990, GNA provided mail and news feeds to over 200 non profit organisations, individuals, and companies.
GNA kept distributing free software on magnetic tapes. Compiling from the sources was difficult and Dachary packaged pre-compiled binaries for the Motorola 68000 family, x86 and SPARC. He left tapes at his computer book store, Le Monde en "tique" who sold them to his customers.
Richard Stallman occasionally visited France and met Dachary when he started to spread free software. During his year at GNA, Dachary took advantage of Stallman's presence in France to organize conferences at École nationale supérieure d'arts et métiers, Paris 8 University and his former school École Pour l'Informatique et les Techniques Avancées.
Nineties.
In 1990, Dachary took a secondary role in GNA as his friend Hugues Lafarge became president. In 1996, he met with the founders of April, a French Free Sotftware NGO, to whom he donated their first server, hosted at Ecila's office.
Savannah.
Dachary returned to a more active role in non profit work in 2000, when he wrote the code for the newly created SourceForge platform. In an attempt to understand the project dynamics, he travelled to VA Linux offices and met with Eric Raymond and Tim Perdue, but felt the team was too focused on in-house interactions to welcome an external contributor. However, he became familiar with the published code base and when VA Linux started to use proprietary software, he created an alternative platform using the latest free software code base published: GNU Savannah. In early 2001, Dachary secured the funds to buy hardware for the Free Software Foundation offices and moved to Boston to install them. In late 2001, when VA Linux asked him to assign copyright for his contributions, Dachary published an article explaining why it was time to move away from SourceForge. In 2002, Dachary gradually delegated his responsibilities to GNU Savannah contributors and Free Software Foundation staff and retired in 2003.
Copyleft compliance.
In 2001, the Free Software Foundation established a presence in Europe and Dachary took part in the process by creating FSF France (renaming GNA publication number 20010027 in "Journal Officiel") and serving as the first vice president of FSF Europe. In addition to supporting the growth of GNU Savannah, FSF France assisted French developers and companies with GPL compliance. With Bradley M. Kuhn, executive director of the Free Software Foundation at the time, Dachary worked the first contract of the new "GPL Compliance Labs" for a French governmental agency. His ongoing interest in enforcing Copyleft licenses led to a few visible outcomes such as the publication of C&CS by Orange and SFR, and the court case involving Free, but most of it is kept confidential. In 2009, Dachary joined the Software Freedom Conservancy board of directors.
EUCD.INFO.
In late 2002, Dachary became concerned by the lack of protest against the European Copyright Directive that was about to be transposed into French law. Instead of acting in the name of FSF France and because the problems were not limited to free software, he launched the EUCD.INFO initiative. After six months of full-time lobbying, he hired Christophe Espern to work for FSF France and delegated his responsibilities. Dachary has not played an active role since, although he keeps in touch through his friend Jérémie Zimmermann, Christophe Espern's successor, co-founder and spokesperson of La Quadrature du Net.
GNA! and hosting.
In late 2003, the GNU Savannah compromise created tensions in the governance. In early 2004, Dachary worked with Mathieu Roy to set up GNA! using the same policy and software, but with a different decisional process. In 2010, the maintainers of Savannah and GNA! overlapped and worked as a network administrator for both.
Although centralized forges such as GNA! are popular, Dachary has recently gradually transgressed towards distributed hosting. He collects machines and hosting facilities under the umbrella of FSF France and runs OpenStack based clusters on them. Dachary helps projects such as the GNU Compiler Collection and Software Freedom Conservancy by providing and maintaining machines on this infrastructure. In late 2008, he created an amateur datacenter (codename microdtc34) in a seven square meter room in the center of Paris with Laurent Guerby who was in the process of creating the tetaneutral.net, a non profit ISP.
April.org.
Dachary was appointed an honorary member of the April association. On the behalf of April he participated in the "commission spécialisée de terminologie et de néologie de l'informatique et des composants électroniques" from 2006 to 2009, primarily to discuss the definition of "free software".
Upstream University.
Shortly after the April 2012 OpenStack summit, Dachary founded Upstream University to train developers to become better Free Software contributors.

During his second season with the Tigers, 1981–82, Parks upped his scoring average to 11.4 points per game in leading the team to a 24–5 record. As a junior, Parks received All-America honors from "The Sporting News" after scoring 488 points and helping his team to an NCAA Midwest Region invitation. He capped his Memphis career by again averaging in double figures in scoring and finished his senior season with a Sweet 16 appearance in the NCAA Tournament. Parks is now ranked 15th in his alma mater's career scoring with 1,266 points.
Professional career.
Parks was chosen in the third round by the Atlanta Hawks in the 1984 NBA Draft, the 58th player of 228 chosen in the draft. Wearing his trademark no. 22, Parks played for the Hawks in the NBA pre-season but was cut before the regular campaign started. He also played parts of four seasons in the Continental Basketball Association, appearing in 83 games for the Pensacola Tornados, Mississippi Jets, Rockford Lightning and Rochester Renegade between 1985 and 1994.
International
Parks began a career overseas in France in 1986 and in 1987, then played in the Philippines where he would become a legend. He made his PBA debut with San Miguel Beer in 1987. He saw action the following year for Formula Shell until 1999. He finished his 12-year PBA career with nearly 9,000 points, over 3,000 rebounds and more than 1,000 assists in 220 games. In 1989 alone, he averaged 52.6 points in 23 games with a high of 72. Parks won a PBA record of seven Best Import awards and led his teams (San Miguel and Shell) to five PBA championships. While in the Philippines, Parks also appeared in several Filipino movies.
After his PBA stint, Parks went to Indonesia to play for Aspac Jakarta in the Kobatama (Kompetisi Bola Basket Utama) league. Parks, called by Indonesian fans as 'The Ice Man' or 'Uncle Bob,' suited up as import for the Indonesian club teams in the Seaba tournament and Asian Basketball Confederation (now FIBA-Asia) Champions Cup.
Retirement.
He returned to Memphis in 2005, partly to finish his degree under the invitation of coach John Calipari and the athletic department. Another motivation for the move was to bring his son Bobby Jr. (also known as "Ray Ray"), a promising teenage player, to Memphis to expose him to better basketball competition. Parks also served as the personal assistant to John Paul "Jack" Jones, a wealthy University of Virginia alumnus from Memphis who is the namesake for UVA's current basketball arena.
On June 2, 2010, Parks and his family moved back to the Philippines. Parks accepted a position as athletics director at National University in Manila. During that time, he was in the middle of a battle with laryngeal cancer; his treatment was reported to be successful in April 2011. In November 2010, Bobby Jr. signed a letter of intent to play basketball at Georgia Tech, but then disappeared from the view of both Tech and the American media for several months. Eventually, Luke Winn of "Sports Illustrated" tracked the younger Parks down, discovering in April 2011 that Bobby Jr. had enrolled at NU and was expected to lead the Bulldogs in the upcoming UAAP season.
In 2011, the San Miguel Beermen (ABL) joined the ASEAN Basketball League and named Parks its first head coach. He led the team to a finals appearance, losing to the Indonesia Warriors.
Death.
On March 30, 2013, Parks died after a long battle with lung cancer, which developed from his previously untreated laryngeal cancer.
Legacy.
To commemorate Park's legacy, the PBA renamed the prestigious "PBA Best Import of the Conference Award" to the "Bobby Parks PBA Best Import of the Conference Award". The award was renamed on March 31, 2013, a day after Park's death, as it coincided with the scheduled awarding during the 2013 PBA Commissioner's Cup. The first recipient of the renamed award was Robert Dozier of the Alaska Aces—coincidentally, also a former Memphis player.
Parks became the second American and the first import ever inducted into the PBA Hall of Fame in October 9, 2009.
Parks was inducted into the University of Memphis' M Club Hall of Fame on September 10, 2004.

Lt24 is a radio station from San Nicolás de los Arroyos, Argentina.
On air since October 10, 1969.
Prior to this date, Radio San Nicolas was obliged to transmit its programs by cable alone because the political will did not yet exist for open competition for broadcast licenses. Cable broadcasts began February 16, 1963 for some 6,000 inner city households, into which special receivers were installed. The service was provided free of charge.
Radio San Nicolas became the first radio station in Argentina to transmit by cable. It soon emerged as a valuable consulting resource for parties interested in establishing similar cable stations in other cities.
In September 1993, LT24 AM 1430 and FM88 were the first stations in the region to utilize digital audio for on-air advertising.
On December 31, 1998, LT24 launched live, around the clock broadcasts over the Internet using the RealAudio format.
Today, the station broadcasts live in MP3 using an Icecast server.

Tekhnologichesky Institut (Saint Petersburg Metro)

Tekhnologichesky Institut () is a cross-platform interchange station of the Saint Petersburg Metro. The stations consists of two halls, with both serving located on the Kirovsko-Vyborgskaya Line and Moskovsko-Petrogradskaya Line trains. The first hall serves the southbound trains while the second hall serves the northbound ones.
History.
The first hall was opened on November 15, 1955, as part of the first metro line between Avtovo and Ploshchad Vosstaniya. The name comes from the fact that the surface vestibule is located immediately next to Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology. The architects were A.M. Sokolov and A.K. Andreyev (surface vestibule and underground hall). The basic theme of the station is the achievements of Russian and Soviet science. The basic material for decorating the underground hall is Ural marble. On the columns are 24 bas reliefs with portraits of well-known Soviet scientists. On the platform walls are placed decorative grilles.
This deep column station existed for several years as an ordinary station of the Kirovsko-Vyborgskaya Line, with trains traveling in both directions. But on April 29, 1961, the second hall was opened, as a part of the second line of the Saint Petersburg Metro. This became the first cross-platform facility in the USSR, coming into full operation on November 1, 1963.
The second hall, in contrast to the first, was built in the functional style, called for by Nikita Khrushchev's program of total economy. The architects A.I. Pribulskiy, A.Ya. Macheret, and V.V. Gankevich designed an almost white wall with decorative texts on the marble columns, chronicling the accomplishments of Soviet science and technology, which were continually added to over time.
Initially, the second hall had no exit to the surface and was connected to the first by a central passage, during the construction of which the bas reliefs of Friedrich Engels and Joseph Stalin were removed. Only in 1980 did the architects A.S. Getskin, A.V. Kvyatovsky, and I.E. Sergeyev build a second inclined passage and join the vestibule of the first hall with the second.
Exits from both halls are located at the northern end, with three escalators each.

Maurin Quina

Maurin Quina is a French apéritif advertisement painted by Leonetto Cappiello in 1906. It is perhaps Cappiello's most famous poster.
The image features a devilish figure sneakily de-corking the bottle; Cappiello used "infernal imagery" in several of his posters for alcohol. The green devil in particular evokes "la fée verte" (the green fairy), the nickname for absinthe, a drink popular during the Belle Époque. The product was banned by the French government shortly after it was released. This poster, however, is an advertisement for an alcoholic beverage that went out of production in 1906. Maurin is the brand name and Quina is the type of alcohol it is. The product has since been reintroduced to both the French and American marketplace, featuring Cappiello's poster as the label. It is cherry in flavor with a background of quinine. It is similar to a liqueur, but does not contain enough sugar content to legally be classified as one.

Egyptian Healy

John J. Healy (October 27, 1866 – March 16, 1899), nicknamed "Egyptian" and "Long John", was a pitcher in Major League Baseball. Healy played for the St. Louis Maroons, Indianapolis Hoosiers, Washington Nationals, Chicago White Stockings, Toledo Maumees, Baltimore Orioles, and Louisville Colonels from 1885 to 1892. He was tall and weighed .
Career.
Healy was born in Cairo, Illinois (hence his nickname) in 1866. He joined the National League's St. Louis Maroons in 1885 and made his major league debut on September 11, at the age of 18. He made eight starts late in the season, going 1–7 with a 3.00 earned run average.
In 1886, Healy pitched 353.2 innings and went 17–23 with a 2.88 ERA. He led the Maroons' pitchers in innings pitched and wins. Healy, whose key pitch was the fastball, also finished among the league's top 10 in strikeouts (213), bases on balls (118), and wild pitches (40).
Healy was purchased by the Indianapolis Hoosiers on March 8, 1887. That season, he was the ace of the Indianapolis pitching staff and finished with a record of 12–29. His 29 losses were the most of any pitcher in the NL. Healy also went on an "around-the-world" tour with other American baseball players that year, playing exhibition games in Europe, Asia, and Australia. When Healy returned home, the mayor of his hometown honored him with "a special ceremony and a pin."
After going 12–24 in 1888, Healy was traded to the Washington Nationals for Jim Whitney. Healy started 12 games for Washington, going 1–11 with a 6.24 ERA before being released on July 8. He signed with the Chicago White Stockings three days later and went 1–4 for them before being released again. During the 1880s, Healy had an overall win-loss record of 44–98; his .310 winning percentage was the lowest of any major league pitcher in the decade.
Healy spent 1890 with the Toledo Maumees of the American Association. Once again, he led his team in innings pitched (389) and wins (22), setting career-highs in both categories. He had a winning record for the only time in his career, and he finished fourth in the AA with 225 strikeouts.
In 1891, Healy was sold to the Baltimore Orioles. He compiled a record of 8–10 that season and 3–6 the next before Baltimore released him. Healy then finished his major league career by playing one month for the Louisville Colonels. He had a career win-loss record of 78–136, and in 2004, baseball historian Bill James wrote that he was the fifth-unluckiest pitcher of all-time in regards to his record.
Healy played for the minor league Minneapolis Millers in 1895 and 1896. He then retired from the game and worked as a St. Louis policeman before becoming ill. On March 16, 1899, Healy died of consumption in St. Louis. He was buried in Calvary Cemetery.

Aurora 'Rory' Martínez, usually credited simply as “Rory,” is the credited director of at least 72 publicly released movies. She currently resides in Chicago, Illinois and is happily married to Christian Guajardo and owns a dog.
Martínez’s films are produced almost exclusively in Mexico, with dialogue in Spanish and marketed to the Latin American population. Although her productions receive virtually no theatrical release in the United States, they can be found in many U.S. video outlets, both in VHS and DVD format. 
Martínez’s movies are generally in the action genre, concentrating on such staple themes as feuds between drug traffickers, illegal trade in human organs, and police investigations, and thus they are not of a kind that normally attracts the attention of foreign film critics. The two facts aforesaid likely explain why she is virtually unknown in the English-speaking world, despite her highly prolific output. 
Martínez appears on screen in many of her movies, though almost never in a leading role. She has often cast Mario Almada in leading roles. Like many other low-budget Mexican action films, her movies tend to portray extreme, explicit violence.

<doc id="9800120" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9800120" title="Battle of the Brazos">
Battle of the Brazos

The Battle of the Brazos was the official collegiate sports rivalry between the Baylor Bears and Texas A&M Aggies. The rivalry is named for the Brazos River that flows by the two schools, which are only 90 miles apart. The Battle of the Brazos debuted in 1899.
History.
In the early days of the rivalry (1905 and earlier), Baylor and Texas A&M played each other multiple times in a single year, possibly due to a dearth of regional opponents. The two teams were also geographically close with only a one hour train ride separating the two colleges.
The Brawl.
The 1926 football game coincided with Baylor's homecoming. During halftime Baylor Homecoming floats paraded around the field. When a float - actually a car pulling a flatbed trailer with several female Baylor students - neared the section where the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets sat, a cadet raced towards the car to try to steer it away. The motion caused Louise Normand to fall off the truck, injuring her and inciting a large riot. Students began using metal folding chairs and planks of wood that had been used as yard markers for weapons. Texas A&M student Lt. Charles Sessums was hit in the head during the melee and, although he initially appeared to recover, he died following the game.
On December 8, 1926, the two school presidents agreed to temporarily suspend athletic relations between the schools. The schools would not compete against each other in any athletic event for the next four years. Baylor and Texas A&M would not meet in football again until 1931.
Pranks.
In 1936 Baylor students awoke to find Texas A&M signs plastered across campus, with red paint applied to turn the Baylor flagpole into a barber pole. A huge sign on Waco Hall predicted, "A and M 50, Baylor 0."
In 1950, Aggies snuck into the new Baylor Stadium, then under construction, to plant oats in the gridiron grass in order to have the sprouting plants spell out the letters “A and M.” 
It was once great sport before a big football matchup for Aggie students to drive to Waco with nefarious intentions of capturing Baylor's bear mascot. Baylor students sometimes resorted to extraordinary defensive measures. In 1946 they placed mascot Chita in the custody of Waco Police so the Aggies could not find her.
In the 1950s, two Aggie students drove to Waco and stole the Baylor mascot, a young bear cub, from the Baylor campus. While they were driving back to College Station in a brand–new car belonging to one of their families, the bear became enraged. Twenty–miles from Waco, the bear ripped out the inside of the car, and the boys set it free. The young men were caught when they took the car to be repaired.
In 1954, Baylor mascot Nip and her trailer disappeared. Yet, the next day both the bear and trailer were found under a bridge on the highway to College Station.
Baylor students likewise pranked the Aggies, often sneaking onto the Texas A&M campus to spray green paint on the statue of Lawrence Sullivan Ross. Ross was the third president of Texas A&M, who briefly attended Baylor as a preparatory student.
Former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, was expelled from Baylor after he was in part found painting one of A&M's buildings green.
Football.
The competitive peak of the series between Baylor and Texas A&M most likely occurred between 1960 and 1990 during which time Baylor won 13 games, A&M won 16 games, and two games ended in ties. During that same time period 18 of the 31 games played saw the final margin of victory to be 7 points or less. "Texas Football" magazine voted the 1986 game between the schools the Game of the Decade of the 80s in the Southwest Conference. Baylor led the game 17–0 in the 1st half and was positioned to score again when the Texas A&M defense was able to stop the Bears with a goal line stand. The Aggies came back in the final minutes with an 80-yard drive resulting in a touchdown and a 31–30 victory. The victory allowed the Aggies to claim the SWC Championship and advance to the Cotton Bowl for a second straight year. while Baylor finished in 2nd and ended the year with a victory over Colorado in the Bluebonnet Bowl.
Another exciting game was the 1978 contest in which little-known Baylor freshman Walter Abercrombie rushed for 207 yards in a 24–6 Baylor win in College Station. The 207 yards were a then NCAA record for rushing yardage in an initial game. In the 1980 contest Baylor won by the score of 46–7, going on that year to win the SWC Championship by a record 3 games and garnering a berth in the Cotton Bowl, where they were beaten by Alabama.
The thrilling 1986 A&M win began a period of domination in the series, in which Baylor did not beat A&M for 18 seasons (17 losses and a tie in 1990). The most lopsided match in the history of the rivalry occurred in 2003 when the Aggies routed the Bears by a score of 73-10. However, in 2004 an underdog Baylor Bear team defeated the No. 16 ranked Aggies 35–34 in overtime at Floyd Casey Stadium when the Bears converted a dramatic 2-point conversion on the final play of the game to earn their first win over the Aggies since 1985. The rivalry again became bitter in 2005 when the Aggies completed two fourth down conversions to win at home 16–13 in overtime.
The Baylor Bears defeated the Aggies for the second time in 5 years in 2008 but Baylor has not won at Kyle Field since 1984 (13 games). Baylor has won 2 of the last 4 series games in Waco (2004 & 2008). The series future will be in doubt starting in 2011 when Texas A&M joins the Southeastern Conference. In 2011 A&M won the probable final series meeting for the forseeable future 35-28 at Kyle Field.
Basketball.
In men's basketball, Baylor and A&M have competed since the 1914–15 debut season of the Southwest Conference. With 211 games played, A&M leads the series with 136 wins, 71 losses and 4 ties. In the old SWC Baylor established itself as a contender when they won the 1932 SWC Championship. Then Baylor established themselves as a National Power with conference titles in 1946, 1948, 1949, and 1950 along with NCAA Final Four appearances in 1948 and 1950. The 1948 team played for the National Championship vs an Adolph Rupp coached Kentucky team. Baylor would again make the NCAA tourney field in 1988. Since the formation of the Big 12 the teams have followed somewhat parallel paths. Both spent the early years of the conference as lower-division teams (they combined for one NIT appearance and zero NCAA appearances from 1996 to 2004, and both suffered winless conference seasons during that span). However, in more recent years, they have grown into Big 12 contenders, with A&M reaching the NCAA's six straight years between 2006 and 2011 and Baylor making NCAA tourney appearances in 2008 before reaching a higher perch by advancing all the way to the Elite 8 in 2010 and 2012. In 2011, Baylor did not reach postseason play but swept the series with the NCAA Tourney-Bound Aggies. In 2013 Baylor just missed out on an NCAA tourney bid but made the most of their situation by winning the historic NIT tournament at Madison Square Garden in NYC. In 2014 Baylor again made a deep run in the NCAA tourney by making it to the Sweet 16. Future games have been scheduled in the Battle of the Brazos series beginning in 2014 at Waco followed by a 2015 meeting in College Station.

<doc id="9800150" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9800150" title="Mining in Roman Britain">
Mining in Roman Britain

Mining was one of the most prosperous activities in Roman Britain. Britain was rich in resources such as copper, gold, iron, lead, salt, silver, and tin, materials in high demand in the Roman Empire. The abundance of mineral resources in the British Isles was probably one of the reasons for the Roman conquest of Britain. They were able to use advanced technology to find, develop and extract valuable minerals on a scale unequaled until the Middle ages.
Lead mining.
Lead was essential to the smooth running of the Roman Empire. It was used for piping for aqueducts and plumbing, pewter, coffins, and gutters for villas, as well as a source of the silver that sometimes occurred in the same mineral deposits.
The largest Roman lead mines were located in or near the Rio Tinto (river) in southern Hispania.In Britannia the largest sources were at Mendip, South West England and especially at Charterhouse. In 49 A.D., six years after the invasion and conquest of Britain, the Romans had the lead mines of Mendip and those of North West England and Wales running at full shift. By 70 A.D., Britain had surpassed Hispania as the leading lead-producing province. The Spanish soon lodged a complaint with Emperor Claudius, who in turn put limits on the amount of lead being produced in Britain. However, these limits were ignored and had the opposite effect on British lead production.
Silver extraction.
The most important use of lead was the extraction of silver. Lead and silver were often found together, with the silver being encased in the lead ore. The Roman economy was based on silver, as the majority of coins were minted from the precious metal.
The process of extraction, cupellation, was fairly simple. First, the ore was heated until the lead, which contained the silver, separated from the rock. The lead was removed, and heated up to 1100° Celsius using hand bellows. At this point, the silver separated from the lead, and was put into molds which, when cooled, would form ingots that were to be sent all over the Roman Empire for minting.
Gold mining.
Britain's gold mines were located in Wales at Dolaucothi. The Romans discovered the Dolaucothi vein soon after their invasion, and they used hydraulic mining methods to prospect the hillsides before discovering rich veins of gold-bearing quartzite. The remains of the several aqueducts and water tanks above the mine are still visible today. The tanks were used to hold water for hushing during prospecting for veins, and it involved releasing a wave of water to scour the ground and remove overburden, and expose the bedrock. If a vein was found, then it would be attacked using fire-setting, a method which involved building a fire against the rock. When the hot rock was quenched with water, it could be broken up easily, and the barren debris swept away using another wave of water. The technique produced numerous opencasts which are still visible in the hills above Pumsaint or Luentinum today. A fort, settlement and bath-house were set up nearby in the Cothi Valley. The methods were probably used elsewhere for lead and tin mining, and indeed, were used widely before explosives made them redundant. Hydraulic mining is however, still used for the extraction of alluvial tin.
Long drainage adits were dug into one of the hills at Dolaucothi, after opencast mining methods were no longer effective. Once the ore was removed, it would be crushed by heavy hammers, probably automated by a water wheel until reduced to a fine dust. Then, the dust would be washed in a stream of water where the rocks and other debris would be removed, the gold dust and flakes collected, and smelted into ingots. The ingots would be sent all across the Roman world, where they would be minted or put into vaults.
Iron mining.
There were many iron mines in Roman Britain. The index to the Ordnance Survey Map of Roman Britain lists 33 iron mines: 67% of these are in the Weald and 15% in the Forest of Dean. Because iron ores were widespread and iron was relatively cheap, the location of iron mines was often determined by the availability of wood for smelting fuel, which Britain had in abundance. Great amounts of iron were needed to fuel the Roman war machine, and Britain was the perfect place to fill that need.
Many underground mines were constructed by the Romans. Once the raw ore was removed from the mine, it would be crushed, then washed. The less dense rock would wash away, leaving behind the iron oxide, which would then be smelted using the bloomery method. The iron was heated up to 1500°C using charcoal. The remaining slag was removed and generally dumped.
After being smelted, the iron was sent to forges, where it was reheated, and formed into weapons or other useful items.
Working conditions.
The majority of mine workers were slaves, although skilled artisans were needed for building aqueducts and leats as well as the machinery needed to dewater mines and to crush and separate the ore from barren rock. Reverse overshot water-wheels were used to lift water, and sequences of such wheels have been found in the Spanish mines. A fragment of a wheel found at Dolaucothi shows they used similar methods in Britain.
The working conditions were poor, especially when using fire-setting, an ancient mining method used before explosives became common. It involved building a fire against a hard rock face, then quenching the hot rock with water, so that the thermal shock cracked the rock and allowed the minerals to be extracted. The method is described by Diodorus Siculus when he discussed the gold mines of Ancient Egypt in the first century BC, and at a much later date by Georg Agricola in his De Re Metallica of the 16th century. Every attempt was made to ventilate the deep mines, by driving many long adits for example, so as to ensure adequate air circulation. The same adits also served to drain the workings.

AMCARA Broadcasting Network

AMCARA Broadcasting Network was a Philippine television network of ABS-CBN Corporation, now-defunct Studio 23 Network, now later ABS-CBN Sports and Action is located in ABS-CBN Broadcast Center, Sgt. Esguerra Ave., Quezon City.
History.
1992-1996: Ermita Electronics Corporation era.
The station was acquired from Ermita Electronics Corporation in July 1996, which initially owned the frequency of the station that began airing in May 1992 from a densely populated commercial area in Quezon City with a rebroadcast of MTV Asia, then telecasting from the STAR TV platform. It was later showing ] refeeds from 1993 onwards as MTV made the decision to split from STAR and form its own satellite TV portal in Asia.
1996-2010: AMCARA Broadcasting Network era.
Three years later in 1996, MTV Asia returned to the Philippine airwaves after establishing a new regional base in Singapore. ABS-CBN was picked as the broadcast arm of MTV Asia in the Philippines at the time, and Channel 23 started test broadcasts in September 1996 with rebroadcasts of the new MTV Asia from Singapore. A month later, it launched its own programming under the station name Studio 23 and adopted the slogan "Premium Television". The station initially ran MTV rebroadcasts in the day, and ran its own shows at primetime.It also ran for 24 hours, but financial limitations forced it to sign off at 3AM every day. That has been the broadcast arrangement ever since.
5 years later, MTV Asia acquired a new local UHF frequency and Studio 23 formally became a full station, adopting rebroadcasts of its in-house cable channel Myx to fill in the void left by MTV Asia, and came up with intensified programming led by the popular reality TV game show "Survivor", and several top rate US shows like "7th Heaven", "Will and Grace" and "Charmed", among others.
By 2004, the channel opened its doors to Taglish programs. It also by that time adopted a new slogan, "Kabarkada Mo!". Previous to this trend, the station was already running its own English newscast, "News Central", since 2001, effectively replacing the network's "The World Tonight", previously on Channel 2 which had gone on to be a cable-only newscast of ANC, a cable channel of ABS-CBN. It also geared its mostly young viewers to trends in the tech world with "Digital World". With the intensified Taglish presence, Studio 23 today now has the nightly Tagalog gag newscast "Wazzup Wazzup", the interactive youth talk show "Y-Speak", and several others. It even provided support shows to its highly successful local reality programs "Pinoy Big Brother" and "Pinoy Dream Academy", both acquired from Endemol of the Netherlands and are big hits on Channel 2.
Expansion to sports programming.
In 1998, ABS-CBN, through its sports division, ABS-CBN Sports, used mainly Studio 23 to highlight its own professional basketball league, the Metropolitan Basketball Association (MBA). The league adopted the home and away format used by the American professional league the National Basketball Association (NBA). (It however sold the franchise of the league after incurring heavy losses.) It marked the network's first serious foray into sports programming.
Later, that would be added by acquiring broadcast rights to the collegiate leagues UAAP and NCAA and the PBL.
Today, it carries a wide variety of local sporting competition, many of which involved neighborhood schools and showcasing budding Filipino sports talents.
2010-2014: Part of ABS-CBN, rebranded as Studio 23 Network.
The date was brought forward and AMCARA Broadcasting Network officially purchased by ABS-CBN ended on March 22, 2010.
On 12 July 2010, ABS-CBN announced the formation of its broadcast television subsidiary, officially named Studio 23 Network. The AMCARA name will be cease to be used as a terrestrial broadcaster as well as blocktimer agreement, though existing AMCARA Broadcasting Network studios will keep the name. AMCARA Broadcasting Network was officially shut down on October 22, 2010.
On October 23, 2010, ABS-CBN officially announced that the integration of their UHF TV network operations as well as AMCARA Broadcasting Network has been completed and the two entities will merge into one under the name of Studio 23 Network and will operate under the business name of Studio 23, Inc.
On January 16, 2014, Studio 23 ceased its commercial broadcast and rebranded as ABS-CBN Sports and Action on January 18, 2014.
2014-present: Studio 23 goes off the air and rebranded as ABS-CBN Sports and Action.
ABS-CBN Sports and Action, stylized as ABS-CBN Sports+Action, is a Filipino free-to-air sports and action channel. It is managed by ABS-CBN Sports, ABS-CBN Corporation's sports content division. The channel occupied the former channel space of Studio 23, a young adult-oriented network ceasing operations on January 16, 2014. It began its operations on January 18, 2014.

<doc id="9800202" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9800202" title="WJZB-TV">
WJZB-TV

WJZB-TV, UHF analog channel 14, was a television station located in Worcester, Massachusetts, United States. The station existed from 1953 to 1969.
History.
The station first signed on the air in December 1953 as WWOR-TV (no relation to the current New York City station that is licensed to Secaucus, New Jersey), operating as the second independent station in the Boston area. The station's transmitter was located on Asnebumskit Hill in Paxton. It also carried secondary affiliations with ABC and DuMont, and also cleared whatever NBC programs that WBZ-TV (channel 4, now a CBS owned-and-operated station) declined to air. Unfortunately, WWOR had signed on just after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) opened the UHF band for broadcasting use, and television manufacturers were not required to include UHF tuning capability (the FCC later passed the All-Channel Receiver Act in 1961, with UHF tuners beginning to be included on all newer sets as a result of its implementation by 1964). Even with an expensive converter, WWOR's signal was marginal at best. No one was willing to advertise on a station that was barely viewable, and channel 14 went dark in 1955.
In 1958, WWOR's owners, Salisbury Broadcasting, merged with Springfield Television Corporation, owner of WWLP-TV in Springfield. The station returned to the air as a satellite of WWLP. It was only on the air for six hours a day to protect WBZ-TV. After six years, Springfield Television decided to turn channel 14 into a Boston-focused independent station once again, under new call letters, WJZB (named for WWLP staffer John Z. Buckley). In the 1960s, it began airing Boston Bruins and Boston Celtics games (from WHDH-TV in Boston), and also aired classic movies, syndicated sports programs, travelogues and other standard independent fare. It also retained a part-time NBC affiliation.
With a terrestrial footprint that covered Boston, Providence and eastern Connecticut, the station appeared to be on strong footing. However, the channel 14 transmitter was not capable of broadcasting in color. The station's fate was sealed in 1966, when two major events occurred: first, Storer Broadcasting bought struggling independent WIHS-TV (channel 38) and changed its call letters to WSBK-TV. Secondly, a joint venture of Kaiser Broadcasting and the "Boston Globe" purchased WXHR-TV (channel 56, formerly WTAO-TV; now WLVI), which had been off the air for a decade, and returned the station to the air that December. WJZB limped along for another year, until Springfield Television cut the station's operations back to 90 minutes a day, the minimum required to retain the license. The station signed on at 6 p.m. and signed off at 7:30 p.m., its sole programs being WWLP's evening newscasts and "The Huntley-Brinkley Report".
In 1969, Springfield Television sold WJZB to Buckley and his new corporation, Evans Broadcasting. Buckley planned significant upgrades, including a new color transmitter capable of 1 million watts of power. However, the studio and transmitter were destroyed by fire in the spring of 1969. The station never returned to the air, and Buckley returned the license to the FCC, which deleted it in 1971.

Turkish nationalism

Turkish nationalism is a political ideology that promotes and glorifies the Turkish people, as either a national, ethnic, or linguistic group.
Pan-Turkism.
Turkic nationalism began with the Turanian Society founded in 1839, followed in 1908 with the Turkish Society, which later expanded into the Turkish Hearth and eventually expanded to include ideologies such as Pan-Turanism and Pan-Turkism.
Turkish nationalism.
The Young Turk revolution which overthrew Sultan Abdul Hamid II, allowed Turkish nationalism into power, eventually leading to the Three Pashas control of the late Ottoman government.
During the Turkish War of Independence, Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk) rejected the political Pan Turkism and said in BMM on December 1, 1921 as follows:
"... We never established Pan-Islamism. Perhaps we said "We are establishing it and we shall complete it." Our enemies said "Let us kill them before they complete it." We never established Pan-Turanism. Perhaps we said "We are establishing it and we shall complete it." Our enemies said, "Let us kill them before they complete it." That is the whole problem, instead of bringing pressure and resentment upon ourselves from our enemies... Let us know our places!'
After the Fall of the Ottoman Empire, Mustafa Kemal came to power. Atatürk spoke positively about the Pan-Turkic view and he wanted to forge closer relationships with other Turkish states in Central Asia and the West. Atatürk introduced Hilaire de Barenton's Sun Language Theory into Turkish political and educational circles in 1935, at the high point of attempts to "cleanse" the Turkish language of foreign influence. Turkish researchers at the time also came up with the idea that Early Sumerians were proto-Turks.
Anatolianism.
Anatolianism (Turkish: "Anadoluculuk") is a kind of Turkish nationalist thought. The starting point of this thought is that the main source of Turkish culture and civilization should be Anatolia ("Anadolu"), and the main base of this thought is that the Turkish people had built a quite new civilization in Anatolia after 1071 when they won at the Battle of Manzikert. In the early republic era, some intellectuals proposed that the origins of the Turkish nationalism should be sought in Anatolia, not in Turan.
Hilmi Ziya Ülken, one of the founders of Anatolianism, was against the Ottomanism, Islamism and Turanism. Between 1918 and 1919 he published the periodical "Anadolu" with Reşat Kayı. In 1919 Ülken wote a book titled "Anadolunun Bugünki Vazifeleri" (Present duties of Anatolia), but it was not published. In 1923, Ülken and his friends published the periodical "Anadolu". They worked to form an alternative thought to Ottomanism, Islamism and Turanism, and they opposed the specificity of Turkish history traced origins outside of Anatolia. Their conclusion was "Memleketçilik". "Memleket" means "Homeland" or "Fatherland" (or even simply "home town"), so roughly, the translation would be "Homelandism".
Modern Turkish nationalism.
Article 301 of the Turkish penal code, which is perceived as being contrary to notion of freedom of speech, states ""The person who publicly denigrates the Turkish Nation, the Republic of Turkey, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, the Government of the Republic of Turkey and the judicial organs of the State, shall be punished with imprisonment of six months to two years." but also it can be only with permission of the minister of justice" However, it also states that ""Expressions of thought intended to criticize shall not constitute a crime.""
There have been recent indications that Turkey may abandon or modify Article 301, after the embarrassment suffered by some high profile cases. Nationalists within the judicial system, intent on derailing Turkey's full admission into the European Union, have used Article 301 to initiate trials against people like Nobel-prize-winning Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk, the Turkish novelist Elif Şafak, and the late Hrant Dink for supporting the theories of the Armenian Genocide.
In May 2007, a law was put into effect allowing Turkey to block Web sites that are deemed insulting to Atatürk.

Shader lamps

Shader lamps is a computer graphic technique used to change the appearance of physical objects. The still or moving objects are illuminated, using one or more video projectors, by static or animated texture or video stream. The method was invented at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill by Ramesh Raskar, Greg Welch, Kok-lim Low and Deepak Bandyopadhyay in 1999 as a follow on to Spatial Augmented Reality [http://en.scientificcommons.org/42668071 also invented at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1998 by Ramesh Raskar, Greg Welch and Henry Fuchs.
A 3D graphic rendering software is typically used to compute the deformation caused by the non perpendicular, non-planar or even complex projection surface.
Complex objects (or aggregation of multiple simple objects) create self shadows that must be compensated by using several projectors.
The objects are typically replaced by neutral color ones, the projection giving all its visual properties, thus the name shader lamps.
The technique can be used to create a sense of invisibility, by rendering transparency. The object is illuminated not by a replacement of its own visual properties, but by the corresponding visual surface placed behind the object as seen from an arbitrary viewing point.

Alex Compton

Alexander M. Compton (born March 16, 1974) is a retired Filipino-born American basketball player who had several stints in professional Philippine basketball leagues, either as player or assistant coach. He is now the national tournament director of the Nokia National Basketball Training Center Developmental League, the grassroots program of the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas.
Born in Makati City in the Philippines, Compton and his family spent a year in northeastern Thailand when he was ten years old. His parents, both Southeast Asian Studies scholars, were researchers there.
Compton moved to Madison from upstate New York in 1988, when his parents began working at the University of Wisconsin. Compton was a starting guard on the 1992 Madison West High School basketball squad. There he teamed up with Mike Dammen to lead the school's only state championship team since 1945.
Although he dreamed of playing in a foreign league, Compton had no clue how to get to one until his junior year at Cornell. When a coach heard Compton was born in the Philippines, he told Compton that he could play on a team in the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). Compton found an agent, who arranged for him to join a team in July 1997, after graduation.
Compton played four seasons in the defunct Metropolitan Basketball Association with the Manila Metrostars and the Batangas Blades. He won the 1999 MBA Most Valuable Player award when the Metrostars won the national title, and won another championship with the Blades in 2001.
By the time the MBA folded in 2002, Compton was a fixture in Philippine basketball and fully assimilated into the culture. However, he still could not play in the PBA due to the league's eligibility rules, which do not allow naturalized Filipino citizens to play. Instead, he appeared on television as a basketball analyst. Compton also got an exception from the Philippine Basketball League. He played for the Sunkist-UST Tigers and the Montaña Pawnshop Jewels from 2002–2006. He led the Jewels to its only PBL crown in the 2005 PBL Open Championship.
In the 2006-07 PBA Philippine Cup, Compton was hired as one of the assistant coaches of the Dragons before being allowed by the PBA to play as the team's second import for the 2007 and 2008 PBA Fiesta Conference; it was his only PBA appearance as a player. He was elevated to the assistant head coaching position with the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters from 2006 to 2009.
Currently, he is the head coach of Alaska Aces in the PBA after Luigi Trillo resigned due to family reasons.

Edward H. Shortliffe

Edward ("Ted") Hance Shortliffe (born 1947) is a Canadian-born American biomedical informatician, physician, and computer scientist. Shortliffe is a pioneer in the use of artificial intelligence in medicine. He was the principal developer of the clinical expert system MYCIN, one of the first rule-based artificial intelligence expert systems, which obtained clinical data interactively from a physician user and was used to diagnose and recommend treatment for severe infections. While never used in practice (because it preceded the era of local-area networking and could not be integrated with patient records and physician workflow), its performance was shown to be comparable to and sometimes more accurate than that of Stanford infectious disease faculty. This spurred the development of a wide range of activity in the development of rule-based expert systems, knowledge representation, belief nets and other areas, and its design greatly influenced the subsequent development of computing in medicine.
He is also regarded as a founder of the field of biomedical informatics, and in 2006 received one of its highest honors, the Morris F. Collen Award given by the American College of Medical Informatics.
He has held administrative positions in academic medicine, research and national bodies including the Institute of Medicine, American College of Physicians, the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and National Library of Medicine (NLM), and been influential in the development of medicine, computing and biomedical informatics nationally and internationally. His interests include the broad range of issues related to integrated medical decision-support systems and their implementation, biomedical informatics and medical education and training, and the Internet in medicine.
In March 2007, he became founding dean of the University of Arizona's new College of Medicine campus in Phoenix. He stepped down from this position in May 2008 and in January 2009 transferred his primary academic appointment to Arizona State University where he became professor of biomedical informatics. He maintained a secondary appointment as professor of basic medical sciences and of medicine at the University of Arizona College of Medicine (Phoenix Campus). In November 2009 he transferred his academic home to a part-time appointment as professor at the School of Biomedical Informatics, University of Texas Health Science Center at the Texas Medical Center in Houston, where he lived until November 2011. Since that time he has returned to New York City where he continues as an adjunct professor of biomedical informatics at Columbia University.
In July 2009, Shortliffe assumed a position as president and chief executive officer of the American Medical Informatics Association, an organization that he helped to form between 1988 and 1990 when he was President of the Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care. In late 2011 he announced his intention to step down from this position in 2012.
Biography and career.
Shortliffe grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, until his family moved to Connecticut when he was 6. He attended the Loomis School in Connecticut (now Loommis-Chaeffee School) and later Gresham's School in the United Kingdom. His father was a physician and hospital administrator; his mother, an English teacher. He has one brother and one sister.
As an undergraduate at Harvard, he started working in the computer laboratory of G. Octo Barnett at Massachusetts General Hospital and realized that he could have a career spanning both medicine and computing.
After receiving an AB in applied mathematics "magna cum laude" from Harvard College in 1970, he received an M.D. (1976) and Ph.D. in Medical Information Systems (1975) from Stanford University, with a dissertation on the MYCIN system, for which he also won the 1976 Grace Murray Hopper Award for outstanding computer scientists under the age of 30. He completed internal medicine house-staff training from 1976-1979 at Massachusetts General Hospital and Stanford Hospital. In 1979 he joined the Stanford faculty in internal medicine and computer science, where he directed the Stanford University Medical EXpertimental computer resource (SUMEX) and subsequently the Center for Advanced Medical Informatics at Stanford (CAMIS), continuing his work on expert systems, including ONCOCIN (an oncology decision support program), T-HELPER, and other projects in the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project. He also simultaneously served as chief of general internal medicine and associate chair of medicine for primary care, and was principal investigator of the InterMed Collaboratory, which developed the science of computable guidelines for medical decision support.
In 1980 he founded one of the earliest formal degree programs in biomedical informatics at Stanford University, emphasizing a rigorous and experimentalist approach. From 2003-2007 he served on the Board of Directors of Medco Health Solutions, a large pharmacy benefits manager headquartered in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.
In 2000 he moved to Columbia University as chair of the department of biomedical informatics, deputy vice president (Columbia University Medical Center), senior associate dean for strategic information resources (College of Physicians and Surgeons), professor of medicine, professor of computer science, and director of medical informatics services for the New York-Presbyterian Hospital. He continued work on decision support guidelines including the development of the Guideline Interchange Format (GLIF3).
From March 2007 until May 2008 he served as the founding dean of the Phoenix campus of the University of Arizona's College of Medicine and from November 2009 to October 2011 he served as professor in the School of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in Houston, Texas. He has served as president and chief executive officer of the American Medical Informatics Association from 2009-2012 and continues to hold adjunct faculty appointments in biomedical informatics at Columbia University and Arizona State University.
Advisory activities.
At age 39, Shortliffe was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the United States National Academy of Sciences (where he has served on the IOM executive council). He is also an elected member or fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence, American Society for Clinical Investigation, the Association of American Physicians, and the American Clinical and Climatological Association.
He is a founding member of the American Medical Informatics Association and was one of five founding fellows of the American College of Medical Informatics. He is a master of the American College of Physicians and was a member of that organization's Board of Regents from 1996-2002. He is editor-in-chief of the "Journal of Biomedical Informatics" and serves on the editorial boards for several other biomedical informatics publications.
He has served on the oversight committee for the Division of Engineering and Physical Sciences (National Academy of Sciences) and the Biomedical Informatics Expert Panel (National Center for Research Resources at the National Institutes of Health).

Helen Douglas Mankin

Helen Douglas Mankin (1896–1956) was an American politician; she was the second woman to represent Georgia in the United States House of Representatives.
Mankin was born September 11, 1896, in Atlanta, Fulton County, Georgia. She grew up there, attending public and private schools. She graduated with an A.B. from Rockford College, Rockford, Illinois, in 1917. She graduated with an LL.B. from Atlanta Law School, Atlanta, Georgia, in 1920. During and after the First World War, Mankin served as an ambulance driver in the American Women’s Hospital Unit No. 1, a Red Cross unit attached to the French army in 1918 and 1919. She was there as a civilian and was not officially a military veteran.
After the war and earning her law degree, Mankin entered private practice as an attorney in Atlanta, Georgia. She entered politics, and served as a Democratic member of the Georgia General Assembly from 1937 until 1946.
In 1946, Mankin was elected as a Democrat to represent the fifth congressional district of Georgia in the 79th United States Congress, filling the seat left vacant by the resignation of Robert Ramspeck. She took her seat February 12, 1946. She was an unsuccessful candidate in that year's Democratic Party primary election when she sought renomination to run for reelection. She won the popular vote, gaining major support from Atlanta's African-American community, but lost in the county unit system, a voting system similar to the presidential electoral college that Georgia then used for primary elections. The county-unit system gave disproportionate weight to the votes of rural counties, severely discounting the votes of large urban areas, such as Atlanta's Fulton County. Mankin then was an unsuccessful write-in candidate in the general election of 1946. 
Mankin's term of office concluded January 3, 1947. She continued to live in Atlanta, and she died there on July 25, 1956.

<doc id="9800419" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9800419" title="Anacaona">
Anacaona

Anacaona (; ) was a Taíno "cacica" (chief), sister of Bohechío, chief of Xaragua, and wife of Caonabo, chief of the nearby territory of Maguana. Her brother and her husband were two of the five highest "caciques" who ruled the island of "Ayiti" (now called Hispaniola) when the Spaniards settled there in 1492. She was celebrated as a composer of ballads and narrative poems, called "areítos".
Life.
Anacaona was born in Yaguana (today the town of Léogane, Haiti) in 1474. During Christopher Columbus's visit to the chiefdom of Xaragua in what is now southwest Haiti in late 1496, Anacaona and her brother Bohechío appeared as equal negotiators. On that occasion, described by Bartolomé de las Casas in "Historia de las Indias", Columbus successfully negotiated for tribute of food and cotton to be paid by the natives to the Spanish invaders under his command.
The visit is described as having taken place in a friendly atmosphere. Several months later, Columbus arrived with a caravel to collect a part of the tribute. Anacaona and Behechío had sailed briefly aboard the caravel, near today's Port-au-Prince in the Gulf of Gonâve as his guests. At first relations between natives and Conquistadors were cordial, the natives realized too late their lands were actually being stolen and their subjects enslaved. A model later repeated in Mexico with Moctezuma II because of its original Caribbean success.
Anacaona's high status was probably strengthened by elements of matrilineal descent in the Taíno society, as described by Peter Martyr d'Anghiera. Taíno caciques usually passed inheritance to the eldest children of their sisters. If their sisters had no children, then they chose among the children of their brothers, and when there were none, they fell back upon one of their own.
Anacaona had one child, named Higuemota, whose dates of birth and death are lost to history.
Arrest and death.
Anacaona became chief of Xaragua after her brother's death. Her husband Caonabo, suspected of having organized the attack on La Navidad (a Spanish settlement on northern Hispaniola), was captured by Alonso de Ojeda and shipped to Spain, dying in a shipwreck during the journey - as many other Taino leaders died on Spanish ships away from their native lands. The Taínos, being ill-treated by the conquerors, revolted and made a long war against them.
During a feast organized by 84 regional chieftains to honor Anacaona, who was friendly to the Spaniards, the Spanish Governor Nicolás de Ovando ordered the meeting house to be set on fire to burn them alive. Similar to what centuries later occurred to Rigoberta Manchu's family in Guatemala. Cacica Anacaona and her Taíno noblemen were arrested — all accused of conspiracy for resisting occupation and executed.
Prior to her execution, Anacaona was offered clemency if she would give herself as concubine to one of the Spaniards which was common in the era. Standing with her fellow Tainos in solidarity, the Caribbean indigenous female leader (cacica) chose execution over colluding with her Spanish enemy. Her refusal cementing her legend. In contrast with Aztec La Malinche who became mistress of Spanish Conqueror Hernan Cortes or Native American Pocahontas who married John Smith, Anacaona remained rebellious and independent until her violent public death.
Because Anacaona refused the sexual offer of the Spanish intruders while others were shot, Anacaona was executed by hanging. She was only 29 years old.
Legacy.
Her immortalization in the intertwining histories of Haiti and the Dominican Republic has resulted in the use of her name for various places in both countries. Many in Haiti claim her as a significant icon in early Haitian history and a primordial founder of their country.
Renowned Haitian American author Edwidge Danticat wrote an award-winning novel, "Anacaona: Golden Flower, Haiti, 1490", in dedication to the fallen chief, and a more recent novel has appeared about Anacaona, ""Ayiti's Taino Queen/Anacaona, La Reine Taino d'Ayiti"" by Maryse N. Roumain, PhD. She is immortalized in music by Haitian folk singers Ansy and Yolé DeRose in "Anacaona", as well as by Puerto Rican salsa composer Tite Curet Alonso in his song "Anacaona" and Irka Mateo "Anacaona".

Japanese destroyer Mutsuki

History.
Construction of the "Mutsuki"-class destroyers was authorized as part of the Imperial Japanese Navy's build up following the abandonment of the Washington Naval Treaty from fiscal 1923. The class was a follow-on to the earlier and "Kamikaze" class destroyers, with which they shared many common design characteristics. "Mutsuki", built at the Sasebo Naval Arsenal was laid down on May 21, 1924, launched on July 23, 1925 and commissioned on March 26, 1926. Originally commissioned simply as “Destroyer No. 19”, it was assigned the name "Mutsuki" on August 1, 1928.
In the late 1930s, "Mutsuki" participated in combat in China, including the First Shanghai Incident of 1932 and other actions in the Second Sino-Japanese War.
World War II history.
At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, "Mutsuki" was part of Destroyer Division 30 under Cruiser-Destroyer Squadron 6 in the IJN 4th Fleet, and deployed from Truk as part of the Wake Island invasion force. 
Early on the morning of December 11, 1941 (in what was later termed the Battle of Wake Island, the American garrison repulsed the first Japanese landing attempts by the Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces (SNLF), which was screened by the light cruisers , , and ; and destroyers with , , , "Mutsuki", , and , two old converted to patrol boats ("Patrol Boat No. 32" and "Patrol Boat No. 33"), and two troop transports containing 450 Special Naval Landing Force troops. After taking heavy losses (including "Kisaragi" and "Hayate"), the Japanese force withdrew before landing. This was the first Japanese defeat of the war, and also the only occasion in World War II when an amphibious assault was repulsed by shore-based guns. "Mutsuki" returned on December 23 with the second Wake Island invasion force, and carried a SNLF advance landing party.
In early 1942, "Mutsuki" escorted a troop convoy from Truk to Guam, and then joined the invasion of the Solomon Islands, covering the landings of Japanese forces during ”Operation R” (the invasion of Rabaul, New Ireland and New Britain), and during ”Operation SR” (the invasion of Lae and Salamaua on New Guinea), and in April, covering landings on the Admiralty Islands.
During the Battle of the Coral Sea from May 7–8, 1942, "Mutsuki" was assigned to the “Operation Mo” invasion force for Port Moresby. After that operation was cancelled, "Mutsuki" remained based out of Rabaul, escorting shipping between Truk, Rabaul and Palau until recalled to Japan in July for refitting.
After repairs were completed at Sasebo Naval Arsenal on July 12, 1942, "Mutsuki" was reassigned to the IJN 8th Fleet and participated in the bombardment of Henderson Field on August 24, 1942. During the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on August 25, 1942, "Mutsuki" was sunk in an attack by USAAF B-17 Flying Fortress bombers while assisting the damaged transport "Kinryu maru", northeast of Santa Isabel island. "Mutsuki" took a direct bomb hit in its engineering section, killing 41 crewmen and injuring 11 more. "Yayoi" took on the survivors, which included her captain, Lt. Cdr. Kenji Hatano.
"Mutsuki" was struck from the navy list on October 1, 1942.

Fires on the Plain (film)

"Fires on the Plain" follows a tubercular Japanese private and his attempt to stay alive during the latter part of World War II. Kon Ichikawa has noted its thematic struggle between staying alive, and crossing the ultimate low.
Plot.
In February 1945, the demoralized Imperial Japanese Army on Leyte is in desperate straits, cut off from support and supplies by the Allies, who are in the process of liberating the Philippine island. Private Tamura has tuberculosis and is seen as a useless burden to his company, even though it has been reduced to little more than a platoon in strength. He is ordered to commit suicide if he is unable to get admitted to a field hospital. A sympathetic soldier gives him several yams from the unit's meager supplies.
On his way, he notices a mysterious fire on the ground. When he reaches the crowded hospital, he is judged not sick enough to treat. He joins a group of other rejectees outside. When the Allies start shelling the area, the medical staff abandon the patients and run away. The hospital is hit and destroyed. Tamura flees as well; looking back, he sees many bodies strewn around, but chooses not to go to the aid of any who may still be alive.
Traveling alone, Tamura discovers a deserted village on the coast, where he finds a pile of dead Japanese soldiers. As he searches for food, a young Filipino couple arrive by canoe and run to a hut to retrieve a cache of precious salt hidden under a floorboard. When Tamura enters the hut, the girl begins to scream. Tamura tries to placate them by lowering his rifle, but she continues to scream. He shoots her. The young man escapes in his canoe. Tamura takes the salt and leaves.
He next encounters three Japanese soldiers. They sight another fire. Tamura believes they are signal fires, but one of the others tells him that farmers are just burning corn husks. The squad leader mentions that the army has been ordered to go to Palompon for evacuation to Cebu. Tamura asks to accompany them. When one soldier notices Tamura's full bag, he shares his salt.
They soon join a stream of ragged, malnourished, dejected soldiers heading to Palompon. Among them are Nagamatsu and Yasuda, familiar men from Tamura's company. Yasuda, wounded in the leg, has Nagamatsu try to trade tobacco for food. When the soldiers come to a heavily traveled road, they decide to wait for night before trying to cross, but they are ambushed by the waiting Americans. The few survivors flee back the way they came.
Later, an American jeep arrives. Tamura prepares to surrender, but gives up the idea when he sees a Filipino woman gun down a fellow Japanese trying the same thing. The accompanying American soldiers are too late to stop her.
Tamura wanders aimlessly. He comes across a crazed, exhausted soldier, who tells Tamura he can eat his body after he is dead. Tamura hastily departs.
He comes across Nagamatsu and Yasuda again. They claim to have survived on "monkey meat" and are living in the forest. Later, Nagamatsu goes out to hunt more "monkeys". When Tamura mentions he has a grenade (given to him to commit suicide), Yasuda steals it. Tamura leaves to find Nagamatsu. When Nagamatsu almost shoots him, he realizes what monkey meat really is. Nagamatsu tells Tamura they would be dead if they did not resort to cannibalism.
They head back to camp, but when Tamura mentions that Yasuda has his grenade, Nagamatsu says they will have to kill him, or he will do them in with the grenade. However, Yasuda is too wary. A standoff ensues. Nagamatsu stakes out the only source of water in the area. After several days, Yasuda tries to bargain, to no avail. Finally, he makes his way to the water and is shot. Nagamatsu begins butchering the body for meat. Tamura becomes disgusted and shoots Nagamatsu.
Tamura then heads towards the "fires on the plains", desperate to find someone "who is leading a normal life." He slowly walks forward, even as the Filipinos shoot at him. The film ends with Tamura collapsing on the ground, his fate ambiguous.
Production.
Kon Ichikawa stated in a Criterion Collection interview that he had witnessed the destruction of the atom bomb first hand, and had felt since then that he had to speak out against the horrors of war, despite the many comedies that made up most of his early career. "Fires on the Plain" got greenlighted by the studio Daiei, because they thought it would be an action movie. Ichikawa decided that it was a film that needed to be made in black and white, specifically requesting Eastman's black and white. The studio initially balked, but after a month of arguing, the studio agreed to Ichikawa's request. Ichikawa also said that he had wanted actor Eiji Funakoshi to be in the film from the beginning. Ichikawa's wife, Natto Wada, penned the script which got the approval of novel author Shohei Ooka.
The film was shot entirely in Japan in Gotenba, Izu and Hakone. The actors were fed little and were not allowed to brush their teeth or cut their nails to make it look more realistic, but doctors were on set constantly. It was delayed for two months when Eiji Funakoshi fainted on the set. When Ichikawa asked Funakoshi's wife what had happened, she responded that he had barely eaten in the two months that he was given to prepare.
Mickey Curtis said, also in a Criterion Collection interview, that he did not think he was a good actor, but Ichikawa said he just needed to act naturally. Ichikawa had heard that Curtis was very thin, so he decided to use him, as the characters in the story have eaten very little. Ichikawa specifically told each actor how he wanted them to react, and would not rehearse. Ichikawa expressed that the narrator (Tamura) could not be a cannibal because then he would have crossed the ultimate low. Ichikawa consulted with his wife, Natto Wada, and they decided against having him eat human flesh. As a result, Tamura never eats any in the film because his teeth are falling out.
Distribution.
"Fires on the Plain" was released November 3, 1959 in Japan. It was later released on June 6, 2000 by Homevision. Then it was released as part of the Criterion Collection on March 13, 2007. The disc includes a video interview with Kon Ichikawa and Mickey Curtis. Also included is a video introduction with Japanese film scholar Donald Richie and a booklet with an essay on "Fires on the Plain" by Chuck Stephens. The film was digitally restored from a Spirit DataCine 35 mm composite fine-grain master positive print. The sound was restored from a 35 mm optical soundtrack. It was co-released by the Criterion Collection with another Ichikawa film, "The Burmese Harp".
Reception.
In its early release in the United States, many American critics dismissed "Fires on the Plain" as a gratuitously bleak anti-war film. In 1963, "The New York Times" film critic Bosley Crowther gave the film a quite harsh description, writing "Never have I seen a more grisly and physically repulsive film than 'Fires on the Plain.'" He continued, "So purposefully putrid is it, so full of degradation and death... that I doubt if anyone can sit through it without becoming a little bit ill... That's how horrible it is." He notes however, "this is a tribute to its maker, for it is perfectly obvious to me that Kon Ichikawa, the director, intended it to be a brutally realistic contemplation of one aspect of war." He points out, "...with all the horror in it, there are snatches of poetry, too..." He ends the review commenting that the only audience who would enjoy the film were those with bitter memories towards the Japanese held over from World War II.
A 1961 "Variety" review also cautioned that the films bleakness made it a difficult film to promote to audiences, commenting that it "goes much farther than the accepted war masterpieces in detailing for humanity in crisis." "Variety"'s review is more positive than the "New York Times", calling it, "one of the most searing pacifistic comments on war yet made... it is a bone hard, forthright film. It is thus a difficult vehicle but one that should find its place."
Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader said: "No other film on the horrors of war has gone anywhere near as far as Kon Ichikawa's 1959 Japanese feature." John Monogahn of the "Detroit Free Press" compared it to Clint Eastwood's "Letters from Iwo Jima". The film is not without criticism however, and many Japanese critics dislike Ichikawa's work.
In response to the recent Criterion collection release, Jamie S. Rich of DVD Talk review, had the following to say about it: "I wouldn't call Kon Ichikawa's Fires on the Plain – Criterion Collection an anti-war film so much as I'd call it a realist's war film. Rather than build his story around big explosions and the thrill of battle, Ichikawa instead brings the human drama front and center, directing his spotlight on a soldier who is left to his own devices when the guns stop blazing. He poses the question, 'When stranded on the bombed-out landscape after the fighting has calmed, what will those left behind do to survive?' It's bleak and it's chilling, and yet "Fires on the Plain" is also completely engrossing. It's the post-action picture as morality play, the journey of the individual recast with Dante-esque overtones. Ichikawa doesn't have to hit you over the head with a message because the story is so truthfully crafted, to state the message outright would be redundant. Once you've seen Fires on the Plain, the movie will get under your skin, and you'll find it impossible to forget."
Awards.
In 1960, the film won the Blue Ribbon Awards for Best Director and Best Cinematography, the Kinema Junpo Awards for Best Screenplay and Best Actor (Eiji Funakoshi) and the Mainichi Film Concours for Best Actor (Eiji Funakoshi), all three in Tokyo.
In 1961 it also won the Golden Sail at the Locarno International Film Festival. The film was also selected as the Japanese entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 32nd Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.
Themes.
Symbolism.
Donald Richie has written that "Fires on the Plain" is in contrast to Ichikawa's earlier "The Burmese Harp" as it "could be considered conciliatory" whereas "Fires on the Plain" is "deliberately confrontational". Alexander Jacoby has written: "The Burmese Harp and Fires on the Plain differ in approach – the one sentimental, the other visceral, rather in the manner of the American Vietnam movie of later years. The comparison is telling: just as Hollywood has largely failed to deal with the politics of US involvement in Vietnam, preferring to focus on the individual sufferings on American soldiers, so Ichikawa's war films make only a token acknowledgement of wartime atrocities committed by the Japanese, and largely buy into assumptions of Japanese victimhood in World War II – assumptions which to this day remain too widespread in the country." He has further written that, like Tamura, many of Ichikawa's characters are loners.
Ichikawa has been called a cinematic entomologist because he "studies, dissects and manipulates" his human characters. Max Tessier calls "Fires on the Plain" the summit of this tendency in Ichikawa's work, and "one of the blackest films ever made." Tessier continues that by criticizing the loss of humanity which war causes, the film remains humanist. James Quandt calls Ichikawa a materialist, noting that he represents abstract concepts in simple objects. In "Fires on the Plain", life and death are carried by Tamura in the objects of salt and a grenade respectively.
Christianity.
Audie Bock points out that in the novel the narrator is in Japan with a Christian view of life, while the film ends with Tamura walking, hands up into gunfire. When first shown in London, critics complained about this changed ending. By ending with the hero in a hospital meditating on the past, the novel implied a faith in man and the possibility of progress. However Ichikawa's film rejects faith. Tamura puts his faith in man by walking towards the villagers, and he is shot. The individual Tamura may be purified at the end of the film, but the world and mankind are not.
Asked about the controversial change in ending, in which the narrator apparently dies rather than survive, Ichikawa replied, "I let him die... I thought he should rest peacefully in the world of death. The death was my salvation for him." Further, the main character in the film does not have the Christian outlook that narrator of the novel has. Ichikawa explained, "...it somehow didn't seem plausible to show a Japanese soldier saying 'Amen'."
Degradation.
Some critics have seen in Fires on the Plain themes of degradation and brutality. Ichikawa has said that things the characters do, such as cannibalism, are such low acts, that if the protagonist, Tamura did them, he would've crossed such a low that he'd be unredeemable and Ichikawa commented that "Fires on the Plain" is his attempt to show ""the limits in which moral existence is possible." Others, such as Chuck Stephens, note that Ichikawa occasionally mixes black humour and degradation, like in a scene where Soldiers exchange boots, each getting a better pair, until when Tamura looks down at the boots, they are completely soleless.
Film critic Chuck Stephens, in his essay "Both Ends Burning" for the Criterion Collection release of "Fires on the Plain", said the following about Ichikawa : "At once a consummate professional and commercially successful studio team player and an idiosyncratic artist whose bravest films-often displaying a thoroughly odd obsession (to borrow the title of one of his most brilliantly sardonic black comedies) with fusing the brightest and bleakest aspects of human nature-were passionately personal (if not political or polemical) prefigurations of the Japanese new wave, has always had a gift for crystallizing contradition."
The black humor employed by Ichikawa has also often been the subject of comment by others. It has been claimed that Eiji Funakoshi was fundamentally a comic actor. The noted Japanese film critic Tadao Sato points out that Funakoshi does not play his role in "Fires on the Plain" in the usual style of post-World War II anti-war Japanese films. He does not put on the pained facial expression and the strained walk typical of the genre, but instead staggers confused through the film more like a drunk man. Sato says that this gives the film its black-comic style which results from watching a man trying to maintain his human dignity in a situation which makes this impossible. Quandt notes that Ichikawa's wife, Natto Wada, wrote the script to the film and contributed this sardonic wit. Audie Bock says that this black humor, rather than relieving the bleakness of the film, has the effect of actually heightening the darkness.

David Iglesias (attorney)

David Claudio Iglesias (born 1958) is an American attorney from Albuquerque, New Mexico.
He was appointed by President George W. Bush as the United States Attorney for the District of New Mexico in August 2001 and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in October 2001. He served for 6 years. He was one of eight U.S. attorneys fired by the Bush administration in 2006 for "performance-related issues." (see Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy). All U.S. Attorneys serve at the pleasure of the president. Iglesias had received a positive performance review before he was fired. A review of the matter released by the US Department of Justice Inspector General in October 2008 found that his firing had been politically motivated.
Allen Weh, chairman of the New Mexico Republican Party, complained in 2005 about then-U.S. Attorney Iglesias to a White House aide for Karl Rove, asking that Iglesias be removed. Weh was dissatisfied with Iglesias due in part to his failure to indict New Mexico State Senator Manny Aragon on fraud and conspiracy charges. Iglesias claimed in his testimony before Congress in March 2007 that Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M. both made calls urging him to rush indictments against Aragon prior to Election Day in November, 2006, even though Aragon was running unopposed in the election. [http://www.bernco.gov/upload/images/clerk/past_elections/pr_062004.html]. Three weeks after Iglesias was dismissed, his replacement, Acting U.S. Attorney Larry Gomez brought a 26 count felony indictment against Aragon. In a plea bargain, Aragon pled guilty to three felony fraud counts. Weh followed up with, "There’s nothing we’ve done that's wrong. It wasn’t that Iglesias wasn’t looking out for Republicans. He just wasn’t doing his job, period.” 
On January 22, 2009, as a member of the US Naval Reserve Judge Advocate General's Corps, Iglesias was reactivated as part of a special prosecution team for Guantanamo detainees. Asked on KRQE.com about the unlikelihood of being named to a frontline job in the war on terror, after being fired as a US Attorney, Iglesias allowed: "It's been very ironic."
Early life.
Born in Panama City, Panama to Baptist missionaries, his mother, Margaret Geiger, is a German-American, and his father, Claudio Iglesias, was a Kuna-Panamanian. His mother and father raised him on a small island off the coast of Panama where they were building a church, and doing medical, dental, and linguistic work for the Kuna people, documenting the Kuna language. After Panama his family moved first to Newkirk, Oklahoma (1964 to 1970), and then to Gallup, New Mexico. Moving again, he graduated from Santa Fe High School, in Santa Fe, New Mexico (1976). He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois (1980), and a Juris Doctor from the University of New Mexico School of Law (1984).
He served on active duty in the United States Navy, and is a mobilized member of the U.S. Naval Reserve. While in the navy, from 1985 and 1988, he was a Judge Advocate (JAG), at the Pentagon and Naval Legal Service Office, in Washington, D.C., at the Washington Navy Yard. In 1986, he was one of the members of the legal team that was the inspiration for the film "A Few Good Men", with Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson, a case involving the assault of a fellow Marine at their base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
A political independent during his college years, he became a Republican while in the Navy. His core ideals line up better with the Republican party. Iglesias in an interview with Tavis Smiley, said that he was for: "smaller government, less taxes, personal responsibility, and government restraint." He added, "Only problem is, our leaders haven't been practicing that. We've outspent the Democrats for the past eight years. So there's a difference between the ideals, which I love, and the actual application, which I don't love."
In 1995 he was a member of the White House Fellowship program, as a Special Assistant to the Secretary of Transportation. He was a state Assistant Attorney General (Special Prosecutions; defending police officers in civil rights cases) for the state of New Mexico from 1988 to 1991. From 1991-1993, he was an assistant city attorney for the city of Albuquerque. He went back to the state of New Mexico, first for the State Risk Management Legal Office (1995 to 1998) as Chief Counsel, and the Taxation and Revenue Department, General Counsel (1998 to 2001). He ran for New Mexico Attorney General as a Republican in 1998, but lost 51-49 to Democrat Patricia A. Madrid.
At the time of his appointment to U.S. Attorney, Iglesias was an associate with the law firm of Walz and Associates in Albuquerque, as well as a Commander in the U.S. Naval Reserve JAG Corps. He is currently a Captain in the Navy JAG Corps. 
In his spare time he reviews Native American films, both fictional and documentary. In 2002, he contributed an article to "Native Peoples Magazine", called "Brothers in Arms: Windtalkers".
Iglesias lives with his wife, Cynthia (Cyndy), to whom he has been married for 21 years, and their four daughters, in Albuquerque's Northeast heights. He has two older sisters, Marina and Lorie and is a practicing Evangelical Christian.
Appointment.
Iglesias was nominated by the White House on August 2, 2001 to the position of United States Attorney for the District of New Mexico.
Iglesias headed a panel that advised the U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft on matters of homeland security. While serving on the panel, he opposed pulling the National Guard away from the U.S. border with Mexico.
United States Attorney dismissal.
In October 2006 (prior to the 2006 midterm election) Senator Pete Domenici called to ask about the progress of an investigation, New Mexico U.S. Attorney Iglesias said he felt this inquiry was trying to "pressure" him to speed up indictments in a federal corruption investigation that involved State Senator Manny Aragon. When Iglesias said, he didn’t think an indictment would be issued before November, "the line went dead." Iglesias was fired one month after the election by the Bush Administration as part of the Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy. In October, Representative Heather Wilson also called about the indictments in a federal corruption investigation that also involved Aragon."
Allen Weh, chairman of the Republican Party of New Mexico, said he complained in 2005 about then-U.S. Attorney David Iglesias to a White House aide for Rove, asking that Iglesias be removed. Then in 2006 Rove personally told Weh “He’s gone,” Rove said.
One of the stated reasons for Iglesias' dismissal, by Administration officials, was dissatisfaction in his prosecution of voter-fraud cases. Nevertheless, Iglesias "had been heralded for his expertise in that area by the Justice Department, which twice selected him to train other federal prosecutors to pursue election crimes" and was "one of two chief federal prosecutors invited to teach at a 'voting integrity symposium' in October 2005… sponsored by Justice's public integrity and civil rights sections."
Iglesias said that in October 2006 he received inquiries regarding the timing of a federal probe of a kickback scheme involving local Democrats from two congressmen whom Iglesias refused to name for fear of retribution. He said that they appeared eager for there to be an indictment in time to assist the Republicans in the upcoming November election, and believed that he was ultimately fired for refusing to expedite matters. In comments to the "Albuquerque Journal" he described them as "two members of the New Mexico delegation".
The Justice Department said that part of the reason for Iglesias's dismissal was his frequent absences. In response to this charge, Iglesias stated that the reason for these absences was his mandatory 40-day per year service as part of the Navy Reserve, in which he still serves as a commander. This represents a possible violation of USERRA.
In October 2008, a report by the Department of Justice's Inspector General found that Iglesias had been wrongfully dismissed because he had refused to pursue prosecutions against the Democrat-linked community organization ACORN and a prominent New Mexico Democrat. "The real reasons for Iglesias' removal were the complaints from New Mexico Republican politicians and party activists about how Iglesias handled voter fraud and public corruption cases in the state," the report says. The Inspector General's report says that Senator Domenici's complaints were the "primary" reason Iglesias was fired.
Larry Gomez, the man who had been his assistant, took over as acting U.S. Attorney, but never received a presidential appointment to the post.
In July 2010, Department of Justice prosecutors closed the two-year investigation without filing charges after determining that the firing was inappropriately political, but not criminal, saying "Evidence did not demonstrate that any prosecutable criminal offense was committed with regard to the removal of David Iglesias. The investigative team also determined that the evidence did not warrant expanding the scope of the investigation beyond the removal of Iglesias."
Post U.S. attorney.
On the television show "Hardball with Chris Matthews" on March 22, 2007, Iglesias indicated that he was not interested in a future political career and would be more interested in a media job. In May 2008 he released with contributor Davin Seay "In Justice: Inside the Scandal That Rocked the Bush Administration". He has also been interviewing for a private sector position.
On "The Daily Show" first broadcast on June 16, 2008, Iglesias was asked about his political ideology. Host Jon Stewart pointed out that Iglesias had been a committed Republican. Stewart asked whether Iglesias' experiences made him feel disappointed and betrayed. Iglesias replied, "Yes, and to use a "Star Wars" kind of imagery, I thought I was working with the Jedi Knights, and I was working for the Sith Lords."
In 2009, Iglesias was named as an honoree to Esquire Magazine’s annual “Best and Brightest” issue for his work as a terrorism prosecutor with the Defense Department’s Office of Military Commissions.
In 2014, Iglesias was appointed Director of the J. Dennis Hastert Center at Wheaton College in Illinois.

Unity Party of Nigeria

The Unity Party of Nigeria was a Nigerian political party that was dominant in western Nigeria during the second republic. The party revolved around the political leadership of Obafemi Awolowo, a sometimes polemical politician but effective administrator. However, the party's main difference with its competitors was not the leader but the ideals of a social democracy it was founded on. The UPN as well as the PRP presented the most coherent plan of action during the electioneering campaign of 1979. The party jettisoned building a coalition of comfort in a polarized political environment but based partnerships on the cooperation of like minded advocates of democratic socialism. 
History.
The desired goal of the military government of Olusegun Obasanjo to build national political parties led to a gradual weakening of ethnic politics in the second republic. The UPN,however,inherited its ideology from the old Action Group and saw itself as a party for everyone.It was the only party to promote free education and called itself a welfarist party.

Rodney Eric Bainbridge Atkinson (born 1948) is a British eurosceptic conservative academic, political and economic commentator, journalist and author. Atkinson was formerly a lecturer at the University of Mainz, and has also worked as a merchant banker and government adviser. He is the eldest brother of comedian and actor Rowan Atkinson.
He founded The Campaign for United Kingdom Conservatism in 1994 and co-founded with Lynn Riley, the cross-party South Molton Declaration in 1999 (re-launched as the British Declaration of Independence for the 2005 election). He was Referendum Party candidate in North West Durham in the 1997 General Election (5.2%) and the lead United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) candidate for the North East Region in the 1999 European Elections (8.8%). 
In 2000, he lost the UKIP leadership election, by 16 votes, to Jeffrey Titford MEP. Atkinson left UKIP shortly afterwards, along with 200 supporters, accusing then Party Chairman Nigel Farage MEP and eurosceptic journalist Christopher Booker of conducting a “dirty tricks” campaign against him. He also accused the party of being “infiltrated by extremists”.
With Norris McWhirter, he laid misprison of treason charges against Francis Maude and Douglas Hurd for signing the Maastricht Treaty. The case was eventually quashed by the Attorney General, Nicholas Lyell, while the House of Lords was in recess, sitting in his own Judgement (as the government's lawyer) and saying there was no case to answer. Atkinson subsequently co-authored the book "Treason at Maastricht", with Norris McWhirter.

Anchetil de Greye

Anchetil de Greye was a vassal of William the Conqueror, whom he accompanied in the Norman conquest of England.
Life.
Anchetil de Greye (rendered variously in different documents, "e.g." "de Graye", "de Grei" and "Anketil") is specifically named in the Domesday Book of 1086. He was the great-grandfather of John de Gray, Bishop of Norwich, and probably also of Henry de Grey, and the great-great-grandfather of Walter de Gray, Archbishop of York and Lord Chancellor of England; and is regarded as the ancestor of all the Grey/Gray noble families in England.
The principal estate granted to Anchetil de Greye in England was called "Redrefield" (subsequently Rotherfield Greys) and the manor house, Greys Court in South Oxfordshire. Anchetil was also the mesne lord of Standlake in West Oxfordshire.
Origins.
Greye's origins in France are unclear. It is believed that there is a connection to an estate in the vicinity of today's Graye-sur-Mer (Calvados, "Graieum" 1086, "Graia" 1172, "Gray" 1183) which would have been within the domain of William. 
It is likely that Anchetil de Greye was of Viking ancestry in whole or in part since the given name "Anchetil" (from "Ásketíll" "God-Cauldron") was a fairly common Norse-origin name in Normandy. The "Greye" in his name then was either simply a reference to his estate, or to his mixed Scandinavian-Frankish ancestry which was also common in Normandy by the time of the invasion of England. His immediate ancestry is uncertain, but some researchers believe he was the son of a certain Hugh Fitz Turgis, that means "Turgis'son" (from "Thorgisl" "hostage of Thor"), another clue he was from Normandy. 
More than 20 superficially distinct instances of "Anschitil", "Anschil", "Anschetil", etc. in early Norman documents must refer to a far smaller number of distinct individuals. Particularly interesting is "Anschitil de Ros". According to "Domesday Monachorum" he was the feudal landlord, under the Bishop of Bayeux, of "Craie", another "Craie", and "Croctune" (or Crawton). These three places are in the Cray valley of Kent, which was in Norman times the foremost site of chalk mining from deneholes, on a scale rivalled only by the Hangman's Wood cluster of deneholes on the other side of the Thames in Grays.
Cray and Gray seem to be almost interchangeable in Kent place names. Cray passed from Anglo-Norman French into English as a word for "chalk", while "greye" is one of the wide range of French regional dialect words for "chalk". In Normandy, "Grai" is modern Graye-sur-Mer, and "Ros" is modern Rots, on the outskirts of Caen about away. Between them, on the river Seulles, at Orival near Creully, lies an ancient quarry where building stone is said to have been dug and lime burned since Gallo-Roman times.
Whether "Anschetil de Grai" and "Anschitil de Ros" were two persons or one, they/he must have known about and profited from the digging and shipping of limestone in Normandy, so it is at least curious that they/he picked chalk-digging areas for their new feudal lands in England.

C. Y. Lee (author)

Chin Yang Lee (; born December 23, 1917 ) is a Chinese American author best known for his 1957 novel "The Flower Drum Song", which inspired the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical "Flower Drum Song" and writer for his 2006 film "10,000 Apologies" with May Wang.
Biography.
Lee was born 1917 in Hunan, China, into a family of artists and scholars. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Xi'nan University, then emigrated to the United States of America in 1943 and earned a Master of Fine Arts degree in playwriting from Yale University in 1947. He was a contributor to Radio Free Asia. Lee was a journalist living in and working for two San Francisco Chinatown newspapers, "Chinese World" and "Young China" at the time, in the early 1950s, when he was writing "Flower Drum Song", expanding it from a short story to a novel. He currently lives in Alhambra, California.
"The Flower Drum Song".
By the 1950s, Lee was barely making a living writing short stories and working as a Chinese teacher, translator and journalist for San Francisco Chinatown newspapers. He had hoped to break into playwriting, but instead wrote a novel about Chinatown, "The Flower Drum Song" (originally titled "Grant Avenue"). Lee initially had no success selling his novel, but his agent submitted it to the publishing house of Farrar, Straus and Cudahy. The firm sent the manuscript to an elderly reader for evaluation. The reader was found dead in bed, the manuscript beside him with the words "Read this" scrawled on it. The publishing house did so, and bought Lee's novel, which became a bestseller in 1957.
The novel, about generational conflict within an Asian American family over an arranged marriage in San Francisco's Chinatown, was adapted into the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical "Flower Drum Song", opening in 1958. The original production was the first Broadway show to feature Asian American players. The 1961 film jump-started the careers of the first generation of Asian American actors, including Nancy Kwan, James Shigeta, and Jack Soo. Lee was interviewed on the 2006 DVD release of the movie.
On October 2, 2001, the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles premiered David Henry Hwang's adaptation of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Flower Drum Song" to glowing reviews, in the first major theatrical production that had an all-Asian cast of actors and voices. Its initial run was extended, and after several months, the production moved to Broadway, where the reviews were less than stellar. Lee had worked with Hwang on the rewriting of the musical.
Some observers felt that Lee's novel perpetuated Orientalist stereotypes of Asians. The novel was a New York Times bestseller, but quickly went out of print. The first ethnic studies programs in the late 1960s did not accept Lee's playful vision of mixing Chinese and American traditions. For many years the book was rejected by young Asian Americans as being "too white face" or "Uncle Tom". Lee was a Chinese immigrant and wrote of the society as he saw it at that time, perhaps an example of the very generation gap portrayed in the musical. While mainstream America had fueled Lee's initial success, the new Asian American movement's consciousness-raising had all but buried Lee's evocation of the Chinese experience in America.
More recently, however, interest in hybridization and diaspora studies has brought a new audience to Lee's work, which was clearly ahead of its time.

Short stories.
Many of Lee's short stories were published by the New Yorker magazine after the success of his first novel:

Vision document

A Vision Document is a software process document that describes the overall 'vision', or plan, for a particular piece of software. It defines the stakeholders view of the product to be developed, specified in terms of the stakeholders key needs and features. Containing an outline of the envisioned core requirements, it provides the contractual basis for the more detailed technical requirements. It is much shorter and more general than a product requirements document or a marketing requirements document, which outline the specific product plan and marketing plan respectively.
Purpose.
The Vision provides a high-level, sometimes contractual, basis for the more detailed technical requirements. It captures the "essence" of the envisaged solution in the form of high-level requirements and design constraints that give the reader an overview of the system to be developed from a behavioral requirements perspective. It provides input to the project-approval process and is, therefore, closely related to the Business case. It communicates the fundamental "why and what" for the project and is a gauge against which all future decisions should be validated.
Another name used for this artifact is the Product Requirement Document. 
A vision document generally contains:
Timing.
The Vision is created early in the Inception phase. It should evolve steadily during the earlier portion of the lifecycle, with changes slowing during Construction. It evolves in conjunction with the Business case and is meant to be revised as the understanding of requirements, architecture, plans, and technology evolves.
The Vision serves as input to use case modeling, and is updated and maintained as a separate artifact throughout the project. For agile projects, the Product Vision can feed into the user story development.

The Oaks House Museum, also known as "The Oaks", located at 823 North Jefferson Street in Jackson, Mississippi, is the former home of Jackson Mayor James H. Boyd (1809–77) and his wife Eliza Ellis Boyd and their family. Having survived the burning of Jackson during the Civil War, The Oaks is one of the oldest structures in the city. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a Mississippi Landmark.
The structure was built in the Greek Revival style in approximately 1853. The original property was larger than the current one, at one time encompassing and extending north to Boyd Street and west to North Street, an urban farmstead with main house, barn, detached kitchen, smokehouse, greenhouse, and other outbuildings. Three generations of the Boyd family lived at The Oaks, from 1853 until 1960. Mrs. Eliza Ellis Boyd outlived her husband by many years and lived in the house until her death in 1902. Daughter Mary and her husband, Richard F. McGill, lived in the house with their two children. In 1960, the grandchildren sold the property to The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in the State of Mississippi (NSCDA-MS). 
The home is now a historic house museum administered by the Oaks House Museum Corporation.

Scarlet Sister Mary

Scarlet Sister Mary is a 1928 novel by Julia Peterkin. It won the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1929. The book was called obscene and banned at the public library in Gaffney, South Carolina. "The Gaffney Ledger" newspaper, however, serially published the complete book. Dr. Richard S. Burton, the chairperson of Pulitzer's fiction-literature jury, recommended that the first prize go to the novel "Victim and Victor" by Dr.John B. Oliver. His nomination was superseded by the School of Journalism's choice of Peterkin's book. Evidently in protest, Burton resigned from the jury. 
Synopsis.
Scarlet Sister Mary is set among the Gullah people of the Low Country in South Carolina. The date is never clearly established, but appears to be around the beginning of the twentieth century. The title character, Mary, was an orphan on an abandoned plantation who was raised by Auntie Maum Hannah and her crippled son Budda Ben. The description of Mary as "Scarlet Sister" reflects the basic conflict in the novel as Mary is torn between her desire to be a member in good standing in the church and a desire to live a life of sin and pleasure.

Wail of the Banshee

Wail of the Banshee was a seven part children's fantasy drama series from 1992 broadcast on CITV, and made by Central Television.
Plot.
The Banshee of myth are based, as most legends are, on real events. Centuries ago, an alien race known as the Lamia arrived on Earth. Amoral scientists, they viewed humanity as nothing more than experimental subjects. The literal translation of their name for humans is "lab rats".
They were named Banshee because of the sound their spacecraft made. When hovering they emit a low throbbing sound akin to "baaaan-baaaan-baaaan", and when they take-off they emit a sound like a whooshing "sheeeeee". Hence the name Baaan-sheee.
The Lamia have a defensive/attack abiity which involves them emitting ultra high frequency sound from their throats, a wail which disorients and pains any humans who hear it, allowing the victims to be taken on board the ships for experimentation without resistance. It is for this reason that the 'wail of the Banshee' was associated with death, as whenever it was heard, death followed for someone nearby.

Embassy Gulf Service Station

The Embassy Gulf Service Station is a service station in Washington, D.C., located on P Street near Dupont Circle and at the entrance to the Georgetown neighborhood. Constructed in 1937, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.
History.
The station was designed in 1936 for the Gulf Oil Corporation, and was the product of company architect P. L. R. Hogner. The building and its setting were part of an aesthetic directive on the part of the company, in which it was decided to create buildings that looked less like gas stations and more like banks and libraries; consequently, the designs incorporated details, materials, and massing which were more commonly associated with such buildings.
By the time the Embassy Gulf Service Station was constructed, Gulf Oil owned sixty other stations within the city of Washington, and the new structure was part of the company's corporate expansion in the city. The siting proved somewhat difficult, however; as the building was to be built adjacent to Rock Creek Park, its design had to meet the approval of the Commission of Fine Arts; it was also the subject of a review by the National Park Service and the National Capital Park and Planning Commission. In the end, the original design had to be modified somewhat to fit the regulations put forth by the various boards. The final design called for a small building of grey stone similar in color to the church located opposite the station; whether or not the two buildings harmonized by design is unknown.
As a symbol of Gulf Oil's commitment to designing aesthetically pleasing and interesting service stations, the Embassy Gulf Service Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 30, 1993. It is still used for its original purpose; , the building serves as a repair shop and Sunoco station.

David Green (born November 13, 1941) is an American billionaire and the founder of Hobby Lobby, an American chain of arts and crafts stores.
Hobby Lobby.
In 1970 Green took a $600 loan and started a home business called Greco Products in his garage assembling and selling miniature picture frames, capitalizing on a decorating fad of the time. By August 1972 the business had thrived to such an extent that they were able to open their first store which had 300 square feet of retail space. Sons Mart and Steve started work for the company at the young ages of nine and seven, earning seven cents for every frame they glued together.
Religious views.
Green is the son of an Assemblies of God preacher and comes from a family of preachers. Green claims to have built his business squarely on biblical principles: "We're Christians, and we run our business on Christian principles." That claim is disputed by Jonathan Merritt, senior columnist for "Religion News Service".
He attributes his success to his faith in God. He has taken a public stance against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act because of its inclusion of a provision mandating that companies provide access to the morning-after pill.
Green takes half of Hobby Lobby's total pretax earnings and commits it directly to a portfolio of evangelical ministries and as of 2012 it has donated an estimated $500 million. This includes a $10.5 million gift to Jerry Falwell's Liberty University in 2004, and $70 million to bail out Oral Roberts University in 2007. He has also put nearly 1.4 billion copies of gospel literature in homes in more than 100 countries, mostly in Africa and Asia.
Green and his wife Barbara have also signed The Giving Pledge.

Royal Hours

The Royal Hours are a particularly solemn celebration of the Little Hours in the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches. The Royal Hours are celebrated only three times a year: on the Eve of the Nativity, the Eve of Theophany, and Great Friday. 
The members of the church chants verses of the bible which describes one powerful man's jealousy and fear during the service This service takes its name from the fact that it used to be officially attended by the Emperor and his court at Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. Because of the presence of the Emperor, there was a special singing of "Many Years" to the Emperor, the Imperial Court, and the Hierarchy. This singing of "Many Years" continues to this day (in modified form) in cathedrals and monasteries. By his presence, the Emperor acknowledged his submission to Christ the true King. 
The three holy days on which the Royal Hours are celebrated were chosen as days in the church year which most particularly demonstrate Jesus' "kenosis" (self-emptying), and thus His true royal majesty.
According to Sacred Tradition, the Royal Hours of Great Friday were composed by St. Cyril (378 - 444), Patriarch of Alexandria.
Although the Royal Hours are splendid, they are also penitential. On days when the Royal Hours are celebrated it is not permitted to celebrate the Divine Liturgy
The Royal Hours is an aggregate of five services, all served together as one:
For the Royal Hours, the priest vests in Epitrachelion and Phelonion, and the deacon vests fully in Sticharion, Orarion and Epimanikia. The Holy Doors and Curtain are open for most of the service, and the Gospel Book is placed on an analogion (lectern) in the center of the Temple (church). At the beginning of each Hour the priest or deacon censes the Gospel, Icons and people. 
When it is time to begin the First Hour, the bell is rung in the usual manner (blagovest). At the beginning of each of the succeeding Hours, the bell is struck the number of times that corresponds to the Hour (i.e., three times at the beginning of the Third Hour, six times at the beginning of the Sixth Hour, nine times at the beginning of the Ninth Hour). At the beginning of the Typica the bell is struck twelve times.
At each of the Hours, one of the three fixed Psalms is replaced by a Psalm that is significant to the Feast being celebrated; the Troparion and Kontakion of the day are replaced by numerous hymns chanted by the choir; and each Hour has an Old Testament reading, a Prokeimenon, and an Epistle and Gospel.
There was a service of Royal Hours for Pentecost composed by the priest Nicholas Malaxus (fl. c. 1538), and published in 1568. This service, however, has not come to wide usage in the Church.

Operation Black Thunder

Operation Black Thunder is the name given to two operations that took place in India in the late 1980s to flush out remaining Sikh activists from the Golden Temple using 'Black Cat' commandos of the National Security Guards Like Operation Blue Star, these attacks were on Khalistani militants who were using the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Punjab as a base.
Operation Black Thunder I.
The first Operation Black Thunder took place on 30 April 1986. About 300 National Security Guards commandos stormed the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine of the Sikhs, along with 700 Border Security Force troops and captured about 300 Sikh militants. The operation, which lasted eight hours, was approved by then Chief minister of Punjab Surjit Singh Barnala of Shiromani Akali Dal.
Operation Black Thunder II.
Operation Black Thunder II (sometimes just referred to as Operation Black Thunder) began on 9 May 1988 in Amritsar and ended with the surrender of the militants on 18 May. The operation was commanded by Kanwar Pal Singh Gill who was the DGP of Punjab Police. Snipers were used in this operation. Compared to Operation Blue Star, little damage was inflicted on the Golden Temple. In what was reported as a successful operation, around 200 millitants surrendered, 41 were killed.
Gill stated that he did not want to repeat the mistakes made by the Indian army during Operation Blue Star. This operation was described as a severe setback to the Khalistan movement. In contrast to prior operations, minimum force was used under full public scrutiny. It is remembered for the free access the news media was provided unlike during Operation Blue Star. The day after the militants surrendered, nine reporters were allowed into the Temple complex. "Kirtan" was resumed at the Golden Temple on 23 May 1988 after a two week break during this operation.
While Operation Blue Star was widely considered poorly executed and shambolic due to the egregious loss of civilian lives and the damage done to both the Golden Temple and Sikh relations with the government (culminating in the assassination of Indira Gandhi by her bodyguards and anti-Sikh riots), Operation Black Thunder was far more successful with the blockade tactics paying dividends, and has been credited with breaking the back of the Sikh separatist movement. Soon after this operation, the Indian Government banned the use of religious shrines for political and military purposes and increased penalties for the possession and use of illegal weapons, as part of its strategy to fight extremism in the Punjab region.
In 2002 Sarabjit Singh who was the Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar at the time published a book "Operation Black Thunder: An Eyewitness Account of Terrorism in Punjab". The account was criticised by Kanwar Pal Singh Gill who claimed that the operation was initially called "Operation Gill" before being renamed "Operation Black Thunder".

Research Council for Complementary Medicine

The Research Council for Complementary Medicine (RCCM) is a charitable organisation (UK Registered Charity Number 1146724) founded in 1983 to develop and promote good quality research into alternative and complementary medicine (CAM) and enhance evidence based medicine in this area.
The RCCM works with the complementary therapy professions and CAM researchers to promote safe and effective integrative and personalised medicine, and to promote the development of high quality research and evidence in the UK into complementary and alternative medicine.
As the burden of complex chronic disease increases more people are turning to alternative and complementary medicine (CAM) and need guidance in making their healthcare choices. CAM is used by at least a quarter of the population of the UK. The research evidence base is limited at present. The ever increasing cost of chronic disease will require government and society to make decisions on the cost-effectiveness of the available health care options. Such decisions are best informed by evidence and currently accepted standards of care.
A greater evidence base for CAM should facilitate wider availability of access to safe and effective complementary therapies within the National Health Service and across the UK, in order to help in preventing disease and improvinghealth.
The House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee in 2000 published a report on CAM which emphasised the need for improved regulation and increased research into CAM therapies. While regulation of the main CAM professions has made considerable progress, a paucity of funding has limited the development of CAM research.
History.
The RCCM was co-founded in 1983 by a medical doctor Dr Richard Tonkins MD FRCP and a lay businessman, Mr Harold Wicks. During the 1980s, the focus of RCCM activity was on encouraging and publishing research projects, and on the exploration of appropriate research methodologies. A scientific journal was established, Complementary Medical Research (ISSN 0268-4055). A University Fellowship to explore CAM was established in partnership with the Medical Research Council and the University of Glasgow. A series of annual conferences on research methodology were organised.
During the 1990s, the RCCM focus was on undergraduate medical education and the inclusion of a CAM module as a part of the curricula for medical education; Dr Catherine Zollman became Director of the RCCM’s Medical Education Service and established a register of GPs with an interest in CAM. An RCCM research project was undertaken on the use of CAM by women with breast cancer, commissioned by South Thames Regional Health Authority
After 2000, the RCCM was commissioned to undertake and completed some very large projects in partnership with universities, including the CAMEOL project for the Department of Health to assess CAM interventions in NHS priority areas by detailed review and critical appraisal of published research
Current activity.
The current activities of RCCM are directed towards supporting the CAM professions in research and evidence-based practice, through increasing engagement between the professional bodies, the regulators, and the research community.
The CAM professions in the UK are evolving and maturating. Regulation is well developed, with statutory regulation of osteopathy and chiropractic in place, and herbal medicine, acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine moving towards statutory regulation. Other therapies such as massage and naturopathy have established voluntary regulation under the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC) and others are moving towards this goal.
Doctoral and post-doctoral research within CAM has guidance on methodology from the MRC. Research capacity in terms of on-going PhD/ MPhil research activity in complementary medicine within UK universities is increasing. However, evidence on the safety and effectiveness of CAM remains much needed, and more remains to be done in terms of translation of research into clinical practice
Funding from the government for research to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CAM, similar to that in the USA where a research funding council NCCAM provides substantial research funding specifically for CAM research, would enable the evidence base for CAM to develop in the UK.

In 1997, Emílio signed with 1. FC Köln of the German Bundesliga. He played for the youth team and finally worked his way up to the senior team where he played for several matches. In 1999, Emílio transferred to Alemannia Aachen, a team in the second Division of the Bundesliga.
Honduras and Mexico.
In 2001, Luciano Emílio made a return to Brazil to play for União Barbarense. After a brief stint at União Barbarense, Emílio made a move to the Honduran league to play for Real España in Honduras. He quickly established himself as a key player and won the league scoring titles in 2003 and 2004. He helped lead Real España to the Apertura Championship in 2003. In 2004, Emílio made a move to another Honduran team, Olimpia. Emílio won another scoring title in the Apertura in 2004 with Olimpia.
Emílio enjoyed a brief stint in Mexico in 2005, signing the Mexican second division side Querétaro where he helped the team win the 2005 Clausura title, scoring 10 goals in the process. After playing for a short time with Querataro, Emílio made a return to CD Olimpia in 2005 in time to lead them to championships in the 2005 Apertura and the 2006 Clausura, during which he once again won the scoring title. In 2006, Emílio's eight goals in the UNCAF Tournament were enough to propel his team to the 2007 CONCACAF Champions' cup. Ironically enough, Emílio would go on to play against CD Olimpia in the 2007 CONCACAF Champions' Cup with his new club, D.C. United.
Major League Soccer.
He signed with D.C. United on January 16, 2007, as a Senior International player, after completing his second stint with Honduran club Olimpia. Emílio debuted for United in the 2007 CONCACAF Champions' Cup against Olimpia, scoring once in Tegucigalpa and twice in the return leg in Washington, DC in United's 7–3 aggregate win. He went on to score a fourth time in three games versus C.D. Guadalajara in the opening game of the CONCACAF semi-final. 
At the end of his first season with D.C. United, his team received the 2007 MLS Supporters' Shield, the award for gaining the most points overall in a season. In the 2007 MLS season, Emílio had 20 goals and won the MLS Golden Boot award. Emílio won the 2007 MLS MVP award on November 14, 2007 and the inaugural MLS Newcomer of the Year Award on November 17, 2007. 
After recovering from a lean start to the 2008 season, Emílio scored his first career MLS hat-trick on June 14 against New York Red Bulls.
Though not originally signed under the Designated Player Rule, he later received a pay rise which took him over the maximum salary covered by the league, becoming a designated player.
Emílio received a green card in August 2009 for permanent residency in the United States and counted no longer against DC United's foreign player limit.
Emílio rejected a new contract with D.C. United that would have seen him sign at a significantly lower salary. He later joined former club Rio Branco, but on April 28, 2010, Emilio signed a three-month contract to return to former club D.C. United. He was released by D.C. United at the end of this short-term contract.
Uruguay.
In August 2010 he joined Uruguayan club Danubio, which plays in Primera División Uruguaya
Second Division Mexico.
Luciano Emílio returned to Mexico to play for Atlante UTN in "La División de Ascenso" Mexico's Second Division for the Clausura 2011 Tournament.

Kiss of the Fur Queen

Kiss of the Fur Queen is a novel by Tomson Highway. It was first published by Doubleday Canada in September 1998.
The novel's main characters are Champion and Ooneemeetoo Okimasis, two young Cree brothers from Eemanipiteepitat in northern Manitoba who are taken from their family and sent to a residential school. Their language is forbidden, their names are changed to Jeremiah and Gabriel, and the boys are sexually abused by priests. However, a wily trickster figure, the Fur Queen, watches over the boys as they fulfill their destiny to become artists.
The novel, a fictionalized account of the real-life childhood of Highway and his brother René, was a nominee for the Canadian Booksellers Association Libris Award and the Books in Canada First Novel Award in 1998.
Francophone Ontarian poet and academic Robert Dickson translated the novel into French. Released under the title "Champion et Ooneemeetoo", the French edition was published by Prise de parole in 2004.
Plot summary.
"Kiss of the Fur Queen" begins with the champion dog-sled racer Abraham Okimasis and the story of his two sons, Champion and Ooneemeetoo Okimasis from Eemanipiteepitat, Manitoba. Both brothers are taken from their families and sent to a residential school where they are unable to speak their language, forced to cut their hair, and renamed to Jeremiah and Gabriel. In their residential school experience, both brothers are physically and sexually abused at the hands of the priests which leads Jeremiah to an asexual lifestyle and Gabriel due to his inability to form successful relationships. The residential school is also the time that Gabriel meets the Fur Queen or better known as the trickster who watches over them throughout their lives. 
 When he returns from residential school, Jeremiah moves to Winnipeg to pursue his interests in music which acts as a coping strategy for his earlier abuse. He immerses himself fully in his musical pursuits which results in his further isolation and feelings of loneliness due to his lack of meaningful relationships and family connections. Gabriel decides to join his brother in Winnipeg to continue his passion for dance. Both brothers have troubles reconciling their two identities and this leads them to reject their Native identity and embrace the dominant culture.
Themes.
There are many themes at play in this novel. There is the theme of the trickster, an element found throughout native storytelling and fiction. In this case the trickster appears in the lives of both Abraham, who is the father of the boys, and Gabriel and Jeremiah. The trickster appears in times of great importance for the characters and is a playful figure, in contrast to the stern vengeful god that the boys are introduced to in school. Another theme found in this novel is the devastating effects of colonization on Indigenous people. Gabriel and Jeremiah are sent to residential school where they are forced to speak English, and their own Cree culture and language is demonized. Both boys are traumatized by their experiences at residential school and face issues regarding identity growing up. Reconciliation is also a strong theme found in this work. Both Gabriel and Jeremiah have to find their own way to heal from their traumatic experiences at residential school.

<doc id="9801240" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9801240" title="Indiana University School of Dentistry">
Indiana University School of Dentistry

The Indiana University School of Dentistry (IUSD) is the dental school of Indiana University. It is located on the Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis campus in downtown Indianapolis. It is the only dental school in Indiana.
History.
Under the leadership of Dean John N. Williams since June 2010, the school is located at the center of Indiana, and in the heart of Indianapolis. It is part of Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), one of eight campuses in the IU system and the premier urban campus of Indiana University. IUPUI is a fast-growing campus situated just a few blocks from Monument Circle in downtown Indianapolis.
IUPUI shares its location on the near west side of the city with the Indiana University Medical Center. Many of the dental school’s faculty members have established strong collaborative ties with physicians and other scientists in the medical center facilities, which are just across the street from the school.
During the 2010-11 academic year, 693 students pursued seven types of degree and/or certificate programs in dental assisting, dental hygiene, dentistry, and graduate dentistry. In addition, three other IU campuses (in Gary, South Bend, and Fort Wayne) offer certificates and degrees in allied dental programs.
Alumni.
The IU dental school has more than 11,000 living alumni. They are pursuing careers throughout the United States and in more than 30 other countries. The IU Alumni Association counts dentistry among its most supportive groups. IU grads have been named to prestigious leadership posts in organized dentistry and in dental education throughout the world. For example, alumna Carol I. Turner (DDS’75) was appointed chief of the U.S. Navy Dental Corps in 2003, becoming the first woman to hold the Navy’s top position in dentistry; Ronald Zentz (DDS’85) is senior director of the American Dental Association’s Council on Scientific Affairs; and Stephen Ralls (M’81 Periodontics) is executive director of the American College of Dentists.
Cheating episode.
In May 2007, the Indiana University School of Dentistry disciplined 46 dental students for cheating, according to the "Indianapolis Star". The "Star" initially reported that nine students were dismissed, 16 were suspended for periods ranging from three to twenty-four months and 21 students received letters of reprimand. However, all of the dismissals were reversed and most of the suspensions decreased after the student appeals were finalized.
The incident “involved the unauthorized acquisition, sharing and use of passwords to enter electronically locked image files meant only for examinations,” according to a memo written by Dean Lawrence Goldblatt, which the Indianapolis Star obtained. Dr. Goldblatt's memorandum states that the scandal involved the school's second-year class, the dental class of 2009. The alleged violation involved the unauthorized acquisition, sharing, and use of passwords to enter electronically locked image files that were intended only for examinations. The memorandum states that the investigation took approximately two months to complete. According to Dr. Goldblatt, all "tudents receiving any of the sanctions. . . have the right to appeal the decision to the School of Dentistry Faculty Council Executive Committee. . . within five working days of their official notice of the sanction."
Twenty-three students challenged the disciplinary determinations made by the Faculty Council at its May 4, 2007 meeting.
During the appeal process, the school reversed each and every dismissal. Hence, no students will be dismissed as a result of this scandal. The following are the final sanctions imposed against the class: 24 students suspended ranging from three months to twenty-four months. An additional 18 students received letters of reprimand.

Punch Out (Ugly Betty)

"Punch Out" (also known as "Why Do You Want to Treat Me So Bad?") is the 19th episode from the dramedy series "Ugly Betty", which aired on April 19, 2007. The episode was written by Oliver Goldstick and produced by Miguel Arteta.
Plot.
As the day begins, Betty frantically tries to keep Daniel focused on work, but as she makes phone calls to his home to ask when he was coming in, it appears that Daniel is more occupied with sleeping with women then with his job, as he has reverted to his old hard-partying ways. Betty also notices author Quincy Combs (Leslie Jordan) in Daniel's office, looking to dig up dirt about the Meade family, even after telling Betty about Fey Sommers' diaries. Betty tells Quincy that he is wasting his time but Quincy isn't buying Betty's threats. 
Betty is also distracted by Christina, who shows off an invitation to a new night club that was given to her by Wilhelmina. Christina became worried that Betty is too focused on Daniel, so she hopes that Betty will loosen up with the invitation. But as we're about to find out, old habits are hard to break. 
As Betty and Christina enter the club, Betty tries to loosen up but it's not working, even after a big guy (who claims to be from Cheboygan, Michigan) asks her to dance with him. However, Betty discovers Daniel at the same club she and Christina are at. She sees her boss and Becks partying and flirting with a young model, Petra, and her sister, Lena. After Betty sees this, she also thinks she sees Quincy, who called her for info on Daniel's whereabouts, only to discover that Quincy was never there after she tries to warn Daniel, even as to taking a microphone from the DJ booth. Daniel, upset over being embarrassed by Betty, blames her for controlling his life and causes Daniel to betray Betty in a big way as he chews her assistant out, saying that the only the time Betty should be concerned with Daniel is at work. When Christina and Betty leave the club, as Betty questions Christina why she doesn't like taking compliments for her clothes shown at the "MODE" Fashion Show, Betty learns from Christina about her "deal" with Wilhelmina and how she got the invitation, which results in Betty ending her friendship with the only person she ever trusted at "MODE".
Meanwhile, things go from bad to worse when Quincy stalks the Meades. As the other Meades deal with this new-found obstacle, Alexis schemes to get her hands on the diaries. Not to be outdone, Wilhelmina also hunts for them, as Quincy claims that the last six months of her life that were detailed in another set have not been accounted for. When Quincy confront Alexis about a secret dungeon that Bradford and Fey went for their secret trysts, Alexis decides to seek it out by looking at a blueprint of the Meade Building after Quincy shows her the passage from the diary. Alexis learns that the diaries hold a key to Bradford's treatment of Alexis, but as Alexis tries to call her dad in an effort to extend an olive branch, Wilhelmina succeeds in winning over Bradford by seducing him with her feet and learning his secret fetish, thus outwitting her former ally; it appears that Wilhelmina gave Quincy pictures of Alexis (before and after) in exchange for information on how to turn Bradford on. When Wilhelmina sees Alexis' name on Bradford's answering machine, she put it on voice mail. 
As for Amanda, she's upset that Alexis would choose Nick over her, so she attempts to sway Alexis into hiring her. Alexis also asked Amanda about the dungeon that Bradford had kept hidden, but told her it doesn't exist. But as Amanda secretly visits "The Closet" to look for shoes, she accidentally opens a compartment that leads to the hideaway.
Meanwhile, Ignacio feels the heat when Constance pressures him to make their relationship a romantic one despite his non-attraction to her, knowing that her demands stands in the way of him obtaining a green card so he can stay in the United States. So despite warnings by Hilda not to go, Ignacio believes it's the only way he can see the lawyer that Constance hired for him. When he arrives to Constance's apartment, he discovers that Constance tricked him; she never called the lawyer and used this evening to lure him into marrying him. 
Hours later, Hilda is visited by Ignacio's real caseworker, who happens to be a man! Hilda learns from him that Constance was fired two months earlier, prompting Hilda to go to Constance's place after she warns Ignacio. As she arrives and prepares to confront her, Ignacio tells Hilda that Constance isn't a bad person; she had her heart broken, so he decides not to turn her in and forgives her.
Back at Daniel's apartment, Daniel is having sex with Petra. But Lena comes in to drop a bombshell as Daniel finds himself in major jeopardy as he discovers that Petra is actually 16 and her "sister" Lena is actually her mother, who extorts Daniel into putting her daughter on the cover of "MODE". Daniel finds himself wondering what he should do to get himself out of this situation, but when he calls Betty at home, Betty, upset over Daniel's actions at the club towards her, tells Ignacio to give him a message: she just "punched out".
Production.
The episode's original title was Footloose and Meade-Free. 
It is also the last episode that reurring regular Octavia Spencer appears as Constance Grady. Both Spencer and Leslie Jordan submitted this episode for consideration of their work in the categories of "Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series" and "Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series" respectively for the 2007 Emmy Awards.

Mitsubishi B2M

The Mitsubishi B2M was a Japanese carrier-based torpedo bomber of the 1920s and 30s. It was built by Mitsubishi to a design by Blackburn Aircraft of Britain and was operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy.
Design and development.
In 1927, the Japanese company Mitsubishi commissioned the British aircraft manufacturer Blackburn Aircraft to design an aircraft, which would be built under licence by Mitsubishi if successful, to enter a competition held by the Imperial Japanese Navy for a carrier-based reconnaissance and torpedo bomber to replace its B1M. Blackburn developed a design, the Blackburn T.7B, which was an enlarged development of their Ripon, which was under development for Britain's Fleet Air Arm. The T.7B was a three-seat biplane of steel tube construction and with high aspect ratio wings fitted with Handley Page slats, powered by a 466 kW (625 hp) Hispano-Suiza 12Lbr engine. 
The design was declared the winner of the competition, with a prototype (referred to as the 3MR4) being ordered from Blackburn. This first flew on 28 December 1929 at Blackburn's factory at Brough, Yorkshire, and was shipped to Japan in February 1930.
Three development prototypes were built by Mitsubishi in Japan before the aircraft was adopted as the Navy Type 89-1 Model 1 Carrier Attack Plane or Mitsubishi B2M1.
Operational history.
The B2M1 entered service with the Imperial Japanese Navy in March 1932, serving aboard the carriers , and . Modifications to improve maintainability resulted in the B2M2 or Navy Type 89-2 Carrier Attack Plane, which otherwise showed little improvement in performance over the B2M1. Production of both versions totalled 204 aircraft.
B2Ms were extensively used for high- and low-level bombing attacks against China in the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937.

Saleh al-Oufi

Saleh al-Oufi or Saleh Muhammad 'Awadullah al-'Alawi al-'Oufi () (died 2005), was a member of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), and became the leader of that group when Abdel Aziz al-Muqrin was killed in June 2004. Al-Oufi in turn was killed in August 2005, in Madinah. 
Life.
al-Oufi was born in al-Hindiya, Saudi Arabia. He was a sergeant in the Prison detachment of the National Service, but was discharged in 1989 for his overt support of anti-government forces.
In 1993, he traveled to Afghanistan; and fought in Chechnya the following year, but sustained a head wound and returned to Saudi Arabia for medical treatment. Following his recovery, he opened a car dealership and traveled frequently to Germany through Dubai.
In 2001, he was back in Afghanistan but fled the American invasion along with Khalid al-Juhani. In 2002, he returned to Saudi Arabia for his father's funeral, which he attended disguised as a woman.
Leadership.
During his 14 months as leader of AQAP, Al-Oufi wrote a few pieces for the al-Qaida online magazines Sawt al-Jihad and "Mu'askar al-Battar", particularly about Iraq. A car bombing in Qatar, which killed one and wounded dozens, came two days after an instigation by al-Oufi (on a terrorist web forum) to attack "crusader" targets in the Gulf nations.
Al-Oufi has been variously described as a former policeman and a former prison guard. According to AQAP, he participated in some way in the fighting in Afghanistan.
Death.
One other suspect with al-Oufi was killed, and another wounded and captured. In a simultaneous raid in Riyadh, four AQAP members were killed and one captured. These raids were made possible by the interception of mobile telephone transmissions.

Years of Grace

Years of Grace is a 1930 novel by Margaret Ayer Barnes. It won the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1931. Despite this, it is not her most well-known work; that honor belongs to "Dishonored Lady", a play she co-wrote with Edward Sheldon, which was adapted twice into film (first as "Letty Lynton" and later with its actual title).
Barnes' alma mater, Bryn Mawr College, along with the characters of college presidents M. Carey Thomas and Marion Park figure prominently in this work. The story, beginning in the 1890s and continuing into the 1930s', chronicles the life of Jane Ward Carver from her teens to age fifty-four. This novel follows many of the same themes as Barnes' other works. Centering on the social manners of upper middle class society, her female protagonists are often traditionalists, struggling to uphold conventional morality in the face of changing social climates.
