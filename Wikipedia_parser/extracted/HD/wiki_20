Gao Zhongxun

Gao Zhongxun (; ; born 4 January 1965) is a former Chinese international football Midfielder of Korean descent who spent the majority of his career with Jilin FC as well as representing China in the 1992 Asian Cup. 
Biography.
Gao Zhongxun started his football career with his local football club Jilin FC and was considered a promising enough youngster to be called-up to the Chinese U-20 squad that took part in the 1985 FIFA World Youth Championship where he played in all four games as China were knocked-out in the quarter-finals. His time within the Chinese youth set-up would continue when in 1988 the Chinese youth team were allowed to play within the Chinese league system and throughout the 1988 campaign he played for them as the team called themselves China B. Upon his return to Jilin FC he found them relegated not to the second division but to the third tier after the Chinese Football Association restructured the league system, however by the 1990 campaign he would be part of the squad that won the division title and promotion to the second tier. 
Gao's performances for Jilin would be considered impressive enough that despite playing for a second division side he would still be called-up to the Chinese national team for the 1992 AFC Asian Cup and helped guide China to a third place finish. This was followed by Jilin eventually gaining promotion back into the top tier in time for the first fully professional 1994 Chinese Jia-A League season.

Since then, Arakel has devoted his life to weightlifting.
Career.
Mirzoyan won various junior championships. The Armenian weightlifter won silver at the 2007 European Youth Championships in Landskrona with a total of 257 kg. A year later, in the city of Durrës, he became champion of Europe with a total of 310 kg.

He competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics. In a dispointing proformance, Mirzoyan failed complete a total and dropped out of the competition. Weeks later, Armenian Weightlifting Federation President Samvel Khachatryan revealed Mirzoyan had been suffering from psychological problems, preventing him from competing to the fullest of his ability. In training, Khachatryan saw Mirzoyan lift 160 kilograms in snatch and 200 kilograms in clean and jerk. Khachatryan stated that he would not have allowed Mirzoyan to perform if he had been aware of his psychological problems. Mirzoyan himself later apologized to his fans for his defeat and promised to learn from his problems and give a better proformance at the 2016 Rio Olympics.

Miguel Buiza Fernández-Palacios

Miguel Buiza Fernández-Palacios (1898 – 1963) was a Spanish Navy officer best known for being the Commander of the Spanish Republican Navy during the Spanish Civil War. He died in exile in Marseille in 1963.
Miguel Buiza is often referred to as an Admiral, owing to his high profile role in leading the Spanish Republican Armada, but there are sources that claim that he never rose above the rank of Captain "(Capitán de Navío)", a rank below Admiral.
Early life.
Miguel Buiza was born in a wealthy family of factory owners in Seville. In 1915 Buiza entered the Naval Academy at San Fernando. By 1932 he had reached the rank of Lieutenant Commander () of the Spanish Republican Navy. Four years later, when the Spanish Civil War started, he was in command of military tugboat "Cíclope" (RA-1) and refused to join the July 1936 pro-Fascist coup, remaining loyal to the republic. His brother Francisco, a commander of the Spanish Republican Army, joined the rebel faction after the coup and was killed in action in the front near Madrid early in the Civil War.
In early August 1936, at the beginning of the war, Miguel Buiza took part in the blockade of the Strait of Gibraltar as commander of light cruiser "Libertad". Later in the same month he saw action in the Battle of Majorca in support of the failed republican landing operation at Porto Cristo.
On 2 September Miguel Buiza was named Captain General of the republican fleet by Indalecio Prieto, the Navy and Air Minister ("Ministro de Marina y Aire"), while keeping the command of the "Libertad". In the dire 1936 post-coup reorganization of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces Prieto did away with the Navy 'ship committees' and sought to create a structure that would reimpose discipline after the bulk of the top commanders had defected to the rebels. Buiza was only 38 years old at the time of becoming commander of the Republican Armada.
Following the disappoining defeat of the Spanish Republican fleet on 27 September 1938 at the Battle of Cape Cherchell, when a series of tactical errors on the part of the republican command resulted in the loss of two cargo ships, Miguel Buiza was relieved of his duties as commander of the Navy and replaced by Captain Luis González de Ubieta who was promoted to the post of Admiral. President Manuel Azaña acknowledged in his memories the indecisiveness of the commander of the Spanish Republican Navy despite having a greater number of ships. After being demoted, Buiza was transferred from one post to another, such as Inspector of naval bases, Chief of staff of the Navy and then also secondary posts such as naval personnel director, until he was reinstated to Captain General of the Republican Armada in February 1939.
Shortly thereafter, on 5 March 1939, Spanish Republican Army Colonel Segismundo Casado made an anticommunist coup and proclaimed a "Consejo Nacional de Defensa" in order to seek an armistice with the rebels and end the fratricidal war, a measure that Miguel Buiza favored. On the same day the Nationalist Air Force bombed the harbour of Cartagena, the main base of the Republican Navy, sinking the destroyer "Sanchez Barcaiztegui". Following the bombing and the unrest in the city, where a rebellion was under way between adversaries and supporters of the continuation of the civil war, Miguel Buiza decided to the evacuate the seaworthy units of the Republican fleet. As soon as night fell at least three cruisers, eight destroyers and two submarines left Cartagena harbor speeding towards high seas.
The fleet took an eastward course led by Miguel Buiza on cruiser "Miguel de Cervantes" and reached Algerian waters. Off Oran city Buiza asked for permission to anchor, but the naval authorities of French Algeria did not allow the commander to lead the Spanish Republican ships into their harbor. These directed him towards Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia where the fleet arrived on 7 March. Not long after anchoring the fleet was impounded by the French authorities. Except for a few crewmen who were put on guard duty on the ships, the Spanish Republican seamen and their officers were interned in a concentration camp at Meheri Zabbens, near Meknassy in an abandoned phosphate mine. Miguel Buiza refused any special treatment and asked to be interned together with the other sailors.
Exile.
In May 1939, after the Spanish Republic had already lost the Civil War, Miguel Buiza asked the French government for permission to join the French Foreign Legion ("Légion étrangère") where he was admitted as foreign officer with the rank of captain. At the beginning of World War II Buiza had been promoted to commander, but in mid 1940 he resigned following the Second Armistice at Compiègne between Nazi Germany and the Third French Republic. Certain sources claim though that he was forced out of the French Foreign Legion by the new authorities of Vichy France because of his antifascist past.
Miguel Buiza settled in Oran, where he worked as an accountant in a hotel. In 1947 he was recruited by Zeev Hadari, one of the representatives in France of the "Hamossad Le'aliyah Bet", the Haganah branch in the British Mandate of Palestine that facilitated Jewish immigration to Palestine in violation of governmental British restrictions. Under the name "Moshé Blum" Buiza became Commander of merchant vessel "Geula", former USS Paducah (PG-18). On 2 October 1947 the ship was intercepted while trying to run the British blockade and bring Jewish refugees to Palestine. Buiza was arrested by the British authorities and interned in a concentration camp near Haifa. After regaining his freedom Miguel Buiza returned to Oran. In 1962, following the Évian Accords and the independence of Algeria, he joined the exodus of the Pieds-Noirs and went to France as a refugee.
Miguel Buiza died in exile in Marseille on 23 June 1963, barely a year after his arrival from Algeria, without having been able to return to Seville, the city of his birth where his family members still lived. He is buried at the graveyard in Hyères, in the Var department. 
Less than two months after Miguel Buiza's death his widow published a short obituary in the Spanish ABC newspaper.

Agha Waqar's water-fuelled car

Agha Waqar Ahmed's water-kit is a technical design of an alleged "perpetual motion machine" created by Agha Waqar Ahmed, an inventor based in Khairpur, Sindh, Pakistan. In July 2012, Agha Wager Ahmed's Water-kit was publicly announced as an apparatus that allows water to be used as a source of fuel in cars. The apparatus consists of a "water-kit" that can break water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules through the process of water electrolysis. Ahmed claims that any car using his kit can run exclusively on water and will yield 40 km of distance on a liter of water. He has also claimed that his technology can power the entire country with water. His claims have been met with scepticism as well as enthusiasm from Pakistani scientists. Critics have pointed out that in order for the invention to work, it would have to violate the second law of thermodynamics.
Water kit.
Ahmed calls his invention "water-kit". The kit consists of a cylindrical jar (which holds the water), electrodes, wires to be attached with car's battery and a hose leading to the engine. The kit claims to use electrolysis to convert water into HHO gas, which is then used as fuel in an otherwise unmodified gasoline engine. The kit states that it requires distilled water. Ahmed claims that he has been able to achieve much higher amounts of HHO compared to any other inventor because of his "undisclosed calculations". He has applied for a patent from the Government of Pakistan and is waiting for their feedback.
Government response.
Ahmed claims to have done several demonstrations for Pakistani government officials. According to a television interview he has had three meetings with Government's Science and Technology sector as well as a meeting with Pakistan's Atomic energy commission.
Upon hearing about his invention, the prime minister of Pakistan, Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, formed a committee consisting of three people. The committee members were Khursheed Shah, the minister of religious affairs, Mir Changez Khan Jamali, the federal minister for Science and Technology, and Dr. Asim Hussain, the advisor to the Prime Minister on Petroleum and Natural Resources. Out of the three members, Khursheed Shah has publicly supported Ahmed's invention.
After much publicity and media coverage, many government officials came forward to offer support for Ahmed's invention. Along with the aforementioned federal minister for Religious Affairs, two other federal ministers endorsed his work. Sindh Minister for Law and Prisons, Mohammad Ayaz Soomro, called Ahmed a national hero while speaking to a media group. Three other government officials congratulated him, stating that he "brought a revolution in the world of Science". However it should be noted that Ahmed has been criticised for not clearly explaining how his invention could work without violating the laws of thermodynamics. Ahmed was invited by Jamil Ahmed Khan, the Pakistani ambassador to UAE, to demonstrate his technology in Abu Dhabi. Abdul Qadeer Khan, a nuclear scientist, has supported the idea of a water-fuelled car; however he has been criticised for his position.
Samar Mubarakmand was supportive of this idea and seemed enthusiastic at first, but when Agha Waqar was called by Pakistan Television Corporation to take the demo of this Water Kit, he failed to give a demonstration in the live program in his car, claiming he had not fit the Water kit in his car for the TV program. Mubarakmand then told him that in his opinion, calcium carbide is added in water to produce the fuel for the engine. In that case, the calcium carbide is the energy source, not the water.
Criticism.
Atta ur Rahman, a scientist and a former minister of Science and Technology, called for a technical investigation of Ahmed's car by top engineering universities when he appeared on Geo TV's "Capital Talk". He told the host, Hamid Mir, that such inventions don't work and if they were to work, they would violate the law of conservation of energy. Ahmed replied to this criticism by stating that he had already made long drives with the car, done demonstrations for politicians and media personalities. He even challenged Rahman to check and verify his water fueled car himself. By the end of the show, everyone agreed that the car should be tested by independent sources. Rahman showed similar concerns in another show by Talat Hussain Syed, "News Night with Talat", for Dawn News.
While speaking to Express Tribune, Rahman stated he suspected this invention to be a scam. He repeated that such an invention would have to violate the laws of thermodynamics to work.
On 11 August 2012, Rahman reported that the vehicle was to be fully inspected by engineers at the National University of Science & Technology, but Ahmed never showed up for the appointment. This caused Rehman to further accuse Ahmed of fraud, stating "Agha Waqar Ahmad did a disappearing act and never turned up for the appointment. The fraud had been exposed and escape was the only route available to him".
Pervez Hoodbhoy, a nuclear physicist, wrote in The Express Tribune that Ahmed's coverage in the media, along with endorsement by government authorities and scientists, has exposed the ignorance and self-delusion of such entities. He criticized politicians and media for hailing Ahmed as a national hero and for promoting pseudo-scientific theories related to water-fueled cars. He insisted any technology should comply with basic principles of Science before getting any government funding.
It is worth mentioning that before Agha Waqar Ahmed, another Pakistani known as Doctor Ghulam Sarwar had claimed in December 2011 that he had invented a car that only runs on water.
Several other skeptics have also weighed in on Ahmed's invention, mainly due to its violation of second law of thermodynamics. On 6 August 2012, a physics teacher, Ranomal Malani, challenged Ahmed to demonstrate his kit publicly. If he succeeds, Malani have promised a pay out of five million rupees. Ahmed has accepted the challenge.
Talat Hussain, who covered Ahmed's invention on his show, did a follow up show on 3 August 2012 to address the skeptics. His guests consisted of a panel of scientists, a PHD student and a reporter for KTN News. Ahmed was notable by his absence. The Scientists reiterated the problem of water-kit's incompatibility with the second law of thermodynamics. One of the guests, Javed Ahmed Chatta, said he was present at one of the demonstrations and showed his skepticism; however, his concerns were ignored by the authorities. Another guest, Adeel Ghayur, stated that even if the apparent violation of natural laws was ignored the cost to operate such a car would be impractical.

Seč, Novo Mesto

Seč ( or "Gehack (bei Tschermoschnitz)", Gottscheerish: "Gəhack") is a remote abandoned settlement in the Municipality of Novo Mesto in southern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia statistical region. Its territory is now part of the village of Travni Dol.
Name.
The Slovene name "Seč" and the German name "Gehag, Gehack" are semantically identical, referring to cleared land. The Slovene common noun "seč" means 'logged land, lumbering' as does the German common noun and choronym "Gehack".
History.
Seč was a village inhabited by Gottschee Germans. It was founded relatively late because it was not listed in the Gottschee land registry of 1574 or in the 1770 census. In 1931 it had seven houses and a population of 33. Before the Second World War the economy of the village was based on farming and selling wood, and the villagers also owned some vineyards. The residents were evicted in 1941 and the village was burned by Italian troops in 1942.

Roland Stobbart

Roland (Rol) Stobbart, (1909 - 1981) was an international speedway rider and promoter who started his career with the Leeds Lions team in 1931.
Biography.
Early days.
Roland Stobbart was born at Aspatria, Cumberland, England in 1909; the eldest of two sons to an haulage contractor. Even before he reached maturity one Cumberland newspaper was describing him as, “probably the finest racing motorcyclist in Cumberland. A clever, daring rider who does not know the meaning of the word fear.” He was at that time attached to the Workington Motor Cycling Club. By the age of twenty he had met with considerable success on Dirt tracks and Grasstracks throughout the north of England and had successfully taken part in sand races in Scotland. When they introduced grass track racing at Whitehaven he became the principal prize-winner. In 1930 he entered the senior Manx Grand Prix on the Isle of Man, formerly known as the Manx Amateur Motorcycle Road Race. Although he buckled his front wheel half-a-mile from the start he continued the race and the distance of over 200 miles with a soft tyre and a badly bent wheel. His average speed was 64.7 miles per hour, and he did the fastest lap at 68 miles per hour. Stobbart entered the race in the following two years but despite doing good times in the practice laps he failed to complete either of the races. In 1932 he retired after the first lap when he suffered a puncture.
Workington.
The first motor cycle cinder track race at Workington took place at Lonsdale Park on 15 August 1931. The event promoted by the Workington Motor Cycle Club was the brainchild of Roland Stobbart. A total of 32 competitors from all over the North of England, including future world finalist Bill Kitchen, took part in a series of 'scratch' and 'handicap' events in a 21-race programme and attracted over 2,000 spectators. Both Roland and his younger brother Maurice both competed, and although Sheffield rider, George Mortimer, won both events Roland set the course record and beat him in the Cumberland versus Yorkshire match. The winner of the 'scratch' event received the princely sum of £5, while second and third received £3 and £1-10 shillings (£1.50p) respectively. Meanwhile, the winner of the 'handicap' event picked up £4, with the second and third placed riders collecting £2 and £1-10 shillings (£1.50p) each. Notwithstanding the size of the crowd this inaugural meeting was a financial disaster and in consequence no more meetings took place that year. However the banked, narrow circuit, at 439 yards per lap had provided fast and exciting racing despite its narrow width restricting races to only three riders. In 1932 the 'Border Sports Club' promoted a total of eight meetings, held at fortnightly intervals, and attracted crowds averaging 3,000 for each meeting. On 28 June, Roland, who often raced with a cigarette between his lips, broadsided, skidded and wobbled four times round the rain soaked track at 45 miles per hour to set a new one mile record for the Workington track of 1 min 19.2 seconds, two seconds short of the then British record. At these events Stobbart won both the Golden Sash. and the Golden Helmet.
National Speedway.
Roland began his English national Speedway career riding for Leeds Lions during the 1931 season, while simultaneously riding at Workington. In 1932, after a short spell with Preston he moved to West Ham, London, after the Lancashire club folded. He remained with the ‘Hammers’ until he moved to Provincial league Bristol in 1937. In 1938 he rode for the Newcastle Diamonds, where he remained until World War II disrupted his career. In the 1939 season he was a sensation. He bought a motorcycle from Arthur Atkinson for £15 and then proceeded to score 16 out of 18 points at Newcastle, 8 out of 9 points at Edinburgh, 9 out of 12 at Sheffield, and 10 out of 12 at Hackney, London. During the 1948 season he came out of retirement to act as Newcastle second reserve.
International honours.
On 1 November 1935, Roland left Aspatria to sail for Australia as a member of the England team chosen to ride in the test matches that winter. He was accompanied by Arthur Atkinson, Harold Tiger Stevenson, Joe Abbott, Dusty Haigh and Jack Parker. He was selected again in season 1939 when he rode for England against the Dominions.
Promoter and manager.
In 1937, Roland broke his arm while riding for West Ham and as a consequence took no further part in that year's campaign. Instead he became manager of Workington, a position he retained in 1938; introducing riders of the calibre of George Greenwood, George Pepper, Charlie Spinks and Norman Hargreaves. He also promoted Speedway at Dam Park, Ayr in 1937, and Carlisle in the same year.
In 1933 Rol became a minor celebrity, appearing as a stuntman in a film entitled "Money for Speed", starring Ida Lupino and John Lauder.

<doc id="36594260" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36594260" title="Srobotnik, Dolenjske Toplice">
Srobotnik, Dolenjske Toplice

Srobotnik (; , sometimes "Guttenberg", Gottscheerish: "Liəlochpargəl") is a remote abandoned settlement in the Municipality of Dolenjske Toplice in southern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. Its territory is now part of the village of Občice.
Name.
The name "Srobotnik" is based on the common Slovene noun "srobot" 'clematis' with the addition of the associative suffix '-nik'. The Gottschee German name "Liəlochpargəl" is semantically similar, derived from the dialect word "Lieloch" 'clematis' (from Middle High German "liele") + "pargəl" 'little mountain'. The names thus refer to the local vegetation. The standard German name "Gutenberg" (literally, 'good mountain') may simply be an optimistic name expressing wishes for a good harvest.
History.
Srobotnik was a Gottschee German village. The settlement was not mentioned in the land registry of 1574 or the census of 1770, and so it was probably a more recent settlement. In 1931 it had 10 houses and a population of 31. The inhabitants were evicted in the fall of 1941. During the Rog Offensive in the summer of 1942, Italian forces burned the village and it was never rebuilt.

<doc id="36594283" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36594283" title="Anna Homler">
Anna Homler

Anna Homler (Born November 1, 1948, in Los Angeles, California) is a visual, performance, and vocal artist living and working in Los Angeles. She has performed music and exhibited her artworks in venues around the world. She earned a B.A. at the University of California, Berkeley, 1970, in Anthropology, and an M.A. in Education and Languages at Boston University, 1973. She graduated from Alexander Hamilton High School, Los Angeles.
Career.
In 1989, Homler was part of the Direct Sound project which took Homler to Europe with the musical performance group organized by avant-garde vocalist David Moss and including vocalists Shelley Hirsch, Carles Santos and Greetje Bijma; they performed at the Taktlos Festival in Switzerland as well as several other venues in Europe. Homler participated in many music festivals in Europe including Milanopoesia in Milan, Italy, the Festival International des Musiques Actuelle, Nancy, France, and the LMC Annual Festival of Experimental Music, South Bank, London. 
John Payne wrote in the "L.A. Weekly" "Anna Homler, L.A.-based but not often heard locally (she's a popular-in-Europe type), sings, in an invented language that 'nobody knows but everyone understands,' and plays a nice little assortment of wind-up clocks, toys and other mechanical doodads; her output is filtered through electronic devices..."
In "Option" Dean Suzuki wrote: "Homler is a Los Angeles-based performance artist in whose work art plays a central role. In all of her work, Homler creates a persona who expresses herself in a newley invented language that appears to be rife with tradition, ritual, ceremony and a culture all its own. The language is couched in lyrical and somewhat exotic melodies sung with a pure vocal style sans vibrato, which gives the work an ambience of authentic folk tradition" .
In 1982, while driving through Topanga Canyon in her '61 Caddy, Anna Homler experienced and auto-epiphany: "I began spontaneously singing and chanting in a language I'd never heard before--word and rhythm were one." This experience...prompted her to create an ancient, storytelling character named "Breadwoman" who...earned Homler acclaim as a "linguistic alchemist." Kateri Butler continues in an article in the "L.A. Weekly", "Like the French deconstructionist movement, Anna transcends the mere word: 'I deal with the poetic, which releases us from the narrowness of our perceptions'."
Homler's assemblage work has been included in a number of museum exhibitions, including "40 Years of California Assemblage," organized by the UCLA Frederick Wight Art Gallery at UCLA, which traveled to the San Jose Museum of Art, San Jose, Calif., Fresno Art Museum, Fresno, Calif. and the Joslyn Art Museum, Omaha, Nebraska. Her work was also included in the exhibition "Outside the Frame, Performance and the Object: A Survey History of Performance Art in the USA since 1950," at the Cleveland Center for Contemporary Art, 1994, Cleveland, Ohio.
"Pharmacia Poetica".
"She created "Pharmacia Poetica" '87, an ongoing installation and performance project exploring the tonal and symbolic properties of words and objects..."
In "Wire", Ed Baxter writes that Homler's "style suits today's cut-and-paste aesthetic, but is perhaps rooted more firmly in the confrontational caberet and framed detritus of Kurt Schwitters, the pranks of Fluxus, the assemblages of Joseph Cornell, even the outré inventories of Charles Fort." . ""Pharmacia Poetica"...an installation project started in 1987 and which contains an apothecary's room which displays the stuff of dreams rather than pills. The project's motto is 'For every malady, there's a melody." Its subject is the examination of the symbolic and tonal quality of words and objects."
Since 1987, "Pharmacia Poetica," Homler's...library of glass bottles rather than books, the "Pharmacia" is a reliquary of the easily overlooked and unnoticed. Mysterious organic substances along with obsolete materials and artifacts reside in deeply hued ambient fluids. Plant-like fibers and filaments are as illusory as memories floating on the edge of consciousness. Other vessels include recognizable objects--magnetic cassette tape, typewriter erasing ribbon, wooden blocks with letters, fragments of untranslatablr language in liquid elixirs. The bottles come in various shapes and sizes; several contain tiny bottles inside larger ones like little sunken vessels.
"...Anna Homler has set up shop, a pseudo-apothecary that caters to the spirit more than the body. The L. A. -based performance and visual artist launched her 'Pharmacia Poetica' project 10 years ago in the form of a radio play and storefront exhibition. It has since traveled widely, evolving, expanding and contracting according to the circumstances of each venue."
In 2011 Homler had an exhibition of "Pharmacia Poetica" installed at the Den Contemporary Art gallery at the Pacific Design Center, Los Angeles. Lisa Derrick writes about the show in the "Huffington Post", "Born in to a family of pharmacists, artist Anna Homler took a different route to her life to provide succor using ethereal, transcendent art forms to heal the psyche..."
Performance Art.
"Breadwoman".
"Breadwoman" was a performance art character developed by Homler in 1982. Her costume included a face covered with a loaf of bread. In a series of performances, the artist wears a mask of dough and peasant clothes as she sings shamanistic incantations in an inventive language that is at once playful and mysterious.
"The Whale".
...a Homler family relic: the immense--indeed as she puts it, womblike--turquoise 1960 Cadillac Homler inherited from her aunt and uncle, and in which she floated through life until coming into a more practical vehicle. But Homler could not simply give up or destroy The Whale, as she called it; like any good artist, she made an installation out of it. The transformation is appropriately aquatic, right down to the ambient sound and typically Homlerian barrier reef of personal artifacts.
"The Whale's" first art incarnation was in an installation/performance at Espace DBD, December 11, 1981, in which we were taken in groups of four or five from an 'underwater' grotto waiting room replete with live mermaids and lots of fish food, on a magical mystery tour in the newly transformed Whale car, chauffeured by Homler through Cheviot Hills."
Voice.
In 2012, Anna Homler and Sylvia Hallett released the album "The Many Moods of Bread and Shed," (Orchestra Pit Records).
"Anna Homler is an experimental vocalist. "House of Hands", Homler whispers and seduces with her voice, and the electronics state an eerie case on this unusually crafted recording. It is disconcertingly bewitching."
In a significant 1989 performance event sponsored by German painter and musician A. R Penck in Heimbach, Germany, Homler participated in "Ost und West," with a number of European musicians and artists. In 1997, she was included in "Vox", an (Nicht nur Nicht) album featuring ten tracks by ten German composers, and performers from the experimental scene. 
"With ears wide open, Homler haunts toy shops, hardware stores, and thrift shops, ever on the prowl for all manner of noise-makers, sonic gizmos, and other potential instruments." Dean Suzuki continues his review in "Musicworks", "Homler's texts are based mostly on an invented language of her own. Using a vocal delivery that is part little girl, part old woman, and an intangible something else which involves a non-Western tribal community, her songs suggest something primal, communal, earthy; yet they are also imbued with mystery, ritual, even magic." 
Homler has collaborated in the USA and Europe with a number of notable composers and musicians including, in Europe, the Voices of Kwahn, Steve Beresford, Pavel Fajt, Peter Kowald, Frank Schulte, Richard Sanderson, Geert Waegeman, and Sylvia Hallett; and in the USA with Steve Moshier, David Moss (musician), Ethan James, Steve Roden, and Steve Peters. She appears with free jazz musicians included in "Off the Road" (2007), a documentary film made by Laurence Petit-Jouvet about a United States tour in 2000 with German musician Peter Kowald.
Recent Works.
In 2012, Anna Homler and Sylvia Hallett released the album "The Many Moods of Bread and Shed" (The Orchestra Pit). Also among her recent projects, Homler's installation artwork was the subject of a 2010 documentary, "M'Bo Ye' Ye," (composed with Geert Waegeman) by Los Angeles filmmaker Jane Cantillon about the "Pharmacia Poetica." "The Heart of No Place" (2009), an independent film by Rika Ohara based on the life of Yoko Ono, includes music by Anna Homler and Bernard Sauser-Hall. She is included in Kate Crash's current interactive documentary created with EZTV’s Michael Masucci. The film, "LA Woman," (2011) premiered as part of the Pacific Standard Time initiative sponsored by the Getty Research Institute. It screened at the Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena, California.

John Ellis (pastoralist)

John Ellis (ca.1803 – 22 March 1873) generally known as "Captain Ellis", was a pastoralist and businessman prominent in the early days of South Australia. 
He was a son of an Oxford clergyman of the Church of England.
Career.
He arrived in South Australia from England on the "Buckinghamshire" on 22 March 1839, listed as "Captain Ellis", though on what basis it is not known, and in company of a George Ellis.
In July 1839 he and his longtime friend Captain William Allen purchased two thirds of "Milner Estate" near Port Gawler from George Milner Stephen, the misrepresentation of which transaction was to haunt Stephen in later years. In 1855 he purchased Allen's share. This area includes the land later known as Buckland Park, which he sold to Dr. J. H. Browne and Col. P. J. Browne in 1856. He took up the nearby Hummocks run in 1842,and Barabba, north-east of Mallala, South Australia, in August 1844.
He bought land in New Zealand.
Starting in 1851, he purchased over 50,000 freehold acres in the Hundreds of Benara and Blanche, between Mount Gambier and Port MacDonnell and 34 square miles of leasehold land, where he ran some 73,000 sheep, He purchased the remainder of Benara (originally spelled Benaira) and an adjacent station, Coola comprising 22,000 acres of freehold and 36,000 acres of leasehold, from the South Australian Company in 1875.
Managers.
The general manager of most of his properties, and largely responsible for his good fortune, was Hugh Cameron (ca.May 1796 – 10 June 1884). Born in the Braes of Rannoch, Scotland, he is reported as arriving in South Australia early in 1838, but perhaps arrived on the "Thomas Harrison" 25 February 1839, or the "Lady Bute" 18 June 1839. The Hundred of Cameron was named for him.
Another significant employee was J. C. Kennedy (ca.1827 – 10 October 1897), from the same part of Scotland, who managed the Benara and Coola properties for him, then for his son T. C. Ellis.
Politics.
In June 1851 he accepted the petition of a number of electors for the seat of Flinders in the reconstituted Legislative Council, and in August 1851 became one of the first sixteen elected parliamentarians in South Australia.
Retirement and death.
He made a considerable fortune and retired with his second wife to England. His son Thomas took over his estates, and his children in turn continued to run Benara and Coola into the 20th Century.
Family.
A brother arrived in Adelaide on the "Lord Glenelg" on 10 May 1841.
He was married twice: his first wife, believed by one family researcher to have been Elizabeth Jane White Cathery, by whom he had eight children including:
His second wife was Susan Hindmarsh ( – 24 August 1882), daughter of Sir John Hindmarsh.

Weiße Flotte (Stralsund)

The Weiße Flotte ("White Fleet") is a shipping company with its head office in Stralsund, Germany, that offers passenger and car ferry services as well as excursions by boat, especially along the Baltic Sea coast of the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
History.
In 1945, after the Second World War, shipping by private shipowners initially picked up again on a moderate scale under the direction of the "Arbeitsgemeinschaft Binnenschiffahrt Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts" with its head office in Berlin. On 27 October 1949 the state-owned firm of "Deutsche Schiffahrts- und Umschlagsbetriebs-Zentrale" (DSU) was established with its main branch in Stralsund. All the freight and passenger transport on the inland waterways of East Germany was transferred to this company.
Founded on 1 January 1957, the VEB passenger shipping company in Stralsund, "Weiße Flotte", with its head office in Stralsund took over the overwhelming majority of excursion and scheduled services along the entire Baltic Sea coast. This company initially had just eleven staff and another 17 employees as well as 10 motor vessels, with a total seating of 1,511, in its first year of operations.
Over the years, branches were set up along the Baltic coast, the ships were modernized and the number of staff increased. Amongst the services operated at that time were excursions were to Gedser, Fehmarn and Møn, round trips around Rügen and Hiddensee, ocean crossings and harbour cruises. After extensive renovations to the ships of the "White Fleet" in 1958/59 and the addition of a ferry service to Altefähr, e.g. with the "Stralsunder", the number of ships at the beginning of 1959 increased to 17 vessels with a total of 2,488 seats. Three years later, the fleet of passenger ships rose to 23 through the acquisition of the "Genossenschaftsreederei Hiddensee" of Vitte. Now a total of 3,251 seats were available. In 1961 two hydrofoils, the TF 10-1 and TF 10-2 joined the "Weiße Flotte" from Roßlau, and were assigned to services between Warnemünde and Rostock-Kabutzenhof. By the end of 1963, the "Weiße Flotte" employed 36 passenger ships with 4,740 seats and two freighters were employed on a total of 44 scheduled services.
In 1974, the "Weiße Flotte" was further modernized with the purchase of three hydrofoils of the Kometa-M type. The boats, which had been built in the Soviet Union at the shipyard of Poti (Grusinische SSR), were selected for fast services on the Stralsund - Sassnitz - Szczecin or Rostock - Wismar lines. With a speed of 32 knots (60 km/h), these boats needed only about four hours, for example, for the route from Stralsund via Sassnitz to Swinoujscie and were thus much faster than the cruise liners.
With a fleet of three hydrofoils, 31 passenger ships, seven ferries, two freighters and a ferry unit ("Fährschubeinheit") for heavy goods vehicles, the "Weiße Flotte" transported 4.7 million passengers on 85 routes in 1989.
In 1990 the "Weiße Flotte" was privatized and taken over by the shipping association of "Förde Reederei Seetouristik" from Flensburg. The traditional name of "Weiße Flotte" remained unchanged. All the old ships were sold and replaced with new, more modern and more comfortable ships.
The president of the district council of Rügen, Gesine Skrepski, opened a new jetty for the Wittow Ferry in 1994.
In 1995, the "Reederei Hiddensee", a subsidiary of the "Weiße Flotte", was founded. The "Reederei Hiddensee" operates all the regular services from Zingst, Wiek, Stralsund and Schaprode to the island of Hiddensee. Through the establishment of "Reederei Hiddensee" the area of operations of the "Weiße Flotte" expanded to include ferry services (Glewitz - Stahlbrode, Warnemünde - Hohe Düne, Wittow Nord - Wittow-Süd) and excursions on the Baltic Sea.
Ships/routes.
The "Weiße Flotte" runs several car and passenger ferries along the Baltic Sea coast of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.

IPCRI – Israel/Palestine Center for Research and Information

IPCRI – Israel/Palestine Center for Research and Information (; Arabic: ) is a joint Israeli/Palestinian NGO and public policy think tank based in Jerusalem working towards a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Under shared Israeli-Palestinian leadership, IPCRI carries out research and projects for peace-building and environmental sustainability. IPCRI also facilitates public outreach and track two negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.
Mission.
The Israel/ Palestine Center for Research and Information is a joint institution of Israelis and Palestinians dedicated to a just, viable and sustainable resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on the basis of “two states for two peoples."
History.
In 1988, as a response to the first few months of the First Intifada, Gershon Baskin published an advertisement in three Palestinian newspapers inviting Palestinians who believed in a two-state solution to contact him. He met with 23 interested Palestinians and laid the foundation for IPCRI as a public policy think tank in search of a two-state solution based on self-determination and security for both Palestinians and Israelis.
Integral in the structure of the new organization was joint management by two directors—one Israeli, one Palestinian—as well as an equally divided board of directors. The fledgling organization worked for over a year to garner support and partnership from prominent Israeli and Palestinian politicians to ensure its survival and effectiveness. A Palestinian co-director, Zakaria al Qaq was appointed in accordance with the declared policy of IPCRI of sharing management of the organization between Israelis and Palestinians.
After this phase, IPCRI began its work by establishing working groups on business and economics, water, and the issue of Jerusalem. Participants included officials from both communities, economists, scientists, NGO representatives and journalists. Reports arising from these meetings played an important role in informing key Israeli and Palestinian deliberations and negotiations over the years.
In response to the favorable atmosphere created by the Oslo I Accord, IPCRI expanded its activities and became involved in peace education, putting forward proposals for the creation of legal frameworks dealing with investment and other economic issues, and environmental concerns. IPCRI sought both to provide a safe environment in which Israelis and Palestinians could share their concerns and influence public policy.
The coming of the Second Intifada in 2000 made the work of IPCRI more
difficult but activity continued in almost all of the areas of concern mentioned above. IPCRI developed wide ranging contacts within Israeli and Palestinian society and continued to attract funding from the international community.
IPCRI founder Gershon Baskin served as the Israeli Co-CEO of IPCRI from its establishment in 1988 through the end of 2011. The Palestinian Co-CEOs of IPCRI were Zakaria al Qaq, Khaled Duzdar, and Hanna Siniora. Currently, IPCRI is co-managed by Israeli Dan Goldenblatt and Palestinian Riman Barakat from their offices in Jerusalem.
Areas of Work.
Environment.
The Environment and Water Department at IPCRI was established in 1994. It has as its objective the promotion of effective cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians regarding the environmental future of the region. Over the years it has been concerned, among other issues, with conflicts over water and the promotion of low cost sanitation projects, the introduction of solar energy into the region, the vexed question of the treatment of hazardous waste, the study of air pollution and the long term impact of climate change. Earlier initiatives included the training of Israelis and Palestinians in the specialized field of environmental mediation. The program has been financed largely by the international community. Donors have included United States Agency for International Development, the European Union, the Canadian aid agency International Development Research Centre, as well as a variety of national governments. Over the years several thousand Israelis and Palestinians have taken part in the program together with many diverse international experts.
GLOWA.
IPCRI has been an active partner in the “GLOWA Jordan River Project”. This is an international study of the future of the water scarce Jordan River Basin financed by the German Ministry of Education and Research. Research teams from Israel, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, and Germany took part. The project began a decade ago and IPCRI joined it in 2006. Its role was to promote genuine cooperation among the partners and to help prepare alternative scenarios as to what response to the impact of climate change should be in different political and economic circumstances
Water Conferences.
In 2004 IPCRI organized a major conference on water issues in the Middle East which was attended by over 200 Palestinian, ISraeli, Jordanian, Turkish and various international experts and officials and held in Antalya, Turkey. The published results of the conference have become a standard text for those working on water issues in the region and the inter-personal relationships developed both at this conference and at other IPCRI seminars on water distribution and quality, have done much to promote effective dialogue between the two communities. The papers presented were published by Springer Verlag, in Germany in 2006. IPCRI undertook work on providing low cost sanitation to Palestinian villages in the West Bank with the support of the Japanese Government in 2009.
Political Think Tank and Track II Negotiations.
Strategic Thinking and Analysis Team (STAT).
Every month a team of Palestinian and Israeli academic, political, and economic leaders come together for a think tank session about a specific aspect of the advancement of a just and sustainable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Subsequently, IPCRI publishes policy papers with the meetings' findings. Recently, experts have engaged in conversation on such topics as normalization, the status quo in the peace process, and collective rights in Israel and Palestine. From these discussions, the experts produce policy papers with their reflections an recommendations addressing the issues. These meetings are supported by the German foundation Konrad Adenauer Stiftung.
Release of Gilad Shalit.
On 25 June 2006 Gilad Shalit an Israeli IDF Soldier was abducted by Hamas. Gershon Baskin had met a professor of the Islamic University of Gaza at a conference in Cairo. Through him he was able to establish contact with a Hamas operative, and then with Ghazi Hamad, Hamas´s deputy Foreign minister. Baskin offered the Olmert government help to negotiate a deal for the release of Gilad Shalit but was rejected. After David Meidan became the new representative in the negotiations to release Gilad Shalit under the Netanyahu government in April 2011, Baskin renewed his offer. Meidan rejected his offer for five years before agreeing. Baskin was able to establish a communication line through which he was able to negotiate with Ahmed Jabari, operational leader of Hamas´s military wing, and high on the list of terrorists wanted by Israel.
Peace Building.
Peace Education Program.
From 1994 to 2005, IPCRI established a Peace Education curriculum to be taught to 10th graders in Israeli, Palestinian, and Jordanian schools. The original Peace Education curriculum was implemented in 32 schools, involving 3,000 students and 200 teachers—eventually the program grew to be implemented in 70 schools around the country.
The project was developed jointly by Israelis and Palestinians and drew on subjects already taught in classrooms, such as sociology, history, and literature. IPCRI project coordinators collaborated with the Israeli Ministry of Education in an attempt to expand the program. IPCRI endeavored to implement this program in order to equip high school students, mature enough to deal with the difficult subject matter, with conflict resolution skills and the values of peace, respect, and human rights. The project also included a sophisticated training program for the Peace Education instructors, which qualified the teachers to coach students in conflict resolution and also allowed for teachers from each side of the conflict to meet and interact.
In 2005, IPCRI was forced to discontinue the program due to budgetary restrictions, despite its success in bringing students and teachers from Israel and Palestine together, even during the Intifada.
Israeli and Palestinian Women for Change.
This project, which spanned from May to December 2011, aimed to engage and empower Israeli and Palestinian women. It is supported by the Middle East Partnership Initiative. Mixed groups from across Israel and the West Bank came together first in small discussion groups to create a foundation of familiarity. The beginning of the project aimed to increase the women's self-confidence and organizational skills. The participants were also encouraged to find common ground by discussing such transcendent women's issues as childcare and pregnancy.
In its second stage, Women for Change Now brought participants together for a weekend-long conference. Participants in this conference addressed Israeli-Palestinian conflict issues more directly by requiring groups of women to create their own peace-building projects and to collaborate to implement these initiatives.
The projects created include a Hebrew-Arabic language workshop, a handicraft cooperative, a youth engagement initiative, and a cultural festival, among others.
Visit Israel/Palestine.
IPCRI runs tours for Israelis and Palestinians in various cities across Israel and Palestine. IPCRI facilitates an exchange of information by obtaining travel permits for participants where travel is largely restricted. These trips have toured such destinations as Bethlehem and Jericho with the goal of breaking down physical and mental barriers, removing suspicion and fear of the other, and building up trust and support for a political peace process.
Partners for Change.
IPCRI is bringing together 300 Jewish and Arab youths from Lod, Ramle and Tel Aviv-Jaffa (mixed Arab/Jewish cities). These young people work together to improve their cities after a process of reflection on their separate identities and the unique situation within their cities. They learn to understand the experiences and circumstances of the other side and subsequently collaborate to develop a hands-on community development project.
The project aims to foster a sense of "shared citizenship, justice and equality". Through the development of a participatory community improvement program, the youth work together across the Israeli and Arab communities. Partners for Change is supported by the United States Agency for International Development.
Research of Israeli and Palestinian Textbooks.
In 2004, the United States Consulate in Jerusalem commissioned IPCRI to investigate textbooks in Israeli and Palestinian schools to examine whether they are of a tolerant, peaceful nature or a belligerent and discriminatory towards the other side.
According to IPCRI's published reports, Palestinian textbooks have improved greatly in recent years but still some notable gaps and problems still exist. IPCRI reports an overriding nationalist theme in Palestinian textbooks, fostering pride and commitment to the Palestinian cause and cultural identity. As a corollary, some of the material "could be viewed by others (e.g., the Israelis) as promoting incitement and contempt". The textbooks often leave out historical events with great importance to Israel, such as the Oslo Accords, and references in any context to the State of Israel are minimal. The textbooks do feature peace educational materials, but not as they are applied to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The name 'Israel' does not appear on any maps in the textbooks, according to the report, and the textbooks are disapproving of Israeli policies like demolitions and occupations, and of Zionism as a whole.
IPCRI reported that in the Israeli textbooks, information is presented in a Zionist framework, but acknowledge prospects for peace with others who inhabit the land. IPCRI researchers publicized that references to Arabs are minimal; those that do exist are sometimes stereotypical and negative. Some Israeli textbooks also teach that Arabs left their land willingly or sold it to the Jews on the eve of Israeli independence.
The IPCRI reports were instrumental in refuting the claim that Palestinian textbooks "incite hatred or violence towards Israel and the Jews...or Western values". According to "The Economist", the Israeli Minister of Education, three years after the reports of the release, urging Israeli schoolbooks to include more accurate maps and "enforcing" obligatory Arabic language education for elementary school students.
This study has also been covered in the Wikipedia page Textbooks in the Palestinian territories.

SKIDATA

SKIDATA AG SKIDATA AG is an Austrian company and is ranked among the worldwide leading providers of access solutions and visitor management. Almost 10.000 SKIDATA systems guarantee quick and secure access for people and vehicles in: ski regions, shopping centers, major airports, cities, sport stadiums, fair and amusement parks.
History.
In 1977, Günter Walcher developed the first electronically printed tickets and cash registers, and thus replaced the handwritten ski passes previously used. To market and further develop these innovations, SKIDATA was founded in Grödig bei Salzburg. In 1979, the first cash register was implemented that used an electromagnetic stamp unit to print tickets. The System 320 was released in 1981; it consists of a register computer and an automated output device.
1979: First cash register. An electromagnetic stamp unit to print tickets.
1981: The System 320 was brought to market. It consists of a register computer, an automated output device and an access reader. The new access system supported seamless billing and connected larger ski regions. By 1986, SKIDATA's market share for access management in ski resorts had grown to more than 80 percent.
At the end of the 1980s, SKIDATA released the first access systems with hands-free technology. SKIDATA developed the first hands-free ski ticket – the Keycard. SKIDATA utilizes "hands-free" technology, also known as RFID technology. During this time, SKIDATA expanded its portfolio from ski destinations to include parking management. This was followed shortly thereafter by sports arenas, amusement parks and trade fairs.
In 1990, SKIDATA was the first provider of parking management solutions that allow drivers to enter the facilities and pay by credit card directly at the parking gantry. That same year, the company equipped its first international airport, Munich Airport, with a parking management system. In 1991, SKIDATA had its first successes with trade fairs at Düsseldorf's convention center. In 1995, the company partnered with the Swiss company Swatch to develop watches that also provide access authorization.
In 1997, French chip card maker Gemplus becomes majority shareholder of SKIDATA.
From 2000 onward, continued internationalization. Takeover by the Swiss Kudelski Group in 2001 opens new markets.
In 2007, SKIDATA started its operation in India with a local partner Hinditron and formed a partnership business.

German submarine U-251

German submarine "U-251" was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" during World War II. The submarine was laid down on 18 October 1940 at the "Bremer-Vulkan-Vegesacker Werft" (yard) in Bremen as 'werk' 16, launched on 26 July 1941 and commissioned on 20 September under the command of "Kapitänleutnant" Heinrich Timm.
In ten patrols, she sank two ships of 11,408 GRT. She was a member of three wolf packs.
She was sunk by British and Norwegian aircraft in the Kattegat in April 1945.
Service history.
After training with the 6th U-boat Flotilla, she became operational on 1 May 1942. "U-245" was transferred to the 11th flotilla on 1 July and the 13th flotilla on 1 June 1943. There followed spells with the 24th, 21st and 31st flotillas, (see infobox for dates).
1st patrol.
The boat's first patrol was preceded by a short trip between Kiel and Kristiansand in Norway. Her first sortie proper began with her departure from Kristiansand on 20 April 1942. The second part of this patrol was marked by sinking the "Jutland" south of Bear Island on 3 May after the ship had been hit by bombs from German aircraft. She then made three forays from Kirkenes, Skjomenfjord and Trondheim over the rest of May.
2nd patrol.
Her second patrol was also in May and covered the eastern Norwegian Sea.
3rd patrol.
The submarine sank the "El Capitan" on 17 July 1942 near northeast Iceland. This ship was with Convoy PQ-17 before being attacked by Luftwaffe Ju-88s. The ship had been abandoned; "U-251" finished her off.
For the rest of her career, the U-boat patrolled northern waters; at one time steaming as far north and east as Novaya Zemlya in the Kara Sea.
10th patrol and loss.
By the time of her tenth sortie, the Allies dominated the air. This situation was dramatically demonstrated when the boat was sunk by rockets from no less than eight British and Norwegian Mosquitos of 143, 235 and 248 squadrons in the Kattegat on 19 April 1945.
Thirty-nine men died; there were four survivors.

Varietease

Varietease is a 1954 American burlesque documentary film and the first such directed by Irving Klaw. According to its plot, the iconic pin-up model Bettie Page performs a burlesque show alongside Lili St. Cyr, Chris La Chris, Vicki Lynn, Bobby Shields, and others.
Synopsis.
"Varietease" was Klaw's first documentary film reflective of burlesque clubs of the 1950s. Master of ceremonies Bobby Shields introduces the film's acts. Bettie Page performs a nudity-free Dance of the Seven Veils but teases in only removing four veils. Lili St. Cyr does four separate sequences, wherein she dresses and undresses to her undewear. Bettie Page returns presenting act cards while performing a few burlesque moves as she presents. Following are a comic, a female impersonator, the Barrow and Rodgers dance team, additional songs, and can-can dancers. The film ends with a pastie-covered reveal of Lili St. Cyr's chest.
Reception.
Bettie Page performed a "particularly sexy but amateurish" Dance of the Seven Veils in the film. One performance by transvestite performer Vicki Lynn in the film was said to have "crystallized the transgressive potential of the burlesque film." Varietease is one of the "famous compilations" of "classic burlesque shows."
The film was rereleased by Something Weird Video in 2006, sharing release with "Teaserama". DVD Verdict noted that the films were both performed and staged as if for live audiences but offered: "Still, there is something endlessly fascinating about this old-fashioned flesh fest." In looking at the films 50 years after they were made, it was noted that the comedians were bad, the dance acts "droned on," and only a couple of the songs were mildly amusing. The reviewer stated that while the film would be best appreciated by viewers already fans of St. Cyr and Page, "he stripping is indeed skillful and the ladies are almost always lovely to look at" and continued, "Sure, in 2006 these acts look positively tame. However, back when pornography was a social sin and fornication was for procreation, a glimpse of gam or a peek at some pert personal pillows was the height of honorable horniness."
Lawsuit.
The film was the subject of a lawsuit by Page's estate against Something Weird Video, an Oregon company that was marketing videos of the film. Page's estate argued that marketing materials for the video infringed on Page's rights as a celebrity. A U.S. district court ruled against Page's estate because the video company had legitimately obtained all rights to the film and its associated marketing materials.

Not Another Happy Ending

Not Another Happy Ending is a 2013 British romantic comedy film directed by John McKay and stars Karen Gillan, Stanley Weber, and Freya Mavor. Produced by Claire Mundell and Wendy Griffin, and written by David Solomons, the film premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival on 30 June 2013.
It was largely shot in Glasgow's Merchant City.
Plot.
Tom Duvall, the editor of a struggling publishing company, discovers that his only successful author, Jane Lockhart, cannot write when happy. Due to her recent success, she is left unable to write and he is stuck. He is forced to make her incredibly unhappy. The thing is, the worse he makes her feel, the more he realizes he's in love with her.
Production.
The film was financed in part by a crowdfunding campaign on the website Indiegogo, which raised USD$22,660. Additional funding came through the efforts of producer Claire Mundell, who "[patch-worked] a bunch of different sources of funding together, none of whom interfered in any kind of way with the way the film turned out".
Scottish actor Emun Elliott was originally attached to play the role of Tom, but was replaced with French actor Stanley Weber. This led the filmmakers to write into the script the character's French background, as well as "a lot of explanation about how this French guy could end up in Glasgow and be a publisher".

Danish Fashion Institute

Danish Fashion Institute (DAFI) is a network organization established by the Danish fashion industry in 2005. With more than 100 member companies, DAFI's purpose is to facilitate initiatives that benefit the Danish fashion industry, but which companies cannot implement acting alone.
Copenhagen Fashion Week.
DAFI's first big initiative was the establishment and development of Copenhagen Fashion Week, which had previously only existed as a trade fair event. Today, Copenhagen Fashion Week is an established international event with a show schedule of more than 40 shows, five fashion fairs, 2,400 brands exhibited and hundreds of activities for both professionals and the general public.
Nordic Fashion Association and NICE.
In 2008, DAFI created a pan-Nordic fashion network with Nordic Fashion Association in collaboration with its sister-organizations in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland. Nordic Fashion Association runs the sustainability project NICE (Nordic Initiative, Clean and Ethical) which supports and motivates fashion companies to integrate environmentally sustainable and socially responsible practices into their design and business models. 
In December 2009, DAFI and Nordic Fashion Association contributed to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP15) by gathering 650 fashion industry professionals, experts and NGOs from across the globe in a conference that brought up visions and challenges for a sustainable fashion industry. Another NICE conference was held in May 2012 with more than 1,000 participants.
Other initiatives.
Besides the above projects, DAFI works to strengthen the industry's competitiveness through knowledge-sharing workshops, seminars and conferences on topics like CSR, internationalization, business competencies, market trends and innovation.
As such, DAFI coordinated the Danish political initiative Modezonen, a collaboration with the Danish Chamber of Commerce, The Trade Council of Denmark, Danmarks Designskole, Teko, KEA, Copenhagen Business School and Danish Design Centre. The purpose of Modezonen was to create a shared platform and prepare the fashion industry for global competition while making Denmark a significant fashion player and putting Copenhagen on a par with leading fashion metropolises. In February 2010, Modezonen launched fashionforum.dk, a media for the Danish fashion industry with articles, forums and job ads.

World War II.
The lighthouse on the island was a cause of concern to Soviet forces in World War II and, at one stage, the keeper was captured and taken away for questioning by a landing party of Soviet marines.
Polar bear.
In 1953, a polar bear was shot on the island. The bear was found by the brothers Aksel Jacobsen Bogdanoff (1922–1971) and Ingvald Bogdanoff (1920–1995) when they were out inspecting their salmon nets in the area. It was believed that the bear had come on an ice-floe from Svalbard.
This is the last time that a polar bear was seen anywhere in Finnmark county.
Population.
Although the island is now uninhabited, this was not always the case. In 1567, when there were only eight families in the town of Vadsø and five families in Store Ekkerøy, there were eight families on Lille Ekkerøy.
The eleven children of Signe Bogdanoff (née Dahl, from Tromsø) and Jacob Wilhelm Bogdanoff (which included the brothers Aksel Jacobsen Bogdanoff and Ingvald Bogdanoff mentioned above) were the last generation who lived on Lille Ekkerøy. They were evacuated during World War II, moving to Krampenes, but returned and lived there until about 1953, when they moved back to Krampenes.

Fundamental Physics Prize

The Fundamental Physics Prize is awarded by the Fundamental Physics Prize Foundation, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to awarding physicists involved in fundamental research which was founded in July 2012 by a Russian physicist and internet entrepreneur Yuri Milner. , this prize is the most lucrative academic prize in the world and is more than twice as big as the amount given to the Nobel Prize awardees. This prize is also dubbed by the media as the 'XXI Century Nobel'.
Nominations and awards money.
, anyone can nominate a candidate through the FPP website.
, each award is worth $3 million. The monetary value exceeds that of the prestigious Nobel Prize, which in 2012 stood at slightly more than $1.2 million. Physics Frontiers Prize laureates (those on the shortlist Fundamental Physics Prize) who do not go on to be awarded the Fundamental Physics Prize will each receive (as of 2013) $300,000 and will automatically be re-nominated for the Fundamental Physics Prize each year for the next 5 years.
New Horizons in Physics Prize.
The New Horizons for Physics Prize, awarded to promising junior researchers, carries an award of $100,000. The winners of the 2013 prize are Niklas Beisert of ETH Zurich, Davide Gaiotto of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Ontario, and Zohar Komargodski of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. The winners of the 2014 prize are Freddy Cachazo of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, Shiraz Minwalla of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, and Slava Rychkov of the Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University, currently at CERN.
FPP Laureates.
The following is a listing of the laureates, by year.
Trophy.
The Fundamental Physics Prize trophy - a work of art created by Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson, is a silver sphere with a coiled vortex inside. The form is, in fact, a toroid, or doughnut shape, resulting from two sets of intertwining three-dimensional spirals. Found in nature, these spirals are seen in animal horns, nautilus shells, whirlpools, and even galaxies and black holes.
Ceremony.
The name of 2013 prize winner was unveiled at the culmination of a ceremony which took place on the evening of March 20, 2013 at the Geneva International Conference Centre. The ceremony was hosted by Hollywood actor and science enthusiast Morgan Freeman. The evening honored the 2013 laureates − 16 outstanding scientists including Stephen Hawking and CERN scientists who led the decades-long effort to discover the Higgs-like particle at the Large Hadron Collider. Sarah Brightman and Russian pianist Denis Matsuev performed live for the guests of the ceremony.

Mendrisio–Stabio railway

The Mendrisio–Stabio railway is a railway line in Ticino, Switzerland.
It was opened in 1926 as part of the international Valmorea railway, but only two years later the border crossing was closed by the Italian government, which didn't agree with a privately owned international connection (the Italian section of the line was operated by Ferrovie Nord Milano).
The Swiss section remained active, and is now used only as a freight railway for the industries around Stabio.
Since 1993 the line is also used by touristic trains on the re-opened line to Malnate.
A new branch, the Arcisate–Stabio railway, is currently under construction. It will connect Varese to Mendrisio, and therefore to Lugano and Como.

MV Stena Britannica

The Stena Britannica, launched towards the end of 2010, is the second of two identical Ropax ferries built by Wadan Yards in Warnemünde and nearby Wismar, Germany for Stena Line. The first of the two ships, launched in January 2010, was the Stena Hollandica. Both ships operate (2012) across the southern North Sea between Harwich and Hoek van Holland providing a twice daily service (running nine hours) from each side. The ships were specifically designed for this route.
Power and its transmission.
The Stena Britannica has four main MAN diesel engines, producing between them 33,600 kW, and providing for a maximum speed of 22 knots (25 mph). Two of the engines are rated at 9,600 kW and the other two at 7,200 kW. The engines are connected via two gearboxes to two controllable pitch propellers. The two rudders, one behind each propeller, are of the Becker flap type with twisted leading edges. Control of the bow while docking is by two tunnel thrusters.
Heat from the main engines is also used to heat the ship.
Loading characteristics.
The vehicle decks can be loaded on two levels from both the bow and stern on decks 3 and 5 and there are two tier linkspans in both Harwich and Hoek van Holland to accommodate the ship.
Extended gestation.
The ferries, then designated "RoPax 55" ferries, were originally ordered from the ship builders Waden Yards (subsequently subsumed into Nordic Yards Wismar) by Stena Line in 2006. The total value of the order amounted to approximately €400 million. Delays arose when Stena temporarily withdrew the order in response to economic difficulties being experienced by Waden Yards. After further negotiations the order was reinstated, but the new agreement included a price cut of 6% or approximately €24 million. The ships having been completed, naming ceremonies took place on 8 June 2010 for the "Stena Hollandica" at the Hook of Holland and on 19 October 2010 at Harwich for the "Stena Britannica".

<doc id="36595079" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36595079" title="Super Minkowski space">
Super Minkowski space

In mathematics and physics, super Minkowski space or Minkowski superspace is a supersymmetric extension of Minkowski space, sometimes used as the base manifold for superfields. It is acted on by the super Poincaré algebra.
Definition.
The underlying supermanifold of super Minkowski space is isomorphic to a super vector space given by the direct sum of ordinary Minkowski spacetime in "d" dimensions (often taken to be 4) and a number "N" of real spinor representations of the Lorentz algebra. (When "d" is 2 mod 4 this is slightly ambiguous because there are 2 different real spin representations, so one needs to replace "N" by a pair of integers "N"="N"1+"N"2, though some authors use a different convention and take "N" copies of both spin representations.) 
However this construction is misleading for two reasons: first, super Minkowski space is really an affine space over a group rather than a group, or in other words it has no distinguished "origin", and second, the underlying supergroup of translations is not a super vector space but a nilpotent supergroup of nilpotent length 2. This supergroup has the following Lie algebra. Suppose that "M" is Minkowski space, and "S" is a finite sum of irreducible real spinor representations. Then there is an invariant symmetric bilinear map [,] from "S"×"S" to "M" that is positive definite in the sense that the image of "s"×"s" is in the closed positive cone of "M", and is nonzero if "s" is nonzero. This bilinear map is unique up to isomorphism. The Lie superalgebra has "M" as its even part, "S" as its odd or fermionic part, and the Lie bracket is given by [,] (and the Lie bracket of anything in "M" with anything is zero). 
The dimensions of the irreducible real spinor representations for various dimensions "d" of spacetime are given by the following table:
The table repeats whenever the dimension increases by 8, except that the dimensions of the spin representations are multiplied by 16.
Notation.
In the physics literature, Minkowski spacetime is often specified by giving the dimension "d" of the even bosonic part, and the number of times "N" that each irreducible spinor representation occurs in the odd fermionic part. In mathematics, Minkowski spacetime is sometimes specified in the form "M""m"|"n" where "m" is the dimension of the even part and "n" the dimension of the odd part. The relation is as follows: the integer "d" in the physics notation is the integer "m" in the mathematics notation, while the integer "n" in the mathematics notation is a power of 2 times the integer "N" in the physics notation, where the power of 2 is the dimension of the irreducible real spinor representation (or twice this if there are two irreducible real spinor representations). For example, the "d"=4, "N"=1 Minkowski spacetime is "M"4|4 while the "N"=2 Minkowski spacetime is "M"4|8. When the dimension "d" or "m" is 2 mod 4 there are two different irreducible real spinor representations, and authors use various different conventions.
In physics the letter "P" is used for a basis of the even bosonic part of the Lie superalgebra, and the letter "Q" is often used for a basis of the complexification of the odd fermionic part, so in particular the structure constants of the Lie superalgebra may be complex rather than real. Often the basis elements "Q" come in complex conjugate pairs, so the real subspace can be recovered as the fixed points of complex conjugation.

The Forsaken (novel)

The Forsaken is the first novel of a trilogy written by Lisa M Stasse which was published on 10 July 2012 by Simon & Schuster. It is centered on and narrated by sixteen-year-old Alenna Shawcross, an orphan from UNA (United Northern Alliance) which is a merger of Canada, the United States and Mexico after a global economic meltdown. The novel, which is set in the present tense, follows Alenna as she learns to survive on Prison Island Alpha - an island where the government sends teenagers who fail the GPPT (Government Personality Profile Test).
Plot.
As an obedient orphan of the U.N.A. (the super-country that was once Mexico, the U.S., and Canada), Alenna learned at an early age to blend in and be quiet — having your parents taken by the police will do that to a girl. But Alenna can’t help but stand out when she fails a test that all sixteen-year-olds have to take: The test says she has a high capacity for brutal violence, and so she is sent to The Wheel, an island where all would-be criminals end up.
The life expectancy of prisoners on The Wheel is just two years, but with dirty, violent, and chaotic conditions, the time seems a lot longer as Alenna is forced to deal with civil wars for land ownership and machines that snatch kids out of their makeshift homes. Desperate, she and the other prisoners concoct a potentially fatal plan to flee the island. Survival may seem impossible, but Alenna is determined to achieve it anyway ...
Characters.
Alenna Shawcross - the sixteen-year-old protagonist and narrator. She is described as having brown hair and blue eyes.
Liam - a mysterious boy who is the village's best fighter and scouter. Alenna feels connected to him some how.
Gadya - Alenna's friend and a fighter for the village, Gadya had been on the "wheel" for fourteen months and used to be in a relationship with Liam.
Matthieu Veidman - the leader of the village. Veidman has been on the "wheel" for three and a half years. He is in a relationship with Meira.
Meira - often mistaken as Veidman's sister/twin, Meira is a beautiful girl and Veidman's girlfriend.
David Aberly - a boy who helps Alenna at the start of the book but is captured by the Monk.
The Monk - the leader of four out of six sectors of the "wheel", not much is known about the Monk, except for the fact that he has been on the "wheel" much longer than any of the others.
The drones are the monks warriors
The Test.
The Government Personality Profile Test (often shorterned to GPPT in the novel) is the test that all sixteen-year-olds in the UNA are forced to take. It was created by Minister Harka as a way to detect future criminals before they have a chance to cause trouble. Anyone who fails is branded an "Unanchored Soul" and sent to Prison Island Alpha where they can't harm anyone but each other and the life expectancy is a mere eighteen years. There are no questions, all that happens is a serum gets injected into the person's veins and the computer does the rest.
The Island.
All teenagers who fail the GPPT (see above) are sent to Prison Island Alpha, nicknamed the wheel by the people who live there, and the Land Across the Water or the Forgotten Place by people on the mainland. It is called the Wheel because it is split into six sectors; the Monk's territory - orange, purple, yellow and red - the villagers' territory which is the blue sector, and finally the grey zone where bad things happen. It is described as being lush and forest like.

Dattaji Rao Scindia

Dattaji Rao Scindia (Shinde) (1723 - 10 January 1760) was the second son of Ranoji Rao Scindia and Maina Bai alias Nimba Bai. Mina Bai gave birth to three sons of Ranoji, Jayappaji, Dattaji, Jyotiba. Jayappaji was the eldest among the three and Jyotiba, the youngest.
He was the elder half-brother of Mahadaji Scindia who later became the confederacy head of Gwalior, and Regent for his nephew Jankoji Rao Scindia I from 1755 until his death.
Battle with Afghans and Death.
He was a Maratha military general who was given the command of Punjab during the Afghan-Maratha Conflicts over the regions of North India in 1758-59.
Dattaji was defeated and killed at battle with Afghans at Barari Ghat (Buradi ghat), on the plain of Rudhir, near Delhi on 10 January 1760.
In the morning of 10 January 1760, the Rohillas of Najib Khan attempt a crossing at Barari-ghat . Sabaji Sindhia who was guarding the ghat resisted the enemies with his few men, after reporting the attack. Dattaji rushed from his camp on a horse to prevent this intrusion darting his spear at the enemies . But the Rohilla snipers hidden in the bushes were waiting for this opportunity, they shot down Dattaji with a bullet shot. The Bhaubakhar describes his death as when Dattaji fell off his horse with a bullet wound and was lying there on the battle field . Raghoba Pagnis said to Rajaram Chopdar, “ Do you go up to Qutubshah and say to him that Dattaji Shinde lies wounded on the field and that he should take him off the field .”Rajaram Chopdar saw Qutb Shah on his elephant and having known him for long, saluted him said in the Muslim tongue, "Saheb, our Patil has fallen, please save him." Qutb Shah asked him to take him there. Upon reaching Dattaji he asked him, “Will you fight us again”. To Which he replied bravely “Bachenge to aur bhi ladenge .” Enraged, Qutb Shah unsheathed his sword, kicked Dattaji over, and beheaded him, despite Rajaram's pleas . Dattaji’s body was cremated by Rajaram Chopdar.

Stockeld Park

Stockeld Park is a Grade I country house and estate in North Yorkshire, England.
The estate is located 2 miles north-west of Wetherby on the Harrogate road. The house is constructed of stone in the style of a Palladian villa, with all the rooms leading off from a central hall. It features a rare cantilevered staircase, 18th and 19th century furniture and works of art. Features of the grounds include a dovecote, lodges, a ha-ha, a walled garden and thatched timber loggia. 
History.
The Stockeld estate had belonged for several generations to the Middelton family of Ilkley. In 1757, the then owner, William Middelton, commissioned architect James Paine to build the present house, which was completed by 1763. William Middelton died before it was completed and the house and estate passed to his infant great-nephew, William Constable. Constable adopted the name and arms of Middelton and eventually took up residence, but his wife, the mother of his ten children, had a high-profile affair with a groom. William, after divorcing his wife, left Stockeld to live in his other property in Ilkley, leaving the house empty for some twenty years. Succeeding generations of Middeltons continued to live at Ilkley, leasing out the Stockeld until it was eventually sold in 1893 to Robert John Foster, owner of Black Dyke Mills in Bradford. Foster commissioned architect Detmar Blow to make several improvements, including converting the orangery to a chapel. He was appointed High Sheriff of Yorkshire for 1898–99.
During the Second World War, the house was requisitioned for use as a maternity hospital.
Stockeld is now a Grade I historic house and occupied by Peter Grant, a great-grandchild of Robert John Foster. The main rooms are used for receptions and conferences and parts of the estate grounds are open to the public.

Chinese musical notation

Ancient.
The earliest known examples of text referring to music in China are inscriptions on musical instruments found in the Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng (d. 433 B.C.). Sets of 41 chimestones and 65 bells bore lengthy inscriptions concerning pitches, scales, and transposition. The bells still sound the pitches that their inscriptions refer to. Although no notated musical compositions were found, the inscriptions indicate that the system was sufficiently advanced to allow for musical notation. Two systems of pitch nomenclature existed, one for relative pitch and one for absolute pitch. For relative pitch, a solmization system was used.
Older guqin.
The tablature of the guqin is unique and complex; the older form is composed of written words describing how to play a melody step-by-step using the plain language of the time, i.e. Descriptive Notation (Classical Chinese)
Prescriptive Notation.
The newer form of guqin notation is composed of bits of Chinese characters put together to indicate the method of play is called Prescriptive Notation. Rhythm is only vaguely indicated in terms of phrasing. Tablatures for the qin are collected in what is called qinpu.
Gongche notation.
Gongche notation used Chinese characters for the names of the scale.
Jianpu (Numbered musical notation).
The jianpu system of notation (probably an adaptation of a French Galin-Paris-Cheve system) had gained widespread acceptance by 1900. It uses a movable do system, with the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 standing for do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si. Dots above or below a numeral indicate the octave of the note it represents. Key signatures, barlines, and time signatures are also employed. Many symbols from Western standard notation, such as bar lines, time signatures, accidentals, tie and slur, and the expression markings are also used. The number of dashes following a numeral represents the number of crotchets (quarter notes) by which the note extends. The number of underlines is analogous to the number of flags or beams on notes or rests in standard notation.

GHGProof

GHGProof is an Open Source model designed to evaluate the impacts of land-use decisions on greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption at the community scale. It has been developed by Sustainability Solutions Group, a Canadian workers co-operative, and has been widely used in British Columbia since 2008, with regular revisions and updates from SSG's GHGProof pages. Reviews of GHGProof and comparison to other modelling platforms may be found in references.
History.
GHGProof was first conceived in a project designed to evaluate the impact of a land-use plan on Salt Spring Island in BC, commissioned by the Islands Trust. Following this project, SSG was awarded a research grant from CMHC and worked with the Fraser Valley Regional District to develop an open source model for wide distribution. GHGProof was piloted with the City of Abbotsford and the Town of Hope, and baseline GHG inventories were created for a workshop with all the FVRD municipalities in which they could develop scenarios. The Government of BC requires that all municipalities include GHG targets in their official community plans, creating an incentive for this type of modelling. An article in Municipal World describes the use of the model in the FVRD.
Architecture.
GHGProof consists of two components. The first component is a series of analysis in GIS that analyse travel behaviour, building distribution and forest and agricultural areas for a community. The second component is an excel spreadsheet that takes inputs from the GIS analysis and uses a series of calculations to generate GHG emissions, energy use and energy costs for a community. For a detailed summary on the structure of the model see the GHGProof Guidebook. Interactive skins have been placed over the model to facilitate community engagement.
Scope.
GHGProof includes GHG emissions and reductions from public and private transportation, mode shifting to walking and cycling, commercial transportation, private dwellings, commercial buildings, embodied carbon from road construction, district energy, agricultural practices, liquid and solid waste, food miles (transportation of food), forest area and forest practices. New parameters are added periodically. 
Outputs of the model include total GHG emissions, per capita GHG emissions, reductions by type, energy use by type, vehicle kilometres travelled, mode share, $ savings from energy, $ of investment, jobs created and marginal abatement cost.
Uses.
GHGProof has been used by communities to evaluate land-use planning decisions including to develop an achievable GHG target, develop a realistic strategy to achieve a target, evaluate a large-scale development proposal and evaluate a land-use plan.

History of the function concept

The mathematical concept of a function (and the name) emerged in the 17th century in connection with the development of the calculus; for example, the slope "dy/dx" of a graph at a point was regarded as a function of the "x"-coordinate of the point. Functions were not explicitly considered in antiquity, but some precursors of the concept can perhaps be seen in the work of medieval philosophers and mathematicians such as Oresme.
Mathematicians of the 18th century typically regarded a function as being defined by an analytic expression. In the 19th century, the demands of the rigorous development of analysis by Weierstrass and others, the reformulation of geometry in terms of analysis, and the invention of set theory by Cantor, eventually led to the much more general modern concept of a function as a single-valued mapping from one set to another.
Functions before the 17th century.
According to Dieudonné and Ponte, the concept of a function emerged in the 17th century as a result of the development of analytic geometry and the infinitesimal calculus. Nevertheless, Medvedev suggests that the implicit concept of a function is one with an ancient lineage. Ponte also sees more explicit approaches to the concept in the Middle Ages:
Another short but useful history may be found in Eves.
The notion of "function" in analysis.
As a mathematical term, "function" was coined by Gottfried Leibniz, in a 1673 letter, to describe a quantity related to a curve, such as a curve's slope at a specific point. The functions Leibniz considered are today called differentiable functions. For this type of function, one can talk about limits and derivatives; both are measurements of the output or the change in the output as it depends on the input or the change in the input. Such functions are the basis of calculus.
By 1718, Johann Bernoulli "had come to regard a function as any expression made up of a variable and some constants", while Alexis Claude Clairaut (in approximately 1734) and Leonhard Euler introduced the familiar notation "f(x)" for the value of a function.
Euler.
In the first volume of his fundamental text "Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum", published in 1748, Euler gave essentially the same definition of a function as his teacher Bernoulli, as an expression or formula involving variables and constants e.g., . Euler's own definition reads:
Euler also allowed multi-valued functions whose values are determined by an implicit equation.
In 1755, however, in his "Institutiones Calculi Differentialis," Euler gave a more general concept of a function:
Medvedev considers that "In essence this is the definition that became known as Dirichlet's definition." Edwards also credits Euler with a general concept of a function and says further that
Fourier.
In his "Théorie Analytique de la Chaleur," Fourier claimed that an arbitrary function could be represented by a Fourier series. Fourier had a general conception of a function, which included functions that were neither continuous nor defined by an analytical expression. Related questions on the nature and representation of functions, arising from the solution of the wave equation for a vibrating string, had already been the subject of dispute between d'Alembert and Euler, and they had a significant impact in generalizing the notion of a function. Luzin observes that:
Cauchy.
During the 19th century, mathematicians started to formalize all the different branches of mathematics. One of the first to do so was Cauchy; his somewhat imprecise results were later made completely rigorous by Weierstrass, who advocated building calculus on arithmetic rather than on geometry, which favoured Euler's definition over Leibniz's (see arithmetization of analysis). According to Smithies, Cauchy thought of functions as being defined by equations involving real or complex numbers, and tacitly assumed they were continuous:
Lobachevsky and Dirichlet.
Nikolai Lobachevsky and Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet are traditionally credited with independently giving the modern "formal" definition of a function as a relation in which every first element has a unique second element.
Lobachevsky (1834) writes that
while Dirichlet (1837) writes
Eves asserts that "the student of mathematics usually meets the Dirichlet definition of function in his introductory course in calculus.
Dirichlet's claim to this formalization has been disputed by Imre Lakatos:
However, Gardiner says
"...it seems to me that Lakatos goes too far, for example, when he asserts that 'there is ample evidence that had no idea of [the modern function concept'."
Moreover, as noted above, Dirichlet's paper does appear to include a definition along the lines of what is usually ascribed to him, even though (like Lobachevsky) he states it only for continuous functions of a real variable.
Similarly, Lavine observes that:
Because Lobachevsky and Dirichlet have been credited as among the first to introduce the notion of an arbitrary correspondence, this notion is sometimes referred to as the Dirichlet or Lobachevsky-Dirichlet definition of a function. A general version of this definition was later used by Bourbaki (1939), and some in the education community refer to it as the "Dirichlet–Bourbaki" definition of a function.
Dedekind.
Dieudonné, who was one of the founding members of the Bourbaki group, credits a precise and general modern definition of a function to Dedekind in his work
"Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen", which appeared in 1888 but had already been drafted in 1878. Dieudonné observes that instead of confining himself, as in previous conceptions, to real (or complex) functions, Dedekind defines a function as a single-valued mapping between any two sets:
The logician's "function" prior to 1850.
Logicians of this time were primarily involved with analyzing syllogisms (the 2000 year-old Aristotelian forms and otherwise), or as Augustus De Morgan (1847) stated it: "the examination of that part of reasoning which depends upon the manner in which inferences are formed,
and the investigation of general maxims and rules for constructing arguments". At this time the notion of (logical) "function" is not explicit, but at least in the work of De Morgan and George Boole it is implied: we see abstraction of the argument forms, the introduction of variables, the introduction of a symbolic algebra with respect to these variables, and some of the notions of set theory.
De Morgan's 1847 "FORMAL LOGIC OR, The Calculus of Inference, Necessary and Probable" observes that " logical truth depends upon the "structure of the statement", and not upon the particular matters spoken of"; he wastes no time (preface page i) abstracting: "In the form of the proposition, the copula is made as abstract as the terms". He immediately (p. 1) casts what he calls "the proposition" (present-day propositional "function" or "relation") into a form such as "X is Y", where the symbols X, "is", and Y represent, respectively, the "subject", "copula", and "predicate." While the word "function" does not appear, the notion of "abstraction" is there, "variables" are there, the notion of inclusion in his symbolism "all of the Δ is in the О" (p. 9) is there, and lastly a new symbolism for logical analysis of the notion of "relation" (he uses the word with respect to this example " X)Y " (p. 75) ) is there:
In his 1848 "The Nature of Logic" Boole asserts that "logic . . . is in a more especial sense the science of reasoning by signs", and he briefly discusses the notions of "belonging to" and "class": "An individual may possess a great variety of attributes and thus belonging to a great variety of different classes" . Like De Morgan he uses the notion of "variable" drawn from analysis; he gives an example of "represent the class oxen by "x" and that of horses by "y" and the conjunction "and" by the sign + . . . we might represent the aggregate class oxen and horses by "x + y"".
In the context of "the Differential Calculus" Boole defined (circa 1849) the notion of a function as follows:
The logicians' "function" 1850–1950.
Eves observes "that logicians have endeavored to push down further the starting level of the definitional development of mathematics and to derive the theory of sets, or classes, from a foundation in the logic of propositions and propositional functions". But by the late 19th century the logicians' research into the foundations of mathematics was undergoing a major split. The direction of the first group, the Logicists, can probably be summed up best by – "to fulfil two objects, first, to show that all mathematics follows from symbolic logic, and secondly to discover, as far as possible, what are the principles of symbolic logic itself."
The second group of logicians, the set-theorists, emerged with Georg Cantor's "set theory" (1870–1890) but were driven forward partly as a result of Russell's discovery of a paradox that could be derived from Frege's conception of "function", but also as a reaction against Russell's proposed solution. Zermelo's set-theoretic response was his 1908 "Investigations in the foundations of set theory I" – the first axiomatic set theory; here too the notion of "propositional function" plays a role.
George Boole's "The Laws of Thought" 1854; John Venn's "Symbolic Logic" 1881.
In his "An Investigation into the laws of thought" Boole now defined a function in terms of a symbol "x" as follows:
Boole then used "algebraic" expressions to define both algebraic and "logical" notions, e.g., 1−"x" is logical NOT("x"), "xy" is the logical AND("x","y"), "x + y" is the logical OR("x", "y"), "x"("x"+"y") is "xx"+"xy", and "the special law" "xx" = "x"2 = "x".
In his 1881 "Symbolic Logic" Venn was using the words "logical function" and the contemporary symbolism ( x = f(y), y = f−1(x), cf page xxi) plus the circle-diagrams historically associated with Venn to describe "class relations", the notions "'quantifying' our predicate", "propositions in respect of their extension", "the relation of inclusion and exclusion of two classes to one another", and "propositional function" (all on p. 10), the bar over a variable to indicate not-x (page 43), etc. Indeed he equated unequivocally the notion of "logical function" with "class" "set": "... on the view adopted in this book, f(x) never stands for anything but a logical class. It may be a compound class aggregated of many simple classes; it may be a class indicated by certain inverse logical operations, it may be composed of two groups of classes equal to one another, or what is the same thing, their difference declared equal to zero, that is, a logical equation. But however composed or derived, f(x) with us will never be anything else than a general expression for such logical classes of things as may fairly find a place in ordinary Logic".
Frege's "Begriffsschrift" 1879.
Gottlob Frege's Begriffsschrift (1879) preceded Giuseppe Peano (1889), but Peano had no knowledge of until after he had published his 1889. Both writers strongly influenced . Russell in turn influenced much of 20th-century mathematics and logic through his "Principia Mathematica" (1913) jointly authored with Alfred North Whitehead.
At the outset Frege abandons the traditional "concepts "subject" and "predicate"", replacing them with "argument" and "function" respectively, which he believes "will stand the test of time. It is easy to see how regarding a content as a function of an argument leads to the formation of concepts. Furthermore, the demonstration of the connection between the meanings of the words "if, and, not, or, there is, some, all," and so forth, deserves attention".
Frege begins his discussion of "function" with an example: Begin with the expression "Hydrogen is lighter than carbon dioxide". Now remove the sign for hydrogen (i.e., the word "hydrogen") and replace it with the sign for oxygen (i.e., the word "oxygen"); this makes a second statement. Do this again (using either statement) and substitute the sign for nitrogen (i.e., the word "nitrogen") and note that "This changes the meaning in such a way that "oxygen" or "nitrogen" enters into the relations in which "hydrogen" stood before". There are three statements:
Now observe in all three a "stable component, representing the totality of relations"; call this the function, i.e.,
Frege calls the argument of the function "sign [e.g., hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen, regarded as replaceable by others that denotes the object standing in these relations". He notes that we could have derived the function as "Hydrogen is lighter than . . .." as well, with an argument position on the "right"; the exact observation is made by Peano (see more below). Finally, Frege allows for the case of two (or more arguments). For example, remove "carbon dioxide" to yield the invariant part (the function) as:
The one-argument function Frege generalizes into the form Φ(A) where A is the argument and Φ( ) represents the function, whereas the two-argument function he symbolizes as Ψ(A, B) with A and B the arguments and Ψ( , ) the function and cautions that "in general Ψ(A, B) differs from Ψ(B, A)". Using his unique symbolism he translates for the reader the following symbolism:
Peano 1889 "The Principles of Arithmetic" 1889.
Peano defined the notion of "function" in a manner somewhat similar to Frege, but without the precision. First Peano defines the sign "K means "class", or aggregate of objects", the objects of which satisfy three simple equality-conditions, "a = a", ("a = b") = ("b = a"), IF (("a = b") AND ("b = c")) THEN ("a = c"). He then introduces φ, "a sign or an aggregate of signs such that if "x" is an object of the class "s", the expression φx denotes a new object". Peano adds two conditions on these new objects: First, that the three equality-conditions hold for the objects φx; secondly, that "if "x" and "y" are objects of class "s" and if "x" = "y", we assume it is possible to deduce "φx = φy"". Given all these conditions are met, φ is a "function presign". Likewise he identifies a "function postsign". For example if "φ" is the function presign "a"+, then "φx" yields "a"+"x", or if "φ" is the function postsign +"a" then "xφ" yields "x"+"a".
Bertrand Russell's "The Principles of Mathematics" 1903.
While the influence of Cantor and Peano was paramount, in Appendix A "The Logical and Arithmetical Doctrines of Frege" of "The Principles of Mathematics", Russell arrives at a discussion of Frege's notion of "function", "...a point in which Frege's work is very important, and requires careful examination". In response to his 1902 exchange of letters with Frege about the contradiction he discovered in Frege's "Begriffsschrift" Russell tacked this section on at the last moment.
For Russell the bedeviling notion is that of "variable": "6. Mathematical propositions are not only characterized by the fact that they assert implications, but also by the fact that they contain "variables". The notion of the variable is one of the most difficult with which logic has to deal. For the present, I openly wish to make it plain that there are variables in all mathematical propositions, even where at first sight they might seem to be absent. . . . We shall find always, in all mathematical propositions, that the words "any" or "some" occur; and these words are the marks of a variable and a formal implication".
As expressed by Russell "the process of transforming constants in a proposition into variables leads to what is called generalization, and gives us, as it were, the formal essence of a proposition ... So long as any term in our proposition can be turned into a variable, our proposition can be generalized; and so long as this is possible, it is the business of mathematics to do it"; these generalizations Russell named "propositional functions"". Indeed he cites and quotes from Frege's "Begriffsschrift" and presents a vivid example from Frege's 1891 "Function und Begriff": That "the essence of the arithmetical function 2"x"3 + "x" is what is left when the x is taken away, i.e., in the above instance 2( )3 + ( ). The argument "x" does not belong to the function but the two taken together make the whole". Russell agreed with Frege's notion of "function" in one sense: "He regards functions – and in this I agree with him – as more fundamental than predicates and relations" but Russell rejected Frege's "theory of subject and assertion", in particular "he thinks that, if a term "a" occurs in a proposition, the proposition can always be analysed into "a" and an assertion about "a"".
Evolution of Russell's notion of "function" 1908–1913.
Russell would carry his ideas forward in his 1908 "Mathematical logical as based on the theory of types" and into his and Whitehead's 1910–1913 "Principia Mathematica". By the time of "Principia Mathematica" Russell, like Frege, considered the propositional function fundamental: "Propositional functions are the fundamental kind from which the more usual kinds of function, such as "sin "x"" or log x or "the father of x" are derived. These derivative functions . . . are called "descriptive functions". The functions of propositions . . . are a particular case of propositional functions".
Propositional functions: Because his terminology is different from the contemporary, the reader may be confused by Russell's "propositional function". An example may help. Russell writes a propositional function in its raw form, e.g., as "φŷ": ""ŷ" is hurt". (Observe the circumflex or "hat" over the variable "y"). For our example, we will assign just 4 values to the variable "ŷ": "Bob", "This bird", "Emily the rabbit", and ""y"". Substitution of one of these values for variable "ŷ" yields a proposition; this proposition is called a "value" of the propositional function. In our example there are four values of the propositional function, e.g., "Bob is hurt", "This bird is hurt", "Emily the rabbit is hurt" and ""y" is hurt." A proposition, if it is significant—i.e., if its truth is determinate—has a truth-value of "truth" or "falsity". If a proposition's truth value is "truth" then the variable's value is said to satisfy the propositional function. Finally, per Russell's definition, "a "class" is all objects satisfying some propositional function" (p. 23). Note the word "all'" – this is how the contemporary notions of "For all ∀" and "there exists at least one instance ∃" enter the treatment (p. 15).
To continue the example: Suppose (from outside the mathematics/logic) one determines that the propositions "Bob is hurt" has a truth value of "falsity", "This bird is hurt" has a truth value of "truth", "Emily the rabbit is hurt" has an indeterminate truth value because "Emily the rabbit" doesn't exist, and ""y" is hurt" is ambiguous as to its truth value because the argument "y" itself is ambiguous. While the two propositions "Bob is hurt" and "This bird is hurt" are "significant" (both have truth values), only the value "This bird" of the "variable" "ŷ" "satisfies"' the propositional function "φŷ": ""ŷ" is hurt". When one goes to form the class α: "φŷ": ""ŷ" is hurt", only "This bird" is included, given the four values "Bob", "This bird", "Emily the rabbit" and ""y"" for variable "ŷ" and their respective truth-values: falsity, truth, indeterminate, ambiguous.
Russell defines functions of propositions with arguments, and truth-functions "f(p)". For example, suppose one were to form the "function of propositions with arguments" p1: "NOT(p) AND q" and assign its variables the values of "p": "Bob is hurt" and "q": "This bird is hurt". (We are restricted to the logical linkages NOT, AND, OR and IMPLIES, and we can only assign "significant" propositions to the variables "p" and "q"). Then the "function of propositions with arguments" is p1: NOT("Bob is hurt") AND "This bird is hurt". To determine the truth value of this "function of propositions with arguments" we submit it to a "truth function", e.g., "f(p1)": "f"( NOT("Bob is hurt") AND "This bird is hurt" ), which yields a truth value of "truth".
The notion of a "many-one" functional relation": Russell first discusses the notion of "identity", then defines a descriptive function (pages 30ff) as the unique value "ιx" that satisfies the (2-variable) propositional function (i.e., "relation") "φŷ".
Russell symbolizes the descriptive function as "the object standing in relation to "y"": R'y =DEF ("ιx")("x R y"). Russell repeats that ""R'y" is a function of "y", but not a propositional function ; we shall call it a "descriptive" function. All the ordinary functions of mathematics are of this kind. Thus in our notation "sin "y"" would be written " sin " 'y" ", and "sin" would stand for the relation sin " 'y" has to "y"".
The formalist's "function": David Hilbert's axiomatization of mathematics (1904–1927).
David Hilbert set himself the goal of "formalizing" classical mathematics "as a formal axiomatic theory, and this theory shall be proved to be consistent, i.e., free from contradiction" . In "The Foundations of Mathematics" he frames the notion of function in terms of the existence of an "object":
Hilbert then illustrates the three ways how the ε-function is to be used, firstly as the "for all" and "there exists" notions, secondly to represent the "object of which proposition holds", and lastly how to cast it into the choice function.
Recursion theory and computability: But the unexpected outcome of Hilbert's and his student Bernays's effort was failure; see Gödel's incompleteness theorems of 1931. At about the same time, in an effort to solve Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem, mathematicians set about to define what was meant by an "effectively calculable function" (Alonzo Church 1936), i.e., "effective method" or "algorithm", that is, an explicit, step-by-step procedure that would succeed in computing a function. Various models for algorithms appeared, in rapid succession, including Church's lambda calculus (1936), Stephen Kleene's μ-recursive functions(1936) and Alan Turing's (1936–7) notion of replacing human "computers" with utterly-mechanical "computing machines" (see Turing machines). It was shown that all of these models could compute the same class of computable functions. Church's thesis holds that this class of functions exhausts all the number-theoretic functions that can be calculated by an algorithm. The outcomes of these efforts were vivid demonstrations that, in Turing's words, "there can be no general process for determining whether a given formula "U" of the functional calculus K ["Principia Mathematica"] is provable"; see more at Independence (mathematical logic) and Computability theory.
Development of the set-theoretic definition of "function".
Set theory began with the work of the logicians with the notion of "class" (modern "set") for example , Jevons (1880), , and . It was given a push by Georg Cantor's attempt to define the infinite in set-theoretic treatment (1870–1890) and a subsequent discovery of an antinomy (contradiction, paradox) in this treatment (Cantor's paradox), by Russell's discovery (1902) of an antinomy in Frege's 1879 (Russell's paradox), by the discovery of more antinomies in the early 20th century (e.g., the 1897 Burali-Forti paradox and the 1905 Richard paradox), and by resistance to Russell's complex treatment of logic and dislike of his axiom of reducibility (1908, 1910–1913) that he proposed as a means to evade the antinomies.
Russell's paradox 1902.
In 1902 Russell sent a letter to Frege pointing out that Frege's 1879 "Begriffsschrift" allowed a function to be an argument of itself: "On the other hand, it may also be that the argument is determinate and the function indeterminate . . .." From this unconstrained situation Russell was able to form a paradox:
Frege responded promptly that "Your discovery of the contradiction caused me the greatest surprise and, I would almost say, consternation, since it has shaken the basis on which I intended to build arithmetic".
From this point forward development of the foundations of mathematics became an exercise in how to dodge "Russell's paradox", framed as it was in "the bare [set-theoretic] notions of set and element".
Zermelo's set theory (1908) modified by Skolem (1922).
The notion of "function" appears as Zermelo's axiom III—the Axiom of Separation (Axiom der Aussonderung). This axiom constrains us to use a propositional function Φ(x) to "separate" a subset MΦ from a previously formed set M:
As there is no universal set—sets originate by way of Axiom II from elements of (non-set) "domain B" – "...this disposes of the Russell antinomy so far as we are concerned". But Zermelo's "definite criterion" is imprecise, and is fixed by Weyl, Fraenkel, Skolem, and von Neumann.
In fact Skolem in his 1922 referred to this "definite criterion" or "property" as a "definite proposition":
van Heijenoort summarizes:
In this quote the reader may observe a shift in terminology: nowhere is mentioned the notion of "propositional function", but rather one sees the words "formula", "predicate calculus", "predicate", and "logical calculus." This shift in terminology is discussed more in the section that covers "function" in contemporary set theory.
The Wiener–Hausdorff–Kuratowski "ordered pair" definition 1914–1921.
The history of the notion of "ordered pair" is not clear. As noted above, Frege (1879) proposed an intuitive ordering in his definition of a two-argument function Ψ(A, B). Norbert Wiener in his 1914 (see below) observes that his own treatment essentially "revert(s) to Schröder's treatment of a relation as a class of ordered couples". considered the definition of a relation (such as Ψ(A, B)) as a "class of couples" but rejected it:
By 1910–1913 and "Principia Mathematica" Russell had given up on the requirement for an intensional definition of a relation, stating that "mathematics is always concerned with extensions rather than intensions" and "Relations, like classes, are to be taken in "extension"". To demonstrate the notion of a relation in extension Russell now embraced the notion of "ordered couple": "We may regard a relation ... as a class of couples ... the relation determined by φ("x, y") is the class of couples ("x, y") for which φ("x, y") is true". In a footnote he clarified his notion and arrived at this definition:
But he goes on to say that he would not introduce the ordered couples further into his "symbolic treatment"; he proposes his "matrix" and his unpopular axiom of reducibility in their place.
An attempt to solve the problem of the antinomies led Russell to propose his "doctrine of types" in an appendix B of his 1903 "The Principles of Mathematics". In a few years he would refine this notion and propose in his 1908 "The Theory of Types" two axioms of reducibility, the purpose of which were to reduce (single-variable) propositional functions and (dual-variable) relations to a "lower" form (and ultimately into a completely extensional form); he and Alfred North Whitehead would carry this treatment over to "Principia Mathematica" 1910–1913 with a further refinement called "a matrix". The first axiom is *12.1; the second is *12.11. To quote Wiener the second axiom *12.11 "is involved only in the theory of relations". Both axioms, however, were met with skepticism and resistance; see more at Axiom of reducibility. By 1914 Norbert Wiener, using Whitehead and Russell's symbolism, eliminated axiom *12.11 (the "two-variable" (relational) version of the axiom of reducibility) by expressing a relation as an ordered pair "using the null set. At approximately the same time, Hausdorff (1914, p. 32) gave the definition of the ordered pair (a, b) as { {a,1}, {b, 2} }. A few years later Kuratowski (1921) offered a definition that has been widely used ever since, namely { {a, b}, {a} }". As noted by "This definition . . . was historically important in reducing the theory of relations to the theory of sets.
Observe that while Wiener "reduced" the relational *12.11 form of the axiom of reducibility he "did not" reduce nor otherwise change the propositional-function form *12.1; indeed he declared this "essential to the treatment of identity, descriptions, classes and relations".
Schönfinkel's notion of "function" as a many-one "correspondence" 1924.
Where exactly the "general" notion of "function" as a many-one correspondence derives from is unclear. Russell in his 1920 "Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy" states that "It should be observed that all mathematical functions result form one-many – contemporary usage is many-one relations . . . Functions in this sense are "descriptive" functions". A reasonable possibility is the "Principia Mathematica" notion of "descriptive function" – "R 'y" =DEF (ι"x")("x R y"): "the singular object that has a relation "R" to "y"". Whatever the case, by 1924, Moses Schonfinkel expressed the notion, claiming it to be "well known":
According to Willard Quine, "provide for ... the whole sweep of abstract set theory. The crux of the matter is that Schönfinkel lets functions stand as arguments. For Schönfinkel, substantially as for Frege, classes are special sorts of functions. They are propositional functions, functions whose values are truth values. All functions, propositional and otherwise, are for Schönfinkel one-place functions". Remarkably, Schönfinkel reduces all mathematics to an extremely compact "functional calculus" consisting of only three functions: Constancy, fusion (i.e., composition), and mutual exclusivity. Quine notes that Haskell Curry (1958) carried this work forward "under the head of combinatory logic".
Von Neumann's set theory 1925.
By 1925 Abraham Fraenkel (1922) and Thoralf Skolem (1922) had amended Zermelo's set theory of 1908. But von Neumann was not convinced that this axiomatization could not lead to the antinomies. So he proposed his own theory, his 1925 "An axiomatization of set theory". It explicitly contains a "contemporary", set-theoretic version of the notion of "function":
At the outset he begins with "I-objects" and "II-objects", two objects "A" and "B" that are I-objects (first axiom), and two types of "operations" that assume ordering as a structural property obtained of the resulting objects ["x", "y"] and ("x", "y"). The two "domains of objects" are called "arguments" (I-objects) and "functions" (II-objects); where they overlap are the "argument functions" (he calls them I-II objects). He introduces two "universal two-variable operations" – (i) the operation y: ". . . read 'the value of the function "x" for the argument "y" . . . it itself is a type I object", and (ii) the operation ("x, y"): ". . . (read 'the ordered pair x, y') whose variables "x" and "y" must both be arguments and that itself produces an argument ("x, y"). Its most important property is that "x"1 = "x"2 and "y"1 = "y"2 follow from ("x"1 = "y"2) = ("x"2 = "y"2)". To clarify the function pair he notes that "Instead of "f"("x") we write ["f,x"] to indicate that "f", just like "x", is to be regarded as a variable in this procedure". To avoid the "antinomies of naive set theory, in Russell's first of all . . . we must forgo treating certain functions as arguments". He adopts a notion from Zermelo to restrict these "certain functions".
Suppes observes that von Neumann's axiomatization was modified by Bernays "in order to remain nearer to the original Zermelo system . . . He introduced two membership relations: one between sets, and one between sets and classes". Then Gödel in particular p. 35 where Gödel declares his primitive notions to be class, set, and "the diadic "relation ε" between class and class, class and set, set and class, or set and set". Gödel 1940 "The consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum hypothesis with the axioms of set theory" appearing on pages 33ff in Volume II of "Kurt Godel Collected Works", Oxford University Press, NY, ISBN 0-19-514721-9 (v.2, pbk).</ref> further modified the theory: "his primitive notions are those of set, class and membership (although membership alone is sufficient)". This axiomatization is now known as von Neumann-Bernays-Gödel set theory.
Bourbaki 1939.
In 1939, Bourbaki, in addition to giving the well-known ordered pair definition of a function as a certain subset of the cartesian product E x F, gave the following:
"Let E and F be two sets, which may or may not be distinct. A relation between a variable element x of E and a variable element y of F is called a functional relation in y if, for all x ∈ E, there exists a unique y ∈ F which is in the given relation with x.
"We give the name of function to the operation which in this way associates with every element x ∈ E the element y ∈ F which is in the given relation with x, and the function is said to be determined by the given functional relation. Two equivalent functional relations determine the same function."
Since 1950.
Notion of "function" in contemporary set theory.
Both axiomatic and naive forms of Zermelo's set theory as modified by Fraenkel (1922) and Skolem (1922) "define" "function" as a relation, "define" a relation as a set of ordered pairs, and "define" an ordered pair as a set of two "dissymetric" sets.
While the reader of "Axiomatic Set Theory" or "Naive Set Theory" observes the use of function-symbolism in the "axiom of separation", e.g., φ(x) (in Suppes) and S(x) (in Halmos), they will see no mention of "proposition" or even "first order predicate calculus". In their place are ""expressions" of the object language", "atomic formulae", "primitive formulae", and "atomic sentences".
In 1954, Bourbaki, on p. 76 in Chapitre II of Theorie des Ensembles (theory of sets), gave a definition of a function as a triple "f" = ("F", "A", "B"). Here "F" is a "functional graph", meaning a set of pairs where no two pairs have the same first member. On p. 77 ("op. cit.") Bourbaki states (literal translation): "Often we shall use, in the remainder of this Treatise, the word "function" instead of "functional graph"."
Relational form of a function.
The reason for the disappearance of the words "propositional function" e.g., in , and , is explained by together with further explanation of the terminology:
For his part Tarski calls the relational form of function a "FUNCTIONAL RELATION or simply a FUNCTION". After a discussion of this "functional relation" he asserts that:

RNE Radio 5

RNE Radio 5 is an "all news" radio station operated by Radio Nacional de España, part of Spain's state-owned public broadcasting organization, Corporación de Radio y Televisión Española (RTVE). It began broadcasting in 1994, following a reorganization of public radio services in that year.
Its format is similar to that of the French rolling-news service France Info (founded in 1987), with news bulletins on the hour and half-hour and summaries at 15 and 45 minutes past each hour, largely interspersed with short features covering a wide variety of topics, including science, health, culture, economics, and history as well as analysis of matters currently in the news.
Overnight, between 0.00 and 8.00, Radio 5 carries the programmes of RNE Radio Nacional; it also relays all or part of Radio Nacional's main news broadcasts: "Las mañanas de RNE" (Mon-Fri at 8.00); "Diario de las 2" (at 14.00); and "24 horas" (at 20.00). The station's schedule includes "regional disconnections" at various points in the day for local news bulletins, with longer regional programmes being broadcast at 13.10–14.00 (13.30–14.00 at weekends) and 19.30–20.00 (Mon-Fri).
Radio 5 inherited most of the AM and FM transmitter network which had until 1988 carried the programmes of the state-owned but commercially financed Radio Cadena Española; today, however, the station – like all of RTVE's radio and television channels – is commercial-free.

Giant's Quoit

The Giant's Quoit () is one of an ancient and rare group of monuments and can be found at Carwynnen in Cornwall. The monument includes a portal dolmen, and is also known as the 'Carwynnen Quoit', 'The Giant's Quoit', 'The Giant's Frying Pan', 'Pendarvis Quoit' and 'Pendarves Quoit' and is situated on a gentle west-facing slope between two small tributaries to the Red River.
The five acre site is currently owned by The Sustainable Trust. It is a megalith belonging to the Neolithic period, possibly 5000 years old, one of the few Cornish portal dolmens to be found outside the Penwith peninsula. The site was first recorded by the Welsh antiquarian Edward Lhuyd around 1700 and a symbol of the cromlech appeared on Martyn’s 1748 map of Cornwall. These are early references to ancient sites. The first plan and elevation was by Cornish antiquarian William Borlase in 1769. In 1840 the field was recorded as the Frying Pan Field on the Tithe Apportionment Schedule.
The portal dolmen survives as a collapsed chamber originally formed by a capstone and three upright stones which stood to a height of 1.5m. It collapsed in the 19th century. The chamber was rebuilt by Lady Pendarves, but collapsed again in 1967. The capstone measures approximately 3.3m long by 2.5m wide and 0.3m thick, and weighs approximately 10 tons. Two of the former supports, up to 2.7m long, now rest on top of it with the third lying beneath. Further stones surrounding the portal dolmen are the result of field clearance. It was first described and sketched by Borlase in the 18th century.
In 1891 it was recorded that "curious marks" had been noticed some years previously, "on a stone under a thorn tree, on the site of what seems to be a walled barrow, about 100 yards north of Carwynnen Quoit. The OS found no trace of the supposed walled barrow or interesting stonework in this area in 1971.
Despite having collapsed and some disturbance by cultivation, the Giant's Quoit at Carwynnen is still one of a rare group of monuments. In September 2012 an archaeological dig took place after a preliminary investigation in July 2012. During the winter of 2012, the findings from the dig are getting collated, and it is hoped in 2013, from the results of the dig, the Quoit will be re-erected for future generations to study, explore and enjoy. 
Troon Primary School in September 2012 was the first School to be involved in a pilot archaeological week based on an education pack drawn up in 2009. During this time there was also an Open Day for the community at large to learn about the monument and archeology. Findings from the dig were on display for all to see and the event was televised. A website called the Giant's Quoit is currently under construction and will showcase the finds, explain archaeological evidence and present the restoration process.

Andrews plot

In data visualization, an Andrews plot or Andrews curve is a way to visualize structure in high-dimensional data.
Each data point formula_1 defines a finite Fourier series:
formula_2
This function is then plotted for formula_3. Thus each data point may be viewed as a line between formula_4 and formula_5. This formula can be thought of as the projection of the data point onto the vector:
formula_6
If there is structure in the data, it may be visible in the Andrews' curves of the data.
These curves have been utilized in fields as different as biology, neurology, sociology and semiconductor manufacturing. Some of their uses include the quality control of products, the detection of period and outliers in time series, the visualization of learning in artificial neural networks, and correspondence analysis.

Abdullah Baqui

Abdullah Baqui is a public health scientist who identified culturally appropriate, simple, feasible, and affordable and cost-effective intervention/strategies for reduction of preventable maternal and newborn deaths through community-based research.
Personal life and education.
Baqui was born and grew up in Gopalganj district in Bangladesh. His father Md. Abdus Salam was an Advocate (Lawyer) in Gopalganj district. Baqui graduated from Dhaka Medical College in 1976, and completed his Masters studies in Public Health (MPH) and Doctorate in Public Health (DrPH) from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, US, in 1985 and in 1990 respectively.
Career.
Baqui joined the Bloomberg School of Public Health in 2000. Before joining the school, he served as a project director and a program head at ICDDR,B in Bangladesh and worked on research related to newborn and child health, infectious diseases, urban health, micronutrients, and other nutritional problems. He became a Professor in the Department of International Health in Bloomberg School of Public Health in Johns Hopkins University in 2009. He has more than 30 years of experience in designing community based interventions, conducting clinical and community trials, large-scale program evaluations and setting up surveillance and surveys. 
Public health research works.
Baqui is one of those few public health scientists who confirmed effectiveness of simple but effective strategies to reduce preventable newborn deaths. 
In last 3 decades, Baqui's research works confirmed: (a) the use of zinc supplementation during diarrhea to reduce the severity of child mortality. (b) the effectiveness of trained community health workers providing home based health care to reduce neonatal mortality by one-third. and (c) use of Hib vaccination in Bangladesh to reduce the incidence of meningitis and X-ray documented pneumonia in children. 
Each of these studies has resulted in influencing policy decisions. For example, WHO and UNICEF have now recommended the use of zinc as an adjuvant therapy for diarrheal episode. National Neonatal Health Strategy in Bangladesh has been developed in 2009. More recently a WHO-UNICEF joint statement recommends home visits by trained community health worker as a strategy to improve neonatal survival.
Baqui has been leading the PROJAHNMO study group in Bangladesh since its inception in 2002. Results of the PROJAHNMO studies demonstrating the effectiveness of home-based care by CHWs and effectiveness of chlorhexidine umbilical cord care in reducing neonatal mortality substantially contributed to the design of newborn programs in many developing countries of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. 
He has currently active projects in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Malawi, and Tanzania. His current research interests include design and evaluation of health interventions to improve health and survival of mothers and children, particularly newborn babies and evaluation of preventive and curative health service programs in low- and middle-income countries. 
His other interests are related to the use of evidence in policy and programs, including the development of research capacity and the strengthening of public health training and education. As a member of advisory bodies of several international organizations, he assists with the development of policies intended to improve public health, particularly health of mothers and children. He also serves as an honorary editorial consultant of the "Lancet" and as a member of the editorial board of the "Journal of Health Population and Nutrition", "FACTS-Reports", and the "Open Public Health Journal". He also served as a reviewer for several other peer-reviewed journals, including "American Journal of Epidemiology", "American Journal of Public Health", "Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal", and "Bulletin of the World Health Organization".
Honors and awards.
In May 2012, the CORE Group honored Baqui with the Dory Storms Child Survival Recognition Award. 
Baqui also received 'Recognition Award' from Bangladesh Medical Association in North America
Publications.
Baqui has authored about 170 scientific articles published in peer-reviewed journal and many other reports, working papers and policy briefs.
His seminal article published in Lancet in 2008 on effectiveness of home delivery strategy for delivering newborn health care package by using community health workers was named as the "Paper of the year 2008 published in Lancet".

Jennifer Anson

Jennifer Anson (born March 5, 1977 in New York, United States) is from the Republic of Palau. She is a judoka.
At the 2012 Summer Olympics Jennifer Anson competed in the Women's 63 kg, but was quickly defeated in the initial elimination round of 32. Anson was on her back and out almost as soon as her first fight had started, overwhelmed by a far superior and younger Mongolian opponent, Munkhzaya Tsedevsuren. In only 46 seconds, the 26 year old Mongolian pummeled and strangled Anson resulting in an Ippon, or technical knockout, and a perfect score of 110 to 0, the highest possible score in judo. The strangling technique used is called okuri eri jime.
The bout has been described as a cameo Olympic appearance for Anson that ended in a flash. The 46 second round was the shortest contest in the elimination round of 32 which entitled Anson to be one of London 2012's "unusual athletes". After the match, Anson stated that, "when I was out there, everything blacked out in my head" and the fight was over before she could think of what to do. It is unclear if this was the result of the strangling or a panicked athlete, but Anson did say that, “when the fight started, I forgot everything. I wanted to be defensive-minded but still trying to be aggressive. All of sudden I was on the mat and the fight was lost.” 
Anson's quick defeat is attributed to her inexperience as she filled a quota slot for Oceania after finishing 86th out of 178 places. At 35 years, she was also the oldest competitor among the 24 contestants in the 63k category, followed by 33 year old Elisabeth Willeboordse of the Netherlands. The majority of the Olympic athletes were in their 20's. After the stunning upset, Anson explained that she intended to set an example for younger members of her judo club in Palau of which there are 10 members with 40 kids learning the sport.

Maybe This Christmas

Maybe This Christmas is a holiday compilation album released in November 2002 through Nettwerk Records featuring contemporary musicians performing both classic and original Christmas songs. The album is the first in a series, named by Ron Sexsmith, of three holiday compilations released through the record label between 2002 and 2004. A portion of the proceeds from each album in the series went to Toys for Tots, a charity supported by the United States Marine Corps. Most of the tracks exclusive to "Maybe This Christmas" were recorded just a few months prior to its release. The album's cover art was designed by artist Paul Frank, creator of Julius the pictured "wide-mouth monkey". Critical reception of the compilation was mixed, with reviewers often complimenting or criticizing select tracks. In the United States, the album reached a peak position of number thirty-eight on "Billboard" Top Holiday Albums chart.
Background and composition.
"Maybe This Christmas" is the first in a series of three consecutive holiday compilation albums released through Nettwerk. "Maybe This Christmas Too?" and "Maybe This Christmas Tree" were released in October 2003 and October 2004, respectively. The series was named by Ron Sexsmith, who contributed the title track to the compilation. A portion of proceeds from all three albums went to Toys for Tots, a charity supported by the United States Marine Corps. "Maybe This Christmas" contains thirteen "rock-oriented" tracks recorded by various artists. Most of the tracks exclusive to the album were recorded just a few months prior to its release. Allmusic's MacKenzie Wilson dubbed the compilation as an "album suited for those twenty-somethings searching for not-so-typical Christmas collection." The cover art was designed by artist Paul Frank, creator of Julius the "illustrated, wide-mouth monkey".
The album opens with Phantom Planet's "sweet rock romp" rendition of Felix Bernard and Richard B. Smith's "Winter Wonderland". Sexsmith's title track is less than minutes in length and has a shuffling beat. "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" (Ralph Blane, Hugh Martin) features a downtempo, "jazz-like" solo piano performance by Chris Martin of Coldplay. Exclusive tracks to the album include Vanessa Carlton's piano-driven rendition of the traditional song "Greensleeves" as well as Bright Eyes' cover of "Blue Christmas" (Bill Hayes, Jay Johnson); others include Sense Field's version of John Lennon and Yoko Ono's "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" and "What a Year for a New Year" by Dan Wilson, lead singer of the rock band Semisonic. 
Jimmy Eat World's "12/23/95", described by "The Austin Chronicle" Christopher Gray as "serious emo" and "The New York Times" Kelefa Sanneh as a "gentle ballad of apology", previously appeared on the band's 1999 album "Clarity". The song title and date refer to Little Christmas Eve, the traditional day in which Norwegians decorate Christmas trees. Jack Johnson incorporates a "upbeat street-corner" shuffle into his version of "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer" (Johnny Marks, Robert L. May), just over two minutes in length. The traditional song "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen" is performed as a duet by the Barenaked Ladies and Sarah McLachlan. Following is a string of original songs, including "Bizarre Christmas Incident" by Ben Folds, "What a Year for a New Year" by Dan Wilson) and Neil Finn's "Sweet Secret Peace". "Winter Wonderland," "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" and "Bizarre Christmas Incident" were recorded previously for fans but had not been released commercially. The closing track, "Snow" (Archibald Lampman, Loreena McKennitt) was performed by McKennitt and has been described as a "haunting, orchestral new-age hymn that could fit nicely into a midnight Mass."
Reception.
"Maybe This Christmas" received mixed critical reception. Many reviewers complimented or criticized select tracks, though Jimmy Eat World's "12/23/95" received the most praise. Allmusic's MacKenzie Wilson awarded the album three out of five stars and described it as a "solid holiday effort" for both "casual and die-hard music fans". Wilson considered "12/23/95" the standout track of the album and wrote that performances by Bright Eyes, Loreena McKennitt, Sense Field and Dan Wilson provided traditional carols with "fresh face" along with their own "dash of coolness". She also complimented Coldplay's rendition of "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas", calling it as "endearing" as the original, and thought Sarah McLachlan's "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen" was "playfully charming". Christopher Gray of "The Austin Chronicle" considered "Blue Christmas" the best and "Bizarre Christmas Incident" the "funniest" track on the compilation. 
Chris Willman of "Entertainment Weekly" gave the album a "B" rating and called it a "mixed bag". He described performances by Vanessa Carlton and Bright Eyes as "painful" but also complimented the Barenaked Ladies and McLachlan for their collaboration. Willman considered Wilson's "What a Year for a New Year" the stand-out track of the album. Annie Zaleski of "The Phoenix" rated the album 2.5 out of 4 stars, calling some of the collection "gorgeous and alluring" but most of it "subdued". Zaleski complimented the title track but criticized performances by Coldplay and Bright Eyes, the latter for its "unsteady, wobbly twang". Zaleski and Kelefa Sanneh of "The New York Times" also praised "12/23/95". Zaleski concluded: "Not exactly your traditional take on traditional holiday fare, but a pleasant alternative to all the muzak you have to put up with this time of year."

Silas Leachman

Silas Field Leachman (20 August 1859 – 28 April 1936) was an American pioneer recording artist, possibly the first person to make recordings in Chicago and known for making hundreds of thousands of phonograph cylinder recordings in the 1890s.
He was born in Louisville, Kentucky, and worked on the railroad before marrying and moving to Chicago in the 1880s. Around 1891, he started recording cylinders for various companies, making his first recordings for the Chicago Talking Machine Company. He later recorded for Columbia and, after 1901, Victor. According to a report first published in the "Chicago Tribune" in 1895, he recorded in a wide range of styles, often under assumed names, and by that time claimed to have personally produced almost 250,000 cylinders. The report sets out in detail Leachman's work, at the very start of the recording industry:
"Away out in the extreme northwestern part of the city, near the Milwaukee Railroad tracks, Silas Leachman puts in four or five hours every day singing at the top of his lungs, though not a soul is in hearing but his wife. When he gets tired of singing, he varies the proceedings by preaching a negro sermon, or gives an imitation of an Irish wake, and altogether conducts himself in a way that would lead the neighbors to consider him a fit subject for a lunatic asylum — if there were any neighbors, but there are not.<br>This is the very reason Mr. Leachman chose the lonely spot for his residence. No one ever goes out there to hear him sing, and yet he is getting rich at it. He earns something over $50 every day, though he never sees one of his auditors. Mr. Leachman sings for phonographs, and, as he has a monopoly of the business in the West, he contrives to keep busy, and has even been heard to express a wish that he were twins. He has better protection in his monopoly than a copyright or an injunction, or unlimited legal talent could afford. Nature gave him the peculiar qualities that enable him to reproduce his voice perfectly on the wax cylinders. Hundreds of persons have attempted to break in on his profitable monopoly, but the results of their efforts put an effectual stop to their attempts. And so Mr. Leachman goes on enjoying the monopoly and reaping the profits thereof.<br>There are four other men in the East that also do work for the phonograph; but while they have to have a man to play the piano while they sing, another to make the announcement, another to change the cylinders, and a fourth to keep the machines in order, Mr. Leachman is the entire show in himself. Furthermore, he can give an unlimited number of impersonations, while the other four men are limited to a few specialties each. Mr. Leachman is a natural mimic, and therein lies the secret of his success. He sings ballads, negro melodies, and Irish, Chinese and Dutch dialect songs. He plays his own accompaniment on the piano and takes care of the machines. He prepares three "records", as the wax cylinders are called, at one time.<br>To do this three phonographs are placed near the piano, with the horns at one side pointing away from the keyboard at an angle of forty-five degrees. The horns have to be placed very carefully, for a fifth of an inch makes a great difference in the tone the cylinders will reproduce. When the horns have been adjusted exactly right, Mr. Leachman seats himself at the piano, and, turning his head away over his right shoulder, begins to sing as loud as he can, and that is pretty loud, for he is a man of powerful physique, and has been practicing loud singing for four years. He has been doing this work until his throat has become calloused so that he no longer becomes exhausted after singing a short time.<br>As soon as he has finished one song, he slips off the wax cylinders, puts on three fresh ones without leaving his seat, and goes right on singing until a passing train compels him to stop for a short time. In the four years he has been in the business he has made nearly 250,000 records. So great is the demand for them that he cannot fill his orders. It is such exceedingly hard work that he cannot sing more than four hours a day. He gets thirty-five cents for every cylinder that he prepares. He has a repertoire of four hundred and twenty pieces, and his work is put on the market under a score of names. He has a remarkable memory, and, after once hearing a song, cannot only repeat the words and music correctly, but can imitate excellently the voice and expression of the singer."
A baritone, he became best known for "coon songs" - stereotypical portrayals of African American life - although little regard was paid to the quality of the performances themselves. His popular recordings included "Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me a Bow Wow" (1892), "Dem Golden Slippers" (1894), "I Guess I'll Have To Telegraph My Baby" (1899), and "Bill Bailey, Won't You Please Come Home?" (1902).
He continued to record in the early years of the new century, but by 1920 worked as a deputy sheriff. He eventually became Inspector of Personnel for the Chicago Police. He died in Chicago in 1936 at the age of 76.

Yoav Benjamini

Yoav Benjamini (born January 5, 1949) is an Israeli statistician best known for development of the “False Discovery Rate” (FDR) criterion.
Scientific fields of interest.
Benjamini's scientific work combines theoretical research in statistical methodology with applied research that involves complex problems with massive data. The methodological work is on selective and simultaneous inference (multiple comparisons), and centers on the “False Discovery Rate” (FDR) criterion, as well as on general methods for data analysis, data mining and data visualization. His current interest is the replicability problem in science: too often, the results of studies gaining headlines cannot be replicated by other experimenters.

Raphael (opera)

Raphael (full title: "Raphael: Musical Scenes from the Renaissance"; Russian: Рафаэль: Музыкальные сцены из эпохи Возрождения; Italian: "Raffaello"), "op." 37, is an opera in one act by Anton Arensky. The libretto, by A. A. Kryukov, is based on the life of the Renaissance artist Raphael. The opera was composed in 1894 for the First Congress of Russian Artists and dedicated to the Moscow Society of Lovers of the Arts. It premiered at the Moscow Conservatory on 6 May (old calendar: 26 April), with set-design by Leonid Pasternak; Yevgeniya Mravina took the role of Fornarina, Raphael's model and mistress. Arensky chose a work on non-Russian subject matter and distanced himself from the nationalistic tendencies of his teacher Rimsky-Korsakov. "Raphael" was less well-received than its predecessor, Arensky's first opera "Dream on the Volga".
Recordings.
There is a recording with the Philharmonia of Russia conducted by Constantine Orbelian on the Delos label, featuring Marina Domashenko in the title role (mezzo-soprano); Tatiana Pavlovskaya as Fornarina (soprano); Alexander Vinogradov as Cardinal Bibbiena (bass); and Vsevolod Grivnov as an off-stage folk-singer (tenor).

Wilmer Harris

Wilmer Joseph Harris (March 1, 1924 – December 23, 2004) was an African American pitcher who played in Negro league baseball. Listed at 6' 0", 175 lb., he batted and threw right handed.
Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Wilmer Harris started playing sandlot ball at an early age with the boys of his neighborhood. He attended Central High School for Boys, where he graduated in 1941. In addition, he served as captain for the school's baseball and basketball teams, and also played for the Passon Stars club of the Fairmount Park League, which won four straight championships.
Harris was known as having a fearsome curveball. He entered the league in 1945 with the Philadelphia Stars, playing for them his entire eight-year career through 1952. In his debut, he faced pitching legend Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Monarchs before a 40000 crowd in the original Yankee Stadium. Late in the year, he struck out Jackie Robinson, by then a rookie who was pinch-hitting for the Monarchs.
The highlight of his career came in 1946, while pitching against the Newark Eagles at Connie Mack Stadium. With the bases loaded and no outs, Harris struck out in order three of the greatest hitters in Negro League history: Larry Doby, Lennie Pearson and Monte Irvin, to preserve the victory for his team.
In 1947, after the Major League Baseball season ended, Harris played for an All-Star team led by Jackie Robinson, composed of Robinson and other Negro League relevant players. He ended his career with the Stars in 1952, posting a career total of 120 wins and 45 losses for a solid .727 winning percentage. 
A two-time NBL All-Star, Harris hurled the last three innings for the East Division in the 1951 East-West All-Star Game, allowing two hits without walks or runs while striking out four batters. He earned the save in a 3–1 victory. In 1952, his last season, he pitched again three innings of shutout ball in the East-West Game, surrendering two hits with a walk and did not have a strikeout in a 7–3 loss.
Besides this, he also played winter baseball in the professional leagues of Panama (1945), Venezuela (1949) and Dominican Republic (1950).
After retiring from baseball, he worked in Jenkintown for SPS Technologies during 37 years, retiring as a supervisor in 1989. He then was employed at Allied Securities Service in Pittsburgh for 12 years.
Wilmer Harris died in 2004 in his homeland of Philadelphia at the age of 80. At the time of his death, he was one of only five surviving members of the Philadelphia Stars.

Compressed air gramophone

Compressed air gramophones were gramophones which employed compressed air and a pneumatic amplifier to amplify the recorded sound.
One of the earliest versions was the Auxetophone, designed by the British engineer Sir Charles Parsons. It was capable of producing sufficient volume to broadcast public music performances from the top of the Blackpool Tower, and was said to be loud enough to cause people to vacate the front rows of seats in an auditorium.
A pneumatic amplifier was realised by using a sensitive valve, which required little force to operate, to modulate the flow of a stream of compressed air. The basic principle of the valves used in these devices was to pass the stream of compressed air through two partially overlapping combs. The sound vibrations to be amplified were applied to one of the combs, causing it to move laterally in relation to the other comb, varying the degree of overlap and so altering the flow of compressed air in sympathy with the sound vibrations.
Other compressed-air gramophones included the Chronomégaphone and the Elgéphone.

Graham Richard Ihlein (born 11 November 1951) is an Australian politician. He was an Australian Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1982 until 1985, representing the electorate of Sandringham.
Ihlein was born in the Sydney suburb of Lakemba, and attended Yagoona State School. His family later moved to Victoria, where he attended Morwell High School and studied law at Monash University. He worked as a research officer (1974-1975) and senior industrial officer (1975-1979) for the Australian Public Service Association, and was a federal industrial officer for the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association from 1979 until 1982. Ihlein had joined the Labor Party in 1975, had been the Sandringham campaign manager in 1979, and was a member of the party's economic policy committee from 1981 to 1982.
Ihlein was elected to the Legislative Assembly at the 1982 state election, winning the formerly safe Liberal seat of Sandringham. Sandringham had been held by the Liberal Party since its inception, and while the seat had become considerably more marginal since a 1976 redistribution, the incumbent Liberal MLA, Max Crellin, had held off Labor challenges in 1976 and 1979. Ihlein campaigned for eighteen months prior to the election, and focused heavily on retaining the Sandringham railway line, which had been threatened with closure under a report made for the previous government. The campaign proved to be successful, with Ihlein winning a narrow victory as the Cain Labor government won office statewide.
A redistribution prior to the 1985 election made Sandringham notionally Liberal again. Ihlein instead contested and lost Evelyn to Liberal Jim Plowman, while Ihlein staffer and future federal MP Ann Corcoran contested and lost Sandringham.

Design and development.
While flight testing the Light Combat Helicopter, a modified version of HAL Dhruv, the Indian Army came to the conclusion that without making any major modifications to the Dhruv air-frame, an armed variant can also be developed and delivered to the army quickly. This variant was named "Rudra".
The Rudra underwent integration trial for armament and electro-optical systems and a final round of weapon firing trials in September 2011, which included testing of the 20-mm turret gun. The 70 mm rockets and MBDA Mistral air-to-air missiles were tested in November 2011. The helicopter exceeded the payload and performance requirements at the height of 6 km. It has integrated sensors, weapons and electronic warfare suite, and uses an upgraded version of the glass cockpit used in the HAL Dhruv Mk-III. The sensors include stabilised day and night cameras, infrared imaging as well as laser ranging and designation. It has an Integrated Defensive Aids Suite (IDAS) from SAAB, with electronic warfare self-protection which is fully integrated into the glass cockpit. On-board self-defence systems include radar & missile detectors, IR jammer, chaff and flare dispensers. The helicopter can be used in both unarmed and armed roles that include reconnaissance, troop transport, anti-tank warfare and close air support.
In September 2012, ground tests for the first production Rudra were completed. It featured a turret gun, rockets, air-to-air missiles and could carry air-to-ground missiles like the anti-tank helicopter-launched Nag. HAL was awarded with a combined order of 76 "Rudra"s for the Indian army, the primary customer, and the Indian air force. It was reportedly that the weapons platforms and avionics of HAL Rudra and the under-development Light Combat Helicopter would be the same.
The Indian Navy conducted flight trials in 2012-13, and found the helicopter suitable for coastal surveillance operations. It was impressed with the capability of the Rudra's sensors to track ships at 12 and 14 km. The image quality of the sensors was described as good enough to even read the name of ships at those ranges, and the navy was keen to order at least 20 helicopters.
Service history.
Initial Operational Clearance (IOC) was expected by late 2012 and deliveries of production helicopters were to start by 2013. On 4 February 2013 during Aero India, the HAL Rudra Mk-IV achieved IOC, and two helicopters were handed over to the army.
Variants.
Rudra, or ALH-WSI (Weapon Systems Integrated) has two main versions.

Brain Storm (comics)

Brain Storm is a DC Comics supervillian, enemy of the Justice League. He first appeared in Justice League of America #32(December, 1964) and was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Mike Sekowsky.
Fictional character biography.
Axel Storm had created a special helmet that allowed him to absorb stellar energy, which he could use to create virtually anything with his imagination could conceive. This invention having warped his mind, Brain Storm witnessed his brother Fred's apparent death. In his twisted ideals, Brain Storm had captured the Justice League so that they could witness him taking justice into his own hands and killing the man responsible for his brother's demise. Part of his plan involved stealing the powers and abilities from the Justice League members and redistributing them to random people.
However, a side effect to Brain Storm's power was that whoever the power was used upon could also access the energy abilities and the JLA members were suddenly mentally linked to the people who had gained their abilities. Transporting them to Brain Storm's base, their arrival freed the Justice League from Brain Storm's trap and they fought against him.
They battled a group of stellar-energy powered threats, and came to realize who it was that Brain Storm blamed for his brothers death - the Green Lantern. However, Green Lantern explained that due to Brain Storm's interference with his attempt to capture Fred (who just robbed a bank), the combination of both their powers transported Fred to France and erased his memories.
Bringing Fred to them and restoring his memory, the Justice League convinced Brain Storm to end his vendetta against the Green Lantern. However, Brain Storm realized that escape was the best course of action and teleported away without a trace, leaving the JLA to turn his brother over to the police.
Brain Storm soon returned however to plague the League once again. This time, he used his powers to give each team member a severe physical disability. Superman was struck blind, Flash's legs were fused together, Green Arrow suddenly had no arms, Green Lantern began to stutter both literally and mentally, and Hawkman developed breathing problems. In spite of these handicaps, the JLA managed to overcome the odds and fight back against Brain Storm. After the battle, Brain Storm restored all the JLA members back to normal.
Brain Storm retaliated though and used his power to create duplicates of himself. He also succeeded in capturing the League, turning all but Batman into his drone slaves. Finally determining which foe was the real Brain Storm, Batman knocked him out, relinquishing his control over the JLA members.
Some years later, Brain Storm turned up again, this time without the benefit of his powers. He kidnapped the Terrorsmith in the hopes of using his powers to reactivate his own lost abilities. This plan proved unsuccessful however, and the Terrorsmith was able to escape.
Brain Storm, or someone dressed like Brain Storm, was one of many costumed villains who attended Roulette's "House of Pain", although he did not participate in any of the exhibition events. It is unclear whether this was actually Brain Storm himself, or perhaps one of the other spectators who enjoyed dressing up as a famous super-villain.
The New 52.
A new Brainstorm debuted against Michael Holt, but is not related to the original. He is Dominic Lanse, a silicon valley scientist who was working on downloading unique intellects into machines. His success was reversed by an accident that let him reverse the process and transfer those intellects into himself. But Mister Terrific is able to supercharge his mind with the T-Spheres rendering him unconscious. Is also revealed that this version is indirectly responsible for Holt's wife death.

Oliver Plunkett Street

Oliver Plunkett Street ("Sráid Olibhéir Pluincéid" in Irish), is the second most important shopping street in Cork, Ireland after St. Patrick's Street. In addition to being an important shopping street, it is one of the principal nightlife centres in Cork, although there are actually more bars and restaurants in the neighbouring sidestreets than on Oliver Plunkett St.
The street runs in a straight line from Custom House Street to Grand Parade. 
Between Grand Parade and Parnell Place, the street is a major shopping street. With the exception of the secondary entrance to the Penneys department store, most retailers on the street are small standalone retailers, but there are a number of chain retailers that operate smaller stores too, such as Newbridge Silverware and Leonidas. This section of the street is also home to Cork's main Post Office. A small lane, known as Market Lane, provides access to the English Market.
Between Parnell Place and Custom House Quay, the street is known as Lower Oliver Plunkett Street. It is largely flanked by office buildings, derelict plots and the back entrance to two hotels. The aree was formerly known as a location of street prostitution, but the pedestrianization of nearby Lapp's Quay has seen this decline. The legacy of the sex trade can still be seen by the presence of some sex shops on this section of the street.
Pedestrianisation.
A number of the side streets between Oliver Plunkett Street and St. Patrick's Street are permanently pedestrianized. Along with neighbouring streets, the section of Oliver Plunkett Street between Parnell Place and Grand Parade is pedestrianized between 10:30am and 4:30pm every day. Automatic bollards are installed at the junction with Parnell Place and also at the junctions of Princes St and South Mall, Pembroke St and Phoenix St and Maylor St and St. Patrick's Street, to create a large pedestrianised area.

List of compositions by Peter Warlock

Peter Warlock was the pseodonym adopted by the British composer and music scholar Philip Arnold Heseltine (1894–1930). He wrote over a hundred songs, a number of choral works and a small number of instrumental pieces. His general style has been summarised by his biographer Barry Smith as "an idiosyncratic harmonic language that comprise an unusual mixture of Edwardiana, Delius, Van Dieren, Elizabethan and folk music, features that give his music a strongly personal voice". In addition to his own compositions he made transcriptions of Elizabethan and Jacobean vocal solo, choral, and instrumental works, and prepared an edition of Henry Purcell's string fantasias.
For choral works the acronym "SATB" (Soprano-Alto-Tenor-Bass) has been used to indicate the voice composition of the work. Divisions of individual voice parts are indicated by "SSAA..." etc.

Ezekiel Stone Wiggins

Ezekiel Stone Wiggins (December 4, 1839 – August 14, 1910) was a Canadian weather and earthquake predictor known as the "Ottawa Prophet". He was the author of several scientific, educational and religious works.
Early life and education.
Ezekial Wiggins was born in Grand Lake, Queens County, New Brunswick, in 1839 to Daniel Slocum Wiggins and Elizabeth Titus Stone, both of United Empire Loyalist descent. The Wiggins family claims descent from Capt Thomas Wiggins of Shrewsbury, England who became the first Governor of New Hampshire in 1630.
Ezekiel was a pupil at the Oakwood Grammar School (1858). He attended secondary school in Ontario, and stayed to become a teacher in Mariposa Township, Ontario. On August 2, 1862, he married his sixteen year old cousin Susan Anna Wiggins, the daughter of Vincent White Wiggins and Charlotte E. Wiggins. The couple did not have any children. Their religion was Episcopal. Susan became an author and poet. He was a student at the Philadelphia University of Medicine and Surgery, where he earned a MD in 1867-69. He earned a Bachelor of Arts from Albert University, in Belleville, Ontario in 1870, while serving as the head master of a highschool in Ingersoll, Ontario.
Career and theories.
Wiggins wrote "The Architecture of the Heavens", which was published in Montreal by John Lovell in 1864.
He worked as a local superintendent of schools in 1866.
In 1867, Wiggins wrote a criticism about Universalism in Christianity "Universalism unfounded": being a complete analysis and refutation of the system which was published in Napanee, Ontario by Henry & Co. in 1867 According to the preface, "Here every Orthodox minister and private Christian is furnished with a text book on Universalism. Containing a complete refutation of every position, hithero assumed either in the affirmative of niversal salvation or the negative of punishment"
Wiggins served as the first principal (1872–1874) of W. Ross Macdonald School, whose motto is "the impossible is only the untried". The school, which opened its doors in Brantford, Ontario in March 1872, provides instruction from kindergarten to secondary school graduation for blind and deafblind students. Wiggins wrote "English Grammar," which was published by Copp, Clarks & Co, Toronto in 1874.
Wiggins founded Thompson's School in 1874, a boy's day school housed upstairs in Whelpley Hall near the Rothesay railway station, in Rothesay, an affluent suburb of the prosperous city of Saint John, New Brunswick.
Wiggins, who was an amateur Cryptozoologist, argued in "Days of the Creation" published in the St. John New Brunswick Globe on July 1876 that Plesiosaurus dilichodeirus, genus of large marine Sauropterygian reptile that lived in the Oolitic era was not extinct, based on reported sightings by passengers and crew of the Steamer New York, of a marine animal swimming with its head twelve feet above the water near Boston. He later theorized that "That the Plesiosaurus exists in Rice Lake is certain and it is probably twenty feet in length," 
In 1876, the Wiggins advertised their summer home, consisting of Hunting Lodge dwelling, guests’ house, wood, ice, and bath house on a wilderness property on the west shore of the Grand Lake, New Brunswick.
Wiggins was an amateur historian who wrote "The History of Queens County" New Brunswick in a series of articles in the Saint John newspaper, The Watchman, in the fall and winter of 1876 and 1877. "The History of Queens County" by E. Stone Wiggins was edited by Richard and Sandra Thorne and was published in 1993 by the Queens County Historical Society, Saint John, New Brunswick.
He ran unsuccessfully in 1878 to represent Queen's (New Brunswick electoral district), which was a federal electoral district in New Brunswick, Canada, that was represented in the Canadian House of Commons. The Wiggins collection of "Scraps concerning Queen's County election, Sept. 17th, 1878" is in Library and Archives Canada.
He was appointed federal civil servant in the finance department by Sir John A. Macdonald in 1878. He continued to serve as a federal civil servant until 2 years before his death. From 1878-1892, the couple lived at 237 Daly Avenue, in Ottawa, Ontario. From 1892–93, the couple lived at Arbour House in Britannia, Ottawa.
Wiggins wrote the "Architecture of the Heavens containing a new theory of the universe and the extent of the deluge, and testimony of the Bible and geology in opposition to the views of Dr. Colenso". Wiggins’ theorized that storms, unusual tides, earthquakes and cyclones were all caused by planetary attraction, and that both visible and invisible planets could shift the Earth’s centre of Gravity. He claimed to have predicted the 1869 Saxby Gale. He claimed that the sun was merely an electric light, which did not generate any heat.
In 1901-02, Wiggins served as rector's warden at St. Stephen's Anglican Church (Ottawa).
Wiggins theorized that the unusual proximity of Jupiter to the Earth and the action of the Earth's moon upon Jupiter were responsible for the cold weather Canada experienced in the winter of 1904.
Although Wiggins discovered Earth's second moon in 1882, it was reported in "The Comber Herald" in 1907 that astronomers were unable to verify the discovery.
Wiggins' prophecies about storms and earthquakes, which were based on his astronomical calculations, appeared in "Wiggins' storm herald, with almanac, 1883" and in his warning letters reprinted in various newspapers.
Wiggins predicted a number of storms in February 1883. The "Auckland Star" reported that Wiggins' prediction of a storm on the Atlantic March 7, 1883 came to pass "A severe gale, accompanied by a heavy fall of snow, has been experienced over the greater part of England. Much damage has been caused on land by the wind and snowdrifts, and many disasters at sea are reported owing to the severity of the gale which raged along the coast."
Wiggins predicted that a great storm would strike Earth between the March 9–11, 1883 with a theatre of its ravages India, the south of Europe, England and North America, and leading to the submerging of the lowlands of the Atlantic. He predicted that no vessel smaller than a Cunarder would be able to live in this tempest. Wiggins predicted that a great Hurricane and Tidal Wave would strike America on March 9, 1883.
Wiggins advised the Canadian Minister of Marine and Lords of Admiralty that all vessels should be in safe harbours not later than March 5 since minor storms precede great ones. Some Canadians accorded the prophet credit for having made a fair prediction based on a severe storm on the 7th of March, a few days early of Wiggins' prediction of the 9th.
Wiggins explained that the severe snowstorm on March 7–8 was caused by one of planets moving into position to take part in great storm he predicted on 9th & 11 March. Wiggins predicted that the Northern Lights would precede his storm; The Aurora borealis was bright on March 8. On March 10 there was a light rain and hail followed by a gale in Halifax.
After the storm failed to appear at Montreal, Quebec; Ottawa, Ontario, Halifax, Nova Scotia and Toronto, Ontario on March 9 and 11, fishermen complained about the Fishing industry losses stemming from keeping the Fishing fleet in port.
The Hull, England Fishing fleet was hard hit in a storm on March 9, 1883, losing 37 vessels and leaving 500 families destitute. Sydney Australia suffered a northerly buster, which fell short of the tidal wave and hurricane predicted by Wiggins.
"If the storm does not come as predicted, Wiggins must go to the foot of the class. We shall have nothing to do with Canadian prophets. If we must have weather prophets we shall raise them ourselves and thus stimulate home industry" 
Wiggins lost credibility and was termed a "false prophet" and "a fool and his folly" since the storms were was not as terrible as Dr. Wiggins had predicted; Neither a great tidal wave nor a hurricane appeared. "This Wiggins, as a prophet, is a mushroom creation of American journalism and the ripe result of as shrewd a piece of inferential advertising as had laterly been attempted. He achieved fame in the sailing of one balloon." 
A cartoon by Grant Hamilton from the front page of the New York "Daily Graphic" on Jan 17, 1883 explained Wiggins' prophesies concisely. "The Great Wiggins shall the weather prophets or the people be snuffed out? Wiggins, the weather prophet prophesised 'We will have a terrible storm in March. ' The effect in a country town. This is a US signal service man trying with all the latest improved instruments to foretell the weather 48 hours he can but that is all. But Prof Wiggins has no difficulty to write with his left hand a letter foretelling the weather 3 to 6 months, with an extra month thrown in by way of variety. Prof W up in the wee ours of the night as the great storms occur in March - he prophesies and publishes it accordingly. '
Some of the Wiggin's predictions were fulfilled. He predicted, for example, the earthquake that appeared in England in 1884.
In 1885, Wiggins' retirement as a weather prophet was reported in "Once a Month". "The days of weather prophets are not yet over, despite the immense scientific advancements of meteorology – for who did not hear a year or so ago of "Wiggins" Predictions, and how fleets of ships actually remained in port in the United States, deterred from putting to sea by the Wiggins prophesy of terrific storms on the east coast of America? These storms did not come off and Wiggins retired into the shade" 
After the Charleston Earthquake of 1886, Wiggins announced that a more powerful disaster would occur at 2 p.m. on September 29; believers in North America panicked, quit work, and dressed in “ascension robes and waited for the end of the world. Wiggins theorized that"Earthquakes are caused by the shifting of the earth's centre of gravity. Suppose this centre of gravity to be moved, say one mile from her normal centre of gravity, or from her centre of volume; now, what must happen? Why, the parts of her surface at the end of the longer axis will be heavier and the parts at the end of the shorter axis will be lighter than normally. These disks, therefore, will grind upon each other, generating heat and lava. Hence earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. If our little visible satellite were brought down and slid around the earth from east to west, in 24 hours earthquakes would occur of such violence as to render our globe uninhabitable." Mark Twain wrote a humorous prophesy about Wiggins, which appeared in American and Canadian newspapers. "As meteor approaches Canada it will make a majestic downward swoop in the direction of Ottawa, affording a spectacle resembling a million inverted rainbows woven together, and will take the Prophet Wiggins right in the seat of his inspiration and lift him straight up into the back yard of the planet Mars, and leave him permanently there in an inconceivably mashed and unpleasant condition." Grip's cartoon about Wiggins' earthquake prophesy had an angry Charleston resident 'Stone Wiggins!' Grip also included the Modern Barney Buntline, a poem about Wiggins' predictions," ...When its only in an almanac it don't do so much harm, 'Cos they're limited to wind or rain or hail; But a special storm prediction causes seamen much alarm While Wiggins in a-wagging of his tail". Although the predicted earthquake and stormy weather did not take place in Charleston; there was an earthquake in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania and the Colima (volcano) erupted on Sept 29, 1886. He lost credibility since the earthquake and storms were not the 'greatest blow of the century' he had predicted.
Wiggins and gullible newspapers who carried his predictions were labelled cranks and fools in 1886. "A learned man may become a fool -by assuming the role of a "Weather Prophet" for instance. Wiggins and the crank who publishes and edits the Bradford Prophet are notable instances." Wiggins was advised to quit weather-propheting. "Give up weather-propheting, Mr. Wiggins, for you have proven on two occasions that you are not constituted for this line of business... Wiggins, you are about the most unmitigated and unabridged fizzle we ever heard of. In fact, you are no Weather-Prophet' American and Canadian newspapers published humorous poems 'The Modern Barney Buntline'; and humorous stories 'The weather prophet's lament' about Wiggins storm prophesy.
A. S. Hooker criticized Wiggins and other prophets in "Great earthquakes: their history, phenomena and causes", published by W.C. Regand, 1887
for their prediction methods, predictions which did not come to pass as well as predictions missed. Hooper though the Astronomy-based prediction methodology used by Wiggins and other prophets was weak "the observation, made since the Charleston earthquake, that E. Stone Wiggins, (that follower of Ananias) and other "prophets" had sprinkled their predictions so thickly along the meteorologic way, that it would be impossible for an earthquake or a storm to run amiss of one of them. " A. S. Hooker points out that Wiggins failed to predict the Charleston earthquake on 31 August 1886 or the aftershocks felt over a wide area of the United States in September, October and November. Wiggins also failed to predict a tornado which swept across the Gulf of Mexico on the 12th of October, 1886 which demolished the village of Sabine Pass, with a loss of 200 lives. A.S. Hooker notes that Wiggins changed his prediction for September 29, 1888 of a great storm of unparalleled violence which will sweep across the Atlantic ocean and traverse the country until exhausting its energies by the Rocky Mountains to an earthquake in the Gulf of Mexico and Central America, nevertheless, the 29th was a calm day without storm or earthquake. Hooker advised that Wiggins had received notice to quit prophesysing destructive storms, earthquakes and other natural disturbances, otherwise he will be dismissed from his position as a civil servant of the Dominion. Hooker wrote, "This is a great blow to Wiggins (not one that he prophesized), but a relief to those credulous, or nervously inclined. " 
Wiggins, an amateur Epidemiologist, theorized that the cause of a Yellow fever epidemic in Jacksonville, Florida in 1888 as astronomical. "The planets were in the same line as the sun and earth and this produced, besides Cyclones, Earthquakes, etc., a denser atmosphere holding more carbon and creating Microbes. Mars had an uncommonly dense atmosphere, but its inhabitants were probably protected from the fever by their newly discovered canals, which were perhaps made to absorb carbon and prevent the disease. " 
During an interview with The Times on December 7, 1888, Wiggins explained that he hoped the evidence from the eclipse of the sun on the 1st of January 1899, would prove his theories, which he'd held since 1864. He theorized that the phosphere of the sun is electricity, which repels and attracts comets through space by the law of like and unlike electricities. He believed that the coronal streamers are meteors carried through space on the trail of comets. He thought the ridges and lines on Mars observed through the Lick telescope were genuine Mars canals which had been excavated by the Martians for irrigation. He theorized that Encke comet must become a primary or secondary planet in a few years. If Encke comet became another moon to the Earth, Wiggins theorized that our oceans would raise 20 feet or more in a few hours. The flood would not only overwhelm both continents; Australia and the Gulf Stream would be no more. Wiggins theorized that floods and earthquakes are caused by dark or tailless comets, invisible through telescopes, passing near the Earth's surface.
Wiggins explained the discrepancies of the storms and earthquakes he predicted by his discovery of a dark second moon of the Earth, which he theorized deflected storms or interfered with earthquakes. The second satellite was termed dark because it eluded the telescopes or analytical spectroscopes of Astronomers.
On New Year's Day, 1889 Prof. Wiggins attended the Governor General of Canada reception at Ottawa. After being introduced to his Excellency The Marquess of Lansdowne and the Crown Ministers, Sir John A. Macdonald offered his hand, saying: "Why, Wiggins, you go by like a comet. " The professor replied: "Comets always go swiftly by the sun" and, later "He was greatly obliged to the Prime Minister for catching him at perihelion. " 
Prof. Wiggins was asked to comment by the New York Times on November 24, 1892 on an alleged collision between the Earth and a comet, reported by Prof. Snyder of Philadelphia. Prof Wiggins stated that no such collision occurred on November 24, 1892 since there was no comet near the Earth at the time of the collision. Prof Wiggins theorized that a Comet could not collide with the Earth because planets and comets are electrically positive and therefore repel each other, "If a comet were to strike the earth it would smash the comet into meteoric dust in twenty minutes. " 
Wiggins, a teacher, amateur meteorologist and his wife, writer Susie Anna Wiggins built "Arbour House", (1892–93) a Designated Heritage Property 1994, as their summer home in Britannia. Currently housing the Arbour House Studios, the corner tower, shingled gables and irregular plan are typical of the Queen Anne Revival-style.
Wiggins, wrote a science fiction novel, "Jack Suehard; or, Life on Jupiter" in 1891
The title is “Jack Suehard”; or “Life on Jupiter” which considered what the people of the earth will be like at the end of the next twenty millions of years. It featured a "‘stanlon,’ a mirror twenty feet square, which is in every house and a conspicuous object in every street of their cities, ” which provided instantaneous image transmission, essentially, “the Jovian newspaper, theatre, pulpit, and tribune. ” 
In 1893, Wiggins, predicted that the temperature in Canada was getting warmer in "The Newmarket Era": "In time orange trees will blossom on the banks of the St. Lawrence River and the present products of the Dominion will flourish on the shores of Hudson Bay." 
In 1895, Wiggins predicted in "The Newmarket Era" that the Great Lakes of North America are decreasing every year and the Niagara Falls will cease to be.
The 'Windsor Evening Record' reported on September 25, 1895 on popular feeling when the Wiggins weather predictions didn't come to pass, "Some people have lived in a state of great trepidation since the 17th, owing to the prophesy of E. Stone Wiggins, and now that the storm has failed to connect these people are kicking. Unhappy Wiggins." 
In 1896, Wiggins claimed in the "Newmarket era" that a tornado in St. Louis, Missouri in 1896 was caused by the network of telegraph wires, and predicted that a similar fate would befall Canadian cities unless all wires were buried.
In 1897, he claimed that a meteorite that fell near Binghamton, New York in November of that year contained a message from the inhabitants of the planet Mars in the form of hieroglyphs and advanced the theory that such messages had been sent before. He suggested that the Martians sent such meteorites to Earth by utilizing an "electric force", launching the projectiles towards passing comets which would draw the meteorite to Earth, or by launching the projectile into an orbit which would put it ahead of the Martian satellite Phobos, postulating that the "highly electrified" projectile would be repelled by Phobos with enough force to send it to Earth.
E. Stone Wiggins served as Commodore of the Britannia Bay Boathouse Club in 1899.
Society photographer William James Topley photographed Wiggins and his wife Mrs. E. Stone Wiggins in 1907.
Wiggins theorized that the cold and wet summer of 1909, resulted from an unrecognized satellite of the Earth 
He died on August 14, 1910 in Arbour House, Britannia at age 70. The couple's gravestone at St Luke Anglican Church Cemetery, Young's Cove Road, Queen's County, New Brunswick reads "Professor E. Stone Wiggins B.A., M.A., M.D., L.L.D. Canada's Distinguished Scientist and Scholar. DEC. 4 1839—AUG. 14 1910. His wife Susie.
"The Un-Canadians", an 2007 article in Beaver Magazine, includes Ezekiel Stone Wiggins, Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst, and Robert Monckton in a list of people in the history of Canada who were considered contemptible: "Civil servant and author Ezekiel Stone Wiggins manipulated the people's obsession with the weather and forecasted a storm that never came." 
Family.
Susan Anna Wiggins was born on April 6, 1846. She was privately educated in Latin and Greek. At 16, she married her cousin, "Ezekiel Stone Wiggins". Using her pen name of 'Gunhilda', Susan Anna was an author and poet.
In 1881, Susan Anna Wiggins used the nom de plume 'Gunhilda' to write the "Gunhilda Letters—Marriage with a Deceased Husband's Sister: Letters of a Lady to Travers Lewis, the Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of Ontario", which consisted of letters of support for Mr. Girouard's bill regarding the legalization of marriage with a deceased wife's sister. The Gunhilda Letters were dedicated to the members of the Senate of Canada and of the House of Commons of Canada who supported Mr. Girouard's Bill.
Nicholas Flood Davin complimented the Gunhilda letters "for felicity of expression, cogency of reasoning, fierceness of invective, keenness of satire and piquancy of style" and "Nothing equal to them has appeared in the Canadian press for years. " 
Sir David Lewis Macpherson invited Susan Anna Wiggins to take a seat on his right, on the day that the 'Gunhilda' bill received its second reading in the Red Chamber, Parliament of Canada; This honour was previously only accorded to men or to the wife of a Governor General of Canada. The artist, F.A.T Dunbar sculpted a bust of Susan Anna Wiggins, which was placed in the Canadian Parliamentary Library at Ottawa.
Mrs. Wiggins wrote a biography of her husband, Prof. E. Stone Wiggins.
In 1903, Mrs. Wiggins was included in Henry James Morgan's "Types of Canadian women and of women who are or have been connected with Canada: (Volume 1)", which was published by Briggs, Toronto in 1903. She died on May 6, 1921. Her obituary read, 'At all events, let us honor her, and remember her, the lone woman great, intellectual, marvelously well-read and cultured, a woman, who in her own way, stirred Canada as few women have ever stirred her'. She was buried with her husband in St. Luke's Anglican Church Cemetery, Youngs Cove, Queens County, New Brunswick, Canada.

German submarine U-257

German submarine "U-257" was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" during World War II. She was laid down at the Bremer Vulkan yard at Bremen-Vegesack on 22 February 1941 as 'werk' 22. She was launched on 19 November and commissioned on 14 January 1942 under the command of "Kapitänleutnant" Heinz Rahe.
"U-257" was assigned to the 5th U-Boat Flotilla for training, then transferred to the 3rd U-boat Flotilla for operational service.
She was sunk by Allied warships in mid-Atlantic in February 1944.
Service history.
The boat carried out six patrols, but did not sink or damage any ships. She was a member of seven wolfpacks.
1st patrol.
"U-256"s first patrol began on 21 September 1942 from Bergen in Norway. Her route took her across the North Sea, through the gap between the Faroe and Shetland Islands and into the Atlantic Ocean. She docked at La Pallice in occupied France, on 18 October.
2nd, 3rd and 4th patrols.
These sorties passed without major incident.
5th patrol.
The boat was attacked from the air twice in one day. "U-257", in the company of and was transitting the Bay of Biscay, outbound on 14 June 1943, when a Sunderland flying boat of 228 Squadron RAF unsuccessfully depth charged the three boats. In the afternoon, it was much the same story, but this time a Whitley from No. 10 OTU was involved. One man from the U-boat's crew was wounded. A second Whitley from the same unit arrived, but could only exchange fire with the submarine as it had expended all its depth charges in a previous engagement, the boat escaped.
6th patrol and loss.
The submarine had moved to St. Nazaire; she departed from this French Atlantic port on 2 January 1944. On 24 February, she was attacked and sunk in mid-Atlantic by the Canadian frigate , assisted by . (A former crew member from the "Waskesiu" has stated that "Nene" merely picked survivors up). Thirty men died in the sinking, there were nineteen survivors.

Maritime Resource Management (MRM)

Maritime Resource Management (MRM) is a human factors training programme aimed at the maritime industry. The MRM training programme was launched in 1993 - at that time under the name Bridge Resource Management - and aims at preventing accidents at sea caused by human error. 
In MRM training it is assumed that there is a strong correlation between the attitudes and behaviours of the seafarers on board a ship and the cultures that these seafarers belong to. The most relevant cultures in this respect being the professional, national and organizational cultures. Important target groups for MRM training are therefore, besides ships’ officers and crew, all people in shore organisations who have an influence on safety at sea and the work on board a ship.
Overview.
Definition of MRM.
The use and co-ordination of all the skills, knowledge, experience and resources available to the team to achieve the established goals of safety and efficiency of a voyage or any other safety critical task.
Target groups.
Ships’ officers, engineers, pilots and shore-based personnel.
Objectives of MRM training.
To motivate the team – if necessary – to change its behaviour to good resource management practices during everyday operations. This includes understanding of the importance of good management and teamwork and the willingness to change behaviour. An overall objective is to increase safety, efficiency and job satisfaction in shipping companies and, eventually, in the maritime industry as a whole.
Technical vs. non-technical training.
During everyday operation on board a ship, technical and non-technical skills are integrated into each other and both skills needed to perform tasks as safely and efficiently as possible. The technical skills are related to a specific department, job, function, rank or task. These are the skills traditionally focused on in the maritime industry and what has since long been covered in the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW). 
MRM is human factors training. This kind of training is sometimes referred to as "soft skills" training or "non-technical" training and was through the "Manila Amendments" introduced in the STCW. As opposed to technical training, non-technical training is generic, i.e. applicable to all. While most technical training has to be carried out with groups kept apart – divided into, for example, deck and engine – the non-technical training may be carried out with no separation of people at all. 
According to the MRM training concept, MRM training should be carried out as a separate training course without mixing it with technical issues. The purpose is to bring disciplines and ranks together in the same training class, providing them with the same course contents, terminology and training objectives. The aim is to tear down barriers between people, departments, ship and shore, open up for efficient communication and establish a genuine safety culture within the whole organisation.
Development of MRM.
The MRM training concept is developed from similar type of training carried out in the aviation industry. An important event that triggered resource management training in aviation was the Tenerife airport disaster - a collision on the runway of the Los Rodeos Airport on the island of Tenerife on 27 March 1977 between two Boeing 747 airliners. The accident resulted in the highest number of fatalities in aviation history – 583 people lost their lives. Contributing causes of this accident were; fog, stress, communication misunderstandings and a lack of monitoring and challenging errors. 
Resource Management training in the United States are usually traced back to 1979 when a workshop sponsored by NASA, "Resource Management on the Flightdeck", took place. This workshop was the result of NASA research into the causes of air transport accidents. Research presented at the workshop identified the human error aspects of the majority of air crashes as failures of interpersonal communications, decision making, and leadership. At this meeting, the label Cockpit Resource Management (CRM) was applied to the training of aircraft crews aiming at reducing "pilot error". 
In the beginning of the 1990s, eight entities gathered with the objective of converting the airline industry’s Cockpit Resource Management course to a course aimed at the maritime industry. These entities were: 
The first course, which was launched in June 1993, was called "Bridge Resource Management", or "BRM", because it was believed to be the most accurate translation of "Cockpit Resource Management". "The "cockpit" onboard a ship ought to be the "bridge"."
In 2003 the name of the course was changed from "Bridge Resource Management" to "Maritime Resource Management". The main purpose was to increase attraction amongst other important target groups besides masters, bridge officers and maritime pilots. Such target groups included engineers and shore-based personnel.
Before that, the aviation industry had changed the meaning of "CRM" from "Cockpit Resource Management" to "Crew Resource Management".
As of 2013, the further development of the Maritime Resource Management (MRM)™ training programme is assumed by the independent training development company ALL Academy International AB with the main purpose of reaching out to an even wider audience, inside and outside of the maritime industry.
Different course labels.
Since the launch of resource management training in the maritime industry, courses have emerged with similar names. Such names are Bridge Resource Management (BRM), Engine-room Resource Management (ERM), Vessel Resource Management (VRM), Crew Resource Management (CRM), Maritime Crew Resource Management (MCRM), etc.
Concerns.
There are concerns in the maritime industry, often expressed in internet-based discussion forums, that the large number of courses with similar names causes confusion and misunderstandings. Due to the lack of a uniform standard in the maritime industry, contents, concept and quality of training of these courses differ. A consequence could be that the initial objectives concerning safety improvements will not be met. In some courses the focus is more on technical issues than on non-technical issues which was not the intention when resource management training was first introduced in the maritime industry. Resource management training is sometimes also confused with Bridge Team Management (BTM) training which usually is a technical skills training course aimed at the deck department.
Focus of MRM training.
Training of seafarers are regulated through the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW). The STCW training requirements concern the seafarers, the people at the sharp end. At the sharp end we find the frontline operators, the people actually doing the task. The blunt end is further away from the action itself. The blunt end is the environment in which the seafarers work. Regulators, designers, shore-side owners and managers function at the blunt end.
Active errors and latent errors.
Active errors occur at the sharp end of the process. The effect of active errors are felt almost immediately. Active errors could be; making a course change at the wrong position, pushing an incorrect button, forgetting to close a valve. Latent errors occur at the blunt end. These are errors, removed in both time and space from the operators at the sharp end, that may lie dormant within the system for a long time. Examples of latent errors may include; equipment design flaws that make the human-machine interface less than intuitive, or organizational flaws, such as staffing and training decisions made for fiscal reasons increasing the likelihood of errors. Latent errors are often unrecognized and have the capacity to result in multiple types of active errors. 
Analyses of major accidents involving many different areas of society indicate that latent errors pose the greatest risk to safety in a complex system. Such accidents include Three Mile Island accident, Heysel Stadium disaster, Bhopal disaster, Chernobyl disaster, Space Shuttle "Challenger" disaster, King's Cross fire, "Piper Alpha" and MS "Herald of Free Enterprise".
Just culture.
The culture of the maritime industry has traditionally been characterised as a "blame culture" where seafarers risk not only dismissal but also criminal prosecutation for being involved in accidents. Recent examples of such accidents are the MV Erika and Hebei Spirit. To increase safety and facilitate the reporting and sharing of safety data, as required by the International Safery Management (ISM) Code, the industry has identified a need to move towards a "no blame culture" or a "just culture". The "just culture" term has gained in poupularity since "no blame" may be seen as "not accountable". The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has defined just culture as; "A culture in which frontline operators or others are not punished for actions, omissions or decisions taken by them that are commensurate with their experience and training, but where gross negligence, wilful violations and destructive acts are not tolerated." 
The target groups and objectives of MRM training extend beyond the requirements of the STCW Convention. MRM training focuses on both active and latent errors and has as an objective to establish a just culture across the maritime industry. Shore-side managers, accident investigators and regulators are therefore important target groups for MRM training.
Training providers.
MRM training providers include maritime universities and training centres, ship owners and ship managers, manning agencies, pilot associations and seafarer associations.
Training method.
Workshops.
The learning process in the MRM course takes place in workshops, one workshop per course module. 
In the workshops, conducted by a specially trained workshop leader, the trainees work together with 8-12 other trainees, sometimes in smaller groups. 
Case studies and situation analysis are performed, during which comparison between others’ and own attitudes and opinions are made. 
The MRM course is rather increasing the tendency, or willingness, to apply the skills than teaching the skills. This is a matter of changing attitudes.
Computer Based Training (CBT).
As a preparation for each workshop, the trainee learns basic facts about human behaviour and interaction. This is done by means of "computer based training", or "CBT". The CBT program also contains scripted drama examples of good and bad management situations. 
The CBT is carried out individually or in group.
Case studies.
An important part of the course is case studies of real accidents and incidents with analysis using "MRM terminology".
Facilitation techniques.
"Instruction" and "facilitation" are two main techniques that are available to trainers. Instruction is primarily a telling activity, where knowledge and skills are developed in trainees through either direct communication or demonstration. Facilitation on the other hand, can be described as a technique that helps trainees to discover for themselves what is appropriate and effective. 
Both techniques are useful and have their place. In order to transfer knowledge, instruction is the most efficient technique to employ. However, trying to encourage appropriate attitudes using instruction as the technique, normally has limited success. People, particularly adults, do not like being told how to behave and what to think. 
In MRM training, facilitation is the technique primarily used.
Refresher training.
Refresher training is considered a critical success factor for long-lasting results from resource management training. In the maritime industry this is most often done through shorter courses summarising the core MRM modules - focusing on recently added course material and analyses of recent accident cases. Shipping companies also refresh MRM contents during officer and crew conferences and in the daily communication with the ships.
STCW Manila Amendments.
Major revisions to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (the STCW Convention), and its associated Code were adopted at a Diplomatic Conference in Manila, the Philippines, on 21–25 June 2010. The amendments, to be known as “The Manila amendments to the STCW Convention and Code” entered into force on 1 January 2012 with full compliance by 1 January 2017. Amongst the amendments adopted, there are a number of important changes to the Convention and Code. 
The sections of the STCW Manila Amendments that contain requirements related to non-technical skills are:
On 14 February 2012, the Maritime Department of the Swedish Transport Agency certified that the MRM course meets the above mentioned requirements of the STCW 1978 Convention as
amended by the 2010 Manila Amendments.

<doc id="36596592" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36596592" title="Aging in the American workforce">
Aging in the American workforce

The aging workforce (also The Silver Tsunami) refers to the rise in the median age of the United States workforce, to levels unseen since the passage of the Social Security Act of 1935. It is projected that by the year 2020, about 25% of the U.S. workforce will be composed of older workers (ages 55 and over). While many factors contribute to the aging workforce, the Post-World War II baby boom created an unusually large birth cohort for the U.S. population, resulting in a large aging population today. This phenomena has many short-term and long-term implications, affecting many areas, including the U.S. economy, society and public health.
Baby boom and baby bust.
Starting in the years following World War II, from 1946 to 1964, about 78 million people were born in the United States, creating a large birth cohort known as the Baby boomers. In the generation following the Baby Boomers, from 1965 to 1976, came a substantially smaller generation, sometimes called a "baby bust." Due to the natural age progression of individuals, there is currently a large population of older Baby Boomers who are still in the workforce.
Projections.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of April 2014, the labor force participation rate was 62.8%. The overall labor force participation rate is expected to decline for the remainder of the decade, projected to fall to 62.5% in 2020. By the year 2020, the subpopulation of older adults in the United States is expected to reach 97.8 million people, comprising 28.7% percent of the entire U.S. population, a rise from the 24.7% in 2010. This increase in proportion of older adults can be attributed to the entire Baby Boomer cohort joining the older adult population (ages 55+) by 2020.
It is projected that by 2020, the proportion of the U.S. labor force that is composed of older adults will be 25.2%. This continues a trend in increasing rates of older adults remaining in the workforce, as the rates were 13.1% in 2000 and 19.5% in 2010. A complementary trend that follows this is the increasing median age of the U.S. workforce. By 2020, the workforce is expected to have a median age of 42.8, which will be an increase from 39.3 in 2000 and 41.7 in 2010.
A further factor contributing to an ageing workforce is the fact that employment rates among older workers are increasing. The rate of people who continue working after they are 65 is relatively high in the US, if compared to other developed countries. For example, in 2011, 16.7% among people aged 65 and over and 29.9% among 65-69 were employed in the US, while the corresponding rates in the EU were only 4.8 and 10.5%.
Impacts.
With continuing trends of an aging American workforce and a declining labor force participation rate, there may be many consequences arising from this phenomena. The impending repercussions from a large aging workforce entering retirement has led some to call this situation "The Silver Tsunami." The Silver Tsunami can have a profound effect on many areas of life.
Economy.
Due to a declining labor participation rate, there is expected to be a shortage of workers in the U.S. workforce. Projections show that the demand for labor needed now is not being fulfilled, and the gap between labor needed and labor available will continue to expand over the future. Owing to the differences in population size between the Baby Boomers and the following younger generations, there has been negative growth in the working age population. The retirement of members of the aging workforce could also possibly result in shortages of skilled labor. A majority of experienced utility workers and hospital caregivers, for example, will be eligible for retirement.
Social security benefits.
The U.S. federal social security system functions through the taxation of large numbers of young workers, in order to support smaller numbers of older dependents. A diminishing workforce, coupled with growing numbers of longer-living elderly can deplete the social security system. The Social Security Administration estimates that the old age dependency ratio (people ages 65+ divided by people ages 20–64) in 2080 will be over 40%, compared to the 20% old age dependency ratio in 2005. Increasing life expectancies of the older population will not only result in decreases in Social Security Benefits, but also devalues private and public pension programs. The dearth of funds supplying programs such as social security and Medicare may be a contributing factor for adults to delay retirement and to continue working.
Occupational safety and health.
Because of the many older adults opting to remain in the U.S. workforce, many studies have been done to investigate whether the older workers are at greater risk of occupational injury than their younger counterparts. Due to the physical declines associated with aging, older adults tend to exhibit losses in eyesight, hearing and physical strength. Data shows that older adults have low overall injury rates compared to all age groups, but are more likely to suffer from fatal and more severe occupational injuries. Of all fatal occupational injuries in 2005, older workers accounted for 26.4%, despite only comprising 16.4% of the workforce at the time. Age increases in fatality rates in occupational injury are more pronounced for workers over the age of 65. The return to work for older workers is also extended; older workers experience a greater median number of lost work days and longer recovery times than younger workers. Some common occupational injuries and illnesses for older workers include arthritis and fractures. Among older workers, hip fractures are a large concern, given the severity of these injuries.
Health care.
With larger numbers of older adults, there will be an increased need for geriatric care. Older adults will have to deal with more chronic diseases; older adults who have worked in the construction industry have shown high rates of chronic diseases. Experts suggest that the number of geriatricians will have to triple to meet the demands of the rising elderly. There is expected be a similarly increased demand in other healthcare professionals, such as nurses, physical therapists and dentists. In addition, there is expected to be an increasing demand over common geriatric care consumption needs, such as medications, joint replacements and cardiovascular operations.
Society.
The Silver Tsunami can potentially change American society as a whole. Many companies use an antiquated system, in which older, tenured workers get raises and benefits over time, eventually hitting retirement. With larger numbers of older workers in the workforce, this model is possibly unsustainable. In addition, perceptions of older adults in society will change, as the elderly are living longer lives and more active than before. Some state that society faces a cultural ageism in the perceptions about older adults, which will change over time.

Carter Capps

Carter Lewis Capps (born August 7, 1990) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball.
Early life and career.
Capps was a backup catcher at North Lenoir High School. He was converted to a pitcher in his freshman year at Mount Olive College. He posted a 24–1 record after two years (including an NCAA Division II-record of 24 straight wins) and pitched in the Cape Cod League as a relief pitcher for the Harwich Mariners.
He earned attention for a three-inning, five-strikeout performance on July 13, 2010, against Team USA's collegiate all-star team.
Professional career.
Seattle Mariners.
Capps was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the third round of the 2011 Major League Baseball Draft out of Mount Olive.
After an unspectacular 2011 debut at Class-A Clinton (1–1, 6.00 ERA in 18 innings), Capps improved dramatically with his performance as the closer for the AA Jackson Generals in 2012. Before being promoted to AAA Tacoma, Capps stuck out 72 hitters in 50 innings and posted 19 saves, along with a 1.26 ERA. He pitched only innings in AAA. For his performance with the Generals, Capps was named the best relief pitcher in the Southern League in 2012.
Capps was called up to the majors for the first time on July 31, 2012. He made his major league debut against the New York Yankees on August 3. His first recorded out was against Derek Jeter.
Capps was recalled by the Mariners on August 6, 2013.
Miami Marlins.
On December 13, 2013, the Mariners traded Capps to the Miami Marlins for Logan Morrison.
Pitching style.
Although his four-seam fastball was in the low 90s as a starter in college, it averages 99 mph out of the bullpen now. He pairs the hard fastball with a sweeping curveball at 81–85 mph and an occasional changeup against left-handed hitters.
With his tall frame, Capps releases the ball at a low-three quarters arm angle far to the side of the pitching rubber, making it difficult for right-handed hitters to pick up the ball out of his hand.

Aksel Jacobsen Bogdanoff

Aksel Jacobsen Bogdanoff (1922-1971), from Lille Ekkerøy, is noteworthy for two reasons. He was one of those Norwegians who fought as Soviet-controlled partisans in eastern Finnmark in World War II and, in 1953, he was one of two brothers who encountered and shot the last polar bear seen in Finnmark, at Lille Ekkerøy.
Part of the last generation to live on Lille Ekkeroy.
Aksel Jacobsen Bogdanoff was one of eleven children born to Signe Victoria Bogdanoff (1892-1963), née Dahl, from Tromsø, and Jacob Wilhelm Bogdanoff 
(1878-1940), whose father, as the surname suggests, came from Russia. The other children included: Alfred; Francis; Olaf (1917-2002); Karl; Frits; Ingvar (1920-1995), also known as Ingvald; Daniel; and Agnes. The children, three of whom died at an early age, were the last generation who lived on Lille Ekkerøy. They were evacuated during the war, moved to Krampenes, but returned and lived there until about 1953, when they moved back to Krampenes. The family had a bull, three cows, some sheep and a dog. As part of their subsistence tactics, they collected driftwood on the beach and picked cloudberries in the fields. 
Aksel married Anne Lise and, before their divorce, had a son called Arvid.
Partisan service.
After training as a radio operator in the Soviet Union, Bogdanoff, in April 1944, parachuted alone onto Kvaløya island and set up a radio bearing on the Torskefjord height between large stones. In connection with the Porsa action, he was captured and tortured by a German search party on 9 June 1944. He revealed nothing but he is supposed to have made some deal which the Germans honoured, resulting in his survival.
Polar bear.
In 1953, when Aksel Bogdanoff and Ingvald Bogdanoff were out inspecting their salmon nets in the Lille Ekkeroy area, they encountered a polar bear which is believed to have come on an ice-floe from Svalbard. They shot and killed the bear. This is the last time that a polar bear was seen in Finnmark.

No. 26 Squadron, Indian Air Force

No. 26 Squadron (Warriors) IAF, is a Ground Attack, and Close Air Support unit of the Indian Air Force, operating from an unknown base under Western Air Command.
History.
The squadron was formed on 1 January 1968, at Adampur, under Wing Commander M.M. Singh. It was the first squadron to operate the Sukhoi Su-7 aircraft. Until 1971, the squadron was a type training squadron, which helped other squadrons convert to Su-7. It played a very active role in the war with Pakistan in December that year. Its primary role was to fly Close Air Support missions with 8 Tactical Air Command, and flew a few sorties with 6 TAC as well. Most operations were in an area termed as the Bulge, bounded by Samba in the north, Pathankot in the east, and Dera Baba Nanak in the south.
Operations in 1971.
The war started with the PAF conducting pre-emptive strikes on various Indian airfields. At 0400 hours on the morning of 4 December, the Warriors' aircrew was briefed for its day's operations. It sent four aircraft, early in the morning, to strike Chander Airfield, and flew several other sorties. At dusk, four aircraft were sent to strike a suspected radar site at Walton Airfield. 
On 5 December, after being briefed at 0430 hours, the squadron flew missions for 6 TAC in the Lahore sector. In one mission, Squadron Leader Sahin was damaged, forcing him to land at Pathankot. During the last strike of the day, Squadron Leader Jaffa was shot. He ejected from an inverted aircraft, but landed inside Pakistani territory and got captured. The next day the squadron flew several missions against dug-in and well-prepared Pakistani positions in the Bulge. On 7 December, at 1015 hours, Squadron Leader Jiwa Singh, the squadron's Senior Flight Commander, was shot down in Jafarwal, and lost contact with ground control. Later that day, it was reported that s Su-7, probably commanded by Singh had been shot down by an F-104 Starfighter and the pilot killed. The next day, after being briefed at 0630hours, the squadron flew several CAS missions for no losses. However due to the previous mishaps, they were down to 13 pilots, and just 11 aircraft.
On 9 December, the squadron began flying missions with MiG 21s as escorts, since PAF activity in the Bulge had been stepped up. The squadron flew several missions against enemy positions in the Bulge, and Flight Lt. Kadam was reported missing after an attack on Rissalwala Airfield. The next day, the Warriors flew 10 CAS sorties in the bulge, and Flight Lt. Parulkar went missing after a strike over Zafarwal. On 11 December, 3 aircraft from the squadron flying over Nunkot, encountered 6 PAF Sabres. Two aircraft returned undamaged, but Flight Lt. K.K.Mohan was reported missing. The next day the squadron flew 12 CAS sorties for no mishaps, though the Pakistanis occasionally jammed the communications. As the war drew to close, the Warriors flew fewer sorties than before, only 8 sorties took place on 13 December.
On 14 December, the fight in Sakargarh began heating up, and the squadron flew 14 sorties. Their Flight Air Controller, Flight Lt. Pereira was seriously injured by strafing runs, and died due to these injuries. On 15 December, the Warriors acquired S-24 rockets, and attacked Sulaimanke Head works with these. The next day, after the Pakistani forces in Dhaka had surrendered, the squadron flew a mission against Normal Railway yard flying into heavy Anti-aircraft fire. Flight Lt. Dandass was shot down and his aircraft exploded on the ground. in the evening, the Prime Minister ordered a unilateral ceasefire on the Western Front. The next day, only 12 sorties were flown. A cessations of all air strikes was ordered at 1600 hours that evening.
Post-War.
The Squadron got several trophies for being the best in Western Air Command. They took part in the 50 squadron fly past in 1982, commemorating the IAF Golden Jubilee. At some point after the war, the squadron was re-equipped with MiG 21BIS aircraft.

Dunham continued to use several stylistic elements in his direction that he had observed in Lynch's work on "Pilot", including largely static camera work and the use of reddish color tints. The episode also marks the first appearance of Killer Bob, who was played by set decorator Frank Silva after Silva had been accidentally caught on camera.
"Episode 1" continued the investigation of the series' main plotline, the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), with Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Dale Cooper (MacLachlan) interviewing several suspects connected to the victim. The episode was viewed by approximately 14.9 million households upon its initial airing, which represented over a quarter of the available audience. Since its broadcast, the episode has earned positive reviews from critics.
Plot.
Background.
The small town of Twin Peaks, Washington, has been shocked by the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) and the attempted murder of her friend Ronette Pulaski (Phoebe Augustine). Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) has come to the town to investigate, and initial suspicion has fallen upon Palmer's boyfriend Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) and the man with whom she was cheating on Briggs, James Hurley (James Marshall).
Events.
Cooper takes breakfast at the Great Northern Hotel, enjoying a "damn fine cup of coffee" as Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) introduces herself and begins flirting with him. He makes his way to the sheriff's department, where he and Sheriff Truman (Michael Ontkean) discuss the day's plans. They interview Dr Hayward (Warren Frost) who has had an autopsy conducted on Palmer's body. They learn that Laura had had sex with at least three men the night she died.
Waitress Shelley Johnson (Mädchen Amick) is about to leave for work when her abusive husband Leo (Eric Da Re) demands she do more laundry. She finds a bloodstained shirt among Leo's clothes and hides it before he notices. However, he later realizes that it has gone missing. When she returns home that night, he questions her about its whereabouts, and savagely beats her with a bar of soap in a sock.
Cooper interviews Hurley about a video of Laura and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle); Hayward had denied him being present the day it was taken but Cooper notices a reflection of his motorcycle in the video. Cooper confronts Hurley about the affair he was having with Palmer, and about her cocaine habit. Hurley admits seeing Palmer the night she died but denies killing her. James' uncle Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) comes to the sheriff's department to pick his nephew up. Ed tells Truman that he was drugged the previous night at The Roadhouse, the town's bar; he suspects bartender Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) was responsible. Cooper takes a telephone call from his colleague Albert Rosenfield, who is on his way to aid the investigation. Meanwhile, Briggs and his friend Mike Nelson (Gary Hershberger) are in a jail cell, discussing money they owe to Leo. $10,000 they were meant to pay him is in a safe deposit box owned by Palmer, which they can now no longer access. They are later released by Cooper, who warns them not to approach James Hurley.
Josie Packard (Joan Chen) and Pete Martell (Jack Nance) discuss Packard's trouble with her sister-in-law Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie). Truman and Cooper arrive to speak with Packard, who had employed Palmer as an English tutor. Packard admits to sensing that Palmer was troubled but cannot help further; Cooper picks up on the fact that Truman has been having a relationship with Packard. Catherine calls Packard to tell her that the latter's sawmill lost $87,000 the day before; Catherine is having an affair with Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer), with whom she is conspiring a hostile takeover of the mill. That same day, Hayward visits Palmer's mother Sarah (Grace Zabriskie), attempting to console her. However, Sarah has a vision of a sinister man (Frank Silva) crouching in the corner of the room, and panics. Meanwhile, Laurence Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn), Laura's psychiatrist, listens to an audio tape she had made for him, and sobs as he toys with half of a golden heart necklace, the other half of which was found on her body.
Production.
"Episode 1" was written by the series creators David Lynch and Mark Frost. The pair had co-written "Pilot", and would also write "Episode 2" together. Frost would pen a further eight scripts for the series after that, while Lynch would write just one episode—the second season opening installment, "Episode 8". The episode was the first in the series to be directed by Duwayne Dunham, who would return to helm two further installments in the series' second season. The episode features the first appearance of Frank Silva as Killer Bob, though the character is not yet identified at this point. Silva was the art director for the series, and had accidentally been caught on camera during a shot. Lynch was pleased with the result and decided to include Silva in the cast from then on.
Dunham had first met Lynch when he worked as the film editor for Lynch's 1986 film "Blue Velvet". Dunham then edited "Pilot", and was about to look for another editing job elsewhere when he asked Lynch if the director had another film planned; a week later Lynch decided to film "Wild at Heart" and asked Dunham to edit that as well. However, Dunham had committed to another project and felt uncomfortable leaving one editing job for another; Lynch then offered him a directing position on "Twin Peaks" in the interim to justify cancelling his other project. Dunham finished principal photography on "Episode 1" the same day that Lynch finished filming "Wild at Heart".
The introduction of a sexual rapport between the characters of Audrey Horne and Dale Cooper was a suggestion of Dunham's, who felt it would benefit both characters. Dunham felt that the central mystery in the series—the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer—was simply a "MacGuffin" to compel what he saw as the real focus, the interaction of the large ensemble cast. As such, he took care to introduce meaningful interactions between characters wherever possible. Dunham also spent time with each of the cast to help them develop their characters, having studied the scripts involved and basing his take on the characters on his experience with "Pilot".
Dunham retained the frequent use of static cameras seen in "Pilot", something he saw as a hallmark of Lynch's directing style; describing the result as "like framed pictures". He also continued the use of a "warm" reddish tint to the footage, using soft coral filters and carefully selected props and costumes to obtain this coloring. This tint was considered important enough that Lynch sent a representative to the network to ensure they understood it was deliberate and not a mistake, for fear that they might correct the saturation to be more "realistic" before broadcasting it.
Broadcast and reception.
"Episode 1" was first broadcast on American Broadcasting Company (ABC) on April 12, 1990. Upon its initial airing, it was seen by households, or of the available audience. It placed second in its timeslot after "Cheers". This marked a decline from "Pilot", which attracted of the available audience. The following episode would be viewed by of the available audience, representing a further drop in numbers.
Writing for "The A.V. Club", Keith Phipps awarded the episode an "A−" rating. He felt that the scene showing Leo Johnson domestically abusing his wife was "among the show's most disturbing moments", comparing it to a scene from the 1990 film "The Grifters". Phipps also felt the sound design in the episode was impressive, commenting positively on the blurred distinction between diegetic and non-diegetic music. Writing for Allrovi, Andrea LeVasseur rated the episode four stars out of five. Television Without Pity's Daniel J. Blau felt that the episode showed series composer Angelo Badalamenti to have limited range, repeating several similar musical cues throughout. He also considered Eric Da Re's performance as Leo Johnson to be unconvincing, finding it difficult to believe that the character was as feared and menacing as was implied. However, Blau described the introduction of Killer Bob as still seeming powerful and frightening even several years after first being seen, considering it a potent and disturbing scene.

Episode 3 (Twin Peaks)

"Episode 3", later also known as "Rest in Pain", is the fourth episode of the first season of the American mystery television series "Twin Peaks". The episode was written by Harley Peyton, and directed by Tina Rathborne. "Episode 3" features series regulars Kyle MacLachlan, Michael Ontkean and Ray Wise, and introduces Sheryl Lee's second role, Maddy Ferguson.
Rathborne has highlighted the episode's introduction of Jungian analytical psychology to the series. She also described MacLachlan's character Dale Cooper as not only a wholesome, grounded anchor against which the series' more bizarre elements could be contrasted; but as the central component of the series' coming-of-age "Bildungsroman" narrative.
"Episode 3" was first broadcast on April 26, 1990, and was viewed by approximately 18 percent of the available audience in its initial airing. The episode received positive reviews from critics, with its mix of comedy and tragedy seen as a highlight, and Miguel Ferrer's character Albert Rosenfield singled out as a particularly successful example of this. The episode also drew praise from "The New York Times" for its compelling and unusual cast of characters.
Plot.
Background.
The small town of Twin Peaks, Washington, has been shocked by the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) and the attempted murder of her friend Ronette Pulaski (Phoebe Augustine). Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) has come to the town to investigate, and initial suspicion has fallen upon Palmer's boyfriend Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) and the man with whom she was cheating on Briggs, James Hurley (James Marshall). However, other inhabitants of the town have their own suspicions: the violent, drug-dealing truck driver Leo Johnson (Eric Da Re) is seen as a possible suspect. Cooper experiences a surreal dream in which a dwarf and a woman resembling Laura reveal the identity of the killer.
Events.
Cooper and Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) share breakfast, as he realizes she had slipped a note under his hotel room door; the note referred to One-Eyed Jacks, a brothel over the Canadian border. When she leaves, Cooper discusses his dream with Sheriff Harry S. Truman (Michael Ontkean), believing it to be a coded solution to the murder. 
Cooper's colleague, Albert Rosenfield (Miguel Ferrer) wishes to conduct a further post-mortem on Laura's body, but it is due to be released for the funeral that day. As the argument grows more heated, Truman ends it by punching Rosenfield and knocking him down. Later, Rosenfield shares what he has found; Laura had been bound when she was killed, had been addicted to cocaine, and had been clawed by a bird. An unidentified plastic shard was also found in her stomach.
Leland Palmer (Ray Wise) is at home when he is visited by his niece, Madeline Ferguson (Lee). Ferguson is identical to Laura save for having black hair, not blonde. At the same time, Cooper and Truman question Johnson about Laura's death, believing him to be lying when he denies knowing her. Later, Hurley arrives at Laura's funeral late, watching from a distance. Briggs begins to accost the mourners, accusing them of doing nothing when they knew Laura had been troubled. Hurley intervenes and the two begin fighting; Leland falls on the casket as it is being lowered into the grave, sobbing uncontrollably. 
That night, Cooper, Truman, Deputy Hawk (Michael Horse) and Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) meet at the RR Diner. Truman explains that someone has been smuggling cocaine into town; he suspects that Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz), bartender at the town's Roadhouse Bar, is involved. He also explains that the woods around the town seem to contain a "darkness", and that there is a group of men gathered to stand watch against this—the Bookhouse Boys. Truman and the others bring Cooper to their headquarters, where James has Jacques' brother Bernard (Clay Wilcox) bound and gagged. They question Bernard but he denies any crime.
Elsewhere, Jacques realizes his brother is in trouble, and calls Johnson for help. When Johnson leaves, his abused wife Shelley (Mädchen Amick) hides a gun in a secret drawer. Meanwhile, sawmill owner Josie Packard (Joan Chen) tells Truman, her lover, that her sister-in-law Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) is scheming to take over the mill. Packard knows there are two account books, one fake and one real, but cannot locate the real one Martell has been hiding.
Production.
"Episode 3" was the first of the series to be written by Harley Peyton; Peyton returned to pen a number of other episodes across both seasons. The episode was directed by Tina Rathborne, who would also go on to helm "Episode 17" in the second season. Rathborne had previously worked with series co-creator David Lynch when she had cast him in her 1988 feature film "Zelly and Me".
The episode introduces the character of Maddy Ferguson, the second role played by Lee after Ferguson's cousin Laura. Lee had been a stage actor living in Washington, where "Pilot" was filmed, and had remained there after production moved to Los Angeles as she believed that, with her character dead, she would have no further part in the series. However, Lynch was impressed with her performance and called to ask her to return, telling her he would "figure [...] out" a way for her to continue appearing.
Rathborne chose to open the episode with a shot centred on Sherilyn Fenn, finding the actress to be "seductive" and "absorbing" in a similar manner to screen icon Marilyn Monroe. Rathborne had initially worried that the episode featured too many static scenes of characters sitting and talking, with little action, and asked Lynch if she could borrow some of the imagery of the previous episode's surreal dream sequence to keep these conversations more interesting, adding brief snippets of footage as Cooper discussed the dream with the others. Rathborne has noted that this dream-centric approach to the character of Cooper is rooted in Carl Jung's theories of analytical psychology. She felt this was something that had not been seen on television before, and credits Lynch with introducing it to the series. She has also described the narrative, both of "Episode 3" and of "Twin Peaks" as a whole, as a "Bildungsroman" showing Cooper's development into a more rounded and enlightened person.
Working on studio sets was a new experience for Rathborne, whose previous work had all been filmed on location. She also found it refreshing to work with the series' ensemble cast, recalling that Miguel Ferrer often had the cast and crew laughing at the way he approached his material, imbuing the atmosphere during filming with a mix of comedy and drama. Rathborne has also noted the use of ordinary, almost banal, daily life in the series, finding it a necessary element to be able to play the series' more violent and surreal elements against effectively. She particularly singled out Cooper as a wholesome "boy next door" character who allowed the town's more unusual residents to stand out more starkly.
Broadcast and reception.
"Episode 3" was first broadcast by the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) on April 19, 1990. In its initial airing, it was viewed by of US households, representing of the available audience. This marked a slight decline from the previous episode, which had attracted of the population and of the available audience.
"The A.V. Club" Keith Phipps rated the episode a B+, finding that it struggled to live up to the preceding episode; however, he felt that this was understandable, as "after pushing television to the limits of sanity there was nowhere to go but back". Phipps also described the funeral scene as a highlight of the episode, finding that he grew to appreciate its mix of tragic and comic more over repeated viewings. Writing for Allrovi, Andrea LeVasseur rated the episode four stars out of five. 
John J. O'Connor, writing for "The New York Times" praised the episode, stating that it features "the most bizarrely compelling collection of characters ever to hit prime time". O'Connor spoke positively of the intricate plot seen in the episode and the series as a whole, noting that "the overall narrative is paramount" and affirming his belief that the series "seems to have been mapped out carefully" by Lynch and Frost. Television Without Pity's Daniel J. Blau praised the episode's black humour, singling out in particular the scene in which Ferrer's character is punched after an argument in the town morgue. However, Blau was critical of guest stars Olkewicz and Wilcox, finding their attempted French-Canadian accents particularly poor. Writing for Digital Spy, Tony Delgado has also praised Ferrer's role as Rosenfield, adding that his dialogue "may not appear to be the epitome of wit, but the way delivered such lines caused plenty of howling hysterics in living rooms across the globe".

The Black Monk of Pontefract

The Black Monk of Pontefract (also referred to as The Pontefract Poltergeist) is an alleged poltergeist haunting that occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the home of Joe and Jean Pritchard on 30 East Drive Chequerfield Estate in Pontefract.
Claims.
Disturbances allegedly began after the Pritchard family moved into their home in the town of Pontefract. Sarah Scholes said she felt a cold gust of wind. Phillip Scholes says he saw white powder falling from mid-air in the living room floor. According to paranormal book author Colin Wilson, puddles of water began appearing on the kitchen floor and a plumber could not offer an explanation. Wilson writes that Mrs. Scholes and her son Phillip left the home to sleep at a neighbour's out of fear when a heavy chest of drawers reportedly began swaying. According to Wilson, the disturbances stopped for two years, but began again. The family claimed to hear loud crashing sounds and see objects moving or dematerializing. 
Wilson writes that Pritchard's daughter Diane was often thrown from her bed and once dragged up the stairs by "an invisible hand that left lacerations on her neck." There were also claims that after holy water was sprinkled throughout the home, the poltergeist "responded" by painting upside-down crosses on the living room walls and doors and destroying crucifixes. Joe and Jean Pritchard claimed that a black-cloaked figure with a cowl over its head appeared over their bed. 
Paranormal investigators.
Paranormal investigator Tom Cuniff visited the Pritchard home after the alleged disturbances ceased and speculated that the ghost of a Cluniac monk who lived during Henry VIII's reign and was hanged for the rape and murder of a young girl had haunted the Pritchards. 
Paranormal book author Colin Wilson proposed that poltergeists find their energy in unhappy households and that tensions between Phillip and Mr. Pritchard made the home susceptible. The area surrounding the Chequerfield Estate, according to Wilson, favoured "manifestations" because they retained "particular spiritual force" from their religious histories. 
Pontefract Castle.
Pontefract Castle near the Chequerfield Estate is a popular tourist destination, both because of its rich history (King Richard II is thought to have been murdered there), and because of the reported sightings of a black monk walking from the kitchen to the Queen's Tower.

Anas Al-Sheghri (; born 1988) was a leading activist in the peaceful protests in the beginning of the Syrian uprising (2011–present).
Life and Activism.
Anas Ali Al-Shegri was born in the village of al-Baydha near the city of Banyas. He was in his third year as a student at the School of Economics at Latakia Tishreen University, when the Syrian Uprising against the regime of Bashar al-Assad erupted in March 2011.
According to his biography at Free Syrian Translators website, Anas played a leading role in stimulating the protests that called for democracy and for the toppling of al-Assad's regime in the city of Banyas, which is considered the second city to rebel in Syria after Daraa.
Anas had also played an important role in the media coverage of the uprising. He was one of the first Syrian activists inside the country to speak to the Media using his real name. It is also important to mention that Banyas was the first city to broadcast its demonstrations live to the news media.
Anas was arrested on May 14, 2011 when the Syrian army and the security forces along with the Shabbiha stormed the city of Banyas. Dunia TV (which is very close to the Syrian Regime) announced that the reason behind Anas' arrest is his alleged involvement in an attempt to establish an Islamic State and his appointment as the "Minister of Interior" in this alleged state.
The fate of Anas and his whereabouts are not yet known. It is not affirmed whether he has died at some detention center that belongs to one of the various Intelligence agencies in Syria or he is still alive. What is certain, though, is that he became one of the icons of the Syrian revolution against Bashar al-Assad.

Spinor genus

In mathematics, the spinor genus is a classification of quadratic forms and lattices over the ring of integers, introduced by Martin Eichler. It refines the genus but may be coarser than proper equivalence
We define two Z-lattices "L" and "M" in a quadratic space "V" over Q to be spinor equivalent if there exists a transformation "g" in the proper orthogonal group "O"+("V") and for every prime "p" there exists a local transformation "f""p" of "V""p" of spinor norm 1 such that "M" = "g" "f""p""L""p".
A "spinor genus" is an equivalence class for this equivalence relation. Properly equivalent lattices are in the same spinor genus, and lattices in the same spinor genus are in the same genus. The number of spinor genera in a genus is a power of two, and can be determined effectively.
An important result is that for indefinite forms of dimension at least three, each spinor genus contains exactly one proper equivalence class.

Giving it 3 stars out of 5, Bobby Peacock of Roughstock praised the "uncluttered, often soft production" and Lynch's voice, but thought that the latter half of the album contained too many songs about partying. An identical rating came from Billy Dukes of Taste of Country, who said that "His more pensive, thought-provoking lyrics stand out above the party songs."

Portland Rosebuds (ice hockey)

Portland Rosebuds was the name of two professional men's ice hockey teams in Portland, Oregon. Both teams played their home games at the Portland Ice Arena.
1914–1918 Portland Rosebuds.
The first Portland Rosebuds played in the Pacific Coast Hockey Association from 1914 to 1918. The team was previously known as the New Westminster Royals, an inaugural member of the PCHA in 1911. The team moved to Portland due to poor attendance in New Westminster, British Columbia, and the availability of a larger arena in Portland. In 1916 the Portland Rosebuds won the PCHA championship and briefly held the Stanley Cup, losing it to the Montreal Canadiens in the 1916 Stanley Cup Final. Their win is memorialized on the Stanley Cup as "Portland Ore./PCHA Champions/1915–16" on the 1909 base ring, one of the permanent rings. Portland was the first United States-based team to participate in the Stanley Cup Finals.
1925–1926 Portland Rosebuds.
The second Rosebuds team was born when the Regina Capitals moved to Portland for the 1925–26 WHL season. This was the final season for the Western Hockey League (WHL).
When the league folded, the Saskatoon players were sold to form the Montreal Maroons. Frank Patrick then negotiated the sale of the rest of the WHL players to the National Hockey League. The players were to be sold as three teams, one from the Victoria Cougars, one from the Rosebuds, and a third from the best players from Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver. A deal was reached where the players of the Rosebuds were sold for $100,000 to form the new Chicago Black Hawks expansion franchise.

CEB (Continuing Education of the Bar)

CEB (Continuing Education of the Bar • California) is a self-supporting program of the University of California that is co-sponsored by the California State Bar. Founded in 1947, CEB modernized continuing legal education (CLE) by providing three, six, and 24 hour courses in locations that were convenient to California practitioners. CEB fulfills its mandate to cultivate the professional development of California lawyers by offering CLE courses, and by publishing practice guides.
CEB has received multiple awards from the Association for Continuing Legal Education (ACLEA), including the Award of Professional Excellence for Publications in 2012, 2011, 2006, 2005, 2002, and 1996. In addition, in 2012 CEB was ranked as the best CLE provider in California by the readers of "The Recorder" legal newspaper, and the third-best law-book publisher.
Objectives of the program.
As set forth in the Memorandum of Understanding for the Joint Sponsorship of the Continuing Education of the Bar Program between the State Bar of California and the Regents of the University of California, CEB's objectives are to:
CEB's goal is to collaborate with members of the legal profession to "deliver the best current knowledge for the proficient and successful practice of law, thereby contributing to the betterment of the members of the legal profession, the public and the administration of justice."
Governing committee.
Oversight of CEB is provided by the CEB Governing Committee. The Committee consists of nine voting members: four members appointed by the State Bar of California and five members appointed by the University of California. The University appoints the chair, and the State Bar's Board of Governors appoints the vice chair. The vice chair must be a lawyer in active practice in California. The other members the State Bar appoints include the Executive Director of the State Bar, or the Executive Director's designee who must be a lawyer, and two members who are actively practicing law in California, at least one of whom represents the interests of the sections of the State Bar. The Committee reviews and approves CEB's annual publishing and educational program, strategic objectives, annual budget, and recommendations from the Director on the overall operation of CEB.
CLE courses.
CEB's CLE courses are typically presented by practicing attorneys and judges with expertise in the course's subject matter. All CEB courses are also available through CEB's "On Demand" service. In June 2012, CEB began offering podcasts on recent developments, beginning with two podcasts on the decision in Brinker Restaurant Corp. v Superior Court (Hohnbaum) (2012) 53 C4th 1004.
CLE courses cover substantive practice areas including business law, criminal law, employment law, estate planning, real property law, family law, and litigation. CEB also offers law practice management programs, including "Making Sure You Get Paid: Accounts Receivable Management" which is available online to members of the Bar free of charge. CEB also tackles subjects required by the California State Bar's minimum Continuing Legal Education Program, including legal ethics, elimination of bias, and substance abuse.
Each year CEB and the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law present a 12-hour Estate Planning Institute in Los Angeles. The program focuses on advanced estate planning and estate tax issues. Speakers in 2012 included Dr. Richard Saller. Dr. Saller is Dean of the Stanford University School of Humanities and Sciences and Professor of Classics and History. Each January, CEB presents a two-day fair in several locations across California that focuses on recent developments in the areas of estate planning, real property, business law, civil litagtion and torts, and ethics.
In 2012, CEB was voted the number one continuing legal education provider in California by readers of The Recorder.
Publications.
CEB publishes more than 120 practice guides—most of which are updated every year—in substantive areas including business law; civil litigation and torts; criminal law; employment law & workers' compensation; estate planning, trust and probate; family law; public law; and real property. CEB also publishes books on law practice management topics, such as the "California Client Communications Manual: Sample Letters and Forms" (Cal CEB 2012). The Association for Continuing Legal Education (ACLEA) has recognized the excellence of CEB's practice guides, including "Criminal Sentencing Enhancements" (Cal CEB 2012) and "California Wage and Hour: Law and Litigation" (Cal CEB 2010) by awarding the Awards of Professional Excellence and of Outstanding Achievement to CEB practice guides.
CEB also publishes more than 25 "Action Guides," which are short, softbound books that describe step-by-step how to handle a specific task for a client. Action Guides are updated every two years. Topics include "Creating Your Discovery Plan," "Handling Postmortem Trust Administration: A Checklist," "Handling a Real Property Foreclosure," and "Handling a Wrongful Termination Action."
CEB publishes four periodicals: the quarterly "California Business Law Practitioner," as well as the "California Business Law Reporter," the "Estate Planning and California Probate Reporter," and the "Real Property Law Reporter," which are published every two months. The publications are designed to keep the practitioner up to date concerning developments in his or her practice area.
In conjunction with the California Center for Judicial Education and Research (CJER), CEB publishes a number of criminal law handbooks and benchbooks, including the Felony Sentencing Handbook and the Mandatory Criminal Jury Instructions Handbook.
CEB's practice guides and Action Guides are available online through OnLAW. OnLAW allows the user to search a book or a library of books for specific words, to answer legal questions and locate forms. Books published on OnLAW are embedded with links to U.S. Supreme Court cases, as well as California cases and codes.
Blog and social media.
CEB offers free content to practicing attorneys and members of the public on its blog, law alerts, and discussion forums. The American Bar Association acknowledged CEB's blog as one of the top 100 law blogs in 2011.
CEB publishes blog posts three times a week on substantive topics including business law, civil litigation, constitutional law, criminal law, elder law, employment law, estate planning, evidence, family law, public law, real property, and tort law. The blog also covers legal writing, litigation strategy, new legal developments, the practice of law, and profiles of California attorneys.
CEB shares its blog posts and other information of interest to practicing attorneys on Facebook, LinkedIn, Google Plus, and Twitter.
Spirit of CEB Awards.
Throughout the years, the key to the success of CEB's programs and publications has been the generosity of the attorneys and judges who have volunteered to speak and write for CEB. These individuals—motivated not by hopes of personal gain but by their love of teaching and dedication to improving the profession—have made an enduring contribution to the continuing education of attorneys through their work over the years. To acknowledge these contributors and their service to the legal profession, CEB initiated the "Spirit of CEB" Awards in 2005. These awards are an acknowledgement of the selfless sharing of information by these colleagues for the betterment of the legal profession and the society it serves.
In 2012, CEB honored the following volunteer authors and speakers:
CEB legal research and writing award.
Since 2008, CEB has recognized the achievement of first-year law students with Awards for Excellence in Legal Research and Writing at several UC law schools. The award is granted to the top student in the school's first-year research and writing program. The award includes a certificate and a $2,500 cash prize. Winners include:
From the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law
From the University of California, Davis, School of Law
From the University of California, Irvine, School of Law
AccessLaw.

Armand Sabal-Lecco

Armand Sabal-Lecco is a bass-guitarist from Cameroon who has played with many leading jazz players, and recorded on many albums, since getting his break playing with Paul Simon in 1989. He is one of the world's leading session artists.
He is the brother of the drummer Félix Sabal Lecco.
Early years.
Armand Sabal-Lecco was born in Cameroon.
Armand Sabal-Lecco's father, Félix Sabal Lecco, was a minister in the government of Ahmadou Ahidjo, and was later appointed ambassador to Italy and France.
His father played the guitar as a young man, and two of his brothers are also musicians: Félix is a drummer and Roger is a bass player. Armand began playing the guitar when he was six, then took up drumming, and eventually settled on the bass, although he is not limited to that instrument.
According to Armand, his older brother Roger would often be late for rehearsals and shows, and Armand began standing in for him as bass player.
He decided the bass was more convenient than drums, easier to pack up, so he had more chance of picking up girls before they left after the show.
When he was fifteen, his father sent him to Paris to live with one of his sisters.
Career.
In Cameroon, Armand Sabal-Lecco had played funk, rock and straight-ahead jazz. 
It was only after moving to Europe that he started introducing African elements to his music.
In the early 1980s he co-founded the "Ogogoro Gang", an Afro Funk band, and began playing clubs on Europe.
After a year the group was voted the number one ""Jeune espoir francais"".
He also developed his skills as a composer during this period.
Armand and his brother Félix formed the African fusion band "Xamahal", performing together at the 1986 European Jazz Festival.
Later he joined the "Manu Dibango Band", led by Cameroonian saxophone and vibraphone player Manu Dibango.
He toured with this band around the world and played on several of their albums.
In 1989 Armand Sabal-Lecco was invited to New York by Paul Simon to play bass on Simon's eighth studio album album, "The Rhythm of the Saints", released in 1990.
His brother, Félix, plays drums on this album.
This was followed by a 14-month world tour.
On 15 August 1991 he performed with Paul Simon to an audience of over 750,000 people in New York's Central Park.
In 1993 he was invited to Washington D.C. to play with Paul Simon at President Bill Clinton's inauguration festivities.
Sabal-Lecco played on Stanley Clarke's 1993 album "East River Drive", and often played with Clarke in the years that followed.
He became an official member of the Stanley Clarke band in 2002. 
In 2004 he played at the Bahamas Jazz Festival as a member of this band. 
A sample of other artists with whom he has played includes Vanessa Williams, Maxi Priest, the Brecker Brothers, Herbie Hancock, Manu Dibango, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Jonathan Butler, Sting and Ray Charles. 
He is also known for composing, singing, arranging and producing.
He composed two songs and co-authored the cover song for John Patitucci's 1993 "Another World", later nominated for a Grammy Award.
As a composer he has written for Carole King, Jeff Beck, Robin Thicke, Stewart Copeland, John Patitucci and Don Grusin.
His album "Positive Army", which also features his brother Felix, was due to be released in June 2012. He plays a range of instruments on this album.

Southwest Rail Corridor

The Southwest Rail Corridor is a proposed commuter rail line serving southwestern Houston. The line connects Missouri City to METRORail's current Fannin South. It then merges with METRORail's Red line and ends at the Museum District.
History.
As the population in both Harris County and Fort Bend County grew, more commuters started to go to central Houston. The area with most commuters from Fort Bend County is the Texas Medical Center with 24,000 daily trips. This is where 33% of the trips are headed to. The number of commuters is expected to reach 32,000 by 2035.
Rolling Stock.
While it is still on debate to use light rail, electric locomotive, or diesel locomotive as the trains, recent articles have shown that light rail will likely be the fleet used.
