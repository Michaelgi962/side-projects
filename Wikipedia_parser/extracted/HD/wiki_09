State Palaces, Castles and Gardens of Saxony

The State Palaces, Castles and Gardens of Saxony () is a state-owned company with its head office in Dresden. It belongs to the Saxon State Ministry of Finance and has the aim of preserving Saxon cultural heritage whilst respecting cultural and conservation needs. The state-owned company manages several palaces, castles and parks in the Saxony. These include the Zwinger in Dresden, the Albrechtsburg in Meissen and Kriebstein Castle.
History.
Following the restoration of the Free State of Saxony on 3 October 1990, assets that had already been owned in the past by the state, or which had been managed during the East German era as legal entities under the Asset Allocation Act, were transferred into the ownership of the new German state.
So, on 1 January 1992, the state took over the following properties: Dresden Castle including the Johanneum and the Stallhof, the Dresden Zwinger and the Zwinger Gardens, the Japanese Palace with its palace garden, Pillnitz Castle and park, Moritzburg Palace and the surrounding landscape gardens, the Albrechtsburg in Meißen, Königstein Fortress, Weesenstein Palace and park, Gnandstein Castle, Frauenstein castle ruins, Großsedlitz Baroque Gardens, Hubertusburg Palace, Nischwitz Palace, Stolpen Castle, Augustusburg Palace, Lichtenwalde Palace, the palace and park at Bad Muskau, Colditz Castle, Altzella Abbey, Nossen Palace, Wiederau Palace, Mildenstein Castle and the Ortenburg
In the following years, other historic buildings were allocated to the Free State of Saxony.
With a cabinet decision on 3 November 1992, 17 independent state companies were formed for some of the most important sites and placed under commercial management. These companies together formed the State Palaces Department ("Staatliche Schlösserverwaltung"). During the implementation phase, between 1 April 1993 and 1 January 1994, 15 state-owned enterprises were founded for the following properties:
In addition, the Palaces Department managed the following properties directly: the Albertinum, the Catholic Court Church, the Jägerhof, the Royal Burial Chapel at Freiberg, Colditz Castle, Lichtenwalde Palace and the Exhibition Hall of the Academy of Art.
"Schlösserland Sachsen".
In 2005, the advertising association "Schlösserland Sachsen" (Castles of Saxony) was created, a federation of major governmental and non-governmental heritage building and gardens groups, which has the task of preserviing, maintaining and displaying Saxony's cultural monuments. Under this umbrella brand, in cooperation with the Saxony Tourism Marketing Corporation (TMGS), more than 50 castles, palaces, gardens, fortresses and castle hotels are marketed both nationwide and internationally.
The following palaces, castles and abbeys are partners in the "Werbegemeinschaft Schlösserland Sachsen":
In addition there are the properties owned by the hotel and hospitality industry: Hohnstein Castle, "Churfuerstliche Waldschänke Moritzburg, Europa-Jugendherberge Schloss Colditz, Pension Zur Königlichen Ausspanne, Schloss Hotel Dresden-Pillnitz" and "Schlosshotel Gaußig".
Visitor numbers.
The state-owned palaces, castles and gardens receive about two million visitors every year.
Management and staff.
The head office of the state company has five divisions under the management of Christian Striefler. The individual palace business units are run by a palace manager ("Schlossleiter").
The supervisory body for the state firm is the governing board ("Verwaltungsrat"). Its main task is the oversight of the business leadership and support to the manager.

Production.
Composition and theme.
“No Mercy” is composed and produced by Marco and Jeon Daun of TS Entertainment. B.A.P member Yong Guk helped with the lyrics.

The song was released digitally as the lead single of the album No Mercy (EP) on July 19, 2012.
Music video.
The 48 seconds teaser clip for the music video of the song was released on July 17, 2012 while the full version was released a day later. It was directed by Hong Won-ki of Johnny Bros., who is famously known for directing music videos for Seo Taeji, Super Junior, Girls' Generation, Secret, Beast as well as their own previous works. The video was also released through YouTube.

Amarin Corporation

Amarin Corporation is a biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Bedminster, New Jersey. The company develops and markets medicines for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Amarin develops the drug Vascepa (AMR-101) which is a prescription grade omega-3 fatty acid. In December 2007, the company acquired Ester Neurosciences Limited for 8.1 million USD. Amarin CEO Joe Zakrzewski has said that the company would like to first work on building its infrastructure out to commercialize the drug in the United States.
Recently on July 26, 2012, their lead-candidate drug named Vascepa (AMR-101) received FDA-approval. Vascepa will also be a key competitor against GlaxoSmithKline's Lovaza.
Products and development.
Amarin's only product is Vascepa, which is an approved prescription grade Omega-3 fatty acid drug that helps with the treatment for cardiovascular disease. Vascepa's clinical-data trials were the MARINE and ANCHOR studies. UPDATE: FDA panel voted against (9-2) recommending an expanded drug label of Vacepa (10/16/13). Shares dropped over 60%
In November 2010, Amarin's MARINE study which was to treat patients with very high triglycerides (>500 mg/dL). Vascepa showed a decrease in triglycerides. Unlike Vascepa's competitor Lovaza, Vascepa did not have a significant increase in median LDL-C unlike Lovaza which can raise it from 40% to 50%.
In April 2011, Amarin's ANCHOR study which was to treat patients with high triglycerides (200 mg/dL to less than 500 mg/dL). Vascepa also displayed a decrease LDL-C. Another unique detail about the ANCHOR study is that Vascepa was able to get approved for the patient population of 200 mg/dL to less than 500 mg/dL, unlike Lovaza which was not approved for this patient population.
These studies displayed that Vascepa reduced triglyceride levels and other important lipid and inflammation biomarkers, including Apo-B, non-HDL-C, Total-Cholesterol, VLDL-C, Lp-PLA2, and hs-CRP.

It is an accepted medical sign of a midbrain lesion, first described in 1927 by J Collier. With the eyes in the primary position, the sclera can be seen above the cornea, and further upgaze increases the distance between the eyelids and irises. Causes include upper dorsal midbrain supranuclear lesions such as Parinaud's syndrome, 'top of the basilar syndrome', midbrain infarction, neurodegeneration or tumour, Multiple Sclerosis, encephalitis, and Miller-Fisher Syndrome. The aetiology is thought to be damage to the posterior commissure levator inhibitory fibres which originate in the M-group of neurons.

Plot.
Penelope notices a luxurious cruise liner and wishes to go aboard, but the ticket collector will not permit her and tosses her away when she kisses his nose. As the cruiser begins to sail away, Penelope squeezes under a painted white fence, getting a white stripe across her spine. Penelope makes a running jump, catches one of the overhanging ropes and climbs aboard the ship. Meanwhile on the coast, Pepe le Pew is taking a walk, singing and notices the cruiser. When he takes a closer look through binoculars he spots Penelope. Thinking she is a female skunk, the lovestruck Pepe runs across the seabed.
As Penelope emerges on the cruiser, the entire crew and passengers evacuate the ship, spelling "LE PEW!" in the water. Pepe then emerges on the cruiser dripping wet and finds Penelope. First he asks her for a date, but then immediately leaps on her and smooches her. Penelope wriggles free and runs off. Pepe heads to Beauty Salon and dries himself with a hair dryer puffing his fur up, but then he brushes himself. Pepe then rushes to Penelope and smooches her again and she wriggles and rushes off. Pepe chases Penelope wherever she goes until Penelope escapes on the lifeboat. But as Penelope watches the cruiser drift away, Pepe emerges and Penelope has nowhere left to run.

Washington Women's History Consortium

The Washington Women's History Consortium is a nonprofit organization that works to document, preserve, and disseminate historical information about the contributions and achievements of women within the state of Washington. The organization was established in 2005 by the state legislature and is managed by the Washington State Historical Society, supported by an advisory board that is appointed by the state governor and legislature. The Consortium is located at the Washington State Capital Museum and Outreach Center in Olympia. 
Organizational background.
The Washington Women's History Consortium was established in 2005, by the Washington State Legislation (RCW 27.34.360). The initial goal of the Consortium was to collect historical documentation about the contributions and achievements that Washington women have made, in preparation for a 2010 celebration honoring the Centennial of Women's Suffrage in the state. The centennial celebration was held on November 8, 2010 and was known statewide as the "Day of Jubilation". The celebration included music and theatrical performances, speeches, and a court re-enactment.
In 2006, the Consortium created a comprehensive Web site that provides access to digital images and documents that have been contributed by legislatively mandated partners throughout the state. These partners receive financial support from the Consortium to collaborate and assist in the collection and preservation of historical information that is used in the online Women's History Consortium Collection. Associate partners are currently digitizing collections of historical materials for their organizations, using the Consortium's proprietary software.
, statewide legislatively mandated partners include the Washington State Library and Archives (operated by the Secretary of State), Western Washington University, the University of Washington, the Evergreen State College, Central Washington University, Eastern Washington University, Washington State University, and the Northwest Museum of Arts & Culture in Spokane. Associate partners include the Everett Public Library and the Yakima Valley Museum.
The Women's History Consortium Collection serves as a centralized digital database of resources that pertain to the research and study of women's history in Washington state. The collection improves the availability of historical information about women's contributions and achievements, primarily focusing on the latter half of the 20th century. Areas of study include the history of women in the military, politics, suffrage, education, entertainment, fashion, and sports. Accessible resources include biographies, oral histories, newspaper archives, organizations, timelines, digital publications, museum exhibits, photographs, and personal papers. 
Membership.
Membership in the Washington Women's History Consortium is mandated by law to ensure a representative of citizens from throughout the state. The organization is managed by the Washington State Historical Society, supported by a board of advisors consisting of 15 members including private citizens, business, labor, historical societies, educational institutions, tribes, and public officials. 
The governor is responsible to appoint 11 members to the board of advisors, representing a cross-section of individuals from throughout the state to ensure a diverse membership based on geographic location, demographics, and subject-matter expertise. Two members are chosen by the President of the Senate from among the Washington State Senate, each representing the two largest caucuses. The Speaker of the House of Representatives is responsible to appoint the final two members, each representing the two largest caucuses of the house of representatives.

Francis Lane Fox

Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Gordon Ward ('Joe') Lane Fox (formerly Jackson), (14 October 1899 – 31 July 1989) was a British Army officer and prominent Yorkshire landowner.
Early life.
Francis Lane Fox was the son of Claude Ward Jackson (1869–1937) and Una Whiting (née Wilcox). He was educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was commissioned into the Royal Horse Guards on 16 July 1919.
After service as a young officer of the Household Cavalry, 'Joe' Ward-Jackson (as he was then known) was appointed aide-de-camp to the Viceroy of India, Lord Irwin, in 1928. He met Lord Irwin's niece, Marcia Agnes Mary Lane Fox (1904–1980), eldest daughter and heiress of Lt-Col George Lane Fox (soon to be created Lord Bingley) when she visited India. They were married on 3 October 1929 and In 1937 Jackson changed his surname by deed poll to Lane Fox. In 1947 he was granted the Royal licence to bear the coat of arms of Fox.
War service.
Lane Fox was promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 26 June 1941, and took command of the Household Cavalry Training Regiment. On 20 September 1943 he assumed command of 43rd (Wessex) Reconnaissance Regiment (43 Recce) in 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, which was training for the Normandy Landings.
The wreck of the "Derrycunihy".
Soon after D-Day, 43 Recce embarked on a transport named the , which arrived off Sword Beach on the evening of 20 June. High seas and enemy shelling prevented unloading for three days and it was decided to move to Juno Beach for disembarkation. As the ship started engines on the morning of 24 June it detonated a mine dropped by a Luftwaffe raider. The mine explosion split the ship in two, and the after part, packed with soldiers, sank rapidly. Worse still, an ammunition lorry caught fire, and oil floating on the water was set alight. Landing craft and gunboats quickly came alongside and picked up survivors. The Regimental War Diary records that 'Great gallantry was displayed by all troops in the two aft holds'. Over 180 men of the regiment and 25 ships' crew and gunners were lost, and about 120 wounded of 43 Recce were evacuated. The disaster represented the biggest single loss of life off the invasion beaches.
When all the survivors had been taken off, Lane Fox and the Captain of the "Derrycunihy" argued over who should be last to leave the half-sunken ship.
Mont Pinçon.
Once 43 Recce had been reinforced and reorganised, it took its place in the fighting line, seeing its first action on 4 August, following up the retreating Germans and gaining vital information for 43 Wessex Division's attack on Mont Pinçon. The divisional historian praises the Recce regiment for its boldness in this action. 43rd Wessex took Mont Pinçon after bitter fighting and on 10 August 43 Recce advanced boldly again, seizing bridges and slipping between pockets of German resistance.
'Hell's Highway'.
Following the German defeat in Normandy, the Allies advanced rapidly, until they came to the canals and rivers of the Netherlands. A bold plan (Operation Market Garden) was conceived whereby airborne troops seized bridges to allow fast-moving ground forces to 'bounce' the river crossings up to and including the Rhine at Arnhem. The parachute and glider drop went in on 17 September and the ground advance was led by the Guards Armoured Division, with 43rd Wessex given the vital task of following up and keeping the precarious single road open behind them. The plan failed: the British 1st Airborne Division was only able to reach the North end of Arnhem Bridge, and eventually were driven away. When 43rd Wessex arrived, it was too late. All they could do was make a desperate attempt to cross the Rhine by boat, and when that failed to assist the evacuation of the survivors of 1st Airborne during the night of 25 September 1944.
43rd (Wessex) Division was blamed by many airborne soldiers for its dilatory advance, though the Corps commander, Lt-Gen Brian Horrocks, defended the division, pointing out that it could not deploy any armoured vehicles (like 43 Recce's armoured cars and half-tracks) off the single road, nicknamed 'Hell's Highway', which was cut behind them on several occasions. Nevertheless, Lane Fox was immediately replaced as CO of 43 Recce (1 October 1944). The divisional history describes Lane Fox's departure as 'a sad loss to the Regiment. Throughout the Normandy battle his constant presence with the forward troops his traditional high standards of honour and his indifference to personal danger had endeared him to all ranks'.
In 1945 Lane Fox was appointed to command the Yorkshire Hussars, of which his father-in-law Lord Bingley was Honorary Colonel. He retired from the army in 1946.
Family.
After the death of Lord Bingley in 1947, Francis and the Hon Marcia Lane Fox took over the running of the Bramham Park estate. They had three children:

CustomMade

CustomMade is an online marketplace that connects customers with independent artisans (called "custom makers") who produce custom-designed furniture, jewelry, home décor, and other personalized items. CustomMade is the world’s first and largest online seller of custom products. They have 3,500 custom makers registered on the site and have raised a total of $7.65 million in venture funding.
Company history.
Beginnings.
Co-founders Michael Salguero and Seth Rosen met as undergraduates at Boston University, where both had a passion for custom-made shirts, belts, and pants. The two founders had careers in real estate and were looking for more exciting work. In January 2009, Salguero and Rosen bought the custommade.com URL for $150,000 from a woodworker who had owned and run the site since 1996. At the time of the purchase, the site hosted around 350 makers paying a small subscription fee to be on the site. The site was generating about $35,000 a year in subscription sales. According to Salguero, the new company became based on two principles:
"1. Custom becomes an obsession. As a shopper, once you’re empowered to get something exactly the way you want it, you will realize you can get ANYTHING made exactly the way you want it. And CustomMade thinks you should be able to. Easily. 
2. There is some talented individual maker or some company out there who can make you exactly what you’re looking for, exactly the way you want it. All you need is a way to communicate with that maker."
Growth.
The founders spent much of the first year rebuilding the site’s interface and visiting woodworking and craft fairs to sign up custom makers with the site. In January 2009, they raised a $400,000 seed round. Early versions of CustomMade.com drew visitors, but only a small number of those visitors ordered items. CustomMade redesigned the site with help from Google Ventures and within a week, increased the number of paying projects by 200 percent. From 2009 to 2010, the number of visitors to the site tripled to a total of 1.5 million, and in 2010, CustomMade earned $350,000 in revenue.
In November 2011, CustomMade raised $2.1 million in Series A funding from First Round Capital, Google Ventures, and others. With the additional investment, CustomMade planned to expand its Lechmere Square headquarters by 5,000 square feet and its number of employees from 27 to over 50. At the time of the announcement, CustomMade had produced over $2 million in project requests.
In April 2012, CustomMade closed a $4 million funding round led by Google Ventures with additional investments from Schooner Capital, LaunchCapital, NextView Ventures, Andrew McCollum, and First Round Capital. CustomMade currently has over 3,500 custom makers on the site. As of April 2012, CustomMade has 3 million visitors a year and handles $2 million a month in transactions.
Site structure.
Customers can browse listings and galleries based on criteria like function of the item, proximity of the custom maker, or build materials. They can search by category, such as "wine-room design" or "custom tile mosaics," or by location, which gives the names of local custom makers. Potential customers can also post a proposed item to the site’s Job Board and custom makers will bid for the chance to build it. Through the Job Board, customers can provide guidelines like time flexibility, price range, and a basic idea of the desired item. Users can also browse and choose from already-made furniture, jewelry, glass, and metal objects. CustomMade builders are also available to build entire homes.
CustomMade also has a commercial gallery with work examples. The galleries show examples such as restaurant and office build-outs, conference tables, wine cellars, liturgical furnishings, gun cabinets, musical instruments, clocks, walking sticks, engagement rings, mirrors, frames, boats, and vases. Specifically, custom maker Kyle Buckner produced an "iTable," which has touch-screen functions like an iPhone but is built with scratch-resistant coatings making it a functional table. Another Massachusetts customer commissioned the production of a "lobster tickler," a device for catching crustaceans.
Business model.
CustomMade takes a commission on each sale, and all of the custom makers featured on the site are fully vetted before they can post their work. Unlike Etsy, which focuses on handmade products, CustomMade connects customers with makers who can build to the buyer’s specifications. Craftsmen who want to be featured on CustomMade pay monthly fees and upload examples of their work. The average CustomMade product sells for about $1,500.
Reception.
CustomMade was featured in CBS’s list of the best Mother’s Day gifts for 2011. Rich Miner, a partner at Google Ventures, said that CustomMade has "a huge runway to expand into a mass-market product."
The site had approximately 3 million visitors in 2011. The company’s transaction volume is currently growing at approximately 50% each month and about $500,000 worth of projects are requested each week. A Maine-based woodworker said that his CustomMade subscription has "one thousand times paid for itself. I have work lined up until after Christmas." CustomMade has been featured in CNN, Fox News, "Fast Company", TechCrunch, and "The Wall Street Journal".

<doc id="36552959" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36552959" title="Woody Pop">
Woody Pop

, is a ball and paddle game similar to the likes of "Breakout" and "Arkanoid" It was originally released exclusively in Japan for the Sega Master System in 1987, before being given an international release on the Sega Game Gear in 1991. The Master System version of the game is designed to be used with the Paddle Control, and will not function correctly with any other controller. It would be the last game released in Japan with the Mark III branding and on a My Card.
Gameplay.
Players control a cartoon rendition of a tree spirit in the form of a log named Woody. His mission is to use a ball to break down block barriers set up by an enemy known as The Mad Machine inside the Mansion Toy Factory. The barriers consist of normal blocks and special "mystery" blocks that release hazards such as toy soldiers and wind up robots, both of which will obstruct and deflect the ball in crazy ways back at Woody. There are also special blocks that grant Woody powers such as a Flameball, a skull, a hammer and even magic potions. Other features include a train that on some screens serves as a screen wide moving obstacle to players' progress and bottom screen corners that can deflect the ball back up the screen. There are 50 different levels in all before you face the final level where the players attempt to defeat The Mad Machine. One difference from most "Breakout" style games that Woody Pop has is the ability once players finish a level to choose a new level from up to three adjacent levels, making the game less linear.
Controls.
Woody Pop on the Sega Mark III and Master System was controlled with a special paddle controller that like the game was only sold in Japan. For the Game Gear it used the standard Game Gear controls.

<doc id="36552974" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36552974" title="Belgian Scrabble Federation">
Belgian Scrabble Federation

The Belgian Scrabble Federation (BSF) () is an association for Belgian Scrabble players (playing in French). The federation has approximately 1,000 members in 60 clubs, and was the first federation for Francophone Scrabble players, founded in 1972, before the unified French Scrabble Federation and the International Francophone Scrabble Federation. As of 2012, the president is Éric Leurquin.
The BSF maintains the national ranking of Francophone Scrabble players and organizes many tournaments of classic Scrabble and Duplicate Scrabble in Belgium. Among these tournaments is the Belgian Francophone Scrabble Championship, which takes place during the Festival de Belgique.
The BSF is a member of the International Francophone Scrabble Federation, and so its members may enter tournaments in any Francophone country. Many Belgian players have qualified for the French World Scrabble Championships which takes place each year in a different city.
Awards.
The most recent (2011) winner of the Belgian Scrabble Championships is Christian Pierre, having won the title 14 times since his first win in 1997. Pierre has also won the French World Scrabble Championships five times, in 1991, 1992, 1994, 1996, and 1998. The most recent World Championship win by a Belgian was Éric Vennin in 2008, in Dakar. Other World Champions include Marc Selis (twice), Hippolyte Wouters, Agnès Lempereur, and Yvon Duval.
Since the BSF's founding, the Individual World Championships have been dominated by Belgians. The first Individual World Champion (Hippolyte Wouters), as well as the first Pairs World Champions, were Belgian. However, Christian Pierre is the only Belgian to win since 1978. No Belgian has yet won the Blitz Championship; Jean-Luc Dives came third in 2006.

Anthropophagous 2000

Anthropophagous 2000 is a 1999 horror film directed by Andreas Schnaas, and written by Karl-Heinz Geisendorf. It is a remake of the 1980 film "Antropophagus".
Plot.
Three Interpol agents meet at a cave where several corpses have been uncovered. While the other agents go for backup, Steven Bauers investigates the cavern, finding a journal under one of the bodies. Bauers skims through the journal, which tells the story of Nikos Karamanlis, beginning with him lost at sea with his daughter and pregnant wife.
The film then shows a couple, Mary and Stuart, camping on a beach, where they are murdered by Nikos. At a train station, Mary and Stuart's friends (Vincent, Marc, Caroll, Rita and Georg) head to a vacation home in Borgo San Lorenzo, where they expect to rendezvous Mary, Stuart and Caroll's husband Stan (who is preoccupied with work). The quintet reach the outskirts of Borgo San Lorenzo, where their RV breaks down. Georg, Rita and Marc go ahead (finding the village full of bodies and abandoned except for an elusive woman in black) while Vincent stays with Caroll, who had twisted her ankle. Nikos kills Vincent, abducts Caroll, moves the RV, and disposes of two nearby campers, Hank and Allan.
Georg, Rita and Marc take shelter in the vacation home, where they find Mary's blind sister, Auriet, hiding in the basement. The next day, the group reach the Karamanlis estate, where Nikos's sister Irena (the woman in black) commits suicide by leaping out a window. Inside the house, Georg finds more bodies and Nikos's journal, which he reads as Marc wanders off, running into Stan. They search for Caroll and Vincent, but Marc falls behind and is impaled on a stake by Nikos. Stan finds Caroll in the cave, and they are confronted by Nikos, who flashes back to accidentally killing his wife (during an argument over whether they should eat their dead daughter) while lost at sea. With his wife dead, Nikos ate her and their daughter to survive. After recollecting, Nikos impales Stan through the head with a machete, and cuts out and eats Caroll's unborn child.
Realizing Marc is gone, Georg, Rita and Auriet look for him, with Auriet being killed by Nikos when she becomes separated from the others. After hours of wandering, Georg and Rita are ambushed by Nikos, who rips Rita's head off. Georg shoots Nikos several times, prompting Nikos to reach into the wounds, rip some of his own innards out, and gnaw on them. Despite the severity of his injuries, Nikos continues to attack Georg and tries to drown him in a pool, but becomes distracted when he hears his wife's voice. Georg gains the upper hand, and beheads Nikos with a shovel, at Nikos's own insistence.
In the present, Bauers ponders how the journal got into the cave, and how it could be so thorough. As he exits the cave, Bauers finds what appears to be Georg's cell phone, and has his head shot off by an unseen assailant.
Reception.
The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre said "Anthropophagous 2000" was "plodding" and "upgrades the splatter by several buckets but keeps the ultimate boredom" and categorized it as worthless. Slasherpool stated the film was "a disgrace to the original" in its review of "Antropophagus".
As Long As It's Deranged wrote "It's apparent from the off that Schnaas is here for the gore and although he tries to make something of the gossamer thin plot it's pretty obvious that Schnaas is not going to let something as trivial as a story get in the way of a great deal of extreme, yet often crude, gore scenes" and "If you like fast and furious splatter then "Anthropophagous 2000" will certainly hit the mark however despite clocking in at a lightweight 78 minutes there will still be times when your fingers will be hovering over the picture search button". Film Bizarro praised the gore, special effects and said it was well-shot for a film of its caliber, but also that it was uncreative, and lacked the suspenseful atmosphere of its predecessor.
Cult Reviews responded positively to "Anthropophagous 2000", the site's only criticisms being that it was hindered by being shot-on-video and that Andreas Schnaas lacked the directorial skill of Joe D'Amato.

William Staub

William Edward Staub (November 3, 1915 – July 19, 2012) was an American mechanical engineer who invented and developed the first consumer treadmill for home use, the PaceMaster 600, during the late 1960s. Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper, who helped to popularize Staub's invention, has described Staub as "a pioneer in exercise — not for the athlete, but for the masses."
Life.
Staub was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on November 3, 1915. He lived in Clifton, New Jersey, for most of his life, residing in the town for more than seventy years. He originally moved to New Jersey to work as an engineer for the propeller division of Curtiss-Wright, an aircraft manufacturer, during World War II. He later founded the Besco Corp., an aerospace components producer headquartered in Clifton, New Jersey. The name "Besco" stood for the "Bill Edward Staub Corporation."
Staub developed the first consumer treadmill after reading the 1968 book, "Aerobics", by Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper. Cooper's book noted that individuals who ran a mile for eight minutes four-to-five times a week would be in better physical condition than those who did not. Staub noticed that there were no inexpensive treadmills for home use at the time and decided to develop a treadmill for his own use. His son Gerald, designed an on-off switch for the machine. Once finished, He sent his prototype, which he called the PaceMaster 600, to Cooper. Cooper enjoyed the invention and found the treadmill's first customers, who included fitness equipment salespeople. In a 2012 interview, Cooper said of Staub's early prototype: "There really wasn’t a practical treadmill in those days  ... no one had come along with a way for people to exercise indoors, in a way that simulated outdoor exercise."
Staub began production of the first home treadmills at his plant in Clifton, New Jersey, before moving production to Little Falls, New Jersey. The success of the treadmill lead Staub to slowly halt his work in the aerospace industry. Instead he focused on the treadmill through his work at Aerobics Inc., a treadmill manufacture founded by Cooper. Staub sold the business to his sons, Gerald Staub and Thomas Staub, in the mid-1990s and retired from the industry. He used the treadmill until two months before his death in 2012.
Outside of engineering, Staub owned the Colonial Lanes bowling alley in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, and was a bowling enthusiast.
In 2006, "Runner's World" magazine paid tribute to Staub in a feature article titled, "Our Favorite Things: 40 Years of Running Gear Innovation." The magazine stated that the PaceMaster 600 eliminated bad weather as a valid excuse to skip running.
William Staub died on July 19, 2012, at the age of 96, at his home in Clifton, New Jersey. His wife, Dorothy, died in 2007, and their daughter, Patricia, died in 1977. Staub was survived by two daughters, Dorothy Kentis and Dolores Colucci-Healey; four sons, William, Norman, Gerald and Thomas; twenty-one grandchildren and fourteen great-grandchildren.

Tivoli Theatre (Chattanooga, Tennessee)

The Tivoli Theatre, also known as the "Tivoli", is a historic theatre in Chattanooga, Tennessee, opening on March 19, 1921. Built between 1919 and 1921 at a cost of $750,000, designed by famed Chicago-based architectural firm Rapp and Rapp and well-known Chattanooga architect Reuben H. Hunt, and constructed by the John Parks Company (general contractors), the theatre was one of the first air-conditioned public buildings in the United States. The theatre was named "Tivoli" after Tivoli, Italy, has cream tiles and beige terra-cotta bricks, has a large red, black, and white marquee with 1,000 chaser lights, and has a large black neon sign that displays "TIVOLI" with still more chaser lights.
Specifications.
The building seats 1,012 in the orchestra, 48 in upper boxes, 78 in the loge, 312 in the upper balcony, 312 in the lower balcony, and 104 in removable orchestra pit seating. Therefore, the Tivoli can hold more than 1,750 people.
The stage's depth is and long. The ornately decorated silver and gold proscenium's width is 47 feet and 8 inches (14.3 meters and 20.3 cm) and is high.
The Tivoli has had two music systems in its lifetime. When the theatre opened in 1921, a Bennett Pipe Organ was used and then replaced in 1924 with a $30,000 Wurlitzer organ. The organ, also known as the Mighty Wurlitzer Theatre Pipe Organ 235 Special, was installed in order to produce live music to accommodate silent films and stage productions. The Mighty Wurlitzer Organ is still playing almost a century later.
History.
Reflecting the Beaux Arts architectural style prevalent in late 19th century and early 20th century America, the theatre contains a high rose-and-gold coffered ceiling, the original box office, a grand lobby with a white terrazzo floor inlaid with forest-green marble and music-motif medallions, crystal chandeliers, an elegant foyer, and red velvet-plush chairs. The Tivoli opened on March 19, 1921 to a concert by the Tivoli Symphony, a screening of Cecil B. DeMille's 1921 film "Forbidden Fruit", and a personal appearance by "Forbidden Fruit"'s Mae Murray. The theater served Chattanooga well for several decades as the chief location for stage and film entertainment in Chattanooga, but went into a steady decline as modern movie theaters started to appear in Chattanooga in the 1950's.
The Tivoli was, at one time, owned by ABC and was later leased to Chattanooga as a performing arts facility. The theatre was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in April 1973. The city of Chattanooga purchased the Tivoli in 1976 for $300,000 after the theater had been in disrepair for some years; Chattanooga's Department of Education, Arts, and Culture currently owns and operates the Tivoli.
In 1979, Chattanooga-based Lyndhurst Foundation gave a $25,000 grant to the then-Chattanooga Arts Council, which is now Allied Arts of Greater Chattanooga, for a feasibility study on restoring the Tivoli. Other grants for renovation included $3.5 million given by Tennessee in 1986, $3.2 million raised by a private campaign by Chattanoogans, and $300,000 given by the city government.
After the Tivoli closed on June 5, 1987 for renovations, which were directed by Robert A. Franklin, the Tivoli reopened on March 29, 1989 with a recital by Marilyn Horne.
Famous movies and shows that have played at the Tivoli.
Some famous actors, actresses, movies, and shows that have played at the Tivoli are listed below:

Gustavo Matamoros

Gustavo Matamoros (b. Caracas, 1957) is a Venezuelan composer, interdisciplinary artist, community organizer and educator who has established his residence in Miami, Florida, US, since 1979.
Biography.
Gustavo Matamoros studied at the University of Miami from 1979 to 1983. He has taught critical and creative listening at the Design and Architecture Senior High School (DASH) and at the Miami International University of Art and Design. Matamoros has also offered periodical lectures about his work with sound.
Cultural organizations.
In 1985, Gustavo Matamoros was one of the founders of the South Florida Composers Alliance, a Miami based organization. Some year later he also participated in the foundation of the Subtropics Experimental Music and Sound Arts Festival, which was created (according to art critic Lysa Oberkreser) “in order to expose Miami to a new music and the fine art of sound.” Since their inception, Matamoros has been the artistic director of both the SFCA Subtropics Festival and the Interdisciplinary Sound Arts Workshop (iSaw). During the 1990s Gustavo Matamoros also co-founded PUNTO Experimental Music Ensemble together with Cuban composer Armando Rodriguez Ruidiaz.
Work.
Gustavo Matamoros catalog of compositions includes numerous pieces for solo electroacoustic media or electroacoustics combined with traditional instruments. It also includes a wide variety of works based on contemporary and experimental techniques such as mixed media, installations, sound portraits, radiophony, text and video. He has composed a series of “Retratos” (Portraits) based on sound materials produced by the subjects portrayed on the pieces. Venezuelan composers Marianela Arocha and Adina Izarra have referred to those pieces as follows: “From the 90’s onward many forms of mix repertoire are present, also more research and improvising can be seen among the (Venezuelan) composers. Like in Gustavo Matamoros Retratos where each performer chooses its own material which the composer transforms on tape and sets for the interaction in concert. The composer himself speaks of gesture and morphology: all sounds are possible and allowed; all of them make sense within different contexts”. Some of the subjects for those “Portraits” are: guitarist and composer Flores Chaviano, oboist and composer Joseph Celli, poet Bob Gregory, double-bassist Luis Gómez Imbert and composer Ricardo Dal Farra.
Gustavo Matamoros has studied and explored the sound characteristics of an uncommon musical instrument, the musical saw. He has composed many pieces based on the utilization of this instrument and has also utilized other instruments of his own creation on his pieces. Matamoros organized a musical saw quartet called SEE that included the following performers: Ryan Agnew, Ulrike Heydenreich and Stephanie Lie. They offered their first performance during an ACA residency with Robert Ashley at Smyrna Beach.
Gustavo Matamoro’s music has been presented at numerous cultural events in the US, Latin America and Europe.

<doc id="36553447" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36553447" title="Kitáb-i-Badí'">
Kitáb-i-Badí'

The Kitáb-i-Badí’ (Persian: كتاب بديع Arabic: الكتاب البديع) is one of many books held sacred by followers of the Bahá'í Faith. Twice the size of the Kitáb-i-Íqán, it contains insights into the prophecies of the Báb concerning 'Him Whom God shall make manifest' and was written in defence of the Bahá'í Revelation. The work has not yet been translated into English.
Background.
The book was composed by Bahá'u'lláh, the Founder of the Bahá'í Faith, in 1867/68 in Adrianople. It is in Persian but includes quotations from the Báb's writings in Arabic.
Mírzá Mihdíy-i-Rashtí, a supporter of Bahá'u'lláh's half-brother, Mírzá Yahyá, and his companion Siyyid Muhammad wrote a letter to Áqá Muhammad-'Alí, a companion of Bahá'u'lláh, containing various arguments against Bahá'u'lláh's claim to be 'He Whom God shall make manifest', whose advent was promised in the Báb's writings. Áqá Muhammad-'Alí presented the letter to Bahá'u'lláh, who composed the Kitáb-i-Badí’ in response. As with many other works by Bahá'u'lláh, the entire text was dictated by Bahá'u'lláh, speaking in the voice of his amanuensis — in this case, Áqá Muhammad-'Alí.
Contents of the book.
Shoghi Effendi referred to the work as Bahá'u'lláh's "apologia, written to refute the accusations levelled against Him by Mírzá Mihdíy-i-Rashtí, corresponding to the Kitáb-i-Iqan, revealed in defense of the Bábí Revelation".
The book consists of short quotes from Mírzá Mihdí's letter followed by numerous pages refuting each argument. Bahá'u'lláh includes extensive quotations from the Báb's writings in support of his refutations. A major portion of the work is devoted to explaining the Báb's prophecies concerning 'Him Whom God shall make manifest'. He includes numerous quotations from the Báb's writings, such as the following (referring to 'Him Whom God shall make manifest'):
Bahá'u'lláh includes strong language concerning Mírzá Mihdí, whom he refers to as the 'wicked one', 'the evil plotter', 'the impious', 'the impudent', 'the outcast', 'the faithless soul', 'the froward', and 'he who contends with God'. He also refers to Siyyid Muhammad in the text as 'one who joined partners with God', 'the prime mover of mischief', 'the embodiment of wickedness and impiety', and 'one accursed of God'. Bahá'u'lláh furthermore stigmatizes his half-brother, Mírzá Yahyá, as the idol of the Bábí community and accuses Siyyid Muhammad of disseminating Bahá'u'lláh's writings in his own name.

Uznach Abbey

St Otmar's Abbey, Uznach, Switzerland, is a monastery of the Congregation of Missionary Benedictines of Saint Ottilien. It was established in the wake of World War I to expand the Congregation's resources beyond Germany. To this day, the monastery continues to procure funds and send personnel to Benedictine missions in the Global South. The current superior of the monastic community is Fr Adelrich Staub, Prior Administrator.
History.
Andreas Amrhein, the founder of the Missionary Benedictines, himself grew up in Switzerland, where support of the Catholic missions was widespread. Between the time Amrhein began recruiting vocations and the outbreak of World War I, twenty Swiss compatriots had joined his young mission society. The war brought about the expulsion of nearly 70 German members of the Congregation from German East Africa, illustrating the drawbacks of having too great a focus on personnel from one country. To continue mission work, Archabbot Norbert Weber decided that it was necessary for the Missionary Benedictines to expand into non-mission lands. 
On September 16, 1919, Fr Adelrich Mühlebach, a Swiss citizen and member of the Congregation, opened a mission procure in Uznach, near the eastern shores of Lake Zürich, 50 km from Zürich. Following negotiations with the British government, which now controlled what had been German East Africa, this new foundation was recognized as the "Swiss Benedictine Father". This permission allowed the Missionary Benedictines to replace some of the German members who had been expelled from Tanganyika. 
For the next decades, Uznach acted primarily as a mission procure, rather than a true Benedictine monastery. The Congregation decided that a true monastic spirit should be fostered there, and in 1963, the community constructed a new monastery, dedicated to St Otmar. However, Swiss law prevented the foundation of monasteries, so the foundation remained a priory until the repeal of the relevant law in 1973. On January 6, 1982, the Congregation elevated the monastery to the status of an abbey, and Fr Ivo Auf der Maur became the first Abbot of Uznach. A new church was consecrated in 1988.
Apostolate.
While maintaining the lifestyle of Benedictine monks, the abbey's community continues the important work of procuring funds for the Congregation's international missions. This includes the publication of a mission periodical, which is regularly distributed to the abbey's thousands of benefactors. 
Pastoral work is also a key part of the abbey's apostolate. Many of the priests help in parishes, and provide spiritual guidance to religious communities, the sick, and the elderly. Additionally, the monastery also hosts retreats and provides catechetical instruction.
The Abbey of Uznach continues to send a large number of brothers and priests to the missions of the Congregation.
Personnel.
As of May 18, 2011, the monastic community of Uznach included twenty monks in perpetual vows, around half of them ordained. Some of these monks are on assignment away from the abbey, including those at the foundation in Kazakhstan. There are also two brothers in temporal vows.
Fr Adelrich Staub was elected Prior Administrator in 2010, succeeding Marian Eleganti, Titular Bishop of Lamdia, who had been the second Abbot of Uznach (1999–2009).

Battle of Odžak

Battle of Odžak was the last World War II battle in Europe. The battle began on 19 April 1945 and lasted until 25 May 1945, 17 days after the end of the war in Europe. The combatants were the Croatian Armed Forces commanded by Petar Rajkovačić and the Yugoslav Partisans commanded by Miloš Zekić. The battle took place in the Bosnian town of Odžak. The battle was a Pyrrhic victory for the Partisans.
The Battle of Odžak was suppressed in the Communist Yugoslavia. The only news about the battle came out on 1 June 1975 in a Serbian newspaper "NIN".
First stage.
In May 1945, the Croatian Armed Forces (HOS) started to retreat towards Austria after Ante Pavelić's decision that they wouldn't defend Zagreb; however, some 10,000 soldiers led by brothers Ivan and Petar Rajkovačić decided to not retreat. On 19 April 1945, they possessed town of Odžak and 24 nearby villages and made a stronghold at the mouth of Bosnia river entering Sava river. The stronghold was successfully defended for more than a month, despite the attacks of Partisan units coordinated with the artillery, tanks and even air force. The Odžak stronghold fell on 25 May, 15 days after the end of war in Europe.
The Serbian newspaper NIN, reported that between 19 and 28 April, there was a fierce combat with constant Partisan charges at the "Ustaše" strongholds. Between those two dates, HOS defenders killed around 630 Partisans and destroyed an entire battalion of the 27th Division and killed a commander of the 16th Brigade of the same division, Spaso Mičić. From the equipments, the Partisans lost three batteries of artillery, three mortars and one anti-tank gun. The NIN also reports that "the enemy was much more dangerous and insidious then a German soldier... the "Ustaše" fought to death."
The remaining members of HOS were defending what it left of the Independent State of Croatia, an narrow area between Bosna and Sava that included Novigrad, Donji Brezik, Vlaška Mala, Odžak and Mrka Ada. Moreover, in that area, there was a lot of Bosnian Muslim refugees from Kladanj, Plehana, Žepče, Sivše, Gračanica and nearby populated places. The Supreme Command of the 3rd Partisan Corps, composed of 27th, 28th and 53rd Division, ordered immediate attack on the HOS' stronghold or the divisional headquarters would be considered responsible.
Vlaška Mala combats.
Eventually, the Partisans pushed away HOS to Vlaška Mala, a village without any natural defence line, it was a clear field. Some HOS commanders that found themselves in a hopeless situation started to negotiate with the partisans, but negotiations ended in partisan attack. Smaller number of HOS soldiers surrendered to them as POWs, but they were later found mutilated by the HOS soldiers. Such actions of partisans probably made the HOS to fight so fanatically. HOS built the trenches, every trench was enough for a squad. As the terrain was plane, the defenders had a review of all access roads. As their munition supply was low, they tried to achieve as much as possible hits. The defenders made a tactic very odd to the Partisan commanders, they would let Partisan units to approach 10 metres and then would open fire at them. The Partisan losses were massive. Many Partisans were left wounded at the battlefield without any possible help. Another contributor to the massive Partisan losses was their effort to save the flags of units. Many Partisans would be killed just because they tried to save their flag.
Ustaše counterattack.
The defenders' stronghold was attacked from direction of Duge Njive and Lipik. The Partisans would launch an attack after attack, but they failed to push away the defenders. In order to enable his units a wider movement space, Rajkovačić ordered expansion of the defence line. He commanded the left wing, while he let Ivan Calušić to command the western one. Rajkovačić divided his units into four platoons and a company commanded by Nikola Šanjić also joined him. The local volunteers that were under Rajkovačić's command, joined the Calušić's unit, as Rajkovačić expected full discipline and readiness, which they didn't have as they weren't professional soldiers. Rajkovačić also formed the storm units which would execute counterattacks, while a smaller unit, which he commanded would be in the center of a counter-attack. Those in the last line of defence, positioned in the very village, were assigned to brake the Partisan defence lines. When at the beginning of May 1945, the Partisan attacks started to falter, Rajkovačić ordered an counter-attack. The Partisans didn't expected a massive counterattack and their defence was broken very fast, while the defenders captured the Municipality Building, which were also the Partisan headquarters. The battle was so brutal that every home in Odžak was destroyed, while every field was a scaffold. After HOS recaptured Odžak and built the new defence lines which will last until 25 May. The Partisans were decimated. The 20th Serb Storm Brigade entered an area controlled by HOS, and within a few hours, the who brigade was killed.The Serb Partisan units, exhausted from fighting, proclaimed the unarmed civilians the ""Ustaše" criminals" so they massacred helpless elderly, women and children.
Group of HOS, led by Ibrahim Pjanić and Avdaga Hasić decided to make a breakthorugh against the 14th Partisan Brigade. The 14th Brigade was known as a "brigade that accustomed to victory"; however, they run away in front of the attack and let the group to breakthrough without any fight. During the Battle of Odžak, a struggle for every ditch and house was fierce, while objects would be taken only with help of artillery and air force. As reported by NIN, "in order to capture an object, every "Ustaše" needs to be killed". HOS continued to fight even after the Partisan aviation dropped bombs and used machine guns. Commander of the defence, Petar Rajkovačić was wounded two times by the air force strike, but refused to surrender. He committed suicide on 25 May 1945, on the day when Battle of Odžak was over.
Partisan decisive attack.
The broken partisan units were reinforced with the elements of the 27th Division from Tuzla, composed out of 19th Birćanska Brigade, 20th Romanija Brigade and 16th Brigade. Meanwhile, the famous Partisan commander, Mato Belić, who known the town of Odžak very well, supposed to brake the defence and capture the town. In order to recapture Odžak, the Partisans were equipped with the most modern weapons of the time. The casualties weren't important, the Odžak had to be captured, as ordered by Josip Broz Tito, the Marshall of Yugoslavia. The Partisans equipped artillery, mortars and the Soviet "Katyusha" rocket launchers. They were also connected by the radio so the Partisans launched attack by attack, however, they were always thrown away by the defenders. Tito's birthday was very near, so the Supreme Command insisted that the defence must be broken before the birthday. Members of the General Staff decided to send the air force. They composed two squadrons which travelled from Belgrade to Odžak. Those aircraft operated on 23 and 24 May. They bombed Odžak, Ada, Balegovac, Dubica, Prud, Vojskova and Osječak, while the most bombs have been dropped on Vlaška Mala. The Vlaška Mala bunker and elementary school were completely destroyed; the elementary school sreved as Rajkovačić's headquarters. Partisans also used the long-range artillery together with bombings. Majority of victims were, however, the civilians. HOS divided into two groups and planned the breakthrough. The one group was order to breakthrough the Odžak hospital and save the wounded. HOS lines were broken and the strongest town's stronghold, the Nuića Štala, had also fallen. The combat in the town itself lasted to night of 24 and 25 May. On that night, both groups started the breakthrough. One group moved towards the mountainous part of the municipality, while other moved to Prud. In Vlaška Mala, tens of soldiers left around the Nuića Štala. More than 700 defenders that were in Vlaška Mala succeeded to brake the partisan encirclement and moved to Potočani and Lipa. The group that was moving towards Prud succeeded to avoid one encirclement, but entered the other. Those who defended the Nuića Štala fought to last man. After they were killed, the Partisans captured the hospital and within it found a lot of wounded and civilians. They were brutally massacred. Partisans also killed every civilian that they had found. They were thrown in a mass grave in the nearby garden. The place is known as the Nuić Cemetery.
Aftermath.
The first group that failed to brake another encirclement was taken away to captivity. The other group succeeded to enter Lipa and Plandišće. The Partisans in Odžak started to arrest all males from 15 years and older, often killing boys around ten years of age. Those defenders captured were taken in front of a firing squad & executed. Those who surrendered to Partisans were also immediately executed. The Partisans would kill anyone without making any report. The last remaining group of defenders fled in to the surrounding forest and continued to fight as guerrilla's. The last man of this group was killed in the spring of 1947 in Lipa.
Suppression of the battle.
In Communist Yugoslavia, mentioning of the Battle of Odžak was prohibited . Any mention of the battle was considered "a plot against the Yugoslav Brotherly Union". The Serbian newspaper "NIN" was the only paper to write about it. It published two feuilletons and published some documents connected to the battle. In order to avoid mentioning the battle, the official "liberation day" of Odžak wasn't listed as 25 May but 14 April.
The battle is thoroughly described in a number of books, for example, in a 1969 book on 53rd Division, 1981 book on 16th Muslim Brigade, 1983 book on 27th East Bosnian Division, and 1983 book on 14th Central Bosnian Brigade.

Postage stamps and postal history of Pietersburg

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Pietersburg.
After the fall of Pretoria to the British in June 1900 during the Boer War, the Transvaal government re-located to Pietersburg but by March 1901 supplies of stamps were short and the Boer government authorised a series of type-set stamps for use within their area of control. The stamps were issued on 20 March 1901 and remained in use until Pietersburg was captured on 9 April, and as late as May in other places.
Although only in use for a short time, the stamps include a very large number of varieties caused by the conditions and method of their production which make them popular with specialists.

Homotopy perturbation method

The homotopy perturbation method (HPM) is a series expansion method used in the solution of nonlinear partial differential equations. The method employs a homotopy transform to generate a convergent series solution of differential equations. This gives flexibility in the choice of basis functions for the solution and the linear inversion operators (as compared to the Adomian decomposition method), while still retaining a simplicity that makes the method easily understandable from the standpoint of general perturbation methods. The HPM was introduced by Ji-Huan He of Shanghai University in 1998. The HPM is a special case of the homotopy analysis method (HAM) developed by Liao Shijun in 1992. The HAM uses a so-called convergence-control parameter to guarantee the convergence of approximation series over a given interval of physical parameters.

Ching-cheng Huang

Ching-cheng Huang (1912–1943) ( 黃清埕 ; also 黃清呈 ; pinyin: Huang Qingcheng; in Taiwan: Huang Ching-cheng; also: Huang Ch’ing-ch’eng ) is a Taiwanese sculptor. He is counted among the important pioneers of Taiwanese modern art. Prof. Lai mentions him in one breath with Ju Ming (朱銘). Huang’s sculpture “Study of a Head” (頭像 ‘tóuxiàng’) was the first modern work of art in Taiwan that was declared a part of the island’s cultural heritage that is protected by a new law passed in 2009. It is exhibited in the Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts ((高雄市立美術館館長 Gāoxióng shìlì měishùguǎn guǎnzhǎng)).
Biography.
Ching-cheng Huang was born in Eastern Pond Village(池東村 chí dōngcūn), Siyu Township, on Western Islet (si yu = xi yǔ 西嶼 ), a small island of the Penghu Islands group (澎湖). This island group had been ceded to Japan by the Chinese government in 1895, like the rest of Taiwan and the Ryu-Kyo Islands, after the First Sino-Japanese War. 
Ching-cheng Huang’s father owned a pharmacy. Ching-cheng Huang, who was raised in a fairly wealthy family, showed an interest in creative activity at an early age. As a boy, he already did small figures made of clay, his elder brother later remembered. He also painted, showing considerable talent which prompted a teacher to encourage him. Because the pharmacy was located in Kaohsiung (高雄), a major location in South Taiwan which was already a fairly big city, he was sent there in 1925, in order to attend Kaohsiung Senior High School. He dropped out, however, because he dedicated too much time to painting. Therefore, his father had him educated by a private teacher. Because his father wanted him to become a pharmacist, he was sent to a teacher of pharmacology in 1933. Then, he went on to Tokyo, for advanced studies in pharmacology.
A young art student in Tokyo.
Huang’s desire was to be an artist, however. In 1936, being just 24, Ching-cheng Huang was admitted to a Japanese art academy, the "Tōkyō Bijutsu Gakkō" (東京美術学校) or Tokyo School of Fine Arts, an art academy that had a good reputation.
When Ching-cheng Huang had departed for Tokyo in 1936, the Second Sino-Japanese war was less than a year away, and the terrible Nanking Massacre would happen in November 1937. Chauvinism and militarist sentiments were on the rise. The situation deteriorated with the outbreak of the war against China (1937), and even more so since 1939/40 when the democracy that still had existed up to a point in the late 1930s, was rapidly suspended.
Ching-cheng Huang was violating the dominant ethical code that required filial piety when he was not studying pharmacology. This had consequences. “When his father became aware of this matter, in anger he stopped sending him money for his living expenses and tuition. (…) His brother Huang Qingshun (Ching-Shuan Huang) secretly lent him money, however, and this aid helped him, in part, to complete his studies.”
A young artist in Tokyo who revered Beethoven.
The fact that in an expensive city like Tokyo, his brother’s financial support proved insufficient had a good side effect. The young man was compelled to work professionally as an artist while still in art school. In these highly productive years, he created a considerable number of art works, among them various busts. He also did “full body sculptures” and “seated sculptures.”
Among the works created by Ching-cheng Huang, there were a number of sculptures of Beethoven. Beethoven was a composer whom the artist greatly admired, as his elder brother confirmed later on.
Huang’s interest in music and more specifically, in music from the West, is partly explained by his close relationship with a young pianist, "Guixiang Li" (李桂香, also: Kwei-Hsiang Lee). There was more to it, however. Generally speaking, Ludwig van Beethoven and Auguste Rodin stood for modernism at the time, as Y.-L. Hsueh points out. More specifically, under the conditions that existed in Tokyo in the 1930s and 40s, Beethoven and his music stood for cosmopolitanism and a thirst for freedom.
David B. Dennis has pointed out that Beethoven’s "Ode to Joy" was always interpreted as an “Ode to Freedom” by progressives around the world. “Beethoven’s enthusiasm about the French Revolution” is well-known. As a Rhinelander, Beethoven had cherished Napoleonic reforms that increased civil liberties and introduced a progressive legal frame of reference, the Napoleonic Code or "Code civil". In Chinese art, literature, and music, criticism of rulers has often been allusive and indirect. Huang’s choice of Beethoven turns out to be in line with this tradition, that “certain cultural heroes often find favor with Chinese artists (…)” because it allows them to take a stand.
The sculptor Huang.
Huang’s relationship with "Guixiang Li" (with whom he shared a passion for Beethoven) is not only revealed indirectly in his Beethoven sculptures. Among the few sculptures of Ching-cheng Huang that are known to have survived World War II and that are exhibited in museums in Taiwan, there is a bust that is titled "“My Girlfriend Guei-shiang”". It is part of the collection of the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts in Taichung (Guólì Táiwān měishùguǎn/ Táizhōng shì 國立台灣美術館 / 台中市).
MOUVE.
In 1937, Ching-cheng Huang teamed up with a number of graduate students at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts in order to form an artist group that would organize joint exhibitions. According to G. Huang (Huáng Guāngnán 黃光男) and X. Liao (Liào Xīntián廖新田), these young artists “seceded from the Tai Yang artists’ association” when they formed their own group. G. Huang and X. Liao notice the group’s “non-mainstream atmosphere”.
The anti-mainstream artists soon called their group MOUVE (derived from the French word "mouvement"). Prof. Lai also mentions another term by which the artists referred to their group, writing that the name chosen by the group was “Action Art Group (or MOUVE painting group).” “Action Art Group” in Chinese is “xíngdòng měishù jítuán 行動美術集團.” 
According to Chin-hsien Li, it was “Lán Yùn-dēng who recommended the name MOUVE.” Chin-hsien Li points out that at first, the young artists only wrote MOUVE “in Japanese Katakana” which emphasized the term’s French origin. No Chinese equivalent of the name existed initially. It was a symbolic choice that indicated a turn to the ‘new,’ away from the traditional art embraced by scholars and artists still educated during the era of the Qing Dynasty, but also away from the academic Western-style painting practiced by many artists in Tokyo. The rules that were drawn up by the group stressed research or studies: “1. Our goal is to study from each other frequently. 2. Each year, exhibitions of our studies shall not be fixed in numbers but shall be held when and where suitable (…)” 
Hsien-tsung Lai refers to the group as “anti-establishment.” Jen-yi Lai specifically refers to the “Bohemian spirit” revealed in the works of one painter of this group, Jui-Lin Hung (Hóng Ruìlín 洪瑞麟 ), whom she singles out. But the Bohemian attitude was symptomatic of all members of this group. 
Indeed, “MOUVE, at the time, was free. Works were exhibited every year, no works were excluded. Regardless of how often he would take part, regardless of how many works he wanted to show, every member could participate anytime, anywhere in the joint exhibition. This was the so-called MOUVE spirit.” Clearly, “the name was a symbol of avant-garde and of youth.” 
On March 19, 1938, the artists who had formed the new group, Wan-chuan Chang (Zhāng Wànchuán 張萬傳 ), Jui-Lin Hung (Hóng Ruìlín 洪瑞麟 ), Dewang Chen (Chén Déwàng 陳德旺 ), Chi-ch’eng Lu (Lǚ Jīzhèng 呂基正), Chunde Chen (Chén Chūndé 陳春德 ), Ching-cheng Huang (Huang Qing-cheng 黃清埕 ), and Liu-jen Teng (Děng Liùrén 等六人) had their first group exhibition. Except for Huang, who was a sculptor and painter, they were all painters.
The painter Huang.
Critics at the time saw Ching-cheng Huang not only as a remarkable sculptor but also as a gifted painter. It has been emphasized that “(d)uring his study in Japan, he (…) specialized in oil painting and held a solo exhibition.” Oil on canvas was preferred to ink and to water color techniques by a majority of modernist East Asian artists. In this, Huang was not different from other Taiwan-born painters who studied in the ‘Western painting’ division of a Japanese art academy.
Chun-hsien Li (李俊賢 Li Jùnxián), art historian at the Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts, has noted the distinctive traits and the novelty of Huang’s paintings. He writes, “If we look at Ching-cheng Huang’s work - "Black Woman" 黑衣女人 (hēi yī nǚrén), we get what may be described as a very direct sense of his use of color, which is very different from that found in the artistic environment of that era.” Prof. Lai also praises Huang when he speaks of “the mysterious painting, ‘Black Woman’ (…).”
Exhibitions.
In 1939, sculptures by Ching-cheng Huang and by another Taiwanese artist, Hsia-yu Chen 陳夏雨, were accepted by a jury and “included in the Imperial Exhibition” (Teiten Empire Exhibition or Imperial Exhibition, in Japanese: 帝展.) of that year.
A year later, in May 1940, the ‘MOUVE’ group organized “a ‘MOUVE Exhibition’ of three artists” – Wan-chuan Chang (張萬傳), ( Yong Xie 謝國庸), and Ching-Cheng Huang – in the Tainan Public Hall (Táinán gōnghuì táng 台南公會堂.), Tainan (台南), South Taiwan. 
In the same year (1940), Huang received an award of the Japanese Sculptors’ Association and it was “recommended” that he should “become a member of the association.”
MOUVE versus Tayang.
MOUVE, which Ching-cheng Huang had been founding together with several young Taiwan-born artists in Tokyo, was now, “at first glance, avant-garde, fresh air, so to speak, and the group’s members were painting in a new way. But it was a small group after all, no match for the power of the mainstream, especially the ‘Taiyang Art Association.’ Lu Chi-cheng and Chen Chunde soon took refuge to ‘Taiyang,’ and thus in the following year (1941) there was a pause in the group’s activities.” Another reason for this ‘pause’ may have been Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor and thus, the outbreak of the Pacific War. “At the end of 1940”, the group – and that meant: the majority of its members – had already left Japan. “With the advent of the Pacific war” when “MOUVE was taken to be an English name” by the authorities, the artists were forced “to change its name.” The name was now changed to “Sculpture and Painting Association” (zàoxíng měishù xiéhuì 造型美術協會). Because some old members had left, it was a smaller group now. Under the new name Sculpture and Painting Association, the group soon “made a come-back with another exhibition,” however. Those who participated in this group exhibition (in Taiwan rather than Tokyo) were “Yün-teng Lan (Lán Yùndēng藍 運燈), Yen Shui-long (Yán Shuǐlóng顏水龍) and Cho-sao Fan (Fàn Zhuōzào范倬造), in addition to the remaining original members.”
A year later, “MOUVE ran (…) out of steam, winding things up in a frenzy like a whirlwind, and it soon disappeared without a trace, after having recorded the flowering and frustration of the opposition faction of Taiwan's art world.”
Huang worked in Tainan during summer vacations.
Whereas other MOUVE artists like Jui-lin Hung had already returned to Taiwan for good, Ching-Cheng Huang remained based in Tokyo. But “every summer, he would return to Taiwan for vacation,” as the curator of the Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts (KMFA) notes. “Most of the time, he would live in the Tainan house of Kuo-Jong Hsieh (Xiè Guó-yōng 謝國鏞).” During these stays in Tainan, he “made a lot of sculptures for renowned officials of the Tainan district and had the support of local people in Tainan.” In Tokyo, Huang did not only complete his studies at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts. Soon recognized for his outstanding talent and accomplishment, he was honored by being invited to participate in several important exhibitions, among them the Bunten Art Exhibition of the Japanese Ministry of Education.
Huang’s premature death in 1943.
In 1943, Ching-cheng Huang was offered a teaching position at the Beiping Art School in Peking which was then a city occupied by the Japanese army. Planning to go to Taiwan first, the artist boarded “the passenger liner Takachiho Maru in Kobe, Japan” together with Guixiang Li. The ship was “torpedoed by an American submarine” as it approached Keelung, the main harbor in North Taiwan. About 1,000 passengers died. Few survived. Ching-cheng Huang was 31 when he lost his life. Huang’s premature death was a considerable loss that was felt in the art world of Taiwan.
The ill fortune of modern Taiwanese art in the late 1940s and the 1950s.
The fact that Ching-cheng Huang died prematurely may have saved him from suffering the fate of artists and writers who became victims of political repression. Death at age 31 also meant that he could not produce a full-fledged, mature oeuvre. Huang’s premature death certainly was a considerable loss that was felt in the art world of Taiwan. But there were more blows to come that would hurt the development of modern art anchored in the socio-culture of the island. The rebellious Jui-lin Hung, a leading figure of the MOUVE group, who had already returned before 1943, became a miner and for several years could not afford oil colors and canvas. The painter Chen Cheng-po was shot by the KMT army in Chiayi in 1947, becoming one of the many victims of the so-called 228 incident. Under these conditions, “(t)he development of new art movement(s) was in fact not a smooth one,” as Prof. Chiung-jui Hsiao writes. By mid-1950, “Martial Law came into effect.” Now, Huang Jung-ts’an (Huang Rong-tsan / Huáng Róngcàn黃榮燦), an artist who did realist woodcuts and who was a friend of the painter Chun-chen Li (Li Zhòngshēng 李仲生), “was arrested.” He was accused of “espionage in 1951 and (…) executed the next year.” According to Prof. Hsiao, this “event influenced avant-garde artists who were promoting modern art at that time. (…) In 1955, Chao Chung-Hsiang left for Spain because he got the scholarship to study, while Chu Teh-Chun went to France. (…) The school supporting Ho Tieh-hua was on the downside on account of political tensions. His art fairs started to be oppressed. Chuang Shih-ho was admonished and forced to move back to Ping-Tung (i.e. Pingtung City or Píng dōng 屏東) (…) Ho Tieh-hua, on the other hand, (…) left for America in 1959 for good. In the same year, Lin Shen-yang attended the Sao Paulo Exhibition in Brazil as a judge and never returned.” –
On the other hand, there were also those who would try to work under the conditions that existed. Thus, several of Ching-cheng Huang’s colleagues that had participated in the MOUVE artists’ group founded a new group, the Era Art Association, in 1954.
Today’s critical assessment of Huang as a sculptor.
Today, many art historians and artists in Taiwan agree on Huang’s pioneering role, as a modernist Taiwan-born sculptor. Together with two other sculptors, Tien-shen Pu (Pú Tiānshēng蒲添生) who was born in 1912 like Huang, and Hsia-yu Chen (Chen Xiayu 陳夏雨) who was 5 years younger, Ching-cheng Huang belongs to the young generation of early Taiwan modernists who followed in the footsteps of Tu-shui Huang and who surpassed him in a way. Insofar, few would disagree with Ya-li Chen that “Huang Tu-shui(黃土水), Huang Qing-cheng(i.e. Ching-cheng Huang) 黃清呈), Chen Hsia-yu(陳夏雨) and Pu Tien-sheng(蒲添生) were the most important sculptors in Taiwan” during the Colonial era that came to an end in 1945. Huang’s creative role as one of the few Taiwan-born pioneers of early modern sculpture assures him a permanent place in the history of modern art in Taiwan.
Ching-cheng Huang’s life and work: subject matter of two films.
In 2005, Ching-cheng Huang’s life and work became the theme of a feature film by the Taiwanese film director Yu-shan Huang. The film, released in 2005 and titled The Strait Story, was discussed in two academic publications.
Ching-cheng Huang’s life and work is also at the center of a documentary, “The Forgotten: Reflections on Eastern Pond” (2008) by Yu-Shan Huang.

Fort Hommet

Fort Hommet (or Fort Houmet) is a fortification on Vazon Bay headland (or "hommet") in Castel, Guernsey. It is built on the site of fortifications that date back to 1680, and consists of a Martello tower from 1804, later additions during the Victorian Era, and bunkers and casemates that the Germans constructed during World War II.
The Martello tower was constructed after the onset of the Napoleonic Wars, and during the tenure (1803-1813) of Lieutenant Governor General Sir John Doyle. To simplify matters, Doyle had a local builder named Gray construct the tower, and two others, see below, under the rubric of "fieldworks", thereby bypassing the Ordnance Corps. 
The Fort Hommet tower, like the other two Guernsey martello towers, Fort Grey and Fort Saumarez, was intended as a keep for the battery in which it was placed. The Guernsey martellos are all smaller than the British martello towers, with the Fort Saumarez and Fort Hommet towers being smaller than the Fort Grey tower. Each mounted a 24-pounder carronade on the roof to support the battery. Fort Saumarez and Fort Hommet also have exterior staircases up to the second floor. 
During the Victorian Era, the fort received additional batteries and barracks. In 1852, 68-pounder and 8" shell guns replaced some of the 24-pounder guns in the batteries. 
The largest addition, however, occurred during World War II and the German occupation of the Channel Islands. The Germans recognized the enduring utility of the site and fortified it further, creating the Stützpunkt (Strongpoint) Rotenstein. 
After the liberation of Guernsey in 1945, the British Army and the islanders stripped the fortifications. By the late 1940s all the metal fittings including guns and blast doors had been removed for scrap. Many of the bunkers including the gun-casemate at Fort Hommet, were buried in an attempt to return the coastal landscape to its pre-war condition.
More recently, the States of Guernsey have restored parts of the fort, and particularly the Fort Hommet 10.5 cm Coastal Defence Gun Casement Bunker. This is now open to visitors, though with restrictive hours.

Askari X

Askari X, the stage name of Ricky Murdock, is a hip-hop artist from Oakland, California. He has released 3 albums, is on numerous compilation albums, and has been a guest on several albums. Stic.man and M-1 of Dead Prez refer to Askari X in their music and credit him as one of their main musical influences. Askari X advocates Black Power, Black Liberation, and Islam in his lyrics. His sound is characterized by slow drum beats and a verbal flow similar to Tupac Shakur. Askari X is philosophically aligned with the African People's Socialist Party and the Uhuru Movement, and is a student of the Islamic teacher Ansar El Muhammad. His style may considered as conscious rap.
Early life.
In an autobiographical song titled "Moma" Askari X refers to experiencing domestic abuse against himself and his mother when he was 7 years old. He talks about being unsatisfied with school, experiencing persecution and systematic racism from the school system and the government. When he rebelled against the oppression he experienced in school, the school labeled Askari X as crazy and tried to place him in foster care.
Askari X joined the Bay Area, West Coast hip hop scene when he was 16 years old. His career started with the rap group the Righteous Black Guerrilas (RBG). The neighborhood of 72nd and Lacey Street in Eastmont, Oakland, where some of the RBG crew grew up, was referenced in later Askari X songs.
Askari X encountered the Uhuru Movement, then Islam as taught by Ansar El Muhammad, whose teachings began as a prison study group. Both are major influences in his music.
Music career.
Askari X co-founded the group Righteous Black Guerrillas who released the record "Ansars" in 1991. Askari X's first album, "Ward of the State", was released in 1992 while he was incarcerated. He has performed and recorded with Seagram, Rappin Ron & Ant Diddley Dog, 3X Krazy, Tajai from the Hieroglyphics, Mr. Ill, The Delinquents, & The Whoridas, Stic.Man of Dead Prez.
He has released three solo albums: "Ward of the State" with Righteous Records, "Message to the Black Man" with Slow Motion Records, and "Return of Askari X (a.k.a. Ricky Murdock)" with Success Entertainment. His career started with the Righteous Black Guerrilas album Ansars. He co-produced the album by Dead Prez (M1 + stic.man) Presents - "Get Free Or Die Tryin (Turn Off The Radio: The Mixtape Vol. 2)"
Askari X has also appeared in several compilation projects, including the track "Fucked in the Game" on the album "Cell Block Compilation" produced by Cell Block and Priority Records, on the track "Rumble in the Jungle" on the album "Pusha' Man's Compilation" produced by The Road Productions, on the track "Peckerwood, Peckerwood" on the "International Blunt Funk Compilation" produced by In-A-Minute Records and Blunt Funk Records, on the tracks "Street Soldier" and "Rap" on the "Herm - Solo Album" produced by Black Power Productions, and the track "Fuck that P.D." on the album "The Monopolation" produced by Legal Dope Records.
Personal life.
In one interview between prison stints, Askari X referred to jail as “the hidden university,” saying that he wrote much of his rap material there. “The solitude gave me time and inspiration to come up with new raps," he said. As for the initial crime he was convicted of, he has always maintained his innocence. "I’m sure it was a set up...The police said that I robbed a bank and was armed, even though I had seven witnesses to prove otherwise," he said to an interviewer in a 1990's interview reiterating the lyrics of "Ward Of The State Pt II."
In 2010 and 2011, he was incarcerated at Folsom State Prison.
RBG.
Askari X has been credited by some sources as having created the term RBG as an acronym for "Righteous Black Guerillas" before Dead Prez. Askari X first used this meaning for RBG when he co-founded the rap group "Righteous Black Guerrilas". Askari X was featured on a number of Dead Prez songs, including "Scared to Die" and the news report "Hood News" which was released on the DP album Get Free Or Die Tryin (Turn Off the Radio (The mixtape vol. 2 )). Dead Prez have credited Askari X in their use of the term RBG and have credited him in numerous tracks, including the track "Hood News" off their album "Get Free Or Die Tryin (Turn Off the Radio (The mixtape vol. 2 ))", saying "And today in the hood news: Where it might not be good news, but it sure is hood news, we ask what's really hood with the lock-down of Oakland RBG emcee Askari X."RBG is also known in this context as "Red, Black, Green", the colors of the flag of the Pan-African Movement, and has many other associated meanings.

The Boy Who Predicted Earthquakes

The Boy Who Predicted Earthquakes is a short story by American writer Margaret St. Clair (1911–1995). It was first published in 1950, and has been anthologized in both print and television. It is an example of horror fiction.
Plot summary.
The principal protagonist of "The Boy Who Predicted Earthquakes" is a fifteen-year-old boy, Herbert Bittman. Herbie has a youthful fascination with astronomy but is otherwise presented as being a normal child. Shortly before the opening scenes of the story, however, he has begun to enjoy psychic skills in the area of precognition. Armed with this ability, producers have put together a reality TV show in which Herbie is photographed speaking directly to the camera and making predictions about random events, such as earthquakes, that Herbie asserts will happen in the near future. As these predictions have invariably come true, Herbie and the television show have become wildly successful.
Despite this acclaim, one day Herbie refuses to allow himself to be photographed or broadcast. Without giving any reason, he flatly refuses to perform his usual role. After intense and cruel psychological pressure, he is forced to give in; the force placed on Herbie to perform on camera serves its purpose in increasing the atmosphere of fear and horror surrounding this story. Despite this pressure and his own refusal, when Herbie is broadcast making his weekly predictions of the near future, he astonishes his audience by predicting an immediate, and dramatic, paradigm shift of humanity from the familiar, ugly conditions of everyday life into worldwide utopia. Greed and hatred will disappear; and the resources wasted on competition, and worldwide preparations for war, will instead be spent for the plentiful enjoyment of all. 
Herbie's broadcast generates a sensational global response, as his predictions are rebroadcast around the world and millions of viewers have become convinced that he can accurately read the future. The boy and an unnamed narrator, pursued by ecstatic fans, are forced to take refuge in a skyscraper hotel located near the broadcasting studio. The rejoicing crowds cheer Herbie from far below; close to the top of the building, all he and the narrator can see are sun and sky. 
In the story's climactic scene, the narrator asks Herbie why he had been extremely reluctant to issue his prediction for that week. The boy responds with a confession that, although up until this point his precognitions had been accurate, this one would not be; he had deliberately lied to his television audience. With mounting dread, the narrator realizes that Herbie had, in fact, looked into the future of the coming days and seen something else, which he had not wanted to describe or share. In pressure similar to that placed on Herbie by the television producers, the narrator demands to know what it is. 
Herbie reports that he has seen a scene enacted in the near future which he could not understand until his childhood research in astronomy has explained it to him: he has learned about something called a "nova." What he has really seen, and had not wanted to tell his audience, was that "tomorrow – the sun is going to explode."
Critical response.
The scenes of mass popular rejoicing that mark the conclusion of "The Boy Who Predicted Earthquakes", juxtaposed with the story's dire reality, parallel scenes actually enacted in 1945 when crowds welcomed the end of World War II, only to find that they had been thrust into the atomic age and the Cold War. 
"The Boy Who Predicted Earthquakes" was originally published, in 1950, in "Maclean's" magazine. It was picked up by Rod Serling's NBC anthology series, "Night Gallery"; a teleplay based on the story was broadcast on September 15, 1971, as part of "Night Gallery"'s second season premiere. The teleplay was directed by John Badham, and Herbie's role was performed by Clint Howard.
Astronomy.
Author St. Clair appears to have confused a nova event with a supernova event; the two events were not clearly distinguished from each other by astronomers until 1931. Research subsequent to 1950 indicates that the Sun, a type G2 star, is not likely to turn into either a nova or a supernova.

Festuca gigantea

Festuca gigantea, or giant fescue, is a plant species in the Poaceae (grass family). Because this and other members of "Festuca" subgenus "Schedonorus" have more in common morphologically with members of the genus "Lolium" than with "Festuca" and often produce fertile hybrids with other "Lolium" species, "Festuca gigantea" has been recently published as Lolium giganteum and then as Schedonorus giganteus . Sources vary as to which placement is more acceptable.
Description.
This grass can grow up to 2 metres. It is loosely tufted, hairless, and has auricles. It has dark read leaf nodes. There are 6 8 to 13 mm long spikelets have long awns, the flowers forming in July to August.

Milo Greene (album)

Milo Greene is the debut studio album by Los Angeles-based band Milo Greene. It was released on July 17, 2012 and peaked at number 1 on the US "Billboard" Heatseekers Albums and number 115 on the "Billboard" 200 albums chart.
Background and recording.
The band recorded "Milo Greene" in California and at Bear Creek Studios in Seattle. The lead vocals, guitars, bass, and banjo parts were shared by band members Robbie Arnett, Marlana Sheetz, Andrew Heringer and Graham Fink. The group's fifth member, Curtis Marrero, played drums. Album closer "Autumn Tree" was the first song the band wrote. Arnett explained that at the time, "we were still in our other bands, and Andrew was living up in Sacramento, and I was in L.A., and I had sent him some lyrics, and said 'why don’t we try to experiment. I'll send you lyrics, and see if you can put some melodies over it.' He sent that back, so we started going back and forth with melodies, and that’s kind of how that one happened." Fink noted that creating songs for the album was "definitely a collaborative process" in which any number of band members would start an idea for a given song. Several brief interludes and instrumentals were included on the album, Arnett said, "because we wanted it to flow together like a film." One of these tracks, "Moddison", was named after a Sacramento street where Heringer lived. A music video for lead single "1957", also named after an address, premiered in advance of the album's July 2012 release.
Critical reception.
Allmusic's Matt Collar likened Sheetz's voice to "Sarah McLachlan fronting Fleetwood Mac" and described the album as "a languid, evocative exercise in harmony-infused pop." Megan Ritt of Consequence of Sound called "Milo Greene" "a gorgeously arranged and executed album", but noted that "the overall formula itself gets repetitive after a few listens." "Filter"'s Daniel Kohn said that the album "has a familiar '70s Laurel Canyon–esque vibe that fits nicely in the Los Angeles indie-folk scene." Ron Harris of the Associated Press described it as "a tapestry of richly reverbed guitar, inventive drum work and something sorely missing amid today’s morass of arrange-by-numbers rock music". Chuck Campbell of "Knoxville News Sentinel" wrote that the album, while "often intoxicating", has "an icky, overly sweet taste that sours the enjoyment ... especially as the release gets stuck in fuzzy redundancy."
Uses in other media.
The track "Don't You Give Up On Me" was featured in the tv series Grey's Anatomy in the episode "Let the Bad Times Roll" (Season 8, episode 22) when Lexie tells Mark she loves him. And also in the tv series "Reign" in the episode "A Chill In The Air" (season 1, episode 5) when Francis asks Mary to the harvest festival.
The track "What's the Matter" was featured in the tv series "Supernatural" in the episode "Bitten" (Season 8, episode 4) and was played five times throughout the show, most notably at the beginning and the ending.
The track "Perfectly Aligned" was featured on the season 3 premiere episode of The CW's action-thriller tv series "Nikita".
The track "Autumn Tree" was featured in the film Fun Size, which stars Nickelodeon star Victoria Justice.
The track "1957" was featured in the episode "Stray Dogs" of ABC's tv series Suburgatory.

Beat of the Mesozoic

Beat of the Mesozoic is the second EP by the American Avant-rock band Birdsongs of the Mesozoic, released in 1985 through Ace of Hearts Records.
Release and reception.
Brian Olewnick of Allmusic gave the album two out of five stars, saying that parts of the record "come across as affected and bland" and sometimes "a bit overwrought." However, he gave good mention to the track "The Beat of the Mesozoic, part I", concluding that at their best the band is "able to generate an infectious power and percussive drive that makes one wish for further explorations along that particular road."
Never being individually issued on Compact Disc, only some of "Beat of the Mesozoic" had been included on compilations such as "Sonic Geology" and "The Fossil Record". Finally, the entire release was issued by Cuneiform Records on "Dawn of the Cycads", a two-disc anthology including most of the band's early work.

Transit of Venus (album)

Transit of Venus is the fourth studio album by Canadian rock band Three Days Grace. It was released on October 2, 2012 through RCA Records. The album is the band's first to be released under the record label, following the folding of their former label, Jive Records, in 2011. The album was produced by Don Gilmore and recorded at Revolution Studios in Toronto.
On June 5, 2012, the same day as Venus' visible transit across the sun, the band released the album title and release date. The album spawned three singles ("Chalk Outline", "The High Road" and "Misery Loves My Company"). It is the last of the band's albums to feature former lead singer Adam Gontier. The album debuted at No. 5 on the "Billboard" 200.
Transit of Venus was nominated for Best Rock Album at the Juno Awards of 2014.
Background and recording.
"We went for a tighter, more articulated sound on this record", said Neil Sanderson, the drummer of the band. "The music we were writing was a little more intricate than in the past, and we've been experimenting with new instruments. We wanted to present these new ideas concisely without going over-the-top in ambience and overall production." On August 1, 2012, the band announced that they have finished the recording process of the album, saying in a Facebook post: "Going out on a limb here but I think this record...is actually...finished...wow...what a great journey...thanks to Don Gilmore." The album was made available to stream online on September 27, 2012.
"Chalk Outline" is the first single of the album and was released on August 14, 2012. It was released with a lyric video. Loudwire gave the song a 4/5 rating, saying that "Adam Gontier attacks the track with as much angst and aggression as ever." Eviqshed.com gave the single 5/5, praising the fact the band took a different direction musically. The lyric video to the song was published on YouTube on Three Days Grace's Vevo account on August 13 and the official music video was published on October 5.
Reception.
Critical reception.
Upon its release, the album was met with generally favourable reviews by mainstream music critics, citing the band's different musical direction. Loudwire gave the album a 4 out of 5, saying that "Three Days Grace has stepped out of their comfort zone, ditched the formula, and went all in, holding nothing back in the true spirit of rock." Another positive review came from Artistdirect, which said that "Three Days Grace have undeniably progressed here, and the results are nothing short of incredible." Johan Wippsson of Melodic.net wrote that in "Transit of Venus" "there's an aggressive undertone, which sets a perfect alternative touch on the album."
Allmusic calls the album "refined". An article by music journalist Clayton Petras in Inspirer Magazine gave the album a positive review, mentioning that although the album "opens with some eerie notes and a crooning Adam Gontier that we’re not quite used to", it goes on to mention that the album settles into "the gruff, rugged sound we’ve come to expect from the band".
Chart performance.
The album debuted at No. 5 on the "Billboard" 200, selling 48,000 copies in the U.S. in its first week, two positions behind the band's previous album "Life Starts Now", but the same position as "One-X". "Transit of Venus" also featured at No. 1 on U.S. "Billboard" Top Hard Rock Albums, No. 3 on both the U.S. "Billboard" Top Rock Albums and U.S. "Billboard" Top Alternative Albums, and at No. 4 on both U.S. "Billboard" Top Digital Albums and on the Canadian Albums Chart. On Loudwire, the song "Chalk Outline" won the website's Rock Song of the Year award for 2012. The song topped the U.S. "Billboard" Mainstream Rock Tracks charts debuting at No. 1 and remaining in this position for 13 consecutive weeks, before dropping to No. 3 on its seventeenth week on the chart. The song also reached No. 1 on the Active Rock Radio chart, and remained in this position for eleven weeks. This makes "Chalk Outline" the ninth Three Days Grace song to top Active Rock Radio. "Chalk Outline" also peaked at No. 6 on the U.S. "Billboard" Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles, 
No. 7 on the U.S. "Billboard" Rock Songs, No. 15 on the U.S. "Billboard" Alternative Songs Chart, and No. 65 on the Canadian Hot 100.

<doc id="36554115" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36554115" title="2012 UFL season">
2012 UFL season

The 2012 UFL season was the fourth season of the United Football League. Four teams began what was originally scheduled to be an eight-game schedule beginning September 26, 2012. The league ceased operations on October 20, 2012, after four weeks, extensive financial problems and dismal attendance figures. At the time of the cessation, the Las Vegas Locomotives had compiled a perfect season to date, thus by default giving them their third UFL Championship. 
The league originally stated it would resume the season some time in spring 2013, but the majority of two teams' players filed legal action against the league that winter to claim unpaid salaries, and the league did not set up the necessary agreements to continue by the time spring 2013 had come along.
Offseason developments.
The league, which had coerced the resignation of commissioner Michael Huyghue after the 2011 season, had closed all of its offices and remained completely silent throughout most of winter, spring and early summer 2012, raising doubt about a potential 2012 season or even if the league, which has suffered heavy financial losses throughout its existence, would continue at all. League management will rest with two of its owners, Bill Mayer and William Hambrecht, while football operations will be handled by Las Vegas team president, head coach and general manager Jim Fassel.
For the first time in league history, there was no expansion, contraction, or relocation of any UFL franchises, with all four teams and markets returning from the previous season. The Hartford Colonials, which had been officially "suspended" prior to the 2011 season, did not return and were removed from the league's Web site.
On September 5, 2012, an anonymous source tipped "The Virginian-Pilot" that the start of the 2012 season, originally slated for September 19 on the schedule released July 26, would be delayed one week. The league confirmed the news the next day, also indicating that the championship game would be delayed two weeks instead of one. Difficulties in securing workman's compensation insurance prompted the delay. Players began reporting for training camp the week of September 17, with the abbreviated camps running through the following weekend.
By kicking off for its fourth season, the UFL achieved a feat not matched since the American Football League by lasting more than three seasons as a fully professional league. By Week 2, the league began experiencing severe financial shortfalls, sparked in part by drastically reduced attendances at all three stadiums at which the league had played to that point (the Locomotives' Week 2 attendance at kickoff was only 601 fans), as well as the UFL's continued, systemic delays in payment stemming back to at least the 2010 season. The delayed payments (players were only paid $1,000 of the $7,000 owed to them after their first two games) prompted rumors of possible strike action or walkouts from the league's players beginning in Week 3. One agent who represented three UFL players went so far as to recommend that his clients not practice or play lest they risk injury. Virginia Destroyers owner and UFL president Bill Mayer and Sacramento owner Paul Pelosi in a joint on-air interview with CBS Sports Network on October 5, confirmed that the UFL had indeed not yet issued game checks to its players for 2012, but promised that the league would fulfill its wage obligations to its players and coaches. The Destroyers players again threatened to not play the week 4 contest without a personal guarantee of payment, which the ownership had not yet offered, and that the team's earlier promise of a payment by October 31 would not be sufficient. After the week 4 contests were held, and attendance continued to get even worse (the Virginia Destroyers' Week 4 home game was so poorly attended that the league refused to release an attendance total), the league suspended operations and arranged to pay for all of its players to return to their homes. As of November 3, 2012, the UFL still had not paid the players for their time; several players set a deadline for November 8 before pursuing legal action against the league.
Postseason litigation.
On January 16, 2013, a coalition of approximately 70 players from the Nighthawks and Locomotives served papers to league owner William Hambrecht in order to file a class-action lawsuit to claim their pay. The Destroyers players also have not received any additional pay apart from the $1,000 they received during the season; player liaison Chris Greisen lost contact with Destroyers owner Bill Mayer shortly after the season ended. The Mountain Lions' players have been paid in full for their work. Hambrecht later demanded that the lawsuit be thrown out on a contract technicality that stated all pay disputes be resolved through a committee that, according to the players' attorney, does not even exist. A hearing on the lawsuit was scheduled for June 2013, at which point a Nevada judge turned the case over to a third-party arbiter. As of January 2014, no hearing has been scheduled.
A separate lawsuit involves four assistant coaches of the Las Vegas Locomotives, who are also suing for unpaid salary. That lawsuit was also filed in January and is being handled by the same attorneys.
Yet another lawsuit was filed in July 2013, this one against Paul Pelosi. The five litigants in that case include former Mountain Lions defensive coordinator Chuck Bresnahan, who says he was not paid $250,000.
Rule changes for 2012.
Prior to the season, the UFL made two notable on-field rule changes: The league expanded each team's roster from 50 to 54 players, 4 of which are designated as "practice squad" players. The league also moved its kickoffs back up from the 30-yard-line to the 35-yard-line, consistent with changes made by the NFL (in 2011) and NCAA (also in 2012).
Stadium changes.
The Sacramento Mountain Lions, on August 6, announced that they would be moving to Raley Field, a baseball park in West Sacramento, California. The Mountain Lions, 2011's attendance leader, played their previous two seasons at Hornet Stadium in Sacramento but chose not to extend their two-year lease on that stadium.
The Virginia Destroyers returned to the Virginia Beach Sportsplex while the Omaha Nighthawks again played in TD Ameritrade Park. The Las Vegas Locomotives (which had previously contemplated a move to Salt Lake City, Utah) remained in Las Vegas despite poor attendance for its lone home game in 2011; the team ultimately played its two home games at UNLV's Sam Boyd Stadium in Whitney after discussion and negotiations with Cashman Field, a Triple-A baseball stadium currently home to the Las Vegas 51's. Only after the Locos paid back rent from the 2011 season did Sam Boyd Stadium agree to host the team for the 2012 season, but only for the first two games.
Media changes.
In 2011, the UFL lacked national exposure for its games after two-year deals with Versus and HDNet expired, with the league relying instead on limited regional TV coverage. On July 26, 2012, the league announced a broadcast deal with CBS Sports Network that would see the network carry all of the league's games in 2012. Though the deal with CBSSN returned the UFL to national TV exposure (albeit generally on less widely distributed premium cable and satellite tiers than the regional sports networks that the UFL had utilized in 2011), the league received no rights fee from the network and in fact paid the network upfront for production costs (roughly $150,000 per telecast). An additional caveat of the CBSSN deal prevented live games from being simulcast online, in contrast to the previous three seasons where all televised games had been carried on the Internet (the league's Webmaster had left the league after 2011 as well, which may have also been a factor in the discontinuation of both the Webcasts and the league's centralized Web site).
Local radio broadcasts were abandoned in Virginia and Las Vegas for 2012; radio deals for Omaha and Sacramento continued, however, with Nighthawks games airing on KOZN and the Mountain Lions being split between KHTK and KTKZ.
Schedule.
The eight-week 2012 UFL schedule (4 home and away games for each team) was originally announced on August 1, 2012. Due to the above mentioned delay, the league released a revised schedule (shown below) on September 6, essentially moving the original Week 1 games, which would have been played on September 19 and 21, to the end of the schedule (November 14 and 16). The Championship Game, which was originally scheduled for November 16, was also moved to December 1, skipping over the crowded Thanksgiving rivalry weekend (which the UFL had not done in 2009 or 2010) and allowing teams to have a two-week break between the end of the regular season and the title game, which would have been a first for the UFL. Two other firsts were also included in the schedule: no bye weeks were scheduled during the regular season, and each team was given an unbalanced schedule (3 games with two teams and 2 games with the third team).
Because of the suspension of the season on October 20, 2012, no games were played beyond that date. As of that date, each team had played every other team once and one team twice, with two home games and two away games. The October 17 game between the Locomotives and the Nighthawks would end up serving as the "de facto" UFL Championship Game for the 2012 season; had the Nighthawks won that game, they would have tied for the league's best record with Las Vegas.
Had the season continued as scheduled, the remaining games would have been played as follows:
The 2012 UFL Championship Game would have been played on December 1 at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time. No venue had been chosen for the game at the time of the cessation.
Attendance figures are based on gate draw, not ticket sales. The Locomotives sold 5,277 tickets for their Week 1 game and 3,500 for Week 2.

Bole (mythology)

Bole (Po-le; ) or Bo Le (Po Le) was a horse tamer in Spring and Autumn period, and the honorific name of Sun Yang (), who was a retainer of Duke Mu of Qin (r. 659-621 BCE) and a famous judge of horses. Bole was the legendary inventor of equine physiognomy ("judging a horse's qualities from appearance").
Names.
Sun Yang, with the Chinese surname "Sun" 孫 and given name "Yang" 陽 (of Yin and yang), was renowned for his extraordinary understanding of horses. Sun Yang was given the Chinese honorific name Bole, and is also known Sun Bole (Henry 1987:28).
Bole–literally meaning "Earl of Happy" with "bo" 伯 "uncle; eldest brother; earl" and "le" 樂 "pleasure; happy"–was a mythological figure who first tamed horses. Bole's name was given to a star, from which he supervised the winged "tianma" "heavenly horses". Proposed locations of this Chinese star Bole are with Zaofu 造父 (the legendary charioteer, see below) in Zeta Cephei within Cepheus (Chinese astronomy) ("Book of Jin", Spring 1988:198), or in the constellation Scorpius (Chinese astronomy) (Harrist 1997:135-6).
In Modern Standard Chinese, "Bole" figuratively means "good judge of (especially hidden) talent", from the "chengyu" idiom "Bolexiangma" (). The Classical Chinese expression (from the "Zhanguo Ce" below) "Bole yigu" () means "to instantly raise the ask price of something".
The name Bole has the alternate spellings of Boleh, Bai Le, Bai Lo, Po-le, Pai-lo, Po Lo and Po Lâo.
Historical context.
"Although his fame exceeded that of all others, Bole was only one of many horse experts active during the late Bronze Age" (Harrist 1997:136). Owing to the importance of horse warfare in ancient China, equestrian experts were highly valued. The "Lüshi Chunqiu" listed ten specialized horse physiognomers, and Herrlee Glessner Creel (1965:654) said the "judging of horses was early recognized as a special art".
During the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600-1046 BCE), Chinese armies first battled Eurasian nomadic warriors on horseback. As Creel (1965:670) explained, "The riding horse was forced upon the Chinese. It was first thrust upon their attention as a new and deadly weapon that their nomadic enemies had acquired, and it seems always to have been regarded primarily as an instrument for fighting the nomads." The earliest archaeologically discovered Chinese chariot dated circa 1200 BCE during the reign of King Wu Ding (Shaughnessy 1998). During the Zhou Dynasty (1046-256 BCE), horse-drawn chariots were increasingly used both for warfare and aristocratic transportation. The first clear evidence of horse riding in China comes from the late 4th century BCE (Goodrich 1984). King Wuling of Zhao (r. 325-298 BCE) initiated the military reform of "hufu qishe" 胡服騎射 "barbarian clothing belted pants and horse archery", which replaced chariot tactics with superior cavalry tactics. 
When the Chinese imported military horses and chariots from foreign "horse riders", they concurrently introduced a complex equestrian culture, which resulted in new professions in fields such as horse domestication, selective horse breeding (as early as the 14th century BCE, Creel 1965:654), horse training, horse riding, horse tack, horse care, veterinary medicine, and horse shamanism. 
The Chinese have traditionally believed the best horses and horse specialists came from foreign sources. While some individuals became outstanding equestrians, for Chinese people in general, Creel (1965:670) says, "the riding horse remained something strange, almost foreign in nature. Horses, and horsemen, were in general associated with the border areas of the north and west. It is a striking fact that the grooms and handlers of horses appearing in Chinese art seem almost always to be depicted as non-Chinese."
Horse physiognomy.
Techniques from the Chinese pseudoscience of "xiangshu" 相術 "human physiognomy; judgment of character from facial appearance" were extended to "xiangma" 相馬 "horse physiognomy; evaluating a horse by its appearance". ("Sōma" 相馬 is a common Japanese name.) Bole was specifically a "xiangmashi" 相馬師 "horse physiognomist", which Robert E. Harrist (1988:136) explains: "By studying the body of a horse, giving special attention to its bone structure and the sizes and shapes of its various parts, Bole was able to assess with unfailing accuracy hidden capacities that a lesser judge of horses would have overlooked."
In 1973, archeologists excavating a 168 BCE tomb in Changsha discovered the Mawangdui Silk Texts. They included a fragmentary text about judging horses, which scholars tentatively call the "Xiangmajing" 相馬經 "Classic of Horse Physiognomy" (also used for a 5th-century text). This manuscript mentions Bole himself (tr. Harrist 1997:137); "What Bole physiognomized were the horses of a superior man. "Yin" and "yang" abided by the plumb line, and curved and straight were exactly even."
The (c. 544) "Qimin yaoshu" "Essential techniques for the common people" records early Chinese methods of agriculture and animal husbandry, including horse physiognomy. This text metaphorically associates parts of a horse's body with the political organization of a state, and describes the appearance of an ideal horse.
A horse's head is king; it should be square. The eyes are the prime ministers; they should be radiant. The spine is the general; it should be strong. The belly and chest are the city walls; they should be extended. The four legs are the local officials; they should be long. … In judging a horse one begins with the head. The head should be high and erect; it should look as if it were shaved. The head should be heavy, and it is good that there be little flesh, like the skinned head of a rabbit. (56, tr. Harrist 1997:138-9) 
The Chinese historically used bronze scale models of horses as hippology reference guides to the ideal horse (Harrist 1997:149-150). The "Book of the Later Han" records two early examples. The horse expert Dongmeng Jing presented Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141-87 BCE) with a cast-bronze horse and written instructions for using the model to judge horses. General Ma Yuan (a renowned equestrian surnamed "horse") presented Emperor Guangwu of Han (r. 25-57 CE) a bronze model of a horse designed to clarify the points to observe in equine judging. The inscription, which listed four generations of Ma's horse teachers, said (tr. Creel 1965:659), "Horses are the foundation of military might, the great resource of the state." Some Chinese scholars propose that the famous "Flying Horse" discovered in a Han tomb in Gansu was a physiognomic model for a superior horse in motion.
Giambattista della Porta's (1586) "De humana physiognomonia" was an early Western parallel for horse physiognomy.
Early textual references.
Beginning around the 3rd century BCE, Chinese classics mention Bole as an exemplar of horse judging. Bole is frequently associated with the fabled "qianlima" 千里馬 "thousand-"li" horse", which was supposedly able to gallop one thousand "li" (approximately 400 km) in a single day (e.g., Red Hare). "Qianlima" was a literary Chinese word for people with latent talent and ability; and Spring (1988:180) suggests, "For centuries of Chinese history, horses had been considered animals capable of performing feats requiring exceptional strength and endurance. Possibly it is for this reason that from early times horses have been used allegorically to represent extraordinary people." Bole recognizing a "qianlima" was a metaphor for a wise ruler selecting talented "shi" "scholar-officials". Thus, (Henry 1987:28) "Geniuses in obscurity were called thousand "li" horses who had not yet met their ".
Lüshi Chunqiu.
The (c. 239 BCE) encyclopedic "Lüshi Chunqiu" contrasts Bole with other legendarily-skilled exemplars: the Spring and Autumn period (771-476 BCE) archer Yang Youji 養由基 and swordsmith Ouye, and the charioteer Zaofu who served King Mu of Zhou (r. 976-922 BCE).
When Yang Youji shot at a rhinoceros, he hit a stone instead and the arrow was swallowed, feathers and all. This happened because he was so intent on the rhinoceros. When Bole studied the physiognomy of horses, he saw nothing except horses. This was because he was so intent on horses. (9, tr. Knoblock and Riegel 2000:220) 
Obtaining ten good horses is not as good as obtaining one excellent physiognomist of horses, like Bole, nor ten fine swords as good as one excellent smith, like Ouye, nor a thousand "li" of land as good as one sage. (24, tr. Knoblock and Riegel 2000:609) 
As for a horse, if Bole physiognomized its quality and Zaofu held the reins, a worthy ruler riding as a passenger in a carriage drawn by it could go a thousand "li" in a single day. That such a ruler would expend none of the effort of the physiognomist and driver and yet enjoy the efficaciousness of the horse would be because he knows the principle of being a passenger. (24, tr. Knoblock and Riegel 2000:633) 
Another "Lüshi Chunqiu" chapter lists ten specialist horse physiognomers.
Of those in antiquity who expertly physiognomized horses, Hanfeng Shi [寒風是] examined the teeth; Ma Chao [麻朝], the forehead; Zinu Li [子女厲], the eyes; Wey Ji [衛忌], the whiskers; Xu Bi [許鄙], the rump; Toufa He [投伐褐], the chest; Guan Qing [,管青] the lips and throat; Chen Pei [陳悲] the legs and hooves; Qin Ya [秦牙], the front; and Zan Jun [贊君], the rear. All ten of these men were the most skilled of their age. How they examined horses was not the same, but each looked for characteristics that confirmed a horse's qualities. From this they could know whether the horse had superior or inferior joints, whether it would be clumsy or fleet of foot, whether it was made of sturdy or inferior stuff, and whether it was highly talented or not. It is not only the judging of horses that is like this. There are also confirming characteristics for people, as well as for deeds and states. (20, tr. Knoblock and Riegel 2000:543) 
Hanfeizi.
The (c. 3rd century BCE) Legalist classic "Hanfeizi" has two stories about Bole teaching horse physiognomy. 
Pai-lo once taught two men how to select horses that kick habitually. Later, he went with them to Viscount Chien's stable to inspect the horses. One of the men pulled out a kicking horse. The other man went near behind the horse and patted its flank three times, but the horse never kicked. Therefore, the man who had pulled out the horse thought he had been wrong in the way of selection. Yet the other man said: "You were not wrong in the way of selection. The shoulders of this horse are short but its laps are swollen. The horse that kicks habitually has to raise the hindlegs and lay its whole weight upon the forelegs. Yet swollen laps are not dependable. So the hind legs cannot be raised. You were skilful in selecting kicking horses but not in observing the swollen laps." Verily, everything has the supporter of its weight. However, that the forelegs have swollen laps and therefore cannot support its whole weight, is known only by intelligent men. … Pai-lo taught men whom he disliked how to select swift race-horses and taught men whom he liked how to select inferior horses, because swift race-horses being few and far between would yield slow profits while inferior horses being sold every day would bring about quick profits. (8, tr. Liao 1939:244-6)
Zhanguo ce.
The (c. 3rd-1st centuries BCE) "Zhanguo ce" "Strategies of the Warring States" has two historical stories about Bole in which a courtier seeking an audience with a ruler compares himself to an excellent horse.
After waiting three months for an interview with Lord Chunshen 春申君 (d. 238 BCE), the Prime Minister of Chu, Han Ming 汗明 told a story equating himself to a "ji" 驥 "thoroughbred horse; virtuous person" being recognized by Bole. The (c. 121 CE) "Shuowen Jiezi" dictionary defined "ji" 驥 (tr. Spring 1988:188) as: "a thousand "li" horse that needs a Sun Yang (i.e., Po-le) to be recognized."
You have heard of the great stallion Chi, have you not?' asked Han Ming. When Chi was very old, he was harnessed to a salt cart to pull it up Mount Taihang, His hooves grew weak and his haunches trembled, his tail was soaked and his flanks drenched till sweat dripped to the ground and mingled with lather from his withers. Midway he came to a halt. He heaved on the shafts but could no longer climb. Po Lo came upon him there and leaping from his chariot he cradled (the horse's head) in his arms and wept. He took off his cape and covered the beast with it. Then Chi lowered his head and snorted, raised it and neighed with a sound that carried to the heavens—a sound as pure as chiming stones. And why? Because he saw that Po Lo truly knew him as he was. (38, tr. Crump 1979:273-4) 
Su Dai 蘇代 (a brother of Su Qin) from Yan wanted an audience with the King of Qi and requested Chunyu Kun 淳於髡, master of the Jixia Academy, to be an intermediary.
Once there was a merchant who was selling a very fine horse. For three whole days together he stood in the market place and no one paid him the least attention. Finally he went to Po Lo and said, "I have a superior beast I wish to sell, but I have stood in the market place for three whole days and no one has even remarked on the horse. I beg you, sir, to come and look him up and down, and when you leave, keep glancing back at him. For this I would like to give you a sum equal to my expenses for one day's market." Po Lo did look the horse over carefully, and as he left he glanced back at it. In a single morning offers for the horse increased ten-fold. Now I want to "show a splendid steed" to the king and I have no one to introduce me. Would you be willing to be my Po Lo? I would like to make you a gift of a pair of white "pi" and a thousand measures of gold to defray the expenses of your horses' fodder. (70, tr. Crump 1979:514) 
The horse allegorizing Su Dai is called a "junma" 駿馬 "excellent horse; splendid steed", and Spring (1988:185) says Bole, "because of his ability to recognize merit, functions as a mediator."
Zhuangzi.
Unlike most classical texts that praise Bole for skill in evaluating horses, the (c. 3rd century BCE) Daoist "Horses' Hooves" chapter of "Zhuangzi" blames him for going against the Dao of horses.
A horse's hooves can tread upon frost and snow, its hair can withstand the wind and the cold. It eats grass and drinks water; it prances about briskly. This is a horse's true nature. Though one might provide a horse with magnificent terraces and splendid bedrooms, they are of no use to it. But then came Poleh, who said, "I am skilled at training horses." And men began to singe them, clip their hair, trim their hooves, and brand them. They led them with bridles and hobbles, lined them up in stable and stall, resulting in the deaths of two or three out of ten. They made the horses go hungry and thirsty, raced them, and galloped them, arrayed them in rows and columns. In front were the tribulations of the bit and the ornamental halter, behind were the threats of the whip and the crop, resulting in the deaths of over half the horses. … Returning to the subject of horses, if they are allowed to live on the open land, they eat the grass and drink the water. When they are happy, they cross necks and rub against each other. When they are angry, they turn back to back and kick each other. The knowledge of horses amounts to this and no more. But you put a yoke upon them and array them evenly with moon-mirrors on their foreheads, all they know is to try to break the cross-bar, twist out of the yoke, smash the chariot cover, expel the bit, and bite through the reins. Therefore, to take the knowledge of a horse and make it behave like a brigand is the crime of Poleh. (tr. Mair 80-82)
Huainanzi.
The (c. 139 BCE) eclectic compilation "Huainanzi" refers to Bole in four contexts, three of which are similar to the "Lüshi Chunqiu". The first one (2, tr. Major et al. 2010:94) mentions him with the charioteer Zaofu: "Zaofu could not be Bo Le. Each had articulated a single corner but did not comprehend the full domain of the myriad techniques." The second (9, tr. Major et al. 2010:324) mentions another famous charioteer Wang Liang 王良: "Thus is Bo Le selects the steeds and Wang Liang drives them, and enlightened ruler can ride without the trouble of selecting horses or driving and can undertake a journey of a thousand "li". He is carried by the capabilities of others as if they were his feathers and wings." The third context (11, tr. Major et al. 2010:414, 416) lists the swordsmith Ouye with three above horse physiognomers: "Thus it is said, 'Obtaining ten sharp swords is not as good as attaining the skill of Ou Ye; obtaining one hundred fleet horses is not as good as attaining the arts of Bo Le … The assessment methods of Bo Le, Han Feng, Qin Ya, and Guan Qing were all different, but their understanding of horses was as one."
The final "Huainanzi" context is a well-known story about Duke Mu of Qin, Bole, Bole's sons, and Jiufang Gao 九方皋.
Duke Mu of Qin addressed Bo Le saying: "You are getting on in years. Is anyone in your family who can take over for you and find me a good steed?" Bo Le replied; "A good horse may be judged by his physique, countenance, sinews, and bones. But in judging the best horse in the world, it seems as if it is not there at all, as if it has disappeared, as if it had lost its singular identity. A horse like that raises no dust and leaves no tracks. All my sons are lesser talents. They can judge a good horse, but they lack the talent to judge the best horse in the world. However, there is a man who is my porter and firewood gatherer who is called Nine-Cornered Hillock. In judging horses, he is not inferior to my abilities. I respectfully request that you grant him an audience."
Duke Mu granted him an audience and commanded him to search out a fine steed. After three months Nine-Cornered Hillock returned and reported: "The horse has been located. It is in Shaqiu." Duke Mu replied: "What kind of horse is it?" "It is a yellow mare," answered Nine-Cornered Hillock. Thereupon Duke Mu sent men to Shaqiu to obtain the horse. The horse, however, turned out to be a black stallion. Duke Mu was quite displeased. Summoning Bo Le, he inquired of him saying: "What a loss! The man you sent to find me a good steed cannot distinguish the color of one coat from another nor a female from a male, what could he possibly know about horses?" Bo Le let out a long sigh and replied: "It always comes to this! This is precisely why he surpasses me by a thousand or ten thousand fold and is infinite in his capabilities. What Hillock observes is dynamism of Heaven. He recognizes the refined essence and discards the dross. He focuses on the internal and disregards the external. He looks at what is to be seen and does not look at what is not to be seen. He scrutinizes what is to be scrutinized and disregards what is not to be scrutinized. It appears that what he has judged is quality more precious than just a horse." The horse arrived and ultimately proved to be an excellent horse. Therefore the "Laozi" says: "Great straightness is as if bent; great skill is as clumsy." (12, tr. Major et al. 2010:458)
The (c. 3rd-4th century CE) Daoist "Liezi" (tr. Giles 1912:66) repeats this story about Bole recommending Jiufang Gao to Duke Mu. For comparison, "A good horse can be picked out by its general build and appearance. But the superlative horse—one that raises no dust and leaves no tracks—is something evanescent and fleeting, elusive as thin air."
Han Yu.
The Tang dynasty poet Han Yu (768-824) wrote a well-known fable about Bole and "qianlima".
Only when an era has a man like Po-le are there thousand-"li" horses. Thousand-"li" horses are common, but Po-les, on the other hand, are rare. Thus even though there may be famous horses, they only become abused under the hand of the man to whom they are enslaved, and they die in the stables—never having been recognized as thousand-"li" horses. Thousand-"li" horses at times consume a whole "dan" 60 kg of grain in one feeding. If the one who feeds them does so without knowing they are capable of a thousand-"li", then even though they may have the ability to go so far, they, having not eaten their fill, are lacking in strength, and their talent and beauty are not apparent. Moreover, if one wanted to rank them with regular horses, they would not make the grade. How then could they be asked to have the ability of going a thousand "li"? They are whipped inappropriately and fed in such a way that they cannot fulfil their innate talents. Yet when they cry out, they cannot be understood. With whip in hand the man approaches them and says, "There are not any good horses in the empire." Alas! Is it that there are really no good horses or is it perhaps that there is no one who really understands horses? (tr. Spring 1988:187) 
Textual attributions.
The name Bole occurs in titles of various Chinese books on equine medicine – but this does not mean Bole was the author. Imrie et al. (2001:137) explain that, "As was quite often the case in China, rather than revealing their own names, authors would publish their books under the name of famous historical or even legendary figures living centuries if not millennia earlier." 
The oldest recorded books with Bole's name are listed in the (636 CE) "Book of Sui" bibliographic section on veterinary texts. Two are noted as lost after the Liang Dynasty (502-577): "Bole xiangma jing" 伯樂相馬經 "Bole's Classic of Horse Physiognomy" and "Bole liaoma jing" 伯樂療馬經 "Bole's Classic on Treatments for Horses". The third veterinary text was extant during the Sui Dynasty (578-618): "Bole zhima zabing jing" 伯樂治馬雜病經 "Bole’s Classic on Curing the Various Illnesses of Horses".
Chinese legends associate Bole with the origins of veterinary acupuncture for horses, which some Western sources misinterpret as history. For instance (Lin and Panzer 1994:426), "Another famous veterinarian, Sun Yang, alias Baile, wrote "Baile Zhen Jing" (Baile's Canon of Veterinary Acupuncture) at the time of Qin Mu-Gong (659-621 BC)." The (1385) "Simu anji ji" 司牧安驥集 "Horse-herder's Collection of Ways to Pacify Thoroughbreds" cites a called Bo Le zhen jing伯樂針經 "Bole’s Classic of “Needling/Acupuncture”), but this title keyword "zhen" 針 "needle; pin" can ambiguously mean either "needling (to lance boils, etc.)" or "acupuncture." Imrie et al. (2001:137) conclude there is no reason to associate the "Bole zhen jing" with acupuncture because the "Simu anji ji" and other early veterinary texts clearly used "zhen" to mean "cauterization or phlebotomy".

Zeta Equulei

Zeta Equulei (3 Equulei) is a single star located in the small northern constellation of Equuleus. It is faintly visible to the naked eye at an apparent visual magnitude of 5.6. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 4.24 mas, Zeta Equulei is roughly distant from Earth, give or take an 80 light-year margin of error. At that distance, the apparent brightness of the star is diminished by 0.15 in visual magnitude because of extinction from interstellar gas and dust.
Properties.
Zeta Equulei is an evolved giant star with a stellar classification of K5 III. The measured angular diameter of this star, after correction for limb darkening, is . At the estimated distance of Delta Ophiuchi, this yields a physical size of about 63 times the radius of the Sun. It is radiating an estimated 949 times the luminosity of the Sun from this expanded outer envelope at an effective temperature of 3,893 K. At this heat, it shines with the orange-hued glow of a K-type star.

Special Assistance Resource Teacher

The establishment of the "Special Assistance Program" in Victorian Primary Schools was the most significant development in remedial education in Australia. It was a Hamer Liberal Government initiated strategic plan designed to address falling literacy and numeracy standards. The totally new component of the "Special Assistance Program" was the provision of 1000 "Special Assistance Resource Teachers" (SARTs) for the delivery of services to children with learning needs. These designated teachers were also given an on-site school responsibility for facilitating a productive relationship between parents and pupils and teachers. The program involved the training of these primary teachers as SARTs and their placement in schools. Their role was the early detection and remediation of children at risk of illiteracy and innumeracy. The position was the focus of this substantial change in the delivery of special educational services to children at risk of illiteracy and innumeracy. The role incorporated all the elements of services previously performed by external consultants visiting schools. [http://archive.org/stream/AddressingDecliningLiteracyAndNumeracySkillsInVictorianPrimarySchools#page/n0/mode/1up]
The Special Assistance Program.
The development and implementation of the "Special Assistance Program" in Victorian Primary Schools during the period 1979 - 1982 constituted the most significant innovation in the provision of special education services to children experiencing learning difficulties and in addressing declining literacy and numeracy standards.
Up until the political directive to initiate this program was given, there had been no policy within the "Department of Education and Early Childhood Development"[http://www.education.vic.gov.au/] (previously "Education Department of Victoria") directing Principals of Primary Schools to develop special programs for pupils at risk of illiteracy and innumeracy.
In July 1979, the Assistant Minister of Education the Hon. Norman Lacy established a "Ministerial Committee on Special Assistance Programs". The committee consisted of people drawn from school staffs, special education facilities, teacher training institutions and the Education Department administration. The committee's report was the basis upon which the "Special Assistance Program" was established.[http://archive.org/stream/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-MinisterialStatement_912/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-MinisterialStatement#page/n0/mode/1up] The major components recommended for the program were:
The process for the establishment of the "Special Assistance Program" in Victorian Primary Schools was outlined in a speech made by Mr Lacy to SARTs at a seminar on 15 December 1980.[http://archive.org/stream/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-ASpeech_862/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-ASpeech#page/n0/mode/1up]
Special Assistance Resource Teachers.
Concept.
The concept of a school based resource teacher identifying deficits in literacy and numeracy in individual children and providing assistance and resources to classroom teachers to address those deficits through special programs had been supported by the findings of numerous major committees of inquiry. Reports such as:
The educational philosophy that was the foundation upon which the Special Assistance Program was built had its origins in these reports. That philosophy recognises the profound influence that a child's learning environment has on his behaviour and learning. It also acknowledges the right of children to have their learning needs met in common structural and social conditions. Arising from this philosophical perspective emerges the inescapable proposition that special assistance for children at risk of illiteracy and innumeracy (over and above the normnal learning provisions available to all children) is an essential part of a school's functioning and that the designation of a specially trained resource teacher to provide that assistance to children, their classroom teachers and their parents is an integral part of a team approach to curriculum development, teaching and all other aspects of schooling. This position was strongly supported by both the Australian Schools Commission's "Report for the Triennium 1976-78" and the Warnock Report, which went further to assert that if ordinary schools are to improve in their efforts for children with special needs they will require special support from within their organisation.
Functions.
The role and functions of the SARTs were specifically prescribed by the Government after extensive consultation with the Victorian Teachers Union (VTU) and the Victorian Primary Principals Association (VPPA). They were:
Appointment.
The implementation of the first stage of the "Special Assistance Program" was only possible after further consultation and a signed agreement by the Minister of Educational Services the Hon. Norman Lacy with the VTU and the VPPA.
As a result, from the beginning of the 1981 school year SARTs were designated by their schools and appointed to the 575 primary schools with enrolments of greater than 300 pupils. They were manadated to establish the "Special Assistance Program" in their schools. The Education Department's Special Services Division and the Primary Division monitored the progress of the implementation and produced a number of evaluative reports that were presented to the Minister.
From the beginning of the 1982 school year, schools with an enrolment of between 150 and 300 pupils designated and appointed a SART to carry out the role on a half-time basis. This resulted in and additional 302 primary schools in Victoria having a school based resource teacher, bringing the total to 877 schools. It was not planned to designate a SART at schools with less than 150 pupils. At such schools it was planned that the Principal or an appointed staff member would access services from the Special Assistance Resource Centres for children at these schools in need of such services.
In-Service Training Courses for SARTs.
A major component of stage one was the in-service education component for the SARTs designated by their schools for the new role. A survey of the qualifications and experience of the 575 designated SARTs was undertaken to assess their training requirements. The responses indicated that 200 of the designated teachers had already completed special education training courses. Of these 102 were also experienced in special education teaching. As well 28 of the 375 remaining designated teachers were experienced special education teachers.
Four teacher training colleges (Melbourne, Burwood, Bendigo and Warrnambool) were chosen to provide the training programs. A course planning committee was established and drew up a set of principles and a course content outline for a 20-day, one day per week special assistance training course. The course content dealt with approaches to language teaching (esprecially reading), mathematics teaching, and identification of learning problems. The focus of the course was to enable SARTs to devise and implement programs of special assistance in their own schools. An invitation to enrol in the course was sent to all designated SARTs by the Acting Director of Teacher Education on 29 January 1981. They were told that attendance at the courses was voluntary. The responses received by the colleges overwhelmed them. Very few SARTs did not enrol in the course and many teachers from schools of less than 300 pupils were voluntarily designated by their Principals as SARTS and also sought enrolment in the training course. As a result not all requests for the in-service training course in the Special Assistance Program could be met in the first year of its availability. During 1981, 290 SARTs undertook the course.
The response from schools to the in-service training course was way beyond the Education Department's expectations and reflected the extent of expressed and latent concerns schools had for children at risk of illiteracy and innumeracy. A survey of 160 teachers who had completed this course found that, despite initial concerns, there was a good deal of support from school principals and teachers for the SART concept. However, most SARTs felt they needed more in-service training or further training in special education before they felt competent to fulfil their roles. AREA shared a concern that teachers undertaking SART duties were not qualified in special education, but their proposals to the course committee were rejected.

George R. Wicker

George R. Wicker (March 17, 1877 – January 26, 1935) was an American agricultural businessman, agricultural accountant, and lawmaker as a State Representative for Minnesota.
Background and family.
He worked for the Minnesota Department of Agriculture as Commissioner, the Illinois Farm Bureau, the Illinois Department of Agriculture, and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as the Chief of the Investigative Service for the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (Triple A). George R. Wicker was the 1st CEO or Growmark, Inc. in Bloomington, Illinois from 1927-1929, now an $8 billion agricultural business. His parents are John Wicker (born in Germany 1848) & Annie Gilbertson (born in Norway 1859). He married Nora B. Lewison (Born Oct 1880, Died Apr 24, 1962 in Hastings, Dakota, Minnesota) on Jul 10, 1899 in Hayfield, Minnesota. by Rev. John Linnevold, Pastor of Synod Church. George and Nora had three children, Mertyl Geraldine Wicker (born July 7, 1901; died on April 27, 1988 in La Jolla, San Diego, CA), Ruth Wicker (born September 29, 1907; died on August 20, 1983 in Palos Verdes Peninsula, Los Angeles, CA), and George (Kelly) Rollis Wicker (born November 7, 1917)
US military service (Spanish-American War).
While living in Hayfield, Minnesota he enlisted in the United States Army (in St. Paul, Minn) at the age of 21 on June 20, 1898. George R. Wicker was in Company E and wounded in action at Leech Lake on October 5, 1898; discharged on January 4, 1899 at Fort Snelling, Minnesota.
George Wicker and his soon to be brother-in-law Lewis Lewison enlisted for service in the Spanish-American War. The war was short lived ending before George and Lew were deployed into active duty. Federal Marshals requested military assistance from Fort Snelling concerning issues with the Ojibway tribe of American Indians in Northern Minnesota. In response the Minnesota 3rd Infantry was dispatched to Leech Lake in Walker, Minnesota on October 4, 1898.
The conflict is to be known as "The Battle of Sugar Point" and is the last recorded battle between U.S. Army troops and American Indians. The Battle of Sugar Point, or the Battle of Leech Lake, was fought on October 5, 1898 between the 3rd Infantry and members of the Pillager Band of Chippewa Indians in a failed attempt to apprehend Pillager Ojibwe Bugonaygeshig ("Old Bug" or "Hole-In-The-Day"), as the result of a dispute with Indian Service officials on the Leech Lake Reservation in Cass County, Minnesota. Often referred to as "the last Indian Uprising in the United States", the engagement is also the first battle to be fought in the Northwest United States since the Winnebago War in 1827. It is considered by American War Historians to be the last battle fought between Native Americans and the U.S. Army.
The engagement has cost the lives of one officer, Captain Wilkinson and five men. Among the ten that were injured were five Minnesotans, Privates; George R. Wicker, Charles M. Turner, Edward Brown, Jes S. Jensen, and Gottfried Ziegler. 
After the Spanish-American War.
In 1899 George R. Wicker wrote and published ("In the Battle with the Chippewas," which appeared in the "Illustrated Home Journal" of St. Louis on April 1, 1899) his war experience with the American Indians at Sugar Point Minnesota. In his writings he mentions that the American Indians (Red man) was merely rightfully fighting for the land that they (the Chippewas) deserve and have lived on far longer than the white man. George R. Wicker also states that if the tables were turned, the white man would have fought as feverishly as the American Indians have should their land be raped and pillaged by outsiders.
An excerpt from the article reads; 
(From the Minnesota Historical Society) A photostatic copy of an article by George Wicker entitled "In the Battle with the Chippewa," which appeared in the "Illustrated Home Journal" of St. Louis for April 1, 1899, has been received from Miss Lillian Wicker of St. Paul, a sister of the author. Wicker was a member of the expedition that went to Leech Lake in October, 1898, to suppress the Indian uprising of that year, and he here records his experiences, particularly in the battle of October 5. The article was copied from a rare file 1941 ACCESSIONS 89 of the Journal in the possession of the publishers, the Louis Lange Publishing Company of St. Louis.
1900 to 1903.
George Wicker was an editor in Hayfield, Minnesota.
1903 to 1906.
George Wicker was in the State Legislative Staff for the Minnesota Senate (Committee on Taxes and Tax Laws Clerk).
1906 to 1916.
George Wicker became the manager of a lumberyard in Hayfield, Minnesota, and worked with the Minnesota State Senate.
1917 to 1922 Minnesota State Representative.
George Wicker was elected into the Minnesota State Legislature as a State Representative for District 5 and was in the following committees; Education, Elections, Markets and Marketing, Military Affairs, Motor Vehicles, Taxes. Representative George Wicker was instrumental in getting funds allocated for the Minnesota War Records Commission during his term with the legislature. The commission collected information and memorabilia regarding the military and publishing a special report regarding the Battle of Sugar Point in which George R. Wicker participated.
Wicker-Nolan Bill Creating Minnesota Department of State Police.
In 1921, William I. Nolan and George R. Wicker introduced a bill (Wicker-Nolan Bill) to create a State Public Safety Commission to co-ordinate the activities of all public peace and prosecuting officers. The bill passed the Senate 41 to 22. Minnesota Governor J. A. O. Preus supported the bill to create a 100-man Department of State Police to act as peace officers. In a special message to the 1921 Legislature Governor J. A. O. Preus opened the CA's long campaign for a state constabulary. A "terrific" wave of crime was sweeping across the nation, and a state constabulary was the only way to deal with it effectively. CA publications supported Preus's efforts to stomp out the new wave of youthful criminals that was attributed to movies, pool halls, and war experience. Preus supported a bill to create a 100-man Department of State Police to act as peace officers. Despite a clause that the force "shall not be employed in strikes arising out of labor controversies between employers and employees;' the legislature, probably realizing that labor opposition would doom the bill, ignored Preus's effort. Instead William I. Nolan and George Wicker introduced a bill to create a State Public Safety Commission to coordinate the activities of all public peace and prosecuting officers.
Minnesota Cooperative Act of 1919.
George Wicker authored the Minnesota Cooperative Act of 1919. George Wicker testified during the Revenue Act of 1926 Hearings on H.R. 1 Before the Senate Committee on Finance, 69th United States Congress, 1st Sess. (July 1926), 261-274. George R. Wicker was representing the Illinois Agricultural Association, and testifying on behalf of several national and State cooperative and farm organizations.
These laws were originally enacted principally to insure to groups of farmers the right to act collectively without violating state antitrust statutes. Congress assured to cooperatives the same immunity from United States antitrust law by enactment of the Capper-Volstead Act in 1922. Neither state nor federal law grants such immunity to cooperatives in their ordinary commercial transactions and dealings.
1921 to 1924 Minnesota State Department of Agriculture.
In 1921 George Wicker was appointed Deputy Commissioner of the Minnesota State Department of Agriculture.
1924 to 1927 Illinois Agricultural Auditing Association & co-ops.
What is now the Illinois Agricultural Auditing Association was organized as the Illinois Agricultural Cooperative Association. Vernon Vaniman of Virden was hired as fieldman, and George Wicker of Minnesota was hired as Director/manager.
Agricultural accounting. From the "Cornell Daily Sun": "The different forms of organization found in co-operatives have created a demand for a special kind of agricultural accountants. The Agricultural Association of Illinois established a department of business, service to supply this need. This department audits the books of the member companies at regular rates, and helps the co-operatives find the cause of financial losses. George R. Wicker, Manager of the Illinois Agricultural Co-operative Association, spoke on the business management of country grain elevators. Their history was traced from the time when they were organized as corporations principally handling grain, to the present."
1927 to 1929 founding of Growmark, Inc..
George Wicker was the director of the Illinois Agricultural Cooperative Association and outlined a sound financial policy for (Illinois Farm Supply), now Growmark, Inc. covering working capital, extension of credit, and dealers contracts. And so it began. Illinois Farm Supply was created as a wholesale distributor of petroleum and lubricant products. From the beginning, IAA and Farm Supply leaders insisted on clean-cut business practices, top-grade service, and enforceable contracts between Illinois Farm Supply and member cooperatives. In 1927 George R. Wicker was appointed the first CEO of Growmark, Inc. (an agricultural co-op) based in Bloomington, Illinois. Growmark, Inc. is now an $8 billion company.

Robert S. "Bob" Lewis, Jr. (October 6, 1925 – April 11, 2012) was an American college basketball player notable as a starting forward on the University of Utah's 1944 National Championship team.
Lewis was born and grew up in Salt Lake City, the son of a University of Utah professor. He and his twin brother Fred attended East High School and came to their father's university to play basketball for coach Vadal Peterson in the Fall of 1943. Due to the shortage of college-aged men associated with World War II, freshmen were eligible to play varsity basketball (freshmen wouldn't become permanently eligible until 1973). Known as the "Blitz Kids," Lewis joined classmates Arnie Ferrin, Dick Smuin and Herb Wilkinson to become the first champions in NCAA men's basketball history to feature four freshmen in the starting lineup.
Following the championship season, the Lewis twins joined the Army for World War II. After their stint in the military, both Lewises moved to Stanford University to finish their academic careers. Bob Lewis played basketball for Stanford coach Everett Dean and played three years for the Indians. Lewis was noted as a strong defensive player during his time in Palo Alto. In addition to basketball, Lewis was a standout tennis player at Stanford.
Lewis graduated with an engineering degree and went into a career in the aerospace industry.

3-Pyridylnicotinamide

The organic compound 3-pyridylnicotinamide (3-pna), also known as "N"-(pyridin-3-yl)nicotinamide, is a kinked dipodal dipyridine that is synthesized through the reaction of nicotinoyl chloride and 3-aminopyridine. The nitrogen atoms on its pyridine rings, like those of its isomer 4-pyridylnicotinamide, can donate their electron lone pairs to metal cations, allowing it to bridge metal centers and act as a bidentate ligand in coordination polymers. It can be used to synthesize polymers that have potentially useful gas adsorption properties.

George A. McElroy

George Albert McElroy (born 25 May 1922, Houston, Texas, died 7 October 2006) was a prominent pioneering African-American journalist. Among many "firsts" achieved by McElroy, he became the first African American to earn a master's degree in journalism from the University of Missouri.
Early life.
George McElroy was born 25 May 1922 in Houston, Texas to Hugh and Philomena McElroy. His father, Hugh George McElroy was a highly decorated war veteran who fought in the Battle of San Juan Hill against Pancho Villa and who fought alongside General John J. Pershing and President Theodore Roosevelt, and later was awarded the Croix de Guerre for his bravery in service during World War I. 
George McElroy was raised in the Third Ward area of Houston.
Education and fight against segregation.
After he was honorably discharged from service, McElroy returned to his still-segregated home state of Texas. Due to segregation (separate, but equal) laws of the time, he was forced to attended Texas Southern University (then-called Texas State University for Negroes (TSUN)) after being denied admission to the University of Texas (UT). He had applied to the University of Texas following the landmark decision of Sweatt v. Painter. In his letter of denial from UT, he was told that UT and TSUN both offered the courses he was seeking. Being a Negro, according to segregation laws, he had to attend TSUN. He responded to the denial letter from UT stating that although the courses were offered at both universities, there was little else "equal" about the universities. 
McElroy sued for the right to attend UT, but ultimately earned his bachelor's degree in journalism from TSUN in 1956.
McElroy received a scholarship from the Wall Street Journal to attend the University of Missouri. In 1957, he became the first African American to earn a master's degree in journalism from the university.
Journalism career.
In 1937, McElroy landed a job as a youth column writer at the "Informer", the oldest African-American newspaper in Texas. He was paid $3 per column. Throughout his off-and-on 58-year tenure with the newspaper, he functioned in virtually every capacity of running the periodical. He retired in 1996, but served as "Editor Emeritus" until his death in 2006.
After graduation from the University of Missouri, McElroy considered several job offers and accepted a position as a "colored sports" writer for the now-defunct Houston Post daily newspaper in 1954 
and in 1956, he became a weekly columnist. 
He was the first black reporter and the first black columnist at the paper which, at that time, was the largest morning newspaper in Texas. 
In spite of his position as a regular columnist, his likeness in the paper above his column was a black and white sketch of his image as opposed to photos as presented for his white counterparts at the paper.
In response to question to him c. 1970 from a reader of his column, McElroy responded:
"“The world, the nation, the state, the city are all multicolored, as in a rainbow and multiracial. A professional journalist simply cannot afford to reside in a racial-isolation ward. He must travel and he must converse and he must observe and he must be curious."
In 1960, during an annual meeting of the The Houston Press Club, the club presented a skit portraying the year's presidential candidates. (McElroy was the first African American member of the club). Local television reporter Dave Ward portrayed democratic candidate Lyndon Johnson. Performing in whiteface, McElroy portrayed the role of Alabama Gov. George Wallace, a vigilant segregationist, after no one else wanted to portray the independent candidate.
This portrayal made McElroy the first black cast member of the club's annual "Gridiron Show". Picketers lined the streets and the cast members received death threats leading to Houston mayor Louie Welch provided police protection for McElroy for 72 hours.
Also in 1960, thirteen students from Texas Southern, lead by Eldrewey Stearns, held a sit-in at the counter at a Houston area Weingarten store in protest of segregation using a model laid out by experienced sit-in students at Fisk University. In planning how to attract press coverage for the sit-in, they contacted McElroy for input who committed to send a photographer from "The Informer" and advised on calling the police themselves. This tip proved to be instrumental in the protest. Over 100 people eventually participated in the protest which ended peacefully. The Houston television and printed press coverage dubbed the event as the "first sit-in west of the Mississippi."
McElroy also served as the Texas correspondent for Jet Magazine and was elected as President of the Press Club of Houston. Throughout his career as a journalist, McElroy interviewed numerous persons of interest including Martin Luther King, Jr., Fidel Castro, Muhammad Ali, George Foreman and six American presidents.
In a 2000 interview, McElroy stressed the continued need for black press stressing that African Americans are closer to the issues concerning their own community and he credits black press for being first in bringing the effects of crack cocaine into the limelight long before it was deemed an issue in mainstream media. 
""We cover issues that the major dailies don't see or fail to see. We're closer to problems and concerns in our community. We see them first.""
Teaching career.
Simultaneously with his journalism career, McElroy taught journalism in the Houston area for over four decades.
Firsts and honors.
Firsts.
George McElroy was a pioneer for African Americans in the field of journalism. Throughout his life he became the first African American:
McElroy was also the first minority of any race to have a regular column in a Houston newspaper
Honors.
Throughout his life, McElroy received over 100 awards and honors including:
Scholarships.
Several journalism-related scholarships have been named in honor of George McElroy's contributions to journalism, including:
Military service.
From 1940-1943, McElroy served in the Navy during World War II and served in the United States Merchant Marines from 1944 through 1945. From 1951-1952 during the Korean War, he served as an Information Officer
at Ellington Air Force Base where he met his second wife, Lucinda Martin McElroy, who was serving as a Corporal in the US Air Force.
In 1973, McElroy was commissioned by Texas Governor Dolph Briscoe to serve as an admiral in the state's navy. He declined the commission opting to continue his journalism career.
Personal life.
McElroy was first married to the late Maxine Prudhomme. They had one child, Madeline.
His second marriage was to Air Force veteran Lucinda Martin in 1950 with whom he had four more daughters, Toni, Linda, Kathleen and Sherridan. George and Lucinda were married nearly 45 years until her death in 1995.
In 2006, McElroy was hospitalized with respiratory illness. In September 2006, McElroy received word that he would be honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Houston Association of Black Journalists at their 20th Annual Scholarship Gala. Although receiving medical treatment at the time, McElroy received permission from his attending physicians, and attended the event. McElroy received his award and gave his acceptance speech. Shortly after the event, McElroy fell gravely ill with acute pneumonia and died on October 6. His funeral services were held at St. Mary of the Purification Catholic Church and his remains were interred at Houston National Cemetery in Houston, Texas.

Almost Saturday Night

"Almost Saturday Night" is a song written by John Fogerty and first released on his 1975 album "John Fogerty". It was released as a single and reached #78. It was also covered by a number of artists, including Dave Edmunds, who also released it as a single to more success, Gene Clark, Ricky Nelson and The Searchers.
The song describes the hero looking out the window and getting excited about the approaching weekend.
Fogerty released the song as the second single from "John Fogerty", as a follow up to "Rockin' All Over the World, which reached #27. However, "Almost Saturday Night" could only reach #78.
"Almost Saturday Night" had more success when covered in a rockabilly by Dave Edmunds in 1981 from his album "Twangin...". Edmunds' version reached #54 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #18 on Billboard's Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks. Others who have since covered the song include The Searchers on "Play for Today" in 1981, Ricky Nelson on "Playing to Win" in 1981 and "The Memphis Sessions" in 1986 and Gene Clark and Carla Olson on "So Rebellious a Lover" in 1987. The Flying Burrito Brothers covered the song in 1984. Their version peaked at number 49 on the "Billboard" Hot Country Singles chart. A cover by Bob Woodruff peaked at number 89 on the "RPM" Country Tracks chart in Canada in 1997.
Allmusic critic Mark Deming considers "Almost Saturday Night" one of Fogerty's best songs and describes the song as "a gloriously passionate hymn to the promise of the weekend." Deming felt that Fogerty's "gritty" vocals were better suited to the song than Edmunds' "smoother" vocals, but praised Edmunds' enthusiasm and "killer" guitar solo. "Rolling Stone Magazine" critic Dave Marsh praised the song's Beatles-like guitar part and double tracked vocal performance, claiming that it is the only song on "John Fogerty" which breaks the album's "predictable pattern." Others who have described the song as "great" include Allmusic critic William Ruhlmann and author Billy Poore.

Simon Pierre Tchoungui

Simon Pierre Tchoungui (28 October 1916 - July 1997) was a doctor who was appointed Prime Minister of East Cameroon from October 1965 until 20 May 1972, when the United Republic of Cameroon came into being.
Early years.
Simon Pierre Tchoungui was born in Nkolmending, Mefou Division, Center Province of Cameroon on 28 October 1916.
He belonged to the Ewondo / Bulu group collectively known as the Beti people.
He attended the Ayos school for health assistants, founded in 1932 by Eugène Jamot.
After his schooling he worked as a medical assistant in Yaoundé and Mbalmayo.
During World War II he enrolled as a soldier in the Free French Forces from 1942 to 1945.
He then studied at Dakar Medical School, qualifying as a surgeon to 1947, when he returned to Cameroun.
He studied at the University of Paris from 1950 to 1956, gaining a PhD in Medicine.
In 1960 Tchoungui was medical superintendent of Yaoundé Central Hospital.
Political positions.
Tchoungui was appointed Minister of Public Health when a new federal cabinet was announced on 20 October 1961.
After federal legislative elections, on 1 July 1964 the cabinet was reshuffled.
Tchoungui was appointed Minister of National Economy. 
In 1965 he was briefly Minister without portfolio.
On 18 November 1965, East Cameroon Prime Minister Vincent de Paul Ahanda was dismissed from office due to a dispute with President Ahmadou Ahidjo. Tchoungui was named his successor, and would remain head of the East Cameroon government until May 1972. 
Ahidjo, who was from the Hausa-Fulani north of the country, made a practice of appointing Beti Prime Ministers from the center/south to maintain balance.
In June 1966 President Ahidjo called a conference that included the leaders of the two main political parties, the KNDP and CPNC and the Prime Ministers of West and East Cameroon.
The participants decided to "reinforce national unity" by merging their parties into one, the Cameroon National Union (In French: "Union Nationale Camerounaise" - UNC).
The new party came into legal existence on 1 September 1966, with Ahidjo as President and Tchoungui one of two vice-presidents.
Elections were held for the Federal and East Cameroon governments on 7 June 1970 and were won by the UNC candidates, as expected.
On 12 June 1970 Tchoungui was reappointed Prime Minister of Eastern Cameroun. 
He left this post on 20 May 1972 when the United Republic of Cameroon was declared.
Tchoungui, a Catholic, played a role in the affair of Bishop Albert Ndongmo.
Ndongmo was credibly suspected of being involved with rebels led by Ernest Ouandié.
The Archbishop of Yaoundé, Jean Zoa, requested that Tchoungui ask the Pope to summon Ndongmo to Rome and then invite him to remain there.
Ndongmo, who insisted on his innocence, did go to Rome but then returned to face trial. He was arrested immediately after arriving, and after several months of interrogation faced a military tribunal in January 1971, which sentenced him to death for treason. Ahidjo later commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. 
The affair caused tension between Muslims and Christians: some churches were burned in the North.
It also caused dissension among Catholics, some of whom condemned Archbishop Zoa for being too close to the government, and for possibly assisting in removal of a popular rival.
Other activities.
Tchoungui was elected first president of the Cameroon Red Cross Society on 30 April 1960, an honorary position.
Tchoungui remained a prominent member of the UNC.
On 24 March 1984 the UNC became the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (In French, "Rassemblement démocratique du Peuple Camerounais" - RDPC). Tchoungui was a member of the RDPC central committee.
Simon Pierre Tchoungui died in July 1997.

Jamaica Say You Will (song)

"Jamaica Say You Will" (alternately "Jamaica, Say You Will") is a song written and performed by American singer-songwriter Jackson Browne. It is the first song on his 1972 self-titled debut album.
History.
The song was released by The Byrds on their "Byrdmaniax" album the year before Browne's version came out, so many people were familiar with it before ever hearing Browne's recording.
Browne has referred to the song as a "fable," but one based in real experience. "I thought I was kind of writing it for this girl I knew that worked in a garden in Zuma Beach, across the street from the Pacific Ocean, and she worked in this organic food orchard," Browne said in an interview, "like the Garden of Eden, and she was the kind of Eden-like girl, too." He continues: "When I created the fable of this girl who lived by the sea and whose father is a captain, and eventually she would be taken away and go sailing off, I wanted to hide in the relationship. I wanted to sort of have the cocoon of this relationship to just stay sort of insulated from the world. And she was ready to move out into the world and was... you know, the relationship had broken up. That's the ... reality that was going on in my life. I just think it's odd that that's exactly how songs come into being, but if you feel it, it's about something."
Fitting into Browne's concern with water-based lyric themes, the song seemingly is a more straightforwardly traditional and conventional narrative than much of Browne's other early works, but the lyrics about a lost love can be read dually as a period piece - with its references to Jamaica as "daughter of a captain on the rolling seas" and to her sister ringing the "evening bell" - and, as Browne seems to confirm, as a memory of a lost young love from Browne's past near the California coast.
The narrator wants her to stay to "help me find a way to fill these empty hours; say you will come again tomorrow," but "next thing I knew, we had brought her things down to the bay -- what could I do."
Reception.
Calling it an "exquisite love song," in 1972, Bud Scoppa in "Rolling Stone" spent a large part of his review discussing and gushing about "Jamaica Say You Well," explaining how he felt the song "perfectly embodies Browne's writing and performing approach:"
"A full-chorded grand piano gives the song a rolling, even motion and a certain austerity of mood. Browne plays his voice off the piano's restrained tone, soaring up from his own basically understated vocal in mid-verse and chorus. This underplaying of mood lights Jackson's simple but evocative images with a muted radiance that aurally captures the look of "McCabe and Mrs. Miller." While the music sets the tone, Browne deftly tells the tale, his imagery charged with vivid suggestion. ... Much of the dramatic force of "Jamaica" derives from its gorgeous choruses. Each chorus builds tension by offsetting its lyrical meter from the movement of the music, so that the first part of each line is packed tightly and the second part is stretched out, as here, in the second chorus:
Harmonies enter at the "Sayyy" section of each of the first three lines, accenting the rush of words that precedes them. All the tension built up by the struggle for balance between the lyrical and musical structures resolves itself gracefully in the even last line. Naturally, Browne's single-minded delivery drives the tension to even greater heights, and the song soars. It's as moving a love song as I've ever heard."
Clarence White, along with Browne, played acoustic guitar on the song.

Milly Milly

Milly Milly or Milly Milly Station is a pastoral lease and operating sheep and cattle station located about west of Meekatharra in the Mid-West of Western Australia. The neighbouring stations are Nookawarra to the south and Beringarra Station to the north east.
Description.
The station occupies an area of , with the homestead situated alongside the Murchison River. The boundaries of the station are approximately from east to west and from north to south. The property has double frontage to stretch of the Wooramell River as well as a portion of the length of the Murchison River.
The area is well vegetated with Mulga and Salt bush as well as grass that grows in abundance and which was often cut to make hay. In 1910 25 tons of hay was cut and stacked for homestead stock.
History.
In 1909 the total recorded rainfall at Milly Milly was . The total rainfall for 1911 was over 18 falls then in 1912 a total of was recorded and in 1913 was which was measured over 31 falls. The average rainfall of the area is about .
The country was pioneered by Mr. T. O'Grady, his brother Robert O'Grady and two other men. O'Grady constructed a rudimentary hut and shearing shed a few miles from the current homestead. The party came down with a fever in their first year and a shepherd ended up taking the sick man to Geraldton in a cart for treatment. One of the men died during the journey. Upon returning the O'Gradys built the current homestead.
The station came into the hands of James Aitkin and a Mr. Birrell prior to 1879. Birrell died afterward leaving his share to be put up for auction which in turn was acquired by Aitkin. Aitkin who had moved over from Victoria in 1879 with enough capital to get Milly Milly well established.
The homestead was washed away in the floods of 1884, so a new one was built about from the old location. The new building was constructed of sandstone and limestone, both quarried locally with local Salmon Gum being used to provide timber, the floors are made of cement to prevent damage from white ants. A large kitchen and roomy bedrooms are surrounded by a large verandah.
In 1886 the station sheared over 20,000 sheep and the station was being managed by an Archie Campbell, who had been there since 1883.
The Murchison district was hit by drought in 1891 but Milly Milly, along with Boolardy and Murgoo Station were believed to be the best off.
Murder occurred at Milly Milly in 1893, when an Aboriginal woman was killed as she walked to Nookawarra Station with a worker from the station, Peter John Keeshan, where Keeshan was catching the mail coach, Keeshan was accused of the killing an went to trial but was found not guilty.
Flooding occurred at Milly Milly and other stations along the Murchison including Mileura following heavy rains in March and April 1900. Buildings were washed away and much fencing was lost along with stock being drowned.
The station was briefly owned by Archibald M'Kellar of Geraldton who had inherited it from his brother in law, James Aitken. M'Kellar, who was described as being "of eccentric disposition" died in 1904 and left a will leaving his estate to a cousin in Scotland and to hospitals in Perth, Fremantle and Geraldton, but neglected to specify the share each would receive.
Acquired shortly afterward by the Mulcahy brothers, Daniel and Michael, who were well known hoteliers in Perth, Fremantle and Kalgoorlie in 1905. The brothers left the property under the management of Fred Caeser who had been manager at Milly Milly since about 1899.
The station had approximately of fencing and was under the management of Fred Caeser in 1910. At the time the station was carrying 27,000 merinos which gave an annual clip of 480 bales. 4,000 fat lambs were sold-off from the station the previous year. The station also carrys a herd of 2,700 shorthorn cattle as well 300 odd horses.
A second murder occurred at the station in November 1912 when the cook, James Carlo, was arrested after the station accountant, Percy Tompkiss, was poisoned. Tompkiss' body was found to contain traces of arsenic, used in sheep dip, which it was thought he consumed in a tinted bottle of whiskey. Carlo was committed to stand trial for murder in October 1913 At trial Carlos was acquitted on lack of evidence.
In 1914 the station was still owned by the Mulcahy family and stocked with between 8,000 to 10,000 sheep as well as approximately 1,500 cattle. The property boasted 48 windmills, mostly shallow but some to a depth of . Mr G. R. Monger had managed the station since 1912.
In 1917 Michael Mulcahy died leaving his brother Daniel to carry on their pastoral and hotel interests.
Daniel Mulcahy died in June 1925 at his home in Fremantle at age 58. His wife a 10 children were at Milly Milly at that time and received the news via Byro Station.
In 1925 the trustees of the late Dan Mulcahy purchased the thorough bred stallion "Star Comedy", the third sire bought for the station over the last few years. The first being "Mait Mark" who died shortly after arriving and the second "Hostage" was euthanased after breaking a leg. "Star Comedy" was a foal of "Comedy King", a Melbourne Cup winner.
The Mulcahy family turned down some offers on the property including one for £80,000 in 1930.
Rain from the remains of Cyclone Emma in 2006 caused flooding along the much of the Murchison River including Milly Milly where the homestead resembled a small island of dry land among the floodwaters that submerged much of the property.
The station had a poor season with drought striking in 2010. The station manager, Simon Broad, had been feeding stock with lupins and hay as a result of lack of feed on the ground. Calves had to be separated from their mothers and penned near the homestead where they were fed milk replacement pills.
The lesse in 2012 was the Milly Milly Pastoral company, the station is operating under the Crown Lease number CL139-1967 and has the Land Act number LA3114/625.

Summer of 2012 derecho series

During the summer of 2012, a series of severe wind events associated with powerful thunderstorms, known as derechos, affected widespread areas of the United States. The first of these derechos occurred in late June, and caused power outages that affected nearly five million people. Three weaker derechos occurred in July, and a final derecho disrupted activities in Chicago, Illinois in early August. Only three tornadoes were reported in conjunction with the derechos.
June 29–30 event.
On June 29, a powerful derecho with wind gusts over 90 mph began in Chicago and moved all the way to the east coast, causing massive damage in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. Damage affected large population centers such as Fort Wayne, Indiana, Columbus, Ohio, Charleston, West Virginia, Richmond, Virginia, Washington, DC, Kentucky, and Atlantic City, New Jersey. This was the first of three derechos to affect west-central Ohio.
July 2 event.
On July 2, a much less long-lived derecho moved due south from Kentucky through Tennessee over about 300 miles. It was about as wide as its track was long.
July 24 event.
On July 24, a very small derecho moved through Chicago (the second in four weeks) through Indiana, western Ohio (the second of three in four weeks), and down into Kentucky where its damage path broke up.
July 26 event.
The fourth derecho in four weeks struck much of the eastern US on July 26 as a cold front brought the necessary conditions for a serial derecho. This began over Lake Erie, and spread rapidly to the northeast and southwest as it made landfall in northern Ohio and Pennsylvania. Several bow echos developed separately, even taking on the characteristics of multiple single-bow derechos, before all of the segments connected into a line echo wave pattern, the classic shape of a multi-bow serial derecho on radar. Notably, it was the fourth to hit the US within four weeks, and some areas such as Dayton, Ohio experienced three derechos within this span, where on average they receive only one derecho per year. Remnants of the derecho continued to produce isolated severe weather across the eastern US overnight. Five people were injured as a result of the storm.
August 4 event.
On August 4, a derecho traveled 300 miles from east Iowa to Ohio, disrupting the Lollapallooza festival in Chicago. There were over 150 reports of wind damage from this storm, with five reports of hurricane force winds (more than 74 mph) and a tornado. The derecho narrowly missed the same west-central Ohio area which was struck by three derechos within four weeks from the end of June to the end of July.

Bakery (band)

Bakery were an Australian progressive, hard rock band formed in 1970 in Perth. The original line-up was Hank Davis on drums (ex-Avengers, a New Zealand band), Mal Logan on keyboards (ex-Rebels), Eddie McDonald on bass guitar (Avengers), Peter Walker on guitar (Jelly Roll Bakers) and John Worrall on vocals and flute. They released two albums on Astor Records, "Rock Mass for Love" (August 1971) and "Momento" (August 1972) and had a Perth hit with "No Dying in the Dark". Bakery appeared at the Sunbury Pop Festival in January 1973 and disbanded in early 1975.
History.
Bakery were a progressive hard rock band formed in early 1970 in Perth by two New Zealand-born musicians, Hank Davis on drums and Eddie McDonald on bass guitar – both were ex-members of Avengers. The line-up was completed by Mal Logan on keyboards (ex-Rebels, a New Zealand band), Peter Walker on guitar (ex-Jelly Roll Bakers) and John Worrall on vocals and flute. Logan soon left and, by October, he was a member of Healing Force and, later, in Chain and Little River Band. By mid-1970, Bakery's Davis, McDonald and Walker were joined by Rex Bullen on keyboards (Bitter Lemons) and Tom Davidson on vocals. Worrall had left for Ssarb and in 1972 was a founding member of Fatty Lumpkin.
Bakery's debut album, "Rock Mass for Love", was issued in August 1971 on Astor Records which, according to Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane, had been recorded live at a Mass "held at St George's Cathedral on 21 March 1971" and was "not indicative of the band's style of progressive hard rock". The group released two singles, "Bloodsucker" (February 1971) and "No Dying in the Dark" (July), before Mark Verschuer (Barrelhouse) replaced Davidson on vocals. "No Dying in the Dark" was a top ten hit on the Perth singles chart. The band's influences were Black Sabbath, Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin.
In August 1972 they released their second album, "Momento", by which time Steve Hogg had replaced McDonald on bass guitar and also performed vocals (Juke, King Biscuit Company, Nostra Damus) and Peter Ewing replaced Bullen on organ and vocals; when Verschuer left he was not replaced as Davis, Ewing, Hogg and Walker shared lead vocals. McDonald initially joined a new group, McAskill, and by 1975 was a member of the Phil Manning Band. Bullen worked in Jim Keays' Southern Cross and Marc Hunter's backing band before Bullen died in March 1983. In January 1973 Bakery performed at the Sunbury Pop Festival and played the festival and concert circuit along Australia's east coast. In February that year, New Zealand-born Barry Leef joined on lead vocals. In April "Living with a Memory", from their Sunbury performance, appeared on the triple-live album "The Great Australian Rock Festival Sunbury 1973" on Mushroom Records. By that time Phil Lawson had replaced Hogg on bass guitar, with Lawson replaced in August by Jackie Orszaczky (Syrius). The group continued to perform without further recording until February 1975.

Jaki Byard with Strings!

Jaki Byard with Strings! is an album by pianist Jaki Byard recorded in 1968 and released on the Prestige label. It is a sextet recording, with George Benson (guitar), Ray Nance (violin and vocals), Ron Carter (cello), Richard Davis (double bass), and Alan Dawson (drums and vibraphone).
Music.
Critic Gary Giddins commented that, "a few complicated arrangements notwithstanding, this album is mostly an upbeat jam". One of the complicated arrangements was "Cat's Cradle Conference Rag" – each of five musicians "play five standards based on similar harmonies simultaneously". With the drummer added, these were: "Take the A Train" (Byard); "Jersey Bounce" (Nance); "Darktown Strutters' Ball" (Benson); "Intermission Riff" (Davis); "Desafinado" (Carter); and "Ring Dem Bells" (Dawson).
Reception.
Allmusic awarded the album 4 stars with its review by Scott Yanow, stating, "The repertoire includes a jammed version of "How High the Moon," a couple of tricky Byard originals and the then-current pop tune "Music to Watch Girls By." But more significant than the songs is the playing by the distinctive musicians who almost make the band sound like a regular group rather than a one-time get-together". Giddins was also positive; he picked out Ray Nance's solo on "How High the Moon": it "ranks with the one he recorded on Dizzy Gillespie's "Lover Come Back to Me" as the best work of his later years".

Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 1

Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1) is a member of the TET family of enzymes that in humans is encoded by the TET1 gene.
TET1 catalyzes the conversion of the modified DNA base 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC). TET1 produces 5-hmC by oxidation of 5-mC in an iron and alpha-ketoglutarate dependent manner. The conversion of 5-mC to 5-hmC has been proposed as the initial step of active DNA demethylation in mammals.

Giovanni Stefano Donghi

Giovanni Stefano Donghi (1608 – 26 November 1669) was an Italian Catholic cardinal.
Early life.
Donghi was born in Genoa in 1608, the son of Bartolomeo Donghi and Giacoma Bernardi. Little is known of his early education but he completed studies at the University of Bologna and the University of Salamanca.
Ecclesiastic career.
Throughout the 1630s, Donghi was employed in a number of administrative positions in Rome including referendary of the Tribunals of the Apostolic Signature of Justice and of Grace and president of the Apostolic Chamber.
In 1643 he acted as commissary-resident for the three legations held by Cardinal Antonio Barberini over regions in which he did not reside - effectively operating as the cardinal's representative in those regions when the cardinal was not there. He was also sent by the pope as legate to Lombardy during the First War of Castro to reach a peace agreement with the Dukes of Parma after the pope renounced the peace agreement negotiated by Cardinal Bernardino Spada.
Donghi was made cardinal-deacon by Pope Urban VIII in the consistory of July 1643 and deacon of San Giorgio in Velabro in August of that year. When Urban died the following year, he participated in the papal conclave of 1644 that elected Pope Innocent X. Donghi was openly a part of the Spanish faction of the College of Cardinals.
Thereafter he was named plenipotentiary of Pope Innocent during the Second War of Castro, returned to Lombrady and helped to reach a treaty with the Duchy of Parma.
In 1655 he was appointed bishop of Imola and in 1663 he resigned that commission and was appointed bishop of Ferrara - a title he held until his death.
He participated in the conclave of 1655 which elected Pope Alexander VII and the conclave of 1667 which elected Pope Clement IX.
He died on 26 November 1669 and was buried in the "Chapel of the Madonna" at the Church of the Gesù in Rome.

Water filling algorithm

Water filling algorithm is a general name given to the ideas in communication systems design and practice for equalisation strategies on communications channels. As the name suggests, just as water finds its level even when filled in one part of a vessel with multiple openings, as a consequence of Pascal's law, the amplifier systems in communications network repeaters, or receivers amplify each channel up to the required power level compensating for the channel impairments. See, for example, channel power allocation in MIMO systems.
Single channel systems.
In a single channel communication system the deamplification and loss present on the can be simplistically taken as attenuation by a percentage "g", then amplifiers restore the signal power level to the same value at transmission setup by operating at a gain of 1/ (1-g). E.g. if we experience 6dB attenuation in transmission, i.e. 75% loss, then we have to amplify the signal by a factor of "4x" to restore the signal to the transmitter levels.
Multichannel systems.
Same ideas can be carried out in presence impairments and a multiple channel system. Amplifier nonlinearity, crosstalk and power budgets prevent the use of these waterfilling algorithms to restore all channels, and only a subset can benefit from them.

Zuma, Sudan

Zuma is a village and burial ground about downstream from Jebel Barkal in what is now Sudan. It lies about south of El-Kurru, in the Napatan Region, on the right side of the Nile. The cemetery was visited several times by researchers in the last two hundred years, but there were only brief descriptions written, and no excavations. A plan was drawn up during the expedition of Karl Richard Lepsius. UNESCO inscribed Zuma's 20 hectares as a world cultural heritage site in 2003.
Modern, systematic excavations began in December 2004 by a Polish-Sudanese team. On the surface, 29 grave mounds are seen. Three grave types are distinguished, mainly based on the grave mound. Type I consists of hills, which are completely covered with stones. The grave mounds have a diameter of and were high. The hills of type II have a diameter of . They are built of sand and loose stones. A stone ring that goes around the hill keeps them together. The underground burial shaft is M-shaped (when viewed from above) and has two chambers, one for the funeral and the other for the grave goods. The hills of type III are flat and less than high. They have a diameter of and only a single grave chamber. All grave chambers were robbed. However, they showed evidence of having contained pottery, beads, metal fragments and animal bones. Ceramics found in the graves dated late 5th and early 6th centuries.

Beer in Singapore

History of beer in Singapore dates back to the mid-19th century. 
The Archipelago Brewery, established in 1931, was the first commercial brewery in Singapore, started by Becks.
During World War II, the British – deeming it enemy territory for German ties – seized the factory in 1941 and it was bought by "Malaysian Breweries" in 1941. In 1990, it was renamed to Asia Pacific Breweries (APB).
The main domestic brand is Tiger Beer, brewed by APB since 1932. APB also brews Heineken Lager Beer under a license from its parent company.
Other notable brands include Anchor, Baron’s Strong Brew and ABC Extra Stout
Since the late 1990s a number of micro-breweries have emerged on the Singapore market, the first being Brewerkz. 
Red Dot Brewhouse has 2 outlets, including one on the well trodden Boat Quay strip. 
level33, which claims to be the highest micro brewery in a building in the world, offers a stunning view of the city and is well worth a visit. There is also Paulaner Brauhaus, serving German beers near the Pan Pacific Hotel and the Pump Room, located in the centre of Clarke Quay which offers some very good craft beers from 11am up until the early morning. In June 2012, Moa Brewery Co., from New Zealand launched a new micro-brewery in Changi, making it the most Easterly of the craft brew pubs in Singapore. 
An annual Beer Festival, Beerfest Asia, is held in Singapore in June each year and attracts over 30,000 beer lovers and over 350 beers from around the globe. The Asia Beer Awards is the largest Beer Awards held in Asia and attracts close to 500 entries, demonstrating the demand for new beers and growth of a taste for beer in the region.

Kadammanittapally

St.John's Orthodox Church, Kadammanitta, (also known as Kadammanitta pally) is a parish church under Thumpamon Diocese of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, named after St John the Baptist. The parish was founded in 1842. Sacred footprints of Gheevarghese Mar Gregorios of Parumala are claimed to be in the parish.
Evolution.
Prior to 18th century the Syrian Christians or 'Nasrani', also known as Saint Thomas Christians, had emigrated from various regions of central Travancore to Kadammanitta. These emigrants had worshiped in the neighborhood "Orthodox Valiyapally" church in Kozhencherry. Eventually for rituals like anointing of old and sick (Thailabishekam), Holy Communion (Vishudha Qurbana), and moving the departed for funeral and burial ceremony all the way from Kadammanitta to Kozhencherry became a tribulation for the believers and hence the construction of an Orthodox Syrian church in Kadammanitta was proposed.
In the year 1018 (A.D 1842) the devotees constructed a chapel. Later a smallpox epidemic swept through Kadammanitta; several people fell ill, and two died. After the believers prayed to Saint John the Baptist, the smallpox epidemic ceased. Subsequently, every year the 6th and 7th of 'Makaram' of the Malayalam month was honored as the 'Veliyaperunaal' and as an offertory 'vellayappam' and 'pazham' was given, a practice that still continues.
The prevailing chapel was constructed with straw and palm leaves and the chapel was enveloped with dense forest; people feared forest fires during extreme hot weather. Hence in place of the earth chapel a 'madhbaha' was built at an elevation of 5m, and an 'haikala' and stony wall at a height of 3m from ground.
In the year 1044 (A.D 1868) the government sanctioned a piece of land in the name of a person named Puthenpurackal Chandy Geevarughese, and the present church was erected. This church was solemnized by the metropolitan Joseph Mar Dionysius 5 of the Pulikattil family in A.D.1869.
In the meanwhile, son of Puthenpurackal Chandy, Geevarghese was ordained as the priest for the church. Geevarghese of Kadammanitta was a disciple of Parumala Thirumeni, and he had accompanied Parumala Thirumeni to Jerusalem.
Foundation stone and agreement.
In A.D.1875 the Antioch Patriarchies Bishop Pathrose Thrithian had arrived to Kerala. The parish members wished to bring him to visit Kadammanitta. The parish priest Geevarghese was informed about their desire, and made the necessary arrangements for the visit. According to this schedule, in A.D.1875, in the Malayalam month of 'Thulam 16th' (October 31) the Patriarch Bishop had arrived to Kadammanitta, accompanied by Parumala Thirumeni (Chathuruthy Geevarghese Ramban). The bishop was brought to church from 'Pariyaram Mylickal' in a palanquin through a stony and isolated way. The bishop blessed the people and commanded the building of a prominent church there, in place of the existing chapel. The bishop laid the foundation stone in favor of St.Paul & St.Peter (the former church). The footprints of St. Gregorios (Parumala Thirumeni) are believed to bless the St. John's Orthodox Church of Kadammanitta.
The growth and development of the former church advanced over the next 70 years. 21 prominent families signed an agreement in the year 1086, Malayalam month of 'Dhanu' 29th (A.D 1911), declaring that the church and its surrounding shall be independent from Puthepurackal family; the agreement was officially signed by Kulathoor Idiculla in Idicheriya Aranmula sub-registrar office in the year 1911 Malayalam month of 'Dhanu' 30th at 1:00pm. The copy of the agreement which mentions the maintenance of the church and its surroundings was provided to the 21 families.
Construction of the new church- 'KOODHASHA'.
Due to the increasing number of parishioners, the congregation held on the November 10th of A.D.1968 decided to construct a church large enough for all the parish members. However the location of the former church was too small, so more new land was acquired from Chavadyil Mrs.Sosamma George and Mr.Babu and registered in the name of diocese metropolitan Daniel Mar Peelaksinos in 1975, in the time of Fr.P.K.Mathews. Initial construction works of the new church began.
In 1983, during the service period of Fr.Thaiyil.T.M.Samuel, in the month of October, Daniel Mar Peelaksinos laid the foundation stone. In 1985, Fr.Peter Thomas was named parish vicar. By the support and guidance of the vicar Fr.Peter, the parish priest Karingattil Fr.K.C.Jacob, Kizhakeparambil Fr.K.T.Mathukutty (Convener of church construction) and the hard work and effort of the people, the church was built by 1989. On 20 and 21 January, in the presence of the bishop of Malankara Orthodox Church Baselios Marthoma Mathews, the Catholicate Designate (Neeyuktha Bava) Mathew Mar Coorilos, Daniel Mar Philexinos (Thumpamon diocese), Geevarughese Mar Osthanious (Niranam), Philipos Mar Yuosebious (Thumpamon diocese) consecrated the church.
The priest in charge of the parish services.
Puthenpurackal Geevarghese Geevarghese Kathanar was the first priest of St John's Orthodox Parish, and served the church for many years. He was a great follower of Parishudha Parumala Thirumeni as he had visited Jerusalem with this him. In 1990 he had accompanied Parumala Thirumeni to Trivandrum St George Orthodox Church to perform the consecration of the church. Kathanar fell ill and died, and was buried in an English cemetery as it was difficult to bring the body back to Kadammanitta. The funeral service was led by Parishudha Parumala Thirumeni.
From 1900 until 1930 Palumootil Thengumtharayil Geevarughese Cor-Episcopa, Thengumtharayil Fr.T.C. Geevarughese, Mezhuveli Kadavatharayil Veliyachen, Kochachen, had served as the parish vicars. P.C.Geevarughese, son of Puthenpurackal Fr. Geevarughese Geevarughese, was ordained as a priest for the church.
Subsequently Vayalathala Vadasheriyath Fr.Gaberial, Puthenpeedika Thekkutathil Fr.K.C.Koshy had administrated the works of the parish. After these priests, in 1946 a member of Puthenpurackal family, Karingattil Fr.K.C.Jacob was ordained as a priest for the church.
Until 1971 services in the church were held only every other month, increasing to four times during the dedicated service of Fr.K.C.Oommen. In 1975 Fr. K T mathews, Kizhakeparambil Son of Sri.K.G.Thomas was ordained as the priest.
On August 5, 2012, Fr. P. J Joseph took charge as vicar of the church and Fr. Gabriel Joseph transferred to Mylapra orthodox church.

Soldier Creek Dam is an earthen dam on the Strawberry River, located in Wasatch County, Utah in the United States. The dam forms Strawberry Reservoir, and is a principal feature of the Strawberry Valley Project, part of the Bonneville Unit of the Central Utah Project. The dam and reservoir were built and operated by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR).
Constructed between 1970 and 1974, the dam replaced the earlier Strawberry Dam, built slightly upstream of the current site from 1911–1913. The new dam increased the storage capacity of Strawberry Reservoir from to more than . The primary purpose of the dam is to store flows from the upper Strawberry River, as well as water diverted from eight tributaries of the Duchesne River, for diversion through the Strawberry Tunnel to supplement water supplies in the Utah Valley. Water from the Strawberry Tunnel eventually outlets into Six Water Canyon, the Diamond Fork River and finally the Spanish Fork River before flowing into Utah Lake.
Soldier Creek Dam is a zoned earthfill embankment high and long, with a structural volume of . Water releases from the dam are controlled by outlet works with a bypass capacity of . The dam controls runoff from a drainage area of .

List of breweries in Nevada

Breweries in Nevada produce a wide range of beers in different styles that are marketed locally and regionally. Brewing companies vary widely in the volume and variety of beer produced, from small nanobreweries and microbreweries to massive multinational conglomerate macrobreweries. 
In 2012 Nevada's 27 brewing establishments (including breweries, brewpubs, importers, and company-owned packagers and wholesalers) employed 130 people directly, and more than 10,000 others in related jobs such as wholesaling and retailing. Altogether 19 people in Nevada had active brewer permits in 2012. 
Including people directly employed in brewing, as well as those who supply Nevada's breweries with everything from ingredients to machinery, the total business and personal tax revenue generated by Nevada's breweries and related industries was more than $286 million. Consumer purchases of Nevada's brewery products generated more than $124 million extra in tax revenue. In 2012, according to the Brewers Association, Nevada ranked 24th in the number of craft breweries per capita with 21.
For context, at the end of 2013 there were 2,822 breweries in the United States, including 2,768 craft breweries subdivided into 1,237 brewpubs, 1,412 microbreweries and 119 regional craft breweries. In that same year, according to the Beer Institute, the brewing industry employed around 43,000 Americans in brewing and distribution and had a combined economic impact of more than $246 billion.
History.
Brewing in the Nevada predates statehood, as the Carson City Brewery opened in 1860 four years before admission to the Union. Brewing in Nevada virtually ceased with statewide prohibition starting one year prior to nationwide prohibition. Only Carson Brewery and Reno Brewery remained to continue production in the 1930s, but statewide beer production had ceased in 1957. Breweries have regained popularity in the state since brewpubs were legalized in 1993.

Jake Needham (novelist)

Jake Needham is an American novelist and screen writer. He is known as one of the best-selling English-language authors in Asia. He is a frequent speaker at schools and universities throughout Asia and guest on Asian television and radio networks. His English-language crime and espionage novels are set in Asia, which offers realism and authenticity to the narrative. "Bangkok Post" called Needham "Michael Connelly with steamed rice." "Asia Business" magazine said that "Needham certainly knows where some bodies are buried," and Matt Crook] said on "CNN Travel" that "Needham's stories have a 'ripped from the headlines' feel." 
Personal background.
Needham was born in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Rice University with a Bachelor's degree in History and Economics and then obtained a Master's degree in Law from Georgetown University. He has been admitted to the bar in Washington, D.C., New York, and Texas. In addition to Texas, New York, and Washington, D.C., he has also lived in Los Angeles, Thailand, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Sydney, Australia. 
Since 1981, Needham has lived and worked in Asia. He is married to Pintuporn Sawamiphakdi, a graduate of Oxford University. She is the former editor of the Thai edition of "Tatler" magazine and a columnist with the "Bangkok Post". They have two sons and reside in Thailand and the United States.
Professional background.
Needham is a novelist and screenwriter. Much of his work is done at The Writer's Room in Greenwich Village. He has been the owner of a small television production studio, which allowed him to produce and write television programming. He began writing screenplays, in an effort to improve the profitability of the organization. While he lacked direct experience, his film scripts were often purchased and released on cable network television.
In 1994, he served as the screen writer and producer of the film "Natural Causes", starring Linda Purl, Ali MacGraw, and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. Prior to his death, actor James Gandolfini expressed interest in purchasing the film rights to Needham's book, "The Big Mango". Gandolfini wanted HBO Films to produce the work, desiring to star in the film, alongside Demi Moore. When HBO failed to step forward and act on their assertion that they wanted to purchase the rights to the film, the French production house of Canal+ made an offer, which Needham accepted. While Canal+ verbally agreed to retain Gandolfini as the star of the film, they later reneged on their agreement, stating their desire to bring on Tom Cruise as the lead. When Cruise declined, the licensing deal fell through.
Needham is known as one of the best-selling English-language authors in Asia. Until 2012, the print editions of books have been published by Marshall Cavendish Editions in Singapore. While Marshall Cavendish distributes his novels in Asia, Europe, Australia, and the United Kingdom, they are not available in North America. Needham's publishing contract with Marshall Cavendish ended over a disagreement pertaining to the content of his novel, "The Umbrella Man". Needham chose to end the contract when his publisher expressed concern that the Singapore government would be offended by the content. Following the termination of their publishing relationship, Needham's work has been published digitally through Half Penny Ltd of Hong Kong.

Domhnall Spainneach Mac Murrough Caomhanach

Domhnall Spainneach Mac Murrough Caomhánach (died 1632) was the last King of Leinster.
A descendant of Diarmait Mac Murchada (died 1171), Domhnall was the eldest of the two sons of Donnchadh Caomhánach, lord of the Art Buihde Caomhánach sept, who were reckoned the least powerful of the dynasty. Their lands lay north of Enniscorthy in the Blackstairs Mountains. It appears that at Donnchadh's death, Domhnall was taken into the care of the seneschal of Wexford, Thomas Stukeley. When Stukeley left for Spain in 1568 Domhnall went with him, which explains the origin of his nickname, "Spainneach". 
He returned to Ireland in the mid-1570s and became a leading member of his sept. He became a firm ally of Fiach McHugh O'Byrne with whom he intrigued until the latter's death in 1597. After O'Byrne's death, he intrigued with Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone. When the Nine Years' War (Ireland) ended in 1603, Domhnall submitted and was awarded a pension, as well as recognition of title to his lands. 
Domhnall was married to Elizabeth O'Byrne (died in or after 1608), and Eleanor Kavanagh (died in, or after, 1633), and had a total of six children. He successfully conveyed his property to his son, Sir Morgan Kavanagh (d. 1643). His only known brother was Cathaoir.

United States gubernatorial elections, 1973.
The 1973 gubernatorial elections were held in New Jersey and Virginia. Their general elections were on 6 November 1973. In both cases, a conservative managed to win in the end, while a moderate (or liberal) lost.
In Virginia, Mills E. Godwin, Jr. had won a term for governor as a Democrat in the 1965 gubernatorial election. This time, he won as a Republican. Howell too was also an ex-Democrat as well. Howell tried to run from a populist stance, but he wasn't successful. Godwin
pushed the conservative line and won.
In New Jersey, Cahill had the image of a moderate Republican, but scandals that he himself didn't do and a dislike of his stance
on taxes led to his defeat to Sandman, a more conservative Republican. Sandman wasn't liked by moderate Republicans and didn't
get their support, a factor that would favor Byrne in the end. It didn't help matters for Sandman that Cahill didn't give much support either beyond an endorsement.

Samuel Gookins

Samuel Barnes Gookins (born Rupert, Vermont, May 30, 1809; died Terre Haute, Indiana, June 14, 1880) was an American journalist, lawyer, politician, and judge of the Supreme Court of Indiana.
Early life.
Gookins was the youngest of ten children. In 1812 his parents William and Rhoda Gookins moved with most of their children to Rodman, New York, near the eastern end of Lake Ontario. Gookins' father died two years later. In 1823 Gookins' mother took him and an older brother west to settle about two miles outside of Terre Haute, Indiana, where other members of the family had settled three years earlier.
In July 1825 Gookins' mother died, and he was sent to live first with the family of Captain Daniel Stringham (father of Admiral Silas Stringham) and later with several of his older siblings. In 1826 he was apprenticed to John Osborn, the editor of the "Western Register" newspaper in Terre Haute. After completing his apprenticeship in 1830, he moved to Vincennes and started a newspaper there with a partner. After a year he moved back to Terre Haute to become the editor of the "Western Register", until the paper was purchased in June 1832 and replaced by the "Wabash Courier".
Career.
Gookins was about to depart for Washington, DC to pursue his editorial career when he was talked into reading for the bar by his friend Amory Kinney (one of the lawyers who had pursued the 1820 Polly v. Lasselle anti-slavery case). Gookins was admitted to the Vigo County bar in 1834 and the Indiana Supreme Court bar in 1836, and practiced until 1850, when he was appointed to a brief term as a replacement for the local circuit court judge. In 1851 Gookins was elected to the legislature, which had the job of passing new laws in the wake of a new Indiana constitution. Gookins and other lawyers proposed that each party nominate two candidates for the four member supreme court, to maintain balance, but their views were ignored in the subsequent elections. Gookins himself was nominated for an Indiana Supreme Court position by the Whigs in 1852, but their slate was defeated. Gookins ran again in 1855 for a vacant seat on the court and won.
In December 1857 Gookins resigned from the court due to ill health and financial pressures (the salary of the justices was only $1200, which Gookins considered low.) He then moved to Chicago and continued his legal career there until 1875, when he moved back to Terre Haute. Gookins and his partners argued many cases before the US Supreme Court.

Skredshol

Skredshol was a noble-seat farm ("setegård") in Norway. It is a large farm located in the former Nes municipality in Hedmark county. It lies on a peninsula extending into Mjøsa, Norway's largest lake. The farm's main building is protected as a historically significant residence. It had a total area of 202.6 hectares in 1998. 
Historically, as a "setegård", it was exempt from taxes and tithe. It is initially mentioned in records in 1403. The farm was owned by Norway’s Reich Chancellor Jens Bjelke and subsequently by his son, Jørgen Bjelke. In 1682, Skredshol was sold by Jørgen Bjelke (then Deputy Governor General of Norway, a Lieutenant General in the Norwegian Army, and sheriff for Bratsberg) to his brother-in-law, Hans von Løwenhielm. Two years later Caspar Christopher Brockenhuus became the owner. Since Brockenhuus was married to the daughter of Løwenhielm he received Skredshol farm and Hovinsholm farm as gifts from his father-in-law. Brockenhuus, who was colonel in the Oppland Infantry Regiment, had previously purchased Tjerne farm from Jørgen Bjelke; so from the 1680s Brockenhuus owned these three major Hedmark farms. 
From 1922 it has been in ownership of the Moslets family.

FIFA International Referees List

The FIFA International Referees List is the global list of referees in the football-variants controlled by FIFA - Association football (outdoor football), Futsal and Beach soccer. Members of the list are qualified to officiate at international level and are entitled to wear a FIFA badge on their uniform for the year in which they listed.
Nomination.
FIFA member countries are invited annually to nominate male and female officials for association football, futsal and beach soccer. Each country's Referee's Committee selects the referees to be nominated to FIFA.
FIFA maintains five lists in total: men's and women's association football referees, men's and women's futsal referees, and a single list of beach soccer referees. Officials in the association football lists are nominated as either referees or assistant referees. Futsal and beach soccer at international level are usually controlled by two on-field referees and there is no equivalent of the assistant referee.
Fitness.
Referees nominated to the list must pass fitness tests consisting of a series of 40 and 150 metre sprints.
FIFA badge.
On being selected to the list, referees receive a badge from FIFA. The badge indicates the category of official in which they have been listed - referee, assistant referee, Futsal referee or Beach soccer referee. While officiating matches in the category they have been nominated, the referee is expected to wear the badge. Where a referee is controlling a match outside of their category (e.g. an assistant referee acting as a central referee or a Futsal referee controlling an outdoor match) the badge is not worn. Members of the women's list are only allowed to work men's international matches if they have completed the men's fitness tests. Being listed for the first time is often referred to as receiving a FIFA badge.
Age.
To be included for the 2012 list, a referee must have been between at least 25 and no older than 44 as at 1 January 2012. Referees not previously listed had to be no older than 37 at the start of 2012.

Titus Claudius Aurelius Aristobulus

Titus Claudius Aurelius Aristobulus (died after AD 296) was a Roman military official and politician who served as Roman consul in AD 285.
Biography.
Aristobulus first appears as the Praetorian prefect under the emperor Carinus in AD 285. That same year he was made "consul posterior", serving alongside the emperor. He accompanied the emperor to the Battle of the Margus River, but ended up betraying Carinus and possibly even killing him on the battlefield, turning the tide of battle in favour of Carinus’ opponent, Diocletian. According to a contemporary source, the reason given for Aristobulus’ betrayal was for revenge – Carinus had forced Aristobulus’ wife to have an affair with him.
With the death of Carinus, the new emperor Diocletian rewarded Aristobulus by retaining him both as consul and as praetorian prefect for the remainder of the year.
Now a member of the senate, Aristobulus continued to flourish under the new regime. In AD 290, he was assigned as the Proconsular governor of Africa Proconsularis. His governorship was transferred to the new province of Byzacena during Diocletian’s reorganization of the empire’s provinces, which saw Africa Proconsularis divided three smaller provinces. During his time as governor, Aristobulus undertook major building activities. His tenure as governor probably ended on 1 July 294, when he was replaced by Cassius Dio.
From 11 January 295 until 18 February 296, Aristobulus was the "Praefectus urbi" of Rome.

Branch retinal artery occlusion

Branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) is a rare retinal vascular disorder in which one of the branches of central retinal artery is obstructed. 
Epidemiology.
The mean age of affected patients is 60 years. The right eye is affected more commonly than the left eye which probably reflects the greater possibility of cardiac or aortic emboli traveling to the right carotid artery.
Most of the cases are due to emboli to the retinal circulation. Three main types of retinal emboli have been identified: Cholesterol, platelet-fibrin and calcific emboli.
Risk factors.
Risk factors include:
Manifestations.
Abrupt painless loss of vision in the visual field corresponding to territory of the obstructed artery is the typical history of presentation. Patients can typically define the time and extent of visual loss precisely.
Retinal whitening that corresponds to the area of ischemia is the most notable finding. In chronic phase the retinal whitening disappears.
Diagnosis and testing.
Ancillary testing is not usually necessary to make the diagnosis. Fluorescein angiography reveals an abrupt diminution in dye at the site of the obstruction. Visual field testing can confirm the extent of visual loss.
Treatment.
No proved treatment exists for branch retinal artery occlusion.
In the rare patient who has branch retinal artery obstruction accompanied by a systemic disorder, systemic anti-coagulation may prevent further events.

Outline.
The original football team consisted of a group of teaching staff who were based within Yamaguchi prefecture, a team called , often abbreviated to "Yamaguchi Teachers" or "Yamaguchi KFC" (compare Tochigi S.C. and Gainare Tottori, who started as teachers' clubs and are now members of the J. League).
In February 2006, the Yamaguchi Football Association eyed the placement of a team from Yamaguchi in the J. League. Setting its heart of operations at Yamaguchi Teachers, a new football club was established. At the same time, a public appeal was made to name the new club, with "Renofa Yamaguchi F.C." being decided in March of the same year. The word "renofa" is a combination of three English words: renovation, fight and fine.
Without a specified home ground, the team played Chūgoku league matches across a number of different venues within the prefecture, including Yamaguchi Ishin Park Stadium, Yamaguchi Kirara Expo Memorial Park, Onoda Football Park, Shunan City Athletic Stadium and Yamaguchi Football Park. Now however, home games are played at Yamaguchi Ishin Park Stadium.
Though structured with a hometown manager and local players, sponsored by local business and enterprises, and local action plans within the local community, Renofa Yamaguchi F.C. is aiming for a national future in the J. League.
In the days of "Yamaguchi Teachers", the team frequently finished mid to low table in the Chūgoku league. However since the establishing of the new club in 2006, the team had consistently improved their final league position. This culminated in the 2008 season where they achieved their first league win. In the All Japan Regional Football Promotion League Series of that year the team finished fourth in the final round, missing the opportunity for promotion to the Japan Football League. The 2009 season saw them win their first Emperor's Cup match, beating Mitsubishi Motors Mizushima F.C. in a penalty shoot out.
Since the team's formation it had operated as a private organisation, however when the Nonprofit organization Yamaguchi Athletics Club was established on 24 May 2011, managing control of the team changed hands putting the new NPO in charge.

John Walsh (artist)

John Walsh is a painter who was born in 1954 in Tolaga Bay, New Zealand. He is of Aitanga a Hauiti/ New Zealand Irish decent. Although he attended Ilam School of Fine Arts in Christchurch between 1973 and 1974, he is largely a self-taught artist. He now lives and works in Wellington, New Zealand.
His workAlthough John Welsh started painting later in life, he has managed to create a name for himself on the New Zealand art scene. His first solo exhibition was the result of his appointment of curator at the National Art Gallery in Wellington (now known as Te Papa Tongarewa Museum). Since then, he continues to exhibit regularly in different galleries around New Zealand and has also had the opportunity to show his work abroad in Sydney, Australia and Noumea, New Caledonia.
John Walsh started with figurative imagery, portraying people he knew around the East Coast region. His otherworldly landscapes and figures would take another few years before emerging as a constant in his paintings. In the meantime, Walsh was invited to participate to a mural for in 1993, then moved on to work in a number of different institutions.
It was when Walsh was invited to work as a curator in Wellington that he developed a theme for his paintings. Walsh works on medium to large scale boards achieving textural effects through scratches and expressive gestural brushwork. His work evokes mythical creatures and vistas which eludes the concept of a specific location and time.
The recent exhibition "I Can't Stop Loving You" held at Gow Langsford Gallery retain the style of his earlier works while also demonstrating a new direction in the artist’s career. While a sense of the ethereal remains through the use of similar hues and tones, the artist’s interest shifts towards grand vistas rather than focussing on the mythical figures. However, one expects to see his otherworldly figures appear in the landscape at any given time.

Ledjie Taq

Ledjie Taq is the Kepala adat of the Wehea Dayak village of Nehas Liah Bing, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. He is known for his efforts to protect the Wehea Forest.
Background.
Ledjie Taq was born in the Wehea Dayak village of Nehas Liah Bing, on the Wehea River. He works as an elementary school teacher and farmer and became the elected leader (kepala adat) of the Wehea Dayak in 2002. Since this time he has been working to protect the Wehea Forest.
Protecting Wehea Forest.
In 2004, the Wehea Dayak community of Nehas Liah Bing (Nehas) feared their forest would be lost forever. In response to this threat, the community banded together and declared the Wehea Forest forest a “locally protected forest”. The man leading this conservation effort is the 61-year-old Ledjie Taq, the tribal leader of the Wehea Dayak of East Kalimantan. In recognition of conservation efforts, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia awarded Ledjie Taq the prestigious Bintang Jasa Pratama medal in 2009. In addition, Ledjie Taq won the Kalpataru Environment Savior Award, Indonesia's highest environmental honor.
Ledjie Taq gathered multi-lateral support for protecting Wehea Forest through a customary council meeting held in November 2004. Representatives from local Dayak communities, the local government and private sector attended this council meeting and agreed to support the declaration of 38,000 hectares of an abandoned timber concession as ‘protected land’ under Wehea Dayak traditional 'adat’ law. The newly established protected area was given the local name Keldung Laas Wehea Long Skung Metqueen (The Wehea protected forest located between the rivers of Skung and Metqueen).
Ledjie Taq and the Wehea Dayak community wanted to protect Wehea Forest because of its importance as a source for water and medicinal plants, as well as non-timber forest products. In addition, Ledjie Taq knew that protecting Wehea Forest was critical for helping to protect the Wehea Dayak culture. As cultural head of the Wehea Dayak, Ledjie Taq knew that if the forest around Wehea was lost, important traditions and ceremonies would be lost as well. Since Wehea Forest lies within the historical territory of the Wehea Dayak, Ledjie Taq knew that protecting Wehea Forest under adat law was also important for recovering some of the Wehea Dayak traditional land rights.
To guard the newly protected forest from illegal activities, Ledjie Taq used traditional Wehea Dayak practices for conservation and established the Petkuq Mehuey (PM’s), or forest guardians. He felt by merging traditional practices into the forest conservation program, the Wehea Dayak could also sustain and protect local traditions and culture. The PM’s are a group of young people from the local community who protect the forest. They spend up to three months in the forest patrolling the borders for illegal loggers, collecting data on the flora and fauna found in Wehea Forest, and helping to implement new programs and initiatives.

Surendra Jha 'Suman'

Surendra Jha 'Suman' (सुरेन्द्र झा 'सुमन') (10 October 1910 – 5 March 2002) also referred as 'Suman Ji (सुमन जी) ' or Acharya Surendra Jha 'Suman', was a renowned Maithili poet, writer, publisher, editor and elected member of legislative assembly and parliament. He is also known for his role as publisher, editor, journalist, social and cultural reformer and promoter of Mithila culture. He authored about forty books in Maithili and was also the Editor of various publications and books in Maithili, Sanskrit and Hindi. He served the Governing Bodies of various literary and academic institutions in different capacities in his State. He was also the recipient of Sahitya Akademy Award in 1971 for Payaswini and in 1995 for Translation Rabindra Natakavali Vol. I. He was born in a village known as Ballipur in the Samastipur district of Bihar.
Early life and family.
Surendra Jha 'Suman' was born on 10 October 1910 in Ballipur Village of District Samastipur, Bihar. His father Bhubaneswar Jha was a well known Ayurvedic practitioner. Traditionally the family belonged to Sanskrit scholars. He was educated at Dharmaraj Sanskrit College, Muzaffarpur and was a graduate in literature (Sahityacharya) and was also a Kavyatirtha (Bengal). He was married to Ganga Devi a native of Begusarai at the age of 25years. He has one son Brajendra Jha, and two daughters. He retired as a professor and HOD, Maithili Language in LNMU University Darbhanga, Bihar. He was elected a member of parliament from Darbhanga Lok Sabha Constituency on Janata Party ticket for the 6th Lok Sabha.
Work and contributions.
As a writer, both in the realm of prose and poetry, He had a superb command over several languages and this qualification brought him a reward from the then President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad. Besides the Sahitya Akademi award, in 1981 Maithili Akademi, Patna Awarded him Vidyapati Puraskar.
He was the Maithili representative in Sahitya Akademi and a member of its Maithili advisory board. He was president of All India Maithili Sahitya Parishad. He was associated with Vaidehi Samiti Darbhanga also.
He occupies a very prominent place in the modern Maithili literature. His choice of words, alliterations, metaphor and similes, use of prosody and description of seasons, have been unique in modern Maithili literature.
His Payasvini (1969), a collection of 25 poems about beauty of nature, colorful imagery and simplicity of rural life has won for him the Sahitya Akademi award for 1971. In this one can find metrical experiment to metaphor.
Payasvini is based on the idea of comparing poetry with a milch cow, as described in the Prithvisukta of Atharvaved and Brihadaranyakopnishad, where Vakdhenu has been described in Vth chapter VIIIth Brahman.
Here Pavas (Rainy Season) is as good asTamasi, Mrityunjaya and milch cow and the river has been compared with rasvanti (charming succulent woman), vanita (woman) and kavita (poetry). The mountain has been compared with an old man, a youth and a child.
Sumanji's poetry Dattavati (1962) describes the Sino-Indian War and contains patriotic fervour as in Bharat vandana (1970) and Antarnad (1970).
His Uttara (1980) is a Khandakavya (miniepic) the story has been taken from the Mahabharat it doesn't focuses the compactness of the character of Uttara only. In fact his style and verve of poetry is loaded with Sanskrit words, simile, Alankar and imagery of old Sanskrit poetry hence at times not relished by modern readers, not much acquainted with Sanskrit prosody.
His publications include Pratipada (1948). The very name suggests the new start, a new direction in Maithili poetry. Its introduction and dedication is also in poems. All the other 16 poems were composed before India achieved independence. It expresses suffocation felt by the poet under foreign rule. Similarly Kavitak Ahvan shows poetic inspiration and patriotic fervour. Samsan shows philosophical reflection on the cremation ground. The favorite topics of Sanskrit poets are treated with new imagery in Asadhasya pratham divase, Yamuna, Asuryampasya and Sharad. Similarly, the poet exalts the feelings of 'Haldhar' (ploughman) of today, higher than Balaram and Janaka of the Yore days of Dwapar and Treta.
His 'Ode to Tree' can favorably be compared with anyone of the best lyrics of any literature. Here he compares and admires the services, dedication and sacrifices of 'Tree' to mankind and associates them with those of an ascetic. Yugnirman visualises the future and Uktipratyukti reaches out to the heart of the down trodden. All these poems have since been collected in his anthologies of poems 'Pratipada'which is a landmark in modern Maithili.
His other collections of poetry areSaon-Bhado (1965), Archana (1961), Kathayuthika (1976) and many others. His Lalana Lahari (1969) is a vivid description of the peculiar characteristics of love making by girls of different provinces of India
His song in praise of the Ganga in Gangavtaran (1967) has been termed superb.
He has made himself memorable by writing on a number of topics. With his steadfast adherence to classical poise and dignity has produced literature of permanent value.
His excellent poetic qualities can be seen in the following lines:
<poem>
The jungles on all sides are thick with the smell of Bakul flower;
the Ketaki flower has filled the wind and made it dense.
In every home the she-peacock is dancing;
Everybody's eyes feast upon the dark clouds (meaning also Lord Krishna),
but it is in my home alone where the flame of love remains unquenched.
</poem>
This is the young lady of Alaka agonized on account of unrequited love. (A Survey Of Maithili Literature-R.K.Choudhary Pp. 199)
As a translator into Maithili he has chosen both poetry and prose. Mainly he translated from Bengali and Sanskrit. His translations from Bengali are:
Fiction writing.
Surendra Jha 'Suman' also ventured into fiction writing. In fact one of his short stories 'Brihaspatik Shes' (The inauspicious afternoon of Thursday) has been quite popular. He published his first anthology of short stories Kathamukhi. His novel 'Uganak Diyadvad ' deals with the Khavas (bonded labour) system of feudalistic society and the changes occurring in society in the light of modernity.
Mithila Press.
His contribution as a journalist, editor and publisher is remarkable which started with setting up of Mithila Press in 1948, dedicated to his quest of spreading awareness of Maithili language, culture and literature. It is still functioning under his son as Mithila Press Publications. He edited erstwhile edition of the Mithila Mihir (Old edition)
His calibre as an editor can be seen in the Mithilank of Mithila Mihir published in 1935.He has also edited: -
Swadesh first a monthly and then a daily. He has the credit to bring out first daily in Maithil, for which he suffered a heavy loss, spent his provident fund and devoted time and labour to publish this daily newspaper.
He successfully edited Prachi, a periodical published by Sahitya Akademi, regional office, Kolkata.It consisted of English translation of literature published in eastern India, namely, Assamese, Bengali, Maithili, Manipuri, Nepali and Oriya.
He was the editor of a popular monthly magazine named Vaidehi first a fortnightly and later on published monthly.
He compiled Maithili Prachin Geet (1977) a research work with Dr. Ramdev Jha.His other research work includes, a critical study:-
Political career.
Surendra Jha 'Suman' was a Member of Sixth Lok Sabha from 1977 to 1979 representing Darbhanga Parliamentary Constituency of Bihar.
An able Parliamentarian, Suman was a Member of the Committee on Official Language during 1977-78 and the Committee on Absence of Members from the Sittings of the House during 1978.

There's No Place I'd Rather Be

"There's No Place I'd Rather Be" is a song sung by Singaporean artiste, Kit Chan. Along with Will you, it serves as the official theme to the National Day Parade in 2007. The single is one of the few National Day Parade themes that doesn't mention Singapore's name. The song was originally written for Singapore Polytechnic's, ""Musical Superstar: The Pop Musical"". It was later sung by Project SuperStar finalist, Kelly Poon before being commissioned as an official National Day Parade theme in 2007.
Music Video.
Description.
Like every NDP music video, the music video is usually sponsored by a Singapore established company. For this short film, DBS Bank was the official sponsor.
Sypnosis.
As with "My Island Home", the video opens with a time lapse of a sunrise over Lower Peirce Reservoir. The scene instantly shifts to two senior citizens having morning breakfast along a five foot way. The film then cuts back to the sunrise before showing a delivery man throwing a copy of The Straits Times, at the singer's doorstep as she sips a cup of coffee calmly.
This is later continued as Chan sings the first verse of the song. She is seen clad in a red dress sitting at the yellow zone of The Float at Marina Bay sitting gallery. A pastiche of international landmarks follows as Chan drives in a red Mini Hatch. Similarly to the MTV of "My Island Home", scenes of daily life Singapore plays. Breaking the third wall, Chan is seen participating in these daily life activities at the same time.
As the video comes to an end, Kit is seen standing up from her seat to perform the finale of the short film. The MTV then closes with a time lapse of a sunset on the city.

<doc id="36556244" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36556244" title="Double ionization">
Double ionization

Double ionization is a process of formation of doubly-charged ions when laser radiation is exerted on neutral atoms or molecules. Double ionization is usually less probable than single-electron ionization. Two types of double ionization are distinguished: sequential and non-sequential.
Sequential double ionization.
Sequential double ionization is a process of formation of doubly-charged ions consisting of two single-electron ionization events: the first electron is removed from a neutral atom/molecule (leaving a singly-charged ion in the ground state or an excited state) followed by detachment of the second electron from the ion.
Non-sequential double ionization.
Non-sequential double ionization is a process whose mechanism differs (in any detail) from the sequential one. For example, both the electrons leave the system simultaneously (as in alkaline earth atoms, see below), the second electron's liberation is assisted by the first electron (as in noble gas atoms, see below), etc.
The phenomenon of non-sequential double ionization was experimentally discovered by Suran and Zapesochny for alkaline earth atoms as early as 1975.
Despite extensive studies, the details of double ionization in alkaline earth atoms remain unknown. It is supposed that double ionization in this case is realized by transitions of both the electrons through the spectrum of autoionizing atomic states, located between the first and second ionization potentials.
For noble gas atoms, non-sequential double ionization was first observed by L'Huillier. 
The interest to this phenomenon grew rapidly after it was rediscovered
in infrared fields and for higher intensities. Multiple ionization has also been observed. 
The mechanism of non-sequential double ionization in noble gas atoms differs from the one in alkaline earth atoms. For noble gas atoms in infrared laser fields, following one-electron ionization, the liberated electron can recollide
with the parent ion.
This electron acts as an "atomic antenna", absorbing the
energy from the laser field between ionization and recollision and
depositing it into the parent ion. Inelastic scattering on the
parent ion results in further collisional excitation and/or
ionization. This mechanism is known as the three-step model of non-sequential double ionization, which is also closely related to the three step model of high harmonic generation.
Dynamics of double ionization within the three-step model strongly depends on the laser field intensity. The maximum energy (in atomic units) gained by the recolliding electron from the laser field is formula_1, where
formula_2 is the ponderomotive energy, formula_3 is the laser field strength, and formula_4 is the laser frequency. Even when formula_5 is far below ionization potential formula_6 experiments have observed correlated ionization. 
As opposed to the high-formula_7 regime (formula_8)
in the low-formula_7 regime (formula_10) the assistance of the laser field during the
recollision is vital.
Classical and quantum analysis
of the low-formula_7 regime
demonstrates the following two ways of electron ejection after the recollision: First, the two electrons can be freed with little time delay compared to the quarter-cycle of the driving laser field. Second, the time delay between the ejection of the
first and the second electron is of the order of the quarter-cycle of the driving field. In these two cases, the electrons appear in different quadrants of the correlated spectrum. If following the recollision, the electrons are ejected
nearly simultaneously, their parallel momenta have equal signs,
and both electrons are driven by the laser field in the same
direction toward the detector
. If after the recollision, the electrons are ejected with a substantial delay (quarter-cycle or
more), they end up going in the opposite directions. These two types of dynamics produce distinctly different correlated spectra (compare experimental results

Yajaira Sierra Sastre

Dr. Yajaira Sierra Sastre (born 1977) is a Puerto Rican nanotechnology scientist, educator, and aspiring astronaut. She is part of a six-person crew, and the only Hispanic, selected to participate in a four-month long, Mars analog mission funded by NASA. Sierra Sastre aspires to become the first Puerto Rican woman to travel to outer space.
Early years.
Sierra Sastre was born in Guayama, Puerto Rico, and raised in the town of Arroyo where she received her secondary education. Throughout her childhood, she dreamed of becoming an astronaut. After graduating from Carmen Bozello de Huyke High School, she attended the Mayagüez Campus of the University of Puerto Rico where she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry. Sierra Sastre then worked as high school chemistry teacher and attended Cornell University, where she earned a Ph.D. in materials chemistry and nanotechnology. Nanotechnology (sometimes shortened to "nanotech") is the manipulation of matter on an atomic and molecular scale.
NASA's Mars simulation project.
NASA realized that, in long duration missions, astronauts do not eat enough. They experience "menu fatigue" and their overall food intake declines, which puts them at risk of nutritional deficiency, loss of bone and muscle mass, and lethargy. The NASA Human Research Program is funding a project called "HI-SEAS," an acronym for “Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation,” to determine the best way to keep astronauts well nourished during multiple-year missions to Mars or the moon.
A planetary module was built on the Hawaiian island of Mauna Loa, which simulates the living conditions for astronauts at a future base on Mars. It is believed that the saddle area side of the island resembles a Martian environment.
After receiving more than 700 applications for positions as crew members of the simulated Mars mission, NASA and researchers from Cornell University and the University of Hawaii at Mānoa chose six astronaut-like individuals. Sierra Sastre was part of the selected crew with qualifications similar to those required by NASA for their astronaut applicants. The other five are Dr. Oleg Abramov, Simon Engler, Kate Greene, Sian Proctor and Angelo Vermeulen. Three additional individuals will make up the reserve crew.
Prior to the four-month mission, which began on March 2013, the crew participated in a two-week training session. Once the mission began the crew was not be allowed to have any communication with the outside world, except for limited e-mail. If they step outside the module they will have to wear simulated space suits. During the mission they will test new forms of food and food preparation strategies for deep-space travel.
Sierra Sastre and her colleagues emerged from the space habitat on August 13, ending the four-month simulated mission. According to Sierra Sastre and the scientists involved in the mission, the food ingredients that will be essential for future space missions on Mars or the moon will include spices, herbs and hot sauce. Also comfort foods such as Nutella, peanut butter and margarine. Plus, certain foods which contain ingredients which are rich in fiber.
Astronaut applicant.
In November 2011, NASA announced 15 available positions for its team of astronauts. Sierra Sastre sent her application in January 2012. Her participation in the Mars project puts her one step closer to achieving her dream of becoming the first female Puerto Rican astronaut.
Sierra Sastre lives in Ithaca, New York. She is a freelance educator working with disadvantaged school districts and communities in Puerto Rico. Sierra Sastre also collaborates in a variety of projects with the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network and the Cornell Nanoscale Facility, which included writing the smallest national anthem ever written, "La Borinqueña Más Pequeña" (the Puerto Rican national anthem). Among the scientific works which she has co-authored is the 2008 article ""Vertical Growth of Ge Nanowires from Biotemplated Au Nanoparticle Catalysts,"" published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, volume 130, issue 10488.

Pedro Sarmiento (cardinal)

Pedro Sarmiento (c1478–1541) was a Spanish Roman Catholic bishop and cardinal.
Biography.
Pedro Sarmiento was born in Ribadeo ca. 1478, the son of Pedro Ruiz de Sarmiento, 1st count of Salinas, and María de Villandrado, "señora" of Ribadeo. He studied civil law and canon law at the University of Salamanca and the University of Valladolid.
He became a canon of the cathedral chapter of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in 1496. He also became a canon of the chapter of the cathedral at Tui, Pontevedra. He was the last abbot of the monastery of Santa Marta in Astorga. He took orders as a deacon and was a perpetual beneficiary of the parish church of Fuentes de Duero.
He went on to serve as a chaplain to the Catholic Monarchs. Under Charles I of Spain, he was made the king's almoner and sacristan major of his chapel.
On March 4, 1523, he was elected bishop of Tui, though he never visited the diocese, governing through officers. On October 26, 1524, he was transferred to the see of Badajoz, and then on July 3, 1525 to the see of Palencia, taking possession of that diocese on August 18, 1527. 
He was a witness at the signing of the Treaty of Madrid (1526) which freed Francis I of France. He accompanied Charles I of Spain, who was now Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, in the emperor's trips to Flanders, Italy, and Germany. He was present at the imperial coronation in Bologna on February 24, 1530.
On June 8, 1534, he was promoted to the metropolitan see of Santiago de Compostela, taking possession of the archdiocese on June 10, 1536.
He accompanied the emperor to Italy again in 1538. 
At the request of the emperor and the emperor's daughter Margaret of Parma (who married Pope Paul III's grandson Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma on November 4, 1538), the pope created Sarmiento a cardinal priest in the consistory of October 18, 1538. He received the red hat and the titular church of Santi Apostoli on November 15, 1538.
On January 28, 1541, he became the administrator of the see of Anagni, though he quickly resigned that administration on April 6, 1541.
He died in Lucca on October 13, 1541. He was initially buried in the Dominican monastery in Anagni. His relative Juan Sarmiento, abbot of Benevivere in Palencia, later had his remains transferred to the abbey of Benevivere.

James Cameron (Union colonel)

James Cameron (March 1, 1800 – July 21, 1861) was a Pennsylvanian who served as colonel of the 79th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment of the Union Army during the early days of the American Civil War (Civil War). He was the brother of Simon Cameron, United States Senator and first United States Secretary of War in the cabinet of President Abraham Lincoln. At the age of 61, James Cameron was killed in action at the First Battle of Bull Run, the first large battle of the war, on July 21, 1861.
Early life.
James Cameron was born on March 1, 1800 in Maytown, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. His parents were Charles Cameron and Martha Pfoutz. His older brother, Simon, was born a year earlier, on March 8, 1799. When James was eight years old, the family moved to Northumberland County, Pennsylvania where his father died within the year at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. His mother was left with eight children and without means of support. Simon and James thus had to make their way in the world at an early age.
On his forty-seventh birthday, Cameron has been quoted as having said he had been a cow-boy, a plough-boy, a collier, a blacksmith, a tanner, a tailor, a printer, a brewer, a contractor, an alderman, a superintendent of railroads, a lawyer, a prosecuting attorney, and an aide to the governor. At age 19, James went to work in the same print shop with his brother Simon. He became editor of the "Lycoming Gazette" in 1824 and of the "Political Sentinel" in Lancaster, Pennsylvania in 1827. He studied law in the office of future President James Buchanan before turning to government contracting.
Cameron married a widow, the former Rebecca (Lemon) Galbraith, in 1829. He was superintendent of motive power on the Columbia Railroad in 1839. In 1843, he became deputy attorney general of the Lancaster, Pennsylvania mayor's court.
In 1847, Cameron accompanied Pennsylvania troops to the Mexican-American War as a sutler. He later became a colonel in the Pennsylvania militia. After the war, he practiced law, was superintendent of the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad and became a farmer on a large property.
By the time the Civil War began, Cameron was in retirement at an estate on the banks of the Susquehanna River according to some sources while at least one reference states he was superintendent of the Northern Central Railway at Sunbury, Pennsylvania.
American Civil War service.
At the outset of the Civil War, James Cameron decided to serve as a matter of duty and he proceeded to Washington, D.C. The 79th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, known as the "Highlanders" because its initial core militia companies were composed mostly of Scotsmen or men of Scottish descent, was one of the earlier units to arrive in Washington, D.C. after President Lincoln called for troops to suppress the rebellion. Having arrived under the command of its lieutenant colonel, the 79th offered the position of colonel to James Cameron, a prominent man of Scottish descent and brother of Simon Cameron, the Secretary of War. At least two sources suggest that Simon Cameron's influence played a part in the selection. James Cameron accepted the position of colonel of the regiment on June 20, 1861. By the time the regiment had filled its ranks, a majority of the men were not of Scottish background and in fact, many were of Irish heritage.
On July 7, 1861, the 79th New York Infantry moved to Virginia as Major General Irvin McDowell began the advance of the Union Army that would lead to the First Battle of Bull Run. The regiment was in the division of Brigadier General Daniel Tyler and the brigade of Colonel William T. Sherman. On July 18, 1861, Tyler's division and the 79th New York Infantry participated in a reconnaissance in force in which the regiment came under fire and where the Union force was unable to penetrate the Confederate line at the Battle of Blackburn's Ford.
One account of the 79th New York Infantry going into battle on Henry House Hill, where Confederate forces had started to rally, at a critical point in the First Battle of Bull Run states that Colonel Cameron was on the right side of the regiment's line and shouted "Come on, my brave Highlanders" as the line advanced. Other sources say he shouted: "Scots, follow me." A private in the 79th New York Infantry, William Todd, wrote that as the regiment was half way up the hill, they were hit by a volley from the Confederates that staggered them. At this point, with reference to Cameron, Confederate Colonel, later Lieutenant General, Wade Hampton III reportedly said: "Isn't terrible to see that brave officer trying to lead his men forward and they won't follow him." Cameron continued to inspire his men with his bravery in leading charges in an effort to recover Union batteries lost on Henry House Hill. Reforming at the direction of their officers after having been first repulsed, the regiment proceeded only to be hit by another volley that killed Colonel Cameron and inflicted additional casualties. Thus, Colonel James Cameron, brother of U.S. Secretary of War Simon Cameron, was killed during the first major battle of the Civil War, the First Battle of Bull Run. Simon Cameron had been among the crowd of spectators who came out from Washington, D.C. to witness the battle.
From the earliest reports after the battle, a story emerged that Wade Hampton himself had targeted officers of the 79th New York Infantry, mistaking it for the 69th New York Infantry, one of whom had killed his nephew early in the battle, and that Hampton killed Colonel Cameron with his second or a later shot at him. At least two sources note the similarity between Cameron's death and the death of Lieutenant Colonel Philips Cameron of the regiment's namesake regiment, the 79th Regiment of Foot (Cameron Highlanders) by being shot by the colonel of a French regiment at the Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro on May 5, 1811 during the Napoleonic Wars.
Following Colonel Cameron's death, after some hesitancy about firing on men who might be part of the Union force, the 79th New York Infantry was hit with another volley which caused the remaining men in the decimated force to retreat. The 79th New York Infantry "Highlanders" had sustained casualties of 32 killed, 51 wounded and 115 missing. Hampton's Legion and the 5th Virginia Infantry fought off attacks by four Union regiments, including the 79th New York Infantry, within forty minutes. Confederate Colonel Wade Hampton sustained slight head and ankle wounds during the charge of the 79th New York Infantry and while lying near the Henry House, tried to direct his men through messages carried by staff officers. Hampton's stand allowed Stonewall Jackson's brigade to have enough time to reach that critical spot on the battlefield.
Aftermath.
Although his men first carried Cameron's body to the rear, his body was left on the field by the retreating Union force and was buried near the Dogan house. Confederate commander, then Brigadier General P.G.T. Beauregard refused entreaties from Cameron's family and friends for permission to recover his body which was buried within the Confederate lines. Only after the Union Army took control of the area in 1862 was the family able to locate his grave, identify and recover his remains and have them re-interred in Lewisburg Cemetery at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.

"In a Heartbeat" is a single by Singaporean artiste Sylvia Ratonel. The song was commissioned as the official theme song to the national day parade of 2011. The song is one of the few national day parade themes that doesn't mentions, ""Singapore"" in its lyrics.
Music video.
Directed by, Brian Gothong Tan, it is the first NDP music video to not feature the performer in it. As with Song for Singapore's music video, it tells the life story of "Mother" and "Son" from his childhood years till being a father to "Grandson". The short film opens with "Mother" sewing a sarong for one of her neighbors as son goes fishing for guppies. A few days later, both "Mother" and "Son" move out of their Kampung ("Village" in Malay). The time period eventually shifts to the 70's when "Son" serves his national service and later to the 80's when he gets married. In the 90's "Grandson" is born to the couple. The video instantly shifts back to previous "memories" from the film before it ends with photographs of "Son" and his family.
Parody.
Just four weeks after the release of the music video, Singaporean blogger Lee Kin Mun (popularly known as "Mr Brown") made an a cappella rendition of the song (as with What Do You See) in response to the "Fun Pack song" that was originally part of the NDP early performance segment. The song was removed in the following performances, due to copyright claims from Universal Music and rage from the public as the song is sung to the tune of Lady Gaga's, "Bad Romance".

Dhamra is a joint stream in Odisha that is formed by the confluence of the Brahmani and Baitarani rivers south of the town of Chandabali. It lies in the Bhadrak district and empties into the Bay of Bengal. To the north of its mouth is the Dhamra Port and near the mouth is the Gahirmatha sanctuary, a nesting site for the Olive Ridley turtles.
The river mouth is as wide as 4 km and it enters the sea through two distinct river channels separated by an island formation called Kalibhanj. The two channels are further separated by another island formation in the sea called Kanika Sands which is approximately 8 km wide.
The Bhitarkanika wildlife sanctuary, famous for its estuarine crocodiles lie on the Dhamra estuary. Wheeler Island a DRDO missile launch centre is located off the mouth of the Dhamra in the Bay of Bengal.

The Water Club (restaurant)

The Water Club is an American traditional cuisine restaurant moored on a barge on the East River at East 30th Street (enter on East 23rd Street; adjacent to the FDR Drive and south of the East 34th Street Heliport) in Murray Hill, in Manhattan, New York City.
The restaurant, whose view faces Queens, serves classic American cuisine and seafood.
The restaurant is leased from the city's economic development corporation, and the rent is determined by the amount of revenue. The New York City Comptroller issued a report in 2011 alleging that the Water Club was understating its revenue by failing to record some cash sales.

Jane Lee (mountaineer)

Jane Lee Zhen Zhen (born 1984) is a mountaineer, speaker and writer from Singapore. Co-founder and co-team leader of the Singapore Women's Everest Team, Lee is also the first female from Southeast Asia and the 37th woman in history to have scaled the Seven Summits, the highest peaks of the seven continents including Mount Kilimanjaro, Denali, Elbrus, Aconcagua, Vinson and Everest (Chomolungma).
Education.
Lee studied at the National University of Singapore, graduating in 2007 with a Bachelor of Arts (English Literature) (Honours).
Seven Summits.
After successfully climbing up Mount Everest, Lee targeted the rest of the Seven Summits and promptly quit her former job as a Senior Executive at Singapore's Republic Polytechnic's Adventure Learning Centre to become a professional full-time mountaineer, securing sponsorships for her climbs from organisations such as MindChamps, an esteemed tuition centre in Singapore, Bank Julius Baer, a Swiss bank, and Khunu, a Himalayan company selling wool derived from mountain yaks in the Himalayas, at the same time.
In February 2010, Jane Lee successfully reached the peak of Australia's Mount Kosciuszko. Five months later, she climbed up Alaskan mountain McKinley. A year later, Lee ascended four mountains: Antarctica's Mount Vinson in January; Mount Aconcagua in Argentina a month later; the famed Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Africa, in June; and the Russian Mount Elbrus in July.
During her climbing of the Seven Summits, Lee was plagued by problems such as drastic snow storms, a hard landing on a runway of solid ice on Mount Vinson, experiencing five different weather conditions in Tanzania and having to elude police from Russia on Mount Elbrus, which had been sealed off due to high activity by terror groups.
Awards.
The National University of Singapore presented to Lee the "Outstanding Young Alumni Award" in 2009, in recognition of her achievements.
Personal life.
Born to Lee Hua Lam, a businessman, and Susan Sng, a sales and operations manager, in 1984, Lee is the second of three children in her household. In an interview with Singapore newspaper my paper, Lee commented on her father, saying, "My dad is a very 'outdoorsy' and adventurous person. Because of his influence, I never went to shopping malls or cinemas. " As a fan of reading, Lee enjoys indulging in the works of American author Ayn Rand, one of her favourite writers. Though strict in her personal fitness regime, Lee has admitted in an interview to "eating everything from char kway teow to McDonald's french fries and Hainanese chicken rice". In addition to conducting motivational speeches for business organisations, schools and public groups, Lee blogs on her personal website, janeclimbs.com, and for Straits Times Online Mobile Print, a Singapore webpage meant for citizen journalism.

Svedmyra

Svedmyra is a suburb in Söderort in the municipality of Stockholm, in the borough of Farsta. Svedmyra is located between Stureby and Tallkrogen, and covers about 0.92 km² of land. Svedmyra is surrounded by forests and green space. The population in 2008 was 2,812. The name "Svedmyra" comes from a cottage that was formerly on the site, named "Svinmyran", "Pig Ant". The cottage is known since the 1300s, and it belonged to Östberga farm. According to legend, Svedmyra was named after all the red forest ants in the forests around Svedmyra.
Boundaries.
Svedmyra borders Tallkrogen (in Svedmyra Forest and also in Torögatan and then in a line west of Herrhagsvägen), Gubbängen (at Tallkrogsvägen and further west in Majroskogen towards Örbyleden ), Stureby (north from Örbyleden to Grycksbo road and the metro and along the east side of the metro towards Svedmyraplan) and Gamla Enskede (along Svedmyraplan-Handelsvägen and Svedmyra Forest to a point south of Riskvägen).
History.
Until 1930, Svedmyra remained undeveloped except for a few old farms and cottages. Then streetcar line, Örbybanan, was opened between Slussen and Örby with a stop at Svedmyra (it was formally Stureby) and the area around the cottages began to be developed.
In 1932, the plan was expanded, and extended into both parks and sports grounds. A large number of houses were built in the 1930s and 1940s. The houses were built according to standard house plans, most signed Edwin Engstrom at the municipal agency. Those who had little money on their own could borrow up to 90% of construction costs.
In the 1940s, demand for housing increased, and in 1944 three-storey slab blocks were planned. 1947–1948 saw new housing built, including at Frimärksvägen and Postiljonsvägen, most of them four-storey buildings. The houses were designed in HSB's architectural office of Curt Strehlenert, developer at AB Family Housing. The facades are covered by lime - or "terrasitputs" and ceilings are made of brick. One of the houses on Postiljonsvägen holds a business.
The 1944 town plan was expanded, and the first half of the 1950s slab blocks were built, tower blocks and small houses in the woods east of Enskedevägen. Many houses were designed by Nils Lindberg and Bengt Karlsson.

<doc id="36557195" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36557195" title="Roger of Torre Maggiore">
Roger of Torre Maggiore

Roger of Torre Maggiore or Master Roger (1205 in Torre Maggiore – April 14, 1266 in Split) was a prelate of Italian origin active in the Kingdom of Hungary in the middle of the 13th century. He was archbishop of Split in Dalmatia from 1249 until his death. His "Epistle to the Sorrowful Lament upon the Destruction of the Kingdom of Hungary by the Tatars" is an important source of the Mongol invasion of the Kingdom of Hungary in 1241 and 1242.
Early life.
According to archdeacon Thomas of Split, Roger was "from a town called "Turris Cepia" in the region of Benevento", that has been identified with Torre Maggiore in Apulia in Italy. He arrived in the Kingdom of Hungary in the retinue of Cardinal Giacomo di Pecorari, a papal legate sent to King Andrew II of Hungary in 1232. Although he received the prebend of a chaplainship, and later of the archedeacon in the cathedral chapter of the Diocese of Oradea in the kingdom, he were in the company of Cardinal Giacomo in Italy between 1236 and 1239.
"Sorrowful Lament".
Master Roger appeared to have stayed in Oradea when the town was captured by the Mongols who had invaded the kingdom from the east. He fled from the town, "ran away into the forest and hid there as long as" he could. Next Master Roger arrived in Cenad, but it had also been devasteted by the invaders. However, he was soon captured by the Mongols, and he only managed to escape when the invaders were withdrawing from Hungary in 1242.
He went to Rome where he received the post of archdeacon of Sopron in the western part of the Kingdom of Hungary, because Oradea had completely been destroyed by the Mongols. He took over his new post in the town in 1243, and set about recording his experiences under the Mongol invasion to a letter written to Cardinal Giacomo. His letter provides a "dramatic description of the events" (Florin Curta) leading to the destruction of the kingdom. Following the death of Cardinal Giacomo in 1244, Master Roger was employed by Cardinal John of Toledo. When he accompanied his new master to the First Council of Lyon in 1245, he was already a canon in the diocese of Zagreb.
Archbishop of Split.
Master Roger was appointed archbishop of Split by Pope Innocent IV after the death of Archbishop Ugrin who had died on April 30, 1249. However, both the canons of the cathedral chapter and the locals would have preferred a Dominican monk named John. Finally, King Béla IV of Hungary, the supreme lord of the town approved the appointment of Roger, who arrived in his seat in February, 1250. 
During his more than fifteen years of archbishopric, he was time to time involved in conflicts both with his flock and with the monarch. In his last years, Archbishop Roger suffered from gout that also paralyzed him. He was buried in the Cathedral of Saint Domnius.

Nambija mine disaster

The Nambija mine disaster was a landslide which occurred in a remote mining settlement in the southeastern part of Ecuador on 9 May 1993. A part of the mountain above the countless mines gave way and buried about 300 people. A definite number will never be known, since there are no records about the number of people living or working in Nambija.
Location and slide.
The Nambija mining settlement is located in the southeastern part of Ecuador, high up in the mountains, in Zamora-Chinchipe Province, about 30 km east of Zamora, close to the Peruvian border. It can only be reached after a three-hour drive over a rough gravel road, which was only built in 1986. The town itself is situated in a valley, 2600m above sea level, built on the steep slopes of the mountains. Most of the houses are built right on the tunnel entrances to the mines, made from corrugated iron and tin. The mountains are riddled with adits and holes. The air is damp and full of toxic fumes from the mining process, making Nambija one of the most inhospitable places on earth. Torrential rains during the days before the disaster, softening the soil even more, made things worse.
Nambija has the title of being "The World's Most Dangerous Gold Town". This is due to the fact that violence and crime rate were very high, understandably, if you consider 10.000 people living on a patch of land about 1 square km in size. Working and living conditions played a role in this title, too. Every family had their own mine, mine shafts were hitting other mines, even basic principles of static went unobserved.
Thus, the mountains around Nambija were virtually hollow by 1990, and experts warned that further mining would drastically increase the probability of a landslide. Also, the vibrations from the huge rock crushing plant in the center of the town were a cause for fear.
Then, on the afternoon of May 9 1993, Mother's Day, a large part of the mountain at the end of the valley, above the mines and part of the town, collapsed. About 80 homes were destroyed, with an estimated 200-250 people living in them. A lot of the homes doubled as entrance shacks to the mines, and people working in there were buried. Rescue operations were difficult, since the site is so hard to reach. For the people there though, the disaster is just a part of their daily life. In the unaffected parts of the settlement, mining went on.
Casualties.
A reliable number of casualties is nowhere to be found, and probably never will. Early estimates told of about 80 people being killed, later numbers went as high as 400. The location of the slide, clearly visible even today, is an official graveyard, and many of the people buried in the disaster still lie under the mountain. Since no one knows the number of people living and working in Nambija at any given time, an accurate account of the people killed is impossible. Still, apart from the catastrophic living and working conditions, the events of this single day represent one of the worst mining disasters ever, and remain virtually unknown due to the remoteness of the site.

Ašelice (; or "Aschletz") is a remote abandoned settlement in the Municipality of Semič in southern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. Its territory is now part of the village of Mašelj. Ašelice lies high on a slope alongside an unpaved road east of Črmošnjice.
Name.
The name "Aschelitz" is believed to be derived from German "Aschnitz", a name for the herb lady's mantle, thus referring to the local vegetation. However, other sources state that the name is of Slovene origin.
History.
Ašelice was one of only three Gottschee German villages mentioned in the land registers of the Dominion of Mihovo in 1603 and 1623. However, it was not included in the land registry of 1770. The village consisted of eight houses and 29 inhabitants in 1931, and 37 inhabitants in 1937. The Gottschee Germans were evicted from the village in the fall of 1941. Italian troops burned the village during the Rog Offensive in 1942.

<doc id="36557254" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36557254" title="Comatulida">
Comatulida

Comatulida is an order of crinoids. Members of this order are known as feather stars and, unlike the majority of crinoids, do not have a stalk as adults. The oral surface with the mouth is facing upwards and is surrounded by five, often divided rays with feathery pinnules. Comatulids live on the seabed and on reefs in tropical and temperate waters.
Characteristics.
Like other echinoids, comatulids have pentamerous symmetry as adults though the larvae have bilateral symmetry. Late in their development, the larvae are attached to the seabed by a stalk, but this is broken at metamorphosis and the juvenile crinoid is free living. The body has an endoskeleton made from a number of articulated calcareous plates known as ossicles covered by a thin epidermis. It is in the shape of a cup (the calyx) with a lid (the tegmen) which has a central mouth and an anus near the edge, the gut being U-shaped. There is a ring of clawlike appendages (the cirri) near the base of the aboral underside; these grip the substrate to keep the feather star in place.
There are five long, often branched, rays attached round the edge of the tegmen. Each of these is further subdivided into branchlets (the pinnules). Most comatulids originally have 10 arms, each ray being subdivided once. The arms are fragile, and if one is broken off, at least two grow in its place; in this way the number of arms can increase. The arms are composed of articulating ossicles held together by ligaments, and the pinnules have a similar structure. The arms are very flexible and can be spread widely or coiled up. An ambulacral groove starts on each pinnule and joins with others to form grooves on the arms all leading to grooves on the tegmen ending at the mouth. These food-collecting grooves are overhung by calcareous plates (the lappets) and have a lining of fine cilia.
Behaviour.
Many comatulids live in crevices, under corals or inside sponges, the only visible part being some of the arms. Some come out at night and perch themselves on eminences to feed. Many species can "walk" across the seabed, raising their body on their arms. Many can also swim with their arms but most are largely sedentary, seldom moving far from their chosen place of concealment.
Feeding.
Comatulids are suspension feeders. The arms are extended and held in such a position as to maximise the feeding surface with regard to the current. At each junction of the ossicles in the pinnules there are a group of three suckerless tube feet. The longest of these searches for plankton in the surrounding water. When a particle is found, it is gathered in and thrust into the ambulacral groove by all three tube feet. Here it is formed into a bolus with mucus and moved down to the mouth by the actions of the cilia, being retained in the groove by the lappets.
Reproduction.
Comatulids are dioecious, each individual being either male or female. The gametes are produced in specialised pinnules at the base of the arms, and fertilisation is external. The larvae are planktonic and drift with the water flow. After several larval stages they settle on the seabed and anchor themselves with a stalk. At metamorphosis, the stalk breaks and the juveniles can move around.
Ecology.
Comatulids consist of 80% calcium carbonate and are unappetising to most predators. A number of species of fish are known to feed on them, usually pulling off a single arm or the visceral mass, both of which can be regenerated. 47% of specimens seen by one researcher were lacking one or more arms or had regenerating limbs, so sub-lethal predation is probably low. Many other invertebrates live as commensals among the rays of crinoids and it may be these succulent morsels that are the principal objective of most predators. The comatulid "Florometra serratissima", in the north east Pacific, has been reported as being preyed on by the graceful decorator crab "Oregonia gracilis" and the sunflower seastar "Pycnopodia helianthoides". The loss of the arms may be due to autotomy, the shedding of an arm to save the rest of the organism. A arm was found to be fully regenerated in nine months in this species.
Order Comatulida.
The World Register of Marine Species includes the following suborders, superfamilies and families in Comatulida:

Regular tuning

Among alternative guitar-tunings, regular tunings have equal musical intervals between the paired notes of their successive open strings. Regular tunings help beginning students to learn the fretboard's notes and chords. Regular tunings also facilitate improvisation by advanced guitarists.
"Guitar tunings" assign pitches to the open strings of guitars. Tunings can be described by the particular pitches that are denoted by notes in Western music. By convention, the notes are ordered from lowest to highest. The "standard tuning" defines the string pitches as E, A, D, G, B, and E. Between the open-strings of the standard tuning are three perfect-fourths (E-A, A-D, D-G), then the major third G-B, and the fourth perfect-fourth B-E.
In contrast, regular tunings have constant intervals between their successive open-strings:
For the regular tunings, chords may be moved "diagonally" around the fretboard, indeed "vertically" for the repetitive regular tunings (minor thirds, major thirds, and augmented fourths). Regular tunings thus appeal to new guitarists and also to jazz-guitarists, whose improvisation is simplified. On the other hand, some conventional chords are easier to play in standard tuning than in regular tuning than in standard tuning. Left-handed guitarists may use the chord charts from one class of regular tunings for its left-handed tuning; for example, the chord charts for all-fifths tuning may be used for guitars strung with left-handed all-fourths tuning.
The class of regular tunings has been named and described by Professor William Sethares. Sethares's 2001 chapter "Regular tunings" (in his revised 2010-2011 "Alternate tuning guide") is the leading source for this article. This article's descriptions of particular regular-tunings use other sources also.

Standard tuning has the following open-string notes:
In standard tuning, the separation of the second (b), and third (g) string is by a major-third interval, which has a width of four semitones.
The irregularity has a price. Chords cannot be shifted around the fretboard in the standard tuning E-A-D-G-B-E, which requires four chord-shapes for the major chords. There are separate chord-forms for chords having their root note on the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth strings.
Alternative.
"Alternative ("alternate")" tuning refers to any open-string note-arrangement other than standard tuning. Such alternative tuning arrangements offer different chord voicing and sonorities. Alternative tunings necessarily change the chord shapes associated with standard tuning, which eases the playing of some non-standard chords at the cost of increasing the difficulty of some standard chords. Regular tunings benefit from re-stringing of the guitar with different gauges. In particular, all-fifths tuning has been difficult to implement on conventional guitars; even an approximation to all-fifths tuning, new standard tuning, has required special sets of strings.
Properties.
With standard tuning, and with all tunings, chord patterns can be moved twelve frets down, where the notes repeat in a higher octave.
For the standard tuning, there is exactly one interval of a third between the second and third strings, and all the other intervals are fourths. Working around the irregular third of standard tuning, guitarists have to memorize chord-patterns for at least three regions: The first four strings tuned in perfect fourths; two or more fourths and the third; and one or more initial fourths, the third, and the last fourth.
In contrast, "regular" tunings have equal intervals between the strings.
In contrast, regular tunings have constant intervals between their successive open-strings. In fact, the class of each regular tuning is characterized by its musical interval as shown by the following list:
The regular tunings whose number of semi-tones "s" divides 12 (the number of notes in the octave) repeat their open-string notes (raised one octave) after 12/"s" strings: For example,
Regular tunings have symmetrical scales all along the fretboard. This makes it simpler to translate chords. For the regular tunings, chords may be moved diagonally around the fretboard.
The shifting of chords is especially simple for the regular tunings that repeat their open strings, in which case chords can be moved vertically: Chords can be moved three strings up (or down) in major-thirds tuning, and chords can be moved two strings up (or down) in augmented-fourths tuning. Regular tunings thus appeal to new guitarists and also to jazz-guitarists, whose improvisation is simplified by regular intervals.
Particular conventional-chords are more difficult to play.
On the other hand, particular chords are more difficult to play in a regular tuning than in standard tuning. It can be difficult to play conventional chords especially in augmented-fourths tuning and all-fifths tuning,
in which the wide (tritone and perfect-fifth) intervals require hand stretching. Some chords, which are conventional in folk music, are difficult to play even in all-fourths and major-thirds tunings, which do not require more hand-stretching than standard tuning.
On the other hand,
minor-thirds tuning
features many barre chords with repeated notes, properties that appeal to acoustic guitarists and to beginners.
Frets covered by the hand.
The chromatic scale climbs from one string to the next after a number of frets that is specific to each regular tuning. The chromatic scale climbs after exactly four frets in major-thirds tuning, so reducing the extensions of the little and index fingers ("hand stretching"). For other regular tunings, the successive strings have intervals that are minor thirds, perfect fourths, augmented fourths, or perfect fifths; thus, the fretting hand covers three, five, six, or seven frets respectively to play a chromatic scale. (Of course, the highest chromatic-scale uses the open strings and so requires one less fret to be covered.)
Examples.
The following regular-tunings are discussed by Sethares, who also mentions other regular tunings that are difficult to play or have little musical interest.
Minor thirds.
In each minor-thirds (m3) tuning, every interval between successive strings is a minor third. Thus each repeats its open-notes after four strings.
In the minor-thirds tuning beginning with C, the open strings contain the notes (c, e, g) of the diminished C triad.
Minor-thirds tuning
features many barre chords with repeated notes,
properties that appeal to acoustic guitarists and to beginners.
Doubled notes
have different sounds
because of differing "string widths, tensions and tunings,
and the doubled notes --> reinforce each other,
like the doubled strings of a twelve string guitar
add chorusing and depth,"
according to William Sethares.

"Major-thirds tuning" is a regular tuning in which the musical intervals between successive strings are each major thirds. Like minor-thirds tuning (and unlike all-fourths and all-fifths tuning), major-thirds tuning is a repetitive tuning; it repeats its octave after three strings, which again simplifies the learning of chords and improvisation; similarly, minor-thirds tuning repeats itself after four strings while augmented-fourths tuning repeats itself after two strings.
Neighboring the standard tuning is the all-thirds tuning that has the open strings
With six strings, major-thirds tuning has a smaller range than standard tuning; with seven strings, the major-thirds tuning covers the range of standard tuning on six strings. With the repetition of three open-string notes, each major-thirds tuning provides the guitarist with many options for fingering chords. Indeed, the fingering of two successive frets suffices to play pure major and minor chords, while the fingering of three successive frets suffices to play seconds, fourths, sevenths, and ninths.
For the standard Western guitar, which has six strings, major-thirds tuning has a smaller range than standard tuning; on a guitar with "seven" strings, the major-thirds tuning covers the range of standard tuning on "six" strings. Even greater range is possible with guitars with "eight" strings.
Major-thirds tuning was introduced in 1964 by the American jazz-guitarist Ralph Patt to facilitate improvisation.
All fourths.
This tuning is like that of the lowest four strings in standard tuning. Consequently, of all the regular tunings, it is the closest approximation to standard tuning, and thus it best allows the transfer of a knowledge of chords from standard tuning to a regular tuning. Jazz musician Stanley Jordan plays guitar in all-fourths tuning; he has stated that all-fourths tuning "simplifies the fingerboard, making it logical".
</ref>
For all-fourths tuning, all twelve major chords (in the first or open positions) are generated by two chords, the open F major chord and the D major chord. The regularity of chord-patterns reduces the number of finger positions that need to be memorized.
The left-handed involute of an all-fourths tuning is an all-fifths tuning. All-fourths tuning is based on the perfect fourth (five semitones), and all-fifths tuning is based on the perfect fifth (seven semitones). Consequently, chord charts for all-fifths tunings may be used for left-handed all-fourths tuning.
Augmented fourths.
Between the all-fifths and all-fourths tunings are "augmented-fourth" tunings, which are also called ""diminished-fifths"" or ""tritone"" tunings. It is a repetitive tuning that repeats its notes after two strings. With augmented-fourths tunings, the fretboard has greatest symmetry. In fact, every augmented-fourths tuning lists the notes of all the other augmented-fourths tunings on the frets of its fretboard. Professor Sethares wrote that
"The augmented-fourth interval is the only
interval whose inverse is the same as itself. The
augmented-fourths tuning is the only tuning (other
than the 'trivial' tuning C-C-C-C-C-C) for which all
chords-forms remain unchanged when the strings
are reversed. Thus the augmented-fourths tuning is
its own 'lefty' tuning."
Of all the augmented-fourths tunings, the C-F-c-f-c'-f ' tuning is the closest approximation to the standard tuning, and its fretboard is displayed next:
An augmented-fourths tuning "makes it very easy for playing half-whole scales, diminished 7 licks, and whole tone scales," stated guitarist Ron Jarzombek.
All fifths: "Mandoguitar".
All-fifths tuning is a tuning in intervals of perfect fifths like that of a mandolin, cello or violin; other names include "perfect fifths" and "fifths". Consequently, classical compositions written for violin or guitar may be adapted to all-fifths tuning more easily than to standard tuning.
When he was asked whether tuning in fifths facilitates "new intervals or harmonies that aren't readily available in standard tuning", Robert Fripp responded, "It's a more rational system, but it's also better sounding—better for chords, better for single notes." To build chords, Fripp uses "perfect intervals in fourths, fifths and octaves", so avoiding minor thirds and especially major thirds, which are sharp in equal temperament tuning (in comparison to thirds in just intonation). It is a challenge to adapt conventional guitar-chords to new standard tuning, which is based on all-fifths tuning.</ref> Some closely voiced jazz chords become impractical in NST and all-fifths tuning.
It has a wide range, thus its implementation can be difficult. The high "b" requires a taut, thin string, and consequently is prone to breaking. This can be ameliorated by using a shorter scale length guitar, by shifting to a different key, or by shifting down a fifth.
The left-handed involute of an all-fifths tuning is an all-fourths tuning. All-fifths tuning is based on the perfect fifth (seven semitones), and all-fourths tuning is based on the perfect fourth (five semitones). Consequently, chord charts for all-fifths tunings are used for left-handed all-fourths tuning.
New standard tuning.
All-fifths tuning has been approximated with tunings that avoid the high b' or the low C. The b' has been replaced with a g' in the new standard tuning (NST) of King Crimson's Robert Fripp. The original version of NST was all-fifths tuning. However, in the 1980s, Fripp never attained the all fifth's high b'. While he could attain a', the string's life-time distribution was too short. Experimenting with a g string, Fripp succeeded. "Originally, seen in 5ths. all the way, the top string would not go to B. so, as on a tenor banjo, I adopted an A on the first string. These kept breaking, so G was adopted." In 2012, Fripp experimented with A String (0.007); if successful, the experiment could lead to "the NST 1.2", CGDAE-A, according to Fripp. Fripp's NST has been taught in Guitar Craft courses. Guitar Craft and its successor Guitar Circle have taught Fripp's tuning to three-thousand students.
Extreme intervals.
For regular tunings, intervals wider than a perfect fifth or narrower than a minor third have limited interest.
Wide intervals.
Two regular-tunings based on sixths, having intervals of minor sixths (eight semitones) and of major sixths (nine semitones), have received scholarly discussion. The chord charts for minor-sixths tuning are useful for left-handed guitarists playing in major-thirds tuning; the chord charts for major-sixths tuning, for left-handed guitarists playing in minor-thirds tuning.
The regular tunings with minor-seventh (ten semitones) or major-seventh (eleven semitones) intervals would make chord-playing very difficult, as would octave intervals.
Narrow intervals.
The regular-tunings that have as their intervals either zero semi-tones (unison), one semi-tone (minor second), or two semi-tones (major second) have little musical-interest, because it is very difficult to play chords in those tunings.
The "trivial" class of unison tunings (such as C-C-C-C-C-C) is its own left-handed tuning. Unison tunings are briefly discussed in the article on ostrich tunings. Having exactly one note, unison tunings are also ostrich tunings, which have exactly one pitch class (but may have two or more notes, for example, C, c, and c'); non-unison ostrich tunings are not regular.
Left-handed involution.
The class of regular tunings is preserved under the involution from right-handed to left-handed tunings, as observed by William Sethares. The present discussion of left-handed tunings is of interest to musical theorists, mathematicians, and left-handed persons, but may be skipped by other readers.
For left-handed guitars, the ordering of the strings reverses the ordering of the strings for right-handed guitars. For example, the left-handed involute of the standard tuning E-A-D-G-B-E is the "lefty" tuning E-B-G-D-A-E. Similarly, the "left-handed" involute of the "lefty" tuning is the standard ("righty") tuning.
The reordering of open-strings in left-handed tunings has an important consequence. The chord fingerings for the right-handed tunings must be changed for left-handed tunings. However, the left-handed involute of a regular tuning is easily recognized: it is another regular tuning. Thus the chords for the involuted regular-tuning may be used for the left-handed involute of a regular tuning.
For example, the left-handed version of all-fourths tuning is all-fifths tuning, and the left-handed version of all-fifths tuning is all-fourths tuning. In general, the left-handed involute of the regular tuning based on the interval with formula_1 semitones is the regular tuning based on its involuted interval with formula_2 semitones: All-fourths tuning is based on the perfect fourth (five semitones), and all-fifths tuning is based on the perfect fifth (seven semitones), as mentioned previously. The following table summarizes the lefty-righty pairings discussed by Sethares.
The left-handed involute of a left-handed involute is the original right-handed tuning. The left-handed version of the trivial tuning C-C-C-C-C-C is also C-C-C-C-C-C. Among non-trivial tunings, only the class of augmented-fourths tunings is fixed under the lefty involution.
Summary.
The principal regular-tunings have their properties summarized in the following table:

Hydraform International

The Hydraform Interlocking Soil Block is an interlocking building block used in many African countries for construction purposes. The Hydraform block is made from a mixture of soil, cement and water. The mix is hydraulically compressed to form a high quality interlocking soil block. Soil from the building site can be used to manufacture building blocks.
The Hydraform compressed earth block is very popular due to the cost savings that are invloved during the construction process as only around 30% of the structure requires mortar between the blocks. Due to the interlocking nature of the stabilized soil block, unskilled labour can be utilised in construction thereby empowering rural communities and creating jobs.
The blocks interlock top to bottom and front to back. Blocks dimensions are 220mm wide, 115mm high and 230mm long. It weighs approxamitely 12 kg. Once blocks are manufactured it is "wet cured" for a period of 14 – 21 days to reach desired strength.

Starološki Grič

Starološki Grič (; , Gottscheerish: "Autlogpichl" or "Lockpiechl") is a remote abandoned settlement in the Municipality of Semič in southern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. Its territory is now part of the village of Planina.
Name.
The name of the village is also recorded as "Lackh Püchel" and "Logbichl" in old land registries, and was known as "Autlogpichl", "Lockpiechl", or "Logpichl" in the Gottschee German dialect. The designation "Staro-/Alt-" 'old' distinguished the settlement from the nearby younger settlement of Novološki Grič (). Both the Slovene name and German names literally mean '(old) hill near a marshy meadow'. Slovene place names containing the word "grič" 'small hill' are relatively common and may historically refer to elevations rising over 100 meters.
History.
The land registries of 1574 and 1770 indicate that Starološki Grič consisted of one hide and four houses, with a population of six landowners and 12 to 15 residents altogether. In 1817 the village still had four houses and its population was 26. The village was abandoned by the end of the 19th century due to emigration to the United States. It was sold off to the Auersperg noble family in the 1890s to provide housing for their forestry workers. The abandoned village burned before the First World War.
Cultural heritage.
The entire former village site is registered as cultural heritage, including ruins of buildings, a well, outlines of overgrown fields, and the remains of a linden-tree avenue. The ruins of the 16th-century village Chapel of Saint Ulrich are also registered as cultural heritage. This was a single-nave building with a narrow single-bay octagonal chancel walled on five sides. The remnants of a carved travertine arch and a narrow window in the chancel show that the chapel was built in the Gothic style.

Lyceum of the Principality of Serbia

The Lyceum of the Principality of Serbia was the first higher education school in Serbia in which education was taught in Serbian. It was founded in 1838 on the initiative of Prince Miloš Obrenović II in Kragujevac. When Belgrade became the Serbian capital city in 1841, the Serbian Lyceum was moved to it. In 1863 it was transformed into the Higher School.
Initially, lyceum had only philosophical and legal departments. In 1845 lyceum received the first instruments from Vuk Marinković. Departments for natural and technical sciences were founded in 1853 and included department for chemistry which is considered as nucleus of the Faculty of Chemistry at Belgrade University. Laboratory of the chemistry department was in the basement of the Princess Ljubica's Residence.
Students.
There were 21 students in the first generation and 17 of them finished the studies. In the first period there were only between 20 and 30 students in each generation. Many students were not able to complete their studies and left because of financial or health problems. After the graduation some of them received government's scholarship to continue their education abroad. They were obliged to work-off received scholarship by working for the government afterwards.
The first student organisation in Serbia, Association of Serbian Youth (), was established in this lyceum in 1847, but it was soon banned because of their criticism of the Defenders of the Constitution.

Stari Tabor

Stari Tabor (; , Gottscheerish: "Autrtawr" or "Aotrtawr") is a remote abandoned settlement in the Municipality of Semič in southern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. Its territory is now part of the village of Brezovica pri Črmošnjicah.
Geography.
Stari Tabor was located on a slope above the Črmošnjica Valley south of Brezovica pri Črmošnjicah, ranging in elevation between 606 and 620 meters. There is a spring near the site of the village.
Name.
The German name of the village, "Alttabor", semantically corresponds to Slovene "Stari Tabor", literally 'old fortified camp'. "Tabor" 'fortified camp' is a relatively common element in Slovene place names and refers to a fortified area, usually on a hilltop but sometimes also narrow valleys or cliffs with caves, where the population could withdraw to shelter from Ottoman raids. The word "tabor" itself was borrowed into Slovene partially via German (cf. late Middle High German "taber"), but is ultimately of Turkish origin, from "tabur" 'battalion (prepared for defense)' (cf. also Chagatai "tapkur" 'fortress'). Some scholars have characterized the German name "Alttabor" as a Slovene-German hybrid.
History.
Stari Tabor was not yet mentioned in the land registry of 1574, and so it probably developed later as a settlement founded under the Counts of Blagay. The village developed from a fortified camp built as protection against Ottoman raids. An 18th-century military map mentions only a deteriorating fortification at the site. In 1770 it had nine houses, but only one by 1931. The village reached its peak population of 43 in 1880, but by 1921 it no longer had any permanent residents. In 1936 five of the six houses in the village were in ruins, and a German family of five was living in one house. The remaining six inhabitants—the Johann Tramposch family—were evicted from the village on 10 December 1941; the sole house was burned by Italian troops during the Rog Offensive in August 1942. The entire site of the former village is registered as cultural heritage. The ruins of two structures remain.

Bardou, Hérault

Bardou, Hérault is a small village located in the Hérault departement in the Languedoc-Roussillon region of France. The hamlet is located in the municipality of Mons, Hérault in the canton Olargues.
Geography.
Bardou is situated on the edge of the Massif Central mountain range, part of the Monts de l’Espinouse, in the Natural Regional Park of Upper Languedoc. The nearest town in the east is Bédarieux (28 km), in the south is Béziers (39 km) and in the west is Saint-Pons-de-Thomières (33 km).
History.
Middle ages.
There are no historic records of the foundation of the hamlet. The oldest houses still existing were probably built in the 15th century.
17th til 19th century.
The oldest records originate from a population census in 1785. By that time 79 persons were living in 14 households in the village. In the following millennium the number of the population changed only slightly, reaching its peak in 1865 when 89 persons lived in Bardou. In 1901 a school was opened where 15 children were instructed some of which came from the neighboring village of Héric or the nearby farm of Le Sécadou.
20th century.
The First World War changed the population structure substantially. The men went to the front and the women were not able to maintain the agriculture. After 1918 the returning veterans found poor living conditions, the village was haunted by famine and disease. Young people, in particular, left Bardou to seek work and better living conditions in larger villages and towns. When the dirt road to the Valley of Le Pradal was built in 1924 the majority of the population of Bardou used it to leave the village. By 1925 there were only six households left in Bardou. By 1967 only a single man was left, Achille Bonnét.
In 1967, however, the German, Klaus Erhardt, and the American, Jeane Rauch, purchased most of the dilapidated hamlet and revived the village.
Klaus and Jean.
The couple Klaus Erhardt, (born 17 September 1934 in Hannover, died 20 July 2009 in Bardou) and Jean Rauch (born 21 December 1930) had spent several years traveling before they decided, in 1966, to settle down with Jean's four children in the South of France. They first lived in a big house in Le Lau a hamlet in the community of Vieussan. Later they learned about an almost abandoned village above Mons-la-Trivalle - Bardou. They quickly made the decision to move from Le Lau to this place.
Bardou at that time consisted of 20 ramschackle house which were mainly overgrown by trees, shrubbery and ivy. Achille Bonnet, the last resident of the hamlet owned 40% of the area the other 60% were distributed to more than 100 partial owner. These owners thought Ernhardt and Rauch were crazy and were eager to sell their property, unable to imagine living Bardou themselves. Due to the large number of owners who wanted to sell the negotiations were protracted over several months. By the beginning of 1968, Klaus Erhardt owned most of the buildings in Bardou as well as 110 acres of the surrounding land. An additional 190 acres were “Mazade”—this land was common land for farming by all inhabitants. Over the next few years, the new owners excavated and restored the buildings and roads of Bardou. After the first few houses were inhabitable guests began to arrive to spend their holidays there. Many of them stayed for months to help rebuild the village and piece by piece, the houses were restored and rented out. Friends of the family also came regularly to Bardou and stayed for extended periods to help with the project. Some of the houses were named after those who assisted in the rebuild.
Initially there were no sewage systems, water lines, telephone lines or electricity. The access road was no more than a dirt track which had to be cleared of brush and stone. By 1969 more than half of the road was paved, but the last 1.4 km remained in poor condition until the end of the 1980s. It was not until 1994 that Bardou was connected to the French electricity grid. A telephone connection has been available since the late 1970s. However, the village still has no water supply. Drinking water is collected from natural springs in the vicinity. The waste water is collected over the year, fermented and dispersed via a sewage irrigation field. Some of the houses still do not have power and water today. There are several outhouses on the outskirts of the village and in the centre of the village there is now a bath house with two showers and water toilets for guests.
Klaus Erhardt died on 20 July 2009 in Bardou. Jean Erhardt and her daughter, Elizabeth Erhardt-Nolan continue to reside in Bardou. In 2010, great change came to Bardou. By modernizing the tapping of the spring water and building three new drinking water reservoirs the yearly problem of dwindling drinking water reserves in the summer has been alleviated. Furthermore many houses have been significantly modernized and enhanced with cast-iron fireplaces and all the comforts of life. An unnamed building was also completed next to the concert hall.
Bardou today.
Bardou has become a popular holiday destination. In the three summer months many guests spend their holidays here. Each cottage in the village is unique, clustered together against a backdrop of chestnut trees and strutting peacocks.
Bardou has also become a place of music. The Sinfonietta (orchestra), Camerata and Chamber Orchestra are collections of young musicians who congregate here every year from all over the world to rehearse their music together. Their performances take place at the end of the season in the nearby churches, monasteries, and castles.

2004–05 Luton Town F.C. season

The 2004–05 season was the 119th season in the history of Luton Town Football Club, and club’s 84th consecutive year in The Football League. Luton ended the season as champions of the rebranded League One competition, formerly known as the Second Division, with 98 points, achieving promotion to the Championship; the club’s first elevation to that level since the 1981–82 season.
The club spent very little money bringing in new players to win the title, instead relying on existing players, use of the loan system and the robust youth set-up. Much of the success was built on a strong defence, headed by youth graduate Curtis Davies, which let in the fewest goals of any team; the leadership of combative midfielder and captain Kevin Nicholls, who unlike in previous years remained uninjured for the whole season; and the team's ability to score late goals – of the 87 goals the team scored in the league, almost a fifth came in the last ten minutes of matches.
This article covers the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005.
Background.
With Luton Town losing up to £500,000 per month and the very real threat of its history and heritage being destroyed by controversial owner John Gurney, supporters' trust Trust in Luton deliberately placed the club into administrative receivership in July 2003 after taking a controlling interest in the club's major creditor. Gurney was successfully forced out as a result, but administration meant that the club was unable to sign players without special dispensation from the authorities during the 2003–04 season and, therefore, a finish of tenth place in the league was viewed by many to be a success.
On 12 May 2004, four days after the last game of the campaign, businessman Bill Tomlins completed his takeover of the club, securing its immediate future. Manager Mike Newell began the process of keeping key players, committing defenders Chris Coyne and Russell Perrett, midfielders Paul Hughes, Michael Leary and Steve Robinson, and youth players Curtis Davies, Rob Beckwith and Stephen O'Leary to two-year contracts, as well as rejecting an offer from Sheffield Wednesday for leading scorer Steve Howard. Popular striker Adrian Forbes left the club and dropped down to the league below, signing for Swansea City on a free transfer in late June.
Review.
July.
Experienced goalkeeper Marlon Beresford returned to Luton, where he had spent three months during the previous season, on a free transfer on 1 July from Barnsley. The same day, midfielder Matthew Spring, who had started his career at Luton and made nearly 300 appearances for the team, joined Championship side Leeds United on a Bosman free transfer. On 12 July, 2003–04 Player of the Year Emmerson Boyce, another who had graduated through the youth system, turned down the offer of a new contract and joined Premier League club Crystal Palace on a free transfer. The club signed Slovenian goalkeeper Dino Seremet on a two-year contract on 23 July from NK Maribor, the player arriving on a free transfer following a successful trial period.
After five friendly victories against local sides, Luton were brought back to earth with a 4–0 home loss to Dutch champions and former European Cup winners Ajax on 23 July. Striker Matthew Blinkhorn joined Luton on a three-month loan from Blackpool a week later.
A 1–1 draw with Premier League club Charlton Athletic on 31 July rounded off pre-season, with the first league game of the campaign beginning a week later.
August.
A day before the first game with Oldham Athletic, Luton signed Portsmouth's 21-year-old striker Rowan Vine on a three-month loan, with a view to extending this for the whole season. Vine started in the team that beat Oldham 2–1 on 7 August, with goals from Steve Howard and Paul Underwood resulting in a Luton victory in an otherwise even game. Narrow, albeit high-scoring, victories away to Swindon Town and Barnsley pushed Luton into second place in the table, and marked the first time since the 1981–82 season that the club had won their first three games of a campaign.
The team kept their first clean sheet with a 1–0 win over Torquay United on 21 August that pushed them into first place. A week later, Luton won 3–1 away to Blackpool in a game they dominated, scoring three goals in the second-half to win their third away game – the same number of away wins achieved in the entirety of the previous season. Howard scored again to make it five goals in five League One games and, including the previous season, ten goals in ten consecutive games. A 1–0 home win against Bournemouth two days later, captain Kevin Nicholls scoring the winning goal late on with a 25-yard curling shot, gave Luton a six-point lead at the top of the table.
These six wins in a row saw Mike Newell presented with the Manager of the Month award, and Steve Howard awarded the Player of the Month trophy for his five goals.
September.
Youth player Keith Keane, who had played a number of games in August in place of the injured Kevin Foley, was rewarded for his performances with a two-year professional contract on 3 September. Soon after, on-loan striker Rowan Vine extended his loan until the end of the season following a strong start.
Luton's 100% record came to an end on 4 September when they drew 0–0 at Sheffield Wednesday. Three days later, the club was knocked out of the League Cup after a 4–3 extra time loss to League Two side Boston United.
Luton clearly did not dwell on either of these setbacks, winning their next three league games to extend the gap to second-placed Tranmere Rovers to nine points. In this period, the club signed striker Gary McSheffrey on a one-month loan, a player who had proved a success in a three-month loan spell the previous season. First-choice goalkeeper Marlon Beresford was injured in a 2–1 home win against Peterborough United, meaning back-up Dino Seremet made his debut as a substitute. Seremet's first start did not go so well, as Luton were knocked out of the Football League Trophy, again by lower league opposition, in a 2–0 loss to Swansea City on 28 September. Youth players Calvin Andrew and Leon Barnett both signed three-year professional contracts the same day.
A Luton player won the League One Player of the Month award for the second month in a row, Rowan Vine picking up the award after scoring three goals in four league games.
October.
An 1–1 draw away to closest rivals Tranmere Rovers on 2 October was described as "the toughest test for team yet" by Mike Newell. Following a 3–0 win against Hartlepool United six days later, the club had gone over a quarter of the league season unbeaten.
This record quickly evaporated with three defeats in a row, to Huddersfield Town, Walsall, and a heavy 3–0 loss against Hull City, who had now overtaken Tranmere as Luton's nearest rivals. Newell refused to be flustered despite dropping nine points, stating that "there isn't a lot wrong" and that bad luck had played a part in the defeats.
The injury to Marlon Beresford and poor goalkeeping performances from Dino Seremet led Luton to sign Simon Royce on a one-month loan from Charlton Athletic on 29 October. A 4–0 home win against Bradford City came one day later, with Ahmet Brković opening the scoring with a "sensational" bicycle kick.
November.
Director of Football Mick Harford left the club on 5 November to take up the post of assistant manager at Nottingham Forest.
The club remained unbeaten throughout November, winning convincingly against Wrexham and MK Dons, drawing against Doncaster Rovers, and claiming an FA Cup first round victory over Southend United.
Luton rejected a bid for Steve Howard during November from Championship side Nottingham Forest, managed by former Luton boss Joe Kinnear. Leon Barnett, who had graduated through the youth team, signed for non-League Aylesbury United on loan for a month on 19 November.
Central defender Curtis Davies became the third Luton player in four months to win the League One Player of the Month award for his performances in November.
December.
Luton secured a place in the FA Cup third round following a 3–0 win away to Wycombe Wanderers on 4 December.
Steve Howard was sent off early in Luton's game at Brentford on 7 December, with the club losing 2–0 in their fourth league defeat of the season and reducing their lead at the top of the table to just one point. However, wins against Port Vale, Bristol City, and Chesterfield allowed Luton to pull out a lead once again. The performances of squad players such as Russell Perrett and Enoch Showunmi, filling in for injuries and suspensions, were cited by Mike Newell as key to these three victories.
On 16 December, defenders David Bayliss and Ian Hillier both joined League Two side Chester City on one-month loans.
2004 ended in a 2–2 home draw with Colchester United, Rowan Vine scoring twice.
January.
Two draws in the league saw Luton usurped as league leaders by Hull City, marking the first time during the season that they had been in a place other than top since 28 August. Luton were then knocked out of the FA Cup with a 2–0 home defeat to Brentford on 8 January.
The loans of David Bayliss and Ian Hillier at Chester City were both extended for a further month on 14 January.
The club returned to the top of the table with their first win in four games, beating bottom-of-the-table Stockport County 3–0 on 15 January. Further draws with Colchester United and Tranmere Rovers still left Luton as leaders, as Hull began to drop points.
February.
Left-back Sol Davis signed a one-year contract extension on 3 February.
On 5 February, Luton drew for the third time in a row, this time with Huddersfield Town, conceding in the fourth minute of added time. A draw for Hull left them one point behind Luton in the table, with the next match taking place between the two sides at Kenilworth Road one week later. A close match was eventually won by Luton, Ahmet Brković scoring in the last minute of the game to pull out a four-point lead.
Three further wins in quick succession over Hartlepool United, Bradford City and Walsall saw this four-point gap increase to nine, and even a loss to Port Vale in late February, described by Newell as their "worst performance of the season", that ended a 14-game unbeaten league run kept Luton comfortably in first place.
March.
Luton put the defeat to Port Vale behind them with a 5–0 thrashing of Bristol City and then a 3–1 win over Swindon Town.
Influential midfielders Kevin Nicholls and Ahmet Brković both signed one-year contract extensions on 3 March. On 10 March, manager Mike Newell signed a two-year contract extension alongside his assistant manager Brian Stein. Young goalkeeper Dean Brill signed a one-year contract extension on 14 March. Two days later, Wycombe Wanderers rejected a £100,000 bid from Luton for their top scorer Nathan Tyson.
The club drew 2–2 with Oldham Athletic on 19 March, with a last-minute Steve Howard goal earning a point that saw Hull City close the gap to the top.
Northern Ireland international striker Warren Feeney signed for Luton on 24 March for a £150,000 fee from Stockport County, where he had scored 17 goals. A 3–1 defeat the next day to Barnsley, coupled with a draw for Hull, meant Luton conceded top place in the table again, though both clubs were still safely above the play-off places. A 4–1 win over Torquay United on 28 March, along with Hull losing, lifted Luton back into first.
April.
Luton went the entirety of April without losing or drawing, with consecutive victories against Blackpool, Bournemouth, MK Dons, Wrexham and Brentford securing promotion to the Championship and first place in the table; the club's first promotion to the second tier of English football since the 1981–82 season.
Chris Coyne was awarded the Player of the Month trophy for April, making him the fourth Luton player in nine months to win the accolade, while Mike Newell won the Manager of the Month award for the second time during the season.
May and June.
Luton ended the season with an incident-packed 3–3 draw with Doncaster Rovers on 7 May.
The club had six players named in the League One Team of the Year – goalkeeper Marlon Beresford; centre-backs Curtis Davies and Chris Coyne; midfielders Kevin Nicholls and Ahmet Brković; and top scorer Steve Howard. Curtis Davies was also named as the overall League One Player of the Year, a notable achievement considering this was the 20-year-old's first full season.
On 17 May, it was announced that Wrexham's Trinidadian international winger Carlos Edwards would join Luton on a free transfer on 1 July 2005, signing a three-year contract. Lee Mansell, who had played only three times during the season, joined Oxford United on a free transfer on 7 June. Steve Howard, who had been the subject of bids from Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forest and Burnley throughout the season, committed himself to Luton on 16 June by signing a new two-year contract. Midfielder Peter Holmes also agreed a one-year extension to his contract. On 30 June, defender David Bayliss left Luton to join Wrexham.

Internet Association

The Internet Association is a United States political lobbying organization based in Washington, D.C., and formed by members of the Internet industry.
It purports to represent "America’s leading Internet companies and their global community of users" and is "dedicated to advancing public policy solutions to strengthen and protect Internet freedom, foster innovation and economic growth and empower users".
Platforms.
Protecting Internet freedom.
The Internet Association believes that "the unique nature of the Internet—free from government control and governed by multiple stakeholders—has unleashed unprecedented entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation far beyond imagination. Every day, the Internet provides access to information and personalized content to hundreds of millions of people around the globe—free of charge and free of political interference. Freedom is essential to the preservation of that platform and the resulting economic growth, job creation and political liberty.
The Internet Association supports policies that protect and promote Internet freedom—information should flow freely across national borders, uninhibited by tariffs, regulations and government censorship that are fundamentally inconsistent with the transnational, free, and decentralized nature of the Internet. To preserve the Internet’s role as a conduit for free expression, Internet intermediaries must not be held liable for the speech and activity of Internet users."
Fostering innovation and economic growth.
The Internet Association states that "the Internet allows inventors, entrepreneurs, organizations, and individual users to create and innovate in unprecedented ways. The low-to-nonexistent barriers to entry have made the Internet a remarkable growth engine for small businesses, creating jobs in every sector of the economy. Internet users of all kinds are driving this extraordinary pace of innovation.
The Internet Association supports policies that ensure individual users, businesses, and governments are able to freely choose which Internet technologies and platforms to use and support, without those choices being unduly constrained by regulatory structures that cannot keep pace with and often have the unintended consequence of stifling innovation". 
Empowering users.
The Internet Association says that "Internet-enabled technologies now give all types of users, including individuals, businesses, governments and non-profits, unprecedented control over the content and services they interact with, and the devices and applications they use. The revolution in cloud computing and mobile technologies means that users are no longer tethered to particular locations or devices. Cloud computing has allowed both businesses and individuals to harness massive computing and storage power without needing to buy software or purchase and host the underlying infrastructure themselves.
The Internet Association supports policies that allow all users to take full advantage of the product innovations that technology makes available to them rather than have their choices limited by government mandates. The Internet Association also supports policies that recognize the diversity and value of the business models used by various players in the Internet ecosystem".
