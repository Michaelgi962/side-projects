Midland Library

The Midland Library is a branch of the Multnomah County Library, in Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon. The branch offers the Multnomah County Library catalog of two million books, periodicals and other materials.
History.
Bookmobiles, reading rooms, and small branch libraries provided much of the public library service to Portland neighborhoods in the first half of the 20th century. A library study in 1955 recommended switching to a system of larger branches supported by sub-branches and bookmobiles. 
The large Midland branch opened at S.E. 122nd Avenue and S.E. Morrison Street in 1958 and was the second branch in the county system to serve suburban residents. Oregon authors present at its dedication included Stewart Holbrook, Dorothy Johansen, and others. The building cost $90,000; it initially housed 12,000 volumes, with plans to extend the collection to 20,000. The building offered bicycle racks. By the early 1960s, the library floor area had been expanded to . 
Until the 1990 opening of the new Gresham Library building (13 times the size of the building it replaced), the Midland was considered the second busiest in the county system, after Portland's Central Library. In 1993, Multnomah County voters agreed to spend $5.3 million for a new Midland Library building at the same site along S.E. 122nd Avenue. Thomas Hacker and Associates was the architectural firm for the project and Silco Construction the general contractor. The new library opened on September 16, 1996. It has a floor area of and can hold up to 150,000 books.

Albina Library

The Albina Library is a branch of the Multnomah County Library, located in northeast Portland, Oregon. The library's origins date back to 1906 with the establishment of a small reading room that housed 100 books. The branch has relocated three times since then, moving from the building which now houses The Title Wave Used Bookstore to a retail plaza in northeast Portland.
The branch offers the Multnomah County Library catalog of two million books, periodicals and other materials.
History.
Albina Library was established in 1906 as a small reading room which housed 100 books under the custodianship of Mrs. P.P. Leche. According to Multnomah County Library, the precise location of the reading room is unknown and circulation records for 1906 do not exist. In September 1907 the library relocated to a larger space within the Emporium building on Williams Avenue. The Library Association of Portland's 1907 annual report states, "... on September 16, the branch was opened in charge of Miss Ella G. Dewart. The eagerness with which the people of Albina young and old have taken advantage of this library has been a surprise even to those who believed most thoroughly in it. It has been almost impossible to keep the shelves supplied with books." In 1909 the library moved to Russell Street; by the end of the year the collection contained 3,149 volumes and circulation increased to 36,800 items.
In 2009, the library closed briefly for a remodeling of the staff workroom. Self-checkout stations and security gates were installed in 2010. 
Over the years the library has hosted numerous activities, including arts and crafts workshops, book groups, performances for children, plays and reading sessions with therapy dogs. The library has also served as a Loaves & Fishes meal site as well as a ballot drop-off site during elections.

Belmont Library

The Belmont Library is a branch of the Multnomah County Library, located in Belmont, Portland, Oregon. The original library building opened in 1924 and was expanded in 1937 with the addition of a children's room. The brick building had small round windows and large oak tables. Renovations during 1999–2000 nearly doubled the library's capacity.
The branch offers the Multnomah County Library catalog of two million books, periodicals and other materials. The Belmont Library features a 24-person capacity meeting room for hosting community events at no charge on a first come, first served basis. A decorative quilt made by residents of the Sunnyside neighborhood is also housed within the building.
History.
In 1923, residents of the Belmont and Hawthorne areas of southeast Portland raised funds to construct a library building at East 39th Avenue and Taylor Street (now S.E. César E. Chávez Blvd. and S.E. Taylor Street). The Library Association of Portland paid for the building plans. According to the association president, the Belmont effort was one of the first in Portland during which library users raised funds to erect a branch library building in their own neighborhood. The neighborhood presented the building debt-free to the association in early 1924, and the library opened on March 7, 1924.
Federal funds through the Works Progress Administration paid for expansion of the library in 1937. The addition of a children's room and staff work areas increased the building's floor area to . Even so, circulation at the library continued to grow until the floor area was considered inadequate. In 1996, voters approved a bond measure to renovate the county's libraries and to pay special attention to four of them, including Belmont. The branch closed in June 1999 for remodeling and reopened in March 2000. The resulting expansion added to the library's floor area, bringing the total area to . The renovated library can hold up to 20,000 volumes. Self-checkout stations and security gates were installed in 2011 during a minor renovation.
Over the years the library has hosted numerous activities, including a children's jamboree, knitting groups, lectures and readings. The building has also served as a ballot drop-off site during elections.

Capitol Hill Library

The Capitol Hill Library is a branch of the Multnomah County Library, in the West Portland Park neighborhood of Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon. The branch offers the Multnomah County Library catalog of two million books, periodicals and other materials. Capitol Hill and the Holgate branch are of a similar design.
History.
Until the 1960s, Portland's system of public libraries relied heavily on the downtown Central Library supplemented by small collections at many locations in outlying neighborhoods . As population densities changed, the library board responded by establishing larger collections in fewer locations and creating new branch libraries. From 1967 through 1969, the board worked to establish a new branch near Capitol Hill in the West Portland Park neighborhood. The architectural plan was the same as that of the Holgate Library.
Although the library opened part-time for a month in early 1972, it did not open officially until December 5, 1972, aided by federal revenue sharing funds. Budget crises affected the library through the 1970s and early 1980s, and Capitol Hill sometimes operated on reduced hours and book budgets through 1984. In that year, voters approved a three-year serial levy (tax) to help fund the library system. Subsequent temporary levies supported the system through November 2012, when voters approved a permanent levy. 
In 1996, Multnomah County voters passed a bond measure to renovate some branches and to upgrade technology across the system. Closed for renovation in mid-1998, Capitol Hill reopened on February 16, 1999. The architect on the original building was Allen, McMath and Hawkins, and the renovation architect was Thomas Hacker and Associates. Capitol Hill has a floor area of with a capacity of 20,000 volumes.

Kenton Library

The Kenton Library is a branch of the Multnomah County Library (MCL), in the Kenton neighborhood of Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon. Preceded by reading rooms in North Portland and later by the Lombard Branch Library, the Kenton Library opened in 2010 in a storefront on North Denver Avenue. The branch offers the MCL catalog of two million books, periodicals and other materials.
History.
Public library service to the neighborhood started in 1903, when the Library Association of Portland placed a small collection of books available to patrons via a nearby school. In 1907, two reading rooms—the Peninsular Reading Room and the St. Johns Reading Room—opened in the Kenton vicinity. Each had a collection of between 200 and 300 books. The University Park Reading Room, also near Kenton, opened a year later.
A Lombard Branch Library opened in 1927. It was a joint effort by residents of the Kenton and the Peninsula neighborhoods, who wanted a larger library but could not afford one even with help from the Library Association. The two communities held a fundraising drive, formed a corporation, borrowed money, and paid to construct a library building at Lombard and Boston streets. In 1937, the corporation gave the building to the Library Association, which agreed to maintain the library and pay the mortgage debt. In 1981, Multnomah County voters said "no" to one of the library funding requests on the ballot. The subsequent reductions in library service included closing the Lombard Library.
Advocates for a Lombard Library, a citizens group, formed in 2000 to restore library service to the neighborhood. Their quest for funding and for the support of the Multnomah County Commissioners eventually met with success. In 2006, voters approved a levy that included funds for new libraries in North Portland and eastern Multnomah County. The commissioners subsequently chose a storefront site at 8226 N. Denver Avenue for the Kenton Library, a building constructed in 1951. It opened on March 8, 2010, after a remodel that included an addition to increase space to . Hennebery Eddy Architects Inc. designed the renovations with Cedar Mill Construction Company serving as the general contractor on the project.
Radio tags.
Kenton Library was the first new library in the Multnomah County Library system to have its entire collection tagged with radio-frequency identification devices (RFID)s before it opened. The MCL began installing the RFIDs systemwide in 2009. Tags are equipped with antennas that respond to radio signals. They help prevent theft by triggering an alarm at the door if an item has not been properly checked out, and they reduce the number of steps needed at checkout. Library staff can scan rows of books with a hand wand or catalog a whole stack of books placed on a flat scanner.
Urban renewal.
The Portland Development Commission carried out a $2.85 million urban-renewal project in Kenton in 2010. Improvements included better street pavement, wider sidewalks, trees, and planter boxes in the block that includes the library and a variety of small businesses. However, not all of the block has been modernized. In March 2011, business owners expressed concern about forced entry into a vacant building next to the library.

North Portland Library

The North Portland Library is a branch of the Multnomah County Library, in Portland, Oregon. The branch offers the Multnomah County Library catalog of two million books, periodicals and other materials.
History.
Public library service in the neighborhoods of North Portland began with the opening of a reading room on North Albina Street in 1909. Starting with a collection of about 500 books, it became a sub-branch of the Portland library system in 1911 but without all of the services offered by the Central Library in downtown Portland. Later in 1911, the collection was moved to another building and merged with books from another reading room to create the North Albina Library, a branch of the Central Library.
After the Carnegie Corporation of New York donated funds for four new branch libraries in Portland in 1912, the community undertook construction of the North Portland Library to replace the North Albina Library. Built on land donated by neighborhood residents, the Jacobean-style library opened on February 20, 1913, on the corner of North Killingworth Street and North Commercial Avenue. Interior architectural details include an open-beam ceiling and bas-reliefs. Patrons have included students from Jefferson High School, built next door to the library.
In 1955, North Portland Library was among six branches chosen for expanded collections, longer hours, more services, and daily deliveries from the Central Library. In 1987, a wing of the library was devoted to works about African-Americans. In 1996, Multnomah County voters passed a bond measure to renovate and modernize branch libraries in the system. North Portland Library got seismic retrofitting, a new roof, an elevator, new lighting and furniture and telecommunications equipment, more restrooms, and improvements to plumbing and other infrastructure. 
The seismic retrofit resulted from changes to Portland's building codes aimed at making structures less likely to collapse during an earthquake. The changes apply to older buildings when they are being altered in other ways such as changing occupancy, building an addition, or repairing the roof. The North Portland Library was particularly vulnerable to strong ground movements because of its unreinforced masonry. Degenkolb Engineers undertook the retrofit. It was the first of its kind in Portland, according to a Degenkolb representative quoted in a news article in the "Daily Journal of Commerce". In 2011, Degenkolb won a Grand Award from the Consulting Engineers Council of Oregon for its structural engineering work on the library.
After being closed for about a year for the renovation work, the building reopened on March 21, 2000. Self-checkout stations and security gates were installed in 2011.

Northwest Library

The Northwest Library is a branch of the Multnomah County Library, in Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon. The branch, which opened in 2001, offers the Multnomah County Library catalog of two million books, periodicals and other materials.
History.
The branch opened on October 30, 2001, and was the first new branch in the Multnomah County system since 1972. At , the library is designed to accommodate 20,000 volumes. Located in Portland's most densely populated community, it was highly anticipated by neighbors. The building previously was home to the Harris Wine Cellar.
The new library was funded by a $113 million levy passed in 1998, which funded reconstruction or renovation of 12 of the system's 15 branches. As of May 2000, Multnomah County officials were considering one location between N.W. 22nd and 23rd avenues and N.W. Lovejoy Street, and another on N.W. 23rd Avenue and Thurman Street. Then-county commissioner Diane Linn worked with county officials to find the location. Including affordable housing in the mixed use design of the building was an important consideration. The Thurman Street location was ultimately selected. Another $77,000 was provided to the branch by the Library Foundation in November 2001, with the majority of that added to a permanent fund for the branch.
Architects for the renovation of the existing building were Holst Architecture for the exterior and Thomas Hacker and Associates for the interior. Northwest General Contractors was the contractor. Structural changes during the renovation included seismic upgrades and improved access for patrons with disabilities. Interior redesign added a meeting room, and the library was made Internet-ready.

The branch offers the Multnomah County Library catalog of two million books, periodicals and other materials. The library also features a 30-person capacity meeting room for hosting community events at no charge on a first come, first served basis.
History.
In 1961 the Library Association of Portland (LAP) examined library use compared to population demographics and recommended the construction of five additional branch buildings. Three buildings would consolidate six "inefficient" branches and one would replace an existing but outdated structure. The Rockwood Library was the only new building in the proposal that would not replace another branch.
The LAP announced the purchase of a building site in April 1962. According to the LAP's 1962–63 annual report, "The Rockwood Branch, located about halfway between the Midland and Gresham branches, will serve a growing area with a population of over 20,000, a high percentage of which are children." The building was designed by Stewart, Richardson, Allen and McMath; Neilson Construction and Investment Company served as the contractor. The Rockwood Library was dedicated on April 10, 1963. The building housed a new collection of 12,000 books with the capacity to hold 20,000 volumes. Helen Gorder became the branch's first librarian.
A reading center was established at the library in the late 1980s, to serve the needs of illiterate adults learning to read. The center was funded by a grant from the Library Services and Construction Act, which also paid for a reading center at the Central Library in downtown Portland. Rockwood was selected due to its proximity to the Mt. Hood Literacy Coalition Group, connected with Mt. Hood Community College and the Salvation Army. 
In 1999 the branch underwent renovation and expansion, opening on September 14 with and the capacity to hold 30,000 volumes. Renovations were designed by Thomas Hacker and Associates; contract work was provided by Andersen Construction Co., Inc. In 2008, the library was reported to have about a dozen volunteers, many fluent in Spanish and Russian, available to assist library patrons. As of 2010, the library had about 10 tables and 15 computers. That year, Rockwood was the 12th library in the Multnomah County system to implement a new RFID-based self-checkout system designed to reduce costs and theft of library materials.
Community role.
Over the years the library has hosted numerous activities, including computer classes, ESL classes, finance education classes, knitting groups, language exchange programs, and Spanish-speaking book clubs. The library has also been called a "safe and dry to hang out" space for teens. A majority of the staff members are bilingual. Rockwood Library features Spanish and Russian literature.
In 2011, "The Oregonian" reported that nearly 800 items are circulated by 600 people visiting the library daily. The newspaper also reported the library had a budget of $804,477.

Sellwood-Moreland Library

The Sellwood–Moreland Library is a branch of the Multnomah County Library, in the Sellwood neighborhood of Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon. First established in 1905 as the Sellwood Reading Room, it operated in several Sellwood locations before re-opening in 2002 in a new mixed-use building at S.E. 13th Avenue and Bidwell Street. The branch offers the Multnomah County Library catalog of two million books, periodicals and other materials.
History.
First established in 1905 as the Sellwood Reading Room, this small library in a storefront opposite Sellwood School was the first public library in Multnomah County aside from the main library in downtown Portland. The reading room's collection, provided by the Portland Library Association, amounted to 150 books. Judged too small for the community's needs, the library was expanded in the same location to 1,000 volumes in 1907, when it was renamed the Sellwood Branch Library. 
Two years later, the library was re-located to 570 S.E. Tacoma Avenue, closer to the business district and a (now defunct) streetcar line. In 1915, it was moved again, this time to a rental property at 582 S.E. Nehalem Street, and in 1931 it was moved to 1406 S.E. Nehalem Street. After the owners of the Nehalem Street building sold it, the community decided to finance its own building at S.E. Milwaukie Avenue and Lexington Street. Designed by architect Loyal Lang, the library opened on September 30, 1965. 
Bonds approved by county voters in 1996 provided money to renovate branch libraries, including Sellwood-Moreland. By then, the existing library had plumbing, mechanical, and other problems, and it lacked the wiring needed to support modern technology. It was overcrowded; designed to hold 6,500 items, it held 31,200. In 2000, the Multnomah County Commissioners agreed to lease space in a mixed-use building to be constructed at S.E. 13th Avenue and Bidwell Street. The old library closed in January 2002, and the new library opened on February 12, 2002. Its floor space amounts to in a building that includes commercial space and 16 residential condominiums. The old building was sold in 2003 for $210,000.

The branch offers the Multnomah County Library catalog of two million books, periodicals and other materials.
History.
Early public library services in the St. Johns neighborhood began in 1903, when the Library Association of Portland established a small "deposit station" of books at a public school on the peninsula between the Columbia and Willamette rivers. In 1907, the St. Johns Reading Room and the Peninsular Reading Room, each with a collection of 200 to 300 books and a few reference works, offered public library services. These early ventures led to the opening of a St. Johns branch of Portland's central library on November 22, 1913.
The Georgian library, with a floor area of , adapted to changing demographics and economic conditions over the rest of the 20th century but remained at the same address. The building housed a baby clinic as well as a library from 1918 through the 1950s. During World War II, the Rations Board had an office in the building, and library patrons included a wide variety of newcomers who worked during the war in the nearby shipyards. 
After Multnomah County voters passed a bond measure in 1996 to renovate branch libraries, St. Johns Library was among four branches qualifying for significant upgrades. It closed for renovation of its plumbing, wiring, and other systems in March 2000 and reopened on February 13, 2001. In the process, its floor area was expanded to , capable of holding 25,000 books.

Holy Rosary Church (Baltimore, Maryland)

Holy Rosary Church is a Roman Catholic church located in Baltimore, Maryland. It was established to serve Baltimore's Polish community.
History.
The Holy Rosary Church was established to serve the needs of the burgeoning Polish community in Baltimore. The parish was established in 1887, though the present church was built from 1927-1928. It is constructed of greystone in the Polish Basilica style of architecture with limestone trim. It is 200 feet long, 100 feet wide, with twin towers 125 feet tall. The north tower contains four bells, the largest of which weighs 3000 pounds.The interior is unobstructed by columns, and seats 2000. The altars are of Carrara marble. The main altar is 20 feet wide and 30 feet high. The communion rail is 80 feet long. The 3 manual Moller organ has 3000 pipes.The original parish had around 500 families, making up 2,000 people. The church celebrated its first mass on December 8, 1887. In 1889, acreage was purchased outside of Dundalk, Maryland for the construction of a parish cemetery. A parish elementary school was built not long after and the Felician Sisters were invited to teach at the school.
The parish peaked in the 1930s. At that time the church had around 2,500 families (12,000 people in all), the largest in the Archdiocese of Baltimore and the parish elementary school had an enrollment of around 1,800 children. However, the congregation began to decline after World War II. Many Polish-Americans left Baltimore for the suburbs during the 1960s and 1970s, leaving an aging population in the city. Due to declining enrollment, the church closed the parish elementary school in 1997.
The church continues to promote itself as a center for the Baltimore Polonia and actively uses the Polish language. Polish language services are held on Sunday Mass and weekdays. The church's Cardinal Hlond Polish School holds classes on the Polish language and on Polish Catholic history. A number of Polish Catholic traditions are still practiced at the church, such as "Boże Ciało" (Corpus Christi) procession, the Easter Resurrection procession, and the Holy Saturday Easter food basket blessing.
The parish church is the Archdiocesan Shrine for Divine Mercy. The dedication of the Divine Mercy Shrine occurred on the first feast day of Mary Faustina Kowalska. Notably, Pope John Paul II (who was then Karol Cardinal Wojtyla) visited and prayed at the shrine during a visit in 1976.
Fr. Ronald Pytel was a parish priest at the church. His healed heart condition was one of the miracles cited during the canonization of St. Maria Faustina Kowalski in 2000.

Typhoon Sinlaku (2002)

Typhoon Sinlaku (international designation: 0216, JTWC designation: 22W) was a damaging typhoon that affected Okinawa, Taiwan, and eastern China in September 2002. The 16th named storm of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season, Sinlaku formed on August 27 northeast of the Northern Marianas Islands. After initially moving to the north, it began a generally westward motion that it maintained for the rest of its duration. Sinlaku strengthened into a typhoon and attained its peak winds on August 31. Over the next few days, it fluctuated slightly in intensity while moving over or near the Ryukyu Islands. On September 4, the typhoon's eye crossed over Okinawa. It dropped heavy rainfall and produced strong winds that left over 100,000 people without power. Damage on the island was estimated at $14.3 million.
After affecting Okinawa, Sinlaku threatened northern Taiwan, which was previously affected by two deadly typhoons in the previous year. Officials enacted many preparations, although damage ended up being minimal on the island. Two people were killed on Taiwan, however. Sinlaku weakened slightly before making its final landfall in eastern China near Wenzhou on September 7. There, the storm produced a record wind gust of 204 km/h (127 mph), and just south of the city, high waves destroyed several piers and a large boat. High rainfall and winds from Sinlaku destroyed 58,000 houses, and large areas of crops were destroyed. Damage in China was estimated at $709 million, and there were 28 deaths there.
Meteorological history.
The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring a tropical disturbance on August 26, noting that an area of convection had an associated circulation. With favorable conditions, the agency assessed a fair potential for development. On August 27, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as tropical depression south of the Japanese island of Minamitorishima, although the circulation was exposed from the convection. The next day, the JTWC initiated warnings on Tropical Depression 22W about 945 km (565 mi) northeast of Saipan, after the thunderstorms began wrapping into the center.
Initially, the depression moved generally northward through a weakness in the subtropical ridge, strengthening into Tropical Storm Sinlaku on August 29. The building ridge, located east of Japan, gradually turned the storm westward. As early as August 29, the JTWC reported that an eye feature was beginning to develop. After further intensification, Sinlaku strengthened, and the JMA upgraded it to a typhoon on August 31; the JTWC estimated Sinlaku attained typhoon status a day earlier.
Shortly after Sinlaku become a typhoon, the JMA estimated it attained peak 10 minute maximum sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph). Also on August 31, the JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 205 km/h (125 mph). On September 1, Sinlaku began undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, although cooler water temperatures caused by previous Typhoon Rusa prevented restrengthening. The typhoon turned more to the west-northwest on September 2, and without much change in intensity, it passed just south of Iwo Jima that day and very near the Japanese island of Minamidaitojima around 2130 UTC on September 3. The next day, Sinlaku also passed just south of Okinawa, although its large 110 km (70 mi) eye crossed over the southern portion of the island; the JTWC estimated the storm had winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) while passing near Okinawa. A trough passing north of Sinlaku slowed the typhoon's westward movement. Dry air in the region, and later increased wind shear caused a steady weakening trend. On September 6, Sinlaku passed a short distance north of Taiwan, and subsequently a west-northwest motion resumed. The JMA downgraded the typhoon to a severe tropical storm on September 7 in the East China Sea, although the JTWC maintained it as a typhoon. Around 1030 UTC that day, Sinlaku made landfall in east-central China near Wenzhou, a city near the border of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces. The storm weakened while progressing inland, although its circulation remained well-defined until dissipating on September 9.
Preparations and impact.
Typhoon Sinlaku first affected Iwo Jima, producing sustained winds of 131 km/h (82 mph), with gusts to 183 km/h (114 mph). Residents on the small island of Minamidaitojima evacuated their homes to safer areas during the storm. Rainfall caused flooding on the island. Offshore Okinawa, a Philippine cargo ship went missing, prompting a rescue mission by the Japanese Coast Guard. The crew was rescued a day later, and no one was injured.
Before affecting the island, officials on Okinawa canceled 150 airplane flights and halted bus service. Schools ended early, and only essential personnel were reporting at Kadena Air Base. While striking Okinawa, Sinlaku dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at at two locations. Rainfall spread northward through the Amami Islands, reaching at Yoronjima. The highest hourly precipitation total was , recorded at Naha, Okinawa. Sinlaku produced winds as strong as , with gusts to 191 km/h (118 mph) on Okinawa. Gale-force winds affected the island for about 21 hours. During its passage, the typhoon destroyed 11 houses and damaged 231 others, and 45 houses were flooded. High winds knocked down power lines, which left 105,500 homes without electricity on Okinawa. Sinlaku injured 31 people, four of them severely, but there were no deaths in Japan. Insured damage in Japan totaled $14.3 million (¥1.7 billion 2002 JPY). Sinlaku left about $3.6 million in damage to Kadena Air Base on Okinawa.
In Taiwan, the country's Central Weather Bureau issued storm warnings for coastal waters and for areas along the coast. Premier Yu Shyi-kun ordered various government agencies fully prepare for the typhoon, including the activation of a disaster contingency system. The typhoon caused the Taiwan Stock Exchange to close at its lowest level of the year, before the exchange was closed during the storm's passage. Officials also closed schools and government buildings in Taipei, and flights between northern and southern Taiwan were canceled. The typhoon caused a boat race to be delayed by one day. Passing north of Taiwan, Sinlaku dropped about of rainfall in the capital city of Taipei. A station in Ilan County reported a peak rainfall of . The high rainfall filled two reservoirs to capacity, both of which had low levels in the previous month. The storm left 200 houses without water, and in Taoyuan County, 700 houses lost power. Storm damage forced about 1,500 people to evacuate their houses. High waves lashed the island's northern coast, forcing hundreds of boats to remain at port. This included thousands of Chinese fishermen who stayed in special shelters, which represented a change in policy; in previous storms Taiwan officials did not allow Chinese fishermen to stay for fear of Chinese emigration to the island. Sinlaku killed two people, one who was swept away by high surf along Taiwan's east coast. However, damage was minor on the island, limited to downed tree branches in Taipei. After the storm, Taiwan residents complained that meteorologists over-emphasized the threat of the storm, which was due to heavy damage from typhoons Nari and Toraji.
The threat of Typhoon Sinlaku prompted 640,000 people in eastern China to evacuate, including 48,000 people near Wenzhou who worked on aquaculture farms. About 100,000 troops were put on standby before the storm struck to assist in its aftermath. Eight flights were canceled due to the storm. Upon making landfall, the typhoon dropped heavy rainfall along its path, including a 24 hour total of where it moved ashore. Several cities reported over in a 12 hour period. The rainfall caused the Huangpu River to rise to above-normal levels, which prompted officials to close 1,000 floodgates to prevent flooding in Shanghai. In Wenzhou, Sinlaku produced a peak wind gust of 204 km/h (127 mph), which was the highest gust in the city on record. High waves just south of the city, estimated at 16.2 m (53 ft), wrecked five fishing piers and a large boat. Typhoon-force wind gusts were observed along the coast of Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. About 58,000 houses were damaged or destroyed in the two provinces; this included 3,800 destroyed houses in Wenzhou where the storm struck. The high winds downed trees onto power lines, leaving areas without power. About 97,000 hectares (240,000 acres) of crop fields were wrecked. Many schools and businesses were closed during the storm. Overall damage was estimated at $709 million (¥5.88 billion 2002 CNY), and there were 28 deaths in the country; most of the deaths were caused by collapsing houses. Officials distributed food and thousands of tents and blankets to residents who lost their homes.

Big Brother 14 (UK)

Big Brother 2013, also known as Big Brother 14 and Big Brother: Secrets and Lies, was the fourteenth series of the British reality television series Big Brother. It launched on 13 June 2013 on Channel 5 and 5*, and lasted for 68 days, ending on 19 August 2013. It was part of a new two-year contract with Endemol, which secured the show until 2014. It was the third regular series to air on Channel 5 and the seventh series of "Big Brother" to air on the channel since they acquired the show. The series was won by 23-year old Sam Evans from South Wales. He won the £100,000 prize fund, meaning that he is the first winner since 2010 to win the full prize fund.
Eight housemates entered on launch night, including a set of twins becoming one housemate; with another six, including a mother and daughter, entering the house the following night. Unbeknownst to the housemates, an actor controlled by the viewers, Michael Dylan - otherwise known as "The People's Puppet" - entered the house on launch night, and this was revealed to them upon his departure on Day 9. On Day 33, after a confrontation between housemates Daley Ojuederie and Hazel O'Sullivan, Daley became the first housemate to be ejected from the Big Brother House since "Big Brother" moved to Channel 5. For the first time in civilian "Big Brother" history, no new housemates entered the house following the two launch nights.
The fourteenth series saw the return of viewers voting to evict, rather than voting to save alike the two previous series. This way of voting had not been used since "Ultimate Big Brother". 
This was the first series of "Big Brother" to be presented by "Big Brother's Bit on the Side" co-host Emma Willis and the first presenter change since Brian Dowling took over from Davina McCall in 2011. Willis continued to host "Bit on the Side" along with Rylan Clark and AJ Odudu, who replaced Jamie East and Alice Levine.
Production.
Auditions.
On 11 December 2012, it was revealed that "Big Brother" producers had axed all open auditions for "Big Brother 14", making this the first series since "Big Brother 5" in 2004 to see housemates chosen only from online applications. In order to become a housemate, potential housemates had to record a 90 second video and fill out an online application form.
If bosses liked what they saw, the chosen few would be invited to 'callbacks', which took place in January and February 2013 in London and Manchester. A source said, "With only a few minutes to impress producers, only the best will get into the show this year. There won't be any second chances or opportunities to try again at another open audition. They have just one shot." However, from 13–15 December, "Talent Spotters" from "Big Brother" visited bars in Blackpool to find new housemates; they also visited Huddersfield on 14 December 2012.
Presenters.
On 13 March 2013, it was reported that Brian Dowling had been removed from presenting "Big Brother" and that Emma Willis would be taking over. These rumours were confirmed on 2 April. It was also speculated that Rylan Clark would be taking over the role of hosting "Big Brother's Bit on the Side" after previously winning "Celebrity Big Brother 11" in January 2013.
On 17 April, Alice Levine and Jamie East both announced via Twitter that they had left spin-off show "Big Brother's Bit on the Side" after six series. On 25 April, "The Sun" reported that Clark would be taking over as the new host of "Big Brother's Bit on the Side". Clark initially denied this, but Channel 5 officially confirmed on 14 May that Clark and AJ Odudu would join Willis as presenters of "Big Brother's Bit on the Side"; and that Willis would continue her "Bit on the Side" role in addition to taking over as host of the main show. Plus, "Big Brother's Bit on the Psych" aired on Saturday nights, with Odudu as the sole presenter, and included guests and psychologists examining housemates' behaviour during the week. Clark also hosted a Sunday lunchtime edition of "Bit on the Side", called "Rylan's Supersized Celebrity Sunday".
Format.
The fourteenth series of "Big Brother" introduced several changes to the format. One of the changes implemented in the fourteenth series was the return of "Vote to Evict". This way of voting had not been used since "Ultimate Big Brother". Another change was Big Brother sometimes revealing the number of nominations each nominee received to the housemates, and it also saw the three or more housemates with the most nominations facing the public vote each week, with the nominated housemate who had the fewest votes to evict after lines had been frozen usually being saved during a live segment in the Wednesday highlights show. Voting lines then reopened. During the live eviction show, for the first time, nominated housemates were given thirty seconds to broadcast a 'plea' explaining why they think they should stay in the house.
Eye logo.
An alternate eye logo was officially unveiled on 24 May 2013. The dark eye sported a pupil built entirely of television screens, whilst the rest of the eye consisted of life-sized recycled doors, furniture and white fluorescent lights to coincide with the theme of the series, a stark contrast from the bright colours of the "Big Brother 13" eye. The "official" eye logo, which features it on a white background with colour, was revealed on 4 June. Channel 5 admitted that they deliberately "fooled" fans by concealing the eye as a tie-in to the 'Secrets and Lies' theme of the series.
House.
On 5 May 2013, it was reported that the House had been "completely redesigned". On 23 May 2013, it was confirmed that the house would be 'Eco' in design. The series was expected to show the objective of self-sufficiency and recycling throughout and this was represented throughout the house. Inside the house, as housemates entered, they were greeted by a huge wall containing recycled life-sized doors. Behind one of the doors was the Diary Room; a housemate could call to talk to Big Brother in this room from the bottom of the stairs. Inside the Diary Room was a metallic based chair, layered in slim red padding. Outside of the Diary Room, there was a sweeping staircase leading down to an eco-living room with producers desperate to make the housemates experience 'hell in a hell house'. The living room contained different coloured sofas and chairs and a plasma television. Beside the living room, there was a circular style kitchen for housemates to use. The housemates could store their food items and utensils obtained from the adjacent store room in a purpose-built cow. There was a round table for housemates to sit at and eat together at. Beside the living room, there was a small toilet, and the bedroom. The bedroom was colourful in design this year, and introduced a bike which powered the hair dryers and hair straighteners when active. Both the bedroom and the living area led out into the garden. This series, the garden had a barred prison for any housemates that misbehaved, as well as a treehouse for housemates to get cosy in and it included the returning vegetable patch which was last seen in "Big Brother 4". Housemates had to shower outside; with one housemate having to spin a wheel that powered the only shower. The traditional mangle also made its return to the house. House pictures were officially unveiled in the "Daily Star" on 10 June 2013.
The Safe House.
On 19 June 2013 episode of "Big Brother's Bit on the Side", rumours arose of a secret bedroom visible in this year's house plan. It had an en suite with baths, a shower and a toilet. On 3 July 2013, it was confirmed that a duo of fake evicted housemates would re-enter a Big Brother House next door called the Safe House. These housemates lived under a lap of luxury and gained immunity from nominations for a whole week. They were allowed to spy on the other housemates with a television and headphones. This is similar to "Big Brother 5" and "Ultimate Big Brother"s bedsit, "Big Brother 12"s crypt and "Celebrity Big Brother 11"s luxury basement.
Live feed.
Channel 5 announced on 14 May 2013 that the live feed would be partly reinstated, for two hours per day. "" aired each night from 7–9pm on 5* (except Sundays where only one hour was broadcast from 8–9pm). Live feed was also broadcast on Channel 5 after every live eviction show for 30 minutes, after "Big Brother's Bit on the Side", to show how the housemates coped with the results of the weekly eviction. On 26 June 2013, Channel 5 announced that it would axe the nightly live feed on 5*, however, in affect after 30 June. The live feed later made a return online via channel5.com between midnight (11:30pm on Sundays) and 2am daily from 12 July 2013.
Teasers.
On 17 May 2013, a six-second teaser aired on Channel 5 ahead of the new series asking viewers to guess "#whatsthesecret". On 19 May, a second teaser aired which featured two doors that were pink and blue, as well as asking viewers to guess "#whatsthesecret". These teasers led to speculation that the new series could be based on a similar premise to "Secret Story", a format that has been successful worldwide. On 13 June 2013, prior to the launch, Channel 5 published 15 housemate teasers. This lead to rumours that there would be sixteen housemates, as one teaser mentioned twin housemates. It was even rumored that a "viewers' puppet" controlled by viewers votes would enter the house.
Sponsorship.
The series sponsor was casino website and TV programme (that airs nightly on Channel 5) SuperCasino.
The series also featured Product Placement from Very.co.uk who supplied products for the house, along with Aquafresh, Weetabix, L'Oréal, Zeo and Levi Roots (on Day 59). Housemates ordered their shopping from online grocery business Ocado, using an iPad, as part of another product placement agreement.
Housemates.
On Day 1, eight housemates entered the house. The first two housemates, Jack and Joe, entered as one housemate. A further six housemates entered on Day 2, including a mother and daughter duo competing as two individual housemates.
The People's Puppet.
29-year-old Michael Dylan from Cork entered the house as "The People's Puppet" on Day 1, and was hired by Big Brother as a housemate that was controlled by the viewers. Unlike every other housemate, Michael did not have genuine housemate status and is referred to as a non-housemate or a houseguest. Michael's true identity as "The People's Puppet" was revealed on Day 9, and he then left the house.
Weekly summary.
The main events in the "Big Brother 14" House are summarised in the table below. A typical week began with nominations, followed by the shopping task, and then the eviction of a housemate during the live Friday episode. Evictions, tasks, and other events for a particular week are noted in order of sequence.
Ratings and reception.
Television ratings.
Official ratings were taken from BARB and include Channel 5 +1. 
1 Ratings for these episodes do not include Channel 5 +1.
Controversy and criticism.
More than 150 people complained to television watchdog Ofcom after Big Brother issued Jemima Slade a formal warning on Day 4 over her apparent offensive comments towards Gina Rio. Gina took offence to Jemima's comments about her disliking of dating black men and she deemed her to be racist.
On Day 33, Daley became the first housemate to be ejected from the Big Brother House since the show moved to Channel 5. The ejection was due to Daley's threatening behaviour towards Hazel. Channel 5 later chose to broadcast the footage that caused the ejection which showed Daley slap Hazel's behind, clasp her by her throat and pin her down against her bed. This resulted in Ofcom receiving a total of 60 complaints and it was later confirmed that they had launched an investigation. Daley was later banned from appearing on the show's final.
Over 200 complaints were received by Ofcom later on in the series pertaining to an argument which Gina had with Hazel. During the heated argument, Gina described Hazel as a 'skank' and a 'whore', continuously referring back to Hazel's relationship with Daley. Some viewers deemed Gina's actions as a form of bullying.

Arunendu Das

Arunendu Das (born 1938) (known universally as Arunda) is arguably a pioneer of late 20th century alternative Bengali song-writing. While Mohiner Ghoraguli is considered to be the first Bengali Band, Arunendu was the first person to compose Bengali lyrics for songs written specifically to be accompanied by guitar, a genus of Bengali music which has become increasingly popular over time.
Early life.
Arunendu was a member of the scout group of Bhowanipur Mitra Institution (Kolkata), and travelled with them on a camping trip to Puri (Orissa) in the summer of 1955. It was at that time, during a friendly singing competition between various other scout groups camping there, that he conceived the idea of composing his own lyrics. His song ‘Chanchal ek Dal Scout Bhai’ (‘A Restless Group of Boy Scouts’), applying his own Bengali lyrics to the tune of the popular contemporary song ‘Ujjawl ek-jhank Paiera’ (‘A Cluster of Bright Pigeons’).
Arunendu was introduced to the formal rudiments of music and the techniques of playing the steel guitar by his school friend Prabir Kumar Das. He sought to exploit this newfound knowledge fully during his time at Bengal Engineering College, Shibpur (1956-1961), where he studied Architecture. He continued his songwriting and composed parodies of various contemporary songs to amuse and entertain his fellow students. His songs and parodies were immensely popular and many of his friends continued to sing his songs to their friends in various places, even after leaving college.
During his time at BE College Arunendu was actually more established and appreciated as a Hawaiian guitar player and by his own admission never dared to sing publicly. Though inspired by Bengali singers like Hemanta Mukhopadhyay, Pratima, Sandhya Mukhopadhyay, Manna De, Shyamal, Satinath and Manabendra, Dhananjay who were in their heyday, he never intended to make a career out of music, preferring to write his songs purely for his own enjoyment.
Most of his songs were personal in nature, and were composed primarily to exercise his newly acquired knowledge about the chords on a steel guitar and to sing to his close circle of friends. At this time Arunendu also started to dabble in classical Spanish guitar, not then an easily available option in Kolkata with its usage restricted to the pubs of the Park Street area and certain members of the Anglo-Indian community.
In England.
Arunendu came to England in the late sixties, and was immediately struck by the lyrics and renderings of contemporary American and English popular songs. Joining the folk club of the market town of Bicester in Oxfordshire where he lived and was practising as an architect, he picked up certain guitar techniques from the resident and guest artists who performed there. He felt that these techniques could be applied to Bengali songwriting and consequently started writing lyrics in Bengali to conform to those melodic and rhythmic ideas. His cousin Prasanta De (Habul), a student of Architecture at BE College at that time and an accomplished folk guitarist in his own right, popularised those songs within the college campus and beyond during the 1970s.
Mohiner Ghoraguli.
Arunendu's songs were never intended for a wider audience and this remained the case until one day Gautam Chattopadhyay paid a visit to his residence in Moore Avenue (Kolkata) in early 1987. One of Gautam’s younger brothers Pradip Chatterjee (Bula), a talented musician, abstract lyricist and expressionist, had studied at BE College during the 1970s and had introduced a number of Arunendu's songs to Gautam. Gautam loved them so much that he included Arunendu's songs in all four of his collections of contemporary Bengali songs which he released in the name of his long disbanded group Mohiner Ghoraguli. During the release of their first come-back album "Aabaar Bochhor Kuri Pore", the accompanying brochure of the same name mentioned about Arunendu as a predecessor of Mohiner Ghoraguli. His songs are also included in "Jhora Somoyer Gaan", "Maya" and "Khyapar Gaan"
Arunendu always preferred referring to his songs as "Chhoy Taarer Gaan" (Songs for Six Strings), as the main inspiration behind writing them was to marry light Bengali songs with the strumming and picking of guitar strings to be in line with the popular songs of the 1960s and 1970s that were prevalent in the international market. In 2004, a CD of some of his songs ‘Arundaar Gaan’ was released by Presto Studio of Kolkata.
A short documentary "Le Pocha" by Qaushiq Mukherjee which talks about Bengali alternative music refers Arunendu as a pioneer to alternative music in Bengali.

Sethi bought this closed hall in 2010. Later he commented– "We took ownership of Jyoti in 2010. We’re still deciding on what to do with the premises. Single-screen halls are fast closing down and this 10,000sq ft space is not large enough to convert into a mall or a multiplex. Parking is also a problem".

<doc id="36799392" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36799392" title="Ward republic">
Ward republic

Ward republic is a concept promoted by Thomas Jefferson to place most of the functions of government in the ward, a small subdivision of a county or municipality. Jefferson thought of this concept as his favorite: "The article nearest my heart," wrote Jefferson to Samuel Kercheval in 1816, "is the division of counties into wards." § His proposal was that such wards consist of no more people than can all know one another and personally perform the functions of government for one another. Although his proposal was not generally adopted, we do see partial implementations of the idea in small townships, school districts, voting precincts, and neighborhood associations.
History.
The concept was inspired by the traditional practice in England and other feudal European countries to organize people below the county level into what were called "hundreds", that is, a geographic group of a few hundred individuals and their families. That concept goes back to a similar practice among the ancient Hebrews of organizing themselves for military purposes, and form a militia unit for each such group. Although intended for feudal administration and defense, hundreds also tended to cooperate in performing other functions of government.
Jefferson presented the idea in a letter to Sam Kercheval in July, 1816. "The true foundation of republican government," Jefferson wrote, "is the equal right of every citizen in his person and property, and in their management." Kercheval, of Winchester, Virginia, had been trying to organize a convention to write a new state constitution, and sought the support of Jefferson, who had been trying since 1776 to get Virginia to adopt a new constitution. 
In that letter Jefferson outlined the need for "ward republics," small units of local government, within Virginia's existing counties, which he thought were too large for direct participation of all the voters. He proposed to divide the counties into "wards of such size as that every citizen can attend, when called on, and act in person … will relieve the county administration of nearly all its business, will have it better done, and by making every citizen an acting member of the government, and in the offices nearest and most interesting to him, will attach him by his strongest feelings to the independence of his country, and its republican constitution."
Jefferson proposed that such ward republics, among their other functions, should select jurors, so that these units of local government would act as a restraint on the judicial as well as the legislative and executive branches of government.
One of the functions to be performed by such wards was public education. Jefferson's 1779 Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge was never passed in the form he proposed. Virginia did not set up a system of mandatory common schools until well into the nineteenth century. However, the concepts it contained persisted and he continued to campaign for public education as the safeguard of republican citizenship.
Jefferson's Bill proposed that each county would be divided into "hundreds … so as that they may contain a convenient number of children to make up a school, and be of such convenient size that all the children within each hundred may daily attend the school to be established therein." Jefferson's deliberate use of the term "hundreds" echoes the Anglo-Saxon term for such a political sub-division. He and many of his contemporaries believed that English and American liberties were rooted in Anglo-Saxon political life. In these "hundreds" we see the origins of Jefferson's later conception of "ward republics," political units so small that "every citizen, can attend, when called on, and act in person." The school system was envisioned as tiered, from primary to secondary to college, so that the ward republics were to be the smallest, most intimate parts of political life and the basis for state republics and the national republic.
Modern practices.
The term "ward" or "precinct" continues to be used for subdivisions of counties or municipalities, but usually only as voting districts to send representatives to county government, or for the administration of county or municipal functions. Most of those subdivisions contain too many people to fit Jefferson's vision. The closest would be voting precincts, which in most states tend to consist of about 3,000 people. There are also small townships and neighborhood associations that realize that concept for at least some people.
Jefferson envisioned a society of small landholders, continuing the system set up by John Locke for the colonies that became North and South Carolina. However, the adoption of the fee simple model of land titles encouraged large landholdings that would make it more difficult to establish ward republics everywhere.
The ward republic model has continued to be advocated by reformers, especially some Libertarians, who argue that the trend toward government centralization presents a threat to rights and liberty, discourages civic virtue, and encourages dependency.

Jean Tubéry

Jean Tubéry (born in Toulouse) is a French player of the cornett (Italian "cornetto") and conductor. He is noted for being, along with his own teacher Bruce Dickey and his colleague Jean-Pierre Canihac, one of the main cornett players to resurrect the baroque instrument, cornet à bouquin, as part of the historically informed performance movement and early music revival. 
Tubéry originally studied recorder at his home town Toulouse and then at the Amsterdam Conservatory, but decided to switch to cornet and undertook studies with Bruce Dickey at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis. During the 1980s and 1990s he performed with almost all of the well known early music ensembles of the period including Les Arts Florissants under William Christie, La Petite Bande under Sigiswald Kuijken, the Clemencic Consort of René Clemencic, Hesperion XXI under Jordi Savall, as well as the Ensemble Clément Janequin of Dominique Visse, Collegium Vocale de Gand for Philippe Herreweghe, Concerto Vocale of René Jacobs, the Huelgas Ensemble of Paul Van Nevel, Cantus Cölln and Konrad Junghänel, The Ensemble Elyma of Gabriel Garrido and so on.
For the Ricercar record label and with the label's own Ricercar Ensemble Tubéry commenced a series of recordings of Venetian wind music, in part entitled "L'héritage de Monteverdi". This continued when he founded his own Ensemble La Fenice. La Fenice won the first prize at the Concours International de Musique Ancienne of Bruges in 1990. Having studied as a cornettist Tubéry furthered studied choral conducting with Hans Martin Linde and Pierre Cao. He is from 2001 the chief early-music conductor of the Chœur de chambre de Namur, and has also served as guest conductor with the Ensemble Jacques Moderne of Tours, Pierre Cao's Ensemble Arsys and the Scottish Dunedin Consort. 
Tubéry teaches cornett at the Conservatoire Supérieur C.N.R. of Paris and his students include several rising performers in the younger generation of cornettists. In 2001 Tubéry was named a Chevalier de l'ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the Minister of Culture Catherine Tasca.

Candice Cohen-Ahnine

Candice Cohen-Ahnine (c. 1977 – 16 August 2012) was a French Jewish mother involved in a legal battle with Saudi Prince Sattam bin Khalid bin Nasser Al Saud over custody for her child Aya, which she said was kidnapped from her. In January 2012, a French court ruled that the prince must hand over the child to Cohen-Ahnine, and the prince faced an international arrest warrant. On 16 August 2012, Cohen-Ahnine fell to her death from a Paris window under mysterious circumstances, days after she told her family that she did not feel safe.
Custody battle.
In 1998, Cohen-Ahnine met Prince Sattam bin Khalid bin Nasser Al Saud, a grandson of Prince Nasser in London at a nightclub while vacationing in London when she was 18 years old. In November 2001, their daughter, Aya, was born. 
The relationship between Cohen-Ahnine and the Prince continued, despite their differences in religion and nationality until he announced in 2006 that he was obligated to marry a cousin, but that Cohen-Ahnine could remain as a second wife. Cohen-Ahnine, however, refused to become a second wife, and the two parted ways.
In September 2008, Prince Sattam allegedly kidnapped Aya when she and her mother visited Saudi Arabia. Cohen-Ahnine said that she had been accused by the Saudi authorities of being a Muslim who converted to Judaism, a capital crime in Saudi Arabia, and was held in the prince's palace. However, she reportedly escaped when a maid left her door open and fled to the French embassy, and subsequently returned to France. Since then, Aya has been living in a palace in Riyadh, while France's Foreign Ministry (as well as former French President Nicolas Sarkozy) attempted to bring the child back to France. Aya spoke occasionally with her mother by telephone.
Prince Sattam denied that he had kidnapped either Aya or her mother, saying that Cohen-Ahnine was allowed to "come and go as she pleased" and that she had converted to Islam and married Prince al-Saud under Islamic law. The prince said the terms of the divorce, which were put through courts in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, required that the parents share custody of the child. The prince also said that a protocol was created which offered Cohen-Ahnine a house (all expenses paid) and access to Aya, and the possibility of taking Aya on vacation for 1.5 months a year. 
Cohen-Ahnine was involved in diplomatic attempts to receive custody of Aya, and wrote a book about her struggle, entitled "Give My Daughter Back!". She stated that she had seen Facebook pictures of Aya in a niqab and playing with the Prince's firearms, and became concerned over her daughter.
Court verdict.
In January 2012, a Paris criminal court ordered Prince al-Saud to hand over custody of Aya to her mother and also to provide child support of €10,000 (£8,300) each month. Cohen-Ahnine said that the ruling was a "great victory for me and vindicates everything I have said... but I'm still very worried for my child’s future." Cohen-Ahnine's lawyer said, "It's a first step in a long journey. Aya must be returned to her mother so that she can live in France, where she has always lived." 
Prince Sattam said that he would challenge the decision and send lawyers to France, and said that France does not have the right to take her back. The prince said, "She is a Saudi citizen and a princess. They cannot oblige a princess to leave this country." The prince also said, "If need be, I'll go like bin Laden and hide in the mountains with Aya." As a result of the court ruling, Prince Sattam faced an international arrest warrant for ignoring the verdict.
Death.
Following the court ruling, Cohen-Ahnine prepared to leave for Riyadh in September 2012 to visit Aya.
On 16 August, Cohen-Ahnine died after falling to her death from a window in Paris. It is unclear whether the death was an accident or was a murder, but suicide has been ruled out.
A few days prior to her death, Cohen-Ahnine told relatives that she felt threatened, and French police were reportedly investigating if she had been trying to escape from her flat, "as if she was escaping something dangerous", and fell out of the window. According to the "London Evening Standard", investigations conducted by the Paris prosecutor suggested that she was attempting to get into a neighboring apartment by climbing through the window.
Cohen-Ahnine's lawyer said the death appeared to be "some sort of accident" and did not know whether it was malicious, but did say that "what I can tell you is that it wasn't a suicide". Jean-Claude Elfassi, a co-author of Cohen-Ahnine's book, said, "I can only show my disgust at the slowness of the investigating judge in charge of her case, who after three years of investigating never delivered an arrest warrant for Prince Sattam al-Saud."
On 21 August, the police announced that Cohen-Ahnine's death was an accident. A witness confirmed seeing her trying to move from one window to another. The police suspect that she was under antidepressant medication; toxicology results are expected.
On 14th June 2013 it was announced that the second husband of Candice Cohen-Ahnine Alain Cucumel was "mis en examen"(in the French criminal procedure the point at which a person formally becomes a suspect at law) for "aggravated assault and battery causing unintentional death".

<doc id="36799420" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36799420" title="Murder of Celine Figard">
Murder of Celine Figard

Celine Marie Therese Figard (23 May 1976 – 19 December 1995) was a 19-year-old accountancy student from Ferrières-lès-Scey in eastern France, who went missing during a visit to the United Kingdom on 19 December 1995, after accepting a lift from a lorry driver at a motorway services in Berkshire. Following an appeal for information on her whereabouts and police enquiries, her body was discovered ten days later on 29 December 1995 at a lay-by in Hawford, Worcestershire. A post-mortem examination determined she had been strangled and bludgeoned to death.
The case received extensive news coverage in the UK around the Christmas and New Year period, amid fears that it could be linked to a series of killings around the English Midlands which police called the work of a "Midlands Ripper". The murder investigation included the UK's first national DNA screening programme in the hunt for a murder suspect, covering over 5,000 people.
Stuart Morgan, a 37-year-old lorry driver from Poole in Dorset was arrested on 19 February 1996 after a colleague recognised his image from a photofit. Morgan was later charged with her murder. Detectives concluded that after raping, strangling and bludgeoning her, he carried her body in his vehicle for ten days over the Christmas period before dumping it. Morgan was given a life sentence after his conviction in October, with a recommendation to serve at least twenty years. An appeal in February 1998 was rejected by the Court of Appeal, and in 2009 the High Court turned down his application for a review of the length of his sentence.
Figard was buried in the French village of Scey-sur-Saône at a service attended by family, friends and politicians in January 1996. In the UK she is remembered in a memorial garden established at a church in the Worcestershire village of Ombersley, close to where her body was discovered.
Background and disappearance.
Celine Figard was the second of four children born to dairy farmers Bernard and Martine Figard of Ferrières-lès-Scey, near Besancon, in a rural community in eastern France. She was a gifted student, with a flair for music, language and mathematics. At the time of her death she was studying accountancy at the Lycée le Grand Chênois in Montbéliard. She developed a fondness for the UK following a 1990 visit and traveled there repeatedly.
She spent the summer of 1995 working at a hotel in Fordingbridge, Hampshire, where her cousin Jean-Marc was head waiter, using the opportunity to improve her English. She returned to the UK in December to spend another two weeks with Jean-Marc. After leaving on 18 December, she travelled with a family friend employed by a local haulage firm to the French coast, as arranged by her parents, and crossed the channel the following day. She arrived in Ashford, Kent. She had intended to travel to Fordingbridge by train, but her escort found another French lorry driver who was willing to take her to Chieveley Services at Newbury in Berkshire. He then helped her to find another trucker for the final leg after she tried to phone her cousin to ask him to pick her up, but misdialed. She was last seen alive at Chieveley Services at Junction 13 of the M4 on the afternoon of Tuesday 19 December, entering a white Mercedes lorry.
Police appealed for information about her disappearance, and issued a photofit of the lorry driver, but he was not identified. By 25 December investigators were working on the theory that he had abducted her. The following day, investigators were working on the assumption she had been murdered. Celine's father travelled to the UK to help detectives in their search for her and to appeal to the public for information as to her whereabouts.
Discovery of body and autopsy.
On the morning of Friday 29 December, the naked body of a young woman was found dumped at a lay-by on the A449 near the Worcestershire village of Hawford by a motorist who had stopped to change a windscreen wiper. Police sought to establish her identity, but were sure it was not Louise Smith, an 18-year-old clerical assistant who had vanished early on Christmas Day after attending a nightclub at Yate, Gloucestershire.
The body was positively identified as Celine Figard the following day. The post mortem determined she had been strangled and bludgeoned with a heavy implement, but did not establish which was fatal. The autopsy revealed "no obvious signs" of sexual assault. However, it determined that sexual intercourse had taken place shortly before her death. Detectives believed it had occurred against her will.
Police said that the body had been there for about twenty-four hours and were working on the theory that she had been held captive before being killed. Detective Chief Superintendent Roger Hoddinott of Hampshire Police said at the time of discovery Figard had been dead for at least four to five days, but did not announce a time of death.
Investigation.
The investigation was led by Detective Chief Superintendent John McCammont of West Mercia Police, and involved more than 100 detectives from three police forces. Officers examined similar unsolved murders amid concerns that they could all be the work of the same individual. Of particular interest were the recent murders of Tracey Turner and Samo Paull, both of whom were found strangled near motorways. McCammont ruled out a link at a press conference on 4 January: "I would stress that at this stage there is no firm evidence whatsoever to link Celine's murder with any other investigations." He appealed for information concerning a bottle of Pascal Chretien champagne, a gift to Figard before coming to England: "This particular type of champagne is not exported to anywhere in the world outside France and is not sold in this country. It is a 1993 vintage and only 60,000 bottles have been produced."
On 12 January, investigators announced that they would perform DNA testing on the drivers of all vehicles similar to the Mercedes. This was the first time the method was used nationally to identify a murder suspect. Detectives traced more than 1,000 vehicles and tested 5,000 drivers. On 19 February, West Mercia Police confirmed that a man had been arrested and was helping them with their inquiries. The following day, authorities announced that the suspect was English and had been arrested in Poole, Dorset in a joint operation between West Mercia and Dorset Police. He was subsequently identified as Stuart Morgan, a 37-year-old, self-employed lorry driver, who on 21 February was remanded following an appearance at Redditch magistrates.
Stuart Morgan.
Stuart William Morgan (born 1958) was an English lorry driver and former heating engineer from Poole. The son of John and Julianne Morgan, one of five siblings, he was raised in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, where his father was employed as a council foreman and his mother – a refugee from the former East Germany – worked as a school cleaner. Morgan left school with three CSEs, and in 1974 served a custodial sentence in borstal following a conviction for burglary. After attending Croydon Polytechnic to train as a plumber and heating engineer, he established a plumbing business in the Tunbridge Wells area. He moved to Dorset following the failure of that business in 1983 and worked as a heating engineer for Bournemouth Borough Council. He became a lorry driver in 1991.
Morgan met his first wife in Kent in the early 1980s. They married in 1982, but he left her when she became pregnant with twins. He met the woman who would become his second wife after moving to Dorset. She also became pregnant, giving birth to a son. They did not marry until 1994, after living together for several years. Morgan had a reputation as a womaniser, seducing customers while working as an engineer. He continued this activity after becoming a lorry driver. Following Morgan's conviction, brother Ray Morgan said, "He has had so many affairs over the years I have lost count." He also had a violent temper. One friend, Dave Moemken, described him as being "on a short fuse".
He was driving from Leeds to Southampton Docks when he picked up Celine Figard on 19 December 1995. Detectives concluded that after raping and killing her, Morgan left her body in the bottom bunk of his cab for up to ten days while he continued to drive the lorry, driving and sleeping in it for at least some of that time. Apparently Morgan left the body in the vehicle after parking it opposite his house to spend Christmas with his family. Police believe he dumped the body on 29 December.
He was arrested after another trucker recognised him from a photofit. Morgan initially denied meeting her. After he was picked out at an identity parade, he claimed he and Figard had engaged in consensual sex.
Trial.
The trial began at Worcester Crown Court on 2 October 1996, before Mr Justice Latham and a jury. Morgan's trial counsel was Nigel Jones QC, and the case was prosecuted by David Farrer QC. Morgan denied the charge.
The prosecution account was that Morgan raped and killed Celine Figard on the afternoon or evening of 19 December 1995, then kept her body in his cab for ten days. Farrer told the court that she had been strangled and battered around the head with a heavy object, and injuries to her face were "consistent with kicking and stamping". There was also evidence to suggest her hands had been taped together, and that sexual intercourse had taken place, with the prosecution of the opinion she had been "intimidated" into having sex.
Evidence was presented by the prosecution to suggest that Morgan continued to use the vehicle while Figard lay dead in the cab, and that the lorry was parked outside his house over the Christmas period. Farrer said Morgan bought a spade, axe and hacksaw with the intention of dismembering the body, but changed his mind, instead making an overnight delivery run to dispose of her remains. After removing a fuse from his lorry's tachograph to conceal the journey, he drove to Worcestershire. Discrepancies were subsequently found in his travel records for 29 December 1995 because he forgot to replace the fuse following the trip. DNA tests on spots of blood found in the cab matched Figard, while a blood-soaked mattress was found in Morgan's garage. Several items belonging to Figard, including photographs and a toilet bag, were recovered from his house. Some of her clothing was found close to a warehouse he had visited the night the body was dumped. Morgan gave two bottles of Pascal Chretien that Figard had brought to England as Christmas presents to two garage attendants who worked at a Shell station opposite his house.
Morgan admitted giving Figard a lift on the afternoon of 19 December 1995. He claimed that the pair had consensual sex after chatting and flirting, developing a rapport and halting at a lay-by where he made her a cup of tea and asked her for what he described as a Christmas kiss. He said afterwards he drove her to Southampton, where they exchanged contact details before he left her, and that she was "smiling and happy". He did not come forward after police appealed for details of the driver who had given her a lift because he did not want his wife to learn of his infidelity. He claimed her photographs and other belongings were in his possession because she had left them in his truck, and the mattress had become stained with blood because a man had lain on it after gashing his leg while the vehicle was on loan to another driver in 1994.
On 16 October a jury took three and a half hours to convict Morgan of Celine Figard's Murder, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommendation that the Home Secretary should decide his parole eligibility. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Latham said, "What you did to Celine has caused revulsion in the minds of all right-thinking people. You are a dangerous man and I will so report to the Home Secretary." Latham subsequently set a minimum term of twenty years, which was later endorsed by the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Bingham, and on 4 November 1998 the Home Secretary informed Morgan of the length of the sentence he must serve.
Appeals.
Morgan appealed his conviction on the grounds that it was unfair due to the level of publicity the case had received. His application was rejected by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales on 5 February 1998 after the three sitting judges ruled there were insufficient grounds to justify an appeal.
In January 2009 Morgan appealed again under paragraph 3 of Schedule 22 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to the High Court of England and Wales requesting a review of the minimum term recommendation. This too was rejected, in July of that year, with the presiding judge, Mr Justice Openshaw recommending, "The sentence is – and remains – a sentence of imprisonment for life. The defendant may not even be considered for release until he has served at least 20 years (less the time served before sentence). That is not to say that he will then be released; indeed he will be detained unless and until the Parole Board is satisfied that he no longer presents a risk to the public. Even if the Parole Board decides then or at some time in the future to authorise his release, he will be upon licence which will extend for the rest of his life."
Aftermath and memorials.
Celine Figard's body was flown home to France on 17 January 1996, where her funeral was held on 20 January. She was buried in Scey-sur-Saône. "The Mail on Sunday" reported that the ceremony was attended by 3,000 mourners, including family, friends and French politicians.
A memorial garden dedicated to Celine Figard was planted at St Andrew's Church in the village of Ombersley, Worcestershire, close to where her body was found, and opened at a ceremony in June 1997. Local residents raised more than £1,000 to help with its construction. The garden also remembers other victims of violent crime, including Joanna Parrish and Caroline Dickinson, two English students who were murdered while in France. On 29 December 2000, the fifth anniversary of the date Figard's body was recovered, the local newspaper, the "Worcester News" reported that an annual service of remembrance was held for her at the church during the autumn, attended by her parents. Flowers were also regularly placed at the lay-by at Hawford where she was found, and the location named "Le Jardin de Celine" (Celine's Garden) in her memory.

Graeme Burton

Graeme Burton is a New Zealander who murdered two people in two separate incidents fourteen years apart. The second murder occurred six months after he was released on parole in 2006. This led to increased public concern about the release of high risk offenders on parole and to internal reviews by the Probation Service and the New Zealand Parole Board of their decision-making and management processes.
Early years.
Burton was adopted as a baby by an older couple. Burton was described as an artistic and polite child, who went off the rails after his adoptive father died when Burton was in his teens. This left his foster mother to raise him on her own. It seems she struggled to cope and was very critical of Burton as he was growing up. If he misbehaved, she would remind him he was adopted and threaten to give him back. As a result of put downs and constant criticism, Burton grew up feeling insecure and angry, with little sense of attachment to his adopted mother. He began using drugs at the age of 15.
The TVNZ documentary "Beyond the Darklands" documented Burton’s increasing experimentation with drugs as a teenager and, in particular, highlighted his use of LSD, cannabis, alcohol and prescription pills. From the age of 17, he was using drugs on an almost daily basis. His girlfriend who was interviewed for the documentary said he used to break into chemist shops to get benzodiazepines and committed burglaries to get money for drugs. By the time he was 21, he had 91 convictions for property, fraud and other drug-related crimes.
Murder of Paul Anderson.
Burton’s frustrations came to a head in 1992 after he was refused entry to a Wellington nightclub. He took his resentment and rage out on Paul Anderson, a lighting technician at the club, stabbing him to death in an alcohol and drug fuelled frenzy. He was said to be "out of it" on six different drugs at the time. A friend said he witnessed Burton taking 8 to 10 Halcion tablets (a benzodiazapine) and a couple of trips (LSD) in the hours before the murder and said he had been drinking "tequila slammers" all evening. This chemical cocktail turned out to be a recipe for disaster.
Burton was sentenced to life and continued using drugs in prison. In May 2002, Burton escaped from Paremoremo Prison sparking a manhunt involving more than 100 police. He was sentenced to three years' prison for the escape and associated crimes.
Parole Board decision to release.
Altogether Burton spent 14 years behind bars. He returned a number of positive drug tests in prison but managed to avoid positive tests in the last three years before he was paroled. He participated in the violence prevention programme after the New Zealand Parole Board regarded him in 2004 as "at high risk of re-offending if released". In September 2005 he was denied parole again because, through no fault of his own, the board's earlier recommendation that the Corrections Department arrange temporary escorted releases to test his conduct away from prison was ignored. However, the board was impressed by information that indicated apparent progress, in particular that "in the last two years his conduct has been described as impeccable". But it wanted one more psychological assessment done on him.
The board's decision to release Burton was made at a hearing in June 2006, and it ordered his release on July 10. The final psychological assessment had been done and concluded: "Mr Burton's documented improvement in conduct and release plan supports a case for a carefully managed release under close supervision." The decision to parole him was made despite the Department's failure to meet the board's request that Burton be eased back into the community by a process of home leaves. The Board also decided it would be unfair to hold against him an unsubstantiated allegation related to an alleged incident in prison, because there was no documentation to confirm whether it had occurred.
Release plan.
Burton was released into the care of his biological mother, whom he barely knew; he had met her about 12 times in the 14 years he had been in prison. She had been living in Australia for some years but agreed to come back to New Zealand for one month to assist Burton's "reintegration". His adoptive mother had died of cancer in 1999.
Burton subsequently revealed he was given a food voucher for $100 when he got out of prison, but it had to be used on the day he got out. He and his mother did not have time to get any food and the voucher expired at the end of the first day, so they had no food. For a while he could not get a Work and Income payment as he had no bank account. Once he got onto the unemployment benefit of $160 a week, Work and Income said he owed them money and he was left with only $69 a week for everything – bus fares, food, clothing, medical expenses and phone.
Burton was required to reside in a suburb in Wellington and he and his mother were given a one-bedroom flat. When his mother arrived from Australia the flat was empty. There was no furniture and no beds. His mother slept in a sleeping bag on the floor for the first three days. It was freezing in the middle of winter and they had no power for a week.
They also had problems with a noisy neighbour who used to bang on the walls all the time. Burton said he told his probation officer about the "mad neighbour" and said he was concerned about his mother's safety. He said that every time he visited his probation officer he asked her to move him to another flat. The Department acknowledged that Burton told them about the noisy neighbour and said his probation officer advised Housing New Zealand that the flat was unsuitable. Burton said he got hold of a gun and told the probation officer: "I'm going to kill my neighbour, he's keeping me awake and I'm losing it. I want to go back to jail. Put me in jail until you can get me another house."
He said the probation officer thought he was just venting his frustrations and did not take him seriously. "Eventually the pressure got to me so I started using a kaleidoscope of drugs which I got for free because I knew everyone who knew me from jail and they wanted to stay on my good side. I started offending – taxing the criminals in the city, establishing myself as the predominant gangster in the Wellington region."
Murder of Karl Kuchenbecker.
His mother went back to Australia and Burton spent the next few months using stand-over tactics and assaulting drug dealers. According to media reports, the police were fully aware that he was buying methamphetamine but failed to act. Police allege that on January 3, 2007 Burton attacked a man in an apartment near his own Tory Street home. A day later a cache of weapons was found at Burton's home, and on January 6 he was involved in a home invasion in Lower Hutt. He killed Karl Kuchenbecker the next day in the hills of Wainuiomata. Burton also fired at several other mountain bikers before levelling his shotgun at the police. The police fired first, hitting Burton in the leg, which was subsequently amputated. Altogether, his drug-fuelled rampage lasted six months.
When Burton was asked to give his account of what happened he said he did not want to go back to prison and hoped he would be killed: "I saw the police and thought, 'It's over'. I was happy. I ran at them smiling, thinking, 'It's over, thank God it's over'. The police shot me and I was hit in the artery in my leg. I thought I'd bleed out. I surrendered as I thought death was certain. Unfortunately, that was not the case, much to my disgust, as I wanted to be killed. I was gutted that I wasn't killed."
Parole Board inquiry.
The Parole Board and the Corrections Department conducted separate inquiries into what went wrong. The Parole Board’s decision making was reviewed by James Ogloff, professor of forensic psychology at Monash University in Australia, and New Zealand’s Chief District Court Judge, Russell Johnson. As part of their review, they reported that Corrections had made some attempt to rehabilitate Burton. In June 2001, he completed a 100 hour substance abuse education programme. However, Katrina Casey, general manager for probation and offender services, said that programme was not a treatment programme for alcohol or drug dependence. In July 2001, Burton also completed the Straight Thinking programme. Both these programmes were subsequently dropped by the Corrections Department when evaluations showed that neither of them worked. They certainly did not work on Burton – he continued using cannabis and returned positive drug tests in April and May 2002.
From 2003 onwards, Burton's drug tests in prison were all negative. Nevertheless, the various psychologists who interviewed him before his release were well aware that his drug addiction had not been addressed. At the crucial Parole Board hearing on 20 June 2006 (the one at which Burton was released), the board had access to six different reports completed between 2002 and 2006. According to Judge Johnson and Professor Ogloff, all six reports recommended further alcohol and drug assessment and treatment, or identified relapse to drug use as a risk factor for Burton.
Corrections Department inquiry.
Corrections examined its handling of the Burton case and also found some serious mistakes. Burton broke his parole conditions for the first time on 5 December 2006, when he phoned his probation officer instead of meeting him, but the probation officer took no action. He subsequently failed to report at all. Corrections did not lodge a complaint with police until 19 December, a week after Burton failed to report and two weeks after his first breach. Coroner Garry Evans found Burton had breached his parole conditions six times in the few months he was on the loose. In his final report on Mr Kuchenbecker's death, Mr Evans said: "Fundamentally, Burton was treated as a normal parolee ... when, in fact, he was a high-risk, high-profile parolee, registered on the department's Offender Warning System, who required close monitoring for early signs of relapse and the taking of immediate and effective action on presentation of such signs ... "
Police also knew of several incidents where Burton robbed and beat up drug dealers towards the end of November 2006, but declined to use the information to get him recalled to prison.
The Corrections Department continued to make mistakes managing parolees even after the Burton debacle. In 2009, only two years later, the Auditor-General Kevin Brady, examined the management of 100 cases of offenders on parole and released a highly critical report of the way Probation handled these cases. Corrections staff were not carrying out some of the new procedures established after the Department’s own investigation into the management of Burton’s parole. This included 28 cases where a probation officer was not assigned to a parolee until after he was released and 15 cases where the service manager did not complete the Warning Register assessment identifying high risk offenders.
Since the Auditor-General’s report, the Probation Service has taken on more staff and tightened up its supervision procedures. In a Radio New Zealand interview on October 22, 2010 the general manager of the Probation Service, Katrina Casey, claimed that 96% of parolees were now being managed correctly.
Later years.
In December 2008, Burton was involved in another violent incident – this time in Auckland's maximum security Paremoremo Prison. He stabbed Headhunters gang member Dwayne Marsh through the heart and in the shoulders, arms and legs with a sharpened steel rod. Marsh who was rushed to Auckland Hospital's emergency department by ambulance and placed in the Intensive Care Unit and Burton was subsequently convicted of attempted murder. Then in 2010 prison officers were placed under investigation after a knife was found in Burton's cell. A source told the "Herald on Sunday" that officers had been failing to make daily cell searches and the homemade pocketknife was discovered hidden inside a fan in his cell.

Roscoea ganeshensis

Roscoea ganeshensis is a perennial herbaceous plant occurring in Ganesh Himal (part of the Himalayas) in central Nepal. Most members of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae), to which it belongs, are tropical, but like other species of "Roscoea", "R. ganeshensis" grows in much colder mountainous regions. It is used as an ornamental garden plant, requiring moisture and shade in the summer.
Description.
"Roscoea ganeshensis" is a perennial herbaceous plant. Like all members of the genus "Roscoea", it grows from a short rhizome, to which the tuberous roots are attached. When growth begins again, "pseudostems" are produced: structures which resemble stems but are actually formed from the tightly wrapped bases (sheaths) of its leaves. "R. ganeshensis" is usually 12–15 cm tall, with five to six leaves. The blade of the leaf (the part free from the pseudostem) is 6–20 cm long by 2.7–5.3 cm wide. The leaf sheaths are wrinkled (rugose) and yellowish-green in colour. At the junction of the blade and sheath there are small transparent structures (ligules), 0.5–2 mm high.
In its native habitats, "R. ganeshensis" is thought to flower between August and September. The stem (peduncle) of the flower spike does not emerge from the leaf sheaths. Several purple flowers are produced, sometimes with a darker mark at the base of the lip or labellum. Yellow-green bracts, 8–13 cm long subtend the flowers.
Each flower has the typical structure for "Roscoea" (see that article for labelled images). There is a tube-shaped outer calyx, about 5–8 cm long. Next the three petals (the corolla) form a tube about 8.5 cm long, terminating in three petal lobes: an upright central lobe and two slightly shorter side lobes. The central lobe is about 3–3.5 cm long by 1–1.4 cm wide, and is paler on the outside with nine purple veins, purple on the inside at the top with purple and white stripes below. The side lobes are 2.7–3.1 cm long by 0.6–0.9 cm wide, also purple and paler at the base. Inside the petals are structures formed from four sterile stamens (staminodes). Two lateral staminodes form what appear to be small petals, about 1.6–2 cm long including a 0.2–0.5 cm narrowed "claw" at the base. Two central staminodes are fused at the base to form a lip or labellum, about 3.6–4.5 cm long by 2.5–3.5 cm wide. The labellum is purple with a "crumpled" surface and is split at the end for up to 1.5 cm into two lobes.
The single functional stamen is white with a linear anther, about 8 mm long, borne on a 4–5 mm long filament. A short cream spur is formed from the connective tissue between the two capsules of the anther, about 1.5–3 mm long. The three-celled ovary is 5–11 mm long.
"R. ganeshensis" can be distinguished from similar species of "Roscoea" by its very short internodes, leaves covered with fine hairs and the appearance of the labellum, which is crumpled with very distinct "shoulders" on its upper corners.
Taxonomy.
"R. ganeshensis" was first described by Jill Cowley and William Baker in 1996. The specific epithet "ganeshensis" is derived from the location where the species was first found, the Ganesh Himal in central Nepal. "R. ganeshensis" resembles a smaller version of "R. purpurea", which grows in the same location.
Evolution and phylogeny.
The Zingiberaceae family is mainly tropical in distribution. The unusual mountainous distribution of "Roscoea" may have evolved relatively recently and be a response to the uplift taking place in the region in the last 50 million years or so due to the collision of the Indian and Asian tectonic plates.
Species of "Roscoea" divide into two clear groups, a Himalayan clade and a "Chinese" clade (which includes some species from outside China). The two clades correspond to a geographical separation, their main distributions being divided by the Brahmaputra River as it flows south at the end of the Himalayan mountain chain. It has been suggested that the genus may have originated in this area and then spread westwards along the Himalayas and eastwards into the mountains of China and its southern neighbours. "R. ganeshensis" falls into the Himalayan clade as would be expected from its distribution. It appears to be most closely related to "R. capitata", although it has been described as resembling a "stunted" "R. purpurea".
Distribution and habitat.
According to Cowley (2007), "Roscoea ganeshensis" is only known from one locality, the Buri Gandaki valley in the Ganesh Himal, central Nepal, where it occurs at about 1,900 metres on a steep rocky bank.
Cultivation.
"R. ganeshensis" is in cultivation as an ornamental plant. General recommendations for the cultivation of roscoeas are a moisture-retaining but well-drained soil, with a mulch of a material such as bark, and shade for at least part of the day. The species was included in a Royal Horticultural Society trial of "Roscoea" species and cultivars in 2009–2011. Although it had been awarded a "Preliminary Commendation" in 1999, it was not given an award in the trial. It was noted that although it remained healthy, it did not increase well, needing more shade and moisture than was provided.

BES-5

BES-5 is an acronym for a Russian thermo-electric generator design in which the heat source is a U 235 fast fission nuclear reactor.
Usually radioisotope thermal generators use Pu 238 as a heat source because it has the lowest shielding requirements. Nonetheless, its decay over time makes it inappropriate for use in deep-space exploration applications, where spaceships need to travel for decades.
The FNR activates just when the critical mass is attained. Then, using a mechanical control system, the reactor can be dormant for centuries and, when necessary, re-activated.
The design of a FNR is similar to an atomic bomb where there is a sub-critical mass (≈90% of the critical mass) where it is inserted a rod of fissile material.
The fission of 2.6 kg of U 235 (5% of the critical mass) is able to produce a constant output of 28 kW for 250 years (2 kW of electricity).

IllRymz

Illrymz, born Olowu Bor dia Adebola on December 3, 1985 in Lagos is a Nigerian television host,urban radio personality, writer, producer, and Hip-Hop & RnB artiste. He is the producer and host of Radio Outloud with Nokia & ILL, a Pan- Nigerian syndicated reality radio show that airs on Beat FM & Cool fm in Lagos, Rhythm FM in Abuja & Port-Harcourt, BCA Umuahia and Freedom FM Kano. On television, Illrymz is the host of "Nigerian Idol" alongside Tiwa Savage.
Early Life.
At the age of 3, he was already introduced to lights and cameras as a baby model for an American beauty product. 
From an early age he sang in the church choir, and always had a lead or major role in the church drama. 
The name ‘ILL’ was created in his final years of High School in 2000–2001, when his peers would comment on his flows by saying they were ‘ILL’. ‘The name came as a relief to me for real’ Illrymz said. ‘My family called me Bardia but my friends at school all called me Bola because it was easier to pronounce I guess lol’. Putting two and two together he picked up on the tag and started using the pseudo name ‘Illrymz’ meaning ‘Sick rhymes’, ‘Dope rapper’, “the Illest’ etc.
Career.
Fresh out of high school and still filled with passion for freestyling, drumming on desks and writing music,he met Emmanuel Essien( aka Mannie) of Cool FM by chance, while working on a radio commercial for Gold Circle condoms. The two bonded as Mannie was a music composer and Illrymz was learning how to use his rhymes to write copy for advertising agencies. Immediately work on his first album started. However, the album was never completed. Shortly after this, he was introduced to another Emmanuel by his brother, this time a tongue twisting rapper called Mannie-X. 
They were later joined by Leo Abulu( aka Luvdaddy) who was a close friend of Mannie. They became a Gospel Group called SOL later in the year. After recording four songs, the group decided to rebrand and started working on a new album under a new name KONFUSED. Once again, six songs into the album, the project was abandoned. 
The first time he was in the spotlight nationally however, was in 2003 when he appeared in television and print commercials for Coca- Cola. He went on to model for Benson and Hedges, MTN, and other top Nigerian brands, as well as appearing on the runway on big shows such as the Nigerian Fashion Show and Fashion Week. 
Illrymz went on to study Mass Communication at the University of Lagos in 2006.
In 2005, Illrymz, as a brand name, was born with the launch of Nigeria’s First Online Entertainment Magazine – VibeWeekly. Working with Mtech Communications on the Vibedownloads brand for three years, he quickly made a name for himself as one of Nigeria’s foremost entertainment writers, reaching to about 60,000 subscribers weekly.
TV.
He made his television debut as the Host of Nokia First Chance, in 2007. After rave reviews and by popular demand, he decided to take on TV as a profession.
Later in 2007, he signed on to popular urban Nigerian music and lifestyle channel Nigezie as Music Content producer, brand manager, and On-Air Personality. During his short stint with Nigezie he managed to set up its 24-hour program schedule, and give the channel its first feel of international celebrity interviews bringing on Grammy Award winners - Black Eyed Peas, Lil' Kim, Brick & Lace and Amerie. 
In 2008, he signed a television deal with Soundcity and quickly became a household name. 
He made his mark as one of Nigeria’s top urban TV personalities, by hosting high profile Red Carpet events, presenting the Global Countdown show, Sprite Triple Slam, and One on One - the celebrity interview show. Also, he produced and presented the most watched Soundcity program in 2009 - The Nokia Express Music show! 
By the time he was ready to leave Soundcity, he had interviewed every top Nigerian music super star, as well as international celebrities such as Ja Rule. His one on one interview with Ja Rule was one of the very first 30 minutes straight talk interview by a Nigerian TV presenter and an international rapper. This further propelled his brand as the go-to-guy for interviews.
He interviewed Hip hop legend Nas, at the maiden edition of the SoundCity Music Video Awards, US rapper MIMS of This Is Why I’m Hot, Sean Kingston, Sisqo, SWV, Chaka Khan, JOZI from SA, Wyre from Kenya, Freshly Ground from SA, and lots more.
In 2010 he got another multi-million naira Network Television deal as the Host of the G-Bam show. Although the show was highly rated and loved by viewers it was cancelled abruptly, this led Illrymz to take a break from television for the rest of the year. 
In 2011 he made his return to TV as the new host of international music franchise,Nigerian Idol. He hosted the second season, alongside popular Nigerian RnB musician, Tiwa Savage
Radio.
In 2008, international urban music and lifestyle brand MTV announced its intention to kick off an all-African music award show tagged The MAMAS(acronym for MTV Africa Music Awards), the biggest Award show in Africa. Illrymz produced the radio adverts for the show and went on to produce the 2008 and 2009 MTV MAMA award radio commercials. 
He has also produced radio commercials for other top brands such as Nokia, Chicken Republic, Zain (now Airtel), and lots more.
In 2009 he convinced Tajudeen Adepetu,CEO of Soundcity to expand the television brand into radio. In early 2009 Soundcity Radio was born.Illrymz brought together the channels ambassadors – Denrele Edun, S-Dot, and Yinka and set-up1-hour daily shows that ran on local radio stations from Monday to Sunday every week. 
The radio channel started off with music rotation and later transitioned into shows produced by illrymz such as; Nokia Top 5 Playlist hosted by illrymz, Sexy Tuesday hosted by Luvchild (the only non-Soundcity ambassador), Your Africa playlist hosted by S-Dot, The Entertainer hosted by Denrele, etc. The channel however closed down when illrymz resigned his position. 
Later that year, he re-branded himself as ‘The Big Homie’ and launched his own independent radio show sponsored by Nokia,Radio Outloud with Nokia hit the airwaves late 2009 and is still one of the most celebrated radio shows in the country to date. Starting off on two stations in Lagos the show has now expanded to six stations across Nigeria and is still growing. The show is Nigeria’s first reality radio format that showcases celebrities in out of the normal scenarios and gives the listeners a rare peak into the real world of their favourite superstars.
The show has had hit seasons that featured; musicians, actors, comedians, and producers and also some international stars such as UK funky house sensation Donaeo, Jiggs from choice Fm London, Jimmie Jean Louis (The Haitian from Heroes & Mr Tunde from Phat Girls), Razz B (Movie star from DOOM alongside D’Rock) and Nate Parker from Great Debaters (which features Denzel Washington). 
Music.
In 2006 he released his first solo single produced by his friend PAPILASTIC titled NO MAGO MAGO! This hilarious sing-along became an instant hit and enjoyed heavy radio air-play. ‘NO MAGO MAGO NO WAYO O…NO COME PUT SAND SAND FOR MY GARRI O’ these lines became a popular slogan all over the country. Due to a hectic work schedule and reasons beyond his control illrymz went on a five year hiatus from music.
In late 2011 he leaked a single titled ANYHOW produced by Nigerian Super Producer Dr. Frabz. The song gained unprecedented followership online and on radio stations in Nigeria. Two viral singles followed shortly after; PA DA WA featuring Dr.Frabs and Skales, and Feel My Parol produced by Sam Klef. 
However, in 2012 illrymz released his first official single ‘TEACHER TEACHER’ featuring the Legend Femi Kuti. Since its release it has generated a heavy buzz on major websites and blogs across the county, and the song and video are currently enjoying heavy rotation on local radio and TV stations. 
He is currently working on his debut album.

Finite subdivision rule

In mathematics, a finite subdivision rule is a recursive way of dividing a polygon or other two-dimensional shape into smaller and smaller pieces. Subdivision rules in a sense are generalizations of fractals. Instead of repeating exactly the same design over and over, they have slight variations in each stage, allowing a richer structure while maintaining the elegant style of fractals. Subdivision rules have been used in architecture, biology, and computer science, as well as in the study of hyperbolic manifolds. Substitution tilings are a well-studied type of subdivision rule.
Definition.
A subdivision rule takes a tiling of the plane by polygons and turns it into a new tiling by subdividing each polygon into smaller polygons. It is finite if there are only finitely many ways that every polygon can subdivide. Each way of subdividing a tile is called a tile type. Each tile type is represented by a label (usually a letter). Every tile type subdivides into smaller tile types. Each edge also gets subdivided according to finitely many edge types. Finite subdivision rules can only subdivide tilings that are made up of polygons labelled by tile types. Such tilings are called subdivision complexes for the subdivision rule. Given any subdivision complex for a subdivision rule, we can subdivide it over and over again to get a sequence of tilings.
For instance, binary subdivision has one tile type and one edge type:
Since the only tile type is a quadrilateral, binary subdivision can only subdivide tilings made up of quadrilaterals. This means that the only subdivision complexes are tilings by quadrilaterals. The tiling can be regular, but doesn't have to be:
Here we start with a complex made of four quadrilaterals and subdivide it twice. All quadrilaterals are type A tiles.
Examples of finite subdivision rules.
Barycentric subdivision is an example of a subdivision rule with one edge type (that gets subdivided into two edges) and one tile type (a triangle that gets subdivided into 6 smaller triangles). Any triangulated surface is a barycentric subdivision complex.
The Penrose tiling can be generated by a subdivision rule on a set of four tile types (the curved lines in the table below only help to show how the tiles fit together):
Certain rational maps give rise to finite subdivision rules. This includes most Lattès maps.
Every prime, non-split alternating knot or link complement has a subdivision rule, with some tiles that do not subdivide, corresponding to the boundary of the link complement. The subdivision rules show what the night sky would look like to someone living in a knot complement; because the universe wraps around itself (i.e. is not simply connected), an observer would see the visible universe repeat itself in an infinite pattern. The subdivision rule describes that pattern.
The subdivision rule looks different for different geomegries. This is a subdivision rule for the trefoil knot, which is not a hyperbolic knot:
 
And this is the subdivision rule for the Borromean rings, which is hyperbolic:
In each case, the subdivision rule would act on some tiling of a sphere (i.e. the night sky), but it is easier to just draw a small part of the night sky, corresponding to a single tile being repeatedly subdivided. This is what happens for the trefoil knot:
And for the Borromean rings: 
Subdivision Rules in Higher Dimensions.
Subdivision rules can easily be generalized to other dimensions. For instance, barycentric subdivision is used in all dimensions. Also, binary subdivision can be generalized to other dimensions (where hypercubes get divided by every midplane), as in the proof of the Heine-Borel theorem.
Rigorous definition.
A finite subdivision rule formula_1 consists of the following.
1. A finite 2-dimensional CW complex formula_2, called the subdivision complex, with a fixed cell structure such that formula_2 is the union of its closed 2-cells. We assume that for each closed 2-cell formula_4 of formula_2 there is a CW structure formula_6 on a closed 2-disk such that formula_6 has at least two vertices, the vertices and edges of formula_6 are contained in formula_9, and the characteristic map formula_10 which maps onto formula_4 restricts to a homeomorphism onto each open cell.
2. A finite two dimensional CW complex formula_12, which is a subdivision of formula_2.
3.A continuous cellular map formula_14 called the subdivision map, whose restriction to every open cell is a homeomorphism.
Each CW complex formula_6 in the definition above (with its given characteristic map formula_16) is called a tile type.
An formula_17-complex for a subdivision rule formula_17 is a 2-dimensional CW complex formula_19 which is the union of its closed 2-cells, together with a continuous cellular map formula_20 whose restriction to each open cell is a homeomorphism. We can subdivide formula_19 into a complex formula_22 by requiring that the induced map formula_23 restricts to a homeomorphism onto each open cell. formula_22 is again an formula_17-complex with map formula_26. By repeating this process, we obtain a sequence of subdivided formula_17-complexes formula_28 with maps formula_29.
Binary subdivision is one example:
The subdivision complex can be created by gluing together the opposite edges of the square, making the subdivision complex formula_2 into a torus. The subdivision map formula_31 is the doubling map on the torus, wrapping the meridian around itself twice and the longitude around itself twice. This is a four-fold covering map. The plane, tiled by squares, is a subdivision complex for this subdivision rule, with the structure map formula_32 given by the standard covering map. Under subdivision, each square in the plane gets subdivided into squares of one-fourth the size.
Quasi-isometry properties.
Subdivision rules can be used to study the quasi-isometry properties of certain spaces. Given a subdivision rule formula_17 and subdivision complex formula_19, we can construct a graph called the history graph that records the action of the subdivision rule. The graph consists of the dual graphs of every stage formula_28, together with edges connecting each tile in formula_28 with its subdivisions in formula_37.
The quasi-isometry properties of the history graph can be studied using subdivision rules. For instance, the history graph is quasi-isometric to hyperbolic space exactly when the subdivision rule is conformal, as described in the combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem.
Applications.
Islamic Girih tiles in Islamic architecture are self-similar tilings that can be modeled with finite subdivision rules. In 2007, Peter J. Lu of Harvard University and Professor Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton University published a paper in the journal "Science" suggesting that girih tilings possessed properties consistent with self-similar fractal quasicrystalline tilings such as Penrose tilings (presentation 1974, predecessor works starting in about 1964) predating them by five centuries.
Subdivision surfaces in computer graphics use subdivision rules to refine a surface to any given level of precision. These subdivision surfaces (such as the Catmull-Clark subdivision surface) take a polygon mesh (the kind used in 3D animated movies) and refines it to a mesh with more polygons by adding and shifting points according to different recursive formulas. Although many points get shifted in this process, each new mesh is combinatorially a subdivision of the old mesh (meaning that for every edge and vertex of the old mesh, you can identify a corresponding edge and vertex in the new one, plus several more edges and vertices).
Subdivision rules were applied by Cannon, Floyd and Parry (2000) to the study of large-scale growth patterns of biological organisms. Cannon, Floyd and Parry produced a mathematical growth model which demonstrated that some systems determined by simple finite subdivision rules can results in objects (in their example, a tree trunk) whose large-scale form oscillates wildly over time even though the local subdivision laws remain the same. Cannon, Floyd and Parry also applied their model to the analysis of the growth patterns of rat tissue. They suggested that the "negatively curved" (or non-euclidean) nature of microscopic growth patterns of biological organisms is one of the key reasons why large-scale organisms do not look like crystals or polyhedral shapes but in fact in many cases resemble self-similar fractals. In particular they suggested that such "negatively curved" local structure is manifested in highly folded and highly connected nature of the brain and the lung tissue.
Cannon's conjecture.
Cannon, Floyd, and Parry first studied finite subdivision rules in an attempt to prove the following conjecture:
Cannon's conjecture: Every Gromov hyperbolic group with a 2-sphere at infinity acts geometrically on hyperbolic 3-space.
Here, a geometric action is a cocompact, properly discontinuous action by isometries. This conjecture was partially solved by Grigori Perelman in his proof
of the Geometrization conjecture, which states (in part) than any Gromov hyperbolic group that is a 3-manifold group must act geometrically on hyperbolic 3-space. However, it still remains to show that a Gromov hyperbolic group with a 2-sphere at infinity is a 3-manifold group.
Cannon and Swenson showed that a hyperbolic group with a 2-sphere at infinity has an associated subdivision rule. If this subdivision rule is conformal in a certain sense, the group will be a 3-manifold group with the geometry of hyperbolic 3-space.
Combinatorial Riemann Mapping Theorem.
Subdivision rules give a sequence of tilings of a surface, and tilings give an idea of distance, length, and area (by letting each tile have length and area 1). In the limit, the distances that come from these tilings may converge in some sense to an analytic structure on the surface. The Combinatorial Riemann Mapping Theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for this to occur.
Its statement needs some background. A tiling formula_38 of a ring formula_17 (i.e., a closed annulus) gives two invariants, formula_40 and formula_41, called approximate moduli. These are similar to the classical modulus of a ring. They are defined by the use of weight functions. A weight function formula_42 assigns a non-negative number called a weight to each tile of formula_38. Every path in formula_17 can be given a length, defined to be the sum of the weights of all tiles in the path. Define the height formula_45 of formula_17 under formula_42 to be the infimum of the length of all possible paths connecting the inner boundary of formula_17 to the outer boundary. The circumference formula_49 of formula_17 under formula_42 is the infimum of the length of all possible paths circling the ring (i.e. not nullhomotopic in R). The areaformula_52 of formula_17 under formula_42 is defined to be the sum of the squares of all weights in formula_17. Then define
Note that they are invariant under scaling of the metric.
A sequence formula_58 of tilings is conformal (formula_59) if mesh approaches 0 and:
Statement of theorem.
If a sequence formula_58 of tilings of a surface is conformal (formula_59) in the above sense, then there is a conformal structure on the surface and a constant formula_77 depending only on formula_59 in which the classical moduli and approximate moduli (from formula_79 for formula_63 sufficiently large) of any given annulus are formula_77-comparable, meaning that they lie in a single interval formula_82.
Consequences.
The Combinatorial Riemann Mapping Theorem implies that a group formula_83 acts geometrically on formula_84 if and only if it is Gromov hyperbolic, it has a sphere at infinity, and the natural subdivision rule on the sphere gives rise to a sequence of tilings that is conformal in the sense above. Thus, Cannon's conjecture would be true if all such subdivision rules were conformal.

Grade I listed churches in West Yorkshire

West Yorkshire is a metropolitan county in the Yorkshire and the Humber region of England. Created as a metropolitan county in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972, it consists of five metropolitan boroughs, namely the City of Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees, the City of Leeds and the City of Wakefield.
Its area corresponds approximately the that covered historically by the West Riding of Yorkshire, and it contains the major towns of Bradford, Dewsbury, Halifax, Huddersfield, Leeds, and Wakefield.
In England, buildings are given listed building status by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, acting on the recommendation of English Heritage. This gives the structure national recognition and protection against alteration or demolition without authorisation. Grade I listed buildings are defined as being of "exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important"; only 2.5 per cent of listed buildings are included in this grade. This is a complete list of Grade I listed ecclesastical buildings, including cathedrals, churches and chapels, in West Yorkshire as recorded in the National Heritage List for England.
Christian churches have existed in West Yorkshire since the Anglo-Saxon era, and two of the churches in the list have retained elements of Anglo-Saxon architecture, namely All Hallows, Bardsey, and All Saints, Ledsham. Surviving Norman architecture is found in particular in St John the Baptist, Adel, St Oswald, Guiseley, and St Mary, Kippax. Most of the remaining churches in this list are in the Gothic style, dating between the 13th and the 17th centuries. There are four buildings in the list that are largely Neoclassical in style, namely the chapel in Bramham Park, St Peter and St Leonard, Horbury, Holy Trinity, Leeds, and St Peter, Sowerby. Churches built in the 19th century, and in Gothic Revival style, are All Souls, Halifax, St Peter, Leeds, St Saviour, Leeds, and Todmorden Unitarian Church. Also in the list are the Italianate Congregational Church in Saltaire, and, in Modern style, Epiphany Church in Gipton, Leeds. Almost all the churches are part of the Anglican denomination, the exceptions being the Congregational Church in Saltaire, Todmorden Unitarian Church, the Puritan Chapel in Bramhope, and Fulneck Moravian Chapel.

De-illumination

De-illumination is a Symphonic rock/Metal band in Bangladesh formed in October 2006. De-illumination started off with their debut album "Onibarjo", released in 2010.
Beginning.
De-illumination was formed with a vision to introduce a new genre, the Symphonic rock/Symphonic metal to Bangladeshi music. Sazzad Arefeen, one of the founding members of the band, had been working on and studying the genre since 1999. Later, Shams Mansoor Ghani, the then keyboardist of Warfaze joined his hands and the duo started to work on the genre. Around 2006, they felt that they had made enough experiments so Shams proposed to go public. They asked Samiul, the then drummer of Power Surge to join them. Anabil and Rony joined later and thus De-illumination was formed. During the experiments with the genre, Arefeen and Shams faced some technical difficulties since the genre was pretty new to the local music scene.
Singles and the first album "Onibarjo".
Before releasing their debut album, De-illumination released five singles in various mixed albums along with other Bangladeshi bands. In February 2008, they released their tracks "Choto Shopno" and "Jantrik Joddha" in the mixed band album "Dabanol". Their next appearance was in another mixed band album "Rage-1" with the track "Ekhoni Shomoy" released in August the same year. A year later, De-illumination released its fourth single "Hamaguri" through the album "Proloy".
In August 2010, De-illumination released their debut album "Onibarjo" which they claim to be the first Concept album in Bangladesh bearing the genre Symphonic Rock/Metal with a regional soul. De-illumination visited almost all the major cities of Bangladesh to promote the album. Their campaign to promote the album was titled "Onibarjo De-nation Public launch and visit tour" which got good response across the country. ABC Radio joined them as their Radio Alliance. At the seventh Citycell-Channel i Music Awards, De-illumination won the Judges' choice for best band
Later in 2012 they have released another single based on Bengali New year named as Boishakh in the band mixed album Hatiar.
Social Activism.
De-illumination have participated in different charity shows.Recently they have performed in a charity concert arranged by Bangladesh International Recovery Developments(BIRD) for street children.Half of the money was donated to Savar victims too.

The band was signed to Sumerian Records in December 2012 but were dropped in October the following year. Since their formation they have issued one studio album, '"Til Death" (18 December 2012), which appeared on three "Billboard" component charts Top Hard Rock (No. 21), Top Heatseekers (No. 7), and Top Independent Albums (No. 25). In August 2013 the group announced the proposed release of an extended play, "Live Life", it was released on 4 February 2014. Later in 2014, they announced that they have signed with Artery Recordings.

Fred Mecklenburg

Fred Emil Mecklenburg (born 1935) is an American obstetrician-gynecologist who has been active in opposition to legal abortion. He was a founder of the Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, American Citizens Concerned for Life, and chairman of the National Right to Life Committee from 1973 to 1975.
Life and career.
Mecklenburg grew up in Minnesota. His wife, Marjory Mecklenburg grew up in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota, and they were high school debating partners before marriage. He and his wife have four children, one of whom is Karl Mecklenburg, a former American football player for the Denver Broncos.
Mecklenburg attended University of Minnesota, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in 1957 and an additional degree in 1958. He graduated from the University of Minnesota Medical School in 1960 and was certified in obstetrics and gynaecology in 1968. His residency was interrupted when he served for two years in the United States Army Medical Corps. He served as Director of Family Planning Programs, at University of Minnesota at a time when they opened a clinic off campus for married and unmarried students seeking family planning services.
He had a practice in Edina, Minnesota until relocating to the Washington, D. C. area in 1981, when his wife was appointed by Ronald Reagan to Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. She had previously served on an advisory panel for the Office of Technology Assessment investigating fertility planning technologies. She later became Director of the Office of Population Affairs where she served until 1985. 
Mecklenburg held an OB/GYN position with Kaiser Permanente in Reston, Virginia in the 1980s. Mecklenburg later joined the Inova Fairfax Women’s Center in Virginia, and he is currently Chairman of the OB/GYN department.
Opposition to abortion.
Mecklenburg and his wife became involved in the opposition to legal abortion in 1967. Mecklenburg served as president of the pro-life organization Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, and his wife succeeded him in that position. Mecklenburg was a strong supporter of Planned Parenthood and urged the antiabortion movement not to object to family planning.
In 1972, he authored a book chapter, "The Indications for Induced Abortion: A Physician's Perspective", which argued in part that pregnancy from rape "is extremely rare." The chapter appeared in a book titled "Abortion and Social Justice", written in response to arguments before the Supreme Court regarding legalizing abortion in "Roe v. Wade". Mecklenburg added that a woman exposed to the trauma of rape “will not ovulate even if she is 'scheduled' to." Mecklenburg said researchers in Nazi death camps observed this effect by "selecting women who were about to ovulate and sending them to the gas chambers, only to bring them back after their realistic mock-killing, to see what the effect this had on their ovulatory patterns. An extremely high percentage of these women did not ovulate." Journalist Blythe Bernhard stated, "That article has influenced two generations of anti-abortion activists with the hope to build a medical case to ban all abortions without any exception."
In 1975, Mecklenberg testified as an expert witness in a manslaughter prosecution against a Boston obstetrician, and criticized the abortion procedure used by the defendant.
In the 1980s, Marjory Mecklenburg served as president of the National Right to Life Committee.
In 1988, Pennsylvania state Republican representative Stephen Freind, claiming to rely on Mecklenburg, publicly argued that rape prevents pregnancy with the odds of pregnancy being “one in millions and millions and millions.” Mecklenberg responded in a prepared statement that he regretted his opinions were used to support Freind's position. In 2012, Mecklenburg's 1972 article was mentioned as a possible source for similar comments made by U.S. Senate candidate Todd Akin.

Midnight (musician)

Midnight (Born John Patrick Jr. McDonald April 29, 1962 - July 8, 2009) was an American musician best known for being the vocalist of Crimson Glory.
Career.
Midnight joined Crimson Glory in the early 1980's, in 1986 their debut album was issued by Roadrunner Records. It took the newcomers only a couple of years to surpass their debut with their sophomore effort, 1988's "Transcendence", a joint release on MCA/Roadrunner. In 1991 they signed to Atlantic Records and released "Strange & Beautiful", an album which showed a commercial switch in the band's sound. Not long after the latest release, Midnight left the band and the other members dispersed and became involved with various other acts. 
For roughly 7 years Midnight remained out of sight.
In the late 90's, Midnight spent months recording a 6 song full band recording to try to secure a new record deal and some press. Unfortunately, when he left Florida and went to Texas he lost the only original master tape. To recover from this huge setback, Midnight reappeared with a low-budget EP originally titled "Songs From The Attic" which was later re-released simply as "M", produced by Tim Fredenburg and featuring Bobby Kovacs on guitar, it explored a more acoustic direction (only 500 copies were made). Once again, Midnight vanished until late 2004 it was announced that he had joined forces with Black Lotus Records to release his full-length debut solo album - "Sakada".
After the release of "Sakada" Midnight did a short press tour in Europe which also included several acoustic performances.
In 2007, Midnight joined forces with a new group of musicians including Matt LaPorte who also played with the ex-Savatage frontman´s band Jon Oliva's Pain, and Lee Harrison the drummer and founder of the Death Metal band Monstrosity who also previously toured with Obituary and is currently with Terrorizer as well. Together they recorded, in addition to the "All Souls Midnight" disc, material for a 20 song covers disc simply titled "Covers", a 36 song 3-cd set of original songs titled "M2 - Descending Into Madness", and a 24 clip DVD documenting the final recordings called "A Strange Tea Party", all of which remains unreleased. Other musicians involved in these recordings were Phil Anderson (who produced and played on Sakada), John Zahner (Crimson Glory, Jon Olivas Pain), Zane Black (Kozmic Lords), Chris Tripp (Tripp3), Ronnie Dee (Greg Billings), and Jerry Outlaw (Genitorturers, Jon Olivas Pain).
Midnight joined forces with Jon Oliva in 2008 to re-record "Painted Skies".
On July 8, 2009, Midnight died of stomach aneurysm at the age of 47.

Jet Ski Lady

Jet Ski Lady (foaled 20 February 1988) was an American-bred, Irish-trained Thoroughbred racehorse, best known for winning the Epsom Oaks in 1991. In a racing career which lasted from June 1990 to October 1991 the filly ran ten times and won four races. After winning twice as a two-year-old, Jet Ski Lady competed against colts with mixed success in early 1991 before winning the Classic Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. Her winning margin of ten lengths was the second widest in the race's history and her starting price of 50/1 made her the equal longest-priced winner of the Oaks on record. She subsequently finished second in both the Irish Oaks at the Curragh and the Yorkshire Oaks at York. She was retired to stud after finishing unplaced in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.
Background.
Jet Ski Lady was a chestnut mare with a white star and two white socks bred in Maryland by the Ryehill Farm stud. Her sire, Vaguely Noble, who was twenty-three years old when she was foaled, won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 1968 before becoming a successful breeding stallion. His best progeny included Dahlia, Exceller and Empery. Jet Ski Lady's dam, Bemissed, was a successful racemare in the United States, winning the Selima Stakes in 1982. As a descendant of the broodmare Feola, Jet Ski Lady came from the same branch of Thoroughbred family 2-f which produced Round Table, Pebbles and Aureole.
Jet Ski Lady was acquired by Maktoum Al Maktoum and sent to race in Europe. She was trained in County Kilkenny by Jim Bolger and was ridden in all but one of her races by Christy Roche.
Racing career.
1990: two-year-old season.
Jet Ski Lady began her career in a six furlong maiden race at Leopardstown in June. She started odds-on favourite and won by three lengths from Tenderene. Nine days later, she was moved up in class to contest a Listed race over the same course and distance, but despite starting at odds of 1/2 she finished third of the six runners behind Seneca Reef. In August, Jet Ski Lady stepped up to seven furlongs for a nursery handicap and carried top weight of 131 pounds to a three-quarter length victory. On her final start of the season the filly was moved up into Group One class as she was sent to France to contest the Prix Marcel Boussac at Longchamp Racecourse. She led the field into the straight but was outpaced in the closing stages and finished seventh of the nine runners behind the unbeaten British filly Shadayid.
1991: three-year-old season.
Rather than being aimed at the usual trial races for fillies, Jet Ski Lady began her three-year-old season by running against a field of colts in the ten furlong Ballysax Stakes at the Curragh in April. She started at odds of 4/1 and won by one and a half lengths and a neck from the Vincent O'Brien-trained runners Classic Minstrel and Legal Profession. Two weeks later, the filly was again matched against male opponents in the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial and finished fourth behind Runyon, George Augustus and Smooth Performance.
In the Oaks at Epsom on 8 June, Jet Ski Lady was the complete outsider of the nine runners, starting at odds of 50/1. Shadayid, who had won the 1000 Guineas was made the even-money favourite ahead of the Fillies' Mile winner Shamshir: no other runner apart from Jet Ski Lady started at longer than 20/1. Christy Roche sent the Irish filly into the lead soon after the start and she turned into the straight with a clear lead over Dartrey and Shadayid. The favourite attempted to challenge the leader, but Jet Ski Lady drew steadily further away from her rivals in the last quarter mile and won easily by ten lengths. Shamshir stayed on to take second place from Shadayid in the closing stages. The winning margin of ten lengths equaled that of Noblesse in 1963 and had been bettered only by Sun Princess's twelve length win in 1983. The winner's price of 50/1 was the biggest in the race since Vespa succeeded at the same odds in 1833.
A month after her win at Epsom, Jet Ski Lady was made the 7/4 favourite for the Irish Oaks at the Curragh. Roche sent the filly to the front just after half way and she maintained her lead into the straight. In the final furlong she was challenged by the British-trained Possessive Dancer, and despite running on well under pressure she was overtaken and beaten half a length. Jet Ski Lady and Possessive Dancer met again in the Yorkshire Oaks, which also attracted Shamshir and the Ribblesdale Stakes winner Third Watch. Jet Ski Lady took the lead in the straight and went clear of the field but was caught in the last stride and beaten a short head by the outsider Magnificent Star. On her final appearance Jet Ski Lady started a 40/1 outsider for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in October. She was never in contention and finished thirteenth of the fourteen runners behind Suave Dancer.
Assessment and honours.
The independent Timeform organisation gave Jet Ski Lady a rating of 122.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Jet Ski Lady an "inferior" winner of the Oaks.
Stud record.
Jet Ski Lady was retired to become a broodmare for Maktoum Al Maktoum's Gainsborough Stud. She was bred to several leading stallions including Sadler's Wells, Rainbow Quest and Green Desert, but made very little impact, with none of her foals succeeding at Group race level. She produced two minor winners, namely Legaya (by Shirley Heights) and Lucky Lady (by Nashwan).

× Pachyveria glauca 'Little Jewel'

"× Pachyveria glauca" 'Little Jewel' succulent plants are hybrids between the "Pachyphytum" and "Echeveria", this plant has cylindrical leaves that are tapered. The leaves are powdery blue with a of purple at the bottom of the plant and a light green at the points of the top leaves and slowly that color starts to darken the closer to the middle of this plant. This plant will propagate itself by dropping leaves, which then sprout new plants.
"Pachyveria" do best in desert and arid climates, they grow well in porous, well-drained soil. They grow well in full sun, though prefer a bit of shade in more sizzling heat of 92 and higher degrees. They are drought and heat wave tolerant, but love lots of summer time water, and hardy to around 30-35 degrees.

Mutant Herd (video game)

Mutant Herd is a 1983 action computer game developed by and published by Thorn EMI.
Description.
"Mutant Herd" involves protecting a powerhouse from an invasion of mutants. The mutants crawl towards you from multiple "burrows" located at each corner of the screen. Using laser beams, you need to prevent the mutant herds from destroying your powerhouse.
The game was even more complicated than this, however, as it was possible to enter the "burrows" and to shut them down. Once a burrow was entered, you started another phase of the game. A queen mutant and her eggs are hiding in each burrow. You must get to the eggs and plant an explosive charge, while avoiding the queen mutant, who can kill you or move your charge away from her eggs. Once you have succeeded in blowing up the eggs, the burrow is sealed. When you return to the powerhouse screen, you will have one less burrow spewing mutants at you.
The game was even more complicated yet, in that, after each burrow is sealed, your lasers get weaker and the next burrow will have more eggs and be more challenging. You will have won the game when you have sealed all the burrows and successfully protected your powerhouse.
Reception.
"Compute!" wrote that "There are enough little problems to always keep you thinking about what you'll have to do next". "Electronic Games" stated that "Mutant Herd" "may not be the ultimate VIC-20 game, but the graphics are fun, the action is challenging, and it takes at least one step off the beaten game-track". "Ahoy!" called it "a two-part arcade game with a unique twist", favorably reviewing the graphics, sound, animation, and gameplay.

He joined Nairobi People's Convention Party (NPR), becoming its Secretary-General soon afterwards. He later resigned to join the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU) as a youth leader along with future President Daniel Moi and Ronald Ngala. Shikuku was elected the Butere Constituency MP in 1963 on KADU ticket. His party merged soon later with Kenya African National Union KANU, the only legal party during the subsequent Kenyan single-party era.
Shikuku was the last member to cross the floor of the House to join the one government after the Merger of Kanu and Kadu.
He retained the Butere seat in 1969 was appointed Assistant Minister in the Office of the Vice-President and Home Affairs by the President Jomo Kenyatta. Later Shikuku was detained by Kenyatta after the minister sarcastically referred the KANU government as "dead".

Shikuku recaptured the Butere parliamentary seat the next year and was appointed Assistant Minister for Livestock Development. He retained his seat at the 1983 elections but lost in 1988. 
Kenyan single-party system started to crack in early 90's. He was a founding member of Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD) alongside Jaramogi Oginga Odinga. FORD would split soon, Odinga formed the Ford-Kenya party, while Shikuku Ford Asili with Kenneth Matiba. The 1992 general election were the first multiparty election in Kenya since the 60's. Matiba was the Ford Asili presidential candidate, while Shikuku recaptured the Butere MP seat on Ford Asili ticket.
Matiba later left Ford Asili and at the 1997 elections Shikuku was the party's presidential candidate. He did not get many votes and also lost his parliamentary seat.
He died on August 22, 2012 at the Texas Cancer Centre in Hurlingham, Nairobi., aged 79 
Shikuku was married to four wives, of whom one was still alive when he died.<>

Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici (also known as Carmelo Mifsud Bonnici; born 17 July 1933) was the Prime Minister of Malta from 1984–87. He is a member of the Labour Party. He studied law at the University of Malta.
Early politics.
Mifsud Bonnici's family staunchly supported the Nationalist Party. His brother Antoine was a Nationalist MP and Parliamentary Secretary while a cousin, Ugo Mifsud Bonnici, was a Nationalist MP, Minister and President of Malta. In the 1960s, at the height of the dispute between the Maltese Church and the Labour Party, Mifsud Bonnici was an official of a number of lay organisations connected to the Church and supported the "diocesan junta" of Church organisations opposing Dom Mintoff and his Party. He would later claim to be "a Nationalist by birth, but a Labourite through free choice and conviction". 
Labour Party.
In 1980, he was appointed as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party and in 1982 appointed Designate Leader and co-opted into Parliament and assigned the Ministry of Employment and Social Services. Later, he was assigned the Ministry of Education, a responsibility he held until 1986. In 1984, he was sworn in as Prime Minister, thus becoming the first Maltese Prime Minister since independence to be sworn in without actually standing for a general election. In 1985, he was the lead negotiator in the hijacking of EgyptAir Flight 648 in which 60 of the 92 passengers were killed.
His tenure as Prime Minister was seen as a continuation of the Mintoff years (he even retained the same Cabinet). Political violence persisted, heightened and made more intense by the fact that the elections of 1987 were approaching. Relations with the church deteriorated further on two fronts: the enactment of a Bill to seize church property without compensation, and attempts by the government to take control of church schools. In 1984, a demonstration by some workers of the Malta Drydocks, at which Mifsud Bonnici was present, climaxed when the offices of the Maltese Curia were ransacked after the demonstration had ended. He responded by calling the workers "the aristocracy of the working class". Mifsud Bonnici narrowly lost the 1987 elections serving as Leader of the Opposition until 1992 when, following a second defeat, he resigned. He held his seat until the following election in 1996. He has not contested any general elections since. 
Later years.
In 2003, during the referendum campaign for the entry of the country into the European Union, Mifsud Bonnici formed the Campaign for National Independence (CNI) and later joined the Front Maltin Inqumu (Maltese Arise Front) to oppose Malta's membership in the EU. He opposed the ratification of the European Constitution, but his motion at the Labour Party's General Conference in 2005 was rejected by the delegates. He has since maintained a low profile within the party while retaining a role in the CNI.

The Touré-Raichel Collective

The Touré-Raichel Collective is a musical group lead by Malian singer and guitarist Vieux Farka Touré and Israeli singer and pianist Idan Raichel. The group's debut album, "The Tel Aviv Session", was released on Cumbancha in March 2012.
History.
In 2008, after a chance meeting at an airport terminal in Berlin, Germany, Raichel and Touré forged a friendship and promised to perform together in concert. This desire finally came to fruition in November 2010 with the duo performing at the Tel Aviv Opera House. The following day after the concert an impromptu get together was held at a small recording studio in Tel Aviv. Joining Vieux and Idan in the studio were Israeli bassist Yossi Fine and Malian calabash player Souleymane Kane. According to Raichel, the group "recorded a mix of Malian rhythms mixed with Israeli melodies — all originals, but very influenced from both our cultures." This spontaneous and improvised acoustic recording session lasted for three hours and marked the birth of The Touré-Raichel Collective. The group's debut album, "The Tel Aviv Session", was released by Cumbancha on March 27, 2012. The group toured in North America (with Amit Carmeli on bass) in March and April 2012. The Touré-Raichel Collective completed a European tour in Fall 2012 and another European tour is planned for Spring 2013. They have a new album which is planned to be released in fall 2014. 
Reception.
The group has received largely enthusiastic critical reception. Derek Beres of The Huffington Post stated: “Touré-Raichel Collective execute their craft so diligently and passionately that spontaneous improvising results in rich and symbolic gestures of art.” David Maine of PopMatters declared: "This is the best record you will hear this year." 
The "The Tel Aviv Session" reached the number one spot on the iTunes World Music sales charts and peaked at number 2 on the Billboard World Music Chart.

Seedrs

Seedrs is an equity crowdfunding platform for investing in early-stage startups throughout Europe. Seedrs allows users to invest as little as £10 into the startups they choose online and lets early-stage startups raise investment from friends, family and other independent investors in exchange for equity in the business. Seedrs is an "all or nothing" platform where companies do not receive any funding unless they reach their declared investment target, but businesses have the chance to accept more than originally asked for in a process called "overfunding".
Seedrs allows a wider base of potential investors, among the mass affluent, access to startup investing - an asset class that was previously only available to high-net-worth or sophisticated angel investors. 
Seedrs was the first equity crowdfunding platform to receive regulatory approval from a financial regulator – the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA, formerly the FSA) in May 2012. The company is based in East London’s Tech City, with its design & development team operating from Lisbon, Portugal.
History.
Seedrs was founded by Jeff Lynn (CEO) and Carlos Silva (COO) as part of an MBA project at Oxford’s Said Business School and officially launched in the UK on 6 July 2012. Seedrs raised £1.3 million in funding in May 2012 from backers, including: DFJ Esprit, Digital Prophets and several angel investors. In December 2013, Seedrs raised the largest equity crowdfunding round ever, raising just over £2.5 million.
Seedrs's Board of Advisors includes: James Alexander (Zopa and The Foundation), Mike Butcher (TechCrunch and London Web Summit), Ralph, Lord Lucas (House of Lords), Dale Murray (Angel Investor of the Year and successful entrepreneur) and Todd Ruppert, former CEO of T. Rowe Price Global Investment Services.
Seedrs was named one of "East London's 20 Hottest Startups" by "The Guardian"; in July 2012, was "Wireds"' "Startup of the Week" in August 2012, and was named by Silicon Valley Comes to the UK as one of the top 100 UK Businesses in November 2013.

On 6 April 2012, the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) was launched by the UK Government, with the goal to "stimulate entrepreneurship and kick start the economy." The scheme offers up to 50% individual income tax relief, up to 28% capital gains tax relief and capital gains tax re-investment relief to investors who invest in eligible startup companies. Seedrs has a high concentration of SEIS eligible startups listed for investment and makes it very simple for UK tax payers to take advantage of the reliefs online.
Companies funded.
108 startups on Seedrs have reached their full investment target, receiving investment of more than £10.1 million across them. Notable campaigns have included:
Shareholding structure.
Unlike other platforms, Seedrs gives all investors voting shares in the companies they invest in. This guarantees that every investor receives on-going engagement and communication from entrepreneurs while protecting investor rights as nominee under a subscription agreement. The structure assures that investors have a say while their rights are protected and that entrepreneurs do not have the administrative burden of looking after numerous individual investors.
Investors.
Seedrs investors do not need to worry about managing their investments directly. Unlike other crowdfunding platforms, all investors receive voting shares and investments are protected using both the statutory provisions afforded to ordinary shareholders as well as contractual protections that are in place under their subscription agreements with the funded companies. The subscription agreement has such protections as: consent rights, pre-emption rights and tag-along rights. And uniquely, as the nominee for the investment, Seedrs can work to ensure that even small £10 investors receive the same rights as large investors.
Entrepreneurs.
The nominee structure protects companies from the risks that come with having a large number of investors. By pooling investors under the nominee structure, companies deal with one shareholder rather than a large number of individual shareholders that can arise from equity crowdfunding. Seedrs votes and issue consents on behalf of each Seedrs investor. In the absence of such an approach, the difficulty in obtaining consents and other signatures from each individual investor could make it nearly impossible to raise further finance.
The case of German startup Smarchive is a good example of how a nominee structure and subscription agreement can be beneficial for startups. They had difficulty raising VC funding in 2012 after having previously raised finance from equity crowdfunding platform Seedmatch from 140 investors.
Fees.
Seedrs takes a one-off fee of 7.5% from successfully funded startups which covers all legal and administrative costs from raising funds. Seedrs retain transparency with these costs and do not charge startups at any other time for any additional services.
Seedrs also takes a success fee from investors of 7.5% of the profits investors make as a result of their investment, covering day-to-day management of shares and on-going investor protections.

UMass began play in 1879 and have since appeared in two major bowl games. As they spent most of their existence since the late 1970s as an Football Championship Subdivision program, they participated in the DI-AA/FCS playoffs rather than postseason bowl games. In 2013 the team once again became eligible for bowl games upon the completion of their transition to FBS.

Jupiter (roller coaster)

Opening in 1992 (although other sources report that it opened in 1993), Jupiter was the first wooden roller coaster in Japan and the only wooden roller coaster in Japan until White Canyon opened at Yomiuriland amusement park and White Cyclone opened at Nagashima Spa Land amusement park (both in 1994). At over in length, Jupiter is the 7th longest wooden roller coaster in the world.
History.
Although Japan has had numerous notable roller coasters—including coasters that have held the record of world's longest, world's fastest, and world's tallest roller coaster—it has had relatively few wooden roller coasters. This resulted from Japanese earthquake engineering regulations that restricted the construction of tall wooden structures. It was not until after these restrictions were modified that Jupiter (and later White Canyon and White Cyclone) could be constructed.
Jupiter was built by Intamin AG out of Norway spruce lumber and it cost a total of 2.5 billion yen to construct. The coaster was also the last to be designed by noted roller coaster designer Curtis D. Summers before his death in 1992 and it was one of only two coasters that he produced with Intamin.
The roller coaster Jupiter is also notable for briefly appearing in the 1994 science fiction kaiju movie, "Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla".
Ride experience and theme.
While it is reported to be the most popular ride at Kijima Kogen, Jupiter is described by a number of sources as having a rough and somewhat uncomfortable ride experience. Single rides on Jupiter cost 1,000 yen.
Outside the ride is an example roller coaster train car, as well as a small "Jupiter" shrine in a Shinto motif.

Ralph de Gacé

Ralph de Gacé († 1051) (a.k.a. Raoul de Gacé) Seigneur de Gacé and other estates in Normandy, was a member of the House of Normandy who played a significant role during the minority of William the Conqueror.
Life.
Ralph was the middle son of Robert, Archbishop of Rouen and his wife Herlevea and as such a member of the royal house of Normandy. While his older brother Richard received the countship of Évreux, Ralph was given the seigneury of Gacé in Lower Normandy. He also held Bavent, Noyon-sur-Andelle (now Charleval), Gravençon and Écouché. After the death of Robert I Duke of Normandy in Nicaea, Archbishop Robert assumed the regency of Normandy for the duke’s young illegitimate son William. The archbishop was able to keep order in Normandy but at his death in 1037 rebellions and private wars erupted. 
One of the rebellious lords was Ralph de Gacé. In 1040, assassins acting under the orders of Ralph de Gacé murdered the chief tutor of young duke William, Gilbert, Count of Brionne, while he was riding near Eschafour. In 1043 duke William and his advisors William Count of Talou and Archbishop Mauger decided to convince Ralph de Gacé to support the duke. Ralph, now in command of the duke’s army next campaigned against Thurstan le Goz who along with the king of France had occupied Falaise. Ralph captured Falaise, forced Thurstin into exile, and King Henry I of France to withdraw from Normandy. While Ralph remained a key member of Duke William’s inner circle, Ralph was known to have made large donations to the abbey of Jumieges. Ralph died in 1051.
Family.
Ralph married Basilla, daughter of Gerard Flaitel. They had a son:
After Ralph’s death, Basilie married a second time to Hugh de Gournay.

Birpurush (poem)

Birpurush is a poem written by Rabindranath Tagore. The poem depicts a child fantasising that he saves his mother from dacoits.
In the evening when the sun is set they reach a barren place. There is not a single soul there. Even the cattle have returned home. Plodding silence reigns there. The mother is a bit afraid and wonders where they have arrived! The child assures her and tells there is small river ahead. The mother sees a shimmering light and asks her son about it. Suddenly they hear the cry "Ha re, re re, re re" as a band of dacoits attacks their caravan. The mother shivers inside the palanquin; the palanquin-bearers hide in the bush. The son assures the mother, and confronts the dacoits courageously. A fantastic fight follows in which the son emerges victorious. The son returns to mother who kisses his forehead and thanks.
The imagination now turns from this event as the poet wonders why some exciting thing like this does not actually happen in the mundane way of real life! It would be like an adventure story that would fascinate everybody.

Ogden Mustangs

The Ogden Mustangs are one of Ogden, Utah's first and only Junior A Ice hockey program. Ogden had a Junior A team in The AFHL 20 years ago. As part of the Western States Hockey League (WSHL), The Mustangs compete with teams from across the western United States including teams in California, Colorado, Arizona, Wyoming, Idaho and Texas. The WSHL offers high-level, competitive hockey while promoting affordable family-friendly entertainment to participating communities.
History.
Previously known as the Bakersfield Condors, the team relocated from Bakersfield, California in the summer of 2011, and became the Ogden Mustangs. Spurred by the possibility of planting their roots in a community with both a rich tradition of winter sport involvement and a strong hockey following, the Mustang organization decided Ogden was the place to call home.
Home Ice.
The Weber County Ice Sheet was one of several host venues for the 2002 Winter Olympics. As a result, many upgrades and amenities have been added, making it a world class facility. With 2,500 stadium style seats, a VIP lounge and a Mustangs locker room and training facility, The Ice Sheet is among one of the best facilities in the WSHL. The Ice Sheet is located in Ogden, Utah, on the campus of Weber State University. It is perched on a hill overlooking the greater Ogden Area, and is located in the same parking lot as the Dee Events Center the venue for Weber State Wildcats men's basketball.
Owners.
David and Lori Miller originally purchased the Mustangs in 2009. The Miller family has long had a passion for the game of hockey and community involvement, both of which have served them well in their tenure as owners. Prior to purchasing the Mustangs, Lori Miller acted as the Director of Youth Hockey for Kern County Hockey Clubs for nine years. Outside of hockey, the Millers own an oil well welding and a construction company based in California appropriately named DMW Industries Inc.

Sable Island National Park Reserve

Sable Island National Park Reserve is a national park in Canada, located on Sable Island, southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and about southeast of the closest point of mainland Nova Scotia in the Atlantic Ocean. Notable for its Sable Island Ponies, the island is protected under the Canada Shipping Act, requiring permission from the Canadian Coast Guard to visit. The establishment of the park means that the island, and the surrounding area within 1 nautical mile, cannot be drilled for oil or natural gas. The Sable Island National park became Canada's 43rd National park in July 2013.
Ecology.
Sable Island derived its name from the French word for "sand". It lacks natural trees, being covered instead with marram grass and other low-growing vegetation. In 1901, the federal government planted over 80,000 trees in an attempt to stabilize the soil; all died. Subsequent plantings resulted in the survival of a single Scots pine. Although planted in the 1960s, it is only a few feet tall.
The island is home to over 400 free-roaming Sable Island Ponies, protected by law from human interference. This feral horse population is likely descended from horses confiscated from Acadians during the Great Expulsion and left on the island by Thomas Hancock, Boston merchant and uncle of John Hancock. In the past, excess horses were rounded up, shipped off the island, and sold, many used in coal mines on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. In 1960 the Canadian Government gave the horse population full protection from human interference.
Harbour and Grey seals breed on the island's shores. Seal counts from the 1960s for the grey seal population estimated 200–300 pups born at that time on the island, but surveys from as recent as 2003–2004 estimated the number of pups born in that season at 50,000. The seals are occasionally predated by the various shark species that inhabit the waters nearby. Unusual 'corkscrew' bite wounds on dead seals suggest that the Greenland shark is probably responsible for most attacks here. Several large bird colonies are resident, including the Arctic tern and Ipswich sparrow, a subspecies of the Savannah Sparrow which breeds only on the Island. Many other species are resident, migratory, or transient, blown out to sea in storms and returned to land out of their natural range.
It was formerly believed the freshwater sponge "Heteromeyenia macouni" was found only in ponds on the island. However, it is now considered to be the same species as "Racekiela ryderi", found elsewhere.

Plot.
Billy, Paddy, Archie and Sam are childhood friends from Flatbush, Brooklyn, who are living in their senior years. Sam and his wife Miriam are living mundane lives in a retirement village in Naples, Florida. Archie, twice-divorced and retired from the Air Force, lives with his overprotective son Ezra and his family in New Jersey after suffering a stroke. Paddy lives alone in his Brooklyn apartment, a curmudgeon in grief since the death of his wife, Sophie, over a year ago. Billy is a successful entrepreneur in Malibu, California, who lives with his 31-year-old girlfriend Lisa. Shortly after proposing to Lisa, Billy finds an old bottle of scotch he and his friends stole in their childhood days and calls Sam and Archie, who immediately propose a bachelor party for Billy in Las Vegas before his wedding that weekend. After being given permission by Miriam to cheat on her, Sam flies to New Jersey to pick up Archie in secret. They drive to Brooklyn to collect Paddy and fly off to rendezvous with Billy in Vegas.
The quartet meet up at the airport, where Billy and Paddy get into a heated argument. They had a falling-out when Billy failed to attend Sophie's funeral. Archie breaks up the fight and demands they stop and enjoy the weekend for a change and to celebrate Billy’s wedding with a little fun because “they need this.” They head to Binion's Gambling Hall and Hotel to check in, only to realize that the hotel is closed for renovations. Billy gets his assistant to find them a room at the Aria Resort and Casino, since that is where the wedding will be held. While taking a break in the casino, they meet Diana, a lounge singer who charms the guys as they joke about Sam’s sex life, Archie’s medical issues and Billy’s young bride. Paddy begins to express his anger toward Billy for not attending Sophie’s funeral and is eventually charmed by Diana into rejoining the group over some martinis. They convince Diana to join them at The Aria where they get stuck in a traffic jam and walk down The Las Vegas Strip. While waiting for their rooms, Archie goes to a blackjack table and has a brief altercation with a cocky gambler named Dean. After Dean leaves the table, Archie buys chips with $15,000 (half of his pension funds), much to Sam and Paddy's surprise. Later, Paddy warns Sam that Archie is on a losing streak and has lost nearly $9,000. They rush to pull him off the table, only to discover that he is actually up $102,000. The trio are noticed by the pit boss and they reluctantly leave the table in fear of being accused of cheating. Meanwhile, as Billy tours the wedding chapel with Diana, he becomes charmed with her as she explains to him that she moved to Vegas because she was recently laid off as a tax attorney in Atlanta and always wanted to sing despite being a divorced empty nester.
Later, the quartet become judges of a wild swimsuit competition. They are then confronted by the casino manager, who was impressed with Archie's blackjack game; he happily gives them the best penthouse suite to stay in with their own host, Lonnie, who reluctantly accepts the job as the original guest was supposed to be 50 Cent. Upon entering the suite, Billy suggests they open the old bottle of scotch to celebrate the gang's reunion, but Paddy confronts him about his absence from Sophie’s funeral and leaves the group. That night, the remaining three go to Haze where they cut the line after waiting for over an hour where the bouncer stops them and tells them that they can only enter if they buy bottle service, which they eventually agree to after seeing more women enter the club. There, Billy and Sam talk with the bride-to-be and maid-of-honor from a bachelorette party while Archie goes dancing. Dean comes by and begins groping the bachelorette and is stopped by Archie, Billy and Sam. Dean attempts to throw a punch at Billy but is knocked down by Paddy, who stopped by to give Archie his cell phone due to several missed calls by Ezra.
The next day, while the others are hungover and recovering, Paddy visits Diana and tells her that he and Billy were both in love with Sophie when they were younger and she picked Paddy to be hers. Diana catches his eye while she tries to convince him to stop grieving and move on with life because Sophie would want it. Afterwards, Paddy joins Billy at their pool cabana and admits he needs to move on from Sophie’s passing while also showing concern for Billy about marrying a younger woman. The others join in and discuss throwing a big party in their suite. Later, Dean is brought in by Lonnie to the cabana to apologize for his behavior and is tricked into believing the quartet are four mafia members from the East Coast called “The Flatbush Four.” As Billy relaxes, the other three get fancy suits and (with help from Dean) prepare for the bachelor party and invite several people including the bachelorette party, exotic dancers, a band of transvestites, and cast members of "Zarkana". Billy later visits Diana at her job, where she tells him she is fond of him. As they walk along The Strip, Billy tells Diana that Paddy gave Sophie an ultimatum to choose either Billy or him and she secretly chose Billy first, but Billy felt Sophie was meant to be with Paddy so she went with Paddy instead.
The bachelor party goes into full force as Paddy gets ready to be social again. Sam meets the maid of honor from the night before who begins flirting with him to his delight. Archie dances with the bachelorette and other female partygoers, gives advice to Dean on how to meet women properly, and is confronted by a surprise appearance from a worried Ezra, who is later told by Archie to simply enjoy this special time with his father. Ezra calms down and accepts. As Sam and the maid of honor head upstairs to be alone, he encourages and enjoys her seductive ways but eventually turns her down as he says while the experience of sex with her would be so spectacular, he has a tradition of telling Miriam about all the wonderful things that happen in his life. In order to stay wonderful, he’d have to tell his wife about what really happened in Vegas, which would be devastating to her. Paddy tells Billy he invited Diana to the party because he likes her and wants to start anew after Sophie’s passing, but realizes Billy likes her too. They rush to meet her as she enters the party and Billy pushes Paddy into the decorative pool and takes Diana upstairs to tell her that Paddy likes her and to give him a chance. She gets embarrassed and feels like she is being treated like Sophie and “gifted” by Billy when Paddy walks in and hears the whole story about Sophie and Billy for the first time. Paddy is devastated and finds the old bottle of scotch, throws it in the trash and leaves the party.
The next morning, Paddy confronts Billy at the pool and tells him he does not know women like he loved Sophie for all the years they were together and that the wedding must be stopped. As Lisa and her bridesmaids arrive, Paddy pushes Billy into the pool and as a return favor for his being with Sophie, Paddy tells Lisa the wedding is off. Billy and Lisa talk it over while the guys have small talk with the bridesmaids who are now prepared for a sloppy drunken time with an angry Lisa. As the guys pack up to leave, Billy comes to terms with his age and admits his fear of getting old and being alone. They come together as friends again and tell Billy to go see Diana. Billy shows up at Diana's job and reveals his feelings for her. The guys say their goodbyes to Dean and Lonnie and finally decide to crack open the old bottle of scotch for a final toast.
A few months later, Billy and Diana call Archie and Paddy to announce they are getting married. They try to call Sam but he is unable to answer the phone as he is busy in bed with Miriam.

Steveston Museum

The Steveston Museum is located at 3811 Moncton Street in the heart of the village of Steveston, British Columbia, Canada. The building is owned by the City of Richmond and is run by the Steveston Historical Society. Erected in 1905 during a cannery boom period, the building housed Steveston's first bank.
Changing Times.
The prefabricated building was selected by Northern Bank from the BC Mills Timber and Trading Co. catalog and shipped down the Fraser River by barge from New Westminster. It remained a bank until 1963, when it became Dr. J.M. Campbell's medical practice.
In 1979, the building opened as The Steveston Museum and Post Office. Today, it is surrounded by traditional wooden boardwalks and contains exhibits about life in Steveston Village.
In 2010, the Japanese Fisherman's Benevolent Association Building or Japanese Hospital Office, was relocated from its previous location at 4091 Chatham Street to the adjacent space north of the Steveston Museum. As of 2012 the site also hosts a Tourism Richmond information centre.
The Museum.
The Steveston Historical Society's mandate is to portray the story of Steveston, a fishing and farming village at the south east corner of Richmond. The main floor of the building displays the Bank Manager's office with early 20th century furniture, business machines and other displays. A functional office and meeting room are located upstairs in the former living quarters of the early bank staff who also doubled as night watchmen and caretakers.
Japanese and Chinese artifacts reflect the presence of these cultures in Steveston and photo displays capture some of the heritage of one of the oldest fishing harbours on the Canadian West Coast.
The Japanese Nurses' Residence.
This building was used as the administration office for a Japanese Hospital, the first hospital to be built in Richmond. Built in 1900 by the Japanese Fisherman's Benevolent Association, it was the primary health care provider for the community and had 30 beds, a surgery ward, kitchen and staff dormitories. The facility is important as part of the infrastructure built in response to the typhoid fever epidemics that were an annual scourge of the Steveston Japanese Canadian community during the last years of the 19th Century. 
The hospital operated until 1942 and in the years following the War the building was converted into a family residence. In 2010 the Japanese Hospital Office was moved to become part of the Steveston Museum. The building is currently being restored and is expected to be completed in late 2012.

Birpurush (drama)

Birpurush is a 2010 Bengali drama staged by Kolkata based theatre group Swapnasandhani and directed by Kaushik Sen.
Plot.
The drama is inspired by Rabindranath Tagore's poem Birpurush, it was not a children's play (though it was misinterpreted like that). The play had some amount of violence in it. The story was based on contemporary social and political condition of West Bengal. A wounded soldier and a Maoist get trapped in a forest and there they both claim to be "Birpurush" (brave man). There were some characters like 'Kishen Kanhaiya', 'Buddhadesh' and 'Monmohinidesh' which mocked real life personalities. In this play Kaushik Sen acted as himself and it is a self-critical character.

<doc id="36800556" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36800556" title="Criticism of AOL">
Criticism of AOL

AOL followed a variety of practices in its early incarnation as a "walled garden" community and service provider, including its community policies, marketing tactics, terms of service and customer service. There has been criticism of the corporation due to these practices.
Community leaders.
Prior to mid-2005, AOL used online volunteers called Community Leaders, or CLs, to monitor chatrooms, message boards, and libraries. AOL's use of remote volunteers dated back to the establishment of its Quantum Link service in 1985. Some community leaders were recruited for content design and maintenance using a proprietary language and interface called RAINMAN, although most content maintenance was performed by partner and internal employees. Other community leaders hosted chat rooms and provided online help. During the time that AOL customers paid by the hour, chat room hosts were compensated in free online time for each hour they worked, though of course any banked hours became worthless once fixed-rate payment was introduced. 
Two former community leaders, Brian Williams of Dallas and Kelly Hallissey of New York filed a class action lawsuit against AOL citing violations of U.S. labor laws in its use of community leaders. The lawsuit was filed in the United States Federal Courthouse, New York City on May 25, 1999 which subsequently was followed by the dismissal of all community leaders under the age of 18 years old as well as a reorganization of the community leader program as a whole. The Department of Labor was also investigating AOL's alleged labor law violations, but came to no conclusion closing their investigation in 2001. AOL began drastically reducing the responsibilities and privileges of its volunteers in 2000. The program was eventually ended on June 8, 2005. Current Community Leaders at the time were offered 12 months of credit on their accounts in thanks for their service.
Within one decade of the class action lawsuit being filed, the class had grown to over 6,000 members citing the largest class action lawsuit ever filed against an internet based company. Currently it is the third largest class ever involved in any lawsuit on a federal level in the United States, affecting ultimately the employment eligibility of individuals in an online environment.
In February 2010, a settlement was approved by the Courts in the class action suit. The settlement included a $15 million USD payment. This payment was then divided into thirds, the first of which was attorney and legal fees. Five Million was then divided among the included members of the class which consisted of more than 7,000 individual former Community Leaders. The final five million dollars was donated to charities hand picked by Hallissey and Williams then approved by the Courts for distribution. One such charity, The Remote Area Medical Foundation (www.ramusa.org), received payments in excess of $1.2 million USD for the provision of medical services, supplies and medication for those in need within the more rural areas of the United States and beyond.
Prior to the 1999 class action lawsuit, the community leaders were informed of a change in compensation for duties performed by AOL. Community leaders would be charged a reduced rate per month for their accounts and no longer would be given unlimited access without invoice. During this live announcement via an online meeting of all community leaders in a virtual arena, Brian Williams of Dallas led many community leaders in a virtual "strike" or "sit-in" to protest the new charges the community leaders were being asked to now pay. This protest or strike is noted as the first of its kind for an online environment and was nicknamed for the row of the arena it was held in; Row 800. Following the protest, AOL terminated the online working relationship between itself and several of the Community Leaders involved. Quickly following the release of these community leaders was the reinstatement of each one terminated with exception to Williams, which AOL was not willing to review due to the role he played within the cause of the protest. During this time, Williams role on AOL was that of Guide XNT (Guide Program), CB Naked (Crystal Ball forum), VnV Naked (iVillage's Vices and Virtues Forum) and JCommBrian (Jewish Community Online Forum).
Billing disputes.
AOL has faced a number of lawsuits over claims that it has been slow to stop billing customers after their accounts have been canceled, either by the company or the user. In addition, AOL changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a class action lawsuit. Previously, AOL would add 15 seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute (thus, a person who used the service for 11 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 13 minutes). AOL claimed this was to account for sign on/sign off time, but because this practice was not made known to its customers, the plaintiffs won (some also pointed out that signing on and off did not always take 15 seconds, especially when connecting via another ISP). AOL disclosed its connection-time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours. In addition, the AOL software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged.
AOL was sued by the Ohio Attorney General in October 2003 for improper billing practices. The case was settled on June 8, 2005. AOL agreed to resolve any consumer complaints filed with the Ohio AG's office. In December 2006, AOL agreed to provide restitution to Florida consumers to settle the case filed against them by the Florida Attorney General.
Account cancellation.
Many customers complained that AOL personnel ignored their demands to cancel service and stop billing. In response to approximately 300 consumer complaints, the New York Attorney General's office began an inquiry of AOL's customer service policies. The investigation revealed that the company had an elaborate scheme for rewarding employees who purported to retain or "save" subscribers who had called to cancel their Internet service. In many instances, such retention was done against subscribers' wishes, or without their consent. Under the scheme, customer service personnel received bonuses worth tens of thousands of dollars if they could successfully dissuade or "save" half of the people who called to cancel service. For several years, AOL had instituted minimum retention or "save" percentages, which consumer representatives were expected to meet. These bonuses, and the minimum "save" rates accompanying them, had the effect of employees not honoring cancellations, or otherwise making cancellation unduly difficult for consumers.
On August 24, 2005, America Online agreed to pay $1.25 million to the state of New York and reformed its customer service procedures. Under the agreement, AOL would no longer require its customer service representatives to meet a minimum quota for customer retention in order to receive a bonus. However the agreement only covered people in the state of New York.
On June 13, 2006, Vincent Ferrari documented his account cancellation phone call in a blog post, stating he had switched to broadband years earlier. In the recorded phone call, the AOL representative refused to cancel the account unless the 30-year-old Ferrari explained why AOL hours were still being recorded on it. Ferrari insisted that AOL software was not even installed on the computer. When Ferrari demanded that the account be canceled regardless, the AOL representative asked to speak with Ferrari's father, for whom the account had been set up. The conversation was aired on CNBC. When CNBC reporters tried to have an account on AOL cancelled, they were hung up on immediately and it ultimately took more than 45 minutes to cancel the account.
On July 19, 2006, AOL's entire retention manual was released on the Internet. On August 3, 2006, Time Warner announced that the company would be dissolving AOL's retention centers due to its profits hinging on $1 billion in cost cuts. The company estimated that it would lose more than six million subscribers over the following year.
Direct marketing of disks.
Prior to 2006, AOL was infamous for the unsolicited mass direct mail of CD-ROMs and 3½" floppy disks containing their software. They were the most frequent user of this marketing tactic, and received criticism for the environmental cost of the campaign. According to "PC World", in the 1990s "you couldn't open a magazine ("PC World" included) or your mailbox without an AOL disk falling out of it". 
The mass distribution of these disks was seen as wasteful by the public and led to protest groups. One such was No More AOL CDs, a web-based effort by two IT workers to collect one million disks with the intent to return the disks to AOL. The website was started in August 2001, and an estimated 410,176 CDs were collected by August 2007 when the project was shut down. AOL CDs were recognized as No.1 on PCWorld's top ten list of most annoying tech products.
Usenet newsgroups.
When AOL gave clients access to Usenet in 1993, they hid at least one newsgroup in standard list view: "alt.aol-sucks". AOL did list the newsgroup in the alternative description view, but changed the description to "Flames and complaints about America Online". With AOL clients swarming Usenet newsgroups, the old, existing user base started to develop a strong distaste for both AOL and its clients, referring to the new state of affairs as Eternal September.
AOL discontinued access to Usenet on June 25, 2005. No official details were provided as to the cause of decommissioning Usenet access, except providing users the suggestion to access Usenet services from a third-party, Google Groups. AOL then provided community-based message boards in lieu of Usenet.
Terms of Service (TOS).
AOL has a detailed set of guidelines and expectations for users on their service, known as the Terms of Service (TOS, also known as Conditions of Service, or COS in the UK). It is separated into three different sections: "Member Agreement", "Community Guidelines" and "Privacy Policy". All three agreements are presented to users at time of registration and digital acceptance is achieved when they access the AOL service. During the period when volunteer chat room hosts and board monitors were used, chat room hosts were given a brief online training session and test on Terms of Service violations. 
There have been many complaints over rules that govern an AOL user's conduct. Some users disagree with the TOS, citing the guidelines are too strict to follow coupled with the fact the TOS may change without users being made aware. A considerable cause for this was likely due to alleged censorship of user-generated content during the earlier years of growth for AOL.
Certified email.
In early 2005, AOL stated its intention to implement a certified email system called Goodmail, which will allow companies to send email to users with whom they have pre-existing business relationships, with a visual indication that the email is from a trusted source and without the risk that the email messages might be blocked or stripped by spam filters.
This decision drew fire from MoveOn, which characterized the program as an "email tax", and the EFF, which characterized it as a shakedown of non-profits. A website called Dearaol.com was launched, with an online petition and a blog that garnered hundreds of signatures from people and organizations expressing their opposition to AOL's use of Goodmail.
Esther Dyson defended the move in a "New York Times" editorial saying "I hope Goodmail succeeds, and that it has lots of competition. I also think it and its competitors will eventually transform into services that more directly serve the interests of mail recipients. Instead of the fees going to Goodmail and EON, they will also be shared with the individual recipients."
Other members of the antispam and blogging community were broadly critical of MoveOn.org and the EFF's attempts to characterize this as a "shakedown".
Tim Lee of the Technology Liberation Front posted an article that questioned the EFF's adopting a confrontational posture when dealing with private companies. Lee's article cited a series of discussions on Declan McCullagh's Politechbot mailing list on this subject between the EFF's Danny O'Brien and antispammer Suresh Ramasubramanian, who has also compared the EFF's tactics in opposing Goodmail to tactics used by Republican political strategist Karl Rove. Spamassassin developer Justin Mason posted some criticism of the EFF's and Moveon's "going overboard" in their opposition to the scheme.
The dearaol.com campaign lost momentum and disappeared, with the last post to the now defunct dearaol.com blog—"AOL starts the shakedown" being made on May 9, 2006.
Comcast, who also used the service, announced on its website that Goodmail had ceased operations and as of February 4, 2011 they no longer used the service.
Search data.
On August 4, 2006, AOL released a compressed text file on one of its websites containing 20 million search keywords for over 650,000 users over a 3-month period between March 1, 2006 and May 31, intended for research purposes. AOL pulled the file from public access by August 7, but not before its wide distribution on the Internet by others. Derivative research, titled "A Picture of Search" was published by authors Pass, Chowdhury and Torgeson for The First International Conference on Scalable Information Systems.
The data were used by Web sites such as AOLstalker for entertainment purposes, where users of AOLstalker are encouraged to judge AOL clients based on the humorousness of personal details revealed by search behavior.
User list exposure.
In 2005, an AOL employee was convicted of stealing America Online's 92 million screen names and selling them to a known spammer.
In February 2005, the employee pled guilty to violations of the US CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. He was accused and convicted of illegally selling approximately 92 million AOL member screen names, belonging to 30 million AOL customers, to a third party, who then sold the list to many spammers.

Central American Championships in Athletics

The Central American Championships in Athletics (Campeonatos Centroamericanos Mayores) is an athletics event organized by the Confederación Atlética del Istmo Centroamericano CADICA (Central American Isthmus Athletic Confederation) open for athletes from member associations.
Team ranking.
There is an overall winner in the team ranking based on points awarded for the athlete's placings. Moreover, there are winners in team ranking in the men's and women's categories. The point system changed over the years. In the early years, points were awarded for athletes on the first 6 places (6 points for the 1st place, 5 points for the 2nd place, ..., 1 point for the 6th place). Starting in the mid 70ths, points were awarded for athletes on the first 8 places (9 points for the 1st place, 7 points for the 2nd place, ..., 1 point for the 8th place). From 2009 on, points were only awarded for athletes on the first 4 places (5 points for the 1st place, 3 points for the 2nd place, 2 points for the 3rd place, and 1 point for the 4th place).
Editions.
The following list was compiled from the CADICA website, and from a variety of articles from the archive of
Costa Rican newspaper La Nación, and Guatemalan newspaper Prensa Libre.

Buckshraft Mine &amp; Bradley Hill Railway Tunnel

Buckshraft Mine & Bradley Hill Railway Tunnel ( and ) is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in Gloucestershire, notified in 1998. This site comprises two separate locations. One is Buckshraft Mine which is near the village of Ruspidge. The other location is Bradley Hill Railway Tunnel which is near the village of Soudley.
Location and habitat.
The mine and railway tunnel comprise one of a series of Sites of Special Scientific Interest within the Forest of Dean and Wye Valley (Gloucestershire and Monmouthshire). These sites support (between them) breeding and hibernation roosts for Lesser and Greater horseshoe bats. This is of European importance. Other sites in the group in Gloucestershire (all of which are SSSIs) include the breeding sites of Blaisdon Hall, Caerwood And Ashberry Goose House, Dean Hall Coach House & Cellar and Sylvan House Barn. Hibernation sites include Devil's Chapel Scowles, Old Bow And Old Ham Mines, Westbury Brook Ironstone Mine and Wigpool Ironstone Mine.
The Buckshraft Mine and Bradley Railway Tunnel sites are mostly used by Greater Horseshoe bats, but a small number of Lesser Horseshoe bats also use the sites.
Greater horseshoe bats from the breeding roost at Woodchester Park hibernate at Buckshraft Mine which is at least 15 kilometres away.
The deciduous woodlands and sheltered valleys of the Forest of Dean and the Wye Valley provide a good feeding area, and the underground systems provide roosting and breeding sites. A ring of iron-ore bearing Carboniferous Limestone in the Forest of Dean has created a series of ancient and more recent mines which provide hibernation sites.
The citations for the series of sites provide common information.

Zero-order process (statistics)

In probability theory and statistics, a zero-order process is a stochastic process in which each observation is independent of all previous observations. For example, a zero-order process in marketing would be one in which the brands purchased next do not depend on the brands purchased before, implying a fixed probability of purchase.

The Tree Bar

The Tree Bar is a music venue and bar in Columbus, Ohio founded in 1999. It has become known for its underground music scene, and is also known for the silver maple that grew out of the roof of its main performance area before the bar's renovation in 2011. It offers an eclectic mix of local and national acts with genres ranging from DIY, indie rock and heavy metal to pop music and electronic music. For a number of years, the bar has been named one of "The Best Bars in America" by Esquire Magazine.
A number of well-known acts have performed at the Tree Bar including The Rosebuds, Times New Viking, Phantogram, Doug Gillard of Guided by Voices, Tim Easton, Two Cow Garage, Watershed and Joseph Genaro of The Dead Milkmen. The venue also plays host to an open-mic, formerly run by Joe Peppercorn of The Whiles and currently run by Shane Sweeney of Two Cow Garage.
History.
The bar was purchased by Andyman Davis and Quinn Fallon of the X-rated Cowboys in 1999. In 2008, the bar was sold to Robert Palma, after Davis and Fallon took on other responsibilities. The bar name was shortened to "The Treehouse" and management of the bar was left to Robert's son, Phil Palma. A number of difficulties arose, and the bar was closed in August 2011. Columbus Alive referred to the event as the closing of one of Columbus' "unique, beloved institutions".
Shortly after its closing, the bar was purchased by Ryan Haye of Ghost Shirt and Roni Stiffler. The bar was renamed "The Tree Bar" and the silver maple that grew out of the main performance area was cut down, leaving a large stump as evidence of the bar's origins. The bar has since reopened and is being operated by much of its former staff.

Alvarez and Marsal

Alvarez & Marsal (A&M) is a global professional services firm notable for its work in turnaround management and performance improvement of a number of large, high profile businesses both in the USA and internationally such as Lehman Brothers, HealthSouth, Tribune Company, Warnaco, Interstate bakeries, and Arthur Andersen.
History.
Alvarez & Marsal was founded in 1983 by Tony Alvarez II, former Coopers & Lybrand workout specialist and Bryan Marsal, a former Citibank workout banker, after the two met and worked together at Norton Simon Inc. They created a professional services firm focused on turnaround management, corporate restructuring and operational performance improvement in an area where previously individual executives operated. The first turnaround client of the firm was Timex Corporation. A&M grew slowly through the 1980s and 1990s with a small team of focused on restructuring based in New York and, by 1994, a satellite office in Los Angeles.
During the 2000's, while continuing to specialise in turnaround work, and continuing to take executive and Chief Restructuring Officer roles, the firm expanded its practice and grew its revenues with much of the increase coming from private equity firms that hired A&M’s for services across the investment life cycle from due diligence and performance improvement through to asset sales.
By 2013, Alvarez & Marsal had grown to approximately 2000 personnel working from 40 offices globally.
Notable Projects.
Lehman Brothers.
Brian Marsal was reportedly one of the first people contacted by Harvey R. Miller on hearing that Lehman Brothers was likely to need to file for Chapter 11 protection, receiving a call at 10:30 at night on September 14 while he was watching a football game. Marsal was appointed as Lehman’s Chief Restructuring Officer in September 2008 and in November he was named Lehman’s CEO, replacing Richard S. Fuld, Jr. Somewhat controversially, Marsal allowed Fuld to retain an office at the failed bank, "if he has nowhere better to go", although Fuld was not paid for his assistance in unwinding the assets of the bank.
Lehman Brothers was left with about 20 employees following its failure and sale of units to Barclays and Nomura Holdings and subsequently appointed a number of Partners and staff from Alvarez & Marsal to serve as interim executives for the bankrupt bank. In September 2012, there were fifty full time Alvarez & Marsal executives working on unwinding the assets, along with over 250 staff employed by the bank.
HealthSouth.
When HealthSouth found itself subject to far reaching fraud investigations in 2002 which resulted in its top management being imprisoned, the company found itself with an overstated income of $1.3 billion between 1996 and 2002 while it had suffered an actual loss of $1.8 billion. The firm hired Alvarez and Marsal to lead the 'turnaround' and to do the hard work necessary to stabilize the company so that problems could be corrected and recovery started.
At HealthSouth, Marsal who served as CRO cut 250 jobs and sold off assets like poorly performing hospitals and private jets that the business had accrued.
Competitors.
Alvarez & Marsal often competes for its traditional turnaround and interim management work with other specialty firms such as FTI Consulting and AlixPartners, and since 2001 has been competing with more traditional consulting firms for work supporting Private Equity funds.
Criticism.
Competitors have suggested that A&M has boosted its own business while restructuring failing companies, pointing to a deal with Enron Corp.'s accounting firm, Arthur Andersen as an example. While dismantling Andersen, they note A&M hired six turnaround specialists from the firm.
At Lehman Brothers, Alvarez and Weil Gotshal were noted to have received nearly $1Bn in fees over the three years following the banks collapse making the Lehman bankruptcy the most expensive in history as at 2013.

Billy Frankenstein

Billy Frankenstein is a 1998 horror-comedy movie directed by Fred Olen Ray and written by his wife Kim Ray.
Plot.
"Billy Frankenstein" tells the story of a kid named Billy Frank (Jordan Lamoureux), who is related to the distant Victor Frankenstein, along with his artistic mother, Sandy (Melissa Williamson) and workaholic father George (Daran Norris). Meanwhile, a man named Bloodstone (Peter Spellos) dreams of bringing the Frankenstein monster to life, but is now unable to because the Frankenstein castle is up for auction. He invites the Franks to move into the castle in the hopes of using Billy (who is the latest relative to Frankenstein) to bring the monster to life. Also, an unintelligent officer named Constable Frogg (John Maynard) has a family history of other Froggs capturing the Frankenstein monster, and dreams of continuing the legacy. Frogg also constantly receives phone calls from prank callers who say "ribbit ribbit". Frogg is hired by a man named Otto von Sloane (Vernon Wells), and his lady Fraulein (Griffin Drew), to scare the Franks into selling him the castle and make way for a mall.
Billy, his mother Sandy and Billy's aunt Thelma (Kristin Jadrnicek) arrive at the castle and meet Bloodstone, who introduces himself as the caretaker of the house. Billy discovers one of Dr. Frankenstein's books about life and death and finds a map of the castle inside the book which leads him into the basement where he discovers the inanimate Frankenstein monster. When Billy falls asleep in the basement, the monster comes to life. Rather than being scary and threatening, the monster turns out to be friendly and confused. Billy wakes up later to discover the monster had gotten loose and goes out to find him, as does Bloodstone, who hires Sloane's lawyer (who announced the house repossession) to find Billy and the monster. Frogg disguises himself as a cable guy and sets up microphones around the house. Billy eventually comes across the monster, befriends it and brings the monster, poorly disguised as his grandmother, through a nearby village. Soon though, the monster begins to run out of power and so Billy and Bloodstone take him back to the lab basement to recharge him.
Billy's father, George, finally arrives home much to Billy's excitement. George announces that he got fired from his job, but isn't worried because of his family importance and inheritance to the castle, but Billy and Sandy tell him that the lawyer had told them earlier in the film that they need to raise $25,000 to buy the castle, so George comes up with the idea of inviting Sloane to dinner to discuss the payment. Billy and Bloodstone try bring the monster back to life, but leave when they think they've failed, but the monster shows signs of life when they leave. Billy and Bloodstone try to hide the monster from prying eyes, but Thelma faints after seeing him. Sloane and Fraulein visit Frogg to find he has disguised himself as the monster, which Sloane takes an interest in. While out shopping, George and Sandy buy a Frankenstein monster doll to give to Billy as a present and arrive home to give Billy the doll and have dinner with Sloane and Fraulein. Finally, Sandy sees the monster for herself, who Sloane mistakes for Frogg. When Sloane is convinced of the monster's existence, he and Fraulein both flee.
The film ends with the Franks, Thelma, Bloodstone and Frogg, raising the $25,000 by having tourist attractions in their castle, complete with photos with the Frankenstein monster and tours down to the lab, where a little girl pulls the lever and electrocutes herself, making her resemble the "Bride of Frankenstein". When the Franks end up wondering what happened to Sloane's lawyer, we see the lawyer, still looking for Billy and the monster, asking Dracula where they are, and Dracula points into the direction of Transylvania, which the lawyer follows.
Reception.
The film has been received poorly by most critics and holds a 2.8 rating on IMBD. There's no approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but the Want-To-See score is currently 0%.

Vineta is one of the suburbs of the town of Swakopmund in Namibia. This neighbourhood is located to the north of the town centre and extends over 3 km along the Atlantic coast. To the east it borders on the C34 road and the Tamariskia neighbourhood.
When it was built in the 1950s, it was located about 1 km north of the town centre, with only sand and some shacks inhabited by the coloured people in between. Now the centre and Vineta form a contiguous area.
Most houses in Vineta originally belonged to white people in the inland, and the houses were used as holiday houses.

Swakopmund Waterfront.
A neighbourhood called Swakopmund Waterfront in a certain part of Vineta has been planned since 2002, but due to financial problems the construction began only in 2007. In 2004, the Waterfront was elevated to the status of a separate district, whereas earlier it had been part of Vineta. Finally plans to build a 16,000 square meter area were approved. The construction is to be done by the South African company Safari Developments, worth 400 to 500 million Namibian dollars.
Finnish Private School.
Finnish missionary children went to school in Swakopmund since 1945. As soon as the construction of the Vineta neighbourhood began, a school building for the Finnish Private School was built in Vineta. The school operated there from 1950 to 1989 excluding the school year 1986–87. The school had grades 1–9. With one exception, the students were children of the employees of the Finnish Missionary Society, whose parents lived mostly in Ovamboland and Kavango.

Wilfrid Leng

Wilfrid Spencer Leng (October 21, 1952 - August 30, 2002) was a mathematician and writer who contributed his 'Theory of Everything' to the search for a Unified Field Theory that would combine Einstein's General Theory of Relativity with quantum mechanics. 
Born in Croydon in 1952, Leng was educated at Dulwich College in London and then at Magdalene College, Cambridge. In 1983, he published his collection of verse, "Sing England to Italy". These poems were described by the Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman as "deeply felt and... very beautiful". Leng taught creative writing, and as a further education teacher, he delivered such diverse subjects as philosophy, cosmology, science and history, and gave the annual Einstein Lectures at Croydon College. However, his major preoccupation was with mathematical physics, and after delivering papers to a number of major mathematical conferences during the 1990s, in 1999 Leng produced his "The Theory-of-Everything Equation", in which "all things originate in and constantly communicate with a 'multiverse' that produces 'points' which turn, thus producing the cosmos".
Leng died in London in 2002, after contracting an illness while attending a mathematical conference in Beijing.

Phyllis J. Tilley Memorial Bridge

The Phyllis J. Tilley Memorial Bridge is a pedestrian bridge in Fort Worth, Texas.
Description.
The Phyllis J. Tilley Memorial Bridge crosses over the Trinity River connecting Trinity Park to a new trail that terminates in downtown Fort Worth.
This 368’ (112m) long steel stressed ribbon/arch combination bridge is the first of its kind in North America. A steel arch with a span of 163’ (49.5m) supports steel stress ribbons and precast concrete planks over the river complementing the adjacent historic Lancaster Avenue vehicular bridge. The arch spans the entire river and the steel stress ribbons rest upon the arch. The minimal sag profile of the stressed ribbons creates major tension loads which are balanced against the thrust loading in the opposite direction caused by the steel arch. The balancing of these opposing loads minimizes the required size of the foundations. Pre-fabricated concrete planks have been anchored directly to the steel stress ribbons to form the bridge walkway, eliminating the need for temporary scaffolding in the river and on the adjacent shorelines. The absence of vertical support struts reduces horizontal loads created by periodical river flooding. At night, the bridge is illuminated by a combination of white and blue LED lighting. 
Design and construction.
The Phyllis J. Tilley Memorial Bridge was completed in 2012, with Freese and Nichols as the Lead Engineering Firm and Engineer of Record. Bridge Architect Miguel Rosales of Boston-based transportation architects Rosales + Partners provided the Conceptual Design, Bridge Architecture and Aesthetic Lighting Design. The Freese Nichols / Rosales + Partners team also collaborated with structural engineers Schlaich Bergermann & Partner. The contractor for the bridge project was Rebcon, Inc. of Dallas, Texas. Funding for the bridge was provided by the Texas Department of Transportation, the City of Fort Worth, and local non-profit organization Streams and Valleys, Inc.

"Point Steele" was built to accommodate an 8 man crew. She was powered by two VT800 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full. After 1990 she was refit with Caterpillar diesel main drive engines. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment. 
The design specifications for "Point Steele" included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly. Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer. The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.
History.
After commissioning, "Point Steele" was stationed at Rockaway, New York where she was used for law enforcement duties and search and rescue work. After late 1969 she was transferred to Oswego, New York where she was detailed to escort Communist bloc vessels through the St. Lawrence Seaway from Massena, New York to the Welland Canal. Her first priority, as with all Coast Guard vessels, was search and rescue work. The disabled yacht "Cirrus" was towed to Sodus Bay, New York by "Point Steele" on 25 August 1969. The regular escort of communist vessels continued through 1973; after this date the main thrust of her work on Lake Ontario was law enforcement.
In 1981, "Point Steele" was stationed briefly at Key West, Florida before moving her homeport to Fort Myers Beach, Florida in 1982. 1984 proved to be a busy year for "Point Steele" with her first major action of the year occurring on 5 January. The FV "Skyware" was off Cape Romano, Florida when she caught fire and "Point Steele" answered the distress call. On 19 March, the FV "El Principe del Golfo" was seized by the cutter with of marijuana on board off the coast of Florida. Another boat seizure occurred on 10 November when "Point Steele" boarded FV "Adriana Belle" and found of marijuana on board. On 3 December she seized and sank the workboat "New Jerusalem" southeast of Miami, Florida after finding hazardous health conditions on the vessel in addition to 49 illegal migrants and of marijuana.
In 1985, "Point Steele" seized FV "Crusader" with of marijuana on 28 August. After intercepting a sailboat south of Nassau, Bahamas she turned 100 Haitian migrants over to immigration authorities in September 1985. On 14 October she seized the shrimp boat "Black and White" with of marijuana southwest of Sanibel Island.
On 31 March 1987, "Point Steele" was caught in heavy seas and sustained hull damage requiring a tow of to St. Petersburg, Florida by sister cutter . On 5 May she seized FV "My Girls" carrying of marijuana west of Cape Romano, Florida. 
"Point Steele" was decommissioned 9 July 1998 and transferred to Antigua and Barbuda for use by the Royal Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force on 17 July 1998.

Blas de Hinojos

Blas de Hinojos was a military commander of New Mexico who was killed by a force of Navajo warriors led by Narbona in 1835.
Capitan Blas de Hinojos married Maria de Jesus Trujillo.
His men were poorly paid. In 1834 he received a complaint from the detachment at San Miguel del Bado that they were not able to support themselves or their families.
In 1834 he decided to commit his troops to supporting the centralist Plan of Cuernavaca, 
and received an effusive letter from José Antonio Laureano de Zubiría, Bishop of Durango,
praising his decision.
Hinojos led a slaving expedition into Navajo country between 13 October and 17 November 1834, killing sixteen warriors but taking only three captives.
On 8 February 1835 Hinojos left Santa Fé on a second slaving expedition with a force of almost 1,000 armed men.
Narbona heard news of the invasion and collected 250 of the best warriors,
who made for the high Beesh Lichii'l Bigiizh, or Copper Pass, in the Chuska Mountains on the route that the Mexicans were sure to take.
The Mexican force, although large, was composed of poorly disciplined and inexperienced men who took no precautions.
On 28 February 1835 they straggled into Copper Pass.
Narbona held back his forces, who hiding on both sides of the pass. He told them that when the time was right and not before they would cut the long file of men into small pieces, like cutting a long tree trunk into firewood.
When the signal was given, the Navajos poured arrows into the column, those who had guns fired, and some threw stones or rolled rocks into the gorge. Taken completely by surprise, both men and horses panicked and were routed. 
Hinojos and most of his force died.
The survivors made their way beck to Santa Fe, returning on 13 March 1835.
Hinojos was succeeded by Albino Pérez.
The pass was later renamed Washington Pass, after Colonel John M. Washington, who killed Narbona in 1849. Today it is called Narbona Pass.

Renata Tarragó

Renata Tarragó Fábregas (1927-August 2, 2005), a Catalan guitarist and vihuelist, was a teacher and performer, both as a solo artist and an accompanist. She was the first female guitarist to record Joaquín Rodrigo's "Concierto de Aranjuez", and was the editor of the first published edition of the "Concierto de Aranjuez" score.
Life and career.
Tarragó was born in Barcelona, Spain, in 1927, the second of two children of Graciano Tarragó Pons, who was a musician, composer, and teacher, and his first wife, Renata Fábregas. She studied at the Barcelona Conservatory, where her first teacher was her father. Graciano Tarragó (1892-1973), who had previously taught the soprano Victoria de los Ángeles, had studied the guitar under Miguel Llobet, and also played the violin and viola.
Renata Tarragó made her first public appearance at the age of 14, and was appointed an Assistant Professor at the Barcelona Conservatory upon the completion of her studies there in 1944. In 1951, the Barcelona Conservatory awarded Tarragó the "Premio Extraordinario" for her artistic accomplishments.
Tarragó played guitar accompaniment (with credits on the labels) on numerous HMV 78 and LP recordings with the soprano Victoria de los Ángeles, as well as a 1948 BBC recording in London of Manuel de Falla's "La Vida Breve". In 1958, Tarragó became the first female guitarist to record Joaquín Rodrigo's "Concierto de Aranjuez", in a recording accompanied by the Orquesta de Conciertos de Madrid, conducted by Odón Alonso. She also was the first to edit the "Aranjuez" score for publication (1959), and Rodrigo's esteem for her was evidenced by the dedication of his "Sonata Giocosa" (1960) to her. Her father, Graciano Tarragó, published the first edition of Rodrigo's "Invocation et danse" in 1962.
Renata Tarragó's repertoire ranged from music written for the viheula and Baroque guitar to that of the twentieth century. Among her solo recordings are the works of Federico Moreno Torroba, Francisco Tárrega, Fernando Sor, Gaspar Sanz, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Luigi Boccherini. In 1962, she made the first recording of Torroba's "Concierto de Castilla", accompanied by the Orquesta de Conciertos de Madrid, conducted by Jesús Arámbarri. Unlike the majority of classical guitarists, who play notes with their fingernails, Tarragó used her fingertips.
Tarragó concertized widely in Europe and abroad (including South Africa and the Soviet Union), and made her U.S. debut in 1960. In 1962, she represented Spain at the International Congress of the Guitar in Tokyo, and received a Gold Medal for her performances. During a 1962 concert at New York's Town Hall, she played both the vihuela and guitar, and the "New York Times" noted: "A musically sensitive performer, the beautiful Spanish artist explored the ranges of tonal subtlety and nuance."
In the 1968 film Deadfall, she appeared onscreen playing John Barry's "Romance for Guitar and Orchestra" in a concert scene, as well as on the soundtrack recording. The "adagio" from her recording of the "Concierto de Aranjuez" was used by Rex Nettleford and the National Dance Theatre Company of Jamaica for their dance piece, "Dialogue for Three".
Among the guitarists who studied with her are Jaume Abad (one of the founders of the Barcelona Guitar Quartet), Glorianne Collver-Jacobson, Ernesto Cordero, Darryl Denning, and Michael Johnson.
Tarragó was married to Dr. José Antonio Osorio Gullón. She collapsed while swimming in Caldes d'Estrac, and died on Aug. 2, 2005, in Mataró, Spain, at age 77.

Ramesh Vinayakam

Ramesh Vinayakam is an Indian music composer and singer.
Early life.
Ramesh Vinayakam was born Ramasubramaniam (AKA Ramsubbu) to Tamil people Vinayakam and Valli. He went to A. M. Jain College and later graduated in Commerce from the University of Madras. He learned Carnatic from Rukmini Ramani and Western classical music from Jacob John and completed his studies at the Trinity College, London with a diploma. Initially though Ramesh took up a job as a manager in his father's friend's firm, his heart was always in Music and his ambition was to become a composer. At the office, he would continue writing pieces of music and following an incident that he considers as the turning point, he decided to pursue his dream. However, he was vainly seeking work and trying for a break, until a friend introduced him to S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, who heard his work and hired him as a "track singer".
Career.
Composing.
In 1986, Ramesh Vinayakam's first album "Prathidhvani" was released. The album was a compilation of devotional songs on 10 deities, all sung by S. P. Balasubrahmanyam. Three years later, director Moulee offered him a Telugu film, "Paila Pacheesu" and made him a music director. He worked with Moulee on two more films, "Manchi Roju" (1991) and "Aunty" (1995) starring Shobana and Jayasudha, respectively. Subsequently, he would again look for work and approach various producers and directors. Vinayakam recalls that "nothing happened" thereafter and calling it a "long and frustrating period". In 2002, director Vasanth eventually signed him as one of the five composers for his next romantic musical "Hey! Nee Romba Azhaga Irukke". Ramesh Vinayakam's contribution to the ensemble soundtrack was the song "Thottu Thottu" that was also sung by him. The same year he composed for the film "University" that was his first full-fledged project in Tamil. "The Hindu" in its review wrote that the soundtrack album was "very strong on melody" and "definitely worth a listen". Although the film was a box office bomb, Vinayakam has said he was glad that "University" had happened, since it fetched him his next project "Nala Damayanthi" (2003), his most notable film till date. Written and produced by Kamal Haasan, it featured Madhavan in the lead. For the film, he further made Haasan sing an English song in the country genre. Vinayakam then composed the score and songs for Radha Mohan's maiden feature film "Azhagiya Theeye" and "Jerry" written by Crazy Mohan. He received positive critical response for his work in "Azhagiya Theeye" in particular.
Aside from film, Vinayakam has primarily worked on devotional music. He composed his first devotional song at age 12. Since, he has worked on a number of devotional albums, including "Shambo Mahadeva", "Krishna Janardhana" and "Sri Rama Dootam" apart from "Prathidhvani". In 2011, he composed the theme song for "Nadha Vaibhavam", a grand musical event of Sri Sri Ravishankar's Art of Living. Vinayakam has also composed many jingles and numerous title songs for television, including all of Crazy Mohan's television series.
His upcoming projects include the English remake of "A Wednesday", titled "A Common Man" directed by Sri Lankan filmmaker Chandran Rutnam and starring Ben Kingsley, as well as S. P. B. Charan's next production.
Playback singing.
Ramesh Vinayakam is a notable singer, too. While he has sung songs in all his Tamil films, he has also sung playback for other composers. Under Harris Jayaraj's direction, he had performed the song "Yaaridamum" from the film "Thotti Jaya" (2005). He has lent his voice for songs from the films "Bhaiyaa", the dubbed Telugu version of the film "Malaikottai", and the low budget flick "Kadhal Valarthen", which had music by singer Srinivas. In 2010, he sang the number "Sada Siva" from the Telugu film "Khaleja" for composer Mani Sharma. Although the film did not fare well, the song became popular and Vinayakam along with N. C. Karunya, who co-sang the song, went on to win several accolades, including the Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer – Telugu. In 2012, he sang the song "Stop The Pattu" from "Moondru Per Moondru Kaadhal" for composer Yuvan Shankar Raja.
Other work.
Ramesh Vinayakam has been working for several years on a so-called "Gamaka box", a way to visually represent and notate the gamaka, which is a type of ornamentation in Indian classical music. Notation of gamakams is generally not found in the Indian music system and Vinayakam's attempt was seen as a possible breakthrough and revolution in carnatic music.

Antoine Vergote

Antoine Vergote (8 December 1921 – 10 October 2013), also known as Antoon Vergote, is a Belgian Roman Catholic priest, theologian, philosopher, psychologist and psychoanalyst. He is an Emeritus Professor at the Catholic University of Leuven. His extensive publications span multiple disciplines including psychoanalysis, hermeneutics, philosophical anthropology, linguistics, theology, cultural anthropology, and phenomenology.
Vergote has been acclaimed "the most eminent figure in the field of the psychology of religion" and "a key figure" in European intellectual movements during the 20th century.
Early life.
Antoine Vergote was born on 8 December 1921, in the Belgian city of Courtray in the Flemish province of West Flanders. After receiving his graduate degrees from the University of Louvain in 1954, he continued his education in Paris where he studied with Levi-Strauss, attended the lectures of Merleau-Ponty, and completed his analytic training under the direction of Jacques Lacan.
Psychoanalysis and religion.
Vergote was a former student of the French psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan and played an important role introducing psychoanalysis to the University of Leuven. He was the founder, along with Jacques Schotte and Alphonse de Waelhens, of the Belgian School of psychoanalysis. He has published many articles and books on the relationship between psychoanalysis and faith. He has attempted to refute those who view religion as a neurosis by showing that the tools of psychoanalysis can be used to elicit an experience of compassion and sensitivity capable of revealing truth and of giving meaning to human history as reflected in the life of Jesus of Nazareth.
Vergote's interest in psychoanalysis evolved from his philosophical background. In 1958 Vergote had already published an article on the question of why philosophers should be interested in Freudian psychoanalysis, especially those interested in Husserl's phenomenology. This phenomenology would be a returning point of reference throughout his writings.
One of Vergote's best known studies, Guilt and Desire ("Dette et désir"), is concerned with the two main neuroses, hysteria and obsessional neurosis in relation to religion, and analysed from a Freudian-Lacanian perspective. Vergote rejects Freud's view of religion as a collective neurosis, as well as his genetic explanation of religion. The core of Vergote's critique of Freud's Totem and Taboo is the problem of how obedience to the Law (interiorised in the superego) and guilt can emerge in a primitive society without Law or faith. In Vergote's view, writes H. Westerlink, the obedience and guilt can only be established by a Law. In other words, culture cannot originate from guilt, because, vice versa, guilt presupposes culture. Vergote's "marvellous and classic" study includes an in-depth treatise of several catholic mystics such as Teresa of Ávila.
Psychology and religion.
Vergote has written extensively on the subject of the psychology of religion, as distinct from his psychoanalytic perspective. Vergote views religion as a cultural reality or phenomenon and defines it as "the entirety of the linguistic expressions, emotions, actions and signs that refer to a supernatural being or supernatural beings". In characterising this viewpoint of religion, Vergote pays tribute to Clifford Geertz. Vergote focuses primarily on Christianity because, he writes, it is the dominant religion of our (Western) culture and the majority of psychological studies to date relate to Christian populations. However, he also acknowledges that if one wishes to study religion from the psychological point of view, one must then speak about unbelief or atheism. "Unbelief, insofar as it is not a pure absence of religious questions or interests, is equally a response to the question addressed to humankind by religion".
Although he is a religious man himself, Vergote's aim is not to defend any form of religion.
Appreciation.
Vergote has been acclaimed "the most eminent figure in the field of the psychology of religion" whose "deep understanding of the psychodynamics analysis of the religious attitude was supported not only by his vast knowledge of philosophical and theological anthropology (Vergote, 1974), but also by the vast and refined empirical analysis which he himself conducted". In the view of Professor Jacob Belzen (University of Amsterdam), Vergote is "a key figure" in European intellectual movements during the 20th century.
His influence on both the psychology of religion, and in philosophy, in the Netherlands has been profound due to publications and translations into Dutch and due to the fact that some of his students pursued academic careers in Leuven or the Netherlands. In this respect, Vergote has been called the "godfather of the second major 'school' in the Dutch psychology of religion".
In 1998, Vergote was made an honorary member of the Italian Society of the Psychology of Religion ("Società Italiana di Psicologia della Religione").

<doc id="36801303" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36801303" title="Altarpiece of Pellegrino II">
Altarpiece of Pellegrino II

The altarpiece of Pellegrino II is a medieval altarpiece in the cathedral of Cividale, Italy. The silver relief was endowed by Pellegrino II, the patriarch of Aquileia, around 1200 and adorns today the main altar of the church "Santa Maria Assunta". It shows Mary and the Child Jesus surrounded by archangels and groups of saints. The piece is notable for its rich ornamentation and its early typographic inscription.
Description.
The altarpiece is located in the cathedral "Santa Maria Assunta" in the town of Cividale in Friuli. The rectangular relief plate which measures about one meter high and two meters wide is made of partly gilded silver. Protected by a modern glass case, it towers above the principal altar in the choir. It was consecrated by Pellegrino II who was patriarch of Aquileia between 1195 and 1204.
The altarpiece is divided into four parts: the center consists of a triptych which shows Mary as the Mother of God (Latin "mater dei") with the Child Jesus in her lap. From left and right the archangels Michael and Gabriel rush to the seated mother and her child. The whole scene takes place under a three-arched arcade. The triptych is flanked by two departments which display, in three horizontal lines each, a total of 25 male and female saints standing next to one other. All figures except the Child Jesus are identifiable by name. A frame displaying a series of head medallions without inscriptions runs all around the triptych and the two lateral sections. In the upper horizontal frame piece Christ and John the Baptist as well as the four Evangelists are depicted. In its lower counterpart Pellegrino II, kneeling at the feet of Mary, can be identified by an accompanying inscription as the donator of the altarpiece. On the inside of the two frame boards a votive inscription composed of ten Leonine verses runs horizontally across the altarpiece.
Typography.
All inscriptions of the altarpiece were written in Latin. The font of the dedicatory inscription is overall classified as Gothic capitalis. Modern commentators agree that the inscriptions were produced by hammering individual letter punches one by one into the silver plate. Evidence for this typographic method can be derived from the observation that the letterforms comply with the criterion of type identity according to which every letter imprint must come from one and the same letter punch. The type identity is "inter alia" evident in the repeated occurrence of the faulty letter "R" throughout the text that indicates a damaged letter punch. The high relief letters stand proud in rectangular recesses created by the bases of the low relief punches; the fine edges between these recesses are a further indication of the sequential use of individual letter punches. A number of letters which are not properly aligned to their baseline provide additional evidence that the artisan worked with separate punches.
A total of about forty types, which come in equal parts in a smaller and larger font size, were employed for creating the inscriptions. The smaller ones were used for the names of the saints and the donor's inscription of the patriarch, while the names of the archangels, of the Mother of God, the abbreviations of sanctus/sancta ("holy") and the two-line inscription were printed with the larger set. The latter text was punched into eight silver strips which were strung together and nailed onto the wooden substructure of the altarpiece.
According to the art historian Angelo Lipinsky, the altarpiece may have been inspired by Byzantine reliquaries which were decorated by the same typographic technique in the 10th to 12th centuries. However, a random check with the Limburg Staurotheca which dates from this period showed that the inscription was engraved directly into the metal.
The Prüfening dedicatory inscription of 1119 is another early example of typographic text production in the Latin West. It differs in some technical details though: its plate is made of clay, not silver, and the inscription was created in low relief with (wooden) stamps, not metal punches.

Socialist Party of Canada (WSM)

The Socialist Party of Canada (SPC) was founded in June 1931 in Winnipeg, Manitoba by several former members of the Socialist Party of Canada. These included George Armstrong and Jim Milne, author of a history of the party and its predecessor. While Jim Brownrigg claimed continuity with the original party, this claim was disputed by various members of both the original party and the new party (Harry Morrison, Isaac Rab, Jack McDonald, Bill Pritchard, R. M. Roddy) . The new party adopted the policies of the Socialist Party of Great Britain which rejected Leninism, social democracy and trade unionism in favour of a belief in "revolutionary Marxism and democratic revolution".
History.
As the fractured groups of the left coalesced to form the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), the Socialist Party did not make great headway. The Winnipeg-based Socialist Party of Canada remained outside of the CCF (and its successor, the New Democratic Party), rejecting its evolutionary socialist approach as being "reformist". While the Socialist Party of Canada (British Columbia) (which was founded in 1932 by Ernest Winch independently of the Socialist Party of Canada founded in Winnipeg) joined and eventually merged with the CCF to form the British Columbia CCF. The Socialist Party of Canada remained independent of the broader socialist movement, and spread its message by holding town hall meetings, open air rallies, and distributing literature at farmers markets and street corners.
In October 1933, the party launched the "New Western Socialist Journal", a periodical, to help bring publicity to the party. The first two issues criticized the CCF and the Communist Party of Canada for allegedly compromising with capitalism. The SPC never found a reason to change its attitude towards the two parties.
World War II.
During World War II, the SPC campaigned against the war, stating that working class blood should not be shed. During the war, while the Communist Party was outlawed, the SPC continued to hold anti-war demonstrations and rallies. The party was investigated by the Government of Canada, but was never taken as a serious threat. 
The Socialist Party continued to publish socialist manifesto leaflets through the years. When funds permitted, it ran candidates in elections. In the late 1970s, the head office was moved from Winnipeg to Victoria, British Columbia. The membership of the Socialist Party continued to decline, and the party admits that it never managed to live up to the "success and glamour" of the old party. The party has not wavered from the original policies that it adopted seventy years ago.
Present activity.
The Socialist Party promotes a post-capitalist socialist society. It seeks to achieve this by distributing socialist material around the world and raising class consciousness. The party believes that socialism must be implemented everywhere at the same time in order to work. 
The bulk of current party members are in British Columbia and Ontario. It publishes a journal, "Imagine", and distributes the literature of the Socialist Party of Great Britain. 
The Socialist Party of Canada is a member of the World Socialist Movement along with its "companion parties", the Socialist Party of Great Britain, World Socialist Party (New Zealand), and World Socialist Party of the United States.

Lijo Jose Pellissery

Lijo Jose Pellissery is an Indian film director best known for his Malayalam films. He made his debut with the crime film "Nayakan" (2010). He followed it up with "City of God" (2011) and "Amen" (2013), the latter being a big commercial success at the box-office. 
Biography.
Lijo, born in Chalakudy in Thrissur district, is the son of actor Jose Pellissery. After completing the schooling from Carmel High School, he obtained a Masters Degree in Business Administration from IIPM, Bangalore.
Coming from a family with film background, Lijo started his career by making short films. He was one of the finalists of the PIX Short Film Festival 2007. He considers K. G. George, Padmarajan and Akira Kurosawa as his idols. He directed his first feature "Nayakan" in 2010. It revolved around a Kathakali artist who joins the underworld to take revenge on those who killed his family and destroyed his life. The film was praised by critics but failed at the box office. His next venture, "City of God", used hyperlink cinema as its narrative structure, and was another critical and artistic success. However, the box office fate of this film was even worse, as it was pulled from theatres just days after its release. "City of God" was one of the first films in the category of "New Generation" Malayalam cinema, although the trend was just being recognised during the same year. Had it been released a little later, moviegoers and analysts feel the film would have received more critical and box office success.
His third movie titled Amen, was a pathbreaking one in terms of its narrative style and the treatment with which it was made. With actors like Indrajith Sukumaran, Fahad Fasil, Swathy Reddy and Kalabhavan Mani delivering exemplary performances in the film, it was not only Lijo's first commercial success and it brought out rave reviews and also some criticisms. Filled with Symbolisms and underlying Magical Realisms it became one of the most successful movies to be released in 2013. Filled with slapstic comedies and folk influences, and food for thought for critics Amen made collection boxes to jingle.
His fourth project is titled "Double Barrel". The film featuring Prithviraj Sukumaran, Fahadh Faasil and Indrajith Sukumaran

St. Mary's Convent Matara

St. Mary's Convent is a very famous girls school in Matara, Sri Lanka
History.
The Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary came to Galle, Sri Lanka in 1896 for more than 11 years, there was only one house of the SCJM in Galle. The second foundation was proposed from 1906 especially by M. Tiburce De Mol Superior of Galle. In collaboration with the Jesuits the sisters, started the work, and by 1908, they finished the convent and the school. on 15 April 1908 Sr. Josephine Halewijn and Sr. Livine Van Brabant left for Matara with four orphans in order to make last minutes arrangements. Fr. Van Antwerpen S. J. the parish priest. but all student are chatar 
The remaining sisters and about ten orphans arrived on Easter (19 April)
The official dedication was to take place on Monday, but due to a heavy storm the ceremony was postponed until the following day. Joseph Van Reeth, Bishop of Galle, blessed the new convent, and put it under the patronage of Mary Immaculate.
The first community consisted of six sisters. Mother Armand Landtmeters, Sr. Winefred Cahill, and Sr. Honor Philbin and Sr. Josephine, Sr. Wilmer Walker, and Sr. Livine Van Brabant.
The original group of six sisters did not remain together for a long time. Already in 1910, Sr. Wilmer left for Kegalle to take up the management of the school. in the same year two new sisters arrived in Matara from Europe.
The first superior, Sr. Armand, had to return to Belgium in 1913 because of health problems. She was succeeded by M. Ursmer Van Massenhove, who had been already in Matara for a few years. During her superiorate the buildings of Matara were expanded, and the school acquired and excellent reputation.
The original buildings were specially designed for the sisters as convent and school. The architect was Father Roelandt, s.j. When the sisters arrived in 1908, the convent and the school were finished. According to eyewitnesses, they were spacious and beautiful buildings. The orphanage was opened for use on 17 June 1908.
Already in 1912 Ghent gave its permission to enlarge the complex. All the rooms were overcrowded and still the sisters had to refuse some children. By the end of 1913, the new buildings were inaugurated : a large dormitory and a big festive hall, that was however used as school for lace-making from the beginning.
1915 : Industrial school turned into an orphanage. The large hall is used as
refectory, gymnastics room, classroom, and at first even as dormitory. The former dormitory of the orphans was used from then on by the small boys, who were boarders.
1919 : Purchase of a piece of land, adjacent to their property. Building of a
dormitory. The sanitary facilities and the kitchen were improved, and a big room for the Oblate Sisters was arranged.
1920 : New building for the boarders and enlargement of the dormitory,
with adjacent verandah.
1921 : Inauguration of the grotto and the statue of Our Lady of Lourdes.
1926 : Blessing of the new classrooms and the new dormitory.
1927 : Blessing of the new orphanage and the new infirmary.
1930 : Occupation of 6 new classrooms.
1936 : Blessing of the new wing by the Bishop.
1937 : Demolition of the old convent. The big chapel is built.
The school started on 1 May 1908. There were 20 pupils in the English school. Besides some general classes, they also taught music and embroidery to the older girls and t women. In 1910 the English school was already recognized by the State, which was important in order to qualify for subsidies.
In 1913, the Marian congregation was established for the pupils of the English school.
The number of boarders was rather high. At the beginning of the First World War there were 82 boarders. Their number decreased during the war, which brought about financial difficulties for the sisters.
They were forced, among other things, to refuse some orphans. After the war everything landed on its feet, and in the twenties there were more than 100 boarders.
There was also a “Cambridge Class, where pupils were prepared for entrance examinations for the Cambridge University in England.
In 1929, a Kindergarten was opened, allied to the English school.
The school started on 1 May 1908 with about 100 pupils, of whom 60 followed regular classes. The Sinhalese school and orphanage were recognized in 911 as “Boarding School by the State inspection. This was rather unusual. A special grant was attached to it. In 1911, the Sinhalese school was enlarged with a 6th form, a 7th and 8th year because two teachers of the school had passed their exams for this highest level.
From 1923 on wards, a kindergarten was also attached to the Sinhalese school.
The institute is now one of the most important schools in the region.
The school for lace- making opened its doors on 1 June 1908. the orphans formed the core, but soon many local children came to the industrial school as well. Several times the pupils obtained marvelous prizes on exhibitions of lacework.

Sahdona was born around 600 AD in the village of Halmon near Beth Nuhadra north of Nineveh. He joined the Beth Abe Monastery at his youth and took part in a deegation headed by the Catholicos Ishoyahb II to seek peace with the Byzantine Empire after the Sasanian defeat in a recent war.
Around 635/640 Sahdona was shortly conscecrated as the bishop of Mahoze d'Arewan.
Defection.
It seems that Sahdona was part of a delegation to the west and was involved in a debate with the monks of a certain Non-Chalcedonian monastery. The monks, defeated, suggested that their opponents see their abbot. Sahdona accepted and after the second debate declared his conversion to the West Syrian church. He was shortly accused of heresy and deposed.
Sahdona first found refuge in Nisibis and later in Edessa. He later returned to the Church of the East but was excemmunicated by Ishoyahb II so he stayed for the rest of his life in Edessa where he died around 649 AD.
Works.
Sahdona authored the volumous "Book of Perfection" while a monk in Beth Abe and is considered the most significant work of East Syrian monasticism.
He also left several letters to fellow monks concerning monastical rules.

Kevin Sainte-Luce is a French professional footballer who currently plays as a midfielder for League Two side AFC Wimbledon.
Career.
Early years.
Sainte-Luce was born in Guadeloupe but raised in Paris, France. He moved to Wales as a teenager and worked his way through the Cardiff City Academy under the stewardship of the Head of Academy Neal Ardley. The winger made his debut for the senior team on 14 August 2012, in a 2–1 defeat to Northampton Town in the First Round of the Football League Cup. However, despite showing promise for "The Bluebirds" the 19–year–old had his contract terminated on 29 January 2013 following an incident in which he was found guilty of assaulting two girls in a Cardiff nightclub. Sainte-Luce avoided a six–month prison sentence but was ordered to pay £1,250 compensation to the girls, given a 180-hour community service order and handed a 10–week 8pm–6am curfew for the unprovoked attack.
AFC Wimbledon.
In spite of his run–in with the law, AFC Wimbledon manager Neal Ardley decided to offer the young winger a chance to prove himself, signing him on a six–month contract with the option of a further year on 31 January 2013. Sainte-Luce made his Football League debut in a 2–1 win over Bradford City on 16 February 2013 as a 64th minute substitute for Rashid Yussuff. Ardley's faith in him was soon repaid as on 23 February 2013, Sainte-Luce scored his first Football League goal for "The Dons" in a 1–0 win over Dagenham & Redbridge. The 19–year–old winger scored his second goal for the club in a 2–0 win over Morecambe on 23 March 2013. On 25 June 2013, it was announced that manager Neal Ardley had taken up the option of a one year extension on the 20–year–old winger's contract, retaining him at The Cherry Red Records Stadium for the 2013–14 season.

Margo Rey

Margo Rey (born Margarita Reymundo-Jurado) is a singer-songwriter whose original stage name was Margo Reymundo and more recently has taken the stage name of Margo Rey.
Early life.
Margo Rey was born in Acapulco, Mexico and grew up in Arlington and Dallas, Texas, the youngest of five children in the family. Her mother, Juana-Amparo Jurado, was a Flamenco dancer, and her father, Alejandro Reymundo, was a cliff diver. When Margo was two, the couple moved to Fort Worth, Texas. She was raised close to the Dallas music scene, and began performing at the age of 11.
Career.
The Early Years.
In Texas, Margo took classical music training under the tutelage of classical voice professor, Dr. Luther Stripling.
As a teenager, Rey was the lead vocalist in Debutante (or The Debs) – an all female rock band in Arlington, Texas. The band toured the U.S. as well as playing to audiences overseas. In 1988, The Debs self released an album, "These Boots Were Made For Walkin"'. In the early 1990s Margo began singing in a 3 piece, power-pop band called The Ritual. The band garnered interest from Columbia Records, but on the verge of signing, the band broke up. Margo was hired by a Dallas venue, Sambuca. She became the bandleader of a Latin Jazz/R&B sextet called "Miss Margo & The Lost Souls".
The album, "Acaba", boasted one top five and two top twenty singles as well as the number one music video for four weeks, according to "Radio y Musica" magazine. The album’s success landed Margo her first major record deal in 1997 with PolyGram Latino. However, due to corporate consolidation, Margo found herself in label limbo and for three years her album wasn’t released but she could not exit her deal either.
Musical Theater and Voice-Over.
In 1998 actor Edward James Olmos heard Margo sing and recommended her for a principal role in the bound-for-Broadway musical "Selena Forever", where she was eventually portraying Selena’s mother, Marcella.
This role launched a career in musical theatre for her and was the impetus for her move to New York City in 2000. Margo Rey's theatre credits include: "Saturday Night Fever", "Latin Heat", "Like Jazz", "Señor Discretion Himself", "Zorro (musical)", and "Canta Luna".
Margo moved to Los Angeles to pursue and create music on her own terms while supporting herself as a voice over and on screen actress. She was signed by one of the top agencies for voice-over in the country, Abrams Artist Agency, and has a long roster of national commercial spots, as well as a role in the Disney movie Beverly Hills Chihuahua. She also has been a commercial vocalist for Juniper Music and has done voice-over work in TV commercials and national advertising for a variety of companies including American Airlines, Dillard's, Frito-Lay and PepsiCo; performing in both English and Spanish.
Margo Rey and her style "Organica".
Rey’s style of music is self-described as “Organica”, explained as an unorthodox hybrid of pop music that is rooted in Jazz with deep ethno-rhythmic grooves, textural guitars, keys and lush vocals. In 2009, she self released her album "My Heart’s Desire" and appeared as a guest on the Dr. Phil show, where she performed the song "Between Us" from the album. The album received the 2009 Muse’s Muse award for "Best Overall CD Project In Any Category".
My Heart's Desire Track List
Rey's music caught the attention of two-time Grammy-nominated comedian Ron White, television personality Dr. Phil McGraw, and Michael Blakey (music producer) (former president of Virgin Records/2K Records). Together, Blakey and White formed Organica Music Group and made Rey their first signing.
A year later, Organica launched Rey’s original dance single EP called "Habit (Remixes)", which debuted at #7 and climbed it’s way to #1 for two straight weeks. "Habit" also broke into the "Billboard" Hot Dance Club Songs Chart with a bullet for nine weeks from #47 to #28. The dance EP featured seven remixes of the song by Tracey Young, DJ Mike Bordes, Rod Carrillo, Klubjumpers, and Mike Cruz.
In the end of 2011 Rey’s song “Let The Rain”, which she co-wrote with John Oates, remained on the charts for 21 weeks, peaking at #17 of Billboard magazine's Adult Contemporary chart. The track received the title of “Hot Shot Debut” on the "Billboard" Adult Contemporary chart. The following radio single "Between Us" climbed to #21 on the Billboard AC Chart right after, in August 2012.
In 2011, she also released a Christmas EP, "This Holiday Night", which broke the Top 20 of the Billboard Adult Contemporary charts. The title song "This Holiday Night" was co-written by Margo Rey and Barrett Yeretsian (co-writer and producer of Christina Perri’s "Jar Of Hearts") and is an original composition with the feel of a traditional holiday classic. The other two songs on the EP are seasonal favorites "Silent Night" and "Toyland".
Current Activities.
Margo Rey’s album "Habit", released in July 2012 by Organica Music Group, produced by Margo Rey in collaboration with Elton Ahi and Chris Wabich. Together with the latest "Billboard" hits, it contained thirteen songs, all of which are original, except "She's Not There" – a cover of The Zombies's hit.
“Habit” was recorded and mixed at "Rusk LA" by Elton Ahi, mastered by Yossi Shaken.
Habit Track List:
Margo’s latest single "Tempted", the cover of Squeeze (band)'s 1980s track, started its journey at #28 on the National AC Airplay Chart on Billboard, the week of May 26, 2013. The song is unique in that it provides an updated pop/R&B female version, after having been recorded by several male performers in the past.
Touring.
In addition to touring in support of her albums, Rey has been appearing at various clubs and venues all over the country 2010 through 2013. She was a resident at the B. B. King’s Blues Club all year round in 2011 and 2012. Together with Ron White and her LA band Margo Rey put on numerous shows entitled “Ron White Presents: Margo Rey Live”, hosted by the famous comedian himself, and with guest appearances that included John Oates among other famous musicians.
In the end of 2012 Margo Rey accompanied saxophonist Dave Koz as a guest singer on his "Dave Koz and Friends Christmas Tour 2012" tour between Thanksgiving and Christmas 2012. The tour also featured the performances of David Benoit, Javier Colon, and Sheila E. During the tour Margo performed her song "This Holiday Night" as well as the Charlie Brown Christmas song "Christmas Time Is Here".
Philanthropy.
Margo Rey is a breast cancer survivor, but as she prefers to call it – a breast cancer warrior. In the midst of battling breast cancer, Margo hasn’t stopped pursuing her music. She received much recognition after performing at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel for a special one-night event benefitting Noreen Fraser Foundation, a non-profit organization that focuses on raising funds for women’s cancer research. Being an active philanthropist, she is also the supporter of Mercy Breast Centers, “Demand Cures Today”, Susan G. Komen for the Cure, Frank Sinatra Charity, The Barbara Sinatra Children’s Center, the Armed Forces Foundation, Habitat for Humanity, and other charities.
Personal life.
Rey's brother is comedian Alex Reymundo. She is married to comedian Ron White.

Zuidveen

Zuidveen (Dutch Low Saxon: "Zuudvene") is a Dutch hamlet just south of Steenwijk in the municipality of Steenwijkerland. The population was 616 in 2008.
Location.
Zuidveen is located in the northwest of Overijssel province, along provincial road N333, called Zuidveenseweg where it passes the village. A grassland east of Zuidveen, De Kamp, is composed of boulder clay which reaches up to six metres above mean sea level and is considered to be of geological interest. Zuidveen lies just north of a nature reserve which is part of De Weerribben-Wieden National Park.
Beginnings.
Settlement of the present-day area of Zuidveen began with the arrival of peat cutters, probably in the High Middle Ages. They encountered a swampy heath. The name Zuidveen, which means south fen, is first recorded in a deed from 1386 in which Johannes Altboem donates two "roeden" of land "'in Zuytvene'" to St. Clemens church in Steenwijk; this likely concerns a peat fen. In 1460, a deed from the Bishopric of Utrecht – the legal entity that governed the territory – amplifying the city boundaries of Steenwijk mentions "'Zuetvene'".
The first settlers lived alongside a ditch called the Dwarssloot. When the work in the peat fens moved a little distance, their dwellings, which were simple constructions, would be moved along. This way, the settlement came to be located along the Langesloot.
In 1675 the hamlet had a population of about a hundred; in 1795 there were around five hundred inhabitants and in 1840 there were nearly a thousand. The number had shrunk to 590 by 1890 mostly as a result of declining employment in the peat fens; it has since remained fairly stable. Some of those who left in the 19th century went up to Friesland to work in the fens there; others left for North America.
Peat cutting.
In 1795, 38% of employed Zuidveen inhabitants worked in agriculture; 25% were artisans and 10% were peat workers. In 1832, the percentages were 40%, 9% and 28%, respectively. Some of the traditional professions included mat weaving and besom making.
Around 1550, Frisian Mennonites and other colonists joined the peat workers. As the fens began to be exploited on a large scale for the first time and the population grew, it became necessary to demarcate the areas each participant was entitled to work in.
Canals and windmills.
In order to extract peat, fens had to be drained. Many drainage channels and ditches were dug in and around Zuidveen. Such canals still characterize the landscape of northwest Overijssel. The Zuidveense Aa or Olde Aa ran through Zuidveen; it was navigated with punts and rafts.
In the second half of the 18th century, windmills were built to assist in drainage efforts. The oldest windmill of Zuidveen was the Hogewaeterensmeule; the best known one was the polder mill of Trienen Peters. The last of northwest Overijssel's polder mills, it was moved to Wapenveld in the Veluwe in 1955.
Decline.
The scale of peat cutting around Zuidveen declined from the second half of the 18th century, as peat fens became smaller and more land was converted to agricultural use. The last peat to be cut was in the Broekslagen, the present-day business park Groot Verlaat. Zuidveen resident Meine Veen (married 1920) was billed as the last "turfmeter", or peat measurer, in the province of Overijssel. He was responsible for collecting taxes on peat for the water board. With the disappearance of peat, the canals and ditches lost their function of drainage and transportation channels, and were sometimes filled in. The Olde Aa in Zuidveen, once an important transportation channel, was largely filled in in 1949-50, and the bridges which had had a social meeting function disappeared with it.
Education.
Zuidveen has had a primary school for at least four hundred years. The first teacher known from the archive is Peter Peters, mentioned in 1611. The schoolmaster was appointed and paid for by the parish (the "karspel"), whose board was made up of yeoman farmers and landowners living elsewhere. The oldest school building was likely a wooden one; later ones were brick buildings with a thatched roof. Throughout the centuries, the school building functioned as a meeting place where business transactions were done and public proclamations were read. The present-day school building dates from 1988.
When primary school reform was enacted in 1985, the primary school in Zuidveen failed to conform to the new norm of a minimum of 26 pupils. The problem was solved by closure of the school in the next-door village of Onna, so the children living in Onna went to school in Zuidveen again just like they used to in the 17th and 18th centuries.
Religion.
Zuidveen's religious make-up in 1808 was 76% reformed, 15% Mennonite and 9% Roman Catholic.
The Mennonite community.
The founding of the Mennonite church in Zuidveen around 1560 has been attributed to Leenaert (or Leendert) Bouwens, an elder appointed by Anabaptist leader Menno Simons. It is more likely, however, that the neighbouring Giethoorn-Noord congregation was the mother church of Zuidveen, which became independent after a number of Giethoorn members had settled in Zuidveen. The Mennonite community in northwest Overijssel grew fast with the arrival of Frisian peat workers.
In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Zuidveen congregation were Danzig Old Flemish Mennonites. A building on the Langesloot indicated on cadastral maps may have been the congregation's first "vermaning", or house of worship. Around 1600, the Mennonites in Zuidveen and Steenwijk were harassed by the reformed magistrates of Steenwijk. In 1774, a split occurred between more conservative and more progressive Mennonite factions in Zuidveen, and a new "vermaning" was built on the Langesloot called "Het Nieuwe Huis" (The New House). The smaller faction, which consisted of only three families, kept congregating at "Het Oude Huis" (The Old House). They held to the old principles and continued to practice footwashing. The Old House was taken over by the Giethoorn-Noord congregation in 1819 who also took the three remaining members under their wing. A storm surge in 1825 destroyed the building.
The New House was fitted with an organ in 1806. It was demolished in 1848, when Zuidveen's congregation was subsumed into that of Steenwijk, where a new "vermaning" was built which stands to this day. Its pulpit, elders' benches and organ stem from Zuidveen, as does a brick carrying the inscription "IMMANUEL Ao 1630", thought to have been part of the first "vermaning" on the Langesloot.
Disasters.
A large fire which started in a barn consumed 31 houses in Zuidveen in 1779. The event gave rise to the expression, current in Zuidveen and Steenwijk, "Wedden om een hallefien, Sevene staot in de braand" (Want to bet a "hallefien" coin unit, Zuidveen is on fire).
In February 1825 the village was affected by a flood which claimed over three hundred lives in the province of Overijssel. Epidemics in the wake of the flood further increased the death toll.
Dairy cooperative de Eensgezindheid.
Between 1897 and 1926 Zuidveen had its own dairy factory for churning butter and producing cheese. In the preceding era, farmers had had to churn butter on their own farms. A number of farmers had their own horse-powered churning mill. Butter from Zuidveen was mostly sold in Steenwijk.
The dairy factory, built by J.R. Frank from Tuk, had a separator opreated by one employee and a churn operated by a team of two. In 1900 the farmers of Zuidveen united in cooperative de Eensgezindheid, which from then on ran the factory. Under the last director, about forty farmers were members of the cooperative, which also had a number of unaffiliated suppliers. The factory steadily lost business in the nineteen-twenties and was closed in 1926, business being taken over by the cooperative Ons Belang in Tuk. The last part of the old dairy was torn down in 1975. Today, the milk is collected from farmers by tank trucks.
The omnibus of de Ziele.
The first entrepreneur to organize public transportation in the Kop van Overijssel was Jan Zijlstra, originally from Oldelamer and living in Zuidveen. In 1904 Zijlstra, nicknamed "de Ziele", began operating a horse-drawn wagonette, or omnibus, between Steenwijk and Giethoorn that seated twenty persons. A second wagonette rode between Steenwijk and Meppel twice a week. The wagonettes were also used for recreational trips and school trips.
After 1918 passenger numbers declined sharply, due amongst other reasons to the popularization of the bicycle. Some years later Zijlstra ended his transportation business and dedicated himself to raising livestock instead.
Language.
The language spoken in Zuidveen alongside standard Dutch is the Stellingwarfs variety of Dutch Low Saxon. Linguist Harrie Scholtmeijer calls it Noord-Overijssels; speakers usually call it "plat", "dialect" or "Zuudvenegers". It stands out for its vowel sound [ɛː] in many words, spelled "ae" in Stellingwarfs and pronounced like the "è" in French "père". This characteristic gave rise to the shibboleth "Et waeter klaetert teugen de glaezen dat er daevert" (The water splashes noisily against the windows).
Zuudvenegers also has features in common with Frisian, such as the sound ("skoele", Fr. "skuolle", school) and the elision of the consonant in the definite article following a preposition ("op 'e taofel", Fr. "op 'e tafel", on the table).
As an example of Zuudvenegers, an extract from Toone Kamp's poem "Woarom mag i'j neet mit eur noar Sevene goan" (Why can't he go to Zuidveen with her):

Ernest Seyd

Ernest Julius Seyd ( March 7, 1830 – May 1, 1881 ), born of Jewish parents, author, banker, and economist, particularly known for his expertise in coinage and foreign exchange, and for his advocacy of bimetallism.
The “Crime of 1873” hoax.
In 1877, a story started circulating that Ernest Seyd, a London banker, had bribed Congress to pass the Coinage Act of 1873, which discontinued the minting of silver dollars. For example, here is how the Ohio Democrat explained the situation to its rival newspaper, the Canton "Repository":
Well, Mr. Repository, let us see; here is the “evidence:”
“Congressional Record, 1872, April 9, page 2034, Mr. Hooper, Chairman of the Committee of Coinage, in his reports, states: 'Ernest Seyd, of London, a distinguished writer and bullionist, who is now here and has given great attention to the subject of mints and coinage, after examining the first draft of this bill made various sensible suggestions, which the Committee adopted and embodied in this bill.'
In 1872, silver being demonetized in France, Germany, England and Holland, a capital of £100,000 ($500,000) was raised, and Ernest Seyd, of London, was sent to this country with this fund as the agent of the foreign bondholders and capitalists, to effect the same object, which was successful.— Bankers' Magazine, August 1873”
Perhaps our friend of the Repository will question the evidence, if so,
let him turn to the Congressional Record and read for himself.
By 1890, the alleged plot had been termed the “Crime of 1873”. In 1892, the case was bolstered when Frederick A. Luckenbach gave an affidavit that, when Luckenbach had dined with Seyd in 1874, Seyd had told him just that story. At the time, Luckenbach was selling mining equipment to silver miners in Colorado. The president of the State Silver League persuaded him to give the affidavit about what Seyd allegedly told him.
Congress finally investigated the story in 1893, twenty years after the alleged crime. It turned out that there was never any such story in "Banker's Magazine" and that the excerpt from the "Congressional Globe" (the predecessor to the "Congressional Record") had been altered—Hooper did not say that Seyd was “now here” and he did not call him a bullionist. The original read:
Mr. Ernest Seyd, of London, a distinguished writer, who has given great attention to the subject of mints and coinage, after examining the first draft of the bill, furnished many valuable suggestions which have been incorporated in this bill.
Although Seyd and Hooper were long since dead, the letter that Seyd had written to Hooper was found and published. The letter contained page after page of technical recommendations, followed by an impassioned plea for keeping the silver dollar—exactly the opposite of what had been insinuated. Seyd, as it turned out, had been one of the foremost advocates of silver in England, and an expert on bimetallism. Seyd advocated for silver in all his works and had been consulted on the coinage bill because he had written a 250-page book, "Suggestions in reference to the metallic currency of the United States". Congressmen distanced themselves from the story and even issued formal apologies for their allegations.
Writers pointed out numerous problems with Luckenbach's affidavit and with the story of the bribery. Perhaps the most glaring question was stated this way, by Hermon Wilson Craven:
The bill dropping the silver dollar from our list of coins had passed the senate on January 10, 1871, by a vote of 36 to 14. It had passed the house on May 27, 1872, by a vote of 110 to 13. In the name of common sense, what need was there for English and German bankers to send Seyd here in the winter of 1872-3, to bribe congress to favor a measure that had already passed both houses of congress without a word of opposition from a single member? Granting that bankers are as willing to resort to bribery as Populists claim—and the word of those who forge government reports would, of course, be accepted as conclusive on this point—they should be credited with having sense enough not to use bribery when there is no necessity whatever for it.
In the end, the allegations of bribery seemed implausible and Luckenbach's affidavit was deemed as phony as the other evidence against Seyd. The “Crime of 1873” ended up as a footnote in the history of the Free Silver movement.

Yamudiki Mogudu (2012 film)

Yamudiki Mogudu: Ee Nela Thakkuvodu is a 2012 released Telugu socio-fantasy and comedy film directed by E. Satti Babu, produced by Chanti Addala under Friendly Movies banner and starring Allari Naresh and Richa Panai in lead roles. The film also has popular Telugu actors like Ramya Krishna and Naresh in pivotal roles. Soundtrack for the film was composed by popular music director Koti and cinematography is handled by Ravindra Babu. The film made its theatrical release on December 27, 2012. The film managed to get a decent talk from day one and this is Allari Naresh’s consecutive hit after Sudigadu.
Plot.
Because of an error committed by Lord Brahma, Naresh (Allari Naresh) is born a month early without the mandatory ‘Thalaratha’. Due to this error, Naresh does not have the normal human tendencies like death or disease, which are naturally unknown to him. He is also addicted to mythological dramas and takes part in them actively. During one such Swayamvaram drama, Lord Yama’s daughter Yamaja (Richa Panai) is intentionally brought into the proceedings by Narada Maharshi (Naresh). Yamaja marries Naresh in that play and takes him for her husband in real life too. She keeps hounding him and slowly, Naresh also reciprocates her feelings. Lord Yamadharma Raja (Sayaji Shinde) comes to know about all this and sends his son Yamaganda (Master Bharath) and Chitra Gupta (Krishna Bhagavaan) to bring her back.
As they fail in their mission, Lord Yama himself travels to Earth and takes her back. But Naresh catches the tail of the Bull of Yama and travels up to Trishanku's Heaven and with the blessings of a Disguised Narada, he reaches Yamalokam. There he befriends Ayyo 
(Ramya Krishna), the wife of Yama and gains her support by telling his story. Later again by Narada, he comes to know that Yamaja is Captured in the Gada of Yama. He however manages to get in and reconciles with Yamaja. Even after expelled by Yama from his Gada, Naresh continues to gain the support of Yamaja and Ayyo.
Frustrated, he later tries to eliminate him but he cant as Naresh had no 'Thalaratha', a script by Lord Brahma regarding Naresh's Birth, Life, Death etc. This also comes to the knowledge of Naresh and he enters as Yama Jr. But Meanwhile, Yama gets an opportunity. He accepts that he cant kill Naresh but one or the other day, his family will be killed as they possess 'Thalaratha'. Thus to save his family, Naresh begs Yama to take his life after 3 days as he may try to save his family, leaves his powers and Yamaja and returns sadly to home.In Yamalokam, he foresees his Father (Chandra Mohan)'s and Brother's Death.

Later after enquiry, he knows that his Brother, a Bank Manager, is in a debt of 25 Lakhs, which is to be paid as soon as possible which is a scheme of Royyala Naidu. Naresh utilizes a chance of playing a Drama to which he gets a Remuneration of 25 Lakhs. He Successfully plays the Drama, and his Brother clears the Debt. But Royyala Naidu enters the scene and tries to stab Naresh's Brother. Naresh also remembers that the shirt worn by his Brother at present is same as he saw in the Foresight. After a fight he changes the shirt, wears it and gets stabbed. Before Yama would snatch his Soul, Naresh stabs Royyala Naidu Fatally. He enters Yamalokam as a Soul now, but after the protest of Ayyo and Request of Yamaja and Yamaganda, Yama restores Naresh's Body and Naresh is married to Yamaja.

Kappa V Archaeological Site

Kappa V is an important archaeological site in the southern part of the U.S. state of Indiana dating from the Archaic period. Discovered because of its location along the shore of a reservoir, it has been declared a historic site because of its unusual degree of preservation, but it has experienced substantial damage from the same waters that led to its discovery.
Geographic context.
In 1965, the Army Corps of Engineers dammed Salt Creek southeast of Bloomington in southeastern Monroe County, flooding the flat areas of northern Polk Township and southern Salt Creek Township and creating Lake Monroe. The hilly uplands surrounding the stream valley remained above the waves, being changed from promontories above flatlands to peninsulas in a lake. One of the lake's larger peninsulas is located east of the former confluence of the Middle and North Forks of Salt Creek; because its pre-impoundment sides were much gentler than many hills located farther from the lake, it had been plowed frequently since the area was settled. The peninsula is located within the boundaries of the Charles C. Deam Wilderness Area.
In 1976, archaeologists from the Glenn Black Laboratory of Archaeology at Indiana University in Bloomington conducted a survey of the shores of Lake Monroe, finding more than one hundred different sites. One of the largest sites lay on the peninsula near the old confluence; despite repeated plowing, the site retained a substantial amount of cultural information in the plow zone, along with remarkably complete cultural deposits in the soil that was too deep to have been plowed. Unfortunately, the site experienced damage in the eleven years between impoundment and discovery: it is believed originally to have extended approximately from north to south and from east to west, but wave wash erosion had destroyed much of the site by 1976, reducing it to . In 1982, Black Lab archaeologists requested the construction of some sort of levee at the site, suggesting that it might be destroyed by 1990 if no preservation actions were taken, as more erosion had caused further damage in 1979 and 1980.
Discoveries.
When the site was discovered in 1976, the archaeologists conducting the survey collected a large number of artifacts as part of their observations. Besides more than 550 stone flakes, they recovered two different types of complete projectile points and several partial points, hammerstones, a chopper, a mano, and nutting stones. They also conducted a test excavation, which revealed that the ground below the plow zone was rich in cultural materials; among the discoveries from the test excavation was the presence of trash pits, which yielded both pieces of stone tools and of plant wastes. Evidence found in the test excavation led the surveyors to conclude that the materials located within the plow zone dated from the Woodland period, while the artifacts found below the plow zone were produced during the end of the Archaic period, or "Terminal Archaic". Most of the lithics appeared to have been produced locally: the floor of the Salt Creek valley was dotted with outcroppings of a type of limestone known as "Harrodsburg Limestone", which typically included substantial amounts of multicolored chert, and more than 75% of all stone tools at Kappa V were made of chert from Harrodsburg Limestone.
Years after the site was discovered, Black Lab archaeologists remained hopeful about the possible information that might be gained from a comprehensive excavation of the Kappa V Site. Particularly important was the site's nature as a habitation site: in 1980, very little was known about the Terminal Archaic period, and what was known was largely found at burial sites; known campsites with intact deposits like Kappa V were very rare, and no other Terminal Archaic site in the region retained the wealth of material that was found in the rubbish pits. As a result, it was believed that a comprehensive excavation of the site would likely be able to clarify the technological advances that today are classified as the transition from Archaic to Woodland, as well as demonstrating the inhabitants' diet and their typical seasonal migration patterns.
Preservation.
While Kappa V was seen as unique, the survey revealed several other shoreline sites that were substantially above average in their information-yielding potential. Three such sites, known as Axsom Branch, Epsilon II, and Refuge #7, were shown to have important Terminal Archaic information, and at one point it was hoped to designate all of them a historic district for preservation purposes.
In early 1986, the Kappa V Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its archaeological value. Less than a week later, the Axsom Branch, Epsilon II, and Refuge #7 Sites were also listed on the Register, although individually rather than as part of a historic district. Axsom Branch and Refuge #7 were experiencing erosion comparable to that of Kappa V at the time that they were listed; erosion continued to the point that their cultural deposits were exposed to the elements, and the sites were largely destroyed by the mid-1980s. As a result, these two sites were removed from the National Register in 1995, but Epsilon II and Kappa V remain on the Register to the present day.

<doc id="36801837" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36801837" title="Berliner Börsen-Courier">
Berliner Börsen-Courier

The Berliner Börsen-Courier (Berlin stock exchange courier, BBC) was a German left-liberal daily newspaper published from 1868 to 1933. It focused primarily on prices of securities traded on the stock exchanges and securities information about the mortgage market, but also featured news and reports from industry, commerce, politics and culture. It was subtitled: "moderne Tageszeitung für alle Gebiete" (modern daily paper for all areas).
Concept and creation.
The first issue appeared as a sample issue on 12 September 1868, while regular distribution began in October 1868. The daily issue appeared in the late afternoon, matching the trading hours on the stock exchange. On Sunday evening, the newspaper appeared under the name "Station" and was primarily a feuilleton. The daily paper had one page of political news and three pages of news and reports from trade and industry. In addition, there were four supplements: the Courszettel (stock list), advertising, the "Station" and a weekly supplement of real estate news.
Beginning on 1 January 1869, the paper came with a morning and an evening edition. The evening edition consisted mainly of the stock data, while the morning edition had mainly news and reports from the fields of politics, entertainment and culture. In the following years, the evening edition also was expanded with news and reports, also reports from the local area.
Founder and managing director.
The founder of the paper, George Davidsohn (1835–1897), was trained as a banker and was a journalist at the "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" (BBZ, Berlin stock exchange newspaper). He thus managed to make the "Börsen-Courier" economically stable. He also raised the bar in newspaper quality when it came to the speed of publication and the level of reporting. He was connected to Berlin's artistic scene and made the paper "an influential force in Berlin culture". The "Börsen-Courier" was "freisinnig", leftist-liberal, and stood against Anti-Semitism. When the economic crisis reached the "Börsen-Courier" in the years 1875 to 1877, Davidsohn's brother Robert Davidsohn (1853-1937) took over the business of the newspaper and converted it into a public company in 1884.
The increased demands for timely news led to the introduction of flexible working hours and the installment of a night editor. From the 1880s, reports of foreign exchanges were published and reports were accompanied by statistics and forecasts. The paper incorporated as a supplement the "Berliner Wespen", a paper Julius Stettenheim had created for humor and satire. The "Börsen-Courier" was the first newspaper in Berlin reporting from the Reichstag. It was also the first newspaper that had a reporter for sport, from 1885, who developed a sports section.
Culture, circulation, termination.
Reports on culture were of prime importance in the "Börsen-Courier". It was said in Germany that no theater office could do without its information. Journalists included Paul Lindau responsible for theater, Ernst von Wildenbruch for literature, Eugen Richter heading the feuilleton, Alfred Schütze and Paul Bormann for commerce, Benno Jacobsen for theater and Oskar Bie, writing on art. Joseph Roth worked for the paper from 1921. In 1922 critic Herbert Ihering made Bertolt Brecht known by a review of his first performed play "Drums in the Night": "At 24 the writer Bert Brecht has changed Germany's literary complexion overnight [... he] has given our time a new tone, a new melody, a new vision. [...] It is a language you can feel on your tongue, in your gums, your ear, your spinal column." On 20 April 1924, the paper published an essay by Franz Kafka, "Adalbert Stifter". In the two editions of 11 January 1927, Herbert Ihering reviewed the premiere of the film "Metropolis".
In the 1920s all Berlin papers were changed to a new format, the "Berliner". Beginning on 24 August 1924, the "Börsen-Courier" was subtitled "Moderne Tageszeitung" (Modern daily paper). In 1914 it had a circulation of 11,000, in 1923 between 50,000 and 60,000. From 1925 to 1927 the circulation was about 40,000.
On 24 December 1932 the "Börsen-Zeitung" announced that it had bought out the shares of the "Börsen-Courier". On 31 December 1933 the last issue was printed, #609. The "Börsen-Zeitung" was merged with the "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" in 1944.

Kon-Tiki (2012 film)

Kon-Tiki is a 2012 Norwegian historical drama film directed by Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg about the 1947 Kon-Tiki expedition. The film was mainly shot on the island of Malta. The role of Thor Heyerdahl is played by Pål Sverre Valheim Hagen. It was the highest-grossing film of 2012 in Norway and the country's most expensive production to date.
The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 85th Academy Awards. It is Norway's fifth Academy Award nomination. The film was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 70th Golden Globe Awards. It is the first time a Norwegian film has been nominated for both an Oscar and a Golden Globe.
Plot.
The film is the dramatised story of Thor Heyerdahl and his Kon-Tiki expedition of 1947.
While the prevailing theories of the time held that Polynesia had been settled by peoples migrating from the west, Heyerdahl, an experimental ethnographer and adventurer, sets out to prove his theory that people from South America settled the islands in pre-Columbian times.
Noting similarities between statues found in South America and the Polynesian Moai, Heyerdahl's theory about the origin of the Polynesian people is bolstered by Polynesian folklore that tells of an ancient tribe called the Hanau epe that are said to have once inhabited Easter Island. While most experts hold that such a voyage across the vast ocean is unlikely to have ever been successful, in order to illustrate that there were no technological limitations that would have inhibited the ancient peoples from making the journey, Heyerdahl puts his theory to the test and builds a balsawood raft using the same techniques that would have been utilized 1500 years ago by the indigenous peoples of the region. Though he himself cannot swim or sail, he sets out on the treacherous 4,300 nautical mile-journey across the Pacific from Peru to Polynesia aboard the small raft, along with his crew of five men (and a macaw named "Lorita").
During the three months aboard the primitive vessel named after Inca god of Sun and storm, Kon-Tiki, the crew's scientific reenactment of the legendary voyage from the coast of Peru to the Polynesian islands is met with setbacks in the form of storms, sharks, and other perils of the open sea.
Production.
Filming.
Shooting for "Kon-Tiki" took place in Norway, Malta, Bulgaria, Thailand, Sweden, and the Maldives over a period of three and a half months. Against the advice of many, the filmmakers decided to shoot the ocean scenes on the open ocean rather than on a set, insisting that the "unique challenges" they faced from shooting on the ocean actually strengthen the film.
Language.
In an unusual technique, the film was shot simultaneously in both Norwegian and English, with each scene being filmed twice, first in Norwegian and then in English. This resulted in two versions of the film to be released, one primarily for the Norwegian domestic market, the other for an international audience. In a few cases, such as action scenes and computer-generated sequences, they used the same shot, later adding English with dubbing.
Historical accuracy.
While much of the story is historically accurate, screenwriter Petter Skavlan and director Joachim Rønning both felt the need to make the story more exciting for their two-hour feature film.
Some of the alterations from Heyerdahl's book are minor: the ship's parrot is eaten by a shark in the film; its real-life counterpart was simply washed overboard by a large wave. The film shows the crew only getting access to valuable US military equipment once they have arrived in Peru and are building the raft; whereas Heyerdahl arranged for the equipment at a visit to the Pentagon before traveling to Peru.
The film has the crew worrying about getting sucked into "the Galapagos maelstrom," with a book shown that purportedly illustrates the maelstrom. The illustration is actually artist Harry Clarke's 1919 illustration for Edgar Allan Poe's short story, "A Descent Into the Maelström," a fictional account of a whirlpool in Norwegian waters. The description of its roar, which can be heard from nine miles away, is taken directly from Poe's story. Although Heyerdahl did refer to "treacherous eddies" near the Galapagos, his chief worry there was that "strong ocean currents" could sweep the raft back towards Central America. 
Most controversial has been the portrait of the raft's second-in-command, Herman Watzinger. Colleagues and relatives say Watzinger in the film is unlike the real-life Watzinger, physically or in his actions. Baasmo Christiansen, the pudgy actor who portrayed Watzinger, acknowledged the physical differences with a smile. "Watzinger was tall, dark, and Norwegian Youth Champion in the 100 meter. He was everything I'm not."
In the film, Watzinger disobeys Heyerdahl's direct order and throws a harpoon at a whale shark under the boat. It was actually Erik Hesselberg who harpooned the whale shark, with the crew cheering him on. The film's Watzinger, worried about the hemp ropes' ability to hold the balsa logs together for the entire voyage, tearfully begs Heyerdahl at sea to add steel cables Watzinger smuggled aboard. Heyerdahl's book contains no such scene. When the scene was described to Watzinger's daughter, she said it never happened. "My father was a stout and confident man, and he never thought that way about the balsa logs and the ropes." Thor Heyerdahl, Jr., who worked with Watzinger, concurred in the criticism of the film's portrayal of Watzinger.
Film critic Andrew Barker commented, "It’s frustratingly ironic that Kon-Tiki’s most outrageously fantastical sequences are completely verifiable, and its most predictable, workaday conflicts are completely made up."
The movie focuses on Heyerdahl's theory that Polynesia was first populated with humans from Peru, but it ignores the Norwegian's more ethnocentric speculations that the original Kon-Tiki voyage was undertaken by a race of tall white people with red hair and bearded men. Heyerdahl conjectured that Amer-Indian civilizations like the Aztecs and the Incas only arose with the help of advanced technical knowledge brought by early European voyagers, and that these white people were eventually driven out of Peru and fled westward on rafts.
Release.
The film premiered on 18 August 2012 at the 40th Norwegian International Film Festival in Haugesund. A North American screening took place at the Toronto International Film Festival.
The Weinstein Company acquired the distribution rights for North America, the United Kingdom and Italy in November 2012.
Box office.
"Kon-Tiki" opened in Norway on 24 August 2012, setting a weekend national box office record. It became the highest-grossing of 2012 in Norway, earning $14,111,514, and overtaking the film "", also by directors Rønning and Sandberg.
Critical response.
Kon-Tiki opened in the US on April 26, 2013, in a limited release, and was screened in 3 cinemas. On May 3, 2013, Kon-Tiki expanded to screen in 50 more cinemas. Kon-Tiki was a major box office success in its home country, Norway, and has since been gathering critical acclaim internationally.
"The Hollywood Reporter's" Sheri Linden says of "Kon-Tiki": "This retelling of a bare-bones enterprise by six men took a crew of hundreds, and the results are nothing if not polished, with handsome period detail and visual effects that are convincing, if sometimes ostentatious. The widescreen lensing (the film was shot mainly in and around Malta) doesn’t overdo the sense of wonder and, with a strong assist from the sound design, conveys the men's vulnerability to the elements."
Andrew Barker of "Variety" notes that some may take issue with the artistic license the filmmakers took in dramatizing some of the characters and events of the voyage, but describes the film overall as "a visually impeccable, professionally crafted modern vessel that lacks any of the patched-together soul of its subject."
While Michael Nordine of "LA Weekly" laments that "Kon-Tiki" "could have used a bit more [shark-attracting] blood in the water", he concedes that the "crystal-clear waves are a sight to behold nevertheless."
Rotten Tomatoes reported that 83% of the critics on that site gave "Kon-Tiki" a positive review. The site's consensus is: "A well-crafted retelling of an epic true story, Kon Tiki is a throwback to old-school adventure filmmaking that's exciting and entertaining in spite of its by-the-book plotting."
