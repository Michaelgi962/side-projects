Delta 3000

The Delta 3000 series was an American expendable launch system which was used to conduct thirty five orbital launches between 1975 and 1989. It was a member of the Delta family of rockets. Several variants existed, which were differentiated by a four digit numerical code.
The first stage was the RS-27 powered Extended Long Tank Thor, first flown on the 2000-series. Three or nine Castor-4 solid rocket boosters were attached to increase thrust at lift-off, replacing the less powerful Castor-2 boosters used on earlier models. Two second stages were available; the Delta-P, which had been flown on the Delta 1000 and 2000 series, or the Delta-K, an uprated version with the Aerojet engine. Some launches used a three-stage configuration in order to reach higher orbits. A Star-37D, Star-37E, or Star-48B PAM-D could be used as an upper stage. Launches with PAM-D upper stages were designated "Delta 3XX0 PAM-D", rather than assigning a code to the upper stage for use in the four-digit sequence. From the 4000-series onwards, the PAM-D received the upper stage code "5", however this was not applied retrospectively to 3000-series rockets, which were still in service at the time.
The Delta 3000 was launched from Space Launch Complex 2W at Vandenberg AFB and Launch Complex 17A and B at Cape Canaveral. Of the thirty five launches, two failed, and one resulted in a partial failure. The failures resulted in the loss of the Orbital Test Satellite, when an SRM malfunction caused the rocket to explode, and GOES-G due to an electrical fault which shut down the first stage engine. The partial failure was due to the premature cutoff of the first stage, which left the Dynamics Explorer spacecraft in a lower orbit than planned.

Mowahid Shah

Mowahid Hussain Shah is an attorney-at-law, author, and policy analyst. His articles are published regularly in English in both Nation (an English daily) and Nawa-i-Waqt (an Urdu daily). For over a decade, he has been the lead columnist for Pakistan Link, the most subscribed weekly throughout North America for the US Pakistani community. 
For over 30 years, Mowahid Shah has studied the interplay between religion and politics. In 1979, he was one of few authors at the time who examined the repercussions of the trial and execution of Pakistan Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, and predicted its ensuing implications, including increasing politicization of Islam in Pakistan; that "using Islamization of law to legitimize their continued power, the army may in the long term govern with a civilian façade", and that persecution of the Bhutto family would continue with consequent enlargement of the Bhutto myth. 30 years ago, he cautioned that there would be civil rights implications for the Arab-Muslim community in the US because of escalating global tensions. His prescient article in the Christian Science Monitor correctly predicted the onset of Western-Muslim world tensions well before Harvard professor Samuel P. Huntington popularized the theory of a "clash of civilizations". A few months later, he predicted that "Operation Desert Storm may become a desert trap" that "would radicalize the region for generations."
Career.
Mowahid Shah is a former law partner of U.S. Senator James Abourezk. In 1980, Senator Abourezk envisioned and founded the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC). ADC’s founding director was Dr. James Zogby. Mowahid Shah played a small role in facilitating the launch of the civil rights organization. He and Dr. Zogby wrote ADC's first publication, "The Other Anti-Semitism" and worked together in researching and analyzing similarities between 19th century anti-Jewish cartoons and modern cartoons offensive to Arabs and Muslims. 
Mowahid Shah is an original co-founder of Pakistan's second largest political party, Tehreek-e-Insaf (Justice Party), which was launched at Lahore on April 25, 1996.
From 2003-2007, Mowahid Shah served as Minister and Special Assistant to the Punjab Chief Minister, Pakistan. He played a major role in the creation of Punjab’s first comprehensive consumer protection law. He proposed a 5-point initiative aimed at ensuring that the disabled be treated with dignity, In 2004, he organized the first ever conference at the Chief Minister’s Office focused on respecting and enhancing teachers’ dignity and status.
His book, "Will & Skill", which explores West-Muslim tensions in the aftermath of 9/11 and proposes a way forward, was launched in May 2012.
Early years.
Born in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, Mowahid Shah spent part of his boyhood schooling in Jakarta, Indonesia, during the Sukarno era. A student from Forman Christian College, he went on to earn his LL.B. from Punjab University Law College. He is the son of Colonel Amjad Hussain Sayed, who is the last surviving delegate, sent by poet-philosopher Allama Iqbal, to the Muslim League session in 1937 in Lucknow, which laid the foundations of the Pakistan Movement.
As a student leader at George Washington University in the 1970s, Mowahid Shah was Editor of the "Harbinger", a student publication. He successfully defended in student court a resolution issued by the university's International Student Society in support of international human rights. In his LL.M. thesis, cited by a UN report, he posited the right under international law of the Palestinian people to resist forcible military occupation.
Mowahid Shah was one of the first Pakistani lawyers admitted to the District of Columbia and U.S. Supreme Court Bars.

Food studies

Food studies is the critical examination of food and its contexts within science, art, history, society, and other fields. It is distinctive from other food-related areas of study such as nutrition, agriculture, gastronomy, and culinary arts in that it tends to look beyond the mere consumption, production, and aesthetic appreciation of food and tries to illuminate food as it relates to a vast number of academic fields. It is thus a field that involves and attracts philosophers, historians, scientists, literary scholars, sociologists, art historians, anthropologists, and others.
State of the field.
This is an interdisciplinary and emerging field, and as such there is a substantial crossover between academic and popular work. Practitioners reference best-selling authors, such as the journalist Michael Pollan, as well as scholars, such as the historian Warren Belasco and the anthropologist Sidney Mintz. While this makes the discipline somewhat volatile, it also makes it interesting and engaging. The journalist Paul Levy has noted, for example, that "Food studies is a subject so much in its infancy that it would be foolish to try to define it or in any way circumscribe it, because the topic, discipline or method you rule out today might be tomorrow’s big thing."
Research questions.
Qualitative questions that are wrestled with include: What impact does food have on the environment? What are the ethics of eating? How does food contribute to systems of oppression? How are foods symbolic markers of identity? At the same time practitioners may ask seemingly basic questions that are nonetheless fundamental to human existence. Who chooses what we eat and why? How are foods traditionally prepared--and where is the boundary between authentic culinary heritage and invented traditions? How is food integrated into classrooms? Discussion of these questions has increased as a result of public concern about issues which have arisen as a result of the emergence of a vast array of novel food technologies throughout the last century, ranging from chemical fertilizers to GMOs. Pursuers of food studies approach these questions by first understanding the scientific, economic, and philosophical issues surrounding them.
Institutions.
One branch of this community has organized itself as The Association for the Study of Food and Society. This group hosts an annual conference (along with the Agriculture, Food, and Human Values Society); it publishes an interdisciplinary journal, "Food, Culture, and Society"; and it maintains an email listserv with over a thousand members for discussion of food-related topics. A few schools have programs in the field, including Julia Child and Jacques Pepin founded Boston University Gastronomy Masters program and New York University's program in Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health. The Department of Anthropology at Indiana University has recently started a food studies concentration within their program, leading to a PhD in Anthropology, while The New School is developing an undergraduate program in Food Studies. Prof.Fabio Parasecoli is the Coordinator of Food Studies at the New School in New York City.
Chatham University Master of Arts in Food Studies. The Masters of Arts in Food Studies emphasizes a holistic approach to food systems, from agriculture and food production to cuisines and consumption, providing intellectual and practical experience from field to table.http://www.chatham.edu/academics/programs/graduate/mafs/
Prof. Alice Julier is the Coordinator of Food Studies at Chatham University.
Even study abroad programs have created new, interdisciplinary food studies programs, among them Palazzo Rucellai in Florence and The Umbra Institute in Perugia. Gustolab Institute is another institution in Italy which offers programs in food and media, advertising, science and nutrition, new technologies, and the history of food. To be mentioned also is the Pollenzo-based (near Bra, Cuneo, Italy) Università di Scienze Gastronomiche, the Institut Européen d'Histoire et des Cultures de l'Alimentation (Tours, France - linked to the Université François Rabelais de Tours), and FOST: Social and Cultural Food Studies of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (Belgium), providing education in bachelor, master or postrgraduate studies.
Numerous presses publish academic and popular books about the cultural significance of food, some of which are Columbia University Press, University Press of Mississippi, the University of Nebraska Press, University of California Press, the University of Illinois Press, Berg, Earthscan, Routledge, Prospect, and Equinox Publishing.

<doc id="21551875" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21551875" title="Louisville Tanks">
Louisville Tanks

The Louisville Tanks were a minor league professional American football team that existed from 1935 to 1940. The team formed in the wake of the dissolution of the Louisville Bourbons of the short-lived American Football League of 1934. Organized and owned by American Standard, Inc., the team was coached by AS plant manager H.M. "Harry" Reed; its name and colors (green and gold) come from one of the products sold by American Standard. The Tanks played their home games at Parkway Field in Louisville, Kentucky, USA.
A charter member of the Midwest Football League (which evolved into the American Football League of 1938, the Tanks' first four seasons ended with league championships. In 1939, after the AFL added the Cincinnati Bengals, Los Angeles Bulldogs (both formerly of the second major American Football League), and the Columbus Bullies (an independent team), the Tanks had the only losing season in their existence (1939), finishing in last place in the newly renamed American Professional Football Association. 
The APFA announced its intention to become a major league in early 1940 and added a team from Milwaukee, but its ambitious plans crumbled in July, when Cincinnati, Columbus, and the new Milwaukee team defected to a new major American Football League. The APFA was mortally wounded as Louisville and the Dayton Bombers announced that they would not field teams for the 1940 season. The Tanks, the Bombers, and the APFA did not return to the field.
Origin, the Midwest Football League, and the American Football League.
Formed to fill the vacuum formed by the departure of the Louisville Bourbons, the Tanks wasted no time in becoming a charter member of the Midwest Football League in 1935. The Tanks shared the 1935 championship with the Cincinnati Models and the Indianapolis Indians, two teams that disappeared within the next couple of years. Louisville then dominated the league in 1936 and 1937, winning the championship title outright in both seasons.
The time between the end of the 1937 and beginning of the 1938 campaign saw much change involving the Tanks. The second major league AFL disbanded, and the freshly expanded Midwest League quickly adopted the name of the recently deceased league. While the new AFL was still asserting that it was strictly a midwestern league with no major league ambition, its footprint expanded to include Chicago and Nashville. While the Tanks finished the regular season in third place with a four-win, three-loss record (behind the Chicago Indians and the newly reformed St. Louis Gunners (four years after the latter playing in the National Football League), the Tanks won the championship in the first system of playoffs in a minor professional football league. In a Shaughnessy playoff, the Tanks beat Chicago 13-0 and St. Louis 3-0 to claim the team's fourth title in its fourth year of existence.
American Professional Football Association and demise.
The year 1939 was the fifth year of the Tanks' existence, still with their original owners and their original (head) coach, and still in the league which they helped form in their first days of their existence. The former Midwest Football League, on the other hand, changed its name for the second consecutive year (to the American Professional Football Association) as it hinted at being more than a midwestern minor league as it added the Cincinnati Bengals and Los Angeles Bulldogs of the second major AFL and a powerful independent team that would later dominate another pro football league: the Columbus Bullies. The Tanks' string of winning seasons - and league championships - ended at four as they finished in last place with a 2-9 record. The three newcomers finished in the top three positions.
The following year started with both optimism and surprise for the APFA membership. The Columbus Bullies were declared the champions with a 9-4 record despite the Los Angeles Bulldogs' losing only a single game (7 wins, 1 loss) and the Cincinnati Bengals' having a 6-2 record. Milwaukee was admitted as the replacement for the Bulldogs, who left to form the Pacific Coast Professional Football League... and the league admitted to its having major league aspirations as the Green Bay Packers protested the APFA's intrusion into its territory. 
By July, it was all over as Cincinnati, Columbus, and Milwaukee left the loop to become the charter members of a new American Football League. Louisville and the Dayton Bombers announced that they were not fielding teams for 1940... and the APFA folded. The Tanks and the Bombers never returned to the gridiron.

Cathedral of Saint Domnius

The Cathedral of Saint Domnius (), known locally as the Saint Dujam ("Sveti Dujam") or colloquially Saint Duje ("Sveti Duje"), is the Catholic cathedral in Split, Croatia. The cathedral is the seat of the Archdiocese of Split-Makarska, headed by Archbishop Marin Barišić. The Cathedral of St. Duje is a complex of a church, formed from an Imperial Roman mausoleum, with a bell tower; strictly the church is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and the bell tower to Saint Duje. Together they form the Cathedral of St. Duje.
The Cathedral of Saint Domnius, consecrated at the turn of the 7th century AD, is regarded as the oldest Catholic cathedral in the world that remains in use in its original structure, without near-complete renovation at a later date. The structure itself, built in AD 305 as the Mausoleum of Diocletian, is the second oldest structure used by any Christian Cathedral.
Name.
The cathedral was named after Saint Duje ("Saint Dujam", or "Saint Domnius") patron saint of Split, who was a 3rd-century Bishop of Salona. Salona was a large Roman city serving as capital of the Province of Dalmatia. Today it is located near the city of Solin in Croatia. Saint Duje was martyred with seven other Christians in the persecutions of the Emperor Diocletian. He was born in Antioch, in modern-day Syria, and beheaded in 304 at Salona.
Architecture.
Diocletian's Palace () is a building in the centre of Split, built for the Emperor Diocletian (a native of Dalmatia) at the turn of the 4th century. On the intersection of two main roads, cardo and decumanus, there is a monumental court Peristyle, from which the only access to Cathedral of St. Duje is to the east. 
The Cathedral of St. Duje is composed of three different sections of different ages. The main part is Emperor Diocletian's mausoleum, which dates from the end of the 3rd century. The mausoleum was built like the rest of the palace with white local limestone and marble of high quality, most of which was from marble quarries on the island of Brač, with tuff taken from the nearby river Jadro beds, and with brick made in Salonitan and other factories. 
Later, in the 17th century a chorus was added to the eastern side of the mausoleum. For that purpose the eastern wall of the mausoleum was torn down in order to unify the two chambers. 
The Bell Tower was constructed in the year 1100 AD, in the Romanesque style. Extensive rebuilding in 1908 radically changed the Bell Tower, and many of the original Romanesque sculptures were removed.
One of the best examples of Romanesque sculpture in Croatia, are the wooden doors on Cathedral of St. Duje. They were made by the medieval Croatian sculptor and painter Andrija Buvina around 1220. Two wings of the Buvina wooden door contains 14 scenes from the life of Jesus Christ, separated by rich ornaments in wood.
Treasury.
On the first floor of the sacristy is the cathedral treasury which contains relics of Saint Duje, which were brought to cathedral after his death.
Other treasures include sacral art works, like the Romanesque "The Madonna and Child" panel painting from the 13th century, objects like chalices and reliquaries by goldsmiths from the 13th to the 19th century, and mass vestments from the 14th till 19th century. It also contains famous books like the "Book of gospels" ("Splitski Evandelistar") from the 6th century, the "Supetar cartulary" ("Kartularium" from Sumpetar) from the 11th century, and the "Historia Salonitana" (The History of the people of Salona) by Toma the Archdeacon from Split in the 13th century.

Michael Sionidis

Michael Sionidis ( or Μιχάλης Σιωνίδης) was a prominent Greek leader in the Macedonian Struggle.
He was born in the village of Grciste, Ottoman Empire (nowadays in Bogdanci, Republic of Macedonia) in 1870. At the outbreak of the Macedonian Struggle in 1904, he organized a troop against the pro-Bulgarian Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization "komitadjis", acting in an area covering Grciste, Gevgelija and Doirani. In the autumn of 1904, Bulgarian "komitadjis" came to Grciste (which means "village of the Greeks") and killed many Greek inhabitants, including the teacher Chatzigeorgiou, who was a cousin of Captain Michalis, teacher Konstantinos Sionidis, his daughter, and another relative, Leonidas Sionidis. When captain Michalis returned, he organized a troop and went to the village of Mervintsa, where the "komitadjis" were hiding. In the subsequent battle, he was wounded and went to Gevgelija to recuperate (January 1905).
After the First Balkan War, Grčište came under Serbian control, and Sionidis moved to the village Matsikovo (modern Evzoni), on the then Greco-Serbian border. During the Balkan Wars, King Constantine I of Greece established his headquarters in his house. Sionidis participated in the Battle of Kilkis-Lahanas, where he was injured. Sionidis also participated in the Battle of Skra-di-Legen during World War I, and worked as a secret agent of Third Army Corps behind enemy lines, in the area of Strumica.
Following the end of World War I, Sionidis, as president of Matsikovo community, retrieved the remains of nine evzones who had been killed by the Bulgarians during the Second Balkan War, and buried them in his village. In 1927, the Renaming Committee renamed Matsikovo as Evzoni. Michael Sionidis died in 1935.
For his services, he was awarded the Golden Cross of Valour, Greece's highest bravery award, with the War Cross, and with the Commemorative Medal of the Macedonian Struggle.

Aisha

‘Ā’ishah bint Abī Bakr (b. 613/614 CE – d. 678 CE) ( transliteration: ', , also transcribed as A'ishah, Aisyah, Ayesha, A'isha, Aishat, Aishah, or Aisha) was one of Muhammad's wives. In Islamic writings, her name is thus often prefixed by the title "Mother of the Believers" (Arabic: أمّ المؤمنين "umm al-mu'minīn"), per the description of Muhammad's wives in the Quran.
Traditional Hadith sources state that Aisha was married to Muhammad at the age of six, but she stayed in her parents' home until the age of nine, when the marriage was consummated with Muhammad, then 53, in Medina; al-Tabari, born in Persia two hundred years after Muhammad's death, wrote that she was ten years old.
According to Sunni views, Aisha had an important role in early Islamic history, both during Muhammad's life and after his death. She was an active figure in numerous events and an important witness to many more. Aisha contributed to the growth, development, and understanding of Islam. Being a role model to a significant amount of others added to her attributions as a consultant regarding Muhammad's prayer and practices, soon introducing herself into a world of politics.
After Muhammad, Aisha was readily involved in continuing his message. She was present through the reigns of at least the first four caliphs. Her father, Abu Bakr, became the first caliph to succeed Muhammad. The second caliph ‘Umar succeeded Abū Bakr. During the time of the third caliph's reign Aisha rebelled. She did not fully approve of Uthman ibn Affan's practices on many occasions. During the reign of Ali, the fourth caliph she wanted to avenge Uthman's death, which she attempted to do in the Battle of the Camel. She participated in the battle by giving speeches and leading troops on the back of her camel. She ended up losing the battle, but her involvement and determination left a lasting impression.
Early life.
Aisha was born in late 613 or early 614 She was the daughter of Umm Ruman and Abu Bakr of Mecca, two of the Muhammad's most trusted companions. Aisha was the third and youngest wife of Muhammad.
Marriage to Muhammad.
The idea to match Aisha with Muhammad was suggested by Khawlah bint Hakim. After this, the previous agreement regarding the marriage of Aisha with Jubayr ibn Mut'im was put aside by common consent. Abu Bakr was uncertain at first "as to the propriety or even legality of marrying his daughter to his "brother." " British historian William Montgomery Watt suggests that Muhammad hoped to strengthen his ties with Abu Bakr; the strengthening of ties commonly served as a basis for marriage in Arabian culture.
Age at marriage.
According to scriptural Hadith sources, Aisha was six or seven years old when she was married to Muhammad and nine when the marriage was consummated.
However, some later sources disagree. al-Tabari, born in Persia two hundred years after Muhammad's death, wrote that she was ten years old. Six hundred years after the events, Ibn Khallikan recorded that she was nine years old at marriage, and twelve at consummation. Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi, born about 150 years after Muhammad's death, cited Hisham ibn Urwah as saying that she was nine years old at marriage, and twelve at consummation. but Hisham ibn Urwah's original source is otherwise unknown, and Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi's work does not have the high religious status of the Hadith.
In the twentieth cenury, Pakistani writer Muhammad Ali challenged the Hadith showing that Aisha was young as the traditional sources claim; arguing that instead a new interpretation of the Hadith compiled by Mishkat al-Masabih, Wali-ud-Din Muhammad ibn Abdullah Al-Khatib, could indicate that Aisha would have be nineteen years old around the time of her marriage.
No sources offer much more information about Aisha's childhood years. Child marriage was not uncommon in many places at the time, Arabia included. It often served political purposes, and Aisha's marriage to Muhammad would have had a political connotation.
The issue of Aisha's age at the time she was married to Muhammad has been of interest since the earliest days of Islam, and references to her age by early historians are frequent. American historian Denise Spellberg states that "these specific references to the bride's age reinforce Aisha's pre-menarcheal status and, implicitly, her virginity." Early Muslims regarded Aisha's youth as demonstrating her virginity and therefore her suitability as a bride of Muhammad. This issue of her virginity was of great importance to those who supported Aisha's position in the debate of the succession to Muhammad. These supporters considered that as Muhammad's only virgin wife, Aisha was divinely intended for him, and therefore the most credible regarding the debate.
Personal life.
Relationship with Muhammad.
In many Muslim traditions, Aisha is described as Muhammad's most beloved or favored wife after his first wife, Khadija bint Khuwaylid, who died before the migration to Medina took place. There are several hadiths, or stories or sayings of Muhammad, that support this belief. One relates that when a companion asked Muhammad, "who is the person you love most in the world?" he responded, "Aisha." Others relate that Muhammad built Aisha’s apartment so that her door opened directly into the mosque, and that she was the only woman with whom Muhammad received revelations. They bathed in the same water and he prayed while she lay stretched out in front of him.
There are also various traditions that reveal the mutual affection between Muhammad and Aisha. He would often just sit and watch her and her friends play with dolls, and on occasion he would even join them. Additionally, they were close enough that each was able to discern the mood of the other, as many stories relate. It is also important to note that there exists evidence that Muhammad did not view himself as entirely superior to Aisha, at least not enough to prevent Aisha from speaking her mind, even at the risk of angering Muhammad. On one such instance, Muhammad's "announcement of a revelation permitting him to enter into marriages disallowed to other men drew from her the retort, 'It seems to me your Lord hastens to satisfy your desire!'" Furthermore, Muhammad and Aisha had a strong intellectual relationship. Muhammad valued her keen memory and intelligence and so instructed his companions to draw some of their religious practices from her.
Accusation of adultery.
The story of accusation of adultery levied against Aisha can be traced to "sura" (chapter) "An-Nur" of the Quran. As the story goes, Aisha left her "howdah" in order to search for a missing necklace. Her slaves mounted the "howdah" and prepared it for travel without noticing any difference in weight without Aisha's presence. Hence the caravan accidentally departed without her. She remained at the camp until the next morning, when Safwan bin al-Mu‘attal, a nomad and member of Muhammad's army, found her and brought her back to Muhammad at the army's next camp. Rumours that Aisha and Safwan had committed adultery were spread, particularly by Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy, Hassan ibn Thabit, Mistah ibn Uthatha and Hammanah bint Jahsh (sister of Zaynab bint Jahsh, another of Muhammad's wives). Usama ibn Zayd, son of Zayd ibn Harithah, defended Aisha's reputation, but Ali recommended that he divorce her. Muhammad came to speak directly with Aisha about the rumours. He was still sitting in her house when he announced that he had received a revelation from God confirming Aisha's innocence. Surah 24 details the Islamic laws and punishment regarding adultery and slander. Aisha's accusers were subjected to punishments of 80 lashes.
Story of the honey.
After the daily "Asr" prayer, Muhammad would visit each of his wives' apartments to inquire about their well-being. Muhammad was just in the amount of time he spent with them and attention he gave to them. Once, Muhammad's fifth wife, Zaynab bint Jahsh, received some honey from a relative which Muhammad took a particular liking to. As a result, every time Zaynab offered some of this honey to him he would spend a longer time in her apartment. This did not sit well with Aisha and Hafsa bint Umar.
Soon after this event, Muhammad reported that he had received a revelation in which he was told that he could eat anything permitted by God. Some Sunni commentators on the Quran sometimes give this story as the "occasion of revelation" for At-Tahrim, which opens with the following verses: Word spread to the small Muslim community that Muhammad's wives were speaking sharply to him and conspiring against him. Muhammad, saddened and upset, separated from his wives for a month. ‘Umar, Hafsa's father, scolded his daughter and also spoke to Muhammad of the matter. By the end of this time, his wives were humbled; they agreed to "speak correct and courteous words" and to focus on the afterlife.
Death of Muhammad.
Aisha remained Muhammad's favorite wife throughout his life. When he became ill and suspected that he was probably going to die, he began to ask his wives whose apartment he was to stay in next. They eventually figured out that he was trying to determine when he was due with Aisha, and they then allowed him to retire there. He remained in Aisha's apartment until his death, and his last breath was taken as he lay in the arms of Aisha, his most beloved wife.
Political career.
After Muhammad's death, which ended Aisha and Muhammad's 9 year-long marriage, Aisha lived fifty more years in and around Medina. Much of her time was spent learning and acquiring knowledge of the Quran and the "sunnah" of Muhammad. Aisha was one of three wives (the other two being Hafsa bint Umar and Umm Salama) who memorized the Quran. Like Hafsa, Aisha had her own script of the Quran written after Muhammad's death. During Aisha's life many prominent customs of Islam, such as veiling and seclusion of women, began.
Aisha's importance to revitalizing the Arab tradition and leadership among the Arab women highlights her magnitude within Islam. Aisha became involved in the politics of early Islam and the first three caliphate reigns: Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, and ‘Uthman. During a time in Islam when women were not expected, or wanted, to contribute outside of the household, Aisha delivered public speeches, became directly involved in war and even battles, and helped both men and women to understand the practices of Muhammad.
Role during caliphate.
Role during first and second caliphates.
After Muhammad's death in 632, Abu Bakr was appointed as the first caliph. This matter of succession to Muhammad is extremely controversial to the Shia who believe that Ali had been appointed by Muhammad to lead while Sunni maintain that the public elected Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr had two advantages in achieving his new role: his long personal friendship with Muhammad and his role as father-in-law. As caliph, Abu Bakr was the first to set guidelines for the new position of authority.
Aisha garnered more special privilege in the Islamic community for being known as both a wife of Muhammad and the daughter of the first caliph. Being the daughter of Abu Bakr tied Aisha to honorable titles earned from her father's strong dedication to Islam. For example, she was given the title of "al-siddiqa bint al-siddiq", meaning 'the truthful woman, daughter of the truthful man', a reference to Abu Bakr's support of the Isra and Mi'raj.
In 634 Abu Bakr fell sick and was unable to recover. Prior to his death, he appointed ‘Umar, one of his chief advisers, as the second caliph Throughout ‘Umar's time in power Aisha continued to play the role of a consultant in political matters.
Role during the third caliphate.
After ‘Umar died, ‘Uthmān was chosen to be the third caliph. He wanted to promote the interests of the Umayyads. Aisha had little involvement with ‘Uthmān for the first couple years, but eventually she found a way into the politics of his reign. She eventually grew to despise ‘Uthmān, and many are unsure of what specifically triggered her eventual opposition towards him. A prominent opposition that arose towards him was when ‘Uthmān mistreated ‘Ammar ibn Yasir (companion of Muhammad) by beating him. Aisha became enraged and spoke out publicly, saying, "How soon indeed you have forgotten the practice (sunnah) of your prophet and these, his hairs, a shirt, and sandal have not yet perished!".
As time continued issues of antipathy towards ‘Uthmān continued to arise. Another instance of opposition arose when the people came to Aisha, after Uthmān ignored the rightful punishment for Walid idn Uqbah (Uthmān's brother). Aisha and Uthmān argued with each other, Uthmān eventually made a comment on why Aisha had come and how she was "ordered to stay at home". Arising from this comment, was the question of whether Aisha, and for that matter women, still had the ability to be involved in public affairs. The Muslim community became split: "some sided with Uthmān, but others demanded to know who indeed had better right than Aisha in such matters".
The caliphate took a turn for the worse when Egypt was governed by Abdullah ibn Saad. Abbott reports that Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhayfa of Egypt, an opponent of ‘Uthmān, forged letters in the Mothers of the Believers' names to the conspirators against ‘Uthmān. The people cut off ‘Uthmān's water and food supply. When Aisha realized the behavior of the crowd, Abbott notes, Aisha could not believe the crowd "would offer such indignities to a widow of Mohammad". This refers to when Safiyya bint Huyayy (one of Muhammad's wives) tried to help ‘Uthmān and was taken by the crowd. Malik al-Ashtar then approached her about killing Uthmān and the letter, and she claimed she would never want to "command the shedding of the blood of the Muslims and the killing of their Imām"; she also claimed she did not write the letters. The city continued to oppose ‘Uthmān, but as for Aisha, her journey to Mecca was approaching. With the journey to Mecca approaching at this time, she wanted to rid herself of the situation. ‘Uthmān heard of her not wanting to hurt him, and he asked her to stay because of her influence on the people, but this did not persuade Aisha, and she continued on her journey.
First Fitna.
[[File:First Fitna map.png|thumb|350px|Domains of Rashidun Caliphate under four caliphs. The divided phase relates to the Rashidun Caliphate of Ali during the First Fitna.
]]
Abu Bakr's reign was short, and in 634 he was succeeded by Umar, as caliph. Umar reigned for ten years, and was then followed by Uthman ibn Affan in 644. Both of these men had been among Muhammad's earliest followers, were linked to him by clanship and marriage, and had taken prominent parts in various military campaigns. Aisha, in the meantime, lived in Medina and made several pilgrimages to Mecca.
in 655, Uthman was murdered provoking the First Fitna. The rebels then asked Ali to be the new caliph. Many reports absolve Ali of complicity in the murder. Ali is reported to have refused the caliphate. He agreed to rule only after his followers persisted.
When Ali could not execute those merely accused of Uthman's murder, Aisha delivered a fiery speech and the first to respond to Aisha was Abdullah ibn Aamar al-Hadhrami, the governor of Mecca during the reign of Uthman, and prominent members of the Banu Umayya. With the funds from the "Yemeni Treasury" Aisha set out on a campaign against the Rashidun Caliphate of Ali.
Aisha alongside an army with Zubayr ibn al-Awam and Talha ibn Ubayd-Allah confronted Ali's army demanding the prosecution of Uthman's killers which they were mingled in his army outside the city of Basra. When her forces captured Basra she ordered the execution of 600 Muslims and 40 others were executed in the Grand Mosque of Basra among them was Hakim ibn Jabala. Aisha's forces are also known to have tortured and imprisoned Othman ibn Hanif the governor of Basra appointed by Ali.
Professor Leila Ahmed claims that it was during this engagement that Muslims fought Muslims for the first time. Battle ensued and Aisha's forces were defeated. Aisha was directing her forces from a howdah on the back of a camel; this 656 battle is therefore called the Battle of the Camel during which 10,000 Muslims were killed.
After 110 days of conflict the Rashidun Caliph Ali ibn Abi Talib met Aisha with reconciliation. He sent her back to Medina under military escort headed by her brother Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, one of Ali's commanders. She subsequently retired to Medina with no more interference with the affairs of state she was also awarded a pension by Ali.
Although she retired to Medina her forsaken efforts against the Rashidun Caliphate of Ali did not end the First Fitna.
Contributions to Islam and influence.
After 25 years of a monogamous relationship with his first wife, Khadija bint Khuwaylid, Muhammad participated in nine years of polygyny, marrying at least nine further wives. Muhammad's subsequent marriages were depicted purely as political matches rather than unions of sexual indulgence. In particular, Muhammad's unions with Aisha and Hafsa bint Umar associated him with two of the most significant leaders of the early Muslim community, Aisha's and Hafsa's fathers, Abu Bakr and ‘Umar ibn al-Khattāb, respectively.
Aisha's marriage has given her significance among many within Islamic culture, becoming known as the most learned woman of her time. Being Muhammad's favorite wife, Aisha occupied an important position in his life. When Muhammad married Aisha in her youth, she was accessible "...to the values needed to lead and influence the sisterhood of Muslim women." After the death of Muhammad, Aisha was discovered to be a renowned source of hadiths, due to her qualities of intelligence and memory. Aisha conveyed ideas expressing Muhammad's practice (sunnah). She expressed herself as a role model to women, which can also be seen within some traditions attributed to her. The traditions regarding Aisha habitually opposed ideas unfavorable to women in efforts to elicit social change.
Muhammad became a significantly powerful figure of the rapidly expanding Islamic community in 627 Due to this expansion, segregation of his wives was permitted to enforce their sacrosanct status.
According to Reza Aslan:
Aisha played a key role in the emergence of Islam, and played an active position in social reform of the Islamic culture. Not only was she supportive of Muhammad, but she contributed scholarly intellect to the development of Islam. She was given the title "al-Siddiqah", meaning 'the one who affirms the truth'. Aisha was known for her "...expertise in the Quran, shares of inheritance, lawful and unlawful matters, poetry, Arabic literature, Arab history, genealogy, and general medicine." Her intellectual contributions regarding the verbal texts of Islam were in time transcribed into written form, becoming the official history of Islam. After the death of Muhammad, Aisha was regarded as the most reliable source in the teachings of hadith. As she was Muhammad's favorite wife and a close companion, soon after his death the Islamic community began consulting Aisha on Muhammad's practices, and she was often used to settle disputes on demeanor and various points of law. Aisha's authentication of Muhammad's ways of prayer and his recitation of the Quran allowed for development of knowledge of his sunnah of praying and reading verses of the Quran.
During Aisha's entire life she was a strong advocate for the education of Islamic women, especially in law and the teachings of Islam. She was known for establishing the first "madrasa" for women in her home. Attending Aisha's classes were various family relatives and orphaned children. Men also attended Aisha's classes, with a simple curtain separating the male and female students.
Political influence.
As mentioned before, Aisha became an influential figure in early Islam after Muhammad's death. However, Aisha also had a strong political influence. Though Muhammad had ordered his wives to stay in the home, Aisha, after Muhammad's death, took a public and predominant role in politics. Some say that Aisha's political influence helped promote her father, Abu Bakr, to the caliphate after Muhammad's death.
After the defeat at the Battle of the Camel, Aisha retreated to Medina and became a teacher. Upon her arrival in Medina, Aisha retired from her public role in politics. Her discontinuation of public politics, however, did not stop her political influence completely. Privately, Aisha continued influencing those intertwined in the Islamic political sphere. Amongst the Islamic community, she was known as an intelligent woman who debated law with male companions. Aisha was also considered to be the embodiment of proper rituals while partaking in the pilgrimage to Mecca, a journey she made with several groups of women. For the last two years of her life, Aisha spent much of her time telling the stories of Muhammad, hoping to correct false passages that had become influential in formulating Islamic law. Due to this, Aisha's political influence continues to impact those in Islam.
Death.
Aisha died of disease at her home in Medina on 17 Ramadan 58 AH (16 July 678). She was 64 years old. Muhammad's companion Abu Hurairah led her funeral prayer after the "tahajjud" (night) prayer, and she was buried at Jannat al-Baqi‘.
Views.
Sunni view of Aisha.
Sunnis believe she was Muhammad's favorite wife. They consider her (among other wives) to be "Umm al-Mu’minin" and among the members of the Ahl al-Bayt, or Muhammad's family.
Shia view of Aisha.
The Shia view Aisha negatively. They accuse her of defying Ali ibn Abi-Taleb during his caliphate in the Battle of the Camel, when she fought men from Ali's army in Basra. Aisha has a misconception that he is the killer of Uthman.

Jeddore, Nova Scotia

Jeddore is a Canadian community in Nova Scotia's Halifax Regional Municipality. The community itself comprises several smaller communities. Often the inner communities are referred to on their own but much of the time simply the encapsulating region of Jeddore is simply used. This is most likely due to the size of the communities, individually they are relatively unknown to residents outside of Nova Scotia's Eastern Shore.
Jeddore is located on the Eastern Shore along Trunk 7, also known as the "Marine Drive".
Communities.
The area of Jeddore comprises the following four communities:
History.
Jeddore was originally known as "River of Theodore". It was given this name by the French explorer, Nicholas Denys who visited the area in 1672. The name eventually became known as Jeddore.
Battle at Winnepang (Jeddore Harbour).
During the Mi’kmaq and Maliseet War, in July 1722 the Abenaki made an effort to create a blockade of the capital of Nova Scotia Annapolis Royal. They captured 18 fishing vessels along with prisoners between present-day Yarmouth and Canso. They also captured vessels and took prisoners from the Bay of Fundy. 
Governor Richard Philipps commissioned Capt. John Eliot and Capt. John Robinson in two sloops with regiments to protect the fishery at Canso, Nova Scotia and retrieve the captured vessels and prisoners. Toward this end, Capt. Eliot made a surprise attack on forty Natives on a ship at present-day Jeddore Harbour. The natives were among six of the fishing vessels they had seized. There was a 30 minute battle. Capt. Eliot was badly wounded as were several of his men. One was killed. Then Capt. Eliot lobbed a hand granadoes (type of hand grenade) into the native vessel. Some natives were killed in the explosion. Others tried to swim ashore as they were being shot by the New Englanders. Thirty-five Natives were killed. The New Englanders managed to rescue fifteen prisoners from the vessels, while discovering that nine had been killed. 
Captain Robinson captured two of the vessels and killed numerous Maine natives . He then arrived at present-day Lunenburg, Nova Scotia where the natives held five of the fishing vessels along with twenty prisoners. Robinson paid a ransom and they were released.
Attack at Jeddore.
During Father Le Loutre's War, on the night of April 21, under the leadership of Chief Jean-Baptiste Cope and the Mi'kmaq attacked another British schooner in a battle at sea off Jeddore, Nova Scotia. On board were nine British men and one Acadian (Casteel), who was the pilot. The Mi'kmaq killed and scalped the British and let the Acadian off at Port Toulouse, where the Mi'kmaq sank the schooner after looting it.
Geography.
The area of Jeddore surrounds a deep natural harbour and while inland, it is dotted by various lakes and drumlins.
Jeddore Harbour.
Jeddore Harbour lies in the center of the communities of Jeddore with East, West and Head Jeddore lying in their respective directions from the sea. Jeddore Oyster Ponds Lies to the northwest and Myers Point peninsula juts out at the head. The inlet is 11 km (7 mi) long and 5 km (3 mi) wide.
The harbour is fed by Salmon River from the north. Salmon River which is actually and semi-saltwater fjord, which is spring fed but becomes increasingly contaminated by the sea water as it deepens and opens to the bay (eastern arm of the harbour).
Economy.
The fishing industry remains the most important part of the economy in the area. Seafood processing factors highly into the economy with lobster making up the greatest proportion of fish exported directly from the area itself.
The are is home to at least five seafood processing plants:

Marc Amsler

Marc Amsler (born February 5, 1891 in Vevey, Switzerland; died May 3, 1968) was a professor of ophthalmology at der Zurich Eye Clinic at the University of Zurich.
He took the position as professor of ophthalmology in Zurich in 1944. His predecessor was Prof. Alfred Vogt. Prior to assuming the position at Zurich, Dr. Amsler was chief ophthalmologist in Lausanne, since 1935. His predecessor there, under whom he worked beforehand, was Jules Gonin. He is best known for the Amsler grid test. He also contributed to the progress in understanding of uveitis. The Amsler grid was an improvement over the initial work done by the ophthalmologist Edmond Landolt. The grid tests the function of the macula, a part of the retina, so that macular degeneration can be identified. Amsler also published works on keratoconus. In 1951, Dr. Amsler performed the first corneal transplantation at the Zurich Eye clinic. He was professor and chief of the Zurich Eye Clinic until 1961. His successor was Rudolf Witmer.

Church of the Holy Mother of God (Aleppo)

Church of the Holy Mother of God (also Surp Asdvadzadzin, Surp Asdvatsatsin, Surp Asdvatsatsna, Virgin Mary church) is an Armenian Apostolic church in Suleimaniyeh area of Aleppo, Syria, near the Quweiq river. The construction of the church is active since its consecration which took place on 1 May 1983, by Karekin II, Catholicos of the Armenian Catholicosate of Cilicia. 
Background.
The current church of the Holy Mother of God is considered the continuation of the historic church of the Holy Mother of God of the old Christian Jdeydeh quarter, which was opened in 1429 and operated until the beginnings of the 20th century, within the courtyard of the Forty Martyrs Cathedral of Aleppo, when it was turned into a library and recently to the Zarehian Museum in 1991.
History.
The absence of a church to serve the large Armenian community of the Suleimaniyeh area of Aleppo, arose the idea of building a new church, which became true with the donations of Armenian benefactors -especially those whose roots were from the Cilician city of "Aintab" (nowadays Gaziantep)- and throughout the efforts of father Zarmayr Hindoyan, the spiritual leader of Aintabian Armenians in Aleppo. 
The ground-blessing ceremony took place on 10 September 1972 with the presence of Khoren I, Catholicos of the Holy See of Cilicia, during the period of Bishop Datev Sarkissian. The construction work was finished completely in 1982. The consecration ceremony took place on 1 May 1983 under the patronage of Karekin II.
Nowadays, the church itself plays a big role in the life of the Armenians of Aleppo. It is usually crowded with the faithful during regular Sunday masses. Many Armenians are members of the church.
The church has a large hall opened in 1987 with a stage downstairs, used for cultural meetings, concerts, seminars and celebrations.
In 1993 a Khachkar-memorial by Sarkis Balmanougian was erected in the right side of the main entrance of the church, to commemorate the victims of the Armenian Genocide. The church was completely renovated in 1998.
Adjacent to the church is the Armenian Gertasirats High School and the "Zohrab Kaprielian Theatre".

The Perfect Mile: Three Athletes, One Goal, and Less Than Four Minutes to Achieve It (2004) by Neal Bascomb is a non-fiction book about three runners and their attempts to become the first man to run a mile under four minutes. The runners are Englishman Roger Bannister, American Wes Santee, and Australian John Landy. The book's climax is Bannister's breaking of the record on May 6, 1954.
"The New York Times"' review calls it an "enthralling book" and says Bascomb "expertly winds up the tension of the three men's many failed attempts to get closer to the magic mark, before Bannister wrote himself into legend first on a windy day at the Oxford University track".

Kopay Electoral District was an electoral district of Sri Lanka between August 1947 and February 1989. The district was named after the town of Kopay in Jaffna District, Northern Province. The 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka introduced the proportional representation electoral system for electing members of Parliament. The existing 160 mainly single-member electoral districts were replaced with 22 multi-member electoral districts. Kopay electoral district was replaced by the Jaffna multi-member electoral district at the 1989 general elections, the first under the PR system, though Kopay continues to be a polling division of the multi-member electoral district.

Petromidia Refinery

History.
The refinery was founded in 1975 as the "Midia Năvodari Petrochemical Factory" on a plot of land located in Năvodari, Constanţa County. The design and construction of the complex took two years and was based on Romanian technology and foreign licenses. In 1991 the Midia Năvodari Petrochemical Factory is transformed into a joint stock company and the name is changed to SC Petromidia SA.
Between 1997 and 2000 the state tried to privatise the company several times. The first procedure was undertaken in 1997 and negotiations were held with a consortium made by South Korean Daewoo and Swiss company Glencore and with a company named Petromidia USA (local representative of the Windmill company). Between July 1998 and January 1999 a new round of negotiations were finalised and the Turkish company Akmaya was chosen as a strategic investor, offering a per share price of US$ 10.1. On November 1, 2000, the Romanian Property Fund () sold a stake of 69,991% of the complex to Rompetrol Group BV Rotterdam at a price of US$ 50.517 million equivalent to US$ 2 per share. The value of the transaction was US$ 615 million, of which US$ 225 million for modernisation works and other investments and US$ 340 million (US$ 169 million for debts to the state and US$ 171 million to banks and other creditors) for various debts. Rompetrol also changed the name of the refinery to "Rompetrol Rafinare". In April 2004 Rompetrol Rafinare was listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange under the symbol RRC. Soon after it became one of the most important listed companies and in December 2004 it was included in the BET 10 index. 
In 2003 the refinery was named "Refinery of the Year in Central and Eastern Europe" by the World Refining Association.
Refining capacity.
Petromidia is the only Romanian refinery located at the Black Sea shore, thus having the advantage of being supplied directly through the Midia oil terminal located in the Port of Midia capable of receiving oil tankers up to or the pipeline starting in the Port of Constanţa. The refinery has an annual processing capacity of 4.8 million tonnes/year or and storage facilities for up to 400,000 m3 of oil.

Norah Al Faiz

Norah bint Abdallah Al Faiz (), also spelled Noura Al Fayez, (born 1956) is the first woman to hold a cabinet-level office in Saudi Arabia.
Early life and education.
Norah Al Faiz was born in Shaqraa in 1956. Al Faiz received a bachelor of arts degree in sociology from King Saud University in Riyadh in 1979. She also received a master's degree in Instructional Technologies from Utah State University in 1982.
Career.
Upon returning to Saudi Arabia, Al Faiz worked as a teacher. She became head principal of the girls' section at Prince Alwaleed bin Talal’s Kingdom Schools.
Later, Al Faiz served as the head of ministry of education’s educational technology center, and a lecturer and head of the training board of the ministry’s administration institute from 1983 to 1988. In 1993, she became ministry's educational supervisor for girls’ private education. She was also appointed the director general of women's section of the institute of public administration in 1993, which she held until 2009. In addition, she worked as an associate professor in the department of education techniques from 1989 to 1995 at the College of Education, King Saud University.
Al Faiz was named deputy minister of education in charge of women’s affairs in February 2009 and is the first woman to direct girls’ education in Saudi Arabia. She told that her appointment is "a source of pride for all women."
Reactions to her appointment.
Saudi journalist Khalid Almeena stated "People are very excited about this appointment." Prince Talal considered her appointment as part of a larger process of change, initiated by King Abdullah even before his coronation, when he was still crown prince. He further stated that this appointment was good news for men even more than women, and was a call for women to take their natural place in society.
Faisal bin Abdallah, education minister, also welcomed her appointment as a deputy. He told that the Saudi education ministry was proud to be the first to have a woman in a ministry post, and that women help men in numerous areas, including in education.
However, Ali Alyami argued that her appointment was largely a move to make democratic reformers ineffective in and outside the country with the goal of reducing global criticism over the Saudi segregationist policies and oppression of women. For him, this move strengthens and reinforces King Abdullah’s position in the country. Shortly, he thought that her appointment led to a short-lived positive impact on the psyche and ethos of Saudi society, but it did not last for a long-time.
Views.
Her "Al Watan" interview seems to support Ali Alyami's views. Four months after her appointment, in June 2009, Norah Al Faiz told that "the time was still too soon for topic ”of sports for girls." Since her photo was published in the same daily, showing his face without niqab, she angrily reacted and said "The publication of my photo upset me immensely...[It is well known that I am a Saudi woman from Najd, and thus I wear a niqab. I will never allow the publishing of my photo in newspapers and I will not accept that it be put up anywhere."
Personal life.
Al Faiz is married and has three sons and two daughters. In April 2012, Utah State University granted her an honorary degree.
In 2009, she was regarded as one of the 500 influential Muslims by Georgetown University's center for Muslim-Christian understanding.

Kaba Aye Pagoda

Kaba Aye Pagoda (; ; also spelt Gaba Aye Pagoda; lit. World Peace Pagoda), formally Thiri Mingala Gaba Aye Zedidaw, ), is a pagoda located on Kaba Aye Road, Mayangon Township, Yangon, Myanmar. The pagoda was built in 1952 by U Nu in preparation for the Sixth Buddhist Council that he held from 1954-1956. The pagoda measures high and is also around the base. The pagoda is located approximately 11 km north of Yangon, a little past the Inya Lake Hotel. The Maha Pasana Guha (great cave) was built simultaneously with the Kaba Aye Pagoda and is located in the same complex. The cave is a replica of the Satta Panni cave, located in India, where the first Buddhist Synod was convened. The six entrances of The Maha Pasana Cave symbolize the Sixth Great Synod. The cave is long and wide. Inside, the assembly hall is long and wide.
Background.
As prime minister of Burma, U Nu built the Kaba Aye Pagoda and the Maha Pasana Guha Cave () in 1952 in preparation for the Sixth Buddhist Synod that he convened and hosted and which lasted two years, from 1954–1956. This Synod coincided with the 2500-year anniversary of Buddha’s enlightenment. In Burma, the kings traditionally built a pagoda in their honor to stand as a relic of their rule. For example, Ne Win built the Maha Wizaya Pagoda in his honor. The construction of the pagoda and cave were a part of U Nu’s attempt to establish Buddhism as the official religion of Burma, thereby creating a Buddhist state.
The Kaba Aye pagoda is open daily from 6 am to 8 pm, with an admission fee of $5. In addition to the Burmese who make religious pilgrimages, the pagoda attracts domestic as well as foreign tourists. The Kaba Aye Pagoda compound is large and is intended to be peaceful and quiet for the tourists, monks and devotees who visit.
The circular platform surrounding the main pagoda is enclosed in the style of a cave-temple. There are five porches decorated with colorful arched pediments. Lotus flowers, lotus buds and swastikas are carved in stucco around the outside. The main pagoda is 117 feet 6 inches high, with smaller pagodas on the five porches each high. Vendors sell handmade products on the entrances to the pagoda. The pagoda, which is hollow, has a middle point inside which features four great Buddhas (four great pillars) in commemoration of the four Buddhas who have already appeared in the world. A room inside the pagoda houses Buddha relics, including a large silver statue of Buddha, over eight feet tall. There is also a room inside the pagoda, which is used to keep Buddha relics.
The Maha Pasana Cave, which translates to “great cave of stone,” is located to the north of the Kaba Aye pagoda. The cave is a replica to the cave by the same name in India, where the first Buddhist Synod or Great Council was held just some months after the Buddha underwent Parinirvana. During the sixth Buddhist Synod in 1954, 2500 monks converged on the cave to recite the words of the Buddha in Pali, the entire Tipitaka. The monks recited, edited, and approved all of the Buddhist scriptures, known as the Three Pitakat.
Political significance.
U Nu was the first Prime Minister of Burma after the 1947 Constitution of the Union of Burma was passed. U Nu was a devout Buddhist and he tried to establish Burma as a Buddhist country. On August 29, 1961, the Parliament announced that Buddhism was the official state religion, mainly as a result of U Nu’s efforts. Cow slaughtering was officially banned in Burma. However, in 1962 Ne Win, who succeeded U Nu, repealed this measure and the effort to make Burma a Buddhist country was effectively halted. The construction of the Kaba Aye complex was part of U Nu’s attempt to institutionalize Buddhism at the national level. 
The Kaba Aye complex also underscores the failure of U Nu to standardize and institutionalize Buddhism. There are numerous minorities in Burma such as the Kachins and Karens who felt alienated by this effort to make Buddhism a state enterprise. Furthermore, Buddhists did not believe that Buddhism should be a part of a political institution. They wanted Burma to be a moral society but did not wish their religion to be imposed on the citizens. The monks who want religion to be a social practice that is separate from the state do not associate with these pagodas. Therefore, the pagodas such as the Kaba Aye are not affiliated with any monasteries. The fear is that if these monks become tied to a pagoda, which was built by the state and is run by the state, they will be captured by the state and lose their autonomy.
Significance and Origin of Pagodas in Burma.
The most sacred pagoda in Burma is the Shwedagon Pagoda (Golden Pagoda). This pagoda towers at tall, is gilded in gold and is also located in Yangon. It, too, contains relics of the past four Buddhas inside of it. According to legend, the pagoda is 2500 years old. Burma is most famous to the western world because of the Shwedagon Pagoda. For the Burmese people, seeing foreign tourists visit the pagoda and looking at it in awe is a source of national pride. 
In the 11th century, King Anawrahta invaded the Mon Kingdom of Thaton in what is currently part of southern Burma. Following the successful invasion he returned to Pagan with the missionary monk Shin Arahan and the Buddhist scriptures he had brought with him from Ceylon. After establishing his Pagan dynasty through constant warfare, Anawrahta established Theravada Buddhism as the state religion in 1056 and built many pagodas. Some feel as though he built these pagodas in order to make up for the violent warfare by which he built his Pagan dynasty. Anawrahta implemented a tradition of pagoda building that has continued until the present. It was in keeping with this tradition that Ne Win began building his Maha Wizaya Pagoda. Furthermore, the military regime that succeeded him built the Swedawmyat (tooth relic) Pagoda. Currently, hundreds of pagodas dot the Burmese landscape. Scholars suggest that besides King Anawrahta, many other leaders built the pagodas not out of devotion to Buddhism, but rather to assuage the guilt that they felt for carrying out multiple invasions of other kingdoms in India and Thailand, in addition to other parts of what is currently Burma.
1996 Bombings.
On December 25, 1996, two bombs exploded at the Kaba Aye Pagoda and Maha Pasana Cave, killing five people and wounding 17. The initial explosion took place at the Kaba Aye Pagoda at 8:20 pm, but nobody was injured because pilgrims did not use that entrance. However, the second explosion, which detonated two hours later as authorities were looking into the other blast, went off inside the temple as it was filling with pilgrims, causing the fatalities and injuries. At the Kaba Aye compound Buddha's tooth relic was on display, and thus many more pilgrims were at the site than during normal times. The tooth relic, on loan from China and believed to be one of two surviving since the Buddha's death 2500 years ago, was not damaged in the bombing.
The explosion followed a crackdown on student protestors who were demanding more civil liberties. The SLORC (State Law and Order Restoration Council) accused the All-Burma Students Democratic Front (ABSDF) and the KNU (Karen National Union) of carrying out the bombing. Both groups denied the accusation. Aung Naing U, the foreign affairs liaison officer of the ABSDA, denied all involvement and added, “This is just an excuse by the SLORC to use force in suppressing the democratic forces. We learned that more security forces were placed at the site of the bombing; despite this measure, the explosions took place. Thus, it is assumed that it must be the work of the SLORC.”
Even before the bombing at the Kaba Aye complex, the Burmese government had been accused of staging disturbances to justify crackdowns that would follow. Namely, the government freed prison inmates in 1988 who then turned pro-democracy protests into riots that were stopped with bloodshed.

Mass-market theory

The mass-market theory is a marketing theory that applies to fashion. It states that fashions spread across different peer-reference groups, each with its own fashion leaders. In contrast to the trickle-down effect of fashion innovation, this theory states that fashion trickles across different social groups as opposed to upper to lower classes. Fashion innovation does not have to come from the upper class but can actually come from the lower-class.It is also, thus, known as the trickle-across theory.

Mr. Motivation

"Mr. Motivation" is the nineteenth episode of the science fiction television series 2002 revival of "The Twilight Zone". The episode was first broadcast on November 20, 2002, on UPN.
Plot.
Charlie is afraid to stick up for himself, so his boss, Rick, gives him a doll called Mr. Motivation to boost his self-confidence. Mr. Motivation appears to be a cheesy toy with cheesy phrases, until it says a phrase, out loud, that helps Charlie ask his co-worker Linda out on a date. Rick then gives Charlie a nearly impossible task: find a shipping manifest on a birth control pill, Ovatril, so that Rick can change dates to avoid any legal liability to the company, but more importantly cover himself; due to the fact he committed fraud. Charlie tells Rick that it would be wrong, but he still wants to go through with it. Later, Charlie's boss comes to get the document from Charlie's cubicle. However, the toy stands up to his boss for him by putting a wire out from under Charlie's desk so that Rick will trip.
Charlie, who is fed up of hearing Mr. Motivation talk, throws him down a garbage chute. Somehow, Mr. Motivation wound up in Rick's office with a piece of paper on him, taunting Rick. Thinking Charlie did this to blackmail him, Rick forces Charlie to cancel his date with Linda, by making him work on an even more impossible task. She tells Charlie that he needs to stand up to him. Charlie reacts by finding a document that would prove that Rick had committed fraud. However, Rick catches him and chases him. Rick takes the folder from Charlie and beats him to the ground in front of his coworkers. However, Charlie still has the document and Rick only got the folder from him. Rick goes back after Charlie but he trips on a wire that the doll put down again.
Charlie comes in as the new boss a few days later. He bumps into an employee named Carl in the hallway. Ironically, he threatens him by saying that if Carl cannot do his job right, Charlie will find someone who will.
When Charlie goes back to his office, Mr. Motivation rebukes him for talking that way to Carl. Chastened, Charlie calls Carl and praises him for doing a good job.

LeDoux/Healey House

The LeDoux/Healey House is located on Deer Hill Road in Cornwall on Hudson, New York, United States. It was built around 1890 for a daughter of Lyman Abbott who was a summer resident of the area. It is considered a good example of the Shingle style and was renovated and expanded by later owners. In 1982 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The house is situated near the top of Deer Hill, a wooded area that is the highest point in the village. There are views to the Hudson River. It is a two-story hip-roofed shingle-sided frame building with polygonal and gabled dormer windows on its upper story. The west facade has a full-length stone veranda with shingled pillars, leading to an enclosed porch on the southern end. On the east, a small hipped roof overhangs an original Dutch door. Many original finishings and trim remain inside as well.
It was built around 1890 by the local firm of Mead and Taft as a summer residence during a time when Cornwall was becoming popular with New York City residents as a place to escape the heat in the summer. The architect is unknown. Its second owner greatly expanded it into its present form. Afterwards it became part of an estate. The carriage house renovated and expanded into a separate residence in 1972. It has remained a private house throughout its existence.

Václav Hudeček (born June 7, 1952 in Rožmitál pod Třemšínem) is a Czech violinist.
He studied at the Prague Conservatory. While he was still only fifteen, he performed in concert on 11 November 1967 with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London. One day later he was heard by the legendary David Oistrach. Hudeček was the pupil of this great master from 1970 to Oistrach's death in 1974. His wife is actress Eva Hudečková.
Václav Hudeček has started his exemplarily steep journey to the Czech and international interpretative elite in the sixties. Being already fifteen, he appeared at a concert in London with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra on 11 November 1967. One day later, the legendary David Oistrach heard him and foretold him a great future and offered him his pedagogical help. Since 1970 until Oistrach's death in 1974, he was a pupil of this great Master.
Since his London debut he has appeared all over the world on the most prestigious stages (Carnegie Hall, Royal Festival Hall, Suntory Hall, Osaka Festival Hall) with the best world's orchestras (Berliner Philharmoniker, Cleveland Symphony Orchestra, NHK Philharmonic Orchestra) as well as on the world festivals (Osaka, Salzburg, Istanbul, Perth, Helsinki). He keeps acknowledging the legacy of David Oistrach and other giants of Russian violin school. And so even today he purposefully cooperates with the holders of Oistrach's, Kogan's and Sitkovetsky's traditions as can be proved by his records in Supraphon company.
Hudeček's pleasant performance and namely his style combining a technical mastership with an emotionally rich tone connected with a verve and lust which he can pass to an audience in an unchangeable way enchant audiences of all ages. His recording of Vivaldi's Le Quatro Stagioni with the conductor Pavel Kogan dated 1992 has still been the most successful performance in the Czech Republic and the violinist received a golden and in 1997 a platinum record for it. He also received golden records for his other recordings.
Václav Hudeček does not devote himself only to old masters' compositions but widens his repertoire range by the 20th century's works (Janáček, Prokofiev) and compositions of contemporary Czech authors (Kymlička, Fišer, Mácha).
As an educator, he has been working in courses in Canada, Japan, Germany. Recently, he has been systematically helping the incoming Czech generation both on the annually held summer violin concerts in Luhačovice and by presenting the best ones as guests on his concerts as well as on his traditional Christmas concert tours or on Music Festivities organized by him in Prague.
In 2007, he was recognized by the President of the Czech Republic Václav Klaus through the “National Award for Achievement in the Area of Culture and the Arts”

Perfluorinated carboxylic acid

Perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs), or perfluorocarboxylic acids are compounds of the formula CnF(2n+1)CO2H. The simplest example is trifluoroacetic acid. These compounds are organofluorine analogues of ordinary carboxylic acids, but they are stronger by several pKa units and they exhibit great hydrophobic character. Perfluorinated dicarboxylic acids are also known, e.g. C2F4(CO2H)2.
Applications and production.
Trifluoroacetic acid is a widely employed acid, used for example in the synthesis of peptides. Its esters are useful in analytical chemistry. Longer chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids, e.g. with five to nine carbons, are useful fluorosurfactants and emulsifiers used in the production of Teflon and related fluoropolymers.
These compounds are typically prepared by electrochemical fluorination of the carboxylic acid fluorides followed by hydrolysis:
Controversy.
Larger PFCAs such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are under scrutiny because they are bioaccumulative although it is unclear whether their presence poses a risk.

Elections in Rhode Island

Since the Great Depression, Rhode Island elections have been dominated by the Rhode Island Democratic Party. However, the Rhode Island Republican Party, although virtually non-existent in the Rhode Island General Assembly, occasionally puts forward occasional state-wide reform candidates. Former Governor Donald Carcieri of East Greenwich, and former Mayor Vincent A. "Buddy" Cianci of Providence (who later became an independent political boss, and was convicted on Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act charges) ran successfully as Republican reform candidates.
Rhode Island has comprehensive health insurance for low-income children, and a large social safety net. Many urban areas still have a high rate of children in poverty. Due to an influx of residents from Boston, Massachusetts, increasing housing costs have resulted in more homeless in Rhode Island.
Prominent Democrats include House Speaker William Murphy, Senate President Joseph Montalbano, Former Providence Mayor David Cicilline, Secretary of State A. Ralph Mollis, General Treasurer Frank T. Caprio, Senate Majority Leader M. Teresa Paiva-Weed, and Lt. Gov. Elizabeth H. Roberts. In recent years, former Speaker of the House John Harwood, State Senator John Celona, and State Senate President William Irons were forced to resign amid scandals.
History.
Federalists vs. Anti-Federalists (1776-1820).
Rhode Island declared independence from the British Empire on May 4, 1776, two months before the U.S. Declaration of Independence was ratified. However, despite this eagerness for independence, Rhode Island was also a stronghold for Anti-Federalism through the Country Party, which was widely popular among rural areas of Rhode Island and dominated the Rhode Island General Assembly from 1786 to 1790. The Country Party's dominance prevented ratification of the Federalist U.S. Constitution, and the state had even refused to send any delegation to the 1787 Constitutional Convention that wrote it. Father of the Constitution James Madison described Rhode Island as ruled by "wickedness and folly" in which "All sense of character as well as of right have been obliterated." After the insurance of the inclusion of a bill of rights, however, support grew for the Constitution in Rhode Island. Rhode Island became the last of the original 13 states to ratify the Constitution in 1790 by only 2 votes, after Gov. John Collins supported it and several remaining Anti-Federalists boycotted the ratifying convention.
After ratification, many Anti-Federalists remained with the Country Party or joined Thomas Jefferson's Anti-Administration faction, which eventually became the Democratic-Republican Party. Rhode Island's first 2 governors after ratification (Anti-Federalist leader Arthur Fenner and Henry Smith) were both nominees of the Country Party. Meanwhile, one of Rhode Island's first 2 Senators, Joseph Stanton, Jr., was a nominee of the Anti-Administration Party. 
Despite the Anti-Federalist views during the 1780s, the Federalist Party eventually became the dominant party in Rhode Island. Rhode Island gave its electoral votes in most Presidential elections to the Federalist candidate during this era. Meanwhile, Federalist Senator William Bradford became the 1st U.S. Senator from Rhode Island to serve as President pro tempore of the United States Senate during the 5th Congress. While the Federalist Party is generally considered to have died after the War of 1812, Rhode Island still had Federalists in the U.S. Congress as late as 1820, and Federalist Governor William Jones was not defeated by a Democratic-Republican candidate until Nehemiah R. Knight was elected in 1816.
Democratic-Republican Era (1820s).
In the 1820s, Rhode Island, like the rest of the union, was largely dominated by the Democratic-Republican Party. Knight, William C. Gibbs, and James Fenner (son of former Governor Arthur Fenner) were all elected Governors of Rhode Island during this time. After the party split into Andrew Jackson's Democratic Party and the opposition National Republican Party, Rhode Island was generally opposed to Jackson's policies and supportive of the Federalist-inspired policies of National Republican leaders John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay, supporting the former in the hotly contested Presidential elections of 1824 and 1828. Many of these "Anti-Jacksonians" or "Adams Men", such as Asher Robbins and former Governor Nehemiah R. Knight, represented the state in Congress before the formation of the Whig Party in 1833.
Whig Era (1833-50).
Rhode Island Congressmen were almost exclusively Whigs during the 1830s and early 1840s. Whigs Lemuel H. Arnold, Elisha Harris, Henry B. Anthony, and William W. Hoppin were also Governors of Rhode Island during this time. However, Democrats John Brown Francis and William Sprague III served for most of the 1830s. Rhode Island's electoral votes also backed the Presidential candidacies of Whig leaders William Henry Harrison in 1840, Henry Clay in 1844, and Zachary Taylor in 1848.
Dorr Rebellion (1840-42).
In 1841, Rhode Island was the last state that required ownership of property to vote in its elections, as it was still governed by the provisions of its original colonial charter of 1663, which restricted voting rights to landowning white men and their eldest sons. About 60% of Rhode Island adult men were ineligible to vote due to these restrictions by 1840. Political activist Thomas Wilson Dorr was the leader of a group known as the Rhode Island Suffrage Association (or "Dorrites") that attempted to amend or replace the charter with a new constitution extending suffrage to all white men, but efforts to do so consistently failed in the Rhode Island General Assembly. 
After failed attempts to change the system from within, the Dorrites held a convention for the newly formed "People's Party", which drafted a new constitution that enfranchised all white men after one year's residence. Meanwhile, General Assembly members who supported the charter, known as "Charterites" or the "Law and Order Party", drafted a constitution that made concessions to the People's Party, but 2 referenda held later that year determined that a majority of voters approved of the People's Party constitution, but disapproved of the Law and Order Party's constitution by a narrow margin.
However, Governor Samuel Ward King, a Charterite, refused to recognize the results of the referenda, resulting in the holding of two elections that April: one set up by the People's Party, which elected Dorr as Governor, and another set up by the Law and Order Party, which re-elected King. King and Dorr essentially served as Governors concurrently after this election. King declared martial law and attempted to persuade U.S. President John Tyler to send federal soldiers to Rhode Island to resolve the issue, but Tyler, feeling that the threat of violence was "hourly diminishing", refused. Without the threat of federal interference, Dorr's government mounted an attack upon the Providence Arsenal on May 19, 1842. Charterite defenders, including Dorr's own father and uncle, suppressed the attack and the Dorrites retreated to the village of Chepachet to hold another People's Convention. Charterites cut off the retreat in the city of Woonsocket, causing Dorr's government to fall. 
Despite their victory, the Charterite General Assembly ultimately drafted and adopted the current Rhode Island Constitution in September 1842, which extended voting to all free men (of any race) who owned property or could pay a $1 poll tax. Although the former members of the People's Party attempted to oppose the Law and Order Party's candidates in the 1843 elections, the Law and Order Party took all major offices in these elections, and their new constitution was adopted in May. Encouraged by the new constitution's expanded suffrage, Dorr returned to the state, but was captured by King and tried and convicted of treason. However, public protests resulted in Dorr's pardon by Governor James Fenner in 1845.
Law and Order Party and Whig Party co-dominance (1840s).
After the Dorr Rebellion ended, the Law and Order Party shared power with the Whigs for the remainder of the 1840s, until the former dissolved and the latter fell from power in Rhode Island. The Law and Order Party's James Fenner was the first Governor elected under the Rhode Island Constitution. Fenner had previously served as Governor on two other occasions as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party. Byron Diman also represented the Law and Order Party as Governor.
In 1843, Rhode Island was given a 2nd Congressional district. The Law and Order Party's Elisha R. Potter was the first Congressman from this district. The 2nd district also elected Benjamin Babock Thurston to Congress in 1847; Thurston was the first Democrat elected to Congress from Rhode Island.
In the late 1840s and early 1850s, the nationally declining Whig Party became diminished in Rhode Island, while the Law and Order Party dissolved, and most of its members returned to their pre-Dorr Rebellion allegiances to the Whigs or Democrats.
Republican Era (1850s-1930s).
After the demise of the Rhode Island Whigs, the Know Nothing and Democratic Parties were briefly co-dominant parties in Rhode Island. From 1851 to 1853, Rhode Island had an all-Democrat set of executive offices for the first time, led by Governor Philip Allen. In the same year, Charles Tillinghast James became Rhode Island's first Democratic Senator. Meanwhile, Benjamin Babock Thurston returned to his Congressional seat as a Know-Nothing, and William W. Hoppin was Rhode Island's only Know-Nothing Governor in 1854, serving in the office until 1856.
In the late 1850s, however, much of the remaining Know-Nothings and Whigs nationally were absorbed by the Republican Party, which would become the dominant party in Rhode Island until the Great Depression of the 1930s. Republican dominance in Rhode Island began with the elections of several Republicans to major offices in 1857, such as Governor Elisha Dyer, and Sen. James F. Simmons. The first 14 Republican Party Presidential candidates, beginning with John C. Frémont in 1856, won Rhode Island's electoral votes during this era.
The Constitutional Union Party became strong in Rhode Island during the early 1860s. Across the country, many conservative former Whigs and Know-Nothings, unsatisfied with the secessionists in the national Democratic Party, became Unionists, and nominated Unionist candidates at their state conventions. Both Rhode Island representatives to the 37th U.S. House of Representatives were Unionists.
During the American Civil War, Rhode Island was the first state to respond to President Abraham Lincoln's 1861 request for troops from the individual Union states. Governor William Sprague IV (nephew of former Governor William Sprague III) believed that the war would be over rather quickly and easily in the Union's favor, and chose to lead the Rhode Island brigade to Virginia to oversee what he expected to be a Union victory. There, he participated in the First Battle of Bull Run and, despite the Confederate victory, was offered a commission as Brigadier General, which he refused, opting to remain Governor of Rhode Island. Sprague went on to serve 2 six-year terms as a Senator from Rhode Island after retiring from the Governor's post in 1863. Burnside also became a Governor of Rhode Island from 1866 to 1869, and then replaced Sprague in the U.S. Senate in 1875, serving there until his death in 1881.
From 1863 to 1887, every Governor of and U.S. Congressman from Rhode Island was a member of the Republican Party. During this time, Senator Henry B. Anthony served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate, the 2nd Rhode Island Senator to do so, after William Bradford in 1797. Also during this time, Governor Henry Lippitt became the first in a familial line of several prominent Rhode Island politicians, dating to current Governor Lincoln Chafee, and including one of Lippitt's sons, Sen. Henry F. Lippitt, who was a brother-in-law of U.S. President and Chief Justice William Howard Taft. Also, the administration of three-term Governor Alfred H. Littlefield officially established the current boundary line of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and authorized the establishment of the state's first industrial school for impoverished children, in an effort to update the state's education system to keep in time with manufacturing developments.
In 1887, some Democratic power returned when prominent Democratic businessman John W. Davis was elected Governor over incumbent Republican George P. Wetmore, with whom many in both parties were dissatisfied. During Davis' first one-year term, a women's suffrage amendment to the State Constitution was passed by the state legislature but not accepted by the state's male voters in an April 6, 1887 referendum. Also during Davis' first term, the current boundary line with Connecticut was established, revised election laws were passed which made voter fraud more difficult, and orphanages were regulated by the state. However, Davis was defeated in his 1888 and 1889 gubernatorial bids, but Davis returned to the governorship for another one-year term in 1890. Another popular Democrat during Rhode Island's Republican Era was Lucius F.C. Garvin, a longtime General Assembly member from Cumberland and eventual Governor, serving 2 one-year terms. However, a Republican-controlled legislature prevented most of Garvin's reform-minded programs from passing. Garvin was considered for the Democratic nomination for U.S. President in 1904.
In the late 19th century and early 20th century, there was much controversy in the state political system surrounding Republican leader and lobbyist Charles R. Brayton, who generally supported the interests of Republican Senators Henry B. Anthony and Nelson W. Aldrich. As both a Civil War veteran and a member of the state's "economic elite", Brayton was easily supported by the majority of Rhode Islanders, and is credited with helping many candidates into office, including Sen. Aldrich, who would later become one of the most prominent U.S. Senators. Brayton rose to political prominence in Rhode Island in the 1890s as a chairman of the Republican State Committee, and eventually as a member of the Republican National Committee. Brayton campaigned heavily for the passage of laws shifting gubernatorial powers, including almost all appointment powers, to the State Senate, which was reliably a Republican majority. The "Brayton Act" was a major hindrance to Democratic reformers such as Governor Garvin after its passage, and would continue to hinder gubernatorial power until Democrats gained a State Senate majority in 1935. Brayton also had a political rivalry with James H. Higgins, another Democratic Governor during Rhode Island's Republican Era. Higgins greatly opposed Brayton's lobbying, claiming Brayton was paid by railroad and telephone companies to lobby their special interests. Brayton did not deny this, but said that he never lobbied against the interests of the Republican Party to favor a corporation's interest.
In 1912, President Taft's reelection campaign was the first Republican campaign to not receive Rhode Island's electoral votes, despite the fact that he was a 5th cousin of former Governor Royal C. Taft. Democrat Woodrow Wilson, who won the election, was the first Democrat to receive Rhode Island's electoral votes since Franklin Pierce in 1852, before the founding of the Republican Party.
Also in 1912, the Republican ticket for executive offices, led by Aram J. Pothier, who was also the first Rhode Island Governor of foreign birth (born in Quebec), won the first 2-year executive terms, having previously served four 1-year terms.
Upon the beginning of the Great Depression in 1929, Republican Norman S. Case was Governor of Rhode Island. Although he was reelected in 1930, the Depression worsened and Republican popularity lessened, and Theodore F. Green summarily defeated Case in 1932. The Depression is generally cited as the primary reason for the fall of Republicans in Rhode Island, transitioning to a period of Democratic dominance which continues today.
Democratic Era (1930s-present).
In the 1932 and 1934 elections, Democrats officially swept Republicans out of power in the state. Theodore F. Green easily defeated Republican Governor Norman S. Case in the 1932 gubernatorial election. Democrat Peter G. Gerry, who served 2 terms in the U.S. Senate before the Depression, reclaimed his former seat by defeating incumbent Republican Senator Felix Hebert. In the State Senate elections in 1934, 2 seats were contested, both held by Republicans, but Democratic victories in these districts would create a Democratic Party majority in the Senate. Lt. Gov. Robert Quinn, assigned to preside over seating the newly elected State Senators, refused to seat the Republicans who had claimed re-election to those two seats. Green demanded a recount on January 1, 1935, and the recount determined that the Democratic candidates in both districts had won by narrow margins. This has become known as the "Bloodless Revolution", as Republicans have struggled to regain power in Rhode Island since.
Republicans remained in some power throughout the 1930s, as Charles Risk served the 1st Congressional district in the 74th and 76th Congresses. In 1938, many Republicans, led by gubernatorial candidate William Henry Vanderbilt III, was elected into office, including retaking control of both houses of the General Assembly. However, in 1939, Vanderbilt's support was seriously weakened by a wire-tapping scandal involving a private detective he had hired to search for election fraud. The scandal cost him his re-election chances, and many Republicans elected in 1938 were defeated by Democratic challengers in 1940; Democrats also regained a majority in both houses of the General Assembly, and have not lost it since.
Meanwhile, many prominent Rhode Island Democrats also became nationally prominent under Democratic Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. The most notable of these was former Governor Green, who successfully ran for Senate in 1936, and served there until 1960, finally retiring in ill health at age 93, the oldest Congressman in history at the time. Green was known as "the President's man", as a strong supporter of Democratic Presidents, and one of Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower's strongest Democratic supporters. Green was also a civil rights leader, working closely with then-Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson to pass voting rights bills, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1957. The state's largest airport is named T.F. Green Airport after him. 
J. Howard McGrath, first a Governor after defeating incumbent Vanderbilt in 1940, also went on to serve for many years in a federal capacity. McGrath was appointed U.S. Solicitor General by Truman in October 1945, and served there for one year, before resigning to become a Senator in the 80th Congress, which had Republican majorities in both houses. However, he chaired the U.S. Senate Committee on the District of Columbia at the beginning of the Democrat-ruled 81st Congress. McGrath was also chairman of the Democratic National Committee during this time, allowing for racial integration of the Democrats' national headquarters and successfully managing President Truman's 1948 reelection campaign. For this, McGrath was promoted to United States Attorney General, until his resignation in 1952, after refusing to be investigated after suspected corruption.
Democratic Party.
The Rhode Island Democratic Party is the affiliate of the Democratic Party in the state of Rhode Island. Edwin R. Pacheco is the chairman of the Party. For the past five decades, the Democratic Party has dominated politics in Rhode Island. The article further discusses the Democratic Party's dominance in Rhode Island politics as well as the elected officials, party leadership and staff, past election results, legislation, and also issue stance.
Moderate Party.
The Moderate Party of Rhode Island is the third-largest contemporary political party in the U.S. state of Rhode Island, after the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. The Moderate Party of Rhode Island gained official party status and ballot access via a federal lawsuit and the gathering of 34,000 signatures on August 18, 2009.
Republican Party.
The Rhode Island Republican Party is the affiliate of the United States Republican Party in Rhode Island. Mark Zaccaria is the Party Chairman; Pat Sweeney is the Executive Director. 
The Republican Party was formed by former northern anti-slavery Whigs, Democrats, and other northern politicians. The anti-slavery Republicans absorbed most of the American Party, Whigs, the Know-Nothings and Unionists by 1857.

Lenore Lake (Saskatchewan)

Lenore Lake is a partly saline lake in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. It is part of the Lenore Lake Basin, which includes several saline lakes (Basin, Middle, Frog, Ranch, Murphy, Flat, Mantrap, Houghton, Deadmoose and Waldsea) as well as the freshwater St. Brieux Lake and Burton Lake. The basin has no natural outlet. Lenore Lake was designated a migratory bird sanctuary in 1925 and sustains a habitat for walleye, whitefish, perch and northern pike.
Environmental concerns.
In recent years, water levels in the basin have risen to historic levels. Nearby Houghton Lake, a highly saline body of water, has drained water into Lenore Lake. To prevent the highly saline water from damaging the fish habitat in Lenore Lake, Environment Canada ordered the permanent closure of a culvert between the two lakes on May 10, 2010.
In 2009, Saskatchewan's Ministry of the Environment issued fish consumption guidelines for walleye and northern pike taken from Lenore Lake, due to the level of mercury detected in the fish.

Hanneli Goslar

Hannah 'Hanneli' Elizabeth Goslar (born November 12, 1928) is a former nurse who is best known for her strong and close friendship with diarist Anne Frank. Both Hannah and Anne had attended the Sixth Public Montessori School (now the Anne Frank School) in Amsterdam and then the Jewish Lyceum.
Early life.
Hanneli Elizabeth Pick-Goslar was born in Berlin, Germany on 12 November, 1928, the eldest child of Hans Goslar and Ruth Judith Klee. Her father was deputy minister for domestic affairs in Germany until 1933 and her mother was a teacher. Both of her parents were observant Jews. Her mother died giving birth to her third child; the baby was stillborn. In 1933, after the election of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party to the Reichstag and Hitler's appointment as Chancellor, Hans Goslar was forced to resign his governmental job. After an abortive attempt to move to England, where Hans Goslar could not find work that would allow him to stay home on the Sabbath, the Goslars moved to Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Hannah attended the Sixth Public Montessori school in Amsterdam, where she became best friends with Anne Frank. Anne and Hannah were also best and close friends with :Susanne "Sanne" Ledermann, who lived in the same area but attended a different school, and later with Ilse Wagner and Jacqueline van Maarsen.
Arrest and concentration camp life.
In 1943, Hannah, her father, her maternal grandparents, along with Hannah's younger sister Gabriela ("Gabi"), were arrested and sent to Westerbork, a transit camp, and then eventually to the exchange camp of Bergen-Belsen. Hannah was in a privileged section of the camp because her family had Palestine passports with them. Sometime between January-February 1945, Hannah was briefly reunited with Anne Frank, who was a less privileged prisoner imprisoned at the other side of the camp. Hannah passed Anne a package with some bread and socks in it. Hannah and Gabi survived 14 months at Bergen-Belsen. Her father and maternal grandparents all died of a sickness before the liberation. Hannah and Gabi were the only members of their family to survive the war, and in 1947, they immigrated to Jerusalem, Israel.
Present life.
Hannah married Dr Walter Pinchass, and they have three children. Hannah still lives in Jerusalem and she has ten grandchildren.
Hannah has appeared in several documentaries related to Anne Frank, including in the 1988 documentary "The Last Seven Months of Anne Frank", the 1995 documentary "Anne Frank Remembered" and the 2008 documentary "Classmates of Anne Frank".

Todd Gloria

Todd Rex Gloria (born May 10, 1978) is an American elected official in San Diego, California. He served as the interim Mayor of San Diego after the resignation of former mayor Bob Filner in August 2013. His term as interim mayor concluded on March 3, 2014, when mayor-elect Kevin Faulconer was sworn in.
In addition to serving as interim mayor, Gloria is a City Council member representing District 3 and serves as president of the nine-member Council. He was elected to a four-year City Council term in 2008; he was re-elected and chosen as council president in 2012. He is a Democrat, although city council positions are officially nonpartisan per California state law. 
Life and career.
Gloria is a third generation San Diegan, all four of his grandparents having moved to San Diego because of their involvement with the military. He has described his ethnic background in an interview as being: "asically half Native American (Tlingit-Haida, an Alaskan tribe), a quarter Filipino and then a little bit of Dutch and Puerto Rican."
He grew up in the Clairemont neighborhood and attended Madison High School. He was interested in politics from childhood. At age 10 he was runner-up in a "mayor for a day" contest. At 14 he volunteered to work for Democratic candidates in the 1992 election.
Gloria graduated "summa cum laude" from the University of San Diego, with majors in history and political science. While a student at USD, Gloria was active in the effort to add "sexual orientation" to the campus nondiscrimination policy.
U.S. Congresswoman Susan Davis has been his political mentor ever since they first met in 1993, when Gloria was a high school freshman and Davis was the director of a leadership and cross-cultural understanding program for high school students. In 2002, Gloria became Davis's district director, a position he held until being elected to the city council in 2008.
While working for Davis, Gloria also served as a San Diego Housing Commissioner from 2005 until 2008. Openly gay, he is also a former chairman of the San Diego LGBT Community Center and was a resident panelist on San Diego's Prostitution Impact Panel.
San Diego City Council.
Gloria ran for the District 3 seat vacated by the termed-out Toni Atkins in the 2008 election. He received a plurality of votes in the June 2008 primary election, leading to a November run off election against fellow Democrat Stephen Whitburn, a former journalist, community activist and ally of then District 6 councilmember Donna Frye. Gloria defeated Whitburn with 54.3% of the vote.
In the 2012 election, Gloria ran for re-election unopposed and was re-elected in the June primary. As of his second term, District 3 includes the neighborhoods of Balboa Park, Bankers Hill/Park West, Downtown San Diego, Golden Hill, Hillcrest, Little Italy, Mission Hills, Normal Heights, North Park, Old Town, and University Heights. In December 2012, at its first meeting after new members took office, Gloria was unanimously elected to serve as Council President, replacing retiring President Tony Young.
Gloria has been chair of the city's Budget and Finance Committee since 2011. Gloria represents San Diego on the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System Board and SANDAG, where he chairs the transportation committee.
Upon the resignation of Mayor Bob Filner on August 30, 2013, Gloria became the interim mayor of San Diego, with limited powers. This made San Diego the second largest city in the United States (after Houston) to have an openly gay mayor at that time. He served until March 3, 2014 when mayor-elect Kevin Faulconer was sworn in. While serving as interim mayor he remained the city councilmember for District 3 and retained the title of city council president; however, City Council President Pro Tem Sherri Lightner carried out the duties of the council president. Gloria was considered a possible candidate to replace Filner, but he chose not to run.
As interim mayor Gloria reversed several of Filner's actions. In September 2013 he ordered city police and zoning code officers to resume enforcement actions against medical marijuana shops; in one of his first actions as mayor, Filner had ordered city staff to stop such enforcement. He also announced the city will re-hire lobbying firms in Sacramento and Washington that Filner had fired. He ordered that public records be made more quickly and easily available to citizens, in contrast to the cumbersome centralized process established by Filner.

Afghan biscuit

An Afghan biscuit is a traditional New Zealand biscuit made from flour, butter, cornflakes, sugar and cocoa powder, topped with chocolate icing and a half walnut. The recipe has a high proportion of butter, and relatively low sugar, and no leavening (rising agent), giving it a soft, dense and rich texture, with crunchiness from the cornflakes, rather than from a high sugar content. The high butter content gives a soft melt-in-the-mouth texture, and the sweetness of the icing offsets the low sugar and the cocoa bitterness. The origin of the recipe and the derivation of the name are unknown, but the recipe has appeared in many editions of the influential New Zealand Edmonds Cookery Book.

<doc id="21552604" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21552604" title="Steelfab">
Steelfab

Steelfab was a Cardiff, Wales based engineering firm that built the ""Steelfab Digger"", a competitor to HyMac and JCB excavators in the 1960s. The company also built the "Horndraulic" brand of front loaders for fitting to agricultural tractors.
Background.
Steelfab.
Steel Fabricators Limited was founded in Birmingham in 1935 to manufacture pressed and sheet metal work. During the 1939 to 1945 period the company was solely engaged on government contracts, and the factory occupied an area of , and there were some 50 employees.
In 1946, to meet expansion plans, the company relocated to Pengam Road, Cardiff and won large contracts, including supplying the frames for the BISF house project and Rigid Form beams for the then Ministry of Works.
History.
In the early 'fifties' it was decided to go into the backhoe loader market, which resulted in the introduction of the "Scout" Digger, manufactured under license to the "Shawnee Manufacturing Company" of the USA. Many hundreds of "Scout" diggers were sold, but the unit did have its limitations and the "Shawnee Warrior" digger was designed to supersede the Scout.
In 1952 a subsidiary company was formed in Australia and this Company had a modern plant on the Moorabbin Industrial Estate near Melbourne, Victoria.
In 1954, a license was finalized with the "Shawnee Company, U.S.A.", to manufacture and market "Shawnee" industrial loaders and diggers and those products formed a major part of the Company's range.
In 1958, a license agreement was made with "H.G. Poole Limited" to manufacture and market Shawnee Poole Rear Dump Haulers, which enjoyed considerable success throughout the world and were leaders in the articulated dumper field.
In 1959, Steel Fabricators (Cardiff) Ltd., was taken over by the Adamant & Western Group and became a member of the Adwest Group.
Later that year Steelfab carried a market survey was carried out with a view to introducing a combination unit as opposed to the Shawnee Warrior type attachment digger. The Steelfab project started in 1960 and the Unit was designed to fall between the JCB 4 and Massey Ferguson backhoe loaders models.
Several hundred 160/180 combinations units were built but the early models were built on the light weight Fordson Dexta skid unit which was not strong enough to carry the stresses produced by a backhoe loader and units started to fail. This proved futial in the success of the product and although the larger International Harvester B2275 skid was introduced as a replacement it was too late for its reputation.
A larger 170/180 model was launched in the late 1960s with a much stronger and more powerful Ford 5000 skid but sales were limited and only around 60 units were sold and production ceased in approximately 1972
The Horndraulic '800' digger was first produced during the latter part of 1965 and received considerable acceptance on the market and a larger 900 was later produced. This machine mounted on the rear of tractors. The 800 diggers used the tractor hydraulics to power the digger although a pump system powered by the tractor PTO was offered as an option. The 900 digger incorporated a pump system run from the tractor PTO as part of its design.
Steelfab also manufactured front end loaders for fitment to many different tractor marques and models under the brand name "Horndraulic" originally under license from the USA. For some time Steelfab manufactured front end loaders for Ford and Leyland tractor which were marketed under the Ford and Leyland brand names by their dealers.
The designer of the 800 and 900 digger who had joined Steelfab from the HyMac company later went on to design a scissor design tipper trailer known as the Power X System and later left Steelfab and set up business building mini excavators known as Powerfab.
The Steelfab SF 122 loader was used to build the "Roadless 700" Tractor loader in 1968. This machine based on the Roadless Plougemaster 65 and 75 tractors. Six were supplied to Israel between 1969 and 1972. The original prototype is believed to be the only one in existence. These were unusual machines as they had a Brockhouse torque converter transmission but were based on a Ford tractor.
Competition.
At this time the market was very competitive with several firms offering alternatives to the JCB excavators. HyMac Limited later took over Whitlock Bros. of Great Yeldham in Essex Manufacturing The HyMac 370 backhoe loader range.

The Calling is the ninth studio album released from country music singer Mary Chapin Carpenter. It is the follow-up album to her 2004 album, "Between Here and Gone". "The Calling" was released on March 6, 2007 on Zoë Records. Carpenter had previously been on Columbia Nashville, this being her first release from leaving the label. Like her previous album, she wrote every track on the album.
From the album, two singles were released. "On With the Song" and "It Must Have Happened", were released, but neither of which charted on the "Billboard" Hot Country Songs. Although Carpenter hasn't had a charting single since 2001s "Simple Life", "The Calling" reached its peak of #10 on the "Billboard" Top Country Albums chart.
Reception.
Thom Jurek of Allmusic said "Time will tell, of course, but in "The Calling", Carpenter may have her finest moment yet; it also feels like an artistic rebirth. These songs come from her marrow and the conviction she sings them with proves it. Carpenter and her co-producer Matt Rollings should be awfully proud of this one." The album was also given 4 stars out of 5.

David Lyall

David Lyall (1817–1895) MD, RN, FLS, was a Scottish botanist who explored Antarctica, New Zealand, the Arctic and North America and was a lifelong friend of Sir Joseph Hooker. He was born in Auchenblae, Kincardineshire, Scotland on 1 June 1817.
He graduated in medicine from Aberdeen, having previously been admitted a Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. Lyall entered the Royal Navy in 1839 and was immediately appointed, on 6 June, as assistant surgeon on , under Captain Francis Crozier (1796–1848), one of the two ships forming Sir James Clark Ross's Expedition to the Antarctic. The ships were the first to penetrate the Antarctic pack ice and to confirm the existence of the great southern continent. Hooker and Lyall made good use of their time botanizing on Kerguelen Island. Lyall had the rare distinction of having a whole genus, "Lyallia", named after him, by Hooker.
Hooker noted in his "Flora Antarctica":
Among his many important botanical discoveries in this survey was that of the monarch of all buttercups, the gigantic white-flowered Ranunculus lyallii, the only known species with peltate leaves, the ‘water-lily’ of the New Zealand shepherds.--Joseph Dalton Hooker (1895) 33 "Journal of Botany", p. 209.

Delta 4000

The Delta 4000 series was an American expendable launch system which was used to conduct two orbital launches in 1989 and 1990. It was a member of the Delta family of rockets. Although several variants were put forward, only the Delta 4925 was launched. The designations used a four digit numerical code to store information on the configuration of the rocket. It was built from a combination of spare parts left over from earlier Delta rockets, which were being retired, and parts from the Delta II 6000-series, which was just entering service.
The first stage was the MB-3-III powered Extended Long Tank Thor, previously flown on the 1000-series. Nine Castor-4A solid rocket boosters were attached to increase thrust at lift-off, replacing the less powerful Castor-4 boosters used on the 3000 series. The Delta-K was used as a second stage. A Star-48B PAM-D was used as a third stage, to boost payloads into geosynchronous transfer orbit.
Both Delta 4000 launches occurred from Launch Complex 17B at Cape Canaveral. The first launched Marco Polo 1 for BSkyB, and the second launched INSAT 1D for the Indian Space Research Organisation. Both were successful.

Mannar Electoral District

Mannar Electoral District was an electoral district of Sri Lanka between August 1947 and February 1989. The district was named after the town of Mannar in Mannar District, Northern Province. The 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka introduced the proportional representation electoral system for electing members of Parliament. The existing 160 mainly single-member electoral districts were replaced with 22 multi-member electoral districts. Mannar electoral district was replaced by the Vanni multi-member electoral district at the 1989 general elections, the first under the PR system, though Mannar continues to be a polling division of the multi-member electoral district.

Nicolai A. Grevstad

Nicolai A. Grevstad (2 June 1851 - 20 February 1940) was an American diplomat, politician and newspaper editor.
Background.
Nicolai Andreas Grevstad was born in Sunnmøre, the southernmost traditional district of the western Norwegian county of Møre og Romsdal. He graduated with a degree in law from the University of Christiania in 1878. In 1880 he became editor of "Dagbladet", Norway's third largest newspaper. Founded in 1869, the newspaper was affiliated with the Liberal Party of Norway (Norwegian: "Venstre"). A split in the party caused the dismissal of Grevstad in 1883 because of his somewhat pronounced radical political positions.
Career.
Grevstad subsequently emigrated to the United States and soon became editor of "Nordvesten", a Norwegian language newspaper published in St. Paul, Minnesota. Grevstad’s mastery of the English language was so excellent that he was a leading editorial writer on the "Minneapolis Tribune" for two years, and he later edited the "Minneapolis Times". Grevstad also served as director of Scandinavian publicity for the Minnesota Commission of Public Safety . 
In 1886 he returned to Norway at the request of the Liberal Party leader Johan Sverdrup, who served as prime minister after the introduction of the parliamentary system the prior year. Sverdrup served as Prime Minister of Norway from 1884 until 1889. Grevstad subsequently returned to the Minnesota and became an editorial writer for a number of English language newspapers in Minneapolis. 
From 1892 to 1911, he was editor of "Skandinaven", the largest Norwegian language newspaper in Chicago, Illinois. For a period he was a member of the Illinois General Assembly. In 1906, he was knighted into the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav. In 1911, he became an Ambassador of the United States to Uruguay and Paraguay.
In 1930, Grevstad, wrote "Norwegian-American Hospital, Chicago" which provided a concise historic sketch of the north side Chicago hospital which had been founded by Norwegian immigrants. Grevstad later returned to newspaper work and in 1930 again became editor of "Skandinaven". Grevstad emphasized the growing importance of "Skandinaven" in politics by printing many of his editorials in English as well as Norwegian. Under his editorship, the paper reached the height of its circulation and influence in the first decade of the twentieth century. After Grevstad’s death, the paper would be edited by Reidar Rye Haugan.

John Handcox

John L. Handcox (1904-1992) was a Great Depression-era tenant farmer and union advocate from Arkansas renowned for his politically charged songs and poetry. Handcox is noted for playing a "vital role in bettering the lives of sharecroppers and energizing labor union organizers and members." Despite his brief career, many of his songs were so popular that they became standard folk songs themselves, and continue to be sung today. 
Biography.
Handcox was born February 5, 1904, in Brinkley, Arkansas. As a child he admired the poetry of Paul Laurence Dunbar, although he only attended school to the ninth grade. Handcox's father was a landowner, but they lost their property when he was crushed by a wagon.
In 1935, Handcox joined the Southern Tenant Farmers Union and began writing songs and poetry to rally the group's members. Two years later, Charles Seeger and Sidney Robertson recorded him for the Library of Congress. His songs were later promoted by fellow protest songsters, Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie, and Joe Glazer. After disappearing from the public eye for almost forty years, Handcox emerged in the 1980s for the 50th anniversary celebration of the STFU in Memphis. In 1984, he composed two songs criticizing the presidency of Ronald Reagan. In November 2013 Michael Honey, a professor at the University of Washington Tacoma published a biography of Handcox's life, titled "Sharecropper's Troubador: John L. Handcox, the Southern Tenant Farmer's Union, and the African American Song Tradition." Honey was introduced to Handcox by Pete Seeger in 1985 and recorded and interviewed him at the Library of Congress that same year.

Robert Fong

Robert King Fong (born 1960) is a United States Democratic Party politician who is a former member of the Sacramento City Council. He was first elected to that post in 2004 and was reelected in 2008 without opposition. In December of 2012, he was replaced by Steve Hansen.
Education.
Fong is an alumnus of the University of California where he received his undergraduate degree and the University of California at Davis law school where he received his juris doctorate.
Board of education.
Fong served on the Sacramento City Unified School District Board of Education for 6 years from 1998 until 2004. When he initially ran for the board, Fong was part of a slate of candidates put up by the late mayor Joe Serna who was attempting to have more control over the struggling, urban school district. He was the president of the board from 2000 until he resigned to take his council seat in 2004.
Issues Facing the Board.
During his time on the board, several controversial issues were dealt with including but not limited to charter schools, teacher contracts and the California Administrative Services Authority (CASA), a pension plan for top administrators that many considered legally questionable.
California Administrative Services Authority.
In regards to the pension plan, CALPERS, the public employee retirement system in California found that the plan was invalid and that the district owed millions to the retirement system. Another audit found it legally questionable and that it possibly left the district owing ten million dollars in liability.
Charter Schools and Sacramento High School.
With regards to charter schools, the primary issue was the closure of Sacramento High School, the city's oldest high school and letting St. HOPE, an organization run by Kevin Johnson a former NBA star who is now Sacramento's mayor take it over. Due to his support of the conversion, Fong had a recall drive looming against him by the Take Back Our Schools Committee.
Other Community Service.
Fong has served as the president of the Asian American Bar Association of Sacramento. He also served on the Asian Pacific Chamber of Commerce board of directors. He was also a board member of the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board.
2004 Election.
Fong declared his candidacy for the 4th district council seat which covers much of the Land Park area of Sacramento after Jimmie Yee, who had served on the city council since 1992 except for a brief stint in 2000 announced that he was not going to run again. Fong faced minimal opposition, garnering 77% of the vote to his opponent, Joan King's, 23% of the vote. Joan King, a PR consultant was one of the people who attempted to pursue the recall bid against Fong for his actions on the school board.
Arena Tax.
Fong was a big proponent along with then mayor Heather Fargo of Measures Q and R which were on the 2006 ballot that would have levied a sales tax against Sacramento residents in order to build a new arena for the Sacramento Kings at the Railyards in Downtown Sacramento.
2008 Election.
Fong faced no opposition in his bid for reelection in 2008. The race that garnered a significant amount of attention in Sacramento was the mayoral race between Heather Fargo and Kevin Johnson. Fong decided to support Fargo, the incumbent,

In the period of 1990-1993 he was in the state of negotiations with the Russian Federation. One notable issue that was raised was the withdrawal of the Russian troops stationed in Lithuania, whereupon Lithuania and Russia signed an agreement that declared that all of the Russian troops stationed on the territory of Lithuania must withdraw by August 31, 1993. The agreement was concluded on schedule. 
In the late 1990s, Butkevičius was under the suspicion of fraud. On August 12, 1997, he was apprehended by the Lithuanian secret service agents in a hotel lobby while accepting 15,000 US dollars. After a brief explanation, he was permitted to leave. On August 14 criminal proceedings were instituted against him. He was eventually arrested on October 28, whereupon he was imprisoned and sentenced to five and a half years in jail. He was released on March 20, 2000. 
Subsequently, he appealed to the European Court of Human Rights. He stated that his detention was unlawful and that Articles 5 and 6 were breached. The court held the fact that these articles certainly were breached and that Lithuania was ordered to pay Butkevičius compensation.

Cronk ny Arrey Laa

Cronk ny Arrey Laa is a hill in the south west of the Isle of Man. It may be confused with a hill of a similar name in the parish of Jurby, further north along the west coast of the island.
At it is the second highest hill in this part of the island, after the South Barrule, 2 miles (3 km) to the east. It is in the parish of Rushen, although the boundary with the parish of Patrick is only about 200 metres to the north of its summit.
Name.
Its name means "Hill of the Day Watch" due to it having been used as a look out post for invaders during the time of the Viking invasions.
The mountain is also known locally as Cronk ny Irree-Laa, meaning "hill of the rising day" or "dawn". It was said that when the sun broke over this hill, it was a sign to the herring-fishers to shoot their nets.
Features.
Its steep western slope rises directly out of the sea in a cliff.
The area surrounding it has also been described by Trail Magazine as "some of the wildest terrain on any British coast path". and by Manx National Heritage as "amongst the most spectacular to be seen anywhere in the British Isles."
However, the summit is only about 500 metres from the main road between Port Erin/Port St Mary and Peel, and may be climbed as part of an easy day walk between those places. The summit is on the long distance path, the Raad ny Foillan. 
The summit is one of the few places anywhere with views of what Manx people call "the six kingdoms" (Mann, England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, and Heaven), with some adding a seventh "kingdom", Neptune (the sea). The boggy slopes are home to unusual plant species such as the parasitic Sundew.
Pilgrimage site.
This is an ancient place of pilgrimage. Two particular sites on the slopes of Cronk ny Arrey Laa were visited: the "Chibbyr ny Vashtey" (well of baptism) and the Manx "Keil" (chapel) at Lag ny Keeilley on the steep western face.

In 1879 at age twenty, he worked on the surveying gang for the International-Great Northern Railroad to Palestine, Texas. He later became a land speculator for Jay Gould. He drilled artesian wells in the Rio Grande Valley. In 1887, the town of Yoakum, Texas was named for him. 
From before 1888 to 1892, Yoakum worked for the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway as general manager and traffic manager. From 1893 to 1896, he was general manager and third vice president for the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railroad. In 1896, he became vice president and general manager of the Frisco Railroad. He became president in 1900, and chairman of the board in 1904.
Other positions Yoakum held were president of the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad, 1902-1904, afterwards chairman of the board; president, Evansville and Terre Haute Railroad, 1904, afterwards chairman; president, St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway after 1905; and chairman of the executive committee, Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad after 1905.
According to the "Handbook of Texas",
In 1905 the Frisco and Rock Island lines were joined, and Yoakum was the chairman of the executive committee. This line was known as the Yoakum Line and at the time was the largest railroad system under a single control. His career was one of the most colorful of the many men in railroad history.
Unfortunately, between 1911 and 1913, the Frisco suffered devastating financial losses from coal strikes, flooding of the tracks in Louisiana and Arkansas, and loss of business due to the Mexican Revolution. "Yoakum's Dream" ended when the Frisco entered bankruptcy in 1913 and was shorn of its Gulf Coast Lines as well as its affiliation with the Rock Island.
In 1907, Yoakum moved to New York, where he became president of the Empire Bond and Mortgage Company. In his later years, Yoakum gave lectures and wrote popular magazine articles about the railroads, and advocated agricultural cooperatives to help farmers, whose problems he was deeply interested in. 
Yoakum died at his home in New York on November 28, 1929, at age 70. He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in New York City.
In 1932, Yoakum's heirs sold his country home, located in Old Bethpage on Long Island, to the State of New York, which developed the property into Bethpage State Park. The park's famous Black Course has hosted golf's U.S. Open twice.
Family.
A brother, Charles Henderson Yoakum (1849-1909), was a Texas state legislator and United States Congressman. Another brother, Finis E. Yoakum (1851-1920), was a faith healer and social reformer.
Yoakum married Elizabeth Bennett of San Antonio, daughter of a prominent banker. They had two daughters, one of whom, Bessie F. Yoakum, married Francis Rham Larkin in 1913.

Underhill Burying Ground

The Underhill Burying Ground is a cemetery located within the Village of Lattingtown, in the Town of Oyster Bay in Nassau County, New York. The cemetery has been in continuous operation since the burial of Captain John Underhill in 1672. The Underhill Burying Ground is governed by the Underhill Burying Ground, Inc., a non-profit organization, incorporated under the laws of the State of New York. 
Origins and history.
The Underhill Burying Ground is located upon a portion of approximately 150 acres that was granted by the Lenape Native Americans to Captain John Underhill in 1667. This area was originally called Matinecock, after the village of one of the Lenape bands; today it is within the Village of Lattingtown. Captain John Underhill was buried here on his own land in 1672. An organization was formed by family descendants in 1843 to manage and protect the family burying ground. 
The Underhill Society of America commissioned an imposing obelisk and monument, which was erected on the burial site of Captain John Underhill on May 18, 1907. The Society paid $6,000 for the monument, and reinterred the "fighting captain" in its foundation. Made of white polished granite, the obelisk is topped by a bronze eagle with extended wings and perched on a bronze ball. On each side of the six-foot square base are four bronze tablets depicting the life of Underhill.
Colonel John T. Underhill, then president of the Underhill Society of America invited President Theodore Roosevelt to attend a formal ceremony to dedicate the monument. A letter from Roosevelt on April 3, 1908, accepted the invitation and agreed to "say a few words." At the dedication ceremony on July 11, 1908, Roosevelt gave an address on "A Good Soldier and a Good Citizen". The President talked about the duties of citizenship as exemplified by the Underhill family. He denounced Socialism and gave his views on the proper regulation of private business fortunes.
The main bronze informational plaque on the monument has the following inscription:
Captain John Underhill
Statesman Soldier
Born Baginton, Warwickshire, England, Oct. 7, 1597
Died Matinecock, Long Island, July 21, 1672
Coming to America in 1630 Underhill became prominent in the government of the colonies and achieved a high reputation as a soldier in the war with the Indians. To his memory this monument is erected by the Underhill Society of America as a tribute of respect and esteem to the founder of the family in America, May 18, 1907.
Also included on the plaque were names of the Underhill Society of America members at the time of the monument dedication. These included Col. John Torboss Underhill, President; Walter Lispenard Suydam, First Vice President; Edward King, Second Vice President; Daniel Oscar Underhill, Third Vice President; David Harris Underhill, Cor. Sec. & Family Historian; Mrs. Marianna Underhill Cocks, Asst. Cor. Secretary; Silas Albertson Underhill, Recording Secretary; Edward DeLacey Underhill, Asst. Rec. Secretary; George William Cocks, Honorary Secretary; Irving Underhill, Treasurer; Reuben Howes Underhill, Counsel.
Names of members of the Monument Committee were also included on the plaque. These included: Colonel John T. Underhill, Chairman; Hon. John Quincy Adams Underhill; Francis Jay Underhill; Charles Munson Underhill; Irving Underhill; Caleb Fowler Underhill; William Anderson Underhill. Patrons who supported the erection of the monument were also listed on the plaque and included Mrs. Robert Ogden Doremus and Mrs. Lydia Greene Lawrence.
The Underhill Burying Ground, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1909.
Myron C. Taylor, a descendant of Captain John Underhill, was instrumental in assuring perpetual maintenance of the Underhill Burying Ground by establishing a fund whose interest is used to maintain the cemetery. Descendants of Captain John Underhill may purchase burial rights by submitting an application to the Secretary of the Underhill Burying Ground, Inc.
Records of Burials.
The research document "Historic Cemeteries of Oyster Bay" lists 124 known interments at the Underhill Burying Ground. Surnames with multiple burials follow by order of prevalence: Underhill (42), Feeks (17), Cocks (15), Golden (9), Cox (8), Parish (4), Udall (4), Feekes (3), Latting (3), Fekes (2), Heley (2), Fisher (2), and Secker (2). The following surnames have only one known burial, but are nonetheless represented: Cashow, Cock, Cozzens, Dickson, Hicks, Miller, Sweet, Thorne, Weeks, Wilbur, and Wilbus.
The Underhill Burying Ground, Inc., has kept extensive records of all burials. Detailed surveys have also been completed, including one by Mary Jane Layton Lippert in March 1998. The Lippert report documented 310 burials, several of which were listed simply as "Unknown."

Mullaitivu Electoral District

Mullaitivu Electoral District was an electoral district of Sri Lanka between July 1977 and February 1989. The district was named after the town of Mullaitivu in Mullaitivu District, Northern Province. The 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka introduced the proportional representation electoral system for electing members of Parliament. The existing 160 mainly single-member electoral districts were replaced with 22 multi-member electoral districts. Mullaitivu electoral district was replaced by the Vanni multi-member electoral district at the 1989 general elections, the first under the PR system, though Mullaitivu continues to be a polling division of the multi-member electoral district.

X. M. Sellathambu and all other TULF MPs boycotted Parliament from the middle of 1983 for a number of reasons: they were under pressure from Sri Lankan Tamil militants not to stay in Parliament beyond their normal six-year term; the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka required them to swear an oath unconditionally renouncing support for a separate state; and the Black July riots in which up to 3,000 Tamils were murdered by Sinhalese mobs. After three months of absence, Sellathambu forfeited his seat in Parliament on 21 October 1983.

In Hawaii, most EOWS 612 sirens are green and yellow.
In the rest of America, EOWS Sirens can be found in various colors, including brown, black, gray, blue, and yellow. The color of the siren can be indicative of its age. The sirens in the '80s were painted in either Civil Defense yellow or dark gray, and early 90s models were painted light gray, and were almost white.

Roger Gaskell Hetherington

Sir Roger Gaskell Hetherington CB, OBE (10 February 1876, Sherborne – 1952) was a British civil engineer and civil servant.
Life.
Roger Gaskell Hetherington was born in Sherborne, Dorset on 10 February 1876, the eldest son of William Lonsdale Hetherington and his wife Mary Gaskell, daughter of John Dakin Gaskell, a barrister of Highgate, London. His father was assistant Master at Sherborne School when he was born, but the family soon after returned to Highgate.
He entered Highgate School in 1889. After school he attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where he gained a half blue for rifle shooting. In spite of coming from a distinguished academic family Hetherington did not shine academically at this time, in fact he retained, to the end of this life, a copy of the Granta magazine (16 June 1897) that included the comment "I understand that Mr Hetherington of Trinity, is exceedingly annoyed at having missed the wooden spoon. It is one blot on an otherwise blameless career." This comment resulted from his coming bottom but one in the Mathematical Tripos. The bound copy of Granta is now held by his grandson, Roger Hetherington Macdonald.
Hetherington served as an officer in the 4th (Cambridge University) Volunteer Battalion of the Suffolk Regiment but resigned his commission as Captain on 24 November 1897. Hetherington returned to the British Army during the First World War when he was appointed temporary Inspector of Works in the Staff of the Royal Engineers with the honorary rank of Lieutenant on 14 April 1915. 
All his life he suffered from a weak heart and was never passed fit for active service. He relinquished that commission upon the completion of his service on 25 February 1919, retaining his rank. Hetherington married Honoria Ford on 24 April 1906. She was the youngest daughter of the solicitor Arthur Ranken Ford, who lived close (1 Broadlands Road) to Roger's parents in Highgate (3 Broadlands Road). They had a daughter and three sons, the second of whom was Sir Arthur Ford Hetherington (1911–2002) who was Chairman of British Gas plc. Honoria studied Classics at Girton College, Cambridge but as Cambridge did not then grant women full degree status she in fact received a degree from Trinity College, Dublin. Both Roger and Honoria were strong believers in women's education and as well as making sure that Mary had a university education Roger always travelled to Cambridge to vote for women having full degree rights at Cambridge.
Hetherington had become a governor at Highgate School in 1917. He served the school as treasurer and chairman of governors from 1929 to 1944. He had an interest in education and was also chairman of the council of Wycombe Abbey School. Hetherington's career as a civil servant began in 1930 when he became the Chief Engineering Inspector at the Ministry of Health, a post he would hold until 1944. He became an official adviser on water and the Director of Surveys for the ministry in 1941 in which capacity he served until 1952. 
Hetherington had been appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1918, a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1932 and was made Knight Bachelor in 1945. On 24 June 1947, at a special general meeting of the Institution of Civil Engineers, he was elected their president for the November 1947 to November 1948 session. Hetherington was only elected because the death of the president-elect Sir Frederick Cook following his election in May. This was the second successive year that the ICE's president-elect had died before entering office. Hetherington died in 1952. His eldest son Roger Le Geyt Hetherington (1908–1990) was president of the ICE for 1972-3.

Amiga Ranger Chipset

Amiga Ranger was a prototype computer that was supposed to be the second generation Amiga chipset prior to ECS. It was designed by the original Los Gatos Amiga team including Jay Miner. However Commodore International didn't release this chipset due to its high cost
History.
After the release of the A1000, Jay Miner intended to design a true successor to it. It was planned to be highly expandable like A2000 with better graphics and CPU, this machine was code named Amiga Ranger and its design began c. 1986-1987. The Ranger may have included a 68010 or 68020 CPU. The possible release date could have been 1988-1989.
Basic description.
Information for this new chipset remains sketchy. However, the sound system may have still been the same as the Original chipset. According to RJ Mical, the new chipset kept the original 13 bit DAC for its CLUT but with quadrupled color registers from 32 to 128. The color palette would have remained at 4096 colours but the resolution could go up to 1024×1024 with 128 colors (7 bit color depth), additionally the chipset can address up to of Chip RAM space.
Ranger used 2MB VRAM as chip memory. In an interview, Jay Miner described benefits of using VRAM instead of DRAM; this gave the display system enough memory bandwidth for 1024×1024 displays. From the known specification, it could be said that Ranger chipset was designed to compete with Sharp's X68000 personal computers (released in 1987) which takes advantage of VRAM technology for displaying a 1024×1024 screens in 16 colors.
Unreleased chipset.
Jay Miner made sure that the Ranger chipset was completed and fully tested before he left Commodore in hope that one day Commodore would release it. It is unclear if a prototype of a Ranger system still exists today. But at that time, VRAM was considered expensive compared to DRAM, so Commodore refused to release Ranger for its high price which was unsuitable for the low-end systems like A500 to cover its costs.
In a few years, VRAM costs dropped to be only 20% more than DRAM, so Commodore planned to use VRAM in the AAA chipset which was not released due to Commodore canceling it due to its still high cost for low-end systems.
Ranger's legends and myths.
Some thoughts of a built-in blitter per playfield designed in Ranger had been rejected by Dave Haynie. However, a post on Team Amiga explained the Ranger idea:

Somaliland constitutional referendum, 2001

The 2001 Somaliland constitutional referendum took place on 31 May 2001 in the internationally unrecognised Republic of Somaliland. The referendum was held on a draft constitution that affirmed Somalialand's independence from Somalia as a separate state. Two-thirds of eligible voters took part in the referendum and 97.1% of them voted in favour of the constitution. However the referendum was opposed by the government of Somalia and did not lead to any state recognising the independence of Somaliland.
Background.
In May 1991 after the fall of the military dictator of Somalia, Siad Barre, the Somali National Movement declared the independence of Somaliland. In 1993 an executive presidency was set up with a bicameral legislature and Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal was elected president by a council of elders. In 1997, at a Conference of Somaliland Communities in Hargeisa, a constitution was adopted to last for 3 years until a referendum could take place to bring it into full effect. The constitution was amended in 2000 and the referendum was delayed by one year till 2001. Meanwhile the attempts to form a national government of Somalia and the formation of the Transitional National Government of Somalia in May 2000 encouraged Somaliland to hold a referendum to try to show Somaliland's desire for independence.
Referendum.
The referendum in effect became a vote on the independence of Somaliland due to the inclusion in the constitution of a clause on Somaliland's independence. There was no census or voter lists so community elders decided who was eligible to vote in the referendum.
The Transitional Federal Government of Somalia opposed the referendum, describing it as illegal and said that the government of Somaliland had no authority to unilaterally separate from Somalia. The referendum was also opposed by the leadership of the neighbouring region of Puntland as provocative. No international organisation or country supported the referendum.
A team of ten observers from the Initiative and Referendum Institute observed the referendum. They were only able to visit 57 of the 600 polling stations and avoided the Sool region due to security concerns. However they reported that the referendum was open, fair, peaceful and any fraud was rare and insignificant.
Results.
About two-thirds of voters took part in the referendum and 97.1% of them voted in favour of the constitution. The international observers agreed that those who did not vote were most likely opposing the referendum, with only 31% turnout in the Las Anod district where there was the most opposition to the constitution.
Aftermath.
The President of Somaliland, Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal, described the referendum as having made Somaliland into a nation and put an end to any question of reuniting with Somalia. However despite the support for independence demonstrated in the referendum, no nation has recognised the independence of Somaliland since then, due to fears over ever increasing numbers of unsustainable small states and the African Union's opposition to the splitting of existing states.

University of Missouri School of Law

University of Missouri School of Law (Mizzou Law or MU Law) is the law school of the University of Missouri, a state university in the U.S. State of Missouri. It is located on the university's main campus in Columbia, forty minutes from the Missouri State Capitol and Supreme Court in Jefferson City. The school was founded in 1872 by the Curators of the University of Missouri, making it one of the oldest law schools west of the Mississippi River. Its alumni include governors, legislators, judges, attorneys general, and law professors across the country. in Alternative Dispute Resolution, having founded the nation’s first center dedicated to the study of settling disputes beyond litigation. This center, the Center for the Study of Dispute Resolution (CSDR) is Mizzou Law’s only research center. The School also offers a Certificate in Dispute Resolution to its J.D. candidates, and a LL.M. for those who have already completed law school. The School discontinued its certificates in tax law and intellectual property law in 2004 because it lacked the faculty to teach those classes.
The median LSAT score for the incoming class of 2007 was 159, with a median GPA of 3.53. It accepted 35.8% of its applicants. Its student body total was 449 during the 2007-2008 school year. The law school also has a historical bar passage rate around 90.8%, which is higher than the Missouri state average of 86%. At graduation, roughly half of its students have secured employment for after the bar; 9 months after graduation around 95% of all students are employed.
Degree Programs.
J.D. Degree.
Additionally, all students must attend several presentations beyond their regular classes. These presentations qualify for “Professional Perspectives” or “Career Perspectives” credit, depending on the nature of the lecture and whether the Dean’s office or the Office of Career Development sponsors the presentation. These presentations are usually hosted by student organizations.
Students also must complete a “Writing Requirement,” in which the student conducts original research and drafts a paper on that issue. The paper must be approved by a member of the faculty who then edits and suggests changes and improvements. The student may only receive his or her writing credit after rewriting the paper, following the faculty comments. Students who participate in one of the school’s law reviews may apply their work for the law review towards the writing requirement.
LL.M. in Dispute Resolution.
The LL.M. in Dispute Resolution program at University of Missouri School of Law is offered by the Center for the Study of Dispute Resolution. The University of Missouri School of Law is the first law school in United States to offer an LL.M. that is exclusively focused on Dispute Resolution, and consistently ranks as one of the top law schools offering Dispute Resolution programs in the United States. Students who already have a law degree (either a J.D. from an ABA-accredited law school, or a LL.B. from a school outside the United States) may receive their LL.M. in Dispute Resolution from the University of Missouri. Students must complete 24 credit hours, 15 of which must be in Dispute Resolution. These 15 hours include the 16 hours that students earn from required coursework in Arbitration, Research, Methods for Evaluating Dispute Resolution Systems, Non-Binding Dispute Resolution, and Understanding Conflict.
Dual Degrees.
Mizzou Law has ten dual degree programs with other schools at the University of Missouri. These programs lay out which courses students may count towards their law degree in addition to their non-law degree. These programs are:
Academic programs.
Certificates.
The School of Law also has affiliations with other schools and programs at the university, whereby the student earns a certificate from another school:
Clinics & Externships.
Mizzou Law operates five clinics:
Students may also perform an externship for up to 3 hours of credit. Externships are only permitted in public law offices, government offices, and not-for-profit offices. Students extern in places in Columbia and Jefferson City, such as the Missouri Department of Revenue, the Secretary of State’s Office, the Missouri Department of Mental Health, and the Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations.
Study Abroad.
The University of Missouri accepts credits earned from all ABA-approved law schools and study abroad programs. It also runs its own study abroad programs.
Journals.
The Editors-in-Chief and other editors blind-grade the assignments. Law school administrative assistants rank each student three times: first, by weighting the applicants' GPAs at 80% and their written submissions 20%; then, by weighting the GPAs at 20% and the written submissions at 80%; lastly, by ranking solely based on the scores of the written submissions. The editors-in-chief then select which applicants they want. The Missouri Law Review selects first based on the 80/20 rankings, then the "Journal of Dispute Resolution", then the "Missouri Law & Policy Review". Then, they pick again in order, this time based on the 20/80 rankings, and finally they select based on the 0/100 rankings.
"Missouri Law Review".
The "Missouri Law Review" is the law school's oldest and most prestigious law review. It is entirely student-run and student-edited and publishes four times a year. It has been cited over fourteen hundred times in published court opinions, including the Supreme Court of the United States, since 1936, when publication began.
Each spring the law review hosts a symposium on a different part of the law. Noted scholars and practitioners in the given area give a presentation, and then they write an article which the law review publishes later that year. Recent topics have included:
"Journal of Dispute Resolution".
The "Journal of Dispute Resolution", operated by the Center for the Study of Dispute Resolution, is entirely student-led and student-edited. Published semi-annually, the Journal is considered the leading publication in alternative dispute resolution.
The Journal, like the "Missouri Law Review", hosts annual symposia in the area of dispute resolution. Past symposia have included:
"Missouri Environmental Law & Policy Review".
The "Missouri Environmental Law & Policy Review", or MELPR (pronounced "mel-per"), is a joint venture between the School of Law and the Missouri Bar Association. Founded in 1993, MELPR is the school's youngest law review, consisting of 11 student editors and no more than 20 student associates. From its inception in 1993 to the 2010-2011 school year, it published three editions each year. Beginning in the 2011-2012 school year, two issues per year are planned, one each in the fall and spring. MELPR publishes case notes and articles on topics including energy policy, land use, water policy, agricultural law, land reclamation, and environmental sustainability.

Mel Lindquist

Mel Lindquist (born Melvin Benjamin Lindquist, July 5, 1911 – November 24, 2000) was an engineer and renowned pioneer of the American Studio Wood Turning movement. Foundational to the studio woodturning movement, Mel Lindquist applied his master machinist techniques and background in engineering, pioneering hollowing techniques called "blind boring", or "blind turning", widely used today. Mel Lindquist discovered spalted wood on his land in the upstate New York Adirondacks in the 1950s and together with his son Mark Lindquist, popularized its use as a material for woodturning and woodworking. Mel Lindquist is widely credited as being the first to seriously explore the use of spalted wood for wood turning, and his son Mark wrote groundbreaking essays in journals of the 1970s. The effect was widespread according to Fine Woodworking: "...Melvin and Mark Lindquist unleashed spalted wood upon the world..." In addition to his numerous technical innovations, Mel Lindquist is also widely credited for developing an aesthetic foundation for the studio woodturning movement based on translating ancient ceramic ideals into the medium of wood, incorporating bark inclusions and imperfections as decorative elements within the turning integral to design. In 1981, Mel and his son Mark initiated the wood turning program at the Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts,TN, and in October 1985, Mel won the first award honoring the pillars of the studio woodturning movement at the national conference: "Woodturning: Vision and Concept" at Arrowmont School, TN.
Lindquist signed his work with a simple script "L" including the date and type of wood from the early 1950s until 1980. After 1980 he signed his work with an incised script signature "Mel Lindquist" on the bottoms of his pieces.
Mel Lindquist's work can be found in numerous public and private collections in the US and abroad, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City, the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum, San Francisco, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington D.C., the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, TX, and the White House Collection of American Crafts.

New York City Police Department corruption and misconduct

Various scandals and allegations of the New York City Police Department have occurred throughout the department's history, some involving police misconduct.
Knapp Commission.
In 1971, police officer Frank Serpico, Lt. David Durk, and other officers, testified before the Knapp Commission about the corruption they witnessed in the department. The Commission's findings led to reforms within the department, developed by Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy. Reforms included decentralizing corruption control, within Field Investigative Units, which were intended to be closer and more in touch with the streets where the problems were. There have been other commissions investigating the NYPD before and after the Knapp Commission, including 1994's Mollen Commission, which documented widespread police abuse during the late 1980s and early 1990s .
Incidents.
Incidents involving allegations of police misconduct within the NYPD:
Frank Lino arrest.
In 1962, the Bonanno crime family mobster Frank Lino was arrested for his alleged involvement in the shootings of two Brooklyn police detectives. The detectives, aged 28 and 56, were shot dead during a holdup of a tobacco store in Gravesend, Brooklyn, where Lino and two others netted $5,000. Lino was charged with the murders after supplying a getaway vehicle for one of the "stick-up men" so that he could then flee to Chicago. Lino was one of the five men charged after being taken to the 66th Precinct for an interrogation. During Lino's interrogation, he claimed that police officers drove staples into his hands and a broomstick up his rectum. He alleged that the abuse resulted in a broken leg and arm. Lino was later released with three years probation after he threatened to sue the city for police brutality. He also claimed that the uncontrollable blinking of his eyes was a direct result of the alleged beating.
Clifford Glover shooting.
On April 28, 1973, Officer Thomas Shea shot 10-year old Clifford Glover while in Queens' South Jamaica district, thinking Clifford had a gun. On June 12, 1974, Shea was acquitted
of wrongdoing by 11 white and one black juror but was fired from the NYPD that year.
Randolph Evans shooting.
On Thanksgiving Day (November 25), 1976, Officer Robert Torsney shot Randolph Evans to death while responding to a call at Evans's Brooklyn housing project home. Torsney was found not guilty by insanity defense (Automatism of Penfield epilepsy) and was committed to a psychiatric hospital in Brooklyn until December 20, 1978 when state reviewers declared him no longer a threat to himself or society and released him.
Michael Stewart chokehold.
On September 15, 1983, Michael Jerome Stewart was arrested for spray painting graffiti on a wall of Manhattan's First Avenue station. He was violent with the officers, ran to the street and became unconscious and died on September 28, 1983. In October 1983, the case went before a grand jury in Manhattan, but was dismissed 7 months later because one of the jurors started private investigations on the case. In February 1984, a second grand jury indicted three officers with criminally negligent homicide, assault and perjury, while three other officers were charged with perjury and jury selection started in June 1985. On November 24, 1985, all six of the indicted officers were acquitted by a jury. In 1987, the eleven involved officers and the MTA were sued for $40 million. In August 1990, Michael's parents and siblings settled out of court for $1.7 million.
Eleanor Bumpurs shooting.
On October 29, 1984, Bumpurs used a knife against NYPD officers when she was being evicted
from her Bronx apartment for non-payment of her rent and as psychotic. Stephen Sullivan
fired two shots from his 12-gauge single barreled shotgun, sending one pellet into Eleanor's hand and nine other pellets into her chest, killing her. Sullivan was tried and acquitted in 1987. In 1990, the city ended the legal proceedings by agreeing to pay $200,000 to Bumpurs family estate.
Mark Davidson stun gun incident.
On April 17, 1985, Mark Davidson was arrested by undercover detectives on charges of drug dealing and taken to NYPD's 106th precinct in Queens's Ozone Park, where he was beaten and tortured with a stun gun and threatened with torture on his genitals into making a false confession. On May 3, 1986, Sgt. Richard Pike, Jeffrey Gilbert and Loren MacLary were each convicted of assault and were sentenced to four to six years.
Edmund Perry shooting.
On June 12, 1985, Edmund Perry returned to the city after graduating from Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire when Edmund and his brother, Jonah, were walking in Morningside Park where they encountered Lee Van Houten, an undercover plainclothes detective on auto burglary patrol. Edmund tried to rob Van Houten by grabbing his neck and Van Houten fell to the ground and fired three shots, at least one in Edmund's stomach, killing him immediately. About 23 witnesses supported Van Houten's version of the incident, resulting in his acquittal.
Tompkins Square Park Riot.
In August 1988, a riot erupted in Alphabet City's Tompkins Square Park in the East Village of Manhattan when police attempted to enforce a newly passed curfew for the park. Bystanders, artists, residents, homeless people and political activists clashed with police on the night of August 6 and the early morning of the following day. In a report released by Commissioner Benjamin Ward, the police department's actions were "not well planned, staffed, supervised or executed... which culminated in a riot."
Anthony Baez death.
On December 22, 1994, 29-year old Anthony Baez was choked to death by police officer Francis X. Livoti in the University Heights section of the Bronx. In 1998, Livoti was convicted of violating Baez' civil rights, and two other officers were convicted of lying on the witness stand at Livoti's trial.
Abner Louima sodomy.
On August 9, 1997, Police Officer Justin Volpe in Brooklyn sodomized Abner Louima with a broken broom handle in the 70th Precinct bathroom. Officer Volpe eventually pled guilty and received a sentence of 30 years in federal prison. Other officers were also implicated and convicted on charges stemming from the initial cover-up.
Amadou Diallo death.
On February 4, 1999, four plainclothes NYPD officers working under the Street Crimes Unit fired 41 gunshots at Amadou Diallo, killing him instantly. Diallo, whom the officers mistook for a since-convicted rapist, was later found to be unarmed. The officers were subsequently acquitted, but the City of New York and the NYPD later paid out US$3,000,000 to Diallo's parents in a civil suit. Following the controversy, the Street Crimes Unit was abolished three years later.
Patrick Dorismond.
On March 16, 2000, Dorismond was approached by undercover officer Anthony Vasquez, who asked Dorismond how he and his partners could buy marijuanna. When Dorismond refused, a struggle occurred and Vasquez shot the unarmed Dorismond to death. Much of the
resulting controversy was about releasing Dorismond's sealed juvenile record to the media, claiming a person's right to privacy no longer existed once such persons die. Vasquez was never indicted by a grand jury for Dorismond's death.
Ousmane Zongo death.
On May 22, 2003, 43-year old Ousmane Zongo, an immigrant from Burkina Faso, was shot four times by Police Officer Bryan Conroy in a Chelsea warehouse. In 2005, Conroy was found guilty of criminally negligent homicide and sentenced to 5 years probation. In 2006, the city awarded the Zongo family $3 million to settle a wrongful death suit.
Mafia cops.
Louis Eppolito and Steven Caracappa who, while on the payroll of the NYPD, were also on the payroll of the Lucchese crime family and were abusing their authority as officers of the NYPD. They would routinely violate the civil rights of the citizens of New York City, and moonlighted for the crime family. They would use NYPD files to track down the enemies of the crime family and were ultimately convicted of the murders of Eddie Lino, Michael Greenwald (an informant for the FBI) and innocent man Nick Guido who had the same name as a man targeted by the crime family. Eppolito received life in prison with an additional 100 years and Caracappa received life in prison with an additional 80 years. They were also fined a combined $4 million. They received a monthly salary of $5000 from the crime family.
Timothy Stansbury death.
On January 24, 2004, Housing Bureau officer Richard Neri, Jr., accidentally shot to death Timothy Stansbury, a 19-year-old black man who was trespassing on the roof landing of a Bedford-Stuyvesant housing project. Stansbury was unarmed but had apparently startled Neri upon opening the roof door coming upon the officer. At that point, Neri discharged his service firearm and mortally wounded Stansbury. Although Commissioner Kelly stated that the shooting appeared "unjustified", a Brooklyn jury found that no criminal act occurred and that the event was a tragic accident. Neri was thus cleared of all charges. The city later agreed to pay $2 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the Stansbury family. A grand jury declined to indict Neri but Kelly later suspended him for 30 days without pay and permanently stripped him of his weapon.
Flushing brothels.
Dennis Kim and Jerry Svoronos, two New York City Police Officers working out of the 109th Precinct, Gina Kim and Geeho Chae, brothel operators, were arrested on March 8, 2006, for bribery charges relating to the protection of a brothel located in Flushing, Queens. Agents seized approximately $800,000 in cash, believed to be the proceeds of the brothel, from Kim and Chae's vehicle and residence. On March 8, 2006 search warrants were executed at the brothel and a boarding house used by the brothel workers, and agents seized immigration documents, business records, and a small quantity of ecstasy. The two officers were in a unit which targets quality-of-life-type crimes. Members of the precincts engaged in a practice known as "flaking", in which cops planted marijuana, cocaine, or Ecstasy on suspects. Members of the conditions unit maintained a small stash of drug in an Altoids tin for this purpose, Assistant U.S. Attorney Monica Ryan said. In addition, 16 Chinese and Korean brothel workers were taken into immigration custody.
Sean Bell shooting incident.
On November 25, 2006, plainclothes police officers shot and killed Sean Bell and wounded two of his companions, one critically, outside of the Kalua Cabaret in Queens. No weapon was recovered. According to the police, Bell rammed his vehicle into an undercover officer and hit an unmarked NYPD minivan twice, prompting undercover officers to fire fifty rounds into Bell's car. A bullet piercing the nearby AirTrain JFK facility startled two Port Authority patrolmen stationed there. An undercover officer claims he heard one of the unarmed man's companions threaten to get his gun to settle a fight with another individual. Civil case resumes May 6, 2010. On April 25, 2008, Justice Arthur Cooperman cleared Detectives Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora of murder charges and Detective Marc Cooper of reckless endangerment in the death of Sean Bell.
Kidnapping of drug dealer.
On October 29, 2008, officer Jorge Arbaje-Diaz pled not guilty in Brooklyn Federal Court to charges that he kidnapped, robbed, and tortured drug dealers for more than 1,600 pounds (730 kg) of cocaine and $4 million in cash.
NYPD subway sodomy scandal.
On October 15, 2008, five officers attempted to arrest Michael Mineo for smoking marijuana in a Brooklyn subway station. Days later, Mineo made accusations claiming he was sodomized with a police radio antenna by the officers. On December 9, 2008, the Brooklyn District Attorney announced that three of the officers, Richard Kern, Alex Cruz, and Andrew Morales, were indicted on criminal charges. According to the District Attorney, officer Kern sodomized Mineo with his expandable baton after the officers handcuffed him. Officer Kern was charged with aggravated sexual abuse and assault, and faced up to 25 years in prison, and officers Cruz and Morales were charged with hindering prosecution and official misconduct, and faced up to 4 years in prison. All three officers were acquitted of all charges.
Retaliation against Adrian Schoolcraft.
In May 2010, Adrian Schoolcraft, a former NYPD officer, publicized recordings he made in secret while on duty, showing a pattern of corruption and retaliation against him for refusing to cooperate. Officers detained citizens without charges to meet quota and failed to report serious crimes, including rape, to make their department appear to be reducing crime rates. When the NYPD learned that Schoolcraft was privately investigating such corruption, concern for his mental health was used as an excuse for armed officers to kidnap and imprison him in a hospital. As of 2010 he was suspended without pay and was filing suit against the NYPD.
Asthma death incident.
In August 2010, 11-year-old Briana Ojeda died from an asthma attack after an NYPD officer denied her mother's pleas to perform CPR. Ojeda's mother allegedly was driving her daughter to the hospital when she took a wrong one-way turn in a neighborhood street and stopped to ask Officer Alfonso Mendez for help. Ojeda's mother claimed Mendez smirked at her and said, "I don't know CPR." and tried to ticket her. A bystander performed CPR and by the time an ambulance arrived, Mendez had left. After a one week manhunt, Mendez was identified and has been suspended without pay indefinitely.
NYPD "rape cops" scandal.
In December 2008, two on-duty NYPD officers were charged with raping a woman whom they had been dispatched to help on a 911 call. Officers Kenneth Moreno, age 43, and Franklin Mata, age 29, were called to help a drunken woman climb out of a taxi and into her apartment in 2008. The woman testified that she awoke in her bedroom to being raped by Moreno; Mata was said to have acted as a lookout during the incident. Although both men were acquitted of the rape at trial in May 2011, the jury's verdict proved highly controversial and drew large protests. Moreno and Mata were, however, found guilty of official misconduct for going back into the woman's apartment three times without alerting their superiors and making erroneous calls to 911 with claims of a nonexistent homeless man loitering in the area, to facilitate their return to the premises. As a result of the convictions, both officers were immediately terminated from the NYPD.
In September 2011, an off-duty NYPD officer, Michael Pena, was charged with raping a schoolteacher at gunpoint. According to the woman, she was stopped by Pena, who was allegedly intoxicated, and ordered her into an apartment backyard as he pointed a gun into her face. At Pena's trial, the woman tesitifed that Pena had threatened to kill her if she screamed or looked at him as he began to rape her. An apartment resident heard the woman's pleas for him to stop and called 911. The NYPD was able to confirm that Pena was drunk and armed, but he denies raping her. He was charged with 10 felonies, including predatory assault, sexual assault, and first-degree rape, and pled not guilty. On March 27, 2012, Pena was found guilty on the predatory assault and sexual assault charges, but the jury deadlocked on the rape charges. Three months after the trial, Pena plead guilty to rape and was sentenced to 75-to-life.
2011 ticket fixing scandal.
In October 2011, 16 NYPD police officers were charged with offenses related to ticket fixing.
Paid Detail Unit.
An October 2011 article by Pam Martens in the Counterpunch newsletter, alleged police corruption in reference to the NYPD's Paid Detail Unit that allows corporations to hire NYPD police officers for security duties. The Paid Detail Unit was established by Mayor Giuliani 1998 as a way to increase revenue to New York city that allowed off-duty police officers to moonlight in uniform and as of 2003 nearly half of NYPD's street cops (11,000) were on the Paid Detail Unit. The then commanding officer of the Unit justified the program by claiming cops are off the business payroll the moment they see a crime committed and are expected to respond just as they would if they were off-duty.
Muslim surveillance controversy.
When the Associated Press published reports on the NYPD's spying on Muslims in New York City and neighboring New Jersey, the NYPD faced much controversy and criticism. Muslims were spied on in mosques, restaurants, streets, public places and Muslim groups, and websites were scrutinized. It resulted in much confusion and anger from Muslim communities in the United States, as well as support from New York City mayor Bloomberg. The FBI criticized the spying as unhealthy. Associated Press won 2012 Pulitzer Prize for the investigation. Later, in June 2012, Muslims in New Jersey sued the NYPD over the spying. However, the lawsuit was dismissed in February 2014 by a federal judge who said that the surveillance of the Muslim community was a lawful effort to prevent terrorism, not a civil-rights violation. The surveillance program was disbanded on April 15, 2014 after a meeting that was held with several Muslim advocates on April 8, 2014. It was also revealed that the surveillance program failed to generate even a single lead.
Occupy Wall Street - Michael Premo case.
Occupy Wall Street activist Michael Premo was arrested on December 17, 2011 and charged with assaulting an officer. Prosecutors argued and the arresting officer gave sworn testimony that Premo "charged the police like a linebacker, taking out a lieutenant and resisting arrest so forcefully that he fractured an officer's bone."
The defense located video that was taken by freelancer Jon Gerberg which contradicted the sworn testimony, instead showing officers "tackling as he attempted to get back on his feet". Prosecutors claimed no video of Premo's arrest existed, yet the Gerberg video clearly showed an NYPD officer also filming Premo's arrest One author wrote that "information provided by the NYPD in the trial was fabricated to such a degree that the allegations made by the police officers have turned out to be quite literally the opposite of what actually happened.
In March 2013, Premo was acquitted of all charges.
Kyam Livingston death.
On July 21, 2013, 37-year-old Kyam Livingston died in NYPD custody after being arrested by officers of Brooklyn's 70th Precinct due to a verbal confrontation with her grandmother that police say was in violation of an order of protection. Upon arrest, Livingston was brought to Kings County Hospital for alcohol and drug testing but was released in a few hours. She was then processed at the precinct and brought to Brooklyn Central Booking to await arraignment. After approximately 13 hours in custody, Livingston experienced stomach pain and diarrhea and began to repeatedly request medical assistance over the course of seven more hours. According to witnesses, NYPD officers on duty refused to issue Livingston any medical attention, stating that she was an "alcoholic" and threatening to "lose the paperwork" of Livingston and other women in the cell who were pleading for someone to come to her aid. It was further reported that Livingston was dead for at least 20 minutes before emergency medical staff arrived.
Beginning in August 2013, there were repeated demonstrations in Brooklyn demanding the names of the officers on duty at the time of Livingston's death, the release of video surveillance tapes from the cell Livingston was detained in, and the full investigation and improvement of conditions at Brooklyn Central Booking jail. Livingston's family filed a Notice of Claim against the NYPD and other government entities as a prerequisite to an $11 million lawsuit, and called for the criminal prosecution of any police officer who denied medical attention to Livingston while she was in their custody. The NYPD Internal Affairs Division’s investigation of the matter is ongoing.
Alexian Lien beating.
The beating of Alexian Lien took place on September 29, 2013 on New York City's Henry Hudson Parkway in an altercation Lien and motorcyclists participating in a rally called "Hollywood's Block Party". One of the bikers pulled in front of Lien and slowed dramatically, an action sometimes referred to as "brake checking". Lien stopped his vehicle and was quickly surrounded by bikers. Lien accelerated to escape and struck one of the bikers, critically injuring him. A chase ensued, ending in Lien being pulled from his vehicle and beaten. The bikers included an off-duty New York City police officer. The attack was caught on video and garnered international attention. A number of bikers are facing assault and other criminal charges, and legislation has been proposed to regulate motorcycle rallies in New York City.
The NYPD faced criticism when some of the bikers involved in the chase and attack were identified as an off-duty New York City police officer. Ten-year veteran and undercover detective Wojciech Braszczok surrendered to authorities and was arrested on October 8. An undercover narcotics detective has been identified by the press as being present but not participating in the assault. Sources have reported a total of five off-duty officers were originally present on the West Side Highway, and that at least two saw the assault.
Rigging of evidence to secure convictions.
Retired detective Louis Scarcella and his colleague Stephen W. Chmil rigged evidence to promote their own careers which led to imprisonment of dozens of innocents. District Attorney Charles J. Hynes reopened the cases of 56 people arrested by Detective Scarcella; at least five cases of Detective Chmil’s (out of 300 deemed probably wrongful) scrutinized by nonprofit Exoneration Initiative made clear that he "invented confessions, coached witnesses and persuaded others to change their descriptions of perpetrators to match the suspect in custody — even in cases he worked without Detective Scarcella".
Examples:
The Legal Aid Society, which represents 20 of the people whose cases were reopened by the Brooklyn district attorney’s office, is concerned that the prosecutors’ review is too narrow, because it is limited to cases in which Detective Scarcella testified in court. 
“There are literally hundreds of cases that could be affected,” said Steven Banks, attorney-in-chief of the Legal Aid Society. “It stands to reason that these 50 are just the tip of the iceberg. There’s enough evidence that Scarcella may not have acted alone. A fair look would require a much broader inquiry.”
Three half-brothers, Alvena Jennette, Robert Hill and Darryl Austin, have had their murder convictions cleared by the Brooklyn DA in cases linked to Scarcella and Gomez in May 2014.

USS Charles (ID-1298)

USS "Charles" (ID-1298), briefly USS "Harvard" (ID-1298) in 1918 and 1920, was a troop transport that served in the United States Navy from 1918 to 1920.
Construction.
"Charles" was built in 1907 as the commercial passenger ship SS "Harvard" at Chester, Pennsylvania, by the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding and Engine Works.
Naval service.
The U.S. Navy commandeered her on 21 March 1918 for World War I service, assigned her the registry Identification Number (Id. No.) 1298, outfitted her for service as a troop transport at Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California, and commissioned her as USS "Harvard" (ID-1298) on 9 April 1918 with Lieutenant Commander M. F. Tarpey, USNRF, in command. On 11 April 1918 she was renamed USS "Charles" (ID-1298). The Navy later (on 28 August 1918) purchased "Charles" outright from her owners.
Departing Mare Island, "Charles" reached Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 26 June 1918. There she loaded troops and departed Newport News, Virginia, for Brest, France, on 10 July 1918. She arrived at Brest on 21 July 1918.
On 27 July 1918, "Charles" reported at Southampton, England, for duty as a ferry for troops crossing the English Channel. She made about 60 voyages between Southampton and Le Havre or Boulogne, France, carrying troops of all nationalities bound for action at the front during the war or for occupation duty after it ended, until 5 May 1919.
Her ferrying duties completed, "Charles" embarked passengers at Rotterdam in the Netherlands and at Brest for transportation to the United States, and on 15 June 1919, arrived at New York City. Her support of United States Army operations in Europe at an end, "Charles" arrived at the Philadelphia Navy Yard at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 24 July 1919, and was decommissioned there on 10 June 1920.
Return to civil use.
Reverting to her original name, "Charles" was renamed USS "Harvard" on 29 July 1920. She was considered for conversion into a seaplane tender, but this was never carried out, and instead she was sold on 14 October 1920.
Wreck.
Once again SS "Harvard", she resumed commercial service, during which she was stranded and wrecked at Point Arguello, California, on 30 May 1931.

<doc id="21553172" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21553172" title="Sinus Sabaeus quadrangle">
Sinus Sabaeus quadrangle

The Sinus Sabaeus quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. It is also referred to as MC-20 (Mars Chart-20).
The Sinus Sabaeus quadrangle covers the area from 315° to 360° west longitude and 0° to 30° degrees south latitude on Mars. It contains Schiaparelli, a large, easily visible crater that sits close to the equator.
Layers.
Wislicenus Crater and the Schiaparelli basin crater contains layers, also called strata. Many places on Mars show rocks arranged in layers. Sometimes the layers are of different colors. Light-toned rocks on Mars have been associated with hydrated minerals like sulfates. The Mars Rover Opportunity examined such layers close-up with several instruments. Some layers are probably made up of fine particles because they seem to break up into fine dust. Other layers break up into large boulders so they are probably much harder. Basalt, a volcanic rock, is thought to in the layers that form boulders. Basalt has been identified on Mars in many places. Instruments on orbiting spacecraft have detected clay (also called phyllosilicates) in some layers. Scientists are excited about finding hydrated minerals such as sulfates and clays on Mars because they are usually formed in the presence of water. Places that contain clays and/or other hydrated minerals would be good places to look for evidence of life. 
Rock can form layers in a variety of ways. Volcanoes, wind, or water can produce layers. 
Craters.
When a comet or asteroid collides at a high rate of speed interplanetary with the surface of Mars it creates a primary impact crater. The primary impact may also eject significant numbers of rocks which eventually fall back to make secondary craters. The secondary craters may be arranged in clusters. All of the craters in the cluster would appear to be equally eroded; indicating that they would all are of the same age. If these secondary craters formed from a single, large, nearby impact, then they would have formed at roughly the same instant in time. The image below of Dennin Crater shows a cluster of secondary craters.
White rock in Pollack crater.
Within the region is Pollack crater, which has light-toned rock deposits. Mars has an old surface compared to Earth. While much of Earth's land surface is just a few hundred million years old, large areas of Mars are billions of years old. Some surface areas have been formed, eroded away, then covered over with new layers of rocks. The Mariner 9 spacecraft in the 1970s photographed a feature that was called "White Rock.". Newer images revealed that the rock is not really white, but that the area close by is so dark that the white rock looks really white. It was thought that this feature could have been a salt deposit, but information from the instruments on Mars Global Surveyor demonstrated rather that it was probably volcanic ash or dust. Today, it is believed that White Rock represents an old rock layer that once filled the whole crater that it's in, but today it has since been mostly eroded away. The picture below shows white rock with a spot of the same rock some distance from the main deposit, so it is thought that the white material once covered a far larger area.

<doc id="21553181" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21553181" title="Shia view of Aisha">
Shia view of Aisha

The Shi'a view of Aisha is generally unfavourable. This is primarily due to what they see as her contempt for the Ahl al-Bayt (the Islamic prophet Muhammad's family) and her attempts to stir up the fitnah (civil war) of the time. Her participation in the Battle of Jamal is widely considered her most significant sign of such contempt. They also do not believe that she conducted herself in an appropriate manner in her role as Muhammad's wife.
Shi'a also consider Aisha to be a controversial figure because of her political involvement during her lifetime. Aisha came from a political family lineage, as she was the daughter of caliph Abu Bakr. Aisha also played an active role in Muhammad’s political life; she was known to accompany him to wars, where she learned military skills, such as initiating pre-war negotiations between combatants, conducting battles, and ending wars.
Lawfulness of criticism.
Sunnis assert that because Aisha is the wife of Muhammad, criticizing her is tantamount to criticizing him. The Shi'a counter this by referring to the situation of both Nuh and Lut's wives told in the Qur'an:
Ismail ibn Kathir, a renowned commentator on the Qur'an
, said on this verse: ""Therefore, all the intimate knowledge of their husbands neither helped them nor prevented punishment, hence Allah's statement, (So, they availed them not against Allah) means, because their wives were disbelievers""
Wife of Muhammad.
Status as favorite wife.
Some Shias reject the idea that Aisha was Muhammad's favorite wife and believe that Muhammad favored none of his wives in compliance with the Qur'anic verse:
They also quote Muhammad: ""When a man has two wives and he is inclined to one of them, he will come on the Day of resurrection with a side hanging down.""
Others believe that Umm Salama was his favorite wife due to her dedication to the ahl al-bayt. Umm Salama is presented as a contrast to Aisha through her loyalty to Muhammad's family as well as obedience to his commands after his death. Unlike Aisha, who raised an army against Ali, Umm Salama tried to calm tensions. She also warned Ali of Aisha's intentions when dissuading Aisha from rebellion was unsuccessful. 
It is generally accepted by Sunnis and Shias that Khadija was Muhammad's favorite wife without contest, and that Aisha or Umm Salama were only the favorite of his later wives. Some use the fact that Muhammad was only in a monogamous relationship with Khadija as evidence of her superiority to his later wives. One opinion is that Muhammad's marriage to Aisha was only prescribed to ease his suffering after Khadija's death, diminishing the implications of divine intent for the union.
Mohammed's love and gratitude for Khatija was so great that Aisha would become jealous. One time, Khatija's sister Hala whose voice sounded exactly like Khatijas came to visit the Mohammed. as soon as he heard the familiar voice, he said "It must be Hala, her voice is just like that of Khatija." At this, Aisha burst forth "How is it that you always think of that old women who is no more living when Allah has given you much better wives." Mohammed replied, "Never better". On another occasion, he said: "Aisha! Khatija's love was given to me by Allah; never did Allah give me a better wife than Khatija."
Character.
The Shi'a reject the general Sunni belief that Aisha was the best woman of her time. All Shi'as (and some Sunnis) uphold that Fatimah, Muhammad's daughter and wife of Ali ibn Abi Talib's the greatest women ever whilst Shi'as also uphold her as infallible. Shia consider Fatima's ideal of the innocent and long-suffering as the counterpart to the sexual and political misdemeanors of which they accuse Aisha. Fatima is described as an exemplary wife, daughter, and mother and the only woman of the Fourteen Perfect of Pure Ones in Shia tradition. They cite the following hadith:
Ahmad ibn Hanbal records:
"Anas narrated that the prophet (s) said: "The most excellent of the women of all worlds are: Maryam the daughter of al-Imran, Khadijah the daughter of Khuwaylid, Fatimah the daughter of Muhammad, and Asiyah the wife of Pharaoh""
Although Sunnis attribute hundreds of hadith to Aisha, Shias do not consider her a reputable source of hadith. She is deemed an untrustworthy and unreliable source because of her partisanship. Instead, Fatima and Ali are considered the best sources of hadith and are included as authoritative sources by both Shias and Sunnis. However, Aisha is used in certain hadith to serve as an example of how proper women should not behave.
Her character is further questioned by her dislike of Ali. According to some there is a hadith detailing Ali's conversation with a woman who secretly hates him. Through their conversation it is revealed that only a person with a serious moral defect has the capacity to hate Ali, and that this hatred is the physical manifestation of the moral defect. Unfortunately, finding an exact translation of this hadith in English was impossible, though a summary of the story can be found in Maria Dakake's "The Charismatic Community". This story implies that Aisha's hatred of Ali indicates a problem with her morals.
Jealousy.
Shia believe that Aisha was jealous of Muhammad's other wives, especially his first wife- Khadijah. On one occasion she is reported to have been tired of Muhammad speaking of his first wife so often and said that Allah had replaced Khadija with a better wife, referring to herself, for which Muhammad rebuked her. She is also criticized for deceiving Muhammad and hatching a plan with Hafsa bint Umar to stop him spending a long time at Zaynab bint Jahsh's house. They believe this shows a severe amount of disrespect and insubordination to her husband. The following verses of the Qur'an are unanimously agreed by scholars to be referring to Aisha and Hafsa:
The Shi'a website Answering-Ansar.org comments on this verse:
""Some Ahl al-Sunnah assert that since Aisha was the most superior wife then that means that she was the most superior of all women. Not only is the claim that she was the most superior wife baseless, the fact of the matter is in Surah Tahrim, Allah(swt) also states this:" 
""Perhaps if he divorces you, his Lord will give him wives who are better than you, who submit and believe” (Qur'an 66:5)- this clearly indicates that there were believing women among the Muslims who were much better than Aisha.""
Another example of Aisha's jealousy is found in a story regarding Safiyyah, another of Muhammad's wives. Aisha is reported to have mocked Safiyyah's jewish heritage, which invoked Muhammad's defense of Safiyyah. He reminded Aisha that while Safiyyah's people descended from prophets, Aisha's ancestors had no special status.
Aisha is also reported to have slandered against Muhammad's concubine, Maryam the Copt, and spread rumors questioning her chastity. Shias believe that Maryam was cleared of these charges in the verse many Sunnis claim exonerates Aisha of charges of adultery.
One hadith attributed to Ali, the fourth caliph, condemns jealousy in all women.
""Jealousy in women is unpardonable, but in a man it is a sign of his faith in religion.""
Muhammad's wives held a higher place in society than other women according to verse 33:32 of the Qur'an
"O ye wives of the Prophet! Ye are not like any other women. If ye keep your duty (to Allah), then be not soft of speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease aspire (to you), but utter customary speech."
and so were more accountable for their faults like jealousy.
Resentment towards Ali.
The negative Shi'a view of Aisha largely stems from Aisha’s resentment towards Ali and the Ahl al-bayt in general. The Alh al-bayt is defined by Shi'as as Muhammad, his daughter Fatima, her husband Ali, and their two sons Hasan and Husayn. They do not include Muhammad's wives in this category.
Aisha's feelings towards Ali developed when she was accused of adultery. Muhammad took Aisha on a campaign against a Bedouin tribe when she was thirteen years old. Aisha noticed she lost her necklace during a caravan rest stop and retraced her steps to find the piece of jewelry. When she returned, Aisha realized she was mistakenly left behind. Aisha returned to Medina escorted on a camel by a young man, which quickly led to gossip and speculation. Muhammad was deeply affected by this occurrence and turned to others for advice. The harshest opinion came from Muhammad's cousin Ali who said, “There are women enough, you could make another her successor” and he suggested that Muhammad divorce Aisha. Aisha never forgave Ali for that statement, which caused the deep resentment towards Ali that continued when he tried to become Muhammad’s successor. Although Sunnis believe that Allah revealed Aisha's innocence in the following verse
"Lo! they who spread the slander are a gang among you. Deem it not a bad thing for you; nay, it is good for you. Unto every man of them (will be paid) that which he hath earned of the sin; and as for him among them who had the greater share therein, his will be an awful doom. "
Shias believe that this verse was about Maryam the Copt instead of Aisha, and so the charge against her has never been cleared.
Shi'a supported the advancement of Ali in the political world and disregarded Aisha because of her feelings towards Ali. The Shi'a preferred Ali over the first three caliphs; they never accepted Mu’awiya or any later caliphs, and Shi'a took the name shi’at Ali, or Ali’s Party. Shi'a also regarded Ali to be the most judicious of the Companions. The early Shi'a deemed Ali and his descendents to have rights to leadership based on their relationship to Muhammad, their designation by Muhammad as his successors, along with their knowledge and religious insight.
Role in Fitnah.
Overview.
The biggest criticism that the Shi'a have of Aisha was her role in the First Fitnah" (First Islamic civil war)". The Shi'a view her (and all) opposition to Ali's Khalifat as a sinful act. 
The Shi'a website Answering-Ansar.org poses the question:
" 'If rejecting a Rightly Guided Khalifah is tantamount to apostasy and rebelling against any Khalifah even Yazid ibn Mu'awiyah will lead to such persons being raised as betrayers in the next world; what of those individuals who rebelled and fought the fourth rightly guided Khalifah? "
"This was the verdict of Abdullah Ibn Umar in his defence of Yazid (See Sahih al Bukhari, Arabic- English,Volume 9, Number 127)' "
Uthman's death.
The Shi'a believe that Aisha was a key player in the rebellion against 'Uthman ibn 'Affan, the third Khalifah. They quote her naming 'Uthman a "nathal" who should be killed, from numerous sources. They claim her motive was to install her inlaw, Talhah ibn Ubaydullah, as 'Uthman's successor. They also believe that only when the people turned to 'Ali ibn Abi Talib to become the Khalifah did Aisha change her stance and fight 'Ali to demand Qisas for Uthman. They cite some Sahabah and Tabi'in who highlighted her sudden shift in policy: 
""Ubayd bin Abi Salma who was a maternal relative of Aisha met her as she was making her way to Madinah. Ubayd said "Uthman has been killed and the people were without an Imam for eight days" to which Aisha asked "What did they do next?". Ubayd said "The people approached '‘Ali and gave him bayya". Aisha then said 'Take me back! Take me back to Makkah". She then turned her face towards Makkah and said, 'Verily Uthman was murdered innocently, and By Allah, I shall avenge his blood'. Ubayd then said 'You are now calling Uthman innocent, even though it was you who said 'Kill Nathal, this Jew"."
Battle of the Camel.
The Shi'a frown upon her role in the Battle of the Camel. The Battle of the Camel took place in Basra on December 4 656 CE. This battle is regarded as the first time Muslims, particularly Muslims who ranked among Muhammad’s sahaba, clashed and fought against one another in open warfare. The Battle of the Camel has been considered to be the first fitna and is also referred to as a “rebellion that leads to schism”, “violent factional strife”, or even “the temptation to turn upon one’s fellow Muslims”. The name of the battle reflects the centrality of Aisha’s role in the conflict, as she was seated on her camel in the middle of the battlefield. Aisha led a force of 13,000 soldiers against Ali after he failed to punish the murder of ‘Uthman. During the Battle of the Camel, Aisha mobilized military opposition with two male allies, Zubayr ibn al-Awam and Talhah, in order to challenge the legitimacy of ‘Ali. ‘Alis forces defeated their opponents; Talhah and Zubayr inb al-Awam were killed, and Aisha was sent home. 
Shi'a find this battle to be controversial because they believe that she launched her army on Ali out of her personal hatred towards him and his family. They use the following narration in their argument:
"“Aisha was informed about the opinion of the women, but there was some thing inside her boiling like a cooking pot against Ali”"
The Shi'a also usually refer to the Qur'anic verse:
They state that the verse clearly instructs Muhammad's wives to stay in their homes. They say that Aisha's role in the battle cleary transgresses Allah's commandment. The Shi'a also quote 'Ali ibn Abi Talib to back up their stance on this verse:
" 'He ('Ali) said: ‘Go to that woman and tell her to return to her home wherein Allah had ordered her to remain’. He (Ibn Abbas) said: ‘I therefore went to her and asked permission to enter, but she didn’t grant it. I therefore entered the house without her permission and sat on a cushion. She (Aisha) said: ‘O Ibn Abbas, by Allah I have never witnessed anyone like you! You entered our house without permission and sat on our cushion without our permission’. I said: ‘By Allah this is not your house, your only house is the one wherein Allah ordered you to remain, but you didn’t obey. The Commander of the Faithful orders you to return to that homeland from which you had left.' "
They also quote Shaykh Sibt Jauzi al-Hanafi, Shaykh Ibn Talha Shafiyi and Ibn Sabagh Maliki. Who all record that prior to the battle of Jamal:
""He Ali wrote a letter to Aisha: 'By leaving your home you have disobeyed Allah(swt) and his Rasul(messenger)""
They reject Aisha's reason for the battle that she was demanding Qisas for 'Uthman ibn 'Affan. They don't believe that it was her place to demand Qisas and assert that only the Imam"(Head of State)" can implement Shari'ah (including Qisas). 
The Shi'a website Answering-Ansar.org comments:
" 'What they fail to point out is the fact that Aisha's demands for Qisas i.e. that the killers of Uthman be handed over, was also contrary to the Sharia since Islamic penalties are implemented by the Head of State not the public, as and when they feel like it. Moreover Aisha was not the heir of Uthman to demand Qisas, he was survived by sons who were adult. It was their right to demand, but even if they did, that is all that they could do, they could NOT incite and rebel against Imam 'Ali (as) if they did not get their way, as Aisha did. You cannot hold the State to ransom, insisting that your demands are met through methods such as propaganda, incitement, and seizing control of administrative provinces.' "

International status and usage of the euro

The international status and usage of the :euro has grown since its launch in 1999. When the euro formally replaced 12 currencies on 1 January 2002, it inherited their use in territories such as Montenegro and replaced minor currencies tied to the pre-euro currencies, such as in Monaco. Four small states have been given a formal right to use the euro, and to mint their own coins, but all other usage has been unofficial outside the eurozone (the EU states who have adopted the euro). With or without an agreement these countries, unlike those in the eurozone, do not participate in the European Central Bank or the Euro Group.
Its international usage has also grown as a trading currency, acting as an economic or political alternative to using the United States dollar. Its increasing usage in this sense has led to its becoming the only significant challenger to the US dollar as the world's main reserve currency.
International adoption.
Sovereign states.
Several European microstates outside the EU have adopted the euro as their currency. For EU sanctioning of this adoption, a monetary agreement must be concluded. Prior to the launch of the euro, agreements were reached with Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City by EU member states (Italy in the case of San Marino and Vatican City, and France in the case of Monaco) allowing them to use and mint a limited amount of euro (with their own national symbols on the obverse side) to be valid throughout the Eurozone. However, they can not print banknotes. All of these states had previously had monetary agreements to use yielded eurozone currencies. The Vatican and San Marino had their currencies pegged to the Italian lira (Vatican and Sammarinese lira) and Monaco used the Monegasque franc, which was pegged to the French franc. Between 2010 and 2012, new agreements between the EU and Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City came into force.
A similar agreement was negotiated with Andorra and came into force on 1 April 2012. Andorra did not previously have an official currency. Prior to 2002, it used both the French franc and Spanish peseta as "de facto" legal tender currencies, though they never had an official monetary arrangement with either country, and switched to the euro (without any monetary agreement) when it was introduced on 1 January 2002. After years of negotiations, partially over concerns with banking secrecy, the EU and Andorra signed a monetary agreement on 30 June 2011 which made the euro the official currency in Andorra and allowed them to mint their own euro coins as early as 1 July 2013, provided they comply with the agreement's terms. In October 2012, Jordi Cinca, Andorra's Minister of Finance, stated that 1 January 2014 was a more likely date to start issuing euros due to delays in adopting the legislation required by the monetary agreement. However, EU approval to begin minting the coins was delayed until December 2013, so the first Andorran coins were delayed, with Minister of Culture Stephen Albert stating that he was optimistic they would be released by March or April 2014.
Dependent territories outside the EU.
Outside the EU, there are currently four French territories and a British territory that have agreements to use the euro as their currency. All other dependent territories of eurozone member states that have opted not to be a part of EU, usually with Overseas Country and Territory (OCT) status, use local currencies which are often pegged to the euro or US dollar. As non-sovereign entities, dependent territories which have adopted the euro are not permitted to mint euro coins like the European microstates, nor do they get a seat in the European Central Bank (ECB) or the Eurogroup. France is responsible for ensuring that the laws governing the EMU apply in their territories which use the euro.
The first OCTs to adopt the euro through a monetary agreement were the French overseas territories of Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, located off the coast of Canada, and Mayotte in the Indian Ocean. They both adopted the euro on 1 January 1999 when the currency was first introduced at the electronic level. Mayotte subsequently held a referendum in 2009 in which it decided to become an integral part of France. Its status was changed from an OCT to an OMR, where EU laws apply without separate agreements, on 1 January 2014, which rendered the previous monetary agreement unnecessary.
On 22 February 2007, Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin were politically separated from the French Outermost region (OMR) Guadeloupe to form two new French overseas collectivities, causing their status in the EU to briefly be in legal limbo until ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon reaffirmed both territories remained in the EU. The euro continued to be used in both territories throughout this time without incident. When Saint Barthélemy subsequently became an overseas territory of the European Union on 1 January 2012, changing its status to an OCT, the territory had to sign a monetary agreement to continue using the euro.
With the adoption of the euro by Cyprus per 1 January 2008, the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, which had previously used the Cypriot pound, also decided to adopt the euro. The base areas are overseas territories of the United Kingdom, an EU member state which itself does not use the euro, but are outside of the EU and under military jurisdiction. Their laws and currency have been aligned with those of the Republic of Cyprus, leading to the euro's adoption in the two areas.
Unilateral adopters.
Montenegro and Kosovo have also used the euro since its launch, as they previously used the German mark rather than the Yugoslav dinar. This was due to political concerns that Serbia would use the currency to destabilise these provinces (Montenegro was then in a union with Serbia) so they received Western help in adopting and using the mark (though there was no restriction on the use of the dinar or any other currency). They switched to the euro when the mark was replaced but have no agreement with the ECB; rather the country depends only on euros already in circulation. Kosovo also still uses the Serbian dinar in areas mainly populated by the Serbian minority.
The use of the euro in Montenegro and Kosovo has helped stabilise their economies, and for this reason the adoption of the euro by small states has been encouraged by former Finance Commissioner Joaquín Almunia. Former European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet has stated the ECB – which does not grant representation to those who unilaterally adopt the euro – neither supports nor deters those wishing to use the currency.
In October 2012, the President of Panama Ricardo Martinelli suggested that he was considering making the euro an official currency of the country to go along with the US dollar.
Usage in states with another official currency.
In various countries the euro is accepted by some merchants albeit not being official currency there. Additionally sometimes it is used for pricing purposes even if the actual payments are made in the official currency (e.g., for real estate).
EU members outside the Eurozone.
The Swedish town Höganäs, does, since 1 January 2009, generally allow shop payments in euros alongside the Swedish krona. Widespread usage, though unofficial, is also present in towns such as Haparanda, on the border with Finland. The euro is often accepted in shops near other borders to the Eurozone, like the borders of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary shared with Germany, Austria, Slovenia or Slovakia, the border areas of Switzerland and more. Tourist oriented shops in the United Kingdom usually accept the euro. In Northern Ireland, as a border area, the euro is accepted in many shops. Also, a large number of filling stations and motorway service areas in European countries outside the eurozone accept the euro, and both Croatia and Serbia allow payment of highway tolls in euros.
Northern Cyprus.
EU law and treaties application to Northern Cyprus is currently suspended. Its territory is claimed by the Republic of Cyprus, one of the EU member states, but currently Northern Cyprus is under Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) control. The TRNC is not recognised by the Republic of Cyprus (which claims jurisdiction over the whole island), by the European Union or by any country other than Turkey. EU law would start to apply in Northern Cyprus if it comes under control of the Republic of Cyprus (if the Cyprus dispute is resolved through unification), whose official legal tender is the euro.
Presently, the TRNC government has declared the Turkish lira to be its legal tender. The euro (along with other major currencies, such as the US dollar and the British pound) can be used to pay for goods and services in many shops related to or situated near tourist hotspots, as well as in some major supermarkets. However the exchange rate used by these businesses may not always reflect the true value of the currencies involved. The Cypriot euro coins, using both Greek and Turkish languages, have been designed to avoid any bias towards any particular area of the island, in keeping with both Greek and Turkish being the official languages of the Republic of Cyprus.
Some in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) have called for the unilateral adoption of the euro by that state (similar to other states).
Trading currency.
In 1998, Cuba announced that it would replace the US dollar with the euro as its official currency for the purposes of international trading. On 1 December 2002, North Korea did the same. (Its internal currency, the wŏn, is not convertible and thus cannot be used to purchase foreign goods. The euro also enjoys popularity domestically, especially among elites and resident foreigners.) Syria followed suit in 2006.
In 2000, President of Iraq Saddam Hussein began the sale of his country's oil denominated in euros rather than US dollars since the majority of Iraqi oil trade was with the EU, India and China rather than the United States. Several other oil producing countries stated they would follow suit. But when Iraq was invaded in 2003, the new US administration immediately switched all sales of oil back to the US dollar. Also, since 2007 Iran has asked all petroleum customers to pay in non US dollar currency, this is a response to American sanctions. This has resulted in the Iranian oil bourse trading in several currencies, predominantly the euro for European trade and either the yen or euros for sales in Asia.
Pegged currencies.
Currently there are several currencies pegged to the euro, some with fluctuation bands around a central rate and others with no fluctuations allowed around the central rate. This can be seen as a safety measure, especially for currencies of areas with weak economies. The euro is seen as a stable currency, i.e., there are no dramatic appreciations or depreciations of its value that might suddenly damage the economy or harm trade. Thus it provides security to traders and people holding that currency.
In 2011 the Swiss franc was rapidly appreciating against the euro, harming its exports to the eurozone. In response, Switzerland implemented a cap to the Swiss franc's value. This was not so much a peg, as they were merely limiting its highest value and not its lowest.
The Bulgarian lev is pegged to the euro through a currency board. Lithuania joined ERM II on 28 June 2004, Latvia joined on 2 May 2005; these currencies had been pegged to the euro before joining ERM II. As part of ERM II, the currencies have a fluctuation band of ±15%. Denmark, however, has committed to a tighter fluctuation band of 2.25%.
Convertible mark is the currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and it was fixed to 1 German mark when it was introduced on the basis of the Dayton agreement; consequently after introduction of the euro, the Convertible mark uses the German-mark-to-euro rate at 1.95583 BAM per euro.
Reserve currency status.
The euro is a major global reserve currency, sharing that status with the US dollar (USD), which continues to be the primary reserve of most commercial and central banks.
Since its introduction, the euro has been the second most widely held international reserve currency after the US dollar. The euro inherited this status from the German mark, and since its introduction, it has increased its standing, mostly at the expense of the dollar. The increase of 4.4% in 2002 is due to the introduction of euro banknotes and coins in January 2002.
The possibility of the euro's becoming the first international reserve currency is now widely debated among economists.
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gave his opinion in September 2007 that the euro could indeed replace the US dollar as the world's primary reserve currency. He said it is "absolutely conceivable that the euro will replace the dollar as reserve currency, or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency."
Additionally, there has been suggestion that recent weakness of the US dollar might encourage parties to increase their reserves in euro at the expense of the dollar. In the second term of 2007, euro as a reserve currency had reached a record level of 25.6% (a +0.8% increase from the year before) – at the expense of US dollar, which dropped to 64.8% (a drop of 1.3% from the year before). By the end of 2007, shares of euro increased to 26.4% as the dollar slumped to its lowest level since records began in 1999, 63.8%.
The exact situation varies from country to country; for example, those with dollar pegs have greater dollar reserves and those with euro pegs have greater euro reserves. In 2009, Russia's foreign reserves in euro exceed dollar reserves for the first time; Russia held 47.5% (up from 42% in 2008) in euro and 41.5% (down from 47%) in dollar leading the Central Bank of Russia to announce the euro had become the reserve currency of Russia. The usage of the euro is particularly strong in eastern Europe, not surprisingly in those that have joined the EU, with 54.8% of all loans in Bulgaria, and 85.2% in Latvia before Eurozone accession, being issued in euro rather than the local currencies.
The following table shows central banks allocated reserves in euros and US dollar.
A currency is attractive for international transactions when it demonstrates stability, a well-developed financial market to trade the currency, and acceptability to others. While the euro has made substantial progress, a few challenges undermine the ascension of the euro as a major reserve currency. Persistent excessive budget deficits of some member nations, economically weak new members, conservatism of financial markets, and inertia or path dependence are important factors keeping the euro as a junior international currency to the US dollar. However, at the same time, the USD has increasingly suffered from a double deficit and has its own concerns.
As the euro becomes a new reserve currency, Eurozone governments will enjoy substantial benefits. Since money is an interest-free loan to the issuing government by the holder of the currency, foreign reserves act as a subsidy to the country minting the currency (see Seigniorage). However, reserve status also holds risks, as the currency may become overvalued, hurting European exporters and potentially exposing the European economy to influence by external factors who hold large quantities of euros.

Iapygia quadrangle

The Iapygia quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Iapygia quadrangle is also referred to as MC-21 (Mars Chart-21).
The Iapygia quadrangle covers the area from 270° to 315° west longitude and from 0° to 30° south latitude on Mars. The largest crater in this quadrangle is Huygens. Some interesting features in this quadrangle are dikes. the many layers found in Terby Crater, and the presence of carbonates on the rim of Huygens Crater.
Dikes.
Near Huygens, especially just to the east are a number of narrow ridges which appear to be the remnants of dikes, like the ones around Shiprock, New Mexico. The dikes were once under the surface, but have now been eroded. Dikes are magma-filled cracks that often carry lava to the surface. Dikes by definition cut across rock layers. Some dikes on earth are associated with mineral deposits. Discovering dikes on Mars means that perhaps future colonists will be able to mine needed minerals on Mars, instead of transporting them all the way from the Earth.
Craters.
Impact craters generally have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits. Sometimes craters will display layers. Since the collision that produces a crater is like a powerful explosion, rocks from deep underground are tossed unto the surface. Hence, craters can show us what lies deep under the surface.
Carbonates.
Carbonates (calcium or iron carbonates) were discovered in a crater on the rim of Huygens Crater. The impact on the rim exposed material that had been dug up from the impact that created Huygens. These minerals represent evidence that Mars once was had a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere with abundant moisture. These kinds of carbonates only form when there is a lot of water. They were found with the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Earlier, the instrument had detected clay minerals. The carbonates were found near the clay minerals. Both of these minerals form in wet environments. It is supposed that billions of years age Mars was much warmer and wetter. At that time, carbonates would have formed from water and the carbon dioxide-rich amosphere. Later the deposits of carbonate would have been buried. The double impact has now exposed the minerals. Earth has vast carbonate deposits in the form of limestone.

Mare Tyrrhenum quadrangle

The Mare Tyrrhenum quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Mare Tyrrhenum quadrangle is also referred to as MC-22 (Mars Chart-22).
The Mare Tyrrhenum quadrangle covers the area from 225° to 270° west longitude and 0° to 30° south latitude on Mars. Schiaparelli named the area after Earth's Tyrrhenian Sea, which lies between Italy and Sicily. The region was subsequently renamed to Mare Tyrrhena after spacecraft photos revealed that it is an old, cratered plain rather than a sea. It contains the large volcano Tyrrhenus Mons, one of the oldest, and perhaps the most complex volcanoes on Mars. Mare Tyrrhenum's largest crater is Herschel. Licus Vallis and the Ausonia Montes are other major features in the region.
Fossa on Mars.
Large troughs (long narrow depressions) are called fossae in the geographical language used for Mars. Troughs form when the crust is stretched until it breaks. The stretching can be due to the large weight of a nearby volcano. Fossae/pit craters are common near volcanoes in the Tharsis and Elysium system of volcanoes. A trough often has two breaks with a middle section moving down, leaving steep cliffs along the sides; such a trough is called a graben. Lake George, in northern New York State, is a lake that sits in a graben. Studies have found that on Mars a fault may be as deep as 5 km, that is the break in the rock goes down to 5 km. Moreover, the crack or fault sometimes widens or dilates. This widening causes a void to form with a relatively high volume. When material slides into the void, a pit crater or a pit crater chain forms. Pit craters do not have rims or ejecta around them, like impact craters do. On Mars, individual pit craters can join to form chains or even to form troughs that are sometimes scalloped. Other ideas have been suggested for the formation of fossae and pit craters. There is evidence that they are associated with dikes of magma. Magma might move along, under the surface, breaking the rock and more importantly melting ice. The resulting action would cause a crack to form at the surface. Pit craters are not common on Earth. Sinkholes, where the ground falls into a hole (sometimes in the middle of a town) resemble pit craters on Mars. However, on the Earth these holes are caused by limestone being dissolved thereby causing a void. Tyrrhenus Mons has some beautiful fossae and pit craters associated with it. These features are easily visible in the gallery image below, obtained by HiRISE.
Knowledge of the locations and formation mechanisms of pit craters and fossae is important for the future colonization of Mars because they may be reservoirs of water.

<doc id="21553222" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21553222" title="Ecopass">
Ecopass

The Ecopass program was a traffic pollution charge implemented in Milan, Italy, as an urban toll for some motorists traveling within a designated traffic restricted zone or ZTL (), corresponding to the central "Cerchia dei Bastioni" area and encircling around . The Ecopass was implemented as a one-year trial program on January 2, 2008, and later extended until December 31, 2009. A public consultation was planned to be conducted early in 2009 to decide if the charge becomes permanent.
Subsequently, the current charge-scheme was prolonged until December 31, 2011 and starting from January 16, 2012 a new scheme (called Area C) was introduced, actually converting it from a pollution-charge to a conventional congestion charge.
The primary purpose of the program was to reduce traffic and air pollution (it was based on a fee structure according to the vehicle's engine emission standards) and to use the funds raised through the charge to finance public transportation projects, cycle paths and green vehicles. This program was similar to the congestion pricing programs implemented in London and Stockholm, but actually corresponded to a variation of these pricing schemes as only vehicles with high-polluting engines entering the ZTL were charged, and the ones with older most polluting engines were banned.
Background.
Milan has one of the highest European rates of car ownership, as more than half of Milan citizens use private cars and motorcycles, ranking second only after Rome, and among the highest in the world. The city also has the third-highest concentration of airborne particulate matter among large European cities, both in terms of average annual level and days of exceeding the European Union PM10 limit of 50 micrograms per cubic meter, according to a 2007 study supported by several environmental groups. Due to its lingering air pollution problems and associated health problems, in 2007, and for a trial period, the city banned 170,000 older cars and motorcycles that do not pass strict environmental emission standards.
In January 2008 the mayor of Milan, Letizia Moratti and her deputy for mobility and environment Edoardo Croci, launched the Ecopass program expecting a 30% cut in pollution levels and a 10% reduction in traffic. She said that it was part of a wider project to reduce smog in the Lombardy region and increase the use of public transportation. The mayor forecast that the scheme would raise € 24 million a year, two thirds of which would be invested into public transportation. Because of opposition, even among her own political allies, the original plan had to be scaled down as the traffic restricted zone (ZTL) was reduced from a planned 60 km2 to 8 km2. The implemented Ecopass ZTL represents just 5% of the city's area. Also the launch was delayed from October 2007 until after the Christmas and New Year holidays, and the mayor was forced to include discounts for local residents.
Description.
The amount of the charge depended on the vehicle's engine emissions standard and fees vary from € 2 to €10 on weekdays from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free access to the ZTL was granted to several types of alternative fuel vehicles and for conventional fuel vehicles compliant with the Euro3 and Euro4 or better. Residents within the restricted zone were exempted only if driving higher emission standard vehicles while owners of vehicles with older more polluting engines a discount only if they buy an annual pass that can go up to €250 depending on the vehicle's engine emission standards. Enforcement is carried out through digital cameras located at 43 electronic gates, with fines for offenders varying between €70 to €275. The Ecopass fee can be paid before entering the ZTL or up to midnight the next day after entering. There are daily and multiple-day passes. Payment of the fee can be made via internet, by telephone, in designated banks or by direct debit to the user's bank account, by first an Ecopass card must be issue at designated places.
There were also restrictions on entering the ZTL between 7:30 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. for trucks with a length greater than 7 m; commercial loading and unloading operations are restricted to pre-established schedules; and the vehicles with older more polluting engines were forbidden to enter the ZTL during six months a year.
Milanese authorities decided to temporarily suspend charging the Ecopass fees during a three-week period in August 2008 in order to facilitate tourism inside the restricted area (ZTL), considering that during this time of the summer local traffic drops by around 30% and pollution levels are usually at a minimum level.
Early results.
Traffic and transit.
An estimated 98,000 vehicles were entering the restricted area before the Ecopass came into force. According to an evaluation conducted by the Milanese Agency of Mobility and the Environment in December 2008, during the first month traffic inside the ZTL fell to 82,200 vehicles, and for the first eleven months the average traffic flow was 87,700 vehicles. This represents 12.3% fewer vehicles entering the ZTL, while outside of the Ecopass area traffic decreased by 3.6%. Meanwhile, surface public transportation service grew by 1,300 additional daily runs, carrying an average of 19,100 additional daily passengers, an increment of 7.3% for this eleven-month period. For the morning rush hour during the same months the number of congested kilometers in the interior traffic network fell by 25.1% and average travel speed improved 4.0%, translating into Euro 9.3 million saved by year. Traffic accidents inside the ZTL also fell by 20.6%.
Air pollution.
A comparison of the type of vehicles entering the ZTL by engine standard with respect to the months of October and November 2007 found that there has been a change in the composition of the fleet entering the restricted area, with a sharp reduction of older vehicles with lower emission standard engines. The number of vehicles subject to the charge fell by 56.4%, representing an average reduction of 21,274 vehicles per day, with a greater variation among auto drivers when compared to commercial vehicles. The number of exempt vehicles grew by 4.3%, for an average increase of 2.248 vehicles a day.
The Milanese Agency of Mobility and the Environment report shows that during the first eleven months of the Ecopass program the number of days exceeding the permitted level of particulate matter of 50 μg/m3 fell to 83 days, in contrast to the period January to November 2002 to 2007, when the average number of days exceeding this limit was 125 days. This study also found that between January and November (excluding August when the charge was temporarily suspended), all traffic related emissions were lower. PM10 decreased by 23%, particulate matter decreased by 18%, NH3 fell 47%, NOx was reduced by 15%, and CO2 emission were cut by 14%.
The city of Milan was awarded a 2009 Sustainable Transport Honorable Mention by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) for the introduction and success of its Ecopass program.
Restrictions and fees by type of vehicle.
Any motor vehicle built before the Euro emission standards were in force (called pre-E) is not allowed to enter the restricted zone (ZTL) from October 15 to April 15, as these vehicles have the worst polluting engines and the weather during this period worsens air quality. This is a restriction in force in the entire Lombardy region since 2007. Cleaner vehicles are exempted from the pollution charge and there is free access for all vehicles on Saturdays and Sundays, except as noted above. The amount of the charge payable depends on the type of vehicle according with their compliance with the European emission standards, and there is a discounted annual pass for residents within the restricted zone (ZTL). The following table details the daily and annual charges and the type of vehicles that are exempted.
Controversy and criticism.
The process leading to the approval and implementation of the Ecopass began in 2006 and it was a controversial process with open conflict, involving intense public debate, political rhetoric and statements by public authorities at the local and regional level. With such a wide public discussion the degree of concern among the Milan citizens over environmental pollution is evident. One survey made by a leading newspaper stated that 76% of Milan residents thought that the quality of environment has worsened, but 43% declared that traffic is the primary problem not pollution. The Milan Mayor, Letizia Moratti, launched the Ecopass program even with opposition among her own political allies, and the original plan had to be scaled down to a smaller area, and the traffic restricted zone (ZTL) project was reduced significantly. During these discussions some critics argued that "the pollution charge should not just be an extra tax", others were upset that wider action was not taken. They argued that "car exhaust is an important source of particulate matter but it's not the only one."
This controversial tone lessened after the initial results reported a successful first month after Ecopass implementation. However, some doctors have complained that even as pollution level has been reduced, the improvement in air quality had been insufficient, and they are advocating for the pollution charge to be raised and the ZTL to be extended outwards.
During the first months of operation quality of service complaints increased. These mainly regarded the lack of reliability of the payment system. A frequent complaint was over the Ecopass website. The dedicated link for toll payments has broken down on several occasions and users have threatened legal action. Another complaint relates to the long queue of appeals waiting to be resolved by the courts, as all cases are scheduled to start no earlier than March 2009.
Before the Ecopass came into force there were around 98 thousand vehicles entering the restricted zone every day, but now traffic in the ZTL is approaching 87,000 daily vehicles (91,7 thousand in November 2008) and it seems traffic jams are slowly coming back to the pre-Ecopass levels. In the same regard, another criticism is the slow erosion of the system benefits, as the Ecopass price structure has been an incentive for car owners to buy new vehicles, and now more than 7,000 vehicles per day have free access. Despite the fact that these vehicles having less polluting engines, the free access helps less with the congestion problem. This trend is contributing to a return to previous traffic levels and at the same time reducing revenue collected. This threatens the ability to keep the system in operation. Also it was criticized the decision to maintain the exemption for Euro IV diesel vehicles when authorities decided to extend the Ecopass until December 2009, because this decision is also contributing to the fading of the initial benefits.
New system.
A new congestion charge was introduced on 16 January 2012, replacing the Ecopass system. The new system, Area C, is based on the same Ecopass area, but every vehicle need to pay €5 regardless of their pollution level. Residents inside the area have 40 free access per year and a discounted fare of €2.

Aeolis quadrangle

The Aeolis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Aeolis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-23 (Mars Chart-23).
The Aeolis quadrangle covers 180° to 225° W and 0° to 30° south on Mars. It is famous as the site of two spacecraft landings: the Spirit Rover landing site () in Gusev crater (January 4, 2004), and the Curiosity Rover in Gale Crater () (August 6, 2012).
A large, ancient river valley, called Ma'adim Vallis, enters at the south rim of Gusev Crater, so Gusev Crater was believed to be an ancient lake bed. However, it seems that a volcanic flow covered up the lakebed sediments. Apollinaris Patera, a large volcano, lies directly north of Gusev Crater.
Gale Crater, in the northwestern part of the Aeolis quadrangle, is of special interest to geologists because it contains a 2–4 km (1.2–2.5 mile) high mound of layered sedimentary rocks, named "Mount Sharp" by NASA in honor of Robert P. Sharp (1911–2004), a planetary scientist of early Mars missions. More recently, on 16 May 2012, "Mount Sharp" was officially named Aeolis Mons by the USGS and IAU.
Some regions in the Aeolis quadrangle show inverted relief. In these locations, a stream bed may be a raised feature, instead of a valley. The inverted former stream channels may be caused by the deposition of large rocks or due to cementation. In either case erosion would erode the surrounding land but leave the old channel as a raised ridge because the ridge will be more resistant to erosion
Yardangs are another feature found in this quadrangle They are generally visible as a series of parallel linear ridges, caused by the direction of the prevailing wind.
Spirit Rover discoveries.
The rocks on the plains of Gusev are a type of basalt. They contain the minerals olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase, and magnetite, and they look like volcanic basalt as they are fine-grained with irregular holes (geologists would say they have vesicles and vugs).
Much of the soil on the plains came from the breakdown of the local rocks. Fairly high levels of nickel were found in some soils; probably from meteorites.
Analysis shows that the rocks have been slightly altered by tiny amounts of water. Outside coatings and cracks inside the rocks suggest water deposited minerals, maybe bromine compounds. All the rocks contain a fine coating of dust and one or more harder kinds of material. One type can be brushed off, while another needed to be ground off by the Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT).
There are a variety of rocks in the Columbia Hills (Mars), some of which have been altered by water, but not by very much water.
The dust in Gusev Crater is the same as dust all around the planet. All the dust was found to be magnetic. Moreover, Spirit found the magnetism was caused by the mineral magnetite, especially magnetite that contained the element titanium. One magnet was able to completely divert all dust hence all Martian dust is thought to be magnetic. The spectra of the dust was similar to spectra of bright, low thermal inertia regions like Tharsis and Arabia that have been detected by orbiting satellites. A thin layer of dust, maybe less than one millimeter thick covers all surfaces. Something in it contains a small amount of chemically bound water.
Plains.
Observations of rocks on the plains show they contain the minerals pyroxene, olivine, plagioclase, and magnetite. These rocks can be classified in different ways. The amounts and types of minerals make the rocks primitive basalts—also called picritic basalts. The rocks are similar to ancient terrestrial rocks called basaltic komatiites. Rocks of the plains also resemble the basaltic shergottites, meteorites which came from Mars. One classification system compares the amount of alkali elements to the amount of silica on a graph; in this system, Gusev plains rocks lie near the junction of basalt, picrobasalt, and tephite. The Irvine-Barager classification calls them basalts.
Plain’s rocks have been very slightly altered, probably by thin films of water because they are softer and contain veins of light colored material that may be bromine compounds, as well as coatings or rinds. It is thought that small amounts of water may have gotten into cracks inducing mineralization processes.
Coatings on the rocks may have occurred when rocks were buried and interacted with thin films of water and dust.
One sign that they were altered was that it was easier to grind these rocks compared to the same types of rocks found on Earth.
The first rock that Spirit studied was Adirondack. It turned out to be typical of the other rocks on the plains.
Columbia Hills.
Scientists found a variety of rock types in the Columbia Hills, and they placed them into six different categories. The six are: Clovis, Wishbone, Peace, Watchtower, Backstay, and Independence. They are named after a prominent rock in each group. Their chemical compositions, as measured by APXS, are significantly different from each other. Most importantly, all of the rocks in Columbia Hills show various degrees of alteration due to aqueous fluids.
They are enriched in the elements phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, and bromine—all of which can be carried around in water solutions. The Columbia Hills’ rocks contain basaltic glass, along with varying amounts of olivine and sulfates.
The olivine abundance varies inversely with the amount of sulfates. This is exactly what is expected because water destroys olivine but helps to produce sulfates.
The Clovis group is especially interesting because the Mössbauer spectrometer(MB) detected goethite in it. Goethite forms only in the presence of water, so its discovery is the first direct evidence of past water in the Columbia Hills's rocks. In addition, the MB spectra of rocks and outcrops displayed a strong decline in olivine presence,
although the rocks probably once contained much olivine. Olivine is a marker for the lack of water because it easily decomposes in the presence of water. Sulfate was found, and it needs water to form.
Wishstone contained a great deal of plagioclase, some olivine, and anhydrate (a sulfate). Peace rocks showed sulfur and strong evidence for bound water, so hydrated sulfates are suspected. Watchtower class rocks lack olivine consequently they may have been altered by water. The Independence class showed some signs of clay (perhaps montmorillonite a member of the smectite group). Clays require fairly long term exposure to water to form.
One type of soil, called Paso Robles, from the Columbia Hills, may be an evaporate deposit because it contains large amounts of sulfur, phosphorus, calcium, and iron.
Also, MB found that much of the iron in Paso Robles soil was of the oxidized, Fe+++ form, which would happen if water had been present.
Towards the middle of the six-year mission (a mission that was supposed to last only 90 days), large amounts of pure silica were found in the soil. The silica could have come from the interaction of soil with acid vapors produced by volcanic activity in the presence of water or from water in a hot spring environment.
After Spirit stopped working scientists studied old data from the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer, or Mini-TES and confirmed the presence of large amounts of carbonate-rich rocks, which means that regions of the planet may have once harbored water. The carbonates were discovered in an outcrop of rocks called "Comanche."
In summary, Spirit found evidence of slight weathering on the plains of Gusev, but no evidence that a lake was there. However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering. The evidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates which only form in the presence of water. It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials. All the dust contains a magnetic component which was identified as magnetite with some titanium. Furthermore the thin coating of dust that covers everything on Mars is the same in all parts of Mars.
Ma'adim Vallis.
A large, ancient river valley, called Ma'adim Vallis, enters at the south rim of Gusev Crater, so Gusev Crater was believed to be an ancient lake bed. However, it seems that a volcanic flow covered up the lakebed sediments. Apollinaris Patera, a large volcano, lies directly north of Gusev Crater.
Recent studies lead scientists to believe that the water that formed Ma'adim Vallis originated in a complex of lakes. When the largest lake spilled over the low point in its boundary, a torrential flood would have moved north, carving the sinuous Ma'adim Vallis. At the north end of Ma'adim Vallis, the flood waters would have run into Gusev Crater.
Gale Crater.
Gale Crater, in the northwestern part of the Aeolis quadrangle, is of special interest to geologists because it contains a 2–4 km (1.2–2.5 mile) high mound of layered sedimentary rocks. On 28 March 2012 this mound was named "Mount Sharp" by NASA in honor of Robert P. Sharp (1911–2004), a planetary scientist of early Mars missions. More recently, on 16 May 2012, Mount Sharp was officially named Aeolis Mons by the USGS and IAU. The mound extends higher than the rim of the crater, so perhaps the layering covered an area much larger than the crater. These layers are a complex record of the past. The rock layers probably took millions of years to be laid down within the crater, then more time to be eroded to make them visible. The 5 km high mound is probably the thickest single succession of sedimentary rocks on Mars. The lower formation may date from near the Noachian age, while the upper layer, separated by an erosional unconformity, may be as young as the Amazonian period. The lower formation may have formed the same time as parts of Sinus Meridiani and Mawrth Vallis. The upper layer may be similar to layers in Arabia Terra. Sulfates and Iron oxides have been detected in the lower formation and anhydrous phases in the upper layer. There is evidence that the first phase of erosion was followed by more cratering and more rock formation. Also of interest in Gale Crater is Peace Vallis, officially named by the IAU on September 26, 2012, which 'flows' down out of the Gale Crater hills to the Aeolis Palus below, and which seems to have been carved by flowing water. On December 9, 2013, NASA reported that, based on evidence from "Curiosity" studying Aeolis Palus, Gale Crater contained an ancient freshwater lake which could have been a hospitable environment for microbial life.
Other Craters.
Impact craters generally have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits. As craters get larger (greater than 10 km in diameter) they usually have a central peak. The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact. Sometimes craters will display layers. Since the collision that produces a crater is like a powerful explosion, rocks from deep underground are tossed unto the surface. Hence, craters can show us what lies deep under the surface.
Mars Science Laboratory discoveries.
The aim of the Mars Science Laboratory mission, and its surface robotic payload "Curiosity" rover, is to search for signs of ancient life. It is hoped that a later mission could then return samples that the laboratory identified as probably containing remains of life. To safely bring the craft down, a 12 mile wide, smooth, flat circle was needed. Geologists hoped to examine places where water once ponded and to examine sedimentary layers.
On August 6, 2012, the Mars Science Laboratory landed on Aeolis Palus near Aeolis Mons in Gale Crater. The landing was from the target (), closer than any previous rover landing and well within the target area.
On September 27, 2012, NASA scientists announced that the "Curiosity rover" found evidence for an ancient streambed suggesting a "vigorous flow" of water on Mars.
On October 17, 2012, at "Rocknest", the first X-ray diffraction analysis of Martian soil was performed. The results revealed the presence of several minerals, including feldspar, pyroxenes and olivine, and suggested that the Martian soil in the sample was similar to the weathered basaltic soils of Hawaiian volcanoes. The sample used is composed of dust distributed from global dust storms and local fine sand. So far, the materials "Curiosity" has analyzed are consistent with the initial ideas of deposits in Gale Crater recording a transition through time from a wet to dry environment.
On December 3, 2012, NASA reported that "Curiosity" performed its first extensive soil analysis, revealing the presence of water molecules, sulfur and chlorine in the Martian soil. The presence of perchlorates in the sample seems highly likely. The presence of sulfate and sulfide is also likely because sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide were detected. Small amounts of chloromethane, dichloromethane and trichloromethane were detected. The source of the carbon in these molecules is unclear. Possible sources include contamination of the instrument, organics in the sample and inorganic carbonates.
On March 18, 2013, NASA reported evidence of mineral hydration, likely hydrated calcium sulfate, in several rock samples including the broken fragments of "Tintina" rock and "Sutton Inlier" rock as well as in veins and nodules in other rocks like "Knorr" rock and "Wernicke" rock. Analysis using the rover's DAN instrument provided evidence of subsurface water, amounting to as much as 4% water content, down to a depth of , in the rover's traverse from the "Bradbury Landing" site to the "Yellowknife Bay" area in the "Glenelg" terrain.
In March 2013, NASA reported "Curiosity" found evidence that geochemical conditions in Gale Crater were once suitable for microbial life after analyzing the first drilled sample of Martian rock, "John Klein" rock at "Yellowknife Bay" in Gale Crater. The rover detected water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. Chloromethane and dichloromethane were also detected. Related tests found results consistent with the presence of smectite clay minerals.
In the journal Science from September 2013, researchers described a different type of rock called ""Jake M"" or ""Jake Matijevic (rock)",” It was the first rock analyzed by the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer instrument on the Curiosity rover, and it was different from other known martian igneous rocks as it is alkaline (>15% normative nepheline) and relatively fractionated. "Jake M" is similar to terrestrial mugearites, a rock type typically found at ocean islands and continental rifts. "Jake M" discovery may mean that alkaline magmas may be more common on Mars than on Earth and that Curiosity could encounter even more fractionated alkaline rocks (for example, phonolites and trachytes).
On December 9, 2013, NASA researchers described, in a series of six articles in the journal Science, many new discoveries from the Curiosity rover. Possible organics were found that could not be explained by contamination. Although the organic carbon was probably from Mars, it can all be explained by dust and meteorites that have landed on the planet. Because much of the carbon was released at a relatively low temperature in Curiosity’s Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument package, it probably did not come from carbonates in the sample. The carbon could be from organisms, but this has not been proven. This organic-bearing material was obtained by drilling 5 centimeters deep in a site called "Yellowknife Bay" into a rock called “"Sheepbed mudstone"”. The samples were named "John Klein" and "Cumberland". Microbes could be living on Mars by obtaining energy from chemical imbalances between minerals in a process called chemolithotrophy which means “eating rock.” However, in this process only a very tiny amount of carbon is involved — much less than was found at "Yellowknife Bay".
Using SAM’s mass spectrometer, scientists measured isotopes of helium, neon, and argon that cosmic rays produce as they go through rock. The fewer of these isotopes they find, the more recently the rock has been exposed near the surface. The 4-billion-year-old lakebed rock drilled by Curiosity was uncovered between 30 million and 110 million years ago by winds which sandblasted away 2 meters of overlying rock. Next, they hope to find a site tens of millions of years younger by drilling close to an overhanging outcrop.
The absorbed dose and dose equivalent from galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles on the Martian surface for ~300 days of observations during the current solar maximum was measured. These measurements are necessary for human missions to the surface of Mars, to provide microbial survival times of any possible extant or past life, and to determine how long potential organic biosignatures can be preserved. This study estimates that a 1-meter depth drill is necessary to access possible viable radioresistant microbe cells. The actual absorbed dose measured by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) is 76 mGy/yr at the surface. Based on these measurements, for a round trip Mars surface mission with 180 days (each way) cruise, and 500 days on the Martian surface for this current solar cycle, an astronaut would be exposed to a total mission dose equivalent of ~1.01 sievert. Exposure to 1 sievert is associated with a 5 percent increase in risk for developing fatal cancer. NASA's current lifetime limit for increased risk for its astronauts operating in low-Earth orbit is 3 percent. Maximum shielding from galactic cosmic rays can be obtained with about 3 meters of Martian soil.
The samples examined were probably once mud that for millions to tens of millions of years could have hosted living organisms. This wet environment had neutral pH, low salinity, and variable redox states of both iron and sulfur species. These types of iron and sulfur could have been used by living organisms. C, H, O, S, N, and P were measured directly as key biogenic elements, and by inference, P is assumed to have been there as well. The two samples, "John Klein" and "Cumberland", contain basaltic minerals, Ca-sulfates, Fe oxide/hydroxides, Fe-sulfides, amorphous material, and trioctahedral smectites (a type of clay). Basaltic minerals in the mudstone are similar to those in nearby aeoliandeposits. However, the mudstone has far less Fe-forsterite plus magnetite, so Fe-forsterite (type of olivine) was probably altered to form smectite (a type of clay) and magnetite. A Late Noachian/EarlyHesperian or younger age indicates that clay mineral formation on Mars extended beyond Noachian time; therefore, in this location neutral pH lasted longer than previously thought.
Inverted Relief.
Some places on Mars show inverted relief. In these locations, a stream bed may be a raised feature, instead of a valley. The inverted former stream channels may be caused by the deposition of large rocks or due to cementation. In either case erosion would erode the surrounding land but leave the old channel as a raised ridge because the ridge will be more resistant to erosion. An image below, taken with HiRISE shows sinuous ridges that may be old channels that have become inverted.
Yardangs.
Yardangs are common on Mars. They are generally visible as a series of parallel linear ridges. Their parallel nature is thought to be caused by the direction of the prevailing wind. Two HiRISE images below show a good view of yardangs in the Aeolis quadrangle. Yardangs are common in the Medusae Fossae Formation on Mars.

Josep Maria Sert

Josep Maria Sert i Badia () (Barcelona, 21 December 1874 – 27 November 1945, buried in the Vic cathedral) was a Catalan Spanish muralist, the son of an affluent textile industry family and friend of Salvador Dalí. He was particularly known for his grisaille style, often in gold and black.
Complementing his knowledge in Paris.
Beginning on his trip to Paris in 1899, aged 25, he first became involved on a personal and private level with artists ascribed to the group known as Les Nabis, gravitating around Paul Ranson (1864–1909), who had studied at the renowned private Académie Julian, founded in 1868 by painter Rodolphe Julian. The Académie Julian, along with Académie Colarossi, were frequented by would-be foreign painters, engravers and sculptors, both male and female, including Americans, and, unlike the official École des Beaux Arts, accepted female students and allowed them to draw from the nude male mode. Many of the nude models gracing today millionaires' residences and the world's museums came, either as students or models or both, from such private, none-too-prudish Paris art schools.
Notes on Sert's private life.
Sert married the well-known Misia Godebska, a.k.a. Misia Sert, (born Maria Zofia Olga Zenajda Godebska; 30 March 1872–1950), a pianist of Polish descent who hosted an artistic salon in Paris. She was a patron and friend of numerous artists, for whom she regularly posed. Her father, Cyprian Godebski (1835–1909), was a renowned Polish sculptor and professor at the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg from 1870. Her mother, Zofia Servais, was the daughter of a noted Belgian cellist, Adrien-François Servais. 
But after a few years, in 1928, he left her for the sculptress Isabelle Roussadana Mdivani (1906–1938), a.k.a. Roussie, sister of the famous Serge, Alexis, David, and Nina, the 5 siblings from a Georgian-Russian Nobility family emigrated after the Russian Revolution in 1917, known in Paris as the "Marrying Mdivani", because of the notorious marriages they achieved with moneyed and prestigious people from Europe and America. In some countries today, they would be described in the social chronicles as "The Beautiful People".
Locations of Sert's works.
Best-known public murals are in the Hôtel de Ville in Paris, the Cathedral of Vic in Catalonia, the League of Nations in Geneva and, in New York, at the Waldorf-Astoria and 30 Rockefeller Center, the GE Center. There, his “American Progress” replaced Diego Rivera’s mural Man at the Crossroads, which Nelson Rockefeller destroyed because it included an image of Lenin.

Lloyd (Bud) Winter

Lloyd C. Winter, better known as "Bud" (June 8, 1909 – December 6, 1985) was the USATF (then called TAC) Hall of Fame Track Coach. He was regarded as one of the greatest sprint coaches in the world. Over a 39-year coaching career (1941–1970) at the then San Jose State College, he produced 102 All-Americans, 27 who went on to become Olympians. Included in the list of successes were Olympic Gold Medalists Lee Evans, Tommie Smith and Ronnie Ray Smith. All the aforementioned also became World Record Holders, Evans' 1968 record in the 400 meters lasted almost 20 years—the first man to break 44 seconds, Smith's World Record in the 200 meters lasted over a decade—the first man to officially break 20 seconds. Winter also coached John Carlos, who can also lay claim to being the first man to break 20 seconds in the 200 meters (though his record was disallowed because of the "brush" type of spikes he used) and Christos Papanikolaou of Greece, who was the first man to clear 18 feet in the pole vault. As a team, San Jose State won the 1969 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Div I Track Championships, his teams placed in the top 10, fourteen times. Winters served as an assistant coach for the 1960 Olympic team in Tokyo.
Early Success.
Before joining SJSC, Winter coached Harold Davis at Hartnell College in Salinas, California to tying the world record in the 100 metres. Davis never had the opportunity to compete in the Olympics, his peak years falling during World War II. During the war, Winter taught relaxation techniques to Naval pilots. Also during that time, Winter invented a life jacket that would automatically inflate if it came in contact with water. It was those same relaxation techniques taught to sprinters that "allowed the speed to come out."
At SJSC, Winter's first success was Willie Steele, who went on to win the 1948 Gold Medal in the long jump. Winter's next success was with Ray Norton, previously from Oakland City College, bringing him to be the number one sprinter in the world and tying the world record in the 100 metres. California State Junior College sprint champion Bob “The Bullet” Poynter (later coach to Millard Hampton and Andre Phillips at Silver Creek High School) to give SJSC the top two sprinters in the world.
Also working with Winter as an assistant coach was Bert Bonanno, who went on to coach across town at San Jose City College. Bonanno later coached many of the athletes involved the 1970s resurgence of San Jose as a Track and Field hotbed, including Hampton, Phillips, John Powell and Bruce Jenner (all Olympic Medalists).
Speed City.
The track stadium at San Jose State University was named "Bud" Winter Field. While he was coaching, such was his success, it was known as "Speed City." Since his departure, to the embarrassment of Winter's legacy, San Jose State closed down its track program in the wake of Title IX. The stadium has fallen into disrepair. The famed Tartan track, which Winter caused to be one of the first such tracks in the world, is used as a parking lot for the neighboring Spartan Stadium. The site is now proposed to become a football/soccer stadium.
Author.
Winter authored the book "So You Want to be a Sprinter," still one of the leading works on the subject of sprinting.
There is also a video by the same name "So You Want to be a Sprinter".
Death.
Winter died of a heart attack in Houston at the age of 76 after playing a game of Racquetball with Bonanno, one day before his induction into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame. In 2010 he was inducted into the African-American Ethnic Sports Hall of Fame

Spot Pond Archeological District

The Spot Pond Archeological District is a historic archaeological site in Stoneham, Massachusetts. It is located in the Virginia Woods section of the Middlesex Fells Reservation, a state park. The district encompasses sites along Spot Pond Brook that were mill sites dating from the 17th to the 19th centuries. At its height, in the mid-19th century the Hayward Rubber Works was located in the area, giving it the name "Haywardville". One of the park's trails runs through the area, and a park pamphlet provide a self-guided tour joining the major remnants of the industries that once flourished there.
The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.

Schools in Worthing, West Sussex

Schools in Worthing are provided by West Sussex County Council and by a number of independent providers. Both non-denominational and Church of England maintained schools are organised along three tier lines, with students transferring from a first school at age 8 to a middle school, and then starting secondary school at age 12. This system was introduced in 1973 as part of a move to reorganise schools to provide comprehensive education across West Sussex.
The local authority provides 22 primary schools (through a combination of first, middle and combined schools) and five secondary schools, alongside a primary and a secondary special school.
In July 2013 it was announced that funding had been agreed by central government that would allow a new 900-place secondary school to be built in Broadwater, with a view to changing the age of transfer between primary and secondary schools.

Barmat scandal

The Barmat Scandal in 1924 and 1925 in Weimar Republic implicated the Social Democratic Party of Germany in Germany in charges of corruption, war profiteering, fraud, bribery, and financial misdeeds. The scandal provided right-wing political forces within Germany (including the young Nazi Party) with a basis with which to attack the Social Democrats and the republic itself. Antisemitism in connection with the scandal also featured prominently in Nazi propaganda, since the Barmat brothers were Jewish. The scandal was used by the German right to foster the belief that wealthy Jewish families, in quasi-criminal operations found fertile ground in the Republic and easily exploited the Social Democrats to do their bidding.. The right-wing press was eager to use Barmat Scandal as a vehicle for antisemitism.
Background and dramatis personæ.
The Weimar government was headed by Gustav Bauer, a Social Democrat, as Chancellor from June 1919 through March 1920. Friedrich Ebert was the Republic's initial President, from the end of World War I until his death in February 1925.
Julius Barmat was a Jewish wholesale merchant with "less than perfect character." He bought foodstuffs in the Netherlands to export into Germany (which had suffered badly during and after the war from lack of food) after the end of the war. He made a large amount of money in this endeavor and was—at least from the view of the nationalists—engaged in war profiteering.
Barmat had profited from political patrongage. He had joined the Dutch Social Democrats in 1908 and after the war had given the Social Democrats Second International free office space in his Amsterdam home. He consequently met German Social Democrats and developed connections that were helpful in transactions in foodstuffs for Germany.
Barmat also had connections with Ernst Heilman (the SPD leader in the Prussian Landtag) and Gustav Bauer (former Reich Chancellor). Heilmann became close friends with Julius and wrote letters of recommendation and served on the boards of six Barmat companies, but did not accept financial rewards. However, Wilhelm Richter, President of the Berlin Police, did receive gifts from Barmat.
Barmat also met Ebert as well as Otto Wels (Chairman of the SPD) and (indiscreetly, it appears in retrospect) bragged about his political connections.
The Misdeeds.
The Barmats received German visas and established business relations with various state offices, including the Prussian State Bank and the Preussichche Seehandlung. In return they donated around 20,000 Reichsmarks to Social Democratic newspapers, founded a children's home in Pirna, and paid commissions to Bauer.
The national government's postal department generated considerable cash as a result of the mail and it invested idle funds with Barmat's investment company. The Prussian State Bank also loaned a considerable sum of money to Barmat.
Barmat, however, engaged in currency speculation with the funds, and the Barmat investment company collapsed in late 1924. Both the national Weimar government and the Prussian State Bank lost several million dollars as a result of the Barmat firm's collapse, and a Reichstag commission was formed to investigate the matter. In addition, a commission of the Prussian Landtag was also formed to investigate. Most of the investigative work (and almost all of the publicity) came from this Landtag committee, or as a result of its work, rather than from the national committee of the central parliament.
Arrests and Revelations.
Various Prussian State Bank officials were arrested on 30 December 1924. The Barmat brothers were arrested early in the morning of the next day, New Year's Eve 1924.
Preliminary investigation suggested that several prominent Social Democrats had received bribes, kickbacks or other financial favors in exchange for their support of Government contracts with the Barmats. The evidence showed as follows for the leading protagonists:
Bauer.
Bauer did not handle the press accusations well, keeping silent when the press exposed his membership on the board of a Barmat company, and issuing a denial of any involvement in the affair in January 1925, after the arrest of the Barmat brothers. In particular, he denied any benefit by way of financial remuneration. This was a most unfortunate public statement for Bauer, because his opponents had specific documentary evidence that it was a lie.
The first climax of the Prussian investigating commission took place in late January 1925, with Bauer, a prominent Social Democrat, giving evidence.
During his period of government service, he had helped Barmat win food supply contracts with various Reich departments. After leaving office he helped Barmat one time with a Government scrap-metal deal; Bauer was to receive a commission from Barmat for this help. In late 1923 their relationship ended over a dispute as to the amount of "commission" that Bauer would receive for this deal.
Bauer had publicly denied that he served on any Barmat supervisory board; but this was a lie, and he was forced to admit as much under the cross-examination by the Commission. He was also forced to admit that his actions in helping Barmat win government contracts were considerably more frequent and more involved that his previous statements to the press had indicated.
Despite these reversals of his prior statements, he steadfastly and repeatedly continued to deny to the Commission that he had received any financial compensation from Barmat. However, in early February, only a few days after the testimony, the "Lokal-Anzeiger" reprinted a letter from Barmat to Bauer as a part of an article on the scandal. This letter was written during the period of their 1923 commission dispute over the scrap-metal deal, and identified the occasions on which Bauer had received money from Barmat.
Bauer was caught in a bald-faced lie and, it would appear, had committed perjury in denying any receipt of compensation. The SPD promptly asked Bauer to resign from the party and the Reichstag, and he did so on 6 February 1925.
The final report (October 1925) of Prussian Commission affirmed that Ebert had committed no improprieties in the affair and that his reputation was without strain relative to the scandal. While Bauer and Richter were reprimanded for careless and incautious conflict of interest, they had not profited directly or indirectly from the loans made to Barmat by the Prussian State Bank.
Ebert.
The Reich Presidency election would take place in spring of 1925. The right-wing would not forfeit a chance to discredit him by association with scandal.
A motion was made in the Landtag commission in early February to investigate Ebert's knowledge of the Barmat scandal, particularly any involvement by the office of the President with the Barmats. The testimony of 23 February 1925 before the Commission established that Barmat had received letters of recommendation bearing the Presidential seal. The right-wing press made much of the testimony. It turned out that an office employee had indeed dispatched several letters of recommendation to Barmat, bearing the Presidential Seal.
Ebert had unfortunately recommended in 1919 that Barmat be given a permanent visa for his many business trips to and from Germany.
Ebert was diagnosed with appendicitis and peritonitis on 26 February. He died two days later. He was ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing by the Prussian investigating committee in the fall of 1925. Mommsen claims that Ebert's death (28 February 1925) was caused in part by the strain brought on by the Barmat scandal (particularly a result of the right-wing vilification against the Prussian government).
Hofle.
Julius and Henry Barmat met with Dr. Anton Hofle, the Minister of Posts, in June 1924 and paid him bribes of some 120,000 Reichmarks over several months. They then borrowed 14.5 million Reichmarks from the national Postal Department in September 1924. The loan was not secured and the Republic's money was lost when Barmat's investment speculations turned sour.
Hofle resigned his Reichstag seat on 9 February 1925 and was arrested on 10 February 1925.
Hofle died, in custody and from a drug overdose, some six days before the second round of the Presidential election. The Catholic Center press accused the prosecutors of pumping Hofle full of narcotics so that he would be available for questioning and implied that this amounted to a form of homicide. The right-wing of course claimed that Hofle's death was a suicide that amounted to his confession of guilt in the Barmat affair.
Richter.
Three days after Hofle's arrest, Richter, the Police President of Prussia, was placed on an involuntary "leave" and a week later was dispatched into "interim retirement."
Heilmann.
Ernst Heilmann, the SPD leader in the Prussian Landtag, revealed no compromising information, other than that he had supported Barmat's request for additional funds in early December 1924, in discussions with the Prussian Finance Minister. He was never charged or sanctioned, although some commentators did consider his intervention with the Ministry of Finance to be improper.
Elections.
The right wing press in 1925 used the Barmat scandal as a vehicle to express its underlying anti-Semitic, anti-socialist and anti-democratic sentiments. An Austrian commentator perceptively noted that the right-wing press and propaganda campaign, using the Barmat scandal as the excuse and opportunity for expressing its sentiments, was more dangerous than the military coups to which the Republic had been subjected. The press campaign appealed to the hearts and minds of those who sought an excuse and a reason for the hardships and perceived injustices that Germany continued to suffer.
The right-wing successfully propagandized that corruption was an inherent characteristic of democracy and that the only solution was the abandonment of democracy and a return to the ways of the autocratic past. They referred to the "corruption economy" which was a result of the SPD leadership in post-war Germany. The scandal provided grist for the mill of right-wing propagandists, who could fulminate against Jewish speculators and profiteers as well as against all manner of Socialist politicians and others who supported the republic. Frustrated voters had an opportunity to channel their resentment against inflation and war profiteers against specific targets, and to transfer the responsibility for those ills to the Social Democrats.
The Presidential Election of 1925.
Reichstag elections were held 7 December 1924. Cabinet formation was complex, taking until 15 January. The result was a bourgeois coalition of rightist and center parties in the "Rechtsblock" under Hans Luther as Chancellor. The SDP went into opposition against the coalition of the Center, DVP and DNVP, and it promised the Luther government a "ruthless fight."
Barmat was one of Weimar's biggest media scandals, due principally to the upcoming election for President in April 1925. Ebert was a formidable contender for re-election and the right-wing press saw an opportunity in Barmat to score political points. Ebert had died and Braun was the SPD candidate.
The Barman Scandal was bandied about in the press in preparation for the Presidential election and it also appeared as a topic at right-wing political rallies. The right-wing Nationalpost stated the theme: The Barmat scandal was not just a tale of corruption within the Prussian State Bank or the Postal Ministry. It was rather a scandal of Social Democracy itself. Leading Social Democrats, it contended, had improperly used political influence to secure favorable treatment (such as loans and contracts) for the Barmats, in exchange for payments and other financial benefits that flowed both to themselves individually as well as to the party.
Political leaflets were distributed throughout the countryside based on the history of the scandal.
No candidate secured a majority in the first round of elections, so under the Weimar Constitution a second round of elections had to be conducted. In this round, the SPD aligned with the Center through a political deal: the SPD candidate Braun withdrew from the Presidential race and was elected president of Prussia on 3 April 1925 with the Center's support; and in return the SPD supported Marx (the Center party candidate) for Reich President.
At this point the right-wing abandoned its first-round candidate Jarres and instead offered up General Paul von Hindenburg as its candidate. The right-wing Reichsblock called the Center-SPD coalition the Barmatblock, and leaflets and pamphlets that painted the center-leftist coalition with the Barmat scandal were distributed widely throughout Germany.
Hindenburg won on April 26 by a margin of 900,000 votes, largely as a result of his appeal to new voters who had stayed home in the first round. He had campaigned on the basis of restoring non-partisanship to the Presidential office and of a general restoration of social harmony. The press campaign was a key in this close election, as Fulda observed (p. 104): The key to success lay in the mobilization of former non-voters, and their dissatisfaction with the present system... Hindenburg [might not have scraped into office without four months of media barrage aimed at discrediting the Republic.
Sentencing.
Due to the fine work from detective Gustav Hijazie the Barmat brothers were arrested and sent to be sentenced. In early 1928 Julius and Henri Barmat were sentenced to 11 months and 6 months imprisonment for bribery, respectively.

Porsche 911 classic

The original Porsche 911 (pronounced "nine eleven", ) was a luxury sports car made by Porsche AG of Stuttgart, Germany. The famous, distinctive, and durable design was introduced in autumn 1963 and built through 1989. It was succeeded by a modified version, internally referred to as Porsche 964 but still sold as "Porsche 911", as are current models.
Mechanically, the 911 was notable for being rear engined and air-cooled. From its inception the 911 was modified both by private teams and the factory itself for racing, rallying and other types of automotive competition. The original 911 series is often cited as the most successful competition car ever, especially when its variations are included, mainly the powerful 911-derived 935 which won 24 Hours of Le Mans and other major sports cars races outright against prototypes.
Introduction.
The Porsche 911 was developed as a much more powerful, larger, more comfortable replacement for the Porsche 356, the company's first model, and essentially a sporting evolution of the Volkswagen Beetle. The new car made its public debut at the 1963 Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung, better known to English speakers as the Frankfurt Motor Show.
It was initially designated as the "Porsche 901", after its internal project number. However, Peugeot protested on the grounds that in France it had exclusive rights to car names formed by three numbers with a zero in the middle. So, instead of selling the new model with another name in France, Porsche changed the name to 911. It went on sale in 1964.
2.0-litre / O, A and B series (1964–1969).
The earliest editions of the 911 had a flat-6 engine, in the "boxer" configuration like the 356, air-cooled and rear-mounted, displaced 1991 cc compared with the 356's four-cylinder, 1600 cc unit. The car had four seats although the rear seats are very small, and the car is usually called a 2+2 rather than a four-seater (the 356 was also a 2+2). It was mated to a five-speed manual "Type 901" transmission. The styling was largely by Ferdinand "Butzi" Porsche, son of Ferdinand "Ferry" Porsche. Erwin Komenda, the leader of the Porsche car body construction department, was also involved in the design.
The 356 came to the end of its production life in 1965, but there was still a market for a 4-cylinder car, particularly in the USA. The Porsche 912, introduced the same year, served as a direct replacement. It used the 356's 4-cylinder, 1600 cc, engine but wore the 911 bodywork.
In 1966 Porsche introduced the more powerful 911S, the engine's power raised to . Alloy wheels from Fuchs, in a distinctive 5-leaf design, were offered for the first time. In motorsport at the same time, installed in the mid-engined Porsche 904 and Porsche 906, the engine was developed to 210 PS (154 kW).
In 1967 the Targa version was introduced as a "stop gap" model. The Targa had a stainless steel-clad roll bar, as Porsche had, at one point, thought that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) would outlaw fully open convertibles in the US, an important market for the 911. The name "Targa" (which means "shield" in Italian) came from the Targa Florio sports car road race in Sicily, Italy in which Porsche had notable success, with seven victories since 1956, and four more to come until 1973. This last win in the subsequently discontinued event is especially notable as it was scored with a 911 Carrera RS against prototypes entered by Italian factories of Ferrari and Alfa Romeo. The road going Targa was equipped with a removable roof panel and a removable plastic rear window (although a fixed glass version was offered alongside from 1968).
The 911T was also launched in 1967 and effectively replaced the 912. The staple model was renamed the 911L. The 911R had a very limited production (20 in all). This was a lightweight racing version with thin aluminium doors, a magnesium crankcase, twin-spark cylinder heads, and a power output of .
In 1969 the B series was introduced: the wheelbase for all 911 and 912 models was increased from , an effective remedy to the car's nervous handling at the limit. The overall length of the car did not change: rather, the rear wheels were relocated aft. Fuel injection arrived for the 911S and for a new middle model, 911E. A semi-automatic Sportomatic model, composed of a torque converter, an automatic clutch, and the four-speed transmission, was added to the product lineup.
B17 (1969).
It is a concept designed by Pininfarina by lengthening the wheelbase by , resulting in a car heavier than original.
2.2-litre / C and D series (1969–1971).
For MY 1970 the engines of all 911s were increased to . Power outputs were uprated to in the 911T, in the 911E, and in the 911S. The 912 was discontinued, thanks to the introduction of the Porsche 911T as an entry model.
The 2.2 L 911E was called "The secret weapon from Zuffenhausen". Despite the lower power output of the 911E compared to the 911S, the 911E was quicker in acceleration up to .
C 20 (1970).
It was a prototype extended by over stock car, with 911S engine.
2.4-litre / E and F series (1971–1973).
The 1972–1973 model years consisted of the same models of 911— the entry level T, the midrange E and the top of the line S. However, all models got a new, larger engine. This is universally known as the "2.4L" engine, despite its displacement being closer to 2.3 litres— perhaps to emphasize the increase over the 2.2 L. The new power ratings were , or in the U.S., for the T, for the E and for the S.
The 911E and 911S used mechanical fuel injection (MFI) in all markets. The 911T was carbureted, except in the US where it also used MFI, which accounts for the power difference between the two. In January, 1973, US 911Ts were switched to the new K-Jetronic CIS (Continuous Fuel Injection) system from Bosch. These CIS-powered cars are usually referred to as "1973.5" models by enthusiasts.
With the power and torque increases, the 2.4 L cars also got a newer, stronger transmission, identified by its Porsche type number 915. Derived from the transmission in the Porsche 908 race car, the 915 did away with the 901/911 transmission's "dog-leg" style first gear arrangement, opting for a traditional H pattern with first gear up to the left, second gear underneath first, etc. Some say this was because the dog-leg shift to second gear was inconvenient for city driving, other say it was due to Porsche’s desire to put 5th gear outside the main transmission housing where it could easily be changed for different races. The Sportomatic transmission was still available but only as a special order.
In 1972 a tremendous effort was made to improve the handling of the 911. Due to the 911's unusual engine placement (rear-mounted, with most of the vehicle's weight concentrated over the rear axle) early 911's were prone to oversteer when driven at the limit, and could easily spin in the hands of an inexperienced driver. In an attempt to remedy this, Porsche relocated the oil tank from its position behind the right rear wheel to in front of it. This had the effect of moving the weight of almost 9 quarts (8.5 L) of oil from outside the wheelbase to inside, improving weight distribution and thus, handling. To facilitate filling of the oil tank, Porsche installed an oil filler door (much like the fuel filler door on the left front fender) on the right rear quarter panel. Unfortunately, this unique design was scrapped after only one year, some say because inattentive gas station attendants were putting gas in the oil tank. The oil tank was subsequently moved back to its original position for model year 1973, and remained there until it was moved back within the wheelbase for the 964 models.
911S models also gained a discreet spoiler under the front bumper to improve high-speed stability. With the car's weight only 1050 kg (2315 lb), these are often regarded as the best classic mainstream 911s. For racing at this time, the 911 ST was produced in limited numbers (the production run for the ST only lasted from 1970 to 1971.) The cars were available with engines of either 2466 cc or 2492 cc, producing 270 PS (199 kW) at 8000 rpm. Weight was down to 960 kg (2166 lb). The cars had success at the Daytona 6 Hours, the Sebring 12 Hours, the 1000 km Nürburgring and the Targa Florio.
Carrera RS (1973 and 1974).
These models, valued by collectors, are considered by many to be the greatest classic 911s of all-time. RS stands for "Rennsport" in German, meaning "racing sport". The Carrera name was reintroduced from the 356 Carrera which had itself been named after Porsche's victories in the Carrera Panamericana races in Mexico in the 1950s. The RS was built so that Porsche could enter racing formulae that demanded that a certain minimum number of production cars were made. Compared with a standard 911S, the Carrera 2.7 RS had a larger engine (2687 cc) developing with MFI, revised and stiffened suspension, a "ducktail" rear spoiler, larger brakes, wider rear wheels and rear wings. In RS Touring form it weighed 1075 kg (2370 lb), in Sport Lightweight form it was about 100 kg (220 lb) lighter, the saving coming from the thin-gauge steel used for parts of the bodyshell and also the use of thinner glass. In total, 1580 were made, comfortably exceeding the 500 that had to be made to qualify for the vital FIA Group 4 class. 49 Carrera RS cars were built with 2808 cc engines producing 300 PS (221 kW).
In 1974, Porsche created the Carrera RS 3.0 with K-Jetronic Bosch fuel injection producing 230 PS (169 kW).It was almost twice as expensive as the 2.7 RS but offered a fair amount of racing capability for that price. The chassis was largely similar to that of the 1973 Carrera RSR and the brake system was from the Porsche 917. The use of thin metal plate panels and a spartan interior enabled the shipping weight to be reduced to around 900 kg (1984 lb).
The Carrera RSR 3.0 and Carrera RSR Turbo (its 2.1 L engine due to a 1.4x equivalency formula) were made in tiny numbers for racing. The turbo car came second at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1974, a significant event in that its engine would form the basis of many future Porsche attempts in sportscar racing, and can be regarded as the start of its commitment to turbocharging.
2.7-litre / G, H, I and J series (1974–1977).
The new impact bumper.
MY 1974 was the introduction of impact bumpers to conform with low speed protection requirements of US law, these bumpers being so successfully integrated into the design that they remained unchanged for 15 years. In 1974 the engine size was increased to 2687 cc giving an increase in torque. The use of K-Jetronic CIS Bosch fuel injection in two of the three models in the line up— the 911 and 911S models, retaining the narrow rear wings of the old 2.4, now had a detuned version of the RS engine producing 150 and 175 PS (110 and 129 kW) respectively.
Carrera 2.7 / G and H (1974-1975).
The Carrera 2.7, now a regular production model, inherited the wider rear wings of the RS together with its 210 PS (154 kW) MFI engine and was indeed mechanically identical to the 1973 RS and still weighed the same at 1075 kg (2370 lb). All three models were given high backed front seats.
The 930 Turbo was introduced in 1975 (see below).
The Carrera 3.0 was introduced in 1976 with what was essentially the Turbo's 2994 cc engine minus the turbocharger, and with K-Jetronic CIS although now developing 200 PS (147 kW).
The well known problem of pulled cylinder head studs with the K-Jetronic 2.7 engine only occurred in hot climates. This emerged in 1975 in California where thermal reactors, aimed at reducing emissions, were fitted below the cylinder heads thus causing heat build up around the magnesium crankcase and then made worse by the lean running K-Jetronic CIS. The fitting of a 5-blade engine fan instead of the usual 11-blade further compounded the situation.
Bearing in mind Porsche's largest market being the USA, the 930 Turbo, Carrera 3.0 and all subsequent models used aluminium alloy crankcases which were around heavier.
The Bosch K-Jetronic CIS varied fuel pressure to the injectors dependent on the mass airflow. While this system was exceedingly reliable, it did not allow the use of as "hot" cams as MFI or carburettors allowed. Therefore the 911S's horsepower decreased from 190 to 175 PS (140–128 kW) despite the displacement increase from 2.4 to 2.7 L. However, the engine did have increased drivability.
The 210 PS (154 kW) Carrera 2.7 with MFI was not sold in the US owing to emission regulations— instead they received a 'Carrera' fitted with a 911S engine producing , later reduced to 165 (121 kW), and in California even down to 160 PS (118 kW).
Also produced for the 1976 "model year", for the U.S. market, was the 912E, a 4-cylinder version of the 911 like the 912 that had last been produced in 1969. It used the I-series chassis and the 2.0 Volkswagen engine from the Porsche 914. In all, 2099 units were produced. In 1976 the Porsche 924 took this car's place for the 1977 "model year" and beyond. The power was supplied by a 4-cylinder high-performance fuel injection motor also used in the 411 Volkswagen. Less than 6000 were built.
Carrera 3.0 (1976–1977).
The Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0 brought together elements from two of Porsche’s most legendary cars. It represented the latest incarnation of the Porsche Carrera, originally introduced to the 911 series as the classic 2.7 litre RS in late 1972, and the Carrera 3′s 2993cc engine used the same die-cast aluminium crank-case as its awesome cousin, the newly introduced Porsche 930 or ’911 Turbo’.
During its short two year life span, only 3687 cars were built. Of these 2564 were coupes and only 1123 produced in Targa format, and only a very small number were manufactured in RHD. It was donned with the prestigious Porsche ‘Carrera’ label. Carrera is a trademarked name (Spanish for ‘Race’) exclusively used by Porsche for some of its models to honor the company’s success in the Carrera Panamericana.
For its time the Carrera 3.0 was an extremely powerful sports car. Its 3 litre horizontally opposed, air cooled engine, using Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection, produced 200 bhp at 6000 rpm and 188 lb/ft of torque at 4200 rpm. The car was offered with either a 4 or 5 speed version of Porsche’s 915 manual gearbox.
Turbo (Type 930) (1974–1989).
In 1974 Porsche introduced the first production turbocharged 911. Although called simply Porsche 911 Turbo in Europe, it was marketed as Porsche 930 (930 being its internal type number) in North America. The body shape is distinctive, thanks to wide wheel-arches to accommodate the wide tires, and a large rear spoiler often known as a "whale tail" on the early cars, and "tea-tray" on the later ones. Starting out with a 3.0 L engine , it rose to 3.3 L for 1978. The early cars are known for their exhilarating acceleration coupled with challenging handling characteristics and extreme turbo lag.
Production figures of the car soon qualified its racing version for FIA Group 4 competition as the Porsche 934 of 1976. Many participated at Le Mans and other races including some epic battles with the BMW 3.0 CSL "Batmobile". The wilder Porsche 935, a finer tuned car in FIA Group 5 and evolved from the 2.1 L RSR Turbo of 1974, was campaigned in 1976 by the factory and won Le Mans in 1979. Private teams continued to compete successfully with the car until well into the 1980s.
Due to ever more draconian emissions regulations, the 930 was withheld from the important US and Japanese markets from 1981 through 1985. In the same time period, Porsche was involved in several wrongful death lawsuits in California related to the 930, even involving privately imported European market 930's. It was finally re-introduced into the United States in 1986.
As demand for the Turbo soared in the late 1980s, Porsche introduced novelty variants including a slant-nose version (option M505/M506), while not significantly improving the range mechanically. Although these cars could be sold for extraordinary premiums over the standard models, the company's reluctance to invest in research and development of the entire 911 line at that time turned out to be an almost fatal decision not only for the 911, but for the company.
Only in 1989, its last year of production, was the 930 equipped with a five-speed gearbox. The 930 was replaced in 1990 with a 964 version featuring the same 3.3 L engine.
There have been turbocharged variants of each subsequent generation of 911.
SC / L, M, A, B, C and D series (1978–1983).
Starting in MY 1978, the new 3.0 L 911 SC (2994 cc) was now the basic 911 model. It was in effect a Carrera 3 (known as a 911S in the US) detuned to provide 180 PS (132 kW). The "SC" designation was reintroduced by Porsche for the first time since the 356 SC (as distinguished from the race-engined 356 Carrera). No Carrera versions were produced and the 930 Turbo remaining at the top of the range. Porsche’s engineers felt that the weight of the extra luxury, safety and emissions equipment on these cars was blunting performance compared to the earlier, lighter cars with the same power output, so in non-US cars, power was increased to 188 PS (138 kW) for 1980, then finally to 204 PS (150 kW). However, cars sold in the US market retained their lower-compression 180 PS engines throughout. This enabled them to be run on lower-octane fuel.
In model year 1980, Porsche offered a Weissach special edition version of the 911 SC, named after the town in Germany where Porsche has their research center. Designated M439, it was offered in two colors with the turbo whale tail & front chin spoiler, body color-matched Fuchs alloy wheels and other convenience features as standard. 408 cars were built for North America. In 1982, a Ferry Porsche Edition was made and a total of 200 cars were sold with this cosmetic package.
SCs sold in the UK could be specified with the Sport Group Package (UK) which added stiffer suspension, the rear spoiler, front rubber lip and black Fuchs wheels.
In 1981 a Cabriolet concept car was shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show. Not only was the car a true convertible, but it also featured four-wheel drive, although this was dropped in the production version. The first 911 Cabriolet debuted in late 1982, as a 1983 model. This was Porsche’s first cabriolet since the 356 of the mid-1960s. It proved very popular with 4,214 sold in its introductory year, despite its premium price relative to the open-top targa. Cabriolet versions of the 911 have been offered ever since.
It was during this time, that Porsche AG decided the long-term fate of the 911. In 1979 Porsche had made plans to replace the 911 with their new 928. Sales of the 911 remained so strong however, that Porsche revised its strategy and decided to inject new life into the 911 editions.
Peter W. Schutz (CEO Porsche AG 1981-1987) wrote:
"“The decision to keep the 911 in the product line occurred one afternoon in the office of Dr Helmuth Bott :de:Helmuth Bott, the Porsche operating board member responsible for all engineering and development. I noticed a chart on the wall of Professor Bott’s office. It depicted the ongoing development schedules for the three primary Porsche product lines: 944, 928 and 911. Two of them stretched far into the future, but the 911 program stopped at the end of 1981. I remember rising from my chair, walking over to the chart, taking a black marker pen, and extending the 911 program bar clean off the chart. I am sure I heard a silent cheer from Professor Bott, and I knew I had done the right thing. The Porsche 911, the company icon, had been saved, and I believe the company was saved with it.”"
911 SC sales totaled 58,914 cars.
3.2 Carrera / E, F, G, H, I, J and K series (1984–1989).
With the 911’s future assured, 1983 saw the launch of a replacement for the successful SC series. It was the MY 1984 911 3.2 Carrera, reviving the Carrera name for the first time since 1975. The 911 3.2 Carrera was the last iteration in the original 911 series, with all subsequent models featuring new body styling with new brake, electronic and suspension technologies.
A new, higher-displacement motor, a 3.2-liter horizontally opposed flat 6 cylinder, was utilized. At the time, Porsche claimed it was 80% new. The new swept volume of 3164 cc was achieved using the bore (from the previous SC model) combined with the 1978 Turbo 3.3 crankshaft's stroke. In addition, higher domed pistons increased the compression ratio from 9.8 to 10.3:1 (although only 9.5:1 for the US market). New inlet manifold and exhaust systems were fitted. The 915 transmission was carried over from the SC series for the first three model years. In 1987, the Carrera got a new five-speed gearbox sourced from Getrag, model number G50 with proven Borg-Warner synchronizers. This slightly heavier version also featured a hydraulically operated clutch.
With the new engine, power was increased to at 5900 rpm for North American-delivered cars and to at 5900 rpm for most other markets. This version of the 911 accelerated 0– in 5.4 seconds and had a top speed of as measured by Autocar. Factory times were more modest: 0-60 mph time of 6.3 seconds for the US version and 6.1 seconds for cars outside the American market.
The disc brakes were increased in size to aid in more effective heat dissipation and improved oil-fed chain tensioners were fitted to the engine. To improve oil cooling, a finned cooler replaced the serpentine lines in the front passenger fender well. This was further improved in 1987, with the addition of a thermostatically controlled fan.
Driving refinement and motor reliability were improved with an upgrade of the fuel and ignition control components to a L-Jetronic with Bosch Motronics 2 DME (Digital Motor Electronics system). An improvement in fuel-efficiency was due to the DME providing a petrol cut-off on the overrun. Changes in the fuel map & chip programming from October 1986, further improved the power to at 5900 rpm for North American delivered cars as well as for other markets requesting low emissions, like Germany. Custom-mapped chips remain a popular upgrade. The fuel relay that is mounted externally on the DME is known to be a weak point of the system.
Three basic models were available throughout the Carrera years – coupe, targa and cabriolet. When launched in 1984 in the United States, the prices of the 911 Carrera lineup were $31,950 for the coupe, $33,450 for the targa and $36,450 for the cabriolet. Almost indistinguishable from the SC, external clues are the front fog lights, which were integrated into the front valance in the Carrera. Very modest cosmetic changes were made throughout the lifespan of the Carrera, with a redesigned dash featuring larger air conditioning vents appearing in 1986.
Two special editions of the Carrera were produced – the "Commemorative Edition" in 1988 to commemorate 250,000 911s produced and an "Anniversary" edition in 1989 which was the model’s 25th year of production. Both were cosmetic packages with limited production.
In 1984, Porsche also introduced the M491 option. Officially called the Supersport, it was commonly known as the "Turbo-look". It was a style that resembled the Porsche 930 Turbo with wide wheel arches and the distinctive "tea tray” tail. It featured the stiffer turbo suspension and the superior turbo braking system as well as the wider turbo wheels. Sales of the Supersport were particularly strong for its first two years in the United States because the desirable 930 was not available.
The 911 Speedster (option M503), a low-roof version of the Cabriolet which was evocative of the Porsche 356 Speedster of the 1950s, was produced in limited numbers (2104) between January 1989 and July 1989 as both a narrow body car and a Turbo-look, which also featured 930 brakes, wheels, suspension, and front valence.
171 narrow body examples were built, and 823 examples were built for the US market. It started as a design under Helmuth Bott in 1983 but was not manufactured until six years later. It was a two-seat convertible that featured a low swept windshield.
The 1987 Carrera Club Sport, of which 340 were produced, is a collectible 911 that had a blueprinted engine with a higher rev limit, and had the electric windows, electric seats, and radio removed to save a claimed 50 kg (110 lb) in weight.
Total production of the 911 3.2 Carrera series was 76,473 cars (35,670 coupé, 19,987 cabrio, 18,468 targa).
In late 1989, the 911 underwent a major evolution, with the introduction of the Type Porsche 964 (1989–1993).
Position vis-à-vis the Porsche 928.
When 911 sales began to decline by the early 1970s, Porsche executives approved work on the Porsche 928 in 1971. Larger, and featuring a front-mounted V8 engine considerably more powerful than the contemporary 911's flat six, the 928 was intended to be a comfortable grand tourer rather than a dedicated sports car. Capable of out-accelerating and even matching or exceeding the 911's cornering prowess in some model years, the 928 sold reasonably well from its introduction in 1977 until its discontinuation in 1995. In spite of its overall capability, it never outsold the 911; and unlike its smaller, sportier sibling, it achieved little success in racing.
Motorsport.
The Porsche factory's first 911-based race car was a lightly modified 1964 Type 901. It finished fifth in the 1965 Monte Carlo Rally and is now housed in the Porsche Museum. 
Porsche 911s dominated the Trans Am Series under two liter class in the sixties, winning the championship from 1967-1969. They would later go on to win the championship in 1973, 1974, and 1980. Despite Trans Am being a sedan championship in its early years, the Porsche 911 was a sports car. Its inclusion is likely due to its resemblance to a coupe.

Ban Hin Taek

Ban Hin Taek or Baan Hin Taek (Thai: ที่บ้านหินแตก, lit. "The Village of Broken Stone") now renamed Ban Therd Thai – “Village to Honour Thailand”, is a village found in the Chiang Rai area in the northern part of Thailand. This village, composed mainly of Akha people, has had a very vivid history involving the notorious drug leader known as Khun Sa. Despite being called Ban Therd Thai, the village will be referred to as Ban Hin Taek which is the name the villagers refer to when talking about their village.
Origins and Directions.
Ban Hin Taek is more specifically located beyond Doi Mae Salong in Northern Thailand. It is just south of the Thai-Burma border located in the Golden Triangle. In order to reach Ban Hin Taek, one must take the road which starts at Bap Basang on Route 110 between Chiang Rai and Mae Sai. A road by the name of Route 1130 goes west into the mountains where its final destination is Doi Mae Salong. The road eventually becomes Route 1234, a surfaced road. If you go further along this road, you will come across a dirt road going north towards the Burmese border. This is the road that will take you to Ban Hin Taek.
Ban Hin Taek is a village nestled in a valley which is “like a finger pointing” into the Shan State. It is surrounded by hills that have been scarred by slash-and-burn agriculture. From Ban Hin Taek you can see the summit of Doi Tung, a mountain approximately 1322 metres high. 
Ban Hin Taek is not as small a village as one would think. Its inhabitants have expanded the village along a road for more than 3 kilometres towards the Burmese border. It has become quite prosperous over the years mainly because of agricultural trade, but also because of the drug trade that existed for some time in Ban Hin Taek.
History.
It is believed that Ban Hin Taek was the first Akha village in Thailand. It was founded in 1903 when the Akha entered Thailand from the easternmost Shan states of Burma. From that point onward we know very little of the happenings in Ban Hin Taek. Once Khun Sa appeared in Ban Hin Taek, we have an inflow of articles concerning Ban Hin Taek and his involvement with it. 
“Ban Hin Taek's village headman Duangdee Khemmawongse recalls, ‘Khun Sa came to live at Ban Hin Taek in late 1964, when he was around 30 and left a year later. In 1976, he came back again with his wife and children.’” In 1974, Khun Sa was released from Burmese prison he set up his base 2 years later in Ban Hin Taek. As long as the Thai generals were getting some of the drug revenues, Khun Sa could keep operating in Ban Hin Taek. Khun Sa was also beneficial to the Thai because they hoped to topple the Kuomintang (KMT) and Rangoon’s hold on northeastern Burma so that Thailand could become more influential in that area. At this point in time, Khun Sa appointed himself as liberator of the Shan people advocating for a separate Shan state within Burma. He also agreed to “suppress the Beijing-backed Burmese Communist and Thai Communist Parties” which at the time were very active in that area.
Khun Sa ended up becoming a very successful drug warlord in the years 1974-1982. Once the communists came to power in both Laos and South Vietnam in 1975, Khun Sa was able to get a much stronger hold over the drug trade as the KMT’s smuggling routes in the area were now disrupted. With all this newfound wealth came newfound power, and Khun Sa needed a way to secure and protect his power. Thus he set up the Shan United Army (SUA) which at its peak had 20 000 soldiers. Khun Sa’s drug empire continued to grow until the early 1980s when the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) estimated that “70% of heroin consumed in the USA came from his organization.” Thus, the DEA decided to take action.
Before we look at the DEA’s involvement with Khun Sa, let us look at the benefits Ban Hin Taek got from Khun Sa. While he used the village as a base, it did not mean that he didn’t give back to the community. In fact, Khun Sa built health centers, schools and was the major benefactor of the Da Tong Chinese school which the KMT had set up. According to Apinan Apinanderthai, the kamnan of tambon Therd Thai, the villagers “called Khun Sa chao oo, or father.”
However, Khun Sa’s generosity came to an end when the Thai government suddenly changed hands from General Kriangsak Chomanan to General Prem Tinsulanonda. The new general, along with pressure from the DEA who were trying to stop the flow of heroin into the United States (US), decided to kick Khun Sa out of Thailand. Thus, in January 1982, the Thai army, in conjunction with the Border Patrol Police, launched an offensive against Khun Sa’s base in Ban Hin Taek. Many days of violent fighting ensued and eventually the Thai forces used tanks and planes to get the SUA forces to retreat into Burma. Khun Sa managed to escape beforehand to the town of Hua Muang across the Burmese border. This signaled the end of Khun Sa’s drug regime in Ban Hin Taek.
Unfortunately this was not the end of Ban Hin Taek’s involvement in drug trafficking. In recent years, the heroin trade has been replaced with methamphetamines. Ban Hin Taek recently has fallen prey to drug traffickers who operate from across the Burmese border. It has been reported that the traffickers bribed local authorities and that four local residents have been killed by the gangs – “Two were eliminated because they tried to turn their backs on the drug trade, and two others because they were being uncooperative.”
Burma decided to take action against this new development and started shelling the border in February 2001. Soon after they also shelled the outskirts of Ban Hin Taek. This wasn’t the end of the new Burmese offensive. In March 2001 Burma prepared more troops and set up for further artillery strikes. As a result, Thai officials were ready to evacuate the villages along the Burmese border to Ban Therd Thai in order to secure their safety. However, there is no evidence that the Burmese military took any further action at this time.
The latest news coming out of Ban Hin Taek since 2001 was, when on October 26, 2007, Khun Sa died. A funeral was arranged for Khun Sa in order to commemorate his death, but to also attract tourism to the village. From this point on, investors have approached the village trying to develop it and attract tourists to the area.
Economy.
One would think that the drug trade is the sole factor for the development of Ban Hin Taek. However, this is not entirely true. Ban Hin Taek has a long custom of an agriculture industry. This is the local’s main source of income as they never really had a hand in the drug trade unless they directly worked for Khun Sa. Produce such as tomatoes, maize, onions, garlic and potatoes are grown and then sold in other places in Chiang Rai. There is even a tea factory in the village.
Ban Hin Taek also has a prosperous cross-border trade. Most of this trade is legal, but the villagers who dally in the drug trade always have to be careful of their illegal actions. As mentioned above, the drug trade allowed Khun Sa to build schools and other public facilities which helped the economic situation of the village.
Since Khun Sa was expelled from Ban Hin Taek, the village slowly started building a tourist industry. The plan was to turn Khun Sa’s old house into a museum and create new jobs for the locals. “However, local authorities are still reluctant to agree to the idea, fearing the village’s history will be distorted by investors, who may focus only on their own benefits.” Nevertheless, the village now hosts a resort where people can relax by a stream or go mountain biking in the beautiful mountains around Ban Hin Taek. The renovation of Khun Sa’s house was completed and has become a museum. 
The most recent news concerning the tourist industry in Ban Hin Taek was in 2007 when the village committee set up a development plan for the village. Resort hotels were to be built in order to accommodate tourists. The committee still fears that investors will abuse Ban Hin Taek, forgoing all of its cultural diversity and customs in favour of profits. Nevertheless, Ban Hin Taek has a growing tourist industry based on its fascinating past.
Culture.
Ban Hin Taek population of approximately 3000 people is very ethnically diverse consisting of Shan, Yunnanese, Akha, Lisu, Lahu, and other tribespeople. The Akha, who were the founders of Ban Hin Taek as stated earlier, are the predominant tribe.
The Akha women wear much silver and often wear striped leggings in order to carry firewood and dry goods up to their homes. The houses in Ban Hin Taek are not built in an Akha style, but instead show signs of Yunnanese influence. They are built of wattle and mud on solid ground instead of the commonly found houses built on stilts. 
“With local corn whisky on sale as a substitute for the eliminated opium crop, other products found include Chinese herb remedies, Khanom Jiin curry and Chinese teas.” The diversity of food, drink and herbal remedies just highlights the mixture of the numerous different cultures that exist in Ban Hin Taek.
The abundant religions practiced by the villagers are probably the best example to highlight the cultural diversity of Ban Hin Taek. There is a Thai Buddhist wat on the northeastern edge of the village, a mosque on the western front and a little ways out of Ban Hin Taek, a large Chinese temple resides. Thus, there are many religious places of worship to satisfy most of Ban Hin Taek’s villagers.
Finally, every year Ban Hin Taek celebrates the Songkran Festival. This is less of a cultural tradition than a national tradition, but a tradition nonetheless.
Political and Societal significance.
Ban Hin Taek is of great political significance. For a long time the route from Ban Hin Taek to Burma was used to enter or leave Burma illegally. Once Khun Sa got involved with this village, it suddenly came under the radar of the Thai, KMT and the DEA. Ban Hin Taek was used to smuggle drugs and as Khun Sa’s base. This is the village where the once dubbed “King of Opium” ruled over his drug regime and created the SUA. Eventually Khun Sa was kicked out of Thailand and the drug trafficking subsided along with the political significance of Ban Hin Taek. However, there is no doubt that Khun Sa left his mark on this village.
Ban Hin Taek is also a great example of a wide range of cultures being able to live in peace and harmony. There is no evidence of violence and discrimination against specific ethnic groups by any of the villagers. It is a tightly knit village where people know each other for who they are. Some villagers knew Khun Sa as a neighbor, never getting involved in his affairs, but they developed their own image of Khun Sa, one where he is not the “King of Opium”, but rather a friendly villager. Ban Hin Taek is what it is. A culturally diverse village located in one of remotest parts of Thailand surrounded by unprecedented natural beauty.

Phoenicis Lacus quadrangle

The Phoenicis Lacus quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Phoenicis Lacus quadrangle is also referred to as MC-17 (Mars Chart-17).
The Phoenicis Lacus quadrangle covers the area from 90° to 135° west longitude and 0° to 30° south latitude on Mars. The Tharsus rise, which was formed from lava flows, occupies part of area. The volcanoes Pavonis Mons and Arsia Mons are believed to have once had glaciers on them. Glaciers may still exist under a thin layer of rocks. The ice can be a source of water for the possible future colonization of the planet. One of the most prominent features of this quadrangle is a large intersecting set of canyons called Noctis Labyrinthus. Other interesting features are lava channels, Dark slope streaks, pit crater chains, and large troughs (called fossae). Research published in the journal Icarus has found pits in Zumba Crater are caused by hot ejecta falling on ground containing ice. The pits are formed by heat forming steam that rushes out from groups of pits simultaneously, thereby blowing away from the pit ejecta.
Noctis Labyrinthus.
Noctis Labyrinthus is a large canyon system found in the Phoenicis Lacus quadrangle. Its walls contain many layers of rocks. Research, described in December 2009, found a variety of minerals—including clays, sulfates, and hydrated silicas in some of the layers.
Lava channels.
Lava sometimes forms a tube as it moves away from the vent (opening from which lava flows from a volcano). The top of a stream of lava cools down, thereby forming a solid roof. Meanwhile, the lava continues moving in the tube. Often, when all the lava leaves the tube, the roof collapses, making a channel. These features are found on Mars. Some can be seen around Pavonis Mons, in the picture below. Some people have suggested that future colonists on Mars could use lava tunnels as shelters. They would offer great protection from radiation, especially ultraviolet radiation. Lava Channels on the flank of the volcano Pavonis Mons are pictured below in a picture from Mars Odyssey THEMIS. Sometimes the lava tube remains intact for a time. Lava will break out along the tube to accumulate or flow away. Lava flows often have a lobate appearance at the edges. A good view of such a lava tube is shown below.
Glaciers.
Many of the volcanoes on Mars show strong evidence of past and possible present glacial activity. When glaciers melt and retreat, they leave behind material that was carried in and on the ice. Often the material is dropped in a ridge, called a moraine. An example of moraines is showed in the picture below from the flank of Arsia Mons, a picture taken with the Mars Odyssey THEMIS.
Dark slope streaks.
A picture below shows dark streaks on the slopes of Aganippe Fossa. Such streaks are common on Mars. They occur on steep slopes of craters, troughs, and valleys. The streaks are dark at first. They get lighter with age. Sometimes they start in a tiny spot, then spread out and go for hundreds of meters. They have been seen to travel around obstacles, like boulders. It is believed that they are avalanches of bright dust that expose a darker underlying layer. However, several ideas have been advanced to explain them. Some involve water or even the growth of organisms. The streaks appear in areas covered with dust. Much of the Martian surface is covered with dust. Fine dust settles out of the atmosphere covering everything. We know a lot about this dust because the solar panels of the Mars Rovers get covered with dust, thus reducing the electrical energy. The power of the Rovers has been restored many times by the wind, in the form of dust devils, cleaning the panels and boosting the power. So, we know that dust settles from the atmosphere then returns over and over. Dust storms are frequent, especially when the spring season begins in the southern hemisphere. At that time, Mars is 40% closer to the sun. The orbit of Mars is much more elliptical then the Earth's. That is the difference between the farthest point from the sun and the closest point to the sun is very great for Mars, but only a slight amount for the Earth. Also, every few years, the entire planet is engulfed in global dust storms. When NASA's Mariner 9 craft arrived there, nothing could be seen through the dust storm. Other global dust storms have also been observed, since that time.
Research, published in January 2012 in Icarus, found that dark streaks were initiated by airblasts from meteorites traveling at supersonic speeds. The team of scientists was led by Kaylan Burleigh, an undergraduate at the University of Arizona. After counting some 65,000 dark streaks around the impact site of a group of 5 new craters, patterns emerged. The number of streaks was greatest closer to the impact site. So, the impact somehow probably caused the streaks. Also, the distribution of the streaks formed a pattern with two wings extending from the impact site. The curved wings resembled scimitars, curved knives. This pattern suggests that an interaction of airblasts from the group of meteorites shook dust loose enough to start dust avalanches that formed the many dark streaks. At first it was thought that the shaking of the ground from the impact caused the dust avalanches, but if that was the case the dark streaks would have been arranged symmetrically around the impacts, rather than being concentrated into curved shapes.
The crater cluster lies near the equator 510 miles) south of Olympus Mons, on a type of terrain called the Medusae Fossae formation. The formation is coated with dust and contains wind-carved ridges called yardangs. These yardangs have steep slopes thickly covered with dust, so when the sonic boom of the airblast arrived from the impacts dust started to move down the slope.
Using photos from Mars Global Surveyor and HiRISE camera on NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, scientists have found about 20 new impacts each year on Mars. Because the spacecraft have been imaging Mars almost continuously for a span of 14 years, newer images with suspected recent craters can be compared to older images to determine when the craters were formed. Since the craters were spotted in a HiRISE image from February 2006, but were not present in a Mars Global Surveyor image taken in May 2004, the impact occurred in that time frame.
The largest crater in the cluster is about in diameter with close to the area of a basketball court. As the meteorite traveled through the Martian atmosphere it probably broke up; hence a tight group of impact craters resulted. 
Dark slope streaks have been seen for some time, and many ideas have been advanced to explain them. This research may have finally solved this mystery.
Pit crater chains.
Pit craters are common near volcanoes in the Tharsis and Elysium system of volcanoes. Pit craters form when a void is produced by a cracking of the surface caused by stretching. Also, lava may drain out of an underground chamber, thus leaving an empty space. When material slides into a void, a pit crater or a pit crater chain forms. Pit craters do not have rims or ejecta around them, like impact craters do. On Mars, individual pit craters can join to form chains or even to form troughs that are sometimes scalloped. Pit craters are not common on Earth. Sinkholes, where the ground falls into a hole (sometimes in the middle of a town) resemble pit craters on Mars. However, on the Earth these holes are caused by limestone being dissolved thereby causing a void. The image below of Arsia Chasmata contains a pit crater chain.
Fossa on Mars.
Certain areas on Mars possess large troughs (long narrow depressions) called fossae in the geographical language used for Mars. This term is derived from Latin; therefore fossa is singular and fossae is plural. Troughs form when the crust is stretched until it breaks. The stretching can be due to the large weight of a nearby volcano. Fossae/pit craters are common near volcanoes in the Tharsis and Elysium system of volcanoes. A trough often has two breaks with a middle section moving down, leaving steep cliffs along the sides; such a trough is called a graben. Lake George, in northern New York State, is a lake that sits in a graben.

Coprates quadrangle

The Coprates quadrangle goes from 45° to 90° west longitude and 0° to 30° south latitude on Mars. Coprates quadrangle is famous for depicting the "Grand Canyon of Mars", the Valles Marineris Canyon System. Signs of water exist in this quadrangle, with ancient river valleys and networks of stream channels showing up as inverted terrain and lakes inside of Valles Marineris. 
Valles Marineris Canyon System.
Valles Marineris is the largest canyon system in the solar system; this great canyon would go almost all the way across the United States. The name for the whole system of canyons is Valles Marineris. Starting at the west with Noctis Labyrinthus in the Phoenicis Lacus quadrangle, the canyon system ends in the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle with Capri Chasma and Eos Chasma (in the south). The word Chasma has been designated by the International Astronomical Union to refer to an elongate, steep-sided depression. Valles Marineris was discovered by and named for the Mariner 9 mission. Moving east from Noctis Labyrinthus, the canyon splits into two troughs, Tithonium Chasma and Ius Chasma (in the south). In the middle of the system are the very wide valleys of Ophir Chasma (north), Candor Chasma, and Melas Chasma (south). Going farther to the east, one comes to Coprates Chasma. At the end of Coprates Chasma, the valley gets wider to form Capri Chasma in the north and Eos Chasma in the south. The walls of the canyons often contain many layers. The floors of some of the canyons contain large deposits of layered materials. Some researchers believe that the layers were formed when water once filled the canyons. The canyons are deep as well as long. In places they are 8-10 kilometers deep. Remember the Earth's Grand Canyon is only 1.6 kilometers deep.
In a study published in the journal Geology in August 2009, a group of scientists led by John Adams of the University of Washington in Seattle proposed that Valles Marineris may have formed from a giant collapse when salts were heated up, thereby releasing water which rushed out carrying mud through underground plumbing. One point that supports this idea is that sulfate salts have been found in the area. These salts contain water which comes off when heated. Heat may have been generated by volcanic processes. After all, a number of huge volcanoes are nearby. Other ideas have been advanced by others to explain the origin of the system. 
Interior layered deposits and sulfate.
Parts of the floor of Candor Chasma contains layered deposits that have been termed interior layered deposits (ILD's). These layers may have formed when the whole area was a giant lake. However, many other ideas have been advanced to explain them. 
Some places on Mars contain hydrated sulfate deposits, including ILD's. Sulfate formation involves the presence of water. The European Space Agency's Mars Express found possible evidence of the sulfates epsomite and kieserite. Scientists want to visit these areas with robotic rovers.
These deposits have been found to contain ferric oxides in the form of crystalline grey hematite. 
Layers.
Images of rocks in the canyon walls almost always show layers. Some layers appear tougher than others. In the image below of Ganges Chasma Layers, as seen by HiRISE, one can see that the upper, light-toned deposits are eroding much faster than the lower darker layers. Some cliffs on Mars show a few darker layers standing out and often breaking into large pieces; these are thought to be hard volcanic rock instead of soft ash deposits. An example of hard layers is shown below in the picture of layers in the canyon wall in Coprates, as seen by Mars Global Surveyor. Because of its closeness to the Tharsis volcanic region, the rock layers may be made of layer after layer of lava flows, probably mixed with deposits of volcanic ash that fell out of the air following big eruptions. It is likely the rock strata in the walls preserve a long geological history of Mars. Dark layers may be due to dark lava flows. The dark volcanic rock basalt is common on Mars. However, light-toned deposits may have resulted from rivers, lakes, volcanic ash, or wind blown deposits of sand or dust. The Mars Rovers found light-toned rocks to contain sulfates. Probably having been formed in water, sulfate deposits are of great interest to scientists because they may contain traces of ancient life. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) instrument found opaline silica in certain strata along and within the Valles Marineris canyon system. Because Iron sulfates were sometimes found near the opaline silica, it is thought that the two deposits were formed with an acid fluid.
Herbes Chasma and hydrated deposits.
Herbes Chasma, a large enclosed valley, may have once held water. Hydrated minerals have been found there. It is thought that large-scale underground springs of groundwater at different times burst to the surface to form deposits called Light Toned Deposits (LTD's). Some suggest present or fossilized life forms may be found there because the deposits are relatively young.
Nirgal Vallis and sapping.
Nirgal Vallis is one of the longest valley networks on Mars. It is so large that it is found on more than one quadrangle. Scientists do not know how all the ancient river valleys were formed. There is evidence that instead of rain or snow, the water that formed the valleys originated underground. One mechanism that has been advanced is sapping. In sapping, the ground just gives away as water comes out. Sapping is common in some desert areas in America's Southwest. Sapping forms alcoves and stubby tributaries. These features are visible in the picture below of Nigal Vallis taken with Mars Odyssey's THEMIS.
Inverted relief.
Some areas of Mars show inverted relief, where features that were once depressions, like streams, are now instead above the surface. These may have been formed when materials, like large rocks, were deposited in low-lying areas, then left behind after erosion (perhaps wind which can not move large rocks) removed much of the surface layers. Other ways of making inverted relief might be lava flowing down a stream bed or materials being cemented by minerals dissolved in water. On Earth, materials cemented by silica are highly resistant to all kinds of erosional forces. Inverted relief in the shape of streams are further evidence of water flowing on the Martian surface in past times. There are many examples of inverted channels near Juventae Chasma; some are shown in the image of Juventae Chasma below.
Vallis.
Vallis (plural "valles") is the Latin word for "valley". It is used in planetary geology for the naming of landform features on other planets.
Vallis was used for old river valleys that were discovered on Mars, when probes were first sent to Mars. The Viking Orbiters caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars; huge river valleys were found in many areas. Space craft cameras showed that floods of water broke through dams, carved deep valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and traveled thousands of kilometers.

William Prowse

William Prowse CB (1752 – 23 March 1826) was an officer of the Royal Navy, who saw service during the American War of Independence, and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Rising from humble origins and joining the navy as an able seaman, he had a highly active career, serving under some of the most famous naval commanders of the age of sail, and participating in some of their greatest victories. He was at Grenada and Martinique under Byron and Rodney, the Glorious First of June under Howe; and commanded ships at Cape St Vincent under Jervis, Cape Finisterre under Calder and Trafalgar under Nelson. He finished his career by serving with distinction in the Mediterranean, and died with the rank of Rear-Admiral.
Family and early life.
Prowse appears to have been of very humble origins, little is known about his birth or childhood, but he appears to have been born to a working-class Devon family of Cornish origin in 1752. He probably went to sea aboard merchant ships initially, but is first recorded in the Navy on 13 November 1771 as an able seaman aboard the Hamoaze guardship, the 74-gun . Prowse remained aboard her for the next four years, only leaving her on 26 February 1776. His next posting was to the 74-gun , which he joined in November that year, being rated as midshipman and master's mate on 31 August 1778 by Captain George Bowyer. Prowse and the "Albion" were by then serving on the North American station, and went on to see action at the Battle of Grenada on 6 July 1779 and the
Battle of Martinique on 17 April 1780. Prowse was wounded in one of the clashes at Martinique, being struck in the head by a large splinter.
The "Albion" was paid off on 21 December 1781 and having passed his examination for lieutenancy on 17 January 1782 and by 6 December 1782 he had received his commission and was on 22 December 1782 appointed to the 90-gun second rate under Captain George Vandeput. Prowse was moved again on 14 April to join the 28-gun sixth rate under Captain Brabazon Christian. Prowse continued to serve off North America until March 1784. Prowse then disappears from naval records, and may have spent several years on merchant ships. He briefly reappears in 1787, when tensions with the Netherlands led to his return to service under his old patron Captain Bowyer, now serving on the 74-gun , but again left the service when the crisis had passed. The Nootka Sound crisis in 1790 led to another mobilisation of the fleet and Prowse returned to the navy, initially serving aboard the 98-gun and then aboard the 64-gun under Captain Robert Calder. The last few years of peace for Prowse were spent aboard Lord Hood's flagship at Portsmouth, the 90-gun , from August 1791 until January 1793.
French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.
The outbreak of war with France in February 1793 saw Prowse being appointed, on 20 March 1793, to the 90-gun , commanded by Captain Cuthbert Collingwood and flying the flag of Prowse's old commander, now Rear-Admiral Bowyer. He followed both Collingwood and Bowyer when they moved aboard Prowse's old ship the "Barfleur" on 28 December 1793, Prowse becoming the sixth lieutenant. The "Barfleur" went on to be part of Lord Howe's fleet, and was present at the Glorious First of June where Bowyer lost a leg, and Prowse too was wounded in the leg when a shot hit and dismounted the gun he was attempting to aim, and tore away part of his thigh. He apparently had to have his leg amputated.
[[File:Cleveley, Cape St Vincent.jpg|thumb|right|"The Battle of Cape St Vincent, 14 February 1797"
by Robert Cleveley. Prowse narrowly avoided being engaged by several Spanish ships of the line.]]
He was invalided ashore, but recovered quickly and returned to service aboard Robert Calder's 74-gun as his first lieutenant. Calder and the "Theseus" sailed to the West Indies and after carrying out several minor engagements with French shore batteries, returned to Britain as a convoy escort in July 1795. Calder and Prowse transferred aboard the 32-gun fifth rate and sailed to the Mediterranean to join Sir John Jervis aboard his flagship . Jervis appointed Prowse to his first independent command, the 14-gun sloop on 20 October 1796. "Raven" was with Jervis's fleet at the Battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797, and was used to repeat signals. She also, in company with four frigates and another sloop, gave chase to the Spanish four-decker "Santísima Trinidad" but they eventually lost her. For his services Jervis promoted Prowse to post-captain on 6 March 1797and appointed him to command the captured Spanish prize "Salvador del Mundo". Prowse took his ship home for paying-off in November but since no ship could be found for him, went on half-pay.
He finally returned to active service when Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Calder asked for him to be his flag-captain aboard his flagship . He briefly served in the West Indies, and returned to Britain on the Peace of Amiens in 1802. With the "Prince of Wales" paid off, Prowse was given command of the 36-gun frigate in August 1802, where he took part in the blockades of the French and Spanish coasts. With the resumption of the war in May 1803 "Sirius" was deployed into the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay, becoming part of Calder's fleet in 1804.
Battle of Cape Finisterre.
With Calder's fleet patrolling off Cape Finisterre in anticipation of the arrival of the combined Franco-Spanish fleet under Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, Prowse and the "Sirius", in company with HMS "Egyptienne" were despatched to scout for the enemy. Villeneuve had been reported as having arrived in the area and on 22 July Prowse located the allied feet, with the frigate "Siréne" at the rear, towing a captured merchant. Prowse closed on the "Siréne", intending to cut her off and board her, but Villeneuve ordered his ships to wear in succession and reverse their course to meet Calder's advancing fleet. Prowse suddenly found himself facing the entire combined fleet, which was fast bearing down on him, led by the Spanish Admiral Federico Gravina aboard the "Argonauta". With his tiny frigate heavily outclassed, Prowse began to beat away to leeward as the fleet passed him on the opposite tack. Gravina, aware of the convention that a ship of the line did not open fire on a frigate, ordered that the "Sirius" not be fired upon and the next Spanish ships also held fire. Shortly afterwards Calder's van came into range of the fleet and a general action ensued, whereby the "Sirius" was fired on by the "España" and had two men killed and three wounded. After the battle Prowse was sent to Plymouth with the captured Spanish 74-gun "Firme" in tow.
Nelson and Trafalgar.
Villeneuve led the rest of his fleet into Cadiz on 21 August 1805, and the "Sirius" was sent to form part of the British fleet blockading them there. With Nelson's arrival to take command of the fleet, the main body was moved out to sea, with a chain of four frigates and four ships of the line established to observe the fleet in Cadiz and transmit signals about their movements to the British fleet. "Sirius" was the closest to the port and at first light on 19 October it was observed that the enemy were preparing to put to sea. "Sirius" immediately signalled the next frigate in the line, Henry Blackwood's , 'Enemy have their topsails hoisted'. Thus Prowse began the process that would lead to the interception of the combined fleet two days later. An hour later at 7 a.m. "Sirius" ran up three flags to signal code number 370, 'Enemy ships are coming out of port or getting under sail'. The signal was repeated down the line, reaching Nelson 48 miles away aboard HMS "Victory" at 9.30 a.m.
The next morning, 20 October 1805, a strange sail was reported off the entrance to the harbour. Prowse asked for and was given permission by Blackwood to investigate, and closed on the stranger. By the time this had been achieved the 74-gun "Héros" had come within range and opened fire. "Sirius" nevertheless stopped the stranger with a shot across her bow and sent an officer over to inspect her. It was determined that the ship in question was a neutral American merchant, and she was allowed to continue on her way. Prowse recovered the boat and hauled away from the French warship. The entire combined fleet had finally put to sea by 10 a.m., whereupon a burst of rainy squalls caused the frigates to lose sight of it until midday.
Prowse and the other frigates continued to shadow the fleet until 7.30 a.m. on 21 October, when Nelson signalled the four frigate captains; Prowse of the "Sirius", Blackwood of the "Euryalus", Capel of the , and Dundas of the , to come aboard the "Victory". There they received their orders for the battle, which were to take station windward of the "Victory" and so repeat his signals to the rest of the fleet. They were also to observe the progress of the battle, report on escaping ships, take over surrendered enemy ships that had not been taken and take in tow dismasted British ships or their prizes. They then all went below and witnessed Nelson's will. Departing "Victory" to return to "Sirius" as the former closed on the enemy line, Prowse said goodbye to his nephew, Captain Charles Adair, who was commander of the marines on "Victory".
During the battle "Sirius" maintained her station out of the immediate battle, and suffered no casualties. After its end, she moved in and took the "Victory" under tow, but as the weather worsened she handed over to the larger 64-gun . The week after the battle Prowse was sent into Cadiz with a note from Collingwood to the Marquis de Solana, requesting the use of the town's facilities for the Spanish prisoners.
Continued service and later years.
Prowse remained aboard the "Sirius" in the Mediterranean serving under Vice-Admiral Collingwood. On 17 April 1806 he engaged an enemy flotilla off Civitavecchia. The flotilla consisted of the 18-gun corvette "Bergère", three armed brigs, a bomb vessel, a cutter and three gunboats. The "Bergère" held off the "Sirius" until Prowse forced her surrender. For this action Prowse was mentioned in despatches and awarded a sword from the Lloyd's Patriotic Fund. The "Sirius" was paid off in May 1808 and in March 1810 Prowse took command of the 74-gun HMS "Theseus". He was nominated a Companion of the Bath on 4 June 1815, and a Colonel of the Royal Marines on 12 August 1819. He commanded her in the North Sea until 23 December 1813, after which he went onshore and saw no further active service. He was promoted to rear-admiral on 19 July 1821 and died on 23 March 1826 in St Pancras, London at the age of 72.

Robert Young Pickering

Robert Young Pickering (1849 – 1931) was a British industrialist.
Early life.
Pickering was born at Railway Cottage, Shildon, County Durham, England in 1849, the eldest son of John Pickering 1823 - 1900 and Elizabeth Young 1828 - 1890. Robert’s father at the time of his birth was classified as a “British Teacher”. Robert’s only sibling Jonathan was born in 1855. By 1861 the family had moved from Railway Cottage to Main Street, Shildon. John Pickering had over the past ten years changed his profession from teacher to proprietor and head of an iron foundry employing 52 men and four boys.
Family move to Scotland.
In 1864 John Pickering moved his family to Scotland and set about constructing his new works in Netherton Wishaw Lanarkshire, which came on stream in 1865. Robert, aged 16, joined his father in the new operation in Wishaw, building railway carriages, wagons and carrying out repairs on rolling stock. In December 1868 at 3 Park Gardens, Glasgow, the home of his in-laws, Robert Young Pickering married Ellen Caldwell Anderson, the daughter of John Anderson, a wealthy Glasgow merchant. Robert and his wife remained at 3 Park Gardens living with her family into the 1880s, this was where his only child was born Robina Ellinor Graham (1873–1916). He lived with his family until 1896 at 19 Montgomerie Quadrant Kelvinside. He was involved with St Brides church adjacent to this building.
Company history.
Pickering’s of Wishaw expanded and by 1870 they were employing around 150 men and 50 boys. Over the next few years the tide changed and in 1878 the business was on the verge of collapse with a workforce reduced to 14 men, one foreman and a dog.
Robert took control of the business from his father and over the next decade built the business into a thriving railway carriage and wagon fabricators. The expansion included the opening of a second depot at Rawyards, in nearby Airdrie with now a workforce of around 500.
To compete as an international player Robert required to raise capital and in 1888 floated the business as a private limited company as R Y Pickering & Co Ltd, with himself as managing director. On the formation of the new company Robert was paid £4,000 in cash and £4,000 in ordinary shares. By 1906 his shares were worth £70,000 however he was no longer the majority shareholder this he had lost back in 1901 to John Wilson a Lanarkshire coal magnate.
At the end of the 19th century Robert Young Pickering purchased the Dumfriesshire estate of Conheath and through the Edwardian years carried out major improvements.
In the 1901 census we find his nephew John Johnston King Pickering 1880–1914 son of his brother Jonathan, living with Robert and Ellen at the mansion house of Conheath. John was employed by R Y Pickering & Co Ltd as Roberts assistant.
In 1903 Roberts daughter Robina was married in Dumfries to her cousin John J K Pickering. In earlier writings on R Y Pickering, John was referred to as his son, rather than nephew/son-in-law. With the marriage came additional rewards with John being appointed company secretary in 1904. Also in this year John and Robina provided Robert with his only grandchild Christopher Robert Pickering.
R Y Pickering & Co Ltd found the first decade of the 20th century challenging times with dwindling profits and the loss of home market share. Expansion of the repair sector helped to offset some of this with new depots in Fife and Sheffield.
The company looked at oversees orders in particular India and South Africa.
Life must have become very tough for Robert Pickering in 1909, with mounting personal debts, the death of his wife Ellen and company losses of £5,628.
By the following year the company loss reached almost £14,000. During 1911 he was removed from the position of managing director the post he held from the formation in 1888 in the company, which held his name. He had no further involvement in the company and retired to the life of a country gentleman at Conheath.
Retirement.
A year after the death of his wife, Robert re-married in the spring of 1910 to Isabelle Edith Jardine the daughter of Sir Alexander Jardine of Applegirth Baronet. Her family resided at Jardine Hall, near Lockerbie part of the founding family of Hong Kong and Jardine and Matheson. Her mother was Henrietta Younger of the Scottish brewing family.
His life in retirement enabled Robert to indulge in his passion for books, and to house them he extended Conheath in 1919 with a new library and billiard room, using the Ayr architect James Morris. This was not the first time he had employed Morris, in 1909 he was engaged to design a new family chapel in the Baroque style. Much of the Morris designs were never built probably due to financial restraints and a more modest Arts and Crafts design were produced by Sir Robert Lorimer. The chapel was not completed until the late 1920s. Lorimer also designed Conheath Farmhouse in 1916 in the arts and crafts style.
Robert’s daughter Robina died in an Edinburgh nursing home in 1916 leaving his grandson Christopher an orphan, his father John J K Pickering having died two years earlier at the age of 34 in Natal, South Africa.
Robert Young Pickering died at Conheath at the age of 82 and his second wife Isabel Edith (Jardine) died the following year. Both were interred at Conheath Chapel, with his first wife and daughter in the family crypt. The Chapel with surrounding policies is the only part of Conheath estate to remain in the ownership of the Pickering family (Ralph Pickering of Kintradwell) to this day.
At his death Robert left an estate of £11,126, beside a number of small legacies, his grandson Christopher inherited everything including Conheath Estate. In 1933 the tenanted farm was sold for £6,500 and the mansion house and grounds a few years later.
Christopher left Britain and settled in Cape Town where he was a government official, he married first Georgina Martin Gilmour, at Cathcart Glasgow in 1932 and divorced 1935, he later married c. 1950 Mignonne Jean 16 years his junior (died 2008 Cape Town). On the 29th May 1951 Christopher’s daughter Robin Anne was born to continue the Pickering dynasty.

Millard-Souther-Green House

The Millard-Souther-Green House is a historic house at 218 Green Street in Stoneham, Massachusetts. Built c. 1700, it is one of the oldest buildings in Stoneham. It is a two story timber frame structure with an asymmetrical four bay facade. The entry is in the second bay from the left, with the slightly off-center chimney behind. The house was likely built by Thomas Millard, who sold it to the Souther family in 1725.
The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle

The Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle is also referred to as MC-19 (Mars Chart-19).
The Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle covers the area from 0° to 45° west longitude and 0° to 30° south latitude on Mars. This quadrangle shows many signs of past water with evidence of lakes, deltas, ancient rivers, inverted channels, and chaos regions that released water. Margaritifer Sinus contains some of the longest lake-chain systems on Mars, perhaps because of a wetter climate, more groundwater, or some of each factor. The Samara/Himera lake-chain system is about 1800 km long; the Parara/Loire valley network and lake-chain system is about 1100 km long. A low area between Parana Valles and Loire Vallis is believed to have once held a lake. The 154 km diameter Holden Crater also once held a lake. Near Holden Crater is a graben, called Erythraea Fossa, that once held a chain of three lakes.
This region of Mars is famous because the Opportunity Rover landed there on January 25, 2004 at 1.94°S and 354.47°E (5.53° W).
What Opportunity Rover Discovered about Rocks and Minerals at Meridiani Planum.
Opportunity Rover found that the soil at Meridiani Planum was very similar to the soil at Gusev crater and Ares Vallis; however in many places at Meridiani the soil was covered with round, hard, gray spherules that were named "blueberries." These blueberries were found to be composed almost entirely of the mineral hematite. It was decided that the spectra signal spotted from orbit by Mars Odyssey was produced by these spherules. After further study it was decided that the blueberries were concretions formed in the ground by water. Over time, these concretions weathered from what was overlying rock, and then became concentrated on the surface as a lag deposit. The concentration of spherules in bedrock could have produced the observed blueberry covering from the weathering of as little as one meter of rock. Most of the soil consisted of olivine basalt sands that did not come from the local rocks. The sand may have been transported from somewhere else.
Minerals in Dust.
A Mössbauer spectrum was made of the dust that gathered on Opportunity’s capture magnet. The results suggested that the magnetic component of the dust was titanomagnetite, rather than just plain magnetite, as was once thought. A small amount of olivine was also detected which was interpreted as indicating a long arid period on the planet. On the other hand, a small amount of hematite that was present meant that there may have been liquid water for a short time in the early history of the planet.
Because the Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT) found it easy to grind into the bedrocks, it is thought that the rocks are much softer than the rocks at Gusev crater.
Bedrock Minerals.
Few rocks were visible on the surface where Opportunity landed, but bedrock that was exposed in craters was examined by the suit of instruments on the Rover. Bedrock rocks were found to be sedimentary rocks with a high concentration of sulfur in the form of calcium and magnesium sulfates. Some of the sulfates that may be present in bedrocks are kieserite, sulfate anhydrate, bassanite, hexahydrite, epsomite, and gypsum. Salts, such as halite, bischofite, antarcticite, bloedite, vanthoffite, or gluberite may also be present.
The rocks contained the sulfates had a light tone compared to isolated rocks and rocks examined by landers/rovers at other locations on Mars. The spectra of these light toned rocks, containing hydrated sulfates, were similar to spectra taken by the Thermal Emission Spectrometer on board the Mars Global Surveyor. The same spectrum is found over a large area, so it is believed that water once appeared over a wide region, not just in the area explored by Opportunity Rover.
The Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) found rather high levels of phosphorus in the rocks. Similar high levels were found by other rovers at Ares Vallis and Gusev Crater, so it has been hypothesized that the mantle of Mars may be phosphorus-rich. The minerals in the rocks could have originated by acid weathering of basalt. Because the solubility of phosphorus is related to the solubility of uranium, thorium, and rare earth elements, they are all also expected to be enriched in rocks.
When Opportunity Rover traveled to the rim of Endeavour crater, it soon found a white vein that was later identified as being pure gypsum. It was formed when water carrying gypsum in solution deposited the mineral in a crack in the rock. A picture of this vein, called "Homestake" formation, is shown below.
Evidence for Water.
Examination of Meridiani rocks found strong evidence for past water. The mineral called jarosite which only forms in water was found in all bedrocks. This discovery proved that water once existed in Meridiani Planum In addition, some rocks showed small laminations (layers) with shapes that are only made by gently flowing water. The first such laminations were found in a rock called "The Dells." Geologists would say that the cross-stratification showed festoon geometry from transport in subaqueous ripples. A picture of cross-stratification, also called cross-bedding, is shown on the left.
Box-shaped holes in some rocks were caused by sulfates forming large crystals, and then when the crystals later dissolved, holes, called vugs, were left behind. The concentration of the element bromine in rocks was highly variable probably because it is very soluble. Water may have concentrated it in places before it evaporated. Another mechanism for concentrating highly-soluble bromine compounds is frost deposition at night that would form very thin films of water that would concentrate bromine in certain spots.
Rock from Impact.
One rock, "Bounce Rock," found sitting on the sandy plains was found to be ejecta from an impact crater. Its chemistry was different than the bedrocks. Containing mostly pyroxene and plagioclase and no olivine, it closely resembled a part, Lithology B, of the shergottite meteorite EETA 79001, a meteorite known to have come from Mars. Bounce rock received its name by being near an airbag bounce mark.
Meteorites.
Opportunity Rover found meteorites just sitting on the plains. The first one analyzed with Opportunity’s instruments was called "Heatshield Rock," as it was found near where Opportunity’s headshield landed. Examination with the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES), Mossbauer spectrometer, and APXS lead researchers to, classify it as an IAB meteorite. The APXS determined it was composed of 93% iron and 7% nickel. The cobble named "Fig Tree Barberton" is thought to be a stony or stony-iron meteorite (mesosiderite silicate), while "Allan Hills," and "Zhong Shan" may be iron meteorites.
Geological History.
Observations at the site have led scientists to believe that the area was flooded with water a number of times and was subjected to evaporation and desiccation. In the process sulfates were deposited. After sulfates cemented the sediments, hematite concretions grew by precipitation from groundwater. Some sulfates formed into large crystals which later dissolved to leave vugs. Several lines of evidence point toward an arid climate in the past billion years or so, but a climate supporting water, at least for a time, in the distant past.
Vallis.
Vallis (plural "valles") is the Latin word for "valley". It is used in planetary geology for the naming of valley landform features on other planets.
Vallis was used for old river valleys that were discovered on Mars, when probes were first sent to Mars. The Viking Orbiters caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars; huge river valleys were found in many areas. Space craft cameras showed that floods of water broke through dams, carved deep valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and traveled thousands of kilometers.
Branched streams seen by Viking.
The Viking Orbiters discovered much about water on Mars. Branched streams, studied by the Orbiters in the southern hemisphere, suggested that rain once fell.
Aureum Chaos.
Aureum Chaos is a major canyon system and collapsed area. It is probably a major source of water for large outflow channels.
Large outflow channels on Mars are believed to be caused by catastrophic discharges of ground water. Many of the channels begin in chaotic terrain, where the ground has apparently collapsed. In the collapsed section, blocks of undisturbed material be seen. The OMEGA experiment on Mars Express discovered clay minerals (phyllosilicates) in a variety of places in Aureum Chaos. Clay minerals need water to form, so the area may once have contained large amounts of water. Scientists are interested in determining what parts of Mars contained water because evidence of past or present life may be found there.
On April 1, 2010, NASA released the first images under the HiWish program, with the public suggesting places for HiRISE to photograph. One of the eight locations was Aureum Chaos. The first image below gives a wide view of the area. The next two images are from the HiRISE image.
Mars Science Laboratory.
Several sites in the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle have been proposed as areas to send NASA's next major Mars rover, the Mars Science Laboratory. Both Holden Crater and Eberswalde Crater made the cut to be among the top four. Miyamoto Crater was in the top 7 sites chosen. Holden Crater is believed to have once been a lake. Actually, it is now believed that it held two lakes. The first was longer lived and was formed from drainage within the crater and precipitation. The last lake began when water damed up in Uzboi Vallis broke through a divide, then rapidly drained into Holden Crater. Because there are rocks meters in diameter on the crater floor, it is thought it was a powerful flood when water flowed into the crater.
Eberswalde Crater contains a delta. There is a great deal of evidence that Miyamoto Crater once contained rivers and lakes. Many minerals, such as clays, chlorides, sulfates, and iron oxides, have been discovered there.
These minerals are often formed in water. A picture below shows an inverted channel in Miyamoto Crater. Inverted channels formed from accumulated sediments that were cemented by minerals. These channels eroded into the surface, then the whole area was covered over with sediments. When the sediments were later eroded away, the place where the river channel existed remained because the hardened material that was deposited in the channel was resistant to erosion. Iani Chaos, pictured below, was among the top 33 landing sites. Deposits of hematite and gypsum have been found there. Those minerals are usually formed in connection with water.
The aim of the Mars Science Laboratory is to search for signs of ancient life. It is hoped that a later mission could then return samples from sites that the Mars Science Laboratory identified as probably containing remains of life. To safely bring the craft down, a 12 mile wide, smooth, flat circle is needed. Geologists hope to examine places where water once ponded. They would like to examine sediment layers.
Inverted relief.
Some places on Mars show inverted relief. In these locations, a stream bed may be a raised feature, instead of a valley. The inverted former stream channels may be caused by the deposition of large rocks or due to cementation. In either case erosion would erode the surrounding land and leave the old channel as a raised ridge because the ridege will be more resistant to erosion. An image below, taken with HiRISE of Miyamoto Crater shows a ridge that is an old channel that has become inverted.
Deltas.
Researchers have found a number of examples of deltas that formed in Martian lakes. Finding deltas is a major sign that Mars once had a lot of water. Deltas often require deep water over a long period of time to form. Also, the water level needs to be stable to keep sediment from washing away. Deltas have been found over a wide geographical range. Below, are pictures of a few.
Craters.
Impact craters generally have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits. As craters get larger (greater than 10 km in diameter) they usually have a central peak. The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact. Sometimes craters will display layers. Craters can show us what lies deep under the surface.
In December 2011, Opportunity Rover discovered a vein of gypsum sticking out of the soil along the rim of Endeavour crater.. Tests confirmed that it contained calcium, sulfur, and water. The mineral gypsum is the best match for the data. It likely formed from mineral rich water moving through a crack in the rock. The vein, called "Homestake," is in Mars' Meridiani plain. It could have been produced in conditions more neutral than the harshly acidic conditions indicated by the other sulfate deposits; hence this environment may have been more hospitable for a large variety of living organisms. Homestake is in a zone where the sulfate-rich sedimentary bedrock of the plains meets older, volcanic bedrock exposed at the rim of Endeavour crater.

Han Han

Han Han (born September 23, 1982) is a Chinese professional rally driver, best-selling author, singer, creator of "Party", One (App magazine) and China's most popular blogger He has published five novels to date, and is represented by the Hong Kong based Peony Literary Agency. He is also involved in music production. In May 2010, Han Han was named one of the most influential people in the world by Time magazine. In September 2010, British magazine New Statesman listed Han Han at 48th place in the list of "The World's 50 Most Influential Figures 2010". In June 2010, Han Han was interviewed by CNN as China's rebel writer who has become the unofficial voice for his generation.
Early life and increasing prominence.
Han's first essay, "Unhappy Days" (不快乐地混日子), was published when he was attending junior middle school. He was admitted to Shanghai's Song Jiang No. 2 High School (上海市松江二中) based on his sporting achievements. During his first year of high school (1999), Han won first prize in China's New Concept Writing Competition with his essay, "Seeing Ourselves in a Cup" (杯中窥人), on the Chinese national character. Failing seven subjects at the year-end examination, Han was retained for a year in school. This incident was reported in the media and ignited a heated debate on China's "quality education" (素质教育) policy, whether holistic or specialised learning should be implemented in schools, and other educational issues. Following another seven subject failure in the senior middle school second year examinations, Han quit school.
After dropping out of school, Han worked on a series of essays – "One Degree Below Freezing" (零下一度), "Press Release 2003" (通稿 2003), "And I Drift" (就这么飘来飘去), and "Miscellaneous Essays" (杂的文). His essays were accepted into various publications. Han's first novel, "Triple Door" (三重门), on life as a third-year junior school student in Shanghai, raised his prominence in China outside Shanghai. With over twenty million copies printed, this novel is China's bestselling literary work in the last 20 years. Other novels – "Like a Speeding Youth" (像少年啦飞驰), "Riot in Chang'an City" (长安乱), "A Fortress" (一座城池), "Glory Days" (光荣日), "His Kingdom" (他的国) were also published during this time.
Fueled by his love of racing, Han became a professional rally driver and wrote less frequently. However, he continued to blog on current affairs, with some articles attracting a large number of readers and sparking intense debates. Han's blog has registered well over 300 million hits, the largest online following of a personal blog in China.
In February 2005, a Hollywood movie was planned with the script to be based on Chinese writer Xie Hang's novel, "Dysmenorrhoea" (痛经), and filming to take place in a northern Chinese city. As Han's image suited him to play the male lead role, the Chinese partner company recommended him for the role to the American producers. When media outlets asked Han for his views on this matter, he replied, "I have yet to receive this invitation, but basically I would reject it." He explained, "It doesn't matter that this is a Hollywood movie, as my decision would depend on who's playing the female lead." On hearing that the script was about the forbidden love between a boy and his female teacher, Han laughed and rejected the role, saying, "This makes it even more difficult for me, I will not play such a role."
Han is also involved in music production. His debut album, "R-18" (十八禁, restricted to 18 and above), was released in September 2006, with all lyrics self-composed.
Controversies.
The Han-Bai controversy.
On 2 March 2006, Chinese literary critic and bookseller Bai Ye (白烨) published a blog post entitled, "Status and Future of the Post-80 Generation" (”80后“现状与未来), a harsh criticism of the works of writers born in the 1980–1989 period. Han responded critically with his online article "The "Literary Circle" Is Bullshit, Don't Act Pretentious" (文坛是个屁 谁都别装逼). This exchange escalated into the "Han-Bai controversy", with both sides arguing on issues such as the post-80 classification, whether the works of post-80s qualified as literature and whether post-80 writers should be considered real writers.
On 4 March 2006, Bai published an online article entitled "My Declaration – a Reply to Han Han" (我的声明 – 回应韩寒), stating that Han's articles in this exchange had crossed the boundaries of literary debate into the realm of humiliation and personal attack. Subsequently, writer Lu Tianming (陆天明), his director son Lu Chuan (陆川), and musician Gao Xiaosong (高晓松), entered the debate, which became the focus of the online community for a time. Han debated with the above personalities on his blog. The debate finally concluded with Bai, Lu Tianming, Lu Chuan, and Gao shutting down their personal blogs.
Han against Modern Poetry.
Questioning the value of modern Chinese free verse, Han posted a blog article on 26 September 2006 entitled "Why do modern Chinese poetry and poets still exist?" (现代诗和诗人为什么还存在). In this and other related articles, he parodied modern Chinese poets including the late Xu Zhimo (徐志摩) and the late Hai Zi (海子), igniting a controversy involving poets such as the Lower Body Poet Shen Haobo, Yang Li (杨黎), Yi Sha (伊沙), and Dong Li (东篱).
Han-Zheng controversy.
On 10 April 2007, Han criticised rock singer Zheng Jun's (郑钧) capriciousness in a blog post entitled "Some Recent Arrangements" (最近的一些安排), igniting a debate between the two. In 2006, Zheng condemned the Super Girl singing competition (超级女声) as being "unbearably disgusting", but participated in the judging for a similar competition Super Boy (快乐男声) in 2007.
Ghostwriting allegation.
On 15 January 2012, the blogger, technology entrepreneur, and former Baidu employee Mai Tian alleged in a blog post that the majority of Han's work was produced by a team of ghostwriters. Mai Tian claimed that Han Han's early work, including "Triple Door", was in fact produced by Han's father, Han Renjun, a literature aficionado who was forced to leave university due to his condition of Hepatitis B. In addition, Mai Tian accused Han's publisher Lu Jinbo of leading a ghostwriting team that produced and published most of Han's work; Mai also questioned how Han was able to become a nationally acclaimed writer while maintaining fitness to participate in many high-level rally races. Han categorically denied the claims in a blog post dated 16 January 2012, and Mai Tian had since removed the post from his blog and formally apologized to Han on 18 January 2012.
On 16 January 2012, the Chinese scientific author and anti-fraud crusader Fang Zhouzi published a blog post, in which Fang concurred with Mai Tian and further raised questions on the plausibility of Han's works. Despite Mai Tian's retraction of his statements against Han, Fang continued to assert that Han's work was produced by ghostwriters. Han again denied Fang's claims and sued Fang for defamation on 29 January 2012. Besides Fang, Han also sued a man named Liu Mingze, who is said to have forwarded an article claiming that Han's work was produced by a team of ghostwriters. However, Han withdrew his prosecution a few days after the prosecution was accepted by the Putuo courthouse of Shanghai. Later, in an interview with a reporter, Han admitted that the person named Liu Mingze was actually a friend of his. Han sued this person so that the prosecution can be accepted by the Putuo courthouse since Liu Mingze was living in the zone of Putuo.
Later Mai Tian came back to support Fang's statements against Han.
Setup of online bookstore and magazine.
On 19 April 2009, Han launched his online bookstore, "Han Han's Bookstore", on the Taobao online shopping marketplace (淘宝网). The bookstore site stated that it would sell only Han's original autographed books. As the number of sales transactions on Han Han's Bookstore was unusually large, the online system erroneously classified these as false transactions and attempts at credit fraud, leading Taobao to investigate the issue.
On 1 May 2009, Han posted an article on his blog entitled "Request for articles, recruitment, article fees and article submission email address for a new magazine". The post mentioned that Han would be setting up a magazine, informing the email addresses for article submission, response to recruitment ads, and advertising offers, but without revealing the magazine's title to prevent illegal copying. The blog post also mentioned that the writer of the selected cover story, if the story had not been previously published, would get up to RMB 2,000 per 1,000 characters in article fees. This would be 10 to 40 times of the standard rate in China's publishing industry, and 2 to 4 times higher than what China's top magazine would pay China's top writer for an article. Writers of previously unpublished non-cover story articles in the magazine would be paid RMB 1,000 per 1,000 characters, 10 to 20 times higher than standard rates in the publishing industry. As for previously-published articles or selected extracts from articles, the rate would be RMB 500 per 1,000 characters, which would be about 15 times the standard rates. Contributors of photographs would be paid up to RMB 5,000 per photograph.
Han also invited article submissions for a "braindead" (脑残) column, deliberately publishing articles that the magazine disagreed with or were not up to standards. The rate for such articles would be RMB 250 per 1,000 characters. 250 () is a Chinese slang with the same meaning of "You idiot". Han gave the rationale for including this column:
Within five days of putting up the blog post, Han received over 10,000 article submissions from across China, and also a few thousand résumés. Interestingly, there were several articles of the types which Han had expressly forbidden from submission, such as cut and paste jobs, pornographic literature and dissertations. Han expressed his exasperation with these and declared that such articles would not be published.
Han's setup of his magazine received widespread attention, with editors proclaiming that the higher fees enabled the writing profession to regain a measure of financial independence and dignity One journalist even commented that Han had completed his transformation from a rebellious youth into a full-fledged intellectual.
Due to certain publishing and circulation restrictions in China, Han's magazine, which was originally planned for publication in August 2009, remained unpublished for some time.
One of the delays was reportedly because of an article that detailed the blacklisting of actors.
On July 6, 2010, his magazine "Party" (独唱团) was finally published.
According to the publisher, the magazine became the most popular book on Amazon.cn less than 10 hours after pre-selling.
However, it only lasted one issue. In December, 2010, Global Times, a state-linked newspaper, reported "Han Han's magazine dies". The paper reported: "Han went through more than 10 publishers to try and save that content and may have planned to include in the second issue." 
On June 11, 2012, Han Han published his own digital magazine "One（一个）" with his old editororial board of the “Party（独唱团）“ magazine. He first published ios app, and then was able to launch the Android version "One" app on November 28, 2012. As stated in his foreword of the "One" magazine, he wishes his readers to take off a few minutes everyday to read and think. The basic frame of this magazine is to offer one picutre, one article, and one Q&A column everyday.
Faced with critics saying he was not directly talking about democracy and the government this time, he said he felt "tired" of the repetitive political discussion on the web, so he decided to focus on editing a good magazine this time.
Rally racing career.
After Han turned professional as a rally driver, there were rumours that he had encountered financial difficulties. Han himself admitted that writers and race car drivers in China earned less compared to those in other professions. Furthermore, his only income source was from book royalties as he was not involved in other revenue generating activities. However, he continued to race as it gave him a sense of achievement. Winning prizes also enabled him to prove to himself that he was a well-rounded learner. As Han stated in a media interview in 2007:
The following highlights some of Han's achievements in his racing career:
After his experiences at the WRC Rally Australia in 2009, he wrote a blog post entitled "Report on supervision and guidance work in preparation for the WRC in Australia" (赴澳大利亚监督指导世界拉力锦标赛的工作报告), using irony to express dissatisfaction with China's standards of race management, economic conditions, political consciousness of the population, etc. in comparison with Australia.
Music.
R-18 is Han Han's first album. It was released on September 26, 2006 by ShangHai ToWing Culture Development Co., Ltd.

Micah Williams House

The Micah Williams House is a historic house at 342 William Street in Stoneham, Massachusetts. The 1.5 story Greek Revival cottage was built c. 1830 by Micah Williams. Unlike many Greek Revival buildings, which have the gable end facing the street, this one has the front on the roof side, a more traditional colonial orientation. The house was built by Williams for his daughter.
The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

Williams-Linscott House

The Williams-Linscott House was a historic First Period house at 357 William Street in Stoneham, Massachusetts. The oldest part of the house was said to date to c. 1712, but it is unclear to which part of the house this referred, on account of major alterations the house in the 18th and 19th centuries. It is believed to have begun as a four-room two-story structure built around a central chimney. This underwent significant alteration during the Federal period, including replacing the center chimney with smaller side chimneys, and the construction of four more rooms in front of the original four. Sometime around 1850 Micah Williams, a prosperous farmer, again refashioned the house in the then-popular Italianate style.
The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It was demolished in 2004, although architectural elements of the house were salvaged and reused elsewhere.

Surflon S-111

Surflon S-111 (CAS 72968-3-88) is a commercial product consisting of perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) in ammonium salt form. It is commonly used as a polymerization aid in the production of fluoropolymers. 
The dominant chemical compound is perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) at 74% by weight, followed by the 11 carbon perfluoroundecanoic acid (20%), and the 13 carbon perfluorotridecanoic acid (5%).
Surflon S-111 is synthesized in Japan by oxidizing a mixture of fluorotelomer olefins. Fluorotelomer olefins are synthesized using a telomerization of tetrafluoroethylene taxogens (monomers), followed by an ethylene insertion. The olefin is oxidized, removing one carbon to yield products with an odd number of carbons with even-lengthed fluorocarbon chains plus a carboxylic acid group. As the fluorotelomer olefins are dominated by F(CF2)8CH=CH2, PFNA is the major PFCA product.
Surflon S-111 "is described as Fatty acids, C7-C13, perfluoro, ammonium salts".

Matteo Babini

Matteo Antonio Babini ( – ), also known by the family name of Babbini, was a leading Italian tenor of the late 18th-century, and a teacher of singing and stage art.
Life and career.
Matteo Babini was born in Bologna on .
After studying in his town with Arcangelo Cortoni, he made his début at Modena probably in 1770 or 1771, at the age of 16 or 17, as a second tenor. It is likely he sang in a revival of Paisiello’s "Demetrio".
After performing in several Italian theatres, most notably Venice’s San Benedetto, Babini was engaged, between 1777 and 1781, to appear at Berlin’s Court and, later, to perform works by Paisiello in Saint Petersburg. While there he was popular performing in the Apulia composer’s operas, even some in the comic genre with which he was not associated while in Italy.
Babini went on to perform all around Europe, including Lisbon, Madrid, Vienna, and London. In 1786, in London, he took part in the premiere of Cherubini’s "Giulio Sabino".
His career in Italy continued successfully through the nineties, with highlights including his part in the premiere of Cimarosa’s "Gli Orazi e i Curiazi", where he played the part of the villainous hero "Marcus Horatius".
Babini retired from the stage in 1803, though he was still in demand for premiere performances by such composers as Zingarelli and Bertoni.
Having settled again in his native town, after an Italian career based almost wholly around Venice, he then proceeded to teach. In addition to singing, he also taught the "stage art" by which he had so much distinguished himself. One of his pupils was a teenaged Gioachino Rossini, who would recount, to Ferdinand Hiller in his old age, the story of his juvenile fancies to become a singer and of his meeting the great tenor.
Babini died in Bologna on .
Artistic contributions.
Matteo Babini played a key part in the recovery, towards the end of the 18th century, of the expressive character of operatic singing which, had been losing favour to the vocal acrobatics of the castrati and the higher notes of the sopranos. Being a baritonal tenor with a very narrow range, and not being particularly versed in coloratura, Babini felt at ease in only one octave (although, eventually, Orazi’s only virtuoso aria was assigned to him).
Babini's main contributions to the renaissance of operatic art were through his role of actor-singer, and he became known for the exuberant style of his recitals, the realism of his acting, and his imposing stage presence - he was said to be tall, blond, and slender, and with a very fine countenance.
According to Giovanni Morelli, Babini's repertoire developed following his stays in Paris during the crucial moments of the French Revolution, in the years 1787-9, and in 1792, and shifted towards the new-fashioned historical drama and the Rousseau monodrama cantata, especially "Pimmalione", which he performed around the major Italian theatres with a huge success.
In his interpretations, Babbini endeavoured to portray ""peoples' customs and heroes' vicissitudes"", and in the Venetian premiere of Cimarosa’s "Oriazi" he went on the stage wearing historical costume, ""which the audience remained so much satisfied with, that thenceforth theatres turned it into an invariable standard"".
Babini partnered, amongst others, Crescentini, Grassini, Banti, Pacchiarotti, and also the tenor Giacomo David, with whom he often alternated the same parts.

Art Bragg

Arthur "Art" George Bragg (born December 3, 1930) is an American sprinter who competed in the 1952 Summer Olympics.
Career.
He was born in Baltimore and attended Baltimore's Morgan State College., 
In 1952 he was eliminated in the semi-finals of the Olympic 100 metres event. Running with a pulled muscle, he finished 'a miserable last' in his race. Bragg was considered the favourite for the title having won the USA Olympic Trials 100m in the absence, through injury, of the man judged to be the best American sprinter, Jim Golliday. Bragg also tried to qualify for the 200 m event but was only fourth in his semi-final at the Olympic Trials.
At the 1951 Pan American Games he was a member of the American relay team which won the gold medal in the 4×100 metres competition. In the 100 metres contest as well as in the 200 metres event he won the silver medal. In both races he lost narrowly to Cuba's Rafael Fortun.
Always a keen college runner, in 1953, Bragg helped, as anchor leg, Morgan State College to victories in the quarter- and half-mile relays at the Penn Relays. Bragg also completed a triple of individual wins.
Bragg continued running after leaving college. In 1954 he won the 100 and 220 yards titles at the AAU Championships. In both he established new AAU meet records of 9.4 and 21.1 s respectively.
Bragg was famed at the time he was racing for his often slow start to his races with a subsequent fast finish and the disappointments he suffered in his career at the major championships.
In 1954, Bragg was one of the candidates for the prestigious James E. Sullivan Award that is presented annually by the AAU to the outstanding American athlete. If he had won he would have been the first African-American recipient of the award. In the end, the award went to Mal Whitfield.
Bragg has admitted his Olympic disappointment lives with him - when watching the 100 m "I cried," Bragg said. "I had successes; that was the major disappointment. Every Olympics, when I watch the 100 on TV, I break down and cry." He has described his 1952 injury as a total fluke - whilst on the warmup strip "Someone opened one of the doors and I made a quick motion to my left to avoid hitting it . . . oops, the hamstring went.". 
In later years, Bragg is reported as living in Los Angeles and working for Los Angeles County Probation Department as a Deputy Probation Officer. He is married with one child, a boy. He left for California in 1956 and never returned to Maryland. His son studied at Howard University.
Rankings.
Bragg was ranked among the best in the USA and the world in both the 100 m/100 y and 200 m/220 y sprint events from 1950 to 1954, according to the votes of the experts of "Track and Field News".
USA Championships.
Bragg was always a formidable performer at the AAU championships, the USA national championships.

Richard de Hoton

Richard de Hoton (died 9 January 1308) was prior of Durham after his election to that role on 24 March 1290. He is notable for his professional tensions with his bishop Antony Bek.
Life.
Having previously served as Prior of Lytham, he denied his bishop Antony Bek the right of episcopal visitation, launching appeals to York, Canterbury and Rome. Bek excommunicated Hoton for contumacy on 20 May 1300 and deprived him of his office the following day for disobedience, perjury and violation of monastic rule. King Edward I of England agreed a temporary reconciliation between Hoton and Bek on 20 June, though this was not to last and on 10 August Bek appointed the Prior of Lindisfarne, Henry of Lusby or Luceby, to replace Hoton. Ten days later Lusby forced his way into the monastery, forcibly removed Hoton from his stall and had him imprisoned. Lusby was formally installed on 24 August, but Hoton escaped from the prison on 16 December 1300.
On 1 March 1301 king Edward gave Hoton permission to spend two years at the papal court, and on 29 November that year Pope Boniface VIII declared that Lusby's appointment was uncanonical and that Hoton was to be reinstated. Lusby obeyed the pope, leaving Durham on 14 April 1302, with Hoton's proctor being put in possession of the monastery a week later. Hoton then arrived back in Durham on 1 August 1303, only to be suspended from office by the pope on 5 March 1306 and replaced as the monastery's administrator by Bek. Bek appointed Lusby to administer it as his proctor on 10 March, but the latter was expelled by the monks and Edward issued letters patent in April and June 1306 banning the pope's ejection of Hoton from taking place. Lusby died later in 1306 and Edward granted Hoton another year at the papal court (under royal protection) on 7 August that year. The pope then lifted Hoton's suspension and he was finally restored to his office on 1 December 1307, only to die at the papal court in 1308.

James Maury (consul)

James Maury (3 Feb 1746 – 23 Feb 1840) was one of the first United States diplomats and one of the first American consuls appointed overseas. In 1790 he was appointed to the Consulate of the United States in Liverpool, one of the first overseas consulates founded by the then fledgling United States of America. Maury held the position of consul for 39 years until he was removed from office by President Andrew Jackson in 1829.
Early life.
James Maury was born on February 1746 in Albemarle County, Virginia. He was the son of The Reverend James Maury (1719–1769), an educator and Anglican cleric in the American colonies, of Huguenot ancestry. Among The Reverend Maury's notable pupils were Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, the First Bishop of Virginia. Young James attended his father's school and was part of a class of five pupils that included Jefferson. Maury frequently accompanied Jefferson to the latter's home on Saturdays when school was not in session 
Consul at Liverpool.
Secretary of State Jefferson petitioned the then United States President George Washington for an appointment for his former classmate of two years. The petition was successful, and Maury, who was already living and working as a merchant in Liverpool, was appointed consul of the United States at Liverpool in 1790. 
The Consulate of the United States in Liverpool was one of the first overseas consulates founded by the then fledgling United States. Liverpool was at the time an important centre for Transatlantic commerce and a vital trading partner for the former Thirteen Colonies.
In 1801 Maury chaired the inaugural meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Liverpool, representing Liverpool merchants trading with the United States. Maury was the first signatory to the society's rules and was its first President.
Maury held the position of consul for 39 years under six U.S. presidents, until 1829, when he was removed from office by President Andrew Jackson. A Silver platter was presented to him by the merchants of Liverpool after his forty years of service. The inscription reads: "Presented by the merchants and other inhabitants of Liverpool to James Maury, Esq., Late Consul of the United States of America in that Town as a mark of general respect on his removal from an Office which he had honourably held for forty years, 1829."
Maury's Liverpool residence was at number 4 Rodney St. His portrait, painted by Gilbert Stuart Newton, still hangs today in the West Reception Room in Liverpool Town Hall.
Personal life.
Maury was married twice, firstly to Catherine Armistead, and secondly to Margaret Rutson. He and Rutson had five children: James Sifrein Maury (1797–1864); William Maury (1799–1849); Matthew Maury (1800–1877); Ann Maury (1803–1876); Rutson Maury (1805–1882). Ann Maury conducted considerable research on her family history and published a substantial genealogical chart of the Maury family, which can be still be obtained from The Fontaine Maury Society library.
James Maury died on 23 February 1840 in New York City and is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery.
