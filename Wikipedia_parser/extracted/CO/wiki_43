RTOLAP - Real Time OLAP.
Whilst many OLAP Servers like Microsoft Analysis Services store pre-calculating consolidations and calculated elements to achieve rapid response times. A Real Time OLAP Server will calculate the values on the fly, when they are required. 
The essential characteristic of RTOLAP system is in holding all the data in RAM.
It is a protocol which analyzes fly values when required. It saves every bit of information in RAM. The calculations are executed in a “right-away” manner which reduces the setback linked with “information outburst” since it only saves information under the RAM size standard.

Surveyor General of the Northwest Territory

The Surveyor General of the Northwest Territory was a United States government official responsible for surveying land in the Northwest Territory in the United States late in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. The position was created in the Land Act of 1796 to survey lands ceded by Indians northwest of the Ohio River and above the mouth of the Kentucky River. This act, and those that followed evolved into the Public Land Survey System.
Rufus Putnam was appointed to the office in 1797, and held it until 1803. His office was in Marietta. In 1801, the position was offered to Andrew Ellicott by Thomas Jefferson, but he refused, because he was upset at slow pay for work he had done for the Federal Government. Jared Mansfield held the office from 1803 to 1813. His office was in Cincinnati. Josiah Meigs held office 1813 to 1815, and Edward Tiffin from 1815 to his death in 1829. Tiffin had his office in Chillicothe. The Surveyor General of Illinois office was created on April 29, 1816, reducing effective area to Ohio, Indiana and Michigan. William Lytle served 1829 until his death in 1831. He moved the office back to Cincinnati. Micajah T. Williams held the office 1831 to 1834, when Robert Todd Lytle took over. Ezekiel S. Haines was appointed in 1838. Judge William Johnston held the office 1841-1845 as thanks for his efforts in supporting the Whig ticket in 1840. Lucius Lyon was appointed in 1845, and moved his office to Detroit. In June, 1845, the Ohio and Indiana offices were closed, and subsequent surveys were made under the Commissioner of the General Land Office. The Surveyor General was initially paid $2000 per year, and his deputies were paid three dollars per mile surveyed. 
Putnam was occupied in 1797 with laying off the Greenville Treaty Line and surveying the United States Military District and Moravian Indian Grants, and he started the survey of Congress Lands in 1798.
Mansfield is credited with "considerable scientific ability and high standards of workmanship." He laid out astronomically the Indiana baseline and Second Principal Meridian, in spite of the difficulties. Pressures on him are illustrated in a letter Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin wrote to Mansfield: "The new act (March 13, 1805) is intended to palliate errors made in surveys north of the Ohio. At four dollars per mile, great correctness cannot be attained in that part of the country. Do your best at that price. Congress desires that corners and boundaries be definitely fixed, and the precise content of each is not equally important. A few acres more or less is not so important as it is that corners and boundaries should be known with precision to avoid litigation. It is of primary importance that the land should be surveyed and subdivided."
Tiffin established the scheme of guide meridians and standard parallels for townships distant from the principal meridians and baselines, which became a feature of the Public Land Survey System.
On March 3, 1803, a Surveyor General position was created for lands south of Tennessee, and there followed a number of similar positions over the next years. In 1822, the first surveying district was created, namely the state of Ohio, with an officer called Surveyor-General in charge.
Until the reorganization of the General Land Office in 1836, each Surveyor General acted more or less independently, setting his own standards for execution of field work.

Joel Casamayor

Joel "El Cepillo" Casamayor Johnson (born July 12, 1971 in Guantánamo, Cuba) is a Cuban boxer, who turned pro after defecting to the United States on the eve of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. The nickname "El Cepillo", literally translated to "the brush", comes from his uppercut, which rakes his opponents across the face. Also, for his ability to "brush off" punches from his opponents.
Professional career.
He won the NABF Super Featheweight title in 1999 by beating Jose Luis Noyola. Later that year, he won the WBA Super Featherweight title by stopping Jong-Kwon Baek in 5 rounds. In 2002, he lost that title in a controversial unification bout with WBO champion Acelino Freitas. At one point in the fight, Casamayor slipped and the referee ruled it a knockdown. Casamayor also had a point deducted for a late hit. Many believe Casamayor should have won the fight. In 2004, Diego Corrales, whom Casamayor stopped in 2003 for the Vacant IBA Super Featherweight Title, defeated him for the vacant WBO Super Featherweight title via a very close and controversial decision. Casamayor failed to take the WBC Lightweight title from José Luis Castillo later that year because the judges scored what seemed to be a clear win for Casamayor over Castillo. After the disputed loss to Castillo, Casamayor's career appeared to be in a downward spiral and he was set up with undefeated rising prospect Almazbek Raiymkulov in June 2005. In a close, spirited battle the bout ended in a draw, with many believing that Casamayor's best days were behind him.
After two victories against little known opposition, in October 2006, Casamayor yet again took on the popular Diego Corrales, and defeated him by split decision, winning the WBC Lightweight title and recognition as the world lightweight champion by Ring Magazine. He was stripped of the WBC title for signing to fight then WBO lightweight champion Freitas rather than defend against his mandatory challenger, WBC interim champion David Diaz. Although the fight with Freitas never took place, David Diaz was still named WBC champion and Freitas went on to fight WBA champion Juan Diaz, losing via a 9th round TKO.
After Casamayor threatened the WBC with legal action, he was named as their interim champ. He defended the interim championship as well as The Ring's title against Jose Armando Santa Cruz on November 11, 2007 and won a controversial split decision.
The WBC removed Casamayor's interim title when, instead of fighting a rematch with Santa Cruz, he signed to fight undefeated Michael Katsidis, the WBO interim lightweight titlist. On March 22, 2008, in a great battle, Casamayor became the first man to defeat the Australian Katsidis when he won the fight with a TKO in the 10th round. With the win, Casamayor retained his Ring Magazine world title and added the WBO interim championship to his collection. He is managed by Luis Decubas Jr. 
Casamayor vs. Marquez.
Casamayor was defeated by Juan Manuel Márquez on September 13, 2008. Marquez (49-4-1, 36 KOs) by Knockout in the 11th round at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, Paradise. In the first four rounds of the bout, Marquez continually walked into counter lefts from Casamayor. It took Marquez until the fifth round to be able to find the range with his right hand. By the fifth round, a cut over Casamayor's right eye was opened from a clash of heads. Rounds five, six, seven and eight were rounds where Marquez landed straight punches from the outside, but he was also nailed by Casamayor whenever he lunged forward. Two minutes into the eleventh round, Casamayor was knocked down by a right hand as he pulled away from an intense exchange. Casamayor got up and immediately tried to smother Marquez, but Marquez let his hands go in furious combination. Casamayor swung back, but he went down again with about 7 seconds left in the round. Referee Tony Weeks stepped in and stopped the fight before Casamayor had a chance to stand up again. This caused some anger from fans, however, Casamayor was gracious in defeat and said, "Marquez was the best this night." The official judges had the fight scored 95-95, 95-95, and 97-93 for Marquez.
Casamayor is a unionized boxer, a member of the Joint Association of Boxers.
Comeback.
On November 6, 2009, Casamayor beat Jason Davis by unanimous decision.
Casamayor fought Mexican American Robert Guerrero at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, on July 31, 2010. The 10 round bout was an undercard of the Juan Manuel Marquez vs. Juan Diaz II event. The 39 year old pugilist lost the match by unanimous decision: 98–89, 98–89, 97–90. Guerrero rocked Casamayor throughout the fight, sending him down in the second round. The Cuban got up and looked exhausted after two rounds. He recovered in the next rounds but Guerrero continued to put pressure, landing several combinations and outboxing him. In the last minute of the final round, the Cuban engaged on the offensive, with Guerrero being knocked down for the first time in his professional career.

Sam Cook

Cecil "Sam" Cook (23 August 1921 – 4 September 1996) was an English cricketer who played for Gloucestershire and in one Test match for England.
Life and career.
Born in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, Cook was a small and stocky slow left-arm spinner, who emerged unexpectedly after World War II when Gloucestershire had lost Tom Goddard’s former partner Reg Sinfield. Wally Hammond saw him in the nets during the spring, and took Cook on immediately with great expectations that were amply fulfilled. Cook, who was never known by his given name, took a wicket with his first ball in first-class cricket, and 133 wickets in the 1946 season, when he played in the Test Trial. No great spinner of the ball, Cook relied on accuracy and flight: if he lacked penetration as a bowler, he was also very rarely mastered. In the following year with the Bristol pitch – which had caused little satisfaction for its tendency to be either a spinners’ (as in 1939) or a batsman's (as in 1946) paradise – being reconditioned with a sand dressing, Cook offered superb support to Goddard to form to most difficult bowling attack in the country. Cook was called into the England team to play the South Africans on the batsman's pitch at Trent Bridge in 1947, after taking six South African wickets in the second innings of the MCC match in May. However, in the Test match, he took no wickets for 127 runs, scored 0 and 4, and was never picked again. The Kent fast bowler Jack Martin, who had done equally well in the MCC match, was also picked for the Trent Bridge Test, also fared badly, and was likewise discarded, never to appear in Test cricket again. In 1948, with the Bristol pitch dressed with loam instead of sand, Cook declined considerably and never threatened the superbly-skilled Australian batsmen, and in 1949 he took until August to recapture any sort of form.
Cook took 139 wickets in 1950, but by this time Johnny Wardle, Malcolm Hilton and later Tony Lock – all far better batsmen and fieldsmen – were able to prevent him from having the slightest chance of returning to Test cricket. Owing to the loss of Goddard, Cook faltered a little between 1951 and 1955, but the very wet summer and dry spring of 1956 allowed him to form a devastating combination with Bomber Wells that led Cook to his best season ever with 149 wickets for less than fifteen runs apiece, including an amazing ten for 35 against Worcestershire and thirteen for 121 against Nottinghamshire. The following two seasons were moderate, but with the newly found spinning riches of John Mortimore and David Allen, Gloucestershire acquired the most formidable bowling attack in the country during the brilliant summer of 1959, with Cook "making full use of his wealth of experience". In this period Gloucestershire, as in the days of Parker, Goddard and Sinfield, often played three spinners, right up to the time when Cook retired in 1964. However, despite heading the first-class bowling averages for the only time in 1962, Cook's extreme weakness with the bat and in the field saw him left out of many matches even in that season and on grassier pitches the switch in emphasis to seam bowling made things even tougher for Cook as he grew older.
In all first-class cricket, Cook took 1,782 wickets, making him 50th on the all-time list. No batsman at all, he scored fewer than 2,000 first-class runs and never reached 40 in an innings. After retirement, he stood as a first-class umpire until 1986.
Sam Cook died in his hometown of Tetbury in September 1996, at the age of 75.

<doc id="2878172" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2878172" title="Day labor">
Day labor

Day labor (or day labour in Commonwealth spelling) is work done where the worker is hired and paid one day at a time, with no promise that more work will be available in the future. It is a form of contingent work.
Types.
Day laborers find work through three common routes. 
Firstly, some employment agencies specialize in very short-term contracts for manual labor most often in construction, factories, offices, and manufacturing. These companies usually have offices where workers can arrive and be assigned to a job on the spot, as they are available. 
Secondly, a manager looking for additional labor to fill an unexpected change in plans is presented with a problem of finding the needed quantity of labor with the right skills. Imagine the magnitude of the task of looking for workers, on the side of the street or by calling various employment agencies, who can verify that they are journeyman asphalt rakers, typists, programmers, etc. The benefit of representation is applied to both the labor and employer. Labor is given a source of recourse to achieve a safe work environment free of favoritism and arbitrary work assignments. Employers benefit from organized labor training programs, benefit plans, dispute resolution and a labor supply meeting most employers labor demand at most any time or place. The benefit of a labor supply arriving at a specified time and location within less than a day's notice is reduced overhead resources.
Thirdly and less formally, workers meet at well-known locations, usually public street corners or commercial parking lots, and wait for building contractors, landscapers, home owners and small business owners, and other potential employers to offer work. Much of this work is in small residential construction or landscaping. These workers earn, on average, $8–$10 an hour. The media and a study by UCLA portrays day laborers as being illegal immigrants from Mexico and Central America, who otherwise can't get work due to current employment regulations. Other research has found that day laborers are not typically illegal immigrants, many even being citizens of the US, and that day labor is often a transition to full-time work.
In the United States.
Informal day labor is not new to the United States, and day laborers are not always migrant workers in many cases. In his study of day laborers in Atlanta, Terry Easton interviews white and black day laborers in addition to Hispanic workers. Many other metropolitan areas still have non-immigrant day laborers, and many other large and small cities have immigrant day laborers from a variety of countries, including Mongolia, Poland, Russia, Brazil, Central and South America, and countries in Africa. Non-immigrant informal day labor, seen in many cities, does not generate the controversy or calls to police and local government seen when immigrant day laborers gather to wait for work. 
Unorganized day labor creates real problems for day laborers: 1 in 3 corner day laborers have experienced theft of wages in the past two months; 1 in 5 experienced a serious worksite injury in the past year. Low wages and poor working conditions, employer abuse, and lack of insurance for work related accidents is common.
Numerous complaints are made about immigrant day laborers. These include loitering, noise, crime and rushing cars of potential employers in parking lots. Cities and counties have tried a variety of solutions with varied success. Some municipalities and communities have supported workers' efforts to organize themselves into democratically run workers' centers, designated areas, and organizations to defend workers' rights in general. Workers' Centers of this kind date back at least 18 years to Los Angeles. Other municipalities have targeted day labor sites for aggressive enforcement of immigration laws.
Though united in their commitment to the rights of immigrant workers, NDLON and the Day Labor Research Institute represent two very different models of day labor center. NDLON represents the "social service agency model" and the Institute the "day laborer designed model." These different models of day labor centers may yield markedly different results that reflect the different goals of each model. 
Problems when workers' centers are established are also common: day laborers often continue to congregate in large numbers on the streets surrounding the day labor centers, refusing to leave the street and use the center; new problems can be created, including new crowds of homeless and substance abusers loitering near the center after hours, and large numbers of day laborers drawn from other areas to the streets surrounding the centers. Low levels of work at the centers, low wages, and problems with the job distribution system are also common.

Penult

A penult (short for "penultimate") is the next to the last item in a series. The commonest use of the word is in linguistics, where the word "penult" usually means the second to last syllable of a word. The penult follows the antepenult and precedes the ultima. For example, the main stress falls on the penult in such English words as "banána", and "Mississíppi". Occasionally, "penult" refers to the last word but one of a sentence.
The terms are often used in reference to languages like Latin and Ancient Greek, where the position of the pitch accent or stress of a word only falls on one of the last three syllables and is determined by rules, and sometimes in discussing poetic meter.

Golden Axe Warrior

Golden Axe Warrior is an action-adventure game released on the Sega Master System in 1991 and a spin-off of the popular "Golden Axe" video game series. The game follows a young warrior who tries to avenge the death of his parents by exploring ten labyrinths, collecting nine missing crystals and battling with the evil tyrant Death Adder. Players must cross a large world, fight enemies, seek mysterious labyrinths, fight bosses, and obtain the crystals that are guarded by many monsters. All the playable characters from the original "Golden Axe" make cameo appearances.
"Golden Axe Warrior " received mostly negative reviews on release, with critics remarking that it had little to do with the arcade original. The game has instead drawn comparisons to "The Legend of Zelda" for the NES, with which it shares several key gameplay elements.
Plot.
The evil giant, Death Adder, has invaded the countries of Firewood, Nendoria and Altorulia and killed the royal families. A young hero from Firewood sets out on a quest to destroy the giant. To counter Adder's evil magic he needs to find the nine crystals of the royal family from Firewood. These crystals warded off Death Adder until the king was betrayed by a minister who sold the crystals to Adder. Death Adder has hidden the crystals in nine labyrinths. On his quest the hero visits numerous villages and discovers numerous people hiding from Death Adder. He can learn the Thunder, Earth, Fire and Water magics. He learns that the princess of Firewood is still alive and that he is the son of the king of Altorulia. After finding all nine crystals the hero is able to enter the tenth and final labyrinth where he must find the mythical Golden Axe, the only weapon that can harm Death Adder, before facing the giant himself.
Gameplay.
Players take control of the game's hero, who can be named at the start of a new quest. The game features a large overworld with over 200 unique screens and many enemies. Players must retrieve each of the game's nine crystals by locating hidden labyrinths. Each labyrinth is guarded by monsters and full of puzzles that must be solved in order to reach the boss and retrieve the crystal. Throughout the game, players collect various items and abilities that allow access to previously unreachable areas. The tenth labyrinth is only accessible after collecting the nine crystals. Players must then find the Golden Axe and use it to defeat Death Adder.
Weapons and armor can be upgraded and several magic abilities can be learned. Using magic requires the use of pots which are depleted after every use. The game's currency is horns collected from enemies; these horns can be spent in towns throughout the game. Hidden areas can be uncovered by chopping down trees with an axe or clearing rocks using Earth magic.
Release.
The game is considered to be one of the system's rarest games. It is included as an unlockable game in "Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection" for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
Reception.
"Golden Axe Warrior" was not well received on release. Reviews pointed out that the game was vastly different from the original "Golden Axe", including one in Sega Pro, which rated "Golden Axe Warrior" a 67%. Computer and Video Games also pointed out the difference, calling it an "incredibly dull RPG." Reviewers in Mean Machines called it "boring" and "tedious", recommending "" and "Lord of the Sword" instead.
IGN mentioned the game in its article "A History of Gaming's Most Shameless Rip-Offs", calling it a rip-off of "The Legend of Zelda". They noted similarities in enemies, map designs and called the soundtrack "eerily similar" to "Zelda" but without any of the personality.

Delta Arae

Delta Arae (δ Arae, δ Ara) is the Bayer designation for a double star in the southern constellation Ara. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.62 and is visible to the naked eye. Based upon an annual parallax of 16.48 mas, it is about distant from the Earth.
Delta Arae is massive B-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of B8 Vn. The 'n' suffix indicates the absorption lines are spread out broadly because the star is spinning rapidly. It has a projected rotational velocity of 255 km/s, resulting in an equatorial bulge with a radius 13% larger than the polar radius. It has a magnitude 9.5 companion G-type main sequence star that may form a binary star system with Delta Arae.
There is a 12th magnitude optical companion located 47.4 arcseconds away along a position angle of 313°.
Etymology.
Delta Arae was known as (meaning: "the 3rd (star) of """) in traditional Chinese astronomy.
Allen erroneously called it with ζ Arae as "Tseen Yin" (). He probably confused constellation "Ara" with "Ari". "Tseen Yin" was lain in Aries.

Majd al-Dawla

Abu Taleb Rostam (), known as Majd al-Dawla, was the Buyid emir of Rayy, a city in Iran (997–1029). He was the eldest son of Fakhr al-Dawla. His reign saw the removal of the Buyids as a power in central Iran.
Biography.
Abu Taleb Rostam succeeded his father upon the latter's death in 997, and was given the "laqab" of "Majd al-Dawla". At the time he was four years old. His younger brother, Abu Taher ("Shams al-Dawla"), meanwhile, became the ruler of Hamadan. Since both brothers were in the age of minority, power was assumed by their mother Sayyida Shirin. Both sons initially declared themselves independent and assumed the title of Shâhanshâh, but by 1009 or 1010 at the latest had recognized the authority of Baha' al-Dawla, who controlled Fars and Iraq, and abandoned the title.
In 1006 or 1007, with the assistance of his vizier Abu 'Ali ibn 'Ali, Majd al-Dawla attempted to throw off the regency of his mother. Sayyida, however, escaped to the Kurd Abu Najr Badr ibn Hasanuya, and together with Shams al-Dawla they put Ray under siege. After several battles, the city was taken and Majd al-Dawla was captured. He was imprisoned by his mother in the fort of Tabarak, while Shams al-Dawla took to power in Ray. After a year, Majd al-Dawla was released and reinstated in Ray; Shams al-Dawla returned to Hamadan. Power continued to be held by his mother.
Majd al-Dawla's reign saw the gradual shriking of Buyid holdings in central Iran; Gorgan and Tabaristan had been lost to the Ziyarids in 997, while several of the western towns were seized by the Sallarids of Azerbaijan. Sayyida later prevented Shams al-Dawla from seizing Ray from Majd al-Dawla. In ca. 1015, Majd al-Dawla, who was suffering melancholia, was treated by the famous Persian scholar Avicenna.
Ibn Fuladh, a Dailamite military officer, who claimed Qazvin for himself, revolted against Majd al-Dawla in 1016. Majd al-Dawla, however, refused to make him governor of Qazvin, which made Ibn Fuladh threaten him around the countryside of his capital in Ray. Majd al-Dawla then requested the aid of his vassal, the Bavandid ruler Abu Ja'far Muhammad, who managed to defeat Ibn Fuladh and repel him from Ray. Ibn Fuladh then requested aid from the Ziyarid ruler Manuchihr. Ibn Fuladh agreed to become Manuchihr's vassal in return for his aid. The following year, a combined army of Ibn Fuladh and Manuchihr besieged Ray, which forced Majd al-Dawla to make Ibn Fuladh the governor of Isfahan. However, the Kakuyid ruler Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar, who was a Buyid vassal king of Isfahan, defeated Ibn Fuladh, possibly killing him during the battle. Shams al-Dawla later died in 1021 and was succeeded by his son Sama' al-Dawla.
The fragility of Majd al-Dawla's kingdom later encouraged Muhammad to extend his domains in the Kurdish held mountains of Iran. In 1023, Muhammad seized Hamadan from Sama' al-Dawla, and then proceeded to capture Dinavar and Khorramabad from its Kurdish leaders. He spent the following years in protecting his realm from invasions by the Kurds and princes (ispahbadh) from Tabaristan.
Five years later, Majd al-Dawla sent a combined Buyid-Bavand army under Abu Ja'far Muhammad and his two sons against Muhammad. Muhammad, however, managed win a great victory over the Buyid-Bavand army at Nahavand, and managed to capture Abu Ja'far including his two sons. After this great victory, Muhammad consolidated his position as the strongest ruler of Jibal, even though Majd al-Dawla was his overlord, Muhammad minted coins in his own name. He was later personally awarded, and without the intervention of the Buyids, from the Caliph Abbasid Al-Qadir, the title of "Ḥusām Amīr-al-muʾmenīn" (Sword of the Commander of the Faithful).
Death.
When Sayyida died in 1028, the consequences of the political seclusion of Majd al-Dawla became apparent. He was soon faced with a revolt by his Dailamite soldiers, and requested the assistance of Mahmud of Ghazni in dealing with them. Mahmud came to Ray, deposed Majd al-Dawla as ruler, and sacked the city, bringing an end to Buyid rule there. One of his sons, Fana-Khusrau, would attempt to restore the power of the Buyids in the following years, but failed.

Pelindaba

Pelindaba is South Africa's main Nuclear Research Centre, run by The South African Nuclear Energy Corporation and was the location where South Africa's atomic bombs of the 1970s were developed, constructed and subsequently stored. It is situated near the Hartbeespoort Dam, approximately 33 km (22 miles) west of Pretoria, on the farm that once belonged to Gustav Preller.
History.
The research reactor SAFARI-1 has operated since 1965, with an output of up to 20 MW. A 4 MV Van de Graaff particle accelerator operates for various purposes in nuclear sciences.
The South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (NECSA) was established as a public company by the Republic of South Africa in 1999.
Accidents.
1996 accident.
An accident at the Pelindaba research facility exposed workers to radiation. Harold Daniels and several others died from radiation burns and cancers related to the exposure.
Leak in 2009.
On the 16th of March, 2009, a leak of radioactive gases from Pelindaba was reported by NECSA. Abnormal levels of gamma radiation associated with xenon and krypton gases were detected, causing an emergency to be declared. Members of staff were evacuated. 
Armed attack on the facility.
Shortly after midnight on 8 November 2007, four armed men entered the facility and headed towards a control room in the eastern block. According to the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (NECSA), the state-owned entity that runs the facility, the four "technically sophisticated criminals" deactivated several layers of security, including a 10,000-volt electrical fence, suggesting insider knowledge of the system. An off-duty emergency services officer, who was shot by the men after a brief struggle, triggered an alarm, alerting a nearby police station. The four attackers escaped the facility by the same way they had entered after 45 minutes alone in the compound. Though their images were captured on closed-circuit television, they were not detected by security officers because nobody was monitoring the cameras at the time. On 16 November, three suspects, between the ages of 17 and 28, were arrested by local police in connection with the incident but were later released. In response to the attack, NECSA suspended six Pelindaba security personnel, including the general manager of security and promised an "internal investigation which will cover culpability, negligence and improvements of Security Systems."

Tetrapropylammonium perruthenate

Tetrapropylammonium perruthenate (TPAP or TPAPR) is the chemical compound described by the formula N(C3H7)4RuO4. Sometimes known as the Ley–Griffith reagent, this ruthenium compound is used as a reagent in organic synthesis. This salt consists of the tetrapropylammonium cation and the perruthenate, RuO4− anion. Ruthenium tetroxide is a highly aggressive oxidant, but its one-electron reduced derivative is a mild oxidizing agent for the conversion of alcohols to aldehydes. This oxidizing agent can also be used to oxidize primary alcohols all the way to the carboxylic acid. Use of a higher catalyst loading, larger amount of the co-oxidant, and addition of two equivalents of water. In this situation, the aldehyde reacts with water to form the geminal-diol hydrate, which is then oxidized again.
The oxidation generates water that can be removed by adding molecular sieves. TPAP is expensive, but it can be used in catalytic amounts. The catalytic cycle is maintained by adding a stoichiometric amount of a co-oxidant such as "N"-methylmorpholine "N"-oxide or molecular oxygen.

Leith Athletic F.C.

Leith Athletic Football Club are a football club based in the Leith area of Edinburgh, Scotland. It is a member of the East of Scotland Football League. It plays most of its home games at Leith Links. The club was originally formed in 1887 and played in the Scottish Football League in four different spells between 1897 and 1953, but went out of business in 1955. A new club of the same name was formed in 1996, primarily for youth teams. In 2008, it took the place of Edinburgh Athletic in the East of Scotland Football League.
History.
Original club.
Leith Athletic were founded in 1887 in the Port of Leith. In 1891, Leith replaced Glasgow side Cowlairs in the Scottish Football League. After a reasonable start (fourth out of 12 in 1892), Leith had to apply for re-election in 1894 and 1895. They received only three votes in the latter year and were relegated to the Second Division. Leith fared rather better in the second flight, finishing second in 1896, 1897 and 1899, but they could not muster enough votes to be elected back into the First Division. In 1905, having failed once again in the end of 1905 season voting, Leith Athletic were wound up and a new limited company formed to take over the old club's assets.
In 1891, Robert Clements and Mathew McQueen played for Scotland against Ireland in Glasgow, McQueen having played a year earlier against Wales at Underwood Park in Paisley. Geordie Anderson, James Blessington and Robert Laing would represent the Scottish Football League against the Scottish Alliance League and the Irish League in the 1892-93 season. John Blessington was transferred to Celtic in June 1893 for £20, and would gain four caps for Scotland against England and Ireland.
Now playing as Leith F.C., the team comfortably won the Scottish Second Division championship in 1906. Despite this triumph, they failed to be elected to the First Division, as runners-up Clyde and fourth placed Hamilton Academical were preferred. Leith and Raith Rovers finished level on points and were declared joint champions in 1910. Raith were promoted, but it appears that Leith did not contest the elections. The 1912-13 season saw Leith finish in last position and won re-election to stay in the league. They survived until the competition was suspended in 1915 and they joined the Eastern League.
Leith closed down for the duration of the First World War in 1916. When the club was reformed in 1919, the old name of Leith Athletic was revived and the club joined the Western League. After playing for one season in the Scottish Alliance (1923–24), Leith were admitted to the Third Division in 1924. Leith won the Third Division championship in 1926, but failed to win election to the Second Division. The club were eliminated on the chairman’s casting vote in the third ballot. It was becoming apparent that the two most prominent Edinburgh clubs, Heart of Midlothian and Hibernian were blocking attempts by Leith to progress.
The abolition of the Third Division meant that Leith had to rejoin the Scottish Alliance, but in 1927 they were admitted into the Scottish League, replacing Nithsdale Wanderers. The club's fortunes improved and they won the Second Division championship in 1930 and promotion to the First Division. Leith survived in the top division in 1931, but were relegated in 1932. The club were a middle-ranking Second Division side until the league was suspended in 1939-40.
An attempt in 1945 to revive St Bernard's, who had lost their ground in 1943 through a merger with Leith Athletic came to nothing. In 1946, Leith became founder members of the new Division C (third tier). The Second Division was expanded from 14 to 16 clubs in 1947, and Leith were elected to one of the vacancies. They were relegated in 1948, however, when the third tier was split, Leith joined Division C (North & East).
The C Divisions were made up largely of reserve teams and Leith campaigned for the non-reserve teams to be included in the Second Division. They were not successful and were expelled in August 1953, when they refused to play any more fixtures in Division C. It was too late for the club to join another competition and the club went out of business in 1955. In a supreme irony, the two C Divisions were abandoned that summer and, just as Leith had wanted, the non-reserve sides were admitted to the Second Division.
Modern club.
A new Leith Athletic was formed in 1996, primarily as a club for boys football, with teams at various age groups between the ages of 5 and 21, whilst the club's adult side joined the Central Scottish Amateur Football League. In 2005, they attained their first Scottish amateur international, when Paul Lee played in a 2-1 win against Leinster. In the same year, Danny Swanson, Douglas Thom and Shaun Woodburn were capped for the Scottish Youth Football Association under-19 team, playing against Mid Ulster and Wales.
Leith Athletic amalgamated with Edinburgh Athletic in 2008 and took its place in the East of Scotland Football League. Leith were promoted to the East of Scotland Premier Division in 2011.
Ground.
At the time of their election to the Scottish Football League in 1891, Leith played at Bank Park, which was renamed Beechwood Park in 1895. After the end of the 1898–99 season the club moved to St Bernards' New Logie Green, where they played two league matches before moving to Hawkhill for the remainder of the 1899–1900 season.
Between 1900 and 1904 Leith played at Chancelot Park, before moving to Old Logie Green. After the SFL was suspended during World War II the club played some matches at Chancelot Park and Wardie Park. When the club returned to the SFL in 1924 they returned to Old Logie Green. At the end of the 1925–26 season the club moved again, this time to New Powderhall. 
After only a season at New Powederhall, the club moved to Marine Gardens, where they remained until moving to Meadowbank in 1936. After World War II the ground required rebuilding, and Leith spent the 1946–47 season at the adjacent New Meadowbank. When the original Meadowbank was reopened, it was renamed Old Meadowbank.

Non liquet

In law, a non liquet is a situation where there is no applicable law. "Non liquet" translates into English from Latin as "it is not clear." According to Cicero, the term was applied during the Roman Republic to a verdict of "not proven" where the guilt or innocence of the accused was "not clear." Lacuna is a related word which means "gap, void, defect, want, or loss" and is used to indicate a gap in the law.
That is to say, a court comes to the conclusion that the situation engaged in a case has no answer from the governing system of law. This is of particular relevance to international law since international courts, be it the ICJ or ad hoc tribunals, cannot invent law to redress a "lacuna". As has now become the practice, the last resort that can be taken recourse to in deciding contentious cases is the widely accepted law of civilized nations (see generally Barcelona Traction, as accepting the doctrine of estoppel as part of international law). The ex aequo et bono jurisdiction has to date never been accepted by states, and it is believed that states would never accept it. Thus, absence of determinable international law leads to the court declaring something "non liquet". But it has been argued by many that invoking of the "non liquet" doctrine is opposed to the notion of law being a complete (and autonomous) system. Note that municipal courts enforcing international law are not constrained to declare an area "non liquet".

Rot Weiss Ahlen

Rot Weiss Ahlen is a German football club based in Ahlen, North Rhine-Westphalia. Until 2006 the club was known as "LR Ahlen" for its major sponsor, but underwent a name change when the sponsor withdrew its support after the team was relegated to the Regionalliga (III) in that year.
History.
The club has its roots in the local sides of the early 1900s formed by coalminers who played pickup games after work. In 1917, "Freie Sportclub Union (FSCU) Ahlen" was founded and became one of the region's best known teams, playing in the second tier leagues of the time. The rise of the Third Reich saw the club disbanded as over three-quarters of its members were foreigners making the side politically unpalatable to the regime. A new club, "Tus Germania Ahlen", was formed in 1933. This side merged with the strong local club "Wacker Ahlen" to create the town's largest sports association.
After World War II attempts to rebuild local teams failed until members of eight pre-war clubs came together to form TuS Ahlen in 1948. The new side went on to many decades of routine play in the local upper leagues. In 1991 they were faced with a financial crisis and demotion to lower level play. A local benefactor, Helmut Spikker, helped bail the team out through the support provided by his firm, cosmetics manufacturer LR International.
Now on a firm footing "TuS Ahlen" enjoyed an impressive run of success through the early 90s beginning with a Berzirksliga Westfalen (VII) title in 1992 and promotion to the Landesliga Westfalen (VI). In each of the following three seasons "TuS" earned another championship and promotion; out of the Landesliga, through the Verbandsliga Westfalen-Nordost (V) and Oberliga Westfalen (IV), leading to the Regionalliga West/Südwest (III).
"Leichtathletik Rasensport Ahlen" was formed on 1 June 1996 when "TuS Ahlen" merged with "Blau-Weiß Ahlen" to begin play in the Regionalliga West/Südwest in 1996–97. The club's rise was stalled and they made a bid again move up by signing a number of players with Bundesliga experience for 1998–99. However, they could only manage a sixth place finish and subsequently unloaded their expensive talent. Living more within their means, the side earned promotion with a second place result in 1999–2000 and a 2–1 victory over "1. FC Union Berlin" in the playoff round to advance to the 2. Bundesliga. "Ahlen"'s best result came in their debut in the second tier when they ended sixth. The team slipped to become a lower tier side and lingered for another five seasons before a 17th place result led to their demotion in 2006.
After being relegated "LR Ahlen" lost the support of its major sponsor and underwent a name change to become "Rot Weiss Ahlen" on 31 May 2006. Chairman Spikker also left the club at the end of August with his successor being vice-president Heinz-Jürgen Gosda. The team returned to 2. Bundesliga play after finishing as champions of the Regionalliga Nord in 2007–08. With the end of the 2009-10 season, "Ahlen" was relegated to the 3. Liga, and the following year to the fifth NRW-Liga despite a 17th place finish outside the drop down zone because of insolvency.

Whitaker Wright

James Whitaker Wright (9 February 1846 – 26 January 1904) was a company promoter and swindler, who committed suicide at the Royal Courts of Justice in London immediately following his conviction for fraud.
Early life.
The eldest of five children, he was the son of James Wright, a Methodist Minister, and Matilda Whitaker, a tailor's daughter. He was born in Stafford, and spent his early years in various parts of England with his father. In 1861, according to the census of that year, he was a printer in Ripon. Between 1866 and 1868, he was a Methodist preacher himself, but retired due to ill health. He was also the elder brother of John Joseph Wright, who invented the reversible trolley pole in Toronto, Canada.
Emigration, marriage and fortune.
On the death of his father in 1870, the family emigrated to Toronto, Canada. Wright then travelled to Philadelphia, US where he met and married Anna Edith Weightman in 1878. Wright made a fortune by promoting silver-mining companies in Leadville, Colorado and Lake Valley, New Mexico, although none of the companies made money for the shareholders.
Wright returned to England, and promoted a multitude of Australian and Canadian mining companies on the London market.
Sharp practices.
Wright's career as a swindler peaked in the 1890s, when he formed the London and Globe Company which floated a variety of stock and bond issues dealing with mining. Wright called some of these stocks "consols", the term used by the British government for state bond issues that were solid and reliable. He loaded the directorships of his companies with Peers of the Realm; for instance, the Chairman of the London and Globe Company was the Marquess of Dufferin and Ava, a former Viceroy of India. This served the purpose both of impressing the public and attracting wealthy investors. Wright also sought to make a place for himself in late Victorian English Society. Besides a mansion at Lea Park, Surrey, where he had a smoking room built beneath a roof aquarium, Wright also owned the yacht "Sybarita" which beat the yacht "Meteor" (which belonged to Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany) before the Royal Yacht Squadron.
Wright became a friend and financial advisor to Sir James Reid, the personal physician to Queen Victoria. In fact Reid became the trustee for Mrs. Wright in the financier's will; later this would lead to financial difficulties for the physician for neglecting her interests in the events connected to Wright's fall. Reid eventually had to pay Mrs. Wright £5,000.
Everything was apparently working well in Wright's empire, when in 1900 he sought to float a bond issue for the building of the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (now the London Underground's Bakerloo line). The line had been difficult and costly to construct. Why Wright sought to get involved in the company is contentious; he was a mining engineer, not a construction or railroad engineer. It is likely that Wright believed he would be able to cap his career in City finance if he were knighted for his public spirited activity. In any case the bond issue was a disaster - Wright found it strained his resources, and few people were willing to subscribe. It started the collapse of the entire Wright group.
At this point Wright made his criminal error. To maintain an image of solvency and success, Wright kept pushing thousands of pounds from one of his companies to another in a series of "loans". This led to some misrepresentations on balance sheets. But when he announced that, despite the apparent prosperity of his group, there would be no dividends, people became suspicious. In December 1900, the companies collapsed. Wright fled, but was brought back to stand trial.
The shock waves led to a panic in London's exchange. There were other losses. The humiliated Marquess of Dufferin and Ava died in 1902 in the midst of the investigation.
Trial and death.
The trial took place in January 1904, before Mr. Justice Bigham; the prosecution was led by one of the best barristers of the day Rufus Isaacs. Bigham was one of the most astute corporate law experts in England, and Isaacs was an expert in stock market procedure having previously worked as a broker. The government (when studying the confusion of Wright's paper trail) could not see a successful government prosecution; instead the prosecution was brought by the stockholders. With a prosecutor exposing the various financial tricks that Wright pulled for the jury, and a jurist patiently explaining points about finance, Wright's attempts at obfuscation were defeated.
On 26 January 1904, Wright was convicted of fraud at the Royal Courts of Justice and given a seven year prison sentence. He committed suicide by swallowing cyanide in a court anteroom immediately afterward. The inquest also revealed that he had been carrying a revolver in his pocket, presumably as a backup: he was never searched as the security was weaker at the Royal Courts, which were of course Civil Courts, the trial being held there as it was deemed likelier that the special jury required would be less prejudiced against the accused than a normal jury at the Old Bailey criminal court, which was in the City. In spite of his financial errors, there was a great outburst of grief at his funeral at Witley where he is buried.
Witley Park.
In 1890 Wright had purchased an estate named Lea Park between Godalming and Haslemere, Surrey, and the adjacent South Park Farm from the Earl of Derby, which included the Lordship of the Manor and control of Hindhead Common and the Devil's Punch Bowl. Whitaker Wright began to develop his new properties as a single estate, and his wide-ranging landscaping works, creating three lakes, the largest of which covered fifty acres of farmland raised local concerns regarding the impact they were having on the local economy and the natural landscape. In the vastly extended house he had a subterranean smoking room built beneath a roof aquarium 
Following his death, Lea Park was purchased by William, Lord Pirrie; the now-notorious name was changed to Witley Park, as the estate was further extended towards Witley, Surrey. Farmsteads were cleared away to create a deer park. The remainder of the estate was divided into lots for sale, and funds raised locally enabled the purchase of Hindhead Common, which was transferred to the National Trust.
In popular culture.
Whitaker Wright was popularized along with his fictional great-grandson in a 2006 episode of "Hustle" titled .
H. G. Wells was fascinated by the fall of Wright, and it influenced the writer's novels "Tono-Bungay" and "The World of William Clissold".

Sir Geoffrey James Warnock (16 August 1923 – 8 October 1995) was a philosopher and Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University. Before his knighthood (in the 1986 New Year Honours), he was commonly known as G. J. Warnock.
Life.
Warnock was born in Leeds, in northern England, and was educated at Winchester College. He then served with the Irish Guards until 1945, before entering New College, Oxford, with a classics scholarship. He was elected to a Fellowship at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1949. After spending three years at Brasenose College, he returned to Magdalen as a Fellow and tutor in philosophy. In 1970, he was elected to Principal of Hertford College, Oxford (1971–1988), where there is now a society and student house named after him. He was also the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford from 1981 to 1985.
Warnock and his co-editor J. O. Urmson performed an invaluable service to the development of "analytic" or "linguistic" philosophy by preparing for publication the papers of their friend and fellow Oxford linguistic philosopher J. L. Austin.
Warnock married Mary Warnock, a philosophy fellow of St Hugh's College, Oxford, and later Baroness Warnock, in 1949. They had two sons and three daughters. He retired to live near Marlborough, Wiltshire, in 1988 and died in 1995 at Axford in Wiltshire.

Booker's

Booker’s bourbon is one of the small batch bourbons produced by the Jim Beam distillery, which is owned by Beam Suntory (a subsidiary of Suntory Holdings of Osaka, Japan). Having the highest alcohol content of the brands in the Jim Beam "Small Batch Bourbon Collection", it is a cask strength bourbon. It was personally selected from barrels by Jim Beam's grandson, the late distiller emeritus Booker Noe. Noe originally bottled this straight-from-the-barrel bourbon as gifts to close friends and family, but eventually made it available to the general public, starting in 1992. Each barrel of Booker's bourbon was hand-selected by Noe and was aged at the center of the rackhouse, where the company says that the temperature and humidity are the most favorable for fine bourbons. Booker's bourbon is aged between six and eight years and is bottled un-cut and without chill filtering at its natural proof between 121 and 130.6. While it is not necessary to cut the bourbon with water, a splash or two of distilled water is recommended (by Booker Noe) to unlock some of the flavor.
In 2014, Jim Beam will release a limited edition 25th Anniversary Booker's Bourbon which has been extra aged to at least 10 years old. 
Booker’s has won some tasting awards, including Wine Enthusiast's Gold Medal Bourbon award.

Ann Magnuson

Ann Magnuson (born January 4, 1956) is an American actress, performance artist, and nightclub performer who first gained prominence in the 1985 film "Desperately Seeking Susan". "The New York Times" described her as "An endearing theatrical chameleon who has as many characters at her fingertips as Lily Tomlin does".
Early life and career.
Magnuson was born in Charleston, West Virginia to a journalist mother and a lawyer father. She had a brother, Bobby, who died in 1998 of complications from AIDS. She attended Holz Elementary and George Washington High School in Charleston. After graduating from Denison University in 1978, she moved to New York City, New York and was a DJ and performer at Club 57 and the Mudd Club in Manhattan circa 1979 through the early 1980s, while pursuing a performance career on varied fronts. She created such characters as "Anoushka", a Soviet lounge singer, wearing a wig backwards and singing mock-Russian lyrics to pop music standards, and separately sang in an all-girl percussion group, Pulsallama, whose 1982 single "The Devil Lives In My Husband's Body" was a housewife's lament of a spouse who appears to be possessed. Later, in the 1990s, Magnuson fronted the satirical faux-heavy metal band Vulcan Death Grip.
In an interview for the 2002 WETA-TV-PBS special "Lance Loud! A Death in An American Family", Magnuson credited the idea of Loud — a member of an all-American family filmed day-in/day-out for the landmark PBS documentary "An American Family", who came out as gay during the course of that documentary miniseries — with inspiring her to leave West Virginia for New York: 
Magnuson made her film debut in the 1982 film "Vortex".
In the late '70s and early '80s, Magnuson ran Club 57, in New York City's East Village. The club was located in the basement of the Polish National church. It became a center of a world that included Keith Haring, Kenny Scharf, and many others from New York's budding graffiti and downtown scenes. Club 57 was known for its theme nights such as Reggae Miniature Golf, or Model World of Glue Night.
Prominence.
A fixture of the Manhattan downtown club scene of the 1980s, Magnuson gained attention with her role as a snarky cigarette girl in director Susan Seidelman's independent film hit "Desperately Seeking Susan", set in that milieu and which also helped launch the acting career of singer Madonna. Magnuson went on to star in Seidelman's "Making Mr. Right" (1987), a poorly received science-fiction romance about an android played by John Malkovich.
Concurrently, Magnuson developed an underground following as lead vocalist of the band Bongwater, formed in 1985 with producer-musician Mark Kramer, a.k.a. Kramer. Bongwater released four avant garde albums and a debut EP before breaking up in 1992 with a contentious legal battle between Magnuson and Kramer that lasted through at least 1996 and ended with the bankruptcy of Kramer's independent-music label Shimmy-Disc.
Her 15-minute video performance piece "Made for Television", self-produced in 1981, ran on the WNET-PBS avant garde series "Alive from Off-Center". Her satiric featurette found her playing close to 50 roles in a "channel-hopping" series of visual bites parodying television programming game shows to TV-films to televangelists. As Art critic Sarah Valdez described it, "a bewigged Ann Magnuson consecutively inhabits, at a rate faster than any channel surfer could keep up with, an outlandish, uproariously unfortunate range of female stereotypes". It was later released by HBO Home Video together with the Cinemax cable-TV special "Vandemonium Plus" (1987), in which Magnuson starred in a mostly solo stage piece with appearances by actor-singer Meat Loaf and actor-monologist Eric Bogosian. Her 1995 CD "The Luv Show" (Geffen Records/MCA), her major-label debut, was commercially unsuccessful, but musically adventurous; one critic described it "an MGM musical as directed by Russ Meyer (which means the mambo 'Sex With The Devil'" and 'Miss Pussy Pants' sit comfortably next to Ethel Merman references in the same work)".
As "Salon" writer John Paczowski described her in 1997:
Later career.
From 1989 to 1992, Magnuson played Catherine Hughes, the comically hip editor-in-chief of a Chicago magazine in the television sitcom "Anything But Love", opposite Jamie Lee Curtis and comedian Richard Lewis, and played a liberal political commentator on comedian Wanda Sykes' 2003 Fox Broadcasting sitcom "Wanda at Large".
Magnuson's film roles have included a snarly real estate agent in "Panic Room", Alan's mother in "Small Soldiers", a madam in "Tank Girl", Mel Gibson's "money junkie" ex-wife in "Tequila Sunrise", Tom Berenger's estranged but horny ex-girlfriend in "Love at Large", a secretary in "Clear and Present Danger", and a sexy victim of David Bowie's vampire in "The Hunger".
Her TV guest appearances include an episode each of the Lifetime cable-network fiction-suspense anthology "The Hidden Room"; the cult-hit, surrealistic comedy-drama "The Adventures of Pete and Pete" and "Salute Your Shorts" on the children's cable television network Nickelodeon; the sitcoms "The John Larroquette Show", "The Drew Carey Show", "Caroline in the City", and "Frasier"; and the police procedural drama "". In the 1996 telefilm The Munsters' Scary Little Christmas, Magnuson played Lily Munster from the original 1960s TV series "The Munsters". She appeared in the 1990 Redd Kross music video for the song "Annie's Gone", written about her. As Toronto, Canada writer Jason Anderson summarized her work through 1996, "She's been appearing in various states of undress for artistic purposes since her performance art daze in late-'70s New York she was indie rock's thinking vixen..."
In 2003, Magnuson began touring a one-woman stage show, "Pretty Songs & Ugly Stories", that she mounted through at least July 2006. She played Sister Elizabeth Donderstock in the play "The Book of Liz," written by Amy Sedaris and David Sedaris, in May 2005 at the 2nd Stage Theatre in Hollywood, California.
Other theater work has included playwright John Patrick Shanley's "Four Dogs and a Bone" at the Lucille Lortel Theater in New York City, the one-woman shows "You Could Be Home Now" (which opened the 1990 Serious Fun festival at New York City's Lincoln Center), and "Rave Mom" (opened in New York City October 2001), and in a neo-burlesque show "The Velvet Hammer".
A "Village Voice" review described the autobiographical "Rave Mom" as Magnuson's "travels through 1999 — a year of Ecstasy-popping, bad romance-chasing and searching for escapism and meaning after her brother's death from AIDS. Magnuson has a thoroughly charming presence her stories of celebrity-studded Oscar parties, kid-filled raves, a wealthy dotcom suitor, and so on, come off as utterly self-absorbed and trivial..."
She has performed at the Revlon/UCLA Breast Center benefit-show series "What A Pair!" in 2005, performing with Elaine Hendrix "Tips" from the musical "Pump Boys & Dinettes", and 2006, performing with Samantha Shelton. She appeared in "What's My Line? Live on Stage" in Los Angeles on Sept 14, 2006.
For eight years Magnuson wrote a monthly column, "LA Woman", in the magazine "Paper", as well as an accompanying blog.
In late 2006, Ann Magnuson released her second solo album, "Pretty Songs & Ugly Stories" on Asphodel Records. It was produced and cowritten by long-time musical director and accompanist, Kristian Hoffman, with whom Ann has had a creative relationship since meeting him when she directed "The New Wave Vaudeville Show" in 1976.
In 2007 and 2008, Magnuson performed in a cabaret act, "Dueling Harps", with Adam Dugas, Mia Theodoratus, and Alexander Rannie.
In 2009, Magnuson created a one-woman performance piece, "Back Home Again (Dreaming Of Charleston)", that was commissioned by Charleston, West Virginia's FestiVall.
Personal life.
Magnuson married architect John Bertram in 2002. She has described the Eastside Los Angeles neighborhood of Silver Lake, where she lives in her Richard Neutra-designed house, as "a rainbow-coalition Mayberry ... You don't get a sense of anybody really flaunting how rich they are."
Quotes.
Magnuson on nihilistically violent films such as "Se7en" and music videos such as Smashing Pumpkins' "Bullet with Butterfly Wings": "I hate these whiny, middle-class kids co-opting people's real suffering. Videos ripping off news photography of people in the Third World! I mean, we live like czars. ... When I see my friends lying in caskets and put in the ground, when you're really confronted with it, it's not cool, it's not Trent Reznor. I'd just like to make something beautiful. It's something to aspire to."

Wallace, Nova Scotia

Wallace is a Canadian rural community in Cumberland County, Nova Scotia.
History.
Originally called Remsheg, meaning "the place between" in the Mi'kmaq language. The homes of the Acadians who lived in the village were burned as part of the Bay of Fundy Campaign (1755) during the French and Indian War. Wallace and near-by Tatamagouche, Nova Scotia were the first villages in Acadia to be burned because they were the gateway through which Acadians supplied the French Fortress Louisbourg.
Fourteen other ranks of the Royal Fencible American Regiment took up land grants in Remsheg following the American Revolutionary War.
Scottish immigrants followed and the village was renamed Wallace in honour of Scottish folk hero William Wallace as well as the first colonial treasurer of Nova Scotia, Michael Wallace.
The village is located at the mouth of the Wallace River where it meets Wallace Bay on the Northumberland Strait. Wallace Harbour is deep and straight, at one time being used by large ships hauling lumber and quarry stone. The Wallace River is a major river in northern Cumberland County and was once home to quarries and lumber mills and used to transport their products by sailing ships. Many of these ships were built in Wallace and surrounding areas.
Construction of the Montreal and European Short Line Railway Company began on the north shore of Nova Scotia in 1888, with the aim being to link Oxford with Pictou and onward to a superport under consideration for Canso. The section between Oxford and Pictou opened in 1890 and was known as the "Short Line" - in reference to the shorter distance between New Brunswick and Pictou County, rather than following the main line south from New Brunswick to Truro. Wallace's importance as a shipping port, quarrying industries, and small-scale manufacturing saw a spur line built from the Short Line at Wallace Station, approximately 3 kilometres inland, to the south of the village.
By the post-war years, Wallace's importance for marine traffic declined and its small shipping port fell into disrepair -- the Canadian Coast Guard even began decommissioning its lighthouses there. The railway connection was removed and rail service in the area was abandoned in the mid-1980s. The village's primary mode of transportation is by automobile and the village is situated on Trunk 6 which hosts a scenic route named the Sunrise Trail.
Today.
Wallace remains a small service centre for northeastern Cumberland County and has an elementary school, volunteer fire department, several stores and businesses, and a community hall. There is also an excellent recreation complex including a tennis court, basketball court, baseball field and outdoor ice rink. 
There are Anglican, Presbyterian and United Church of Canada churches as well as the Wallace-and-Area Museum.
Wallace is famous for its sandstone quarries. Wallace sandstone has a marked olive hue and can be found in many buildings around the Maritimes and eastern Canada. Originally used for foundations, breakwaters and bridge abutments, it is now a facing stone. Sandstone from Wallace has been used in the legislative buildings in Charlottetown (Province House) and Halifax (Province House), as well as some edifices on Parliament Hill in Ottawa.
Other local industries include: fishing, farming, and forestry.
Notable residents.
Wallace is the birthplace of Simon Newcomb, the astronomer and mathematician, and the hometown of figure skater John Mattatall as well as the retirement residence of 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics co-winner Willard Boyle co-inventor of the charge-coupled device or the CCD imaging chip at the heart of digital cameras, and Raymond Legend of the EASHL Hartford Whalers.

Dhammapala

Dhammapāla was the name of two or more great Theravada Buddhist commentators.
The earlier, born in Kanchipuram, is known to us from both the "Gandhavamsa" and the writings of Xuanzang to have lived at Badara Tittha Vihara south of modern Chennai, and to have written the commentaries on seven of the shorter canonical books (consisting almost entirely of verses) and also the commentary on the Netti, perhaps the oldest Pali work outside the canon. Extracts from the latter work, and the whole of three out of the seven others, have been published in Pali by the Pali Text Society. These works show great learning, exegetical skill and sound judgment. But as to the meaning of words, or to discussions of the ethical import of his texts, very little can be gathered from his writings of value for the social history of his time. Though in all probability a Tamil by birth, he declares, in the opening lines of those of his works that have been edited, that he followed the tradition of the Great Monastery (Maha Vihara) at Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka, and the works themselves confirm this in every respect.
Another writer, probably also called "Dhammapala", since he was supposed by the 12th century to be the same, though scholars do not accept this, wrote subcommentaries on the commentaries on the "Digha", "Majjhima" and "Samyutta Nikayas".
A third "Dhammapala" wrote "Saccasankhepa", a handbook of abhidhamma.

Novi Zrin

Novi Zrin was a fortress of family Zrinski (Zrínyi in Hungarian) built in the northernmost part of Croatia (at the border to Hungary) on the mouth of river Mura into Drava between 1661-1664.
Its purpose should have been to stop the Ottoman military forces to advance further into Croatia. The Ottomans attacked it several times from 1662 to 1664, but did not manage to conquer it. Finally, at the beginning of June 1664 a large Ottoman army, numbering up to 100.000 men, led personally by the Grand Vizier Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed Pasha, besieged it and destroyed on 7 July 1664.

The 9th Southeast Asian Games were held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from 19 November - 26 November 1977. Brunei, Indonesia, and the Philippines were finally admitted into the SEAP Games Federation in February that year. Although the word 'Peninsula' was omitted from the new federation title to reflect the expansion, its emblem (which featured six rings representing the six founding members), and the sequential numbering of the games was kept to provide continuity, as well as reverence to the objectives, aspirations and contributions of the founders. The six-ring emblem was not replaced until 1999, when the present ten-ring emblem was first used in an official games logo.

Keith Dabengwa

Keith Mbusi Dabengwa (born 17 August 1980) is a Zimbabwean cricketer.
Dabengwa is a useful all-rounder who made his First class debut for Matabeleland in 2000, taking 5 for 76, he then spent a season at the CFX Academy being named student of the year before returning to Matabeleland. He continued steadily without many spectacular performances but in 2004/05 he got selected in Zimbabwe A squad for their tours of Namibia and Bangladesh. In the first match against Bangladesh A he took 5–19 and scored 50*.
In 2005 Dabengwa scored his highest first class score of 161 against Midlands this has been his only century to date. Following this, he gained a place in the national squad and made his Test debut against New Zealand in Bulawayo taking 2 for 87 and scoring 21 runs starting his scoring with a six, a rare feat managed by only a handful of cricketers.
He played in Zimbabwe's next two Tests against India (these were Zimbabwe's last). Between those games there was a Tri Series with India and New Zealand in this Dabengwa made his ODI debut (as a super sub) against India in Harare.
Dabengwa has continued to be on the fringes of the Zimbabwe team demonstrated by his inclusion in the 2007 World Cup squad but failing to play a game. He now plays for Westerns since the revamp of domestic Zimbabwean cricket (see Logan Cup for details). 
In one Logan Cup match in 2007 he took his career best innings figures of 7 for 1. They are the best bowling figures of anyone in first class history to have taken seven wickets in an innings. The record was previously held by Fred Spofforth who took 7 for 3. However, there have been inaccuracies in the scoreboards provided by Zimbabwe Cricket and thus a question mark exists over Dadengwa's feat.
Dabengwa played for Lymington Cricket Club for the 2006 season.

L&amp;YR Class 5

The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Class 5 and Class 6 were two related classes of 2-4-2T steam locomotives.
Class 5.
The class began as a John Aspinall design of 1889. The first locomotives had 18"×26" cylinders for a tractive effort of 18,955 lb and power class 2P. Some later-built locomotives from 1893 had smaller diameter cylinders of 17" for a tractive effort of 18,360 lb. The original coal bunker capacity was of 2 tons. From 1898, some were rebuilt with increased capacity for both water and now 4 tons of coal. 270 were built in total.
In 1905, Hughes introduced a Belpaire firebox to replace the original round-topped boiler. 40 were built. From 1910, this boiler was also fitted to rebuilt locomotives.
110 eventually came into British Railways hands in 1948. By 1961, all but three had been scrapped.
Some of these locomotives were also fitted for push-pull working, being coupled to a driving trailer coach that contained a driver's cab and allowed the train to be driven in reverse, without running the locomotive around the train at the terminus.
Druitt Halpin experiments.
One locomotive, 632, was built by Hoy in 1902 with an experimental Druitt Halpin thermal storage apparatus. Similar in some respects to a Flaman boiler, this resembled a second short boiler drum atop the normal drum, in place of the dome. Other locomotives: 1015, 1164, 1315, 1335 & 1375 were similarly fitted in 1905. Ivatt also experimented with a similar device on a GNR 2-4-0. Neither appears to have been successful and after problems with mud and scale build-up, Hughes had them removed.
1906 boiler explosion.
In 1906, class 5 no. 869 suffered a boiler explosion at The Oaks station, north of . The firebox crown sheet broke free of its rod stays and burst downwards, although without splitting. 57 of the 150 one inch rod stays failed, the steam escaping through the remaining holes scalding the driver, although both footplate crew survived their injuries. The cause of the accident, which was the L&YR's second major boiler explosion in five years, was put down to poor washing out of the firebox water spaces when at shed. Afterwards, 72 lb of scale was collected. Although boilers were supposed to be washed out every eight days, this quantity suggests that it was up to three weeks since this had last been done thoroughly, either through omission or by inadequate washing.
Wirral Railway.
The Wirral Railway (WR) acquired one of these locomotives from the L&YR in June 1921: no. 1041 became WR no. 6. After the Grouping of 1923, this re-joined its original stablemates as part of the newly created London, Midland and Scottish Railway. Although the L&YR locomotives were numbered in a block from No. 10621 upwards, which included the allocation of no. 10638 to the original L&YR number of the Wirral locomotive, the former Wirral locomotive stock was included in the LMS Western Division. The largest constituent of the Western Division was the LNWR, and so WR no. 6 was numbered 6762 by the LMS, at the end of a block starting at 6515 which was allocated to former LNWR 2-4-2T locomotives; this locomotive followed on from nos. 6758–61, four former LNWR 2-4-2T which the WR had acquired from the LNWR.
No. 6762 survived into British Railways ownership (as 46762) and worked as station pilot at Preston, until being withdrawn and scrapped in 1952. It was the only Wirral Railway engine to last until Nationalisation; it also retained the original round-topped boiler throughout.
Preservation.
The first of the class, No. 1008 is preserved as a static exhibit in the National Railway Museum.
Class 6.
The L&YR Class 6 was a superheated development by George Hughes of the Aspinall L&YR Class 5.
Some were rebuilt as conversions and others built new. 20 new locomotives were built in 1911. Of the conversions, 26 were of the Aspinall engines, 18 of Hughes' own version with Belpaire firebox.
The locomotives passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923. LMS numbers were 10900-10954, except for 9 which were converted after the grouping without being renumbered. Fourteen of the class came into British Railways hands in 1948 and were numbered in the range 50835-50953.
All had been scrapped by 1952.

Afmadow () is a city in southern Somalia, located in the middle of the Juba region and bordered by Kenya, Badhadhe, Kismayo, Jamame, Jilib, Hagar, Bardhere and Elwaq in Somalia, 401 km southwest of the capital Mogadishu. It is home to a wide variety of wild animals, including the Big Five game. The vegetation in Afmadow consists of rich grassland, bounded by semi-desert. Afmadow is mainly inhabited by the Mohamed Zubeyr.
History.
The town was captured in 2006 by the Islamic Court Union as were the other districts in the region during the civil war.
On 21 November 2009, the Islamist Al-Shabab militia took control of Afmadow, causing hundreds of families and also western aid workers to flee in fear of violence, after another Islamist group, Hizbul Islam, left a day earlier, allowing Al-Shabab to move in without much resistance.
Tension had been building between both militia since the former allies fell out in October in Kismayo, leading to fighting and Al-Shabab taking Kismayo in October 2009.
On 18 October 2011, eyewitnesses reported that Kenyan jets were conducting low flight manoeuvres over the city and al-Shabab was preparing entrenchment systems to defend against an expected attack by Kenyan forces in a coordinated incursion with the Somalian army.
On 31 May 2012, it was reported that African Union (Kenyan forces) and Somali government troops captured the city, as al-Shabab abandoned the town without fighting.

Flatfoot 56

Flatfoot 56 are an American Celtic punk band from Chicago, Illinois, that formed in 2000. The group's use of Scottish Highland bagpipes has led to their classification as a Celtic punk band, comparable to Dropkick Murphys or Flogging Molly.
History.
The band formed in summer 2000 as a three-piece punk band. The three original members, who are brothers (Tobin Bawinkel, Justin Bawinkel, and Kyle Bawinkel), started writing songs in Fall 2000. By the Christmas season of the same year, they were playing their first concert. In January 2001, the band added Josh Robieson (bagpipes, guitar, mandolin) to the lineup and the band began including the Highland bagpipes and a second guitar into its sound.
In 2001 they recorded their first demo, then in Summer 2002, the band recorded their first full length album, entitled "Rumble of 56". This recording was done in Rockford, Illinois, in a studio called the Noise Chamber. Their second album, "Waves of War", was released in 2003. Their song, "That's OK," had heavy radio play on stations across the Midwestern United States. It has been known as one of the higher-rated songs Flatfoot 56 has ever played and is a crowd favorite at live performances.
In 2004, Flatfoot 56 performed at the Cornerstone Festival in Illinois for a crowd of about 700 people. It was at this concert that the band released their third album, "Knuckles Up". It has been the band's best-selling record, and the group continues to record and tour. The band has been signed to Flicker Records and has re-released "Knuckles Up" through the label. Their fourth record, "Jungle of the Midwest Sea", was released on May 15, 2007.
After the release of their fourth album, the band embarked on tours. They also appeared in festivals like Skanksgiving '08, Sonshine Festival 2008 and 2009, and the Warped Tour. They are also set to appear at the Sonshine Festival 2011 They also appeared in the Warped Tour 2010 Tour Compilation album, and recorded a song for the Swingin Utters tribute album titled "".
In January 2009, the band announced on their website that they were recording a new, full-length album. On December 18 of the same year, it was officially announced that they had signed to California based Old Shoe Records for the release of their new album "Black Thorn". The album was initially due for release St. Patricks Day (March 17) 2010, but was delayed until March 30, 2010. Upon its release, the album debuted at No. 2 on Billboard Heatseekers New Artist Chart. The first-week sales have also pushed the album into the Billboard Top 200 at No. 160, as well as other Billboard charts. 
Playing a positive-natured brand of hardcore-tinged Celtic punk, Flatfoot 56 has been unleashing itself upon America and the rest of the world. The Chicago natives achieved nationwide attention with their first two label-backed records, 2006’s "Knuckles Up" and 2007’s "Jungle of the Midwest Sea." These releases built on a heavy dose of previously established regional notoriety, helping the band gain steam early on.While each record received its fair share of acclaim, the quintet exploded onto a new level with 2010’s "Black Thorn." Landing the band on a total of nine different Billboard Charts, Flatfoot 56 proved it could consistently reach an expanding audience while treading in a genre not often associated with widespread success. 
Old Shoe Records released a compilation called WELCOME TO THE FAMILY VOL.4 - A FREE PUNK COMPILATION CD that featured the Flatfoot 56 song "Born for This". 
The video for their 2010 single "Courage" was nominated for a 2010 Chicago/Midwest Emmy Award for 'Best Director.'
In 2010 the Flatfoot 56 songs "Shiny Eyes," "Son of Shame," and "We Grow Stronger" were featured in episodes 7, 8 and 9 of season 3 of the TV series "Sons of Anarchy".
While not touring and playing with Flatfoot 56, Kyle Bawinkel sings for the hardcore side project Sexually Frustrated.
Flatfoot 56 also performed two tracks for WWE: Johnny Curtis's theme, "I Told You So" as well as a version of Irish-born WWE superstar Sheamus's theme, "Written In My Face."
Paper+Plastic Records announced in October of 2011 that they would back the band's next full length recording. The band will enter Matt Allison’s Chicago-based Atlas Studios in January to record its first release for Paper + Plastick Records. “We have always respected Paper + Plastick’s independent approach to putting out records because they always seem to promote the creative side of the album,” Bawinkel said. “As a band we all really value that creative vision, and Paper + Plastick is the place to be for that.” Like "Black Thorn," Flatfoot 56’s Paper + Plastick debut will be produced by the Street Dogs’ Johnny Rioux. “We decided that since the last experience with Johnny was so beneficial, we wanted to repeat it,” Bawinkel said. “We have been friends with Johnny for years our mutual respect fosters a good creative environment for putting together a record. He knows how to challenge us and push us the next level, which is what any band hopes for.” While the record is set to be more rootsy and folk-oriented, it promises to pack the same relentless, knock-down punch that fans have grown to expect from Flatfoot 56. More than a decade into its career, Flatfoot 56 isn’t slowing down, but maintaining a blistering pace of touring and musical output. “The next record’s sound is taking on a much more mature, heartfelt tone,” Bawinkel said. “We’re writing these songs as life gets thrown at us, and as we all get a bit older and start to interpret life in different ways, we want to express ourselves to reflect the victories and defeats that we all go through. We still love whipping the crowd into a frenzy and making everybody dance but we want to write some tunes that people can relate to, and that they can sing along to.” 
In January of 2012, Flatfoot 56 announced the finish of the recording stage of its still-untitled new album. The Celtic punk group recorded with Johnny Rioux (of Street Dogs, Social Distortion and Bruisers fame). Flatfoot 56’s new record is slated for a summer release on Paper + Plastick Records. The album is now in its mixing stages while Flatfoot is on a month-long tour in Europe and Russia. Despite not hitting the studio for over a year, Flatfoot 56 kept busy in 2011 – playing over 220 live shows in nine countries. 
Black Thorn was mention by Spin Magazine in Gavin McInnes' March 2012 List of 7 Life Changing Records. 
On July 30, 2012, the fourth label backed full length recording Toil was released. Alternative Press Magazine gave the record a favorable score and AbsolutePunk.net heaped praise on the band: “It’s not every day you come across a Christian group that’s unabashedly liberal politically. On Toil, it’s much less a gimmick and much more a reflection of the band’s genuity – their working class roots and the ability they have to combine faith, culture and song to stand up for them. That, to me, deserves a respect that runs deeper than the freshness, or lack thereof, of a melody.”

The 11th Southeast Asian Games were held in Manila, Philippines from December 6, 1981 to December 15, 1981. This was the first time that the Philippines hosted the Games since its first participation in 1977. The event was officially opened by President Ferdinand Marcos and the cauldron was lit by Benjamin Silva-Netto. The colorful opening ceremony was held in the Rizal Memorial Stadium in Manila. A new football stadium and indoor arena was built in Pasig named the University of Life Track & Field and Arena or the ULTRA, now called the PhilSports Arena. The adjacent apartments were used as the athlete's quarters and was converted into a "BLISS" housing project of First Lady Imelda Marcos.

Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers

The Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers (also Basilika Vierzehnheiligen) is a church located near the town of Bad Staffelstein near Bamberg, in Bavaria, southern Germany. The late Baroque-Rococo basilica, designed by Balthasar Neumann, was constructed between 1743 and 1772. It is dedicated to the Fourteen Holy Helpers, a group of saints venerated together in the Catholic Church, especially in Germany at the time of the Black Death.
The Basilica faces the important German river Main in Franconia. It sits on a hillside, and on the hillside opposite is Schloss Banz, a former baroque monastery. Together they are known as the "Goldene Pforte" or golden portal, an entryway to the historic Franconian cities Coburg, Kronach, Kulmbach and Bayreuth.
Legend.
On 24 September 1445, Hermann Leicht, the young shepherd of a nearby Franciscan monastery, saw a crying child in a field that belonged to the nearby Cistercian monastery of Langheim. As he bent down to pick up the child, it abruptly disappeared. A short time later, the child reappeared in the same spot. This time, two candles were burning next to it. In June 1446, the Leicht saw the child a third time. This time, the child bore a red cross on its chest and was accompanied by thirteen other children. The child said: "We are the fourteen helpers and wish to erect a chapel here, where we can rest. If you will be our servant, we will be yours!" Shortly after, Leicht saw two burning candles descending to this spot. It is alleged that miraculous healings soon began, through the intervention of the fourteen saints.
The Cistercian brothers to whom the land belonged erected a chapel, which immediately attracted pilgrims. An altar was consecrated as early as 1448. Pilgrimages to the Vierzehnheiligen continue to the present day between May and October.
The mercy altar of the Vierzehnheiligen.
The fourteen saints represented in the altar are:
The high altar of the Vierzehnheiligen.
The central scene of the unobstructed and towering high altar is a lager-than-life painting showing the Assumption of Maria. The statues depict Josef, Joachim, David and Zacharias. The lovely and imaginative pulpit is worth seeing too: free floating white putti bear the pulpit ornated with the golden reliefs of the Evangelists surrounded by shellwork. The pulpit cover (called "sound prevention cover" in German) is made of rays in a spherical shape.

Graeme Cremer

Alexander Graeme Cremer (born 19 September 1986) is a Zimbabwean cricketer. He is a leg-spinner who got into the Zimbabwe side at the age of eighteen, following the exits of Paul Strang, Andy Whittall and Ray Price from the Zimbabwean team.
Educated at the prestigious Prince Edward School, Cremer was quite prolific in school cricket, taking many wickets. He made his Test debut against Bangladesh in Dhaka on 6 January 2005, a match that Zimbabwe went on to lose handing the Bangladeshi Tigers their first ever Test match victory.
Cremer then played Tests against South Africa and New Zealand. Unfortunately Cremer, seen by many as a Test specialist, had his opportunities limited thereafter due to Zimbabwe's self-imposed exile from Test cricket. After several years on the fringes of the national team Cremer finally broke into the limited overs squad against the West Indies in late 2007. However, Zimbabwe's strong spin attack of Ray Price and Prosper Utseya meant he did not get any game time. It wasn't until the Al Barakah Cup Twenty20 tournament in Canada that Cremer was finally given a chance in the shorter format, and he made the most of it by taking 2/10 from his 3 overs.
He continued to be part of the squad in the subsequent series against Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, often named 12th man. His ODI debut came in January 2009 against Kenya, and his first ODI series was outstanding. He finished the tournament as the leading wicket taker, with 15 wickets from 5 matches at an average of 11.46.
Cremer has also developed into a bowling all-rounder. His highest First Class score is an unbeaten 171 in the 2006–07 Logan Cup, while his First Class and List A averages are in the 20s.
When Zimbabwe returned to Test cricket in 2011, Cremer missed the one-off Tests against Bangladesh, Pakistan and New Zealand due to injury. He was called up for his return to Test cricket, over six years since his last Test, for the one-off Test against New Zealand in January 2012.

Anne Chapman

Anne MacKaye Chapman (c. 1922 – June 12, 2010) was a Franco-American ethnologist. She studied the Mesoamerican civilizations and especially the Tolupan (Jicaque) people of Honduras. She had visited Magallanes and Tierra del Fuego many times since 1965 to study the Fuegian peoples in depth, especially the Selk’nam and Yahgan.
Concerning the Fuegian, she first became interested in the matter through Joseph and Annette Emperaire. Her research was essential to understand the cultures of these peoples and she met the last members of the Selk’nam people: Lola Kiepja and Ángela Loij.
Chapman wrote on many important anthropologic issues; possibly her most important work concerning the Fuegian was "Drama and Power in a Hunting Society: The Selk’nam of Tierra del Fuego" (1981). She also wrote "La Isla de los Estados en la prehistoria: Primeros datos arqueológicos" (1987, Buenos Aires), "El Fin de Un Mundo: Los Selk'nam de Tierra del Fuego'" (1990, Buenos Aires), and three chapters listed in "Cap Horn 1882-1883: Rencontre avec les Indiens Yahgan" (1995, Paris), which contains many photographs taken by members of the French expedition to Cape Horn 1882-83 that are among the best of the Yahgans, ten of the Alakaluf in 1881 of the eleven who were kidnapped and taken to Paris and other European cities, and six of the last Yahgans she took in 1964 and 1987.
Later she wrote "Hain: Selknam Initiation Ceremony" and "End of a World: The Selknam of Tierra del Fuego", both books includding a CD of Lola Kiepja's Hain chants (2003, Santiago de Chile). In 2004 she published "El fenómeno de la canoa yagán" (Universidad Marítima de Chile, Viña del Mar) and in 2006 both "Darwin in Tierra del Fuego" (Buenos Aires) and "Lom: amor y venganza, mitos de los yámana" (Santiago de Chile). 
Her last book is entitled "European Encounters with the Yamana People of Cape Horn, Before and After Darwin" (2010, New York, Cambridge University Press), a narrative of the dramas played out from 1578 to 2000 in the Cape Horn area of Chile by the native people, the navigators, the missionaries and other Europeans.
She also made films about the lives of the last members of the Selk’nam and Yahgan tribes, including "The Onas: Life and Death in Tierra del Fuego" (1977, in collaboration with Ana Montes de González) and "Homage to the Yahgans: The Last Indians of Tierra del Fuego and Cape Horn" (1990), which was a finalist in the International Film and TV Festival of New York.

Régine Crespin

Régine Crespin (23 February 19275 July 2007) was a French singer who had a major international career in opera and on the concert stage between 1950 and 1989. She started her career singing roles in the dramatic soprano and spinto soprano repertoire, drawing particular acclaim singing Wagner and Strauss heroines. She went on to sing a wider repertoire that embraced Italian, French, German, Russian, and English opera from a variety of musical periods. In the early 1970s Crespin began experiencing vocal difficulties for the first time and ultimately began performing roles from the mezzo-soprano repertoire. Throughout her career she was widely admired for the elegance, warmth and subtlety of her singing, especially in the French and German operatic repertories.
Crespin began her career in France, earning her first critical successes in the French provinces during the early 1950s and then becoming a fixture at the Opéra National de Paris in the mid-1950s. Her international career was launched in 1958 with a critically acclaimed performance of Kundry in Richard Wagner's "Parsifal" at the Bayreuth Festival. She soon appeared at most of the major opera houses in the United States and Europe and made a number of appearances in South America as well. She had a long and fruitful association with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, making over 125 appearances at that house between 1962 and 1987. Crespin retired from the stage in 1989, after which she taught singing for many years at her alma mater, the Conservatoire de Paris, and gave numerous acclaimed master classes at conservatories and universities internationally.
In recognition of Crespin's artistry as a singer, the Marguerite Long-Jacques Thibaud Competition, which had been restricted to pianists and violinists, was expanded in 2011 to include singers, and renamed the Long-Thibaud-Crespin Competition.
Early life and education: 1927–1950.
Crespin was born in Marseille in 1927. She moved to Nîmes with her family at the age of five and her parents opened a large shoe store in that city which they ran for many years. Crespin's childhood was not an easy one, being affected both by growing up during World War II and her mother's alcoholism. She initially intended to be a pharmacist but was prevented in pursuing this path after failing to pass her "Baccalauréat" at the age of 16. Up to this point her father had not allowed her to study singing. However, as her career path was limited by the exam results he finally allowed her to start taking lessons for purely pragmatic reasons. She went on to win first prize in a singing competition a few years later, and, at the age of nineteen, she went to Paris to study at the Conservatoire de Paris in the classes of Suzanne Cesbon-Viseur and Georges Jouatte. Four years later, in 1950, she was awarded first prize in the school's onstage competitions for opera and opéra comique and second prize in the school's singing competition. Traditionally past winners of Conservatoire's competitions were offered performance contracts with the Opéra National de Paris, but Crespin was for some unknown reason not offered one. This created a somewhat tenuous relationship between Crespin and her country's musical establishment which extended into the early portion of her career.
Early career in France: 1950–1957.
Her first professional stage engagement was in Reims in 1949 (Charlotte in "Werther"). Crespin was then engaged by the Opéra national du Rhin to portray Elsa in Richard Wagner's "Lohengrin" — sung in French — at Mulhouse in 1950. Received with positive reviews, Crespin was finally approached by the Paris Opéra with a contract. She accepted and made her debut there in 1951 singing Elsa. On 27 June 1951 she made her debut at the Opéra-Comique singing the title role in Giacomo Puccini's "Tosca", later singing Santuzza in "Cavalleria rusticana". However, her reception in Paris was somewhat cool and did not improve, despite performing a number of roles in that city from 1951-1952.
Crespin decided to leave Paris in 1952 and try her luck performing with opera houses in the provinces of France. There she found her first critical successes, particularly in the roles of the Marschallin in Richard Strauss's "Der Rosenkavalier" and Tosca, both sung in French. In 1955 she returned to the Paris Opéra as Rezia in Carl Maria von Weber's "Oberon". This time enthusiastically received by Paris audiences, Crespin went on to sing several triumphant performances at that house over the next three years in Desdemona in Giuseppe Verdi's "Otello", Amelia in Verdi's "Un ballo in maschera", Brunehild in "Sigurd" and Lidoine in the 1957 Paris premiere of Francis Poulenc's "Dialogues of the Carmelites" among others. She also continued to remain active in opera houses throughout France, notably singing in the world premiere of Henri Tomasi's "Sampiero Corso" at the Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux in 1956.
Rise to international success: 1958–1962.
Crespin's international career began when she was chosen by Wieland Wagner to portray the role of Kundry in Wagner's "Parsifal" at the 1958 Bayreuth Festival, despite the fact that she had never sung Wagner in German. To learn the role in German, she was coached by Lou Bruder, a professor of German literature who later became her husband. When Crespin first auditioned for Wieland she had initially assumed that he would cast her in what the French call "les wagnériennes blondes", roles like Elsa, Eva, Sieglinde, and Elisabeth. She was therefore surprised when she was asked to tackle Kundry. Crespin recalls that when she expressed her surprise to Wieland he dismissed the other roles, saying, "Oh, those dummies, I don't like them. Look, you are not born for that, you have a better job to do." Crespin essayed the task and her performance was so well liked that she was invited to sing Kundry again for the 1959 and 1960 Bayreuth Festivals. She returned to the Bayreuth Festival again in 1961 to sing Sieglinde in Wagner's "Die Walküre" and the third norn in Wagner's "Götterdämmerung".
Crespin's performances of Kundry effectively launched her international opera career, and she was soon invited to perform on the stages of the world's great opera houses. In 1959 she made her debut at La Scala singing the title role in Ildebrando Pizzetti's "Fedra". That same year she made her first appearances at the Vienna State Opera singing Sieglinde in "Die Walküre" and the Marschallin in "Der Rosenkavalier". She sang the Marschallin again for the 1959 Glyndebourne Festival and for her debut at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden in 1960, bringing "Gallic finesse, complemented by an ideal sense of proportion, supported by perfect German… she never succumbed to exaggeration, physical or vocal, never seemed fussy, never confused sadness with tragedy". She returned to Covent Garden numerous times over the next four years singing such roles as Elsa in "Lohengrin" and Tosca. In 1961 she sang for the first time at the Deutsche Oper Berlin. She sang Tosca for her United States debut at the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1962 with Giuseppe Zampieri as Cavaradossi and Tito Gobbi as Scarpia. She returned to Chicago numerous times, singing such roles as Amelia (1963), Leonore in Beethoven's "Fidelio" (1963), Elisabeth in Wagner's "Tannhäuser" (1963), and the title role in Strauss's "Ariadne auf Naxos" (1964). In 1966, Crespin performed in Boston for the Peabody Mason Concert series.
International acclaim: 1962–1989.
In 1962 Crespin joined the roster of principal sopranos at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City where she sang every year — with the exception of 1974 — through 1981. Her first performance at the house was on November 19, 1962 singing the Marschallin with Hertha Töpper as Octavian, Otto Edelmann as Baron Ochs, Anneliese Rothenberger as Sophie, and Lorin Maazel conducting. Among the many roles she created at the Met over the next two decades included Amelia, the title role in "Carmen", Charlotte in "Werther", Elsa, Giulietta in "Les Contes d'Hoffmann" Kundry, Santuzza in "Cavalleria rusticana", Senta in "Der Fliegende Holländer", Sieglinde, and Tosca among others. After leaving the Met in 1981, Crespin returned to the house twice more during her career: once to perform for the Met's 100th Anniversary Gala in 1983 and a final appearance in April 1987 as Madame de Croissy in "Dialogues des Carmélites". All told Crespin appeared in 129 performances at the Metropolitan Opera during her career, performing with many great singers like Lucine Amara, Gabriel Bacquier, Kathleen Battle, Carlo Bergonzi, Walter Cassel, Franco Corelli, Nicolai Gedda, Enrico Di Giuseppe, Plácido Domingo, Reri Grist, Alfredo Kraus, Evelyn Lear, William Lewis, George London, Christa Ludwig, Cornell MacNeil, James McCracken, Sherrill Milnes, Birgit Nilsson, Jessye Norman, Nell Rankin, Leonie Rysanek, Jeanette Scovotti, Shirley Verrett, and Jon Vickers among many others.
In 1970, after almost twenty years of faultless reviews, Crespin began experiencing some vocal challenges which caused her to re-evaluate her career. This coincided with the end of her marriage to Lou Bruder to whom she had been married to for eleven years; the couple had no children. She also had illnesses and personal issues, all of which brought her to contemplate suicide.
With Charlotte in "Werther" in 1974, Crespin began performing opera roles from the mezzo-soprano repertoire to adjust to the change in her voice. However the timbre of her voice had not altered much from her earlier singing years and she therefore brought a different sound to the roles from that of the typical mezzo-soprano. Regardless, she was well received in her new choice of repertoire. This period also led to her interest in Offenbach and her sophisticated wit found its place in recordings of Métella, the Grand Duchess of Gérolstein and Périchole, along with Dulcinée (Massenet's "Don Quichotte").
During her years at the Metropolitan Opera, Crespin remained active on the international opera stage. In 1962 she made the first of many appearances at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires singing the title role in Gluck's "Iphigénie en Tauride". Her last role at that house was Madame Flora (Baba) in "The Medium" in 1987. She appeared as Tosca in Geneva in 1962. In 1966 she sang Ariadne at the Aix-en-Provence Festival and that same year made her first appearance at the San Francisco Opera singing both Cassandre and Didon in Berlioz's "Les Troyens". She returned to the San Francisco Opera numerous times, singing such roles as Elisabeth in "Tannhäuser" (1966), the Marschallin (1967), Sieglinde (1968), Tosca (1970), Santuzza (1976), Mme de Croissy (1982), the title role in Offenbach's "La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein" (1983), Madame Flora (1986), and the Countess in Tchaikovsky's "The Queen of Spades" (1987). In 1963 she made her debut with the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company portraying Sieglinde, a role which she repeated there in 1965. She later sang with the Opera Company of Philadelphia as Carmen (1978), the Countess (1983), and Madame Flora (1986). In 1967 Crespin portrayed Brünnhilde in Wagner's "Die Walküre" for her first appearance at the Salzburg Festival. She also returned to the Opéra National de Paris a handful of times during her career, notably singing the title role in Fauré's "Pénélope". Her last opera performance was at the Paris Opéra in 1989 singing the Countess in "The Queen of Spades".
Crespin sang in many concert halls around the world, where her repertoire included Marguerite in "La Damnation de Faust", and "Les nuits d'été" by Berlioz. In recital, along with lieder (Schumann, Schubert, Brahms) she excelled in the French mélodie repertoire, especially Debussy and Poulenc, where the savouring of words and ability to capture the mood of songs made her a memorable interpreter.
Later life: 1990–2007.
After retiring from singing in 1989, Crespin focused mainly on teaching. She had joined the faculty at the Conservatoire de Paris in 1974 and continued to teach there until 1995. She had also begun teaching at the San Francisco Opera's Merola Opera Program during the latter part of her career, and was involved with that program for more than twenty years. Crespin also frequently traveled to give master classes at Universities and music conservatories in Europe and the United States during her retirement years. She continued to teach until her death from liver cancer in Paris in 2007. She had previously overcome battles with cancer in 1978 and 1984.
Her memoirs, "La vie et l'amour d'une femme" (the French name for Schumann's song cycle "Frauenliebe und -leben"), are quite candid, providing much detail of the singer's private life as well as unusual insights into her professional world. It was first published in French in 1982 and was republished in an expanded English version called "On Stage, Off Stage: A Memoire" in 1997.
Crespin was appointed Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur in 1972, and later made an Officer in 1982 and a Commander in 1994.
Recordings.
In her autobiography Crespin analyses the difficulties she found in the recording process, and notes that the Decca engineers called her, affectionately, ‘the French cannon’ due to the size of her voice.
Crespin left a considerable discography, starting, in the early part of her career, with recital discs for Vega, Pathé and Decca. Her classic recording of Berlioz's "Les nuits d'été" and Ravel's "Shéhérazade" with Ernest Ansermet and the Suisse Romande Orchestra is regarded by many as the finest of all versions on disc. Among her other important recordings were Sieglinde in "Die Walküre", and the Marschallin in "Der Rosenkavalier", both for Decca with the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by Sir Georg Solti. She also assumed the role of Brünnhilde on Herbert von Karajan's recording of "Die Walküre" with the Berlin Philharmonic re-released by Deutsche Grammophon as part of its "The Originals" series.

<doc id="2878377" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2878377" title="Breast bondage">
Breast bondage

Breast bondage is a bondage technique which involves the tying of rope around a woman's breasts in a visually intricate and decorative pattern. Breast bondage most commonly uses rope, but webbing, straps or a harness may also be used. A karada (Japanese for "body") is a rope dress or a rope body harness used in Japanese bondage and other BDSM activities.
Breast bondage often focuses on the decorative, aesthetic and erotic aspects of the result, and not on immobilization of the female subject. However, breast bondage can be combined with other techniques which restrict the subject's mobility and can provide securing points for other bondage plays, such as crotch rope and tit torture.
Technique.
Breast bondage can be applied over clothing or directly to the skin, and can be worn under clothing or in full view. 1/4 inch rope, ribbon, or leather straps can be used. 
The basic breast bondage technique involves tying ropes around the base of the breasts, causing them to bulge outwards. Usually, the same rope is used for both breasts so that the rope harness is automatically held together at the front. The rope may then also be fixed behind the back, to make a sort of bra. For this to work, the tied person needs large breasts.
Another technique is to put a rope around the torso just above the breasts, and another one just below them, then push the ropes together to squeeze the breasts from the top and bottom, as shown at left. This can be done instead of, or as well as, the other method. A rope can also be passed over the shoulders and between the breasts, drawing the rope above and below the breasts together, then pass back over the shoulders to the knots at the back. The primary rope can be used to place cinches between the arms and the body.
Shinju.
"Shinju" (from the Japanese 真珠 meaning pearl) is a euphemism to refer to the binding of female breasts. It has been popularly claimed that "shinju" is an authentic Japanese term for a "bikini harness". However, no such tie called a "shinju" is found in historic or present kinbaku.
The basic or foundational kinbaku form of binding the arms and breasts is known as the Ushiro Takatekote; which is to bind the arms behind (ushiro) the back in a box arm position (takate kote). This basic box arm tie originally found in the samurai martial art of hojōjutsu (捕縄術) or Nawajutsu, (縄術) evolved into its erotic usage at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century, and is foundational to most other kinbaku ties.
Combination with other techniques.
Sometimes, breast bondage is combined with other bondage techniques. For example, the woman's arms can be tied behind her back, in an elbow or box tie or in a reverse prayer position. When combined with breast bondage, bound arms force the woman's chest and breasts to protrude further. When combining breast and arm bondage, the ropes can draw the ropes above and below the breasts together at the sides of the breasts as they pass under the shoulders and behind the neck, thus resulting in rope effectively surrounding the breasts.
When fully bound, other BDSM tools such as nipple clamps can be used. Breast bondage can play an integral part in suspension bondage. If the subject is being suspended, particularly in a horizontal position such as a suspended hogtie, breast bondage is used as the main supporting area under the chest.

Care (band)

Care were a new wave band formed by Paul Simpson and Ian Broudie in 1983 in Liverpool, England. Care was created after the split of The Wild Swans when singer Paul Simpson (also ex-keyboardist for the Teardrop Explodes) came together with guitarist Ian Broudie (previously of Big in Japan and Original Mirrors). The first single was released in June 1983. 
History.
Paul Simpson is the vocalist of The Wild Swans, whose songs include the 1981 single "The Revolutionary Spirit". Simpson has said that the Care single "Whatever Possessed You" was originally written by him as a Wild Swans song. An album was recorded but has never been released. The singles "Whatever Possessed You", "Flaming Sword" (a top 50 single in the United Kingdom in 1983) and "My Boyish Days" were released by Camden in 1997 on a compilation album entitled "Diamonds and Emeralds", which also included the duo's B-sides, unfinished demos and tracks intended for "Love Crowns and Crucifies".
According to Allmusic, Care developed a cult following in Japan and the Philippines (where Care's songs were more popular than they were in their native England), which kept the group's memory alive.
The band broke up in 1985 after the departure of Simpson.
Post-Care.
Upon leaving Care, Simpson re-formed The Wild Swans and released two albums "Bringing Home the Ashes" (1988, Sire) and "Space Flower" in 1989. "Space Flower" reunited Broudie and Simpson, with Broudie producing the album and playing guitar. Simpson performed under the moniker Skyray from 1996 to 2006; he re-formed The Wild Swans in 2008 to critical acclaim.
Ian Broudie went on to form The Lightning Seeds in the late 1980s, releasing a string of albums which spawned hit singles like "Pure", "Change", "Sugarcoated Iceberg", "Life of Riley", and "You Showed Me". Now solo, Broudie released his first album, "Tales Told", in 2004.

Fixin' to Die Blues

"Fixin’ to Die" is blues song by American blues musician Bukka White. It is performed in the Delta blues style with White's vocal and guitar accompanied by washboard rhythm. White recorded it in Chicago on May 8, 1940 for record producer Lester Melrose. The song was written just days before, along with eleven others, at Melrose's urging. 
White was resuming his recording career, which had been interrupted by his incarceration for two and one-half years at the infamous Parchman Farm prison in Mississippi. While there, White witnessed the death of a friend and "got to wondering how a man feels when he dies". His lyrics reflect his thoughts about his children and wife:
White provides the vocal and acoustic slide guitar (which was borrowed from Big Bill Broonzy) with backing by Washboard Sam. Despite the somber lyrics, "the music throbs with a restless energy" with White's "bottleneck guitar crying in urgent counterpoint to his imagery". Music historian Ted Gioia notes that these recordings of White "come as close to art song as traditional blues has ever dared to go, but without losing any of the essential qualities of the Delta heritage". However, as with his other songs from the session, "Fixin' to Die Blues" did not capture the record buying public's interest. As a result, White largely retired from performing music, until a resurgence of interest in the early 1960s and the American folk music revival.
In 1962, folksinger Bob Dylan recorded "Fixin' to Die" for his debut album. The album liner notes indicate that it "was learned from an old recording by Bukka White". However, Dylan's arrangement uses a different melody line and some new lyrics. It is one of three blues songs on the album that deal with the theme of death. Dave Van Ronk ("Dave Van Ronk, Folksinger") and Buffy Sainte-Marie ("Many a Mile") are among Dylan's folk contemporaries who also recorded versions of the song.
Stretch recorded it for "You Can't Beat Your Brain For Entertainment" in 1976. In 2002, Robert Plant recorded a version titled "Funny In My Mind (I Believe I’m Fixin’ To Die)" for the "Dreamland" album. His former group, Led Zeppelin sometimes included it in live medleys with "Whole Lotta Love" ("Led Zeppelin BBC Sessions"). A live version by Chuck Ragan of Hot Water Music was included on "Los Feliz" in 2007. In 2010, G. Love and The Avett Brothers recorded the song as the title track of "Fixin' to Die".

Epsilon1 Arae

Epsilon1 Arae (ε1 Ara, ε1 Arae) is the Bayer designation for a star in the constellation Ara, the Altar. It is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of +4.1 Based upon an annual parallax shift of 9.04 mas, this star is around distant from the Earth.
ε1 Arae is an evolved giant star with a stellar classification of K3 III. It is around 74% more massive than the Sun. At an age of about 1.7 billion years, the outer envelope of the star has expanded to almost 34 times the Sun's radius. It is radiating energy into space at an effective temperature of 4,176 K, giving it the orange-hued glow of a K-type star.
ε1 Arae was known as (meaning: "the 1st (star) of """) in traditional Chinese astronomy. 
Allen erroneously called it as "Tso Kang" (). He probably confused constellation "Ara" with "Ari". "Tso Kang" was lain in Aries.

R&amp;R (EastEnders)

R&R in the BBC soap opera "EastEnders", located at the fictional address of 4 Turpin Road.
Over the years, the business has been know as a nightclub, with several different owners and names. It been called e20, Angie's Den, Scarlet and R&R.
The Cobra Club/The Market Cellar.
The club is opened in 1996 and named Cobra Club. It is owned by George Palmer, who employs Huw Edwards and Lenny Wallace as barmen. After the club is raided by the police in 1997, the Cobra Club closes, but is reopened later in the year and renamed The Market Cellar. The club is actually used to facilitate George's money laundering operations and illegal gambling. Later, George's daughter, Annie Palmer, takes over the running of the club and she also starts a loan shark business from inside the club with Phil Mitchell and Conor Flaherty.
e20.
The club is later given the name of e20 by Steve Owen, after he purchases the premises in 1998 from Annie. It is named after the Walford postcode, London E20. Lenny Wallace is employed as a barman and Matthew Rose is the DJ. Billy Mitchell later gets a job at the club from Steve, because Steve knew it would annoy Phil and Grant Mitchell. The opening day of e20 is 14 February 1999, Valentine's Day, and Steve's obsessive ex-girlfriend turns up and starts taunting him and then begins knocking him around until she tries to strangle him with his tie. In self-defence he hits her over the head with an ash tray, killing her. Matthew, who is a witness, is framed by Steve for Saskia's murder and sent to prison. After release, Matthew takes revenge by tying him up in the club and threatening to set it on fire, but he is only trying to scare Steve and turn him into an emotional wreck.
Steve marries Melanie Beale Ian's ex-wife in 2001, and she becomes a supposed owner of the club, though this was not correct as it was only in writing. Later, Dan Sullivan kidnaps Melanie as revenge on Steve for aiding playing apart in his imprisonment. After she is finally released from capture, she decides to torch the e20 to get back at for Steve for the lies he has told. As a result, the club needs to be completely rebuilt. Unfortunately for Steve, while his insurance claim was valid, the insurance company use a minor technicality (relating to an incident where he was fined for illegally importing duty-free wine from France in the 1980s) to invalidate his policy and avoid paying out, leaving him with no money to rebuild the club. Steve resorted to plotting a well planned armed robbery to finally raise the money to rebuild the club in late 2001. In early 2002, after Steve's criminal friends find out he conned them out of their share of the money from the robbery, Steve decides to leave for America and sell the club. He sells it to his friend Beppe di Marco, but he is £3000 short of the asking price and has to allow Billy Mitchell to become part owner, even though Billy only got 1% ownership and Beppe had 99%.
Angie's Den.
Angie's Den is named after Sharon Watts' mother, Angie Watts and apparently deceased father, Den. Initial employees are Sam Mitchell and Billy Mitchell (who still owns 1% of the club). Later Dennis Rickman works there and helps run the club with Sharon. When Den resurfaces he manages the club and his feud with the Mitchells leads to both Sam and Billy being sacked. This feud later leads to Angie's Den being burnt down, by Billy in January 2004, without realising that Vicki Fowler is inside. Billy rescues her, but after an explosion that rocks the club, it has to be closed down. Suspecting foul play, the insurance company refuse to pay out for the damage, which nearly leads to Sharon selling the remains of the club to Sam (who had coerced her cousin Billy to torch it in the first place). Den comes home from a holiday with the necessary funds and the Wattses holds onto the club. It is refurbished and Sharon reopens it. Kareena Ferreira and Lisa Fowler work there briefly as bar staff and so does Juley Smith, but he is sacked for selling drugs. When Sharon decides to flee Walford to start a new life with Dennis in 2005, she sells Angie's Den to Johnny Allen.
Scarlet.
On 14 February 2005, Johnny buys the club and names it Scarlet after his daughter who died in a fire the previous year. Initial employees include Danny Moon, Jake Moon and Billy Mitchell. In 2006, Johnny decides to leave Albert Square. Johnny's one-time fling, Amy takes over for a few months, but it proves unpopular for a young woman to be manager. Mike Swann also has a very brief spell as manager. In April 2006 after Johnny is imprisoned for murder, his young daughter Ruby is given the club. Jake Moon is given the role of manager by Johnny and Grant Mitchell runs the club with him for several months. Jake and Grant both leave, leaving Ruby and her boyfriend Sean Slater running the club. Ruby tries to employ Wayne Thompson to work as a manager but after Sean gets angry at him he is not seen again. Ruby then leaves Walford for good and the future of the club became uncertain.
R&R.
On 16 October 2007, Ronnie Mitchell reveals her plans to buy Scarlet to her sister Roxy Mitchell. Ruby Allen owns the lease of the club. Ronnie and Roxy argue over whether to call it "Roxy and Ronnie's" or "Ronnie and Roxy's", but decide on "R&R". Shortly after making an offer to Ruby, Ronnie is told that a better offer has been made and Ruby will not accept it unless she makes a better offer. This later turns out to be Jack Branning who goes into silent partnership with Ronnie. R&R opens on 29 November 2007. In August 2009 after Ronnie and Jack split up, she sells the club solely to him. Ronnie temporarily runs the club with Jack's brother Max until Jack fully recovers from being shot. In May 2010, a fire destroys the club, caused by wiring complications. It is reopened in August with Ronnie and Roxy going into partnership with Jack. In January 2011 Jack sells his share (60%) of the club to Phil Mitchell. In August 2011, to spite her cousin Phil for telling her that she is no good for the business and should sell her share of the club to him, Roxy instead sells her share (20%) to Janine Butcher, much to Phil's dislike. Off-screen, Ronnie also sells her 20% share to Janine.
When Sharon Rickman returns, she takes over the role of manager, while Joey Branning is hired as bar staff. In February 2013, Phil offers Sharon a 19% share in the club to stop her from resigning. Ronnie is in prison, and although it was never stated what happened to her share, Phil offers 19% to Sharon because it is the most he can give her without losing control to Janine, implying that Janine now owns Ronnie's 20%. When Ronnie gets out of prison, she learns that Phil has been involved in a car crash and he places her in charge of his businesses until he recovers a short while later. Roxy also starts to work at the club again, after splitting with her fiancee Alfie Moon. Carl White shows an interest in buying the club, but is later caught dealing drugs in there. In December 2013, Janine sells her 40% stake to Phil, in order to start a new life in Paris, after escaping charges of murder. The following month, Sharon decides that she wants to be a landlady again, so hands her share of the club back to Phil.

Nagai Naoyuki

, also known as or , was a Japanese samurai and Tokugawa retainer during the Bakumatsu and Meiji periods.
His great-great-grandchild was Yukio Mishima. Naoyuki's adopted son, Iwanojō Nagai, was the father of Natsu, who was Mishima's grandmother. Iwanojō's real father was Nagasumi Miyoshi (Miyoshi clan) who was a Tokugawa retainer.
Early life.
Nagai Naoyuki, or as he was first known, , was born in the Nukada district of the Okutono Domain by a concubine to . Noritada, while head of a collateral branch of the Tokugawa, was not classified as "shinpan", like the Matsudaira of Aizu, but instead as "fudai". Iwanojō, Noritada's second son, lost his father at the age of three. Subsequently, he was moved to Edo, to the Okutono domain's main residence, where he was in the care of his adoptive brother, , before being adopted by Tokugawa retainer Nagai Naonori. Following his adoption he took the adult name of Naoyuki (also read "Naomune").
Career.
After completing a thorough education in literature, art, and military training, Nagai entered the ranks of the Tokugawa bureaucracy. He served from 1851 to 1852 as an instructor at the Kitenkan, a branch of the Shogunate's Shoheizaka academy, located in the city of Kofu. Shortly after Matthew Perry's arrival, Nagai was placed in charge of casting cannons for coastal defense, and in 1855, he was transferred to the Nagasaki Naval Training Center, where he served as its director. Katsu Kaishu later credited Nagai for much of the training center's progress, as well as the construction of one of its training ships, the "Kottoru". In 1857 he went to Edo (modern-day Tokyo) on board the "Kanko Maru", Japan's first steam warship, together with 103 of his students.
In 1858, Nagai was appointed one of the first "gaikoku bugyō" (commissioner for foreign affairs). He served from August 1858 through March 1859; and he served again from November 1865 through April 1867.
Nagai was transferred yet again in 1862, this time to serve as one of the city magistrates of Kyoto. He served as Kyoto "machi-bugyō" from August 1862 through March 1864. Following this two-year stint in the capital, he was made a shogunate inspector or overseer ("ōmetsuke") from March 1864 through May 1865. He was promoted to the position of "wakadoshiyori-kaku" (aide to the junior counselors) from April 1867 through January 1868; and thereafter, he was one of the "wakadoshiyori" (junior counselor) from January to March 1868 when the Meiji Restoration signaled the end of the Tokugawa shogunate.
Tenure as Hakodate Magistrate.
Returning to Edo following the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he then joined Enomoto Takeaki and the Tokugawa navy, boarding the "Kaiten" and heading to Hokkaido by way of Matsushima, in the Sendai domain. In Hokkaido, Nagai was chosen to be one of the city magistrates of Hakodate by the new Ezo Republic. However, the Imperial Army soon began its attack on Hokkaido, and Nagai surrendered at the small fortress of Benten Daiba, along with the survivors of the Shinsengumi.
Later life.
After a period of three years in prison, he was pardoned, and again rose to positions of political prominence, serving most notably as the secretary to the "Genrō."
One of his descendants, through his adopted son Iwanojō, was the famous author Yukio Mishima.

Brunel Museum

The Brunel Museum is a museum in the Brunel Engine House, Rotherhithe, London Borough of Southwark. The Engine House was designed by Sir Marc Isambard Brunel to be part of the infrastructure of the Thames Tunnel.
Brunel Engine House.
The Engine House was designed by Sir Marc Isambard Brunel to be part of the infrastructure of the Thames Tunnel. It held steam-powered pumps used to extract water from the tunnel.
Since 1961 the building has been used as a museum displaying information on the construction of the tunnel and the other projects by Marc and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Structural decay was prevented in 1975 by a charitable trust named "Brunel Exhibition Rotherhithe". 
In 2006 the museum changed its name from Brunel Engine House to Brunel Museum and has expanded its exhibition to include a new mural on the shaft showing the tunnel shield, and other works by the Brunels, such as models of famous Brunel bridges incorporated into bench seating.
Open House Weekend.
The Brunel Museum takes part in the Open House Weekend event every year and, until the East London Line's temporary closure in 2007, took parties of people through the tunnel on the Underground trains as part of a guided tour of the tunnel.
The future.
The museum underwent major building works in 2007. This entailed removing the Rennie flat V steam engine (now to be found at Chatham Historic Dockyard) to create a larger exhibition space, a cafe and improved toilet facilities. With the closure of the East London Line in December 2007 for extensive upgrading the museum hoped that the access shaft into the tunnel (originally built to be the grand entrance hall to the tunnel) could be capped with a concrete shelf at the bottom, above the level of the trains. This shelf was completed in early 2010, with the inauguration taking place in late January. The access shaft took in its first groups from the general public on 14 February 2010 (Valentine's Day) when it was opened as the 'Tunnel of Love' for short historical presentations detailing the history of the tunnel and of some interesting historical notes from the private life and diary of Brunel's son, Isambard. 
The museum now plans to continue the fit-out of the shaft, which will house exhibition and performance space.

N-Methylmorpholine N-oxide

"N"-Methylmorpholine "N"-oxide (more correctly 4-methylmorpholine 4-oxide), NMO or NMMO is an organic compound. This heterocyclic amine oxide and morpholine derivative is used in organic chemistry as a co-oxidant and sacrificial catalyst in oxidation reactions for instance in osmium tetroxide oxidations and the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation or oxidations with TPAP. NMO is commercially supplied both as a monohydrate C5H11NO2·H2O and as the anhydrous compound. The monohydrate is used as a solvent for cellulose in the Lyocell process to produce cellulose fibers.
Uses.
Solvent of cellulose.
NMMO monohydrate is used as a solvent in the Lyocell process to produce Tencel fiber. It dissolves cellulose to form a solution called dope, and the cellulose is reprecipitated in a water bath to produce a fiber. The process is similar but not analogous to the viscose process. In the viscose process, cellulose is made soluble by conversion to its xanthate derivatives. With NMMO, cellulose is not derivatized but dissolves to give a homogeneous polymer solution. The resulting fiber is similar to viscose; this was observed, for example, for Valonia cellulose microfibrils. Dilution with water causes the cellulose to reprecipitate, i.e. the solvation of cellulose with NMMO is a water sensitive process.
Cellulose remains insoluble to most solvents since it has a strong and highly structured intermolecular hydrogen bonding network, which resists common solvents. NMMO is able to break the hydrogen bonding network that keeps cellulose insoluble to water and other solvents. Similar solubility has been obtained in a few solvents, particularly a mix of lithium chloride in dimethyl acetamide and some hydrophilic ionic liquids.
Dissolution of scleroproteins.
Another use of NMO is in the dissolution of scleroprotein (found in animal tissue). This dissolution occurs in the crystal areas which are more homogeneous and contain glycine and alanine residues with a small number of other residues. How NMO dissolves these proteins is scarcely studied. Other studies, however, have been done in similar amide systems (i.e. hexapeptide). The hydrogen bonds of the amides can be broken by NMO.
Oxidant.
NMO, as an N-oxide, is an oxidant. It is used as a stoichiometric oxidant to regenerate the main catalyst after the main catalyst has been reduced by the substrate. For example, the toxic and volatile osmium tetroxide needs to be added in stoichiometric amounts to effect dihydroxylation, but if continuously regenerated with NMO, the amount can be reduced to catalytic quantities.

Hanson is often critical of many prevailing views on the effects of alcohol on the body. He contends, for example, that the benefits of moderate drinking outweigh the harms from abusive drinking. Hanson is a critic of many groups that advocate the reduction of alcohol use; he describes these groups as “neo-prohibitionist.” 
Hanson criticizes what he calls the "temperance mentality" of many groups and claims that "their tactic is to establish cultural rather than strictly legal prohibition by making alcohol beverages less socially acceptable and marginalizing those who drink, no matter how moderately." 
A critic of the 21-year age limit on legal drinking in the United States, he has sat on the board of advisors of the National Youth Rights Association since 1998.
Hanson has published books and other publications on alcohol and maintains two websites on the subject. One is funded entirely by Hanson and the other "receives no support, directly or indirectly, from any person or entity associated with the production, distribution, advertising or sale of alcoholic beverages." His research and opinions have been reported in the New York Times and other newspapers; he has been quoted in Family Circle, Health magazine, Parade and other popular publications; and textbooks in 15 fields of study report his research.
He is a Board Member of the Saint Jude Retreats.

Lambda Arae

Lambda Arae (λ Ara, λ Arae) is the Bayer designation for a star in the southern constellation of Ara. It is at a distance of from Earth. The apparent visual magnitude of this star is 4.77, making it bright enough to be seen with the naked eye.
The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of F4 V, which places it among the category of F-type main sequence stars. It shines with 4.6 times the luminosity of the Sun. The outer atmosphere is radiating this energy at an effective temperature of 6,725 K, giving it the yellow-white hue of an F-type star. There is some evidence that this may be a binary star system consisting of two stars with identical masses.
Examination of Lambda Arae with the Spitzer Space Telescope shows an excess of infrared emission at a wavelength of 70 μm. This suggests it may be orbited by a disk of dust at a radius of more than 15 astronomical units

The Inspiration of Saint Matthew

The Inspiration of Saint Matthew (1602) is a painting by the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio. Commissioned by the French Cardinal Matteo Contarelli, the canvas hangs in Contarelli chapel altar in the church of the French congregation San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome, Italy. It is one of three Caravaggio canvases in the chapel: hanging between the larger earlier canvases of "The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew", and "The Calling of Saint Matthew". This was not an easy commission for Caravaggio, and at least two of the three paintings had to be either replaced or repainted to satisfy his patron, the Cardinal Del Monte. 
It is instructive to compare the two versions of the latter painting to see how provocative and controversial Caravaggio was in his time. Unfortunately, the first, rejected, version of this theme was destroyed in World War II, and we only have black and white and enhanced color reproductions. In the first version, "Saint Matthew and the Angel", the angel invades St. Matthew's personal space and engages in what appears more direct intervention than divine inspiration. The angel intertwines with the old man, apparently whispering inspiration into his ear. The rejected painting can be compared to the earlier Caravaggio canvas of the "Rest on the Flight into Egypt".
In the work featured on the altar, the angel belongs to an aerial and sublime dimension, enveloped in an encircling rippled sheet. The restless Matthew leans to work, as the angel enumerates for him the work to come. All is darkness but for the two large figures. Matthew appears to have rushed to his desk, his stool teetering into our space. His expression is sober.
It is thought the contemporary styles of Caravaggio and Carracci were at odds with each other, and non overlapping. In this light it is instructive to compare and contrast a similar canvas, by Carracci's pupil, Giovanni Lanfranco presently in Piacenza as well as a painting on a similar theme by Rembrandt.

<doc id="2878470" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2878470" title="Irish Hill, Louisville">
Irish Hill, Louisville

Irish Hill is a neighborhood east of downtown Louisville, Kentucky USA. It is bounded by Baxter Avenue to the west, Lexington Road to the north, the middle fork of Beargrass Creek and I-64 to the east. Cave Hill Cemetery is located directly south of Irish Hill. It is in the inner Highlands section of Louisville.
History.
Irish Hill was originally known colloquially as "Billy Goat Hill" after Whaley's goat farm. Anticipating development, the city annexed the area in 1854. Streets were laid out in 1859 by Benjamin Adams and John Hull in an area known as Adams and Hull's Addition. The rest of the community was developed five years later by Ward Payne.
Irish Hill acquired its name because it sits on a ridge above the Ohio River flood plain and was settled by Irish Catholics during the nineteenth century, although many German Catholics settled there as well. A sampling of the 1895 city directory lists the following occupations from Irish Hill occupants: huckster, carpenter, grocer, shoemaker, seamstress, railroad employee, saloon keeper, plumber and stock trader.
During the 1937 flood of Louisville, the waters never came up the hill, so the "pontoon bridge" was located along Baxter at Lexington Road to help people escape from the downtown water. Over 20,000 people passed through Irish Hill before moving onto the Highlands or Crescent Hill. The neighbors of Irish Hill provided food, water and temporary shelter to those in need and frightened during this trying time.
The Irish Hill Neighborhood Association (IHNA) formed in 1976 to address various problems with the neighborhood including abandoned houses. The Association dismantled and was once again reformed in 1996. IHNA has been going strong ever since and has successfully rid the neighborhood of a cell tower and slaughter house. The Association is currently working with a developer on the old scrap yards site located on Lexington Road to ensure that the new development will not involve rerouting Beargrass Creek.
Features.
From the 1850s until it was demolished in 1968, the City Workhouse, which housed criminals convicted of minor crimes, was located at Payne and Lexington Streets, across from what is now called Distillery Commons. Breslin Park, a site, was opened on the site of the old City Workhouse in 1974. Distillery Commons was originally the Old Kentucky Distillery which was the largest distillery in the world at its time of operation. Distillery Commons now houses several commercial office spaces, with tenants such as Kinetic thetechnologyagency. Baxter Station is located on the most northwestern boundary of the neighborhood. Another early business was the Beargrass Slaughter House, but it was primarily a residential neighborhood. Other prominent businesses at the time included: Doll Lumber, Roppel's Grocery, Stottmann's Cafe, Otte's Grocery, Leibert Farm and Seitz's Drugstore.
St. Aloysius Catholic Church and School quickly became the cornerstone of Irish Hill. The church was dedicated on May 3, 1890 to a standing room only crowd. Father Joseph A. O'Grady lead the parish. It is rumored that the "A" for the middle initial of his name stood for Aloysuis, hence the name of the church. In 1996, the Archdiocese of Louisville decide to close the school and church, even though the parishioners and neighbors strongly objected. St. Aloysius will forever remain a part of Irish Hill and the reason why many generations of families have occupied this neighborhood for over one hundred years.
Other than the Shotgun houses, there are several larger historical houses in the area, such as the Valentine Schneikert house and the Nicholas Finzer house, built around 1869 and still the largest house in the neighborhood. Other historic sites are the St. Aloysius church and the old Rogers Street fire house (opened in 1893 and closed in 1977). All of these buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places.
Breslin Park.
On May 16, 2012, Mayor Greg Fischer dedicated an array of major improvements and additions costing $500,000 at a Revitalized Breslin Park at Lexington Road and Payne Street. The recent improvements produced a total redevelopment of the corner park. Included are a new playground, a new 1,500-square-foot spray-ground, a new multi-use activity field, and a one-third mile walking path around the park, which is roughly 10 acres in size.
Demographics.
As of 2000, the population of Irish Hill was 1,456, of which 93.5% are white, 3.2% are black, 1.9% are Hispanic, & 1.7% are listed as other. College graduates are 27.3% of the population, people without a high school degree are 31.6%. Females outnumber males 51.9% to 48.1%

<doc id="2878472" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2878472" title="SoftRAM">
SoftRAM

SoftRAM and SoftRAM95 were system software products which claimed to "double" the available memory in Microsoft Windows without the need for a hardware upgrade. However, it later emerged that the program didn't even attempt to do what it claimed to do. In July 1996, the developer, Syncronys, settled charges brought by the Federal Trade Commission of "false and misleading" claims in relation to the capability of the software. The product was rated the third "Worst Tech Product of All Time" by PC World in 2006.
SoftRAM.
SoftRAM was designed for use with Windows 3.x. It was launched in May 1995 and would go on to sell more than 100,000 copies.
Most memory errors in Windows 3.x were caused by the first megabyte of memory in a PC, the conventional memory, becoming full. Windows must allocate a Program Segment Prefix (PSP) in this area of memory for each program started. Some utilities prevented DLLs from allocating memory here, leaving more space for user programs. This was a standard technique also used by other memory optimisation tools. SoftRAM also claimed to increase the amount of virtual memory available by compressing the pages of virtual memory stored in the swap file on the hard disk, which has the added effect of reducing the number of swap file reads and writes. The software also increases the size of the Windows page file, something easily achievable for free and without the use of additional software by changing system settings.
SoftRAM95.
SoftRAM95 was designed for Windows 95 and was released in August 1995. The company sold over 600,000 copies of SoftRAM95 at a list price of USD $79.95, GBP £60 or 170 DM.
When Windows 95 was launched, it was widely reported that software for the operating system would be "memory hungry", requiring at least 4 megabytes of RAM and preferably 8. Syncronys positioned SoftRAM as a cheaper alternative to buying more memory for those who would otherwise be unable to run Windows 95.
FTC investigation.
In December 1995, the German computing journal c't disassembled the program and determined that it did not even attempt to do what it was meant to do. In fact, the data passed through the VxD completely unaltered so that no compression whatsoever could have taken place. The actual drivers were in fact slightly modified versions of code examples taken from Microsoft's "Windows Development Kit". Still, the program would try to pretend that it increased system resources, by silently increasing the size of the swap file on Windows 3.1 and by giving false information on the current state of the system. Even worse, the program was compiled with the debug flag on and so runs slower than the original driver from Microsoft. A further test by PC Magazine revealed that SoftRAM took the same amount of time to move through systems that contained varying amounts of RAM; leading the magazine's technical editor to call SoftRAM completely "devoid of value". Another study by Dr. Dobb's Journal came to the same conclusions. Tests by PC World determined that the program did little more than increase the size of the hard drive cache—something that a knowledgeable user could easily do without buying additional software. Furthermore, the company used the "Designed for Windows 95" logo on the packaging when the product had not been approved by Microsoft for use with the operating system.
The Federal Trade Commission began an investigation in late 1995. It ultimately concluded that Syncronys' claims about SoftRAM were "false and misleading". It also concluded that "SoftRAM95 does not increase RAM in a computer using Windows 95; nor does the product enhance the speed, capacity, or other performance measures of a computer using Windows 95". The investigation prompted the company to recall both SoftRAM and SoftRAM95 from the market in December 1995. Several individual customers filed suit against the company as well. Syncronys settled with the FTC and the suing customers in 1996. As part of the FTC settlement, it agreed to give rebates to any customers who requested them.
Syncronys eventually filed for bankruptcy in 1999 after releasing other poorly received tools. A large number of its creditors were customers who hadn't received their rebates for SoftRAM.

Iota Arae

Iota Arae (ι Ara, ι Arae) is the Bayer designation for a star in the southern constellation of Ara. It is approximately from Earth, give or take a 70 light-year margin of error, and has an apparent visual magnitude of 5.25. Based upon the Bortle Dark-Sky Scale, this means the star is visible to the naked eye from suburban skies.
This is an evolved giant star with a stellar classification of B2 IIIne. The 'e' notation indicates the spectrum displays emission lines, which means this is a Be star that is surrounded by hot, circumstellar gas. It is spinning rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 375 km/s. The Doppler effect from this rotation is causing the absorption lines to widen and become nebulous, as indicated by the 'n' notation in the stellar class.
Iota Arae has around 8.3 times the mass of the Sun and is shining brightly with 5,740 times the Sun's luminosity. This energy is being radiated into space from the outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 21,380 K, giving it the characteristic blue-white hue of a B-type star. It is classified as a Gamma Cassiopeiae-type variable star and its brightness varies by 0.054 in magnitude.

Central High School (Duluth, Minnesota)

Duluth Central High School, also known as Central High School, was a secondary school located in Duluth, Minnesota, which educated students in grades seven through twelve. The school first opened in 1893. The mascot of the school was the Trojan. In 1971, the new Central High School building was built on top of the hill near the intersection of Central Entrance and Pecan Avenue.
Duluth Central closed at the end of the 2010–2011 school year.
History.
When originally built on the hillside in 1892, Duluth Central High School was famed not only for its grand clock tower, which could be seen for miles, but also for its wide halls, sweeping stairways with iron banisters, large chandeliers, and beautiful statuary.
Due to age and safety conditions, the Duluth School Board decided in 1970 that it would have to build a new school to replace Historic Old Central High School. In 1971, the new Central High School building was built on top of the hill. The school moved from its original building, which now currently houses administrative offices for the district.
In 2007, the Duluth School Board announced that they would support the long-range Red plan for the district which would close Duluth Central and keep a renovated Ordean Middle School (now Duluth East High School) and Duluth Denfeld High School as the only two high schools in Duluth.
2011 was the last graduating class of Duluth Central High School. The grounds and the buildings will remain empty and are currently up for sale by the school district.
In November 2013 the Duluth City Council will meet to finalize plans to rezone the land from a R-1 (residential zone) to a commercial C zone paving the way for ISD 709 to sell Central High School to potential land developers for commercial purposes.

Dharwad pedha

Dharwad pedha () is a sweet delicacy unique to the state of Karnataka, India. It derives its name from the city of Dharwad in Karnataka.This sweet's history is around 175 years old. Dharwad pedha has been accorded Geographical Indication (GI) tag. Its GI tag number is 85.
History.
Dharwad Pedha traces its historical origin to Thakur family which migrated from Unnao in Uttar Pradesh to Dharwad after the dreaded plague broke out there sometime in early 19th Century. With meagre funds, Shri. Ram Ratan Singh Thakur (first generation sweet maker) started making ‘pedhas’ and selling them and gradually, it started becoming popular.
Shri. Ram Ratan Singh Thakur’s grandson, Shri. Babu Singh Thakur, built the reputation of the ‘pedha’ with a missionary zeal. With no time, the ‘pedha’ became so popular that local people of Dharwad began identifying it by his name and as ‘Line Bazaar Pedha’ (the name of the street on which the shop is located).
The technique of preparing these ‘pedhas’ however remains a closely guarded trade secret, known only to the family members of Shri. Babusingh Thakur, as handed down the generations, by father to son.
Babusingh Thakur had only outlet to sell Pedhas, which were made in limited quantity for decades. But now few outlets are added.
Apart from this Mishra Pedha's are also popular, as these have more outlets & available through the day. Mishra has many outlets in twin cities of Dharwad & Hubli. Apart from this the cities of Bangaluru & Pune have Dharwad Pedha outlets.
Many local sweet shops sell similar pedhas as Dharwadi pedha in Pune.
Ingredients.
The ingredients include milk, sugar and thickened milk.
Preparations.
It is made of milk which is heated and stirred continuously, with added flavour and sugar.

Optical computing

Optical or photonic computing uses photons produced by lasers or diodes for computation. Photons promise to allow a higher bandwidth than the electrons used in conventional computers.
Most research projects focus on replacing current computer components with optical equivalents, resulting in an optical digital computer system processing binary data. This approach appears to offer the best short-term prospects for commercial optical computing, since optical components could be integrated into traditional computers to produce an optical-electronic hybrid. However, optoelectronic devices lose 30% of their energy converting electrons into photons and back. This also slows down transmission of messages. All-optical computers eliminate the need for optical-electrical-optical (OEO) conversions.
Application-specific devices such as "optical correlators" have been designed that use principles of optical computing. Such devices can be used for detecting and tracking objects, for example.
Optical components for binary digital computer.
The fundamental building block of modern electronic computers is the transistor. To replace electronic components with optical ones, an equivalent optical transistor is required. This is achieved using materials with a non-linear refractive index. In particular, materials exist where the intensity of incoming light affects the intensity of the light transmitted through the material in a similar manner to the voltage response of an electronic transistor. Such an "optical transistor" can be used to create optical logic gates, which in turn are assembled into the higher level components of the computer's CPU. These will be non linear crystals used to manipulate light beams into controlling others.
Controversy.
There are disagreements among researchers about the future capabilities of optical computers: will they be able to compete with semiconductor-based electronic computers on speed, power consumption, cost, and size? Opponents of the idea that optical computers can be competitive note that real-world logic systems require "logic-level restoration, cascadability, fan-out and input–output isolation", all of which are currently provided by electronic transistors at low cost, low power, and high speed. For optical logic to be competitive beyond a few niche applications, major breakthroughs in non-linear optical device technology would be required, or perhaps a change in the nature of computing itself.
Misconceptions, challenges and prospects.
A claimed advantage of optics is that it can reduce power consumption, but an optical communication system typically uses more power over short distances than an electronic one. This is because the shot noise of an optical communication channel is greater than the thermal noise of an electrical channel which, from information theory, means that more signal power is required to achieve the same data capacity. However, over longer distances and at greater data rates, the loss in electrical lines is larger than that of optical communications. As communication data rates rise, this distance becomes shorter and so the prospect of using optics in computing systems becomes more practical. 
A significant challenge to optical computing is that computation is a nonlinear process in which multiple signals must interact. Light, which is an electromagnetic wave, can only interact with another electromagnetic wave in the presence of electrons in a material, and the strength of this interaction is much weaker for electromagnetic waves such as light than for the electronic signals in a conventional computer. This results in the processing elements for an optical computer requiring more power and larger dimensions than those for a conventional electronic computer using transistors. 
Photonic logic.
Photonic logic is the use of photons (light) in logic gates (NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR). Switching is obtained using nonlinear optical effects when two or more signals are combined.
Resonators are especially useful in photonic logic, since they allow a build-up of energy from constructive interference, thus enhancing optical nonlinear effects.
Other approaches currently being investigated include photonic logic at a molecular level, using photoluminescent chemicals. In a recent demonstration, Witlicki et al. performed logical operations using molecules and SERS.

Will Lee

William "Will" Lee (August 6, 1908 – December 7, 1982) was an American actor and comedian, best known for playing Mr. Hooper, one of four original human characters on "Sesame Street", from the show's debut in 1969 until his death in 1982.
Early career.
Lee was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York and began his career as a character actor on stage. He was a member of the Group Theater in the 1930s and appeared in "Johnny Johnson", "Night Music", "Boy Meets Girl", "The Time of Your Life" (as Willie the pinball machine addict) and other Broadway plays. He succeeded John Garfield as the lead in "Golden Boy".
Lee was co-founder of the Theater of Action and a member of the Federal Theatre Project. During World War II, he served in Army Special Services in Australia and Manila and was cited twice for directing and staging shows for troops overseas, as well as teaching acting classes. After the war, he appeared Off Broadway in Norman Mailer's "Deer Park" (as movie mogul Teppis) and on Broadway in "The Shrike," "Once Upon a Mattress", "Carnival!", "Incident At Vichy" and "The World of Sholom Aleichem".
Blacklist and teaching.
Lee also began appearing in movies, including bit parts in "Casbah", "A Song Is Born", "Little Fugitive", and "Saboteur". He was blacklisted as an alleged communist and barred from movies and on TV for five years during the Red Scare, according to members of his family. He had been active in the Actor's Workshop and had been an unfriendly witness before the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings in 1950 investigating show business. At the end of that period, in 1956, he landed the role of Grandpa Hughes in "As The World Turns"; however, the role was recast with Santos Ortega on the show's second episode.
He taught at the American Theatre Wing for nine years (where one of his students included James Earl Jones), as well as at the New School for Social Research, Boston University, and the Uta Hagen-Herbert Berghof Studio. In addition, he conducted his own acting classes. Outside of "Sesame Street", later roles included TV movies and a supporting role as the judge in the 1983 movie "Daniel". Lee also worked in commercials, including a spot for Atari, as a grandfather learning to play Pac-Man from his granddaughter and spots for Ocean Spray juice.
Impact of Mr. Hooper.
In 1969, he pursued the role of Mr. Hooper on the popular children's show "Sesame Street". "He gave millions of children the message that the old and the young have a lot to say to each other," said Joan Ganz Cooney, president of the Children's Television Workshop. The New York Times reported that on "Sesame Street", Lee's Mr. Hooper ranked ahead of all live cast members in recognition by young audiences, according to a survey. His bowtie and hornrimmed reading glasses became his trademark.
In a November 1970 "TIME" article, following the show's first season, Lee recalled his feelings about the show: 
In addition to being a staple of "Sesame Street" for more than 10 years, Lee played Mr. Hooper in TV specials ("Christmas Eve on Sesame Street" and "A Special Sesame Street Christmas"), guest appearances (), stage appearances, countless record albums, and parades, including the 1982 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. It was revealed in "Christmas Eve on Sesame Street" that Mr. Hooper is Jewish, as was Lee himself. Lee taped his final segments as Mr. Hooper in November 1982, but his death would become the focal point of Episode 1839, in which Mr. Hooper's death is explained to Big Bird by the adults.
According to his obituary in "The New York Times" as he became known on "Sesame Street", children would approach him on the street and ask, "How did you get out of the television set?" or whisper, "I love you." "Apart from the joy of knowing that you are helping so many kids, the recognition is heartwarming," Lee was quoted as saying in 1981.
Death of Mr. Hooper.
Lee died in December 1982 at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City from a heart attack. His death left the producers of "Sesame Street" with questions about how to acknowledge the death of one of the series' most visible actors. After considering a number of options, CTW decided to have the character of Mr. Hooper die as well instead of getting a new actor for him, and use the episode to teach its young viewers about death as a natural part of life.
Episode 1839, now known to children and fans as "Farewell, Mr. Hooper" aired on November 24, 1983 (Thanksgiving Day), and was quickly selected by the Daytime Emmys as being one of the 10 most influential moments in daytime television. Before the show/broadcast ended they showed a live-picture of Will Lee, a date telling how long he lived and the writing "In Loving Memory of Will Lee" before fading out.
His friends who worked with him on the show were saddened by Lee's death because over the time Lee played as his signature character on TV, he befriended most of the cast of the show. The cast said their characters' sad faces were real but they went through their performance when remembering they were doing it for a good outcome. Caroll Spinney (Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch) said that the last time he saw Will Lee alive was during the taping of the last episode involving Mr. Hooper in November, 1982. Lee felt ill that day and barely spoke to the cast. Spinney (who was wearing Big Bird's feet at the time) compulsively placed his arm around Lee's shoulder and said "I love you, Mr. Looper." Lee replied, "And I love you, Caroll." Lee died a few days later.
Personal life.
Lee was never married. His sister is Sophia Lee-Lubov, who used to live in Florida.
Death.
Lee died of a heart attack at Lenox Hill Hospital on December 7, 1982 at the age of 74. He was survived by his sister Sophia Lee-Lubov.

Brent Sopel

Brent Bernard Sopel (born January 7, 1977) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman currently playing for Salavat Yulaev Ufa of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).
Playing career.
Vancouver Canucks.
On April 3, 1996, just under a year after being drafted, Sopel signed his first professional contract with his draft team, the Vancouver Canucks. Sopel scored his first NHL goal on April 10, 1999 against the Edmonton Oilers' Tommy Salo.
Sopel was traded back to the Canucks during their 2006–07 season, on February 1, 2007, the NHL trade deadline. He missed the first game of the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs against the Dallas Stars after he injured his back while picking up a cracker that was dropped by former teammate Andrew Greven. The Canucks beat the Stars in quadruple overtime, in the sixth longest game in NHL history.
New York Islanders.
On August 3, 2005, the Canucks traded Sopel to the New York Islanders for a conditional draft pick in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft. On August 16, just under a week after being traded, Sopel signed a two-year, $4.8-million dollar with the Islanders.
Chicago Blackhawks.
Heading into the 2007–08 season with no contract, Sopel was invited to the Detroit Red Wings' training camp. However, on September 28, 2007, Sopel left Red Wings camp, signing a one-year, $1.5-million contract with the Chicago Blackhawks after the Red Wings had only offered a one-year, $500,000 contract. On January 10, 2008, Sopel signed a 3-year, $7-million contract extension with the Blackhawks, keeping him in Chicago through to the 2010-11 NHL season. On June 9, 2010, Brent Sopel won the Stanley Cup with the Chicago Blackhawks.
In June 2010, Sopel brought the team's recently won Stanley Cup to the 2010 Chicago Gay Pride Parade. Sopel brought the Cup to the parade in honor of the late Brendan Burke, son of his former boss in Vancouver, Brian, to display it in the Chicago Gay Pride Parade, stating to the press that honoring Burke's legacy and his father's example of familial support and tolerance was one of his reasons for marching in the parade. Although he was the team's representative, contrary to popular belief, Sopel did not use his personal day with it in the parade.
Atlanta Thrashers.
On June 23, 2010, Sopel was traded to the Atlanta Thrashers along with Dustin Byfuglien, Ben Eager, and Akim Aliu, for the 24th (Kevin Hayes) and 54th overall picks (Justin Holl) in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft, Marty Reasoner, Joey Crabb, and Jeremy Morin.
Montreal Canadiens.
After playing 59 games for Atlanta, registering 2 goals and 7 points, he was traded to the Montreal Canadiens along with Nigel Dawes for Ben Maxwell and a 4th-round draft pick in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft on February 24, 2011.
Kontinental Hockey League.
On July 29, 2011, Sopel announced that he had signed a two-year contract with Metallurg Novokuznetsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). During the 2012–13 season, his second with Novokuznetsk, Sopel was traded to join Salavat Yulaev Ufa for their playoff campaign on January 31, 2013. In summer he signed a two-year deal with Salavat Yulaev.
Personal life.
Although born in Calgary, Sopel grew up in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in the city's Silverwood Heights neighborhood, where he attended Sister O'Brien School and Marion M. Graham Collegiate. Brent Is currently getting divorced from his wife of over 12 years, Kelly. They have 2 sons; Paul & Jake and 2 daughters; Lyla & Jayla. Lyla has been diagnosed with dyslexia and dysgraphia, like Brent. Paul was adopted in 2007, when he was 17 years old. His parents, who were family friends of the Sopels, both died in a short period of time. Brent and Kelly thought it would be best if they took care of him. Sopel's children and ex reside in Hinsdale, a suburb of Chicago.

Hurricane Wilma

Hurricane Wilma was the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Atlantic basin. Part of the record breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, which included three of the six most intense Atlantic hurricanes ever (along with #4 Rita and #6 Katrina), Wilma was the twenty-second storm, thirteenth hurricane, sixth major hurricane, fourth Category 5 hurricane, and second-most destructive hurricane of the 2005 season. A tropical depression formed in the Caribbean Sea near Jamaica on October 15, and intensified into a tropical storm two days later, which was named "Wilma". After heading westward as a tropical depression, Wilma turned abruptly southward after becoming a tropical storm. Wilma continued intensifying, and eventually became a hurricane on October 18. Shortly thereafter, extreme intensification occurred, and in only 24 hours, Wilma became a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 185 mph (295 km/h).
Intensity slowly leveled off after becoming a Category 5 hurricane, and winds had decreased to 150 mph (240 km/h) before reaching the Yucatán Peninsula on October 20 and 21. After crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, Wilma emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane. As Wilma began accelerating to the northeast, gradual re-intensification occurred, and the hurricane became a Category 3 hurricane on October 24. Shortly thereafter, Wilma made landfall in Cape Romano, Florida with winds of 120 mph (190 km/h). As Wilma was crossing Florida, it had briefly weakened back to a Category 2 hurricane, but again re-intensified as it reached the Atlantic Ocean. The hurricane intensified into a Category 3 hurricane for the final occasion, but Wilma dropped below that intensity while accelerating northeastward. By October 26, Wilma transitioned into an extratropical cyclone southeast of Nova Scotia.
Wilma made several landfalls, with the most destructive effects felt in the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico, Cuba, and the US state of Florida. At least 62 deaths were reported, and damage is estimated at $29.1 billion (2005 USD, $  USD), $20.6 billion (2005 USD, $  USD) of which occurred in the United States alone. As a result, Wilma is ranked among the top five most costly hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic and the fifth costliest storm in United States history.
Meteorological history.
A large area of disturbed weather developed across much of the Caribbean Sea during mid-October as a lower-tropospheric low interacted with a broad area of disturbed weather, aided by an upper-level low across the region. A broad area of low pressure developed on October 13 to the southeast of Jamaica, and slowly became more concentrated as upper-level wind shear gradually decreased. Dvorak classifications began on October 14, and by late October 15 the surface circulation in the system became well enough defined, with sufficiently organized deep convection, for the National Hurricane Center to designate the system as Tropical Depression Twenty-Four while located about east-southeast of Grand Cayman.
The depression drifted southwestward because of the influence of two ridges to its north and with warm water temperatures and a favorable upper-level environment it strengthened into Tropical Storm Wilma on October 17. Initially, development was slow, due to the large size of the storm and a flat pressure gradient. However, convection gradually organized, and from October 18 through October 19, Wilma underwent explosive deepening over the open waters of the Caribbean. In a 30- hour period, the pressure dropped from 982 mbar (hPa; 29 inHg) to the record-low of 882 mbar (hPa; 26.05 inHg), while the winds increased to 185 mph (295 km/h).
Wilma weakened below Category 5 intensity on October 20 to 155 mph (250 km/h) due to an eyewall replacement cycle and began to turn towards the northwest and further decreased in forward speed. The once tiny eye was replaced by a eye. Late on October 21, Wilma made landfall on the island of Cozumel at around 2145 UTC with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and then again made a second landfall on the Mexican mainland six hours later and only slightly weaker. Wilma continued to slowly drift towards the north over the Yucatán Peninsula, although it weakened to a moderate hurricane while over land, it reemerged over the southern Gulf of Mexico on October 23 around 0000 UTC. Despite Wilma spending 24 hours over land, it reemerged with little intensity lost, and began to re-intensify shortly after. This was perhaps due to its large size and because the majority of its circulation remained over the warm waters of the northwest Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. A powerful trough turned the hurricane to the northeast and accelerated its forward motion. Its large eye remained well-organized, and Wilma intensified despite increasing amounts of wind shear, briefly producing winds of 125 mph (200 km/h) before hitting Cape Romano, Florida as a 120 mph (195 km/h) major hurricane (although maximum sustained winds at the Florida landfall, according to some sources, might have been stronger).
Wilma crossed the state in about 4.5 hours and weakened to winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) after entering the Atlantic Ocean near Jupiter, Florida. Key West received several feet of water in the low-lying areas and flooded homes. The Lower Keys also experienced an unusual flood: it occurred twice. First, as the storm approached Florida, it pushed water across the keys from south to north. As the storm finally crossed into the Everglades, all the water that had been pushed by the storm was released as Wilma crossed the peninsula. The water then raced back across the Lower Keys a second time and went back out to sea. This caused additional flooding and costly damage. Possibly due to less friction of the eyewall or moving over warm waters of the Gulf Stream, Wilma again re-intensified to reach winds of 125 mph (200 km/h), before cold air and wind shear penetrated the inner core of convection. On October 26, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and the next day the remnants of Wilma were absorbed by another extratropical storm over Atlantic Canada.
Wilma's rapid deepening set a new record for the Atlantic basin, and is only second after Super Typhoon Forrest in terms of the most rapid deepening phases ever undergone by a tropical cyclone anywhere on Earth. The global record for deepening is 100 mbar (hPa) in 24 hours by Super Typhoon Forrest in 1983, but that measurement is considered suspect.
During its intensification on October 19, the hurricane's eye shrank to as small as 1.5 to in diameter, becoming the smallest eye ever seen in a tropical cyclone.
Shortly thereafter, Wilma set the record for the lowest central pressure recorded in an Atlantic hurricane when the pressure dropped to 884 mbar (26.10 inHg) at 8 am EDT (12:00 UTC) on October 19. The pressure dropped further to 882 mbar (26.045 InHg) three hours later before rising slowly in the afternoon (while the storm remained a Category 5 hurricane). By 11 pm EDT (03:00 UTC October 20), Wilma's pressure had risen to 894 mbar (26.40 inHg) as the hurricane weakened to Category 4 strength, with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h). Wilma was the first hurricane ever in the Atlantic Basin to have a central pressure below 900 mbar (26.58 inHg) while at Category 4 intensity (in fact, only two other Atlantic hurricanes had lower recorded central pressures than Wilma had at that point: Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, and the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935). While Wilma was the most intense "hurricane" (a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic, Central Pacific or Eastern Pacific basins) ever recorded, there have been more intense typhoons in the Pacific.-->
Preparations.
Mexico.
Quintana Roo government officials declared a red alert on the evening of Wednesday, October 19. Classes were suspended in the state's northern municipalities and residents of coastal areas were advised to take refuge further inland; tourists in the resort city of Cancún and its adjacent islands were told to return to their places of origin or head inland while those unable to were relocated to designated hurricane shelters throughout the city. In neighboring Yucatán, classes were also suspended in 18 coastal municipalities.
Central America.
In Nicaragua, civil organizations were ordered to make hurricane preparations, while in El Salvador, the National Emergency Committee was activated.
Cuba.
In Cuba, preparations were made to evacuate four western provinces, including the Isle of Youth. In all, over 760,000 people were ordered to evacuate.
Florida.
A mandatory evacuation of residents was ordered for the Florida Keys in Monroe County and those in Collier County living west or south of US 41. County offices, schools and courts were closed Monday, October 24. At least 300 Keys evacuees were housed at the Monroe County shelter at Florida International University in Miami-Dade County. All Collier County public schools were declared closed for Friday, October 21. The schools were closed to "allow parents and staff to prepare for the storm and potential evacuation", and also allowed "for needed preparation of schools to be used as hurricane shelters." The schools remained closed on Monday, October 24, as the hurricane made landfall. Schools around Fort Myers and Tampa, as well as Sumter, Marion, Osceola, Pasco, and Polk counties, were closed on Monday, October 24. In other areas of Central Florida, schools were closed in Flagler, Lake, Orange, and Volusia counties. Schools in Palm Beach and Broward counties were closed for two weeks because of extended power outages and some damage to school buildings. Schools in Collier and Miami-Dade counties were closed for a little over a week, including the University of Miami.
Orange juice futures reached the highest level in six years on Wednesday, October 19, 2005, closing up 2.9 cents at US$1.118 per pound. As dynamic models moved the storm's track east over Florida, oil futures eased as worries of another direct hit on the oil-producing regions of the Gulf of Mexico subsided. College and professional hockey games scheduled the weekend before Wilma's landfall were rescheduled for a later time. The professional football game scheduled for Sunday was moved ahead to Friday night. A concert by the industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, expected to have taken place Monday, October 24, was postponed and later cancelled. Key West's Fantasy Fest held around each Halloween was postponed until December.
Impact.
Wilma was responsible for at least 63 total deaths and over $29 billion (2005 US$) in damages.
Caribbean.
In Haiti, the outer bands of Wilma triggered mudslides, killing at least 12 people. Damage in the country totaled around $500,000 (2005 USD).
Wilma claimed one death in Jamaica as a tropical depression on October 16. It pounded the island for three days ending on October 18, flooding several low-lying communities and triggering mudslides that blocked roads and damaged several homes. Almost 250 people were in emergency shelters on the island. Damage on the island totaled $93.5 million (2005 USD).
Mexico.
At least eight deaths were reported in Mexico. Five were in the Playa del Carmen area due to a gas explosion caused by the strong winds. Four deaths also were reported in Cozumel and another in Cancún due to wind blowing a window out. Another death, caused by a falling tree, was reported in the state of Yucatán.
Pictures and television reports indicated extensive structural damage throughout the Cancún area, as well as significant flooding and many downed trees, power lines and scattered debris. Several homes had also collapsed. Rainfall amounts in excess of 23 inches (590 mm) were reported in several areas, with Isla Mujeres reporting 64 inches (1637 mm)—five times what Hurricane Gilbert dropped. One gymnasium used as a shelter lost its roof, which forced the evacuation of more than 1,000 people staying there. During the storm, waves five to eight meters high (enough to reach the third floor of many hotels) slammed against the coastline.
Damage was extensive as well on Cozumel, with many broken windows, fallen trees and power lines, but less structural damage. It was comparable to the scene after Hurricane Emily back in July 2005, a storm of similar intensity at landfall, but faster moving.
The governor of Quintana Roo, Félix González Canto, said in an interview: "Never in the history of Quintana Roo have we seen a storm like this."
Communication was initially limited, as telephone and electric services were completely out in the affected areas; however, in downtown Cancún, some telephone communications remained intact, and tourists went out and risked their lives to contact home. There were also extensive reports of looting of many businesses in Quintana Roo, particularly in Cancún.
After Wilma passed, a sense of desperation developed in the region because people were being held in shelters due to the extensive damage. Thousands of tourists remained stranded in shelters, and the priority was to send them home immediately, according to President Vicente Fox. Buses arrived in Cancún from Mérida, where tourists were hoping to find flights home. The United States embassy told tourists to go to Mérida, although the next day they had to change their announcements because Mérida had become so packed with people. The road to Mérida was very dangerous and practically impassable for taxis, yet people dealt with the exorbitant fees being charged for passage.
The destruction left behind by Wilma in the Yucatán severely damaged the tourist industry there, as the storm affected some of the tourist hot spots of Mexico. Damage in Mexico totaled $7.5 billion (2005 USD, $80 billion 2005 MXN), of which $4.6 billion (2005 USD, $50 billion 2005 MXN) was from agricultural damage.
Cuba.
In Cuba, a bus carrying evacuees crashed, killing four people, including three foreign tourists.
Coastal flooding caused by Wilma's storm surge and flooding from the outer bands was reported in many areas, particularly around Havana. More than 250 homes were heavily flooded and rescuers required scuba gear, inflatable rafts and amphibious vehicles to reach the most severely flooded areas. Havana was also without power and wind damage was reported as a result of winds up to 85 mph (140 km/h). Officials in Cuba estimated total damage to be about $700 million.
United States.
Florida.
At least five hurricane-related deaths were reported in the United States, all in Florida, and there were at least 26 deaths indirectly related to Wilma. Damage from Wilma was extensive and widespread over South Florida due to winds and flooding. After the hurricane had passed, a storm surge from the backwash of up to from the Gulf of Mexico inundated a large portion of the lower Keys. The peak of the storm surge occurred when the eye of Wilma had already passed over the Naples area, and the sustained winds during the surge were less than .
Hurricane Wilma caused widespread destruction of critical infrastructure, including power, water and sewer systems. Florida Power and Light, the largest electricity utility in the state, reported more than 3,241,000 customers had lost power, equivalent to approximately 6,000,000 people, with most residents getting power restored in 8–15 days. Running water was restored for most residents within 2 days. Broward and Palm Beach counties were hit particularly hard by the many tornadoes in the western portion of the hurricane. Most notably in downtown Fort Lauderdale, there was significant damage to older buildings, including the Broward County Courthouse, School Board Building and taller area office buildings built before the implementation of stricter building codes after Hurricane Andrew. The glass facades in a number of downtown buildings, notably the Templeton Building, were sheared off by high winds. Damage in Florida totaled $16.8billion (2005 USD). As of 2009, there are still people waiting for insurance settlements and repairs on their homes in Dade and Broward counties.
Southeastern United States.
Few reports of effects from Hurricane Wilma exist in the United States outside of Florida, with minimal impact other than rain recorded in other states. Rainfall had extended into Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia; only a few areas had observed rain greater than two inches (51 mm). Although only one–two inches (25–51 mm) were reported in Georgia and South Carolina, Hurricane Wilma dropped approximately three inches (76 mm) of rain of the Outer Banks of North Carolina on October 25.
Bahamas.
While passing the Bahamas, the hurricane produced hurricane force winds and a powerful storm surge, flooding southwestern coastal areas of Grand Bahama and destroying hundreds of buildings. In western settlements on the island of Grand Bahama, graves were washed up with skeletal remains lying in the streets. Damage totaled about $100 million (2005 USD, $105 million 2007 USD), almost entirely on the western half of the island. The central portion of Grand Bahama, including in and around Freeport, reported minor to moderate damage, while the eastern end received little to no damage. One child died on the island from the flooding. Elsewhere in the Bahamas, moderate damage occurred on Bimini and Abaco, while islands farther to the south reported minimal wind damage.
Wilma struck the Bahamas during the filming of Disney's "". The service roads were destroyed and several trailers turned over. The two principal ships, the "Black Pearl" and "The Flying Dutchman", were relatively undamaged and the cast and crew were evacuated on the Friday before the hurricane hit.
Aftermath.
United States.
Florida's sugar industry was hard hit; the cropping had already started and had to be halted indefinitely. Damage to sugarcane crops was critical and widespread. Citrus canker spread rapidly throughout southern Florida following Hurricane Wilma, creating further hardships on an already stressed citrus economy due to damage from Wilma and previous years' hurricanes. Citrus production estimates fell to a low of 158 million boxes for the 2005–2006 production seasons from a high of 240 million for 2003–2004.
In March 2006, the National Weather Service opened its new hurricane and weather forecasting center at 1315 White Street in Key West. The center is designed to withstand a Category 5 hurricane and associated storm surge. It had been under construction during the 2005 hurricane season. In January 2006 artists were invited to exhibit sculptures inspired by the storm in an outdoor exhibit at Fort Zachary Taylor in Key West.
By late-September 2010, roughly $9.2 billion had been paid for more than 1 million insurance claims that had been filed throughout Florida in relation to Hurricane Wilma.
Mexico.
The popular Mexican resort towns of Playa del Carmen, Cozumel, and Cancún all suffered significant damage from Wilma, causing a major loss of tourism income. The MTV Video Music Awards Latin America 2005 was to be held Wednesday, October 19 at the Xcaret Eco Park (close to Cancún) in Quintana Roo, Mexico. The 2005 edition of these awards was postponed, however, because of the approach of Hurricane Wilma toward the Mexican Riviera Maya. MTV had moved the date from October 20 to 19 in an attempt to avoid the hurricane, but eventually decided to cancel the show. The 2005 edition eventually took place using a modified format on December 22.
Cuba.
The United States offered emergency aid to Cuba, and to the surprise of the State Department, the Cuban government accepted. Many times in the past, including during Hurricane Dennis, the U.S. offered aid, but the Cuban government declined. The State Department sent three damage assessors to Havana to determine their needs.
Retirement.
Due to significant damage in Mexico and Florida, the name Wilma was officially retired in April 2006 by the World Meteorological Organization, and will never be used for an Atlantic storm again. It was replaced by Whitney in 2011. Whitney will be on the name list again in 2017.
Records and naming.
The storm was named "Wilma," the first time the 'W' name was used in the Atlantic Basin since alphabetical naming began in 1950. With Wilma, the 2005 hurricane season broke the record for most storms in a season previously held by the 1933 season. Moving slowly over warm water with little wind shear, Wilma strengthened steadily and became a hurricane on October 18. The thirteenth hurricane of the season, Wilma broke the record set in 1969 for most storms of hurricane strength in one season for the Atlantic Basin.
The barometric pressure measured in Wilma, , is currently the lowest recorded pressure for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Basin, as well as the lowest pressure for any cyclone measured in the Western Hemisphere. It also reached its pressure in a span of 24 hours, making it the fastest pressure drop of any storm in the Atlantic Basin, although Hurricane Felix of 2007 reached a greater windspeed rise in 51 hours. At its peak intensity, the eye of Wilma was about in diameter, the smallest known eye of an Atlantic hurricane. In Mexico, Isla Mujeres reported 64 inches (1637 mm) of rainfall—five times what Hurricane Gilbert dropped. This set a 24-hour rainfall record for the country of Mexico, and was the highest point total for rainfall from a tropical cyclone since Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Wilma is also the costliest hurricane in Mexican history.
Wilma was the first retired "W" name since the World Meteorological Organization started retiring names in 1954, it was the strongest Atlantic hurricane to be retired, and when it was retired, it made 2005 the season with the most retired names, with five; the old record was a three-way tie with four names retired in 1955, 1995, and 2004. Wilma was replaced with the name Whitney. Had the unnamed 2005 Azores subtropical storm been operationally recognized it would have been named Subtropical Storm Tammy, and storms forming after October 4 would have been moved one name down the list. Wilma would have consequently been given the name "Alpha", while Tropical Storm Zeta would have been given "Eta", in accordance with the convention to name tropical cyclones after the Greek alphabet if the scheduled list of names runs out.

Stacey Slater

Stacey Branning (previously Slater) is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera "EastEnders", played by Lacey Turner. She made her first appearance on 1 November 2004. The character was introduced as a feisty and troublesome teenager, an extension of the already established Slater clan. She has featured in numerous high-profile storylines, including abortion, drug abuse, mental illness, an affair with her father-in-law Max (Jake Wood) and the murder of Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb). The love triangle between Stacey, Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) and Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott), the father of her daughter Lily and the discovery that she murdered Archie and her being framed for attempted murder by Janine, forced her to flee the country on 25 December 2010. Stacey has proven popular with fans and critics, and Turner has won multiple awards for her portrayal. On 6 December 2013, it was confirmed that Turner would return to "EastEnders". She began filming on 13 January 2014, for appearances between 7 February 2014 until 25 March 2014. It was confirmed on 11 May 2014 that Stacey would be making a permanent return in August 2014. Turner returned to filming, alongside Gillian Wright, who plays her mother Jean Slater, in June 2014.
Storylines.
2004–10.
Stacey, age 15, arrives in Walford in November 2004, to move in with her great-uncle Charlie (Derek Martin) after being thrown out by her mother Jean (Gillian Wright). She causes trouble through her promiscuous and immoral behaviour, and is sent back home to Jean. However, she then returns to the Slaters, eventually beginning to settle down when joined by her mother and older brother Sean (Robert Kazinsky). It is revealed that Stacey had a troubled childhood, due to Jean's bipolar disorder and the death of her father when she was 11, after which Sean abandoned the family and left Stacey as Jean's sole carer. In 2005, Stacey becomes heavily involved in the murder of Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) when she gives her cousin Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) a false alibi for his murder, landing an innocent Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) in prison. Sam's family and Den's adopted daughter Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) pressure her into telling the truth, and eventually Den's wife Chrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman) is arrested for the murder.
Despite being unimpressed by Walford newcomer Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements), the pair grow to love one another but the relationship deteriorates when Stacey discovers she has been impregnated by Bradley. When he uncovers the truth, Bradley constantly urges Stacey to have an abortion. After hours of pleading with Bradley, she finally gives up and after doing so, their romance sours. Bradley calls time on his relationship with Stacey when she embarrasses him at a work party. She confides in his father Max (Jake Wood) and they end up in bed. Subsequently, they begin an affair and Max agrees to divorce his wife, Tanya (Jo Joyner). However, he has this on a halt as he learns that Tanya is expecting their son. He leaves Stacey and she reunites with Bradley, later marrying. Max propositions Stacey after the wedding ceremony and their brief kiss is recorded on Max's daughter Lauren's (Madeline Duggan) hidden video camera. Lauren gives a DVD of the recording to Bradley as a Christmas present, revealing the fling as he plays it to the family. Devastated, Tanya slaps Stacey and Bradley ends their marriage again for six months. He eventually decides to give their marriage another chance, suggesting that they start a family. Stacey is uncertain and secretly continues having birth control pills. She seduces Callum Monks (Elliott Jordan). She immediately regrets cheating on Bradley. Although she attempts to reignite the spark in her marriage, Stacey divorces Bradley. She has a one-night-stand with Callum, which leads to them dating. They split, however, over his harsh treatment of her mother.
Following the death of her best friend Danielle Jones (Lauren Crace), Stacey begins behaving erratically. She steals money from her family, sleeps with various men on the go and becomes a heavy drinker. She is diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but is non-compliant with her medication and becomes paranoid, experiencing hallucinations. Stacey starts sleeping with Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott) and is raped by Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb). She believes that they are both planning to kill her. After attacking Archie with a broken glass and accusing her friends and family of planning to hurt her, Stacey is involuntarily committed to hospital, where she befriends Becca Swanson (Simone James).
Upon her release, Bradley confesses his feelings for Stacey and they reconcile. Then Stacey discovers she is 3 months pregnant, so Bradley could not be the father. She tells Bradley that Archie raped her and must be the father. Archie is murdered that night by an unknown assailant. Stacey and Bradley agree to pretend the baby is theirs, and re-marry on 18 February 2010. A jealous Becca reveals the rape to Archie's daughter Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack), who tells Stacey that Archie was infertile. Becca informs the police that Bradley had a motive to kill Archie. He and Stacey attempt to flee Walford, but Bradley is caught by the police and falls to his death while trying to escape. A distraught Stacey confesses to Max that she killed Archie while her world falls apart.
Stacey decides not to tell Ryan that he must be the father of her baby. He exhibits a romantic interest in her, which is later revealed to be part of a bet with his girlfriend Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). Upset by this revelation, Stacey's waters break. Ryan stays with her as she gives birth to a daughter, whom she names Lily. When Ryan later rescues them from a fire at The Queen Victoria pub, Stacey admits that he is Lily's father. Ryan initially refuses to act as a parent to her, but bonds with her when Stacey and a jealous Janine are arrested for fighting during a night out. Janine's jealousy escalates to kidnapping Lily, but Ryan convinces her to return her. Stacey and Ryan grow closer, spending time together, and they passionately kiss. During this time, Lauren (now Jacqueline Jossa) discovers Stacey's guilt in Archie's death and records a confession on her phone. Stacey attempts to flee to Palma, Majorca, but Ryan stops her, telling her he has feelings for her and wants to date her. They start an affair, but unbeknownst to them, Janine finds out, who poisons Ryan in revenge. Ryan is hospitalised and on his return, he convinces Janine he loves her but publicly declares his love for Stacey in The Queen Victoria. Janine walks in as they are in a passionate embrace. She concedes defeat until Lauren, who still believes Max is emotionally involved with Stacey, gives Janine the recorded confession. The next day, Janine attempts to play the recording in front of punters in The Queen Victoria, but it has been recorded over because Lauren warned Max. Janine says that Stacey killed Archie but no one believes her. Stacey leaves the pub in tears, followed by Ryan. She then breaks down and tells Ryan that Janine said the truth.
The next day, Christmas Day, Stacey tells Jean she killed Archie, so Jean takes Lily away from her. Ryan convinces Stacey to leave with him as Janine will call the police. Stacey lets Janine in and she attempts to set Stacey up by grabbing a knife, placing it into Stacey's hand and stabbing herself. Stacey runs out of the house and Janine convinces Jean to call the police. Stacey contemplates suicide but Max stops her and says he will help her to escape. Stacey convinces Jean that Janine has framed her. Ryan plans to run away with Stacey, but Stacey states that events have happened rapidly, and she is not sure whether she loves him. Stacey ends their romance. Ronnie and Roxy confront her, and Stacey confesses that she did kill Archie. Ronnie tells her to go, and Max drives her to the airport as the police arrive on the Square. At the airport, Max says he loves her and offers to leave with her, but she tells him she only ever loved Bradley. She and Lily then board a flight and leave the country. The next day, Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) receives a phone call from Stacey, saying that her and Lily are safe and well in Mexico.
2014–.
In February 2014, Janine is in prison, as is Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks), both awaiting trial for the murder of Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd). Stacey, still wanted by the police for attempted murder, is seen by Kat from the top deck of a bus, walking into a salon. Kat later tracks down, and visits her address, to be greeted by Lily, before meeting Luke (Matt Willis). Luke refers to "Jenny", as this is now the name that Stacey is going by. Kat says an inappropriate comment, and when challenged, she leaves, but Stacey spots her running away from the building. The following day, she goes to the Square to confront Kat. Later on, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) spots a distressed Stacey hiding in The Queen Victoria side alleyway. He takes her in to calm down, but leaves when she is confronted by Lauren. Kat and Alfie visit Luke, only to be told that she has left with Lily, without saying goodbye. Kat texts Stacey and tricks her into returning, and Luke demands to know what is going on. She reveals everything to him, and he ends their relationship. After taking Stacey back to her house, Kat visits Janine in prison, and begs her to drop her false charges from Stacey. Lauren finds Stacey in Dot Branning's (June Brown) house, looking for cough medicine for Lily. Stacey and Kat visit go and visit Janine together. Janine agrees to retract her statement, but only if Kat lies to the police, that she saw Alice kill Michael. A few days later, Luke arrives at Kat and Alfie's house, and attempts to talk things through with Stacey. However, he leaves when he finds out about her killing Archie. Stacey then decides to take Lily to see Jean, at her current address in Brighton. Janine eventually confesses her crimes to the police, and drops charges from Stacey anyway. She returns to Albert Square, and has a heart-to-heart with Dot. Not so long later, police arrive, following up a call from Stacey, and she declares that it is she who killed Archie. The next day, Ronnie visits her in prison and tries to persuade her to fight for Lily's sake, who is currently in Brighton with Jean. However, Stacey tells Ronnie that she does not want to be helped, as she thinks that Bradley's name deserves to be cleared. Two months later, it is revealed that Stacey has been sentenced to five years in prison.
Creation.
The 16 year–old actress Lacey Turner was cast in the role. Turner had originally gone to audition for a part in the Miller family, but was given the part of Stacey instead. Commenting on her role, Turner said "I was speechless when I found out that I had been cast as Stacey Slater especially as I knew I would be working with Jessie Wallace who is my favourite actress. I've watched the show since I was about four years old, and I used to live in a house that backed onto the "EastEnders" set so I used to watch them filming all the time. I always dreamt of being on the show and so I can't believe that I've fulfilled my greatest ambition!" She added, "I'm not like Stacey at all although I love playing her! She's a real challenge […] I think people are going to love to hate her like they did with character Janine Butcher."
"EastEnders"' scriptwriter Tony Jordan revealed that he created the character with Turner in mind: "I first met Lacey when she came to a casting workshop for the Miller family […] She was leaning against a wall and looked just like Kat Slater, played by Wallace. I thought she would be perfect for the Slater family so I wrote in Stacey’s character especially for Lacey."
Development.
Personality and lineage.
The character appears to be tough, stubborn, fiery and very bitchy, however, as Turner explains, this is just a front and "underneath she's very vulnerable". Stacey has been described as "sarky, sassy and...realistically streetwise." Turner has described her character as a cross between two other "EastEnders" characters, Janine Evans and Kat Slater. Indeed, her "malicious tongue and wicked ways" led to her being heralded as "a junior Janine" in 2004, by Tony Stewart of the "Daily Mirror". Turner commented, "She's very naughty, but she has her reasons for her nastiness."
Over the course of the character's narrative, it was revealed that one of the reasons for Stacey's tough and malicious exterior was her troubled family life — specifically the death of her father, disappearance of her brother, and her mother's bipolar disorder. Addressed in a storyline that aired in December 2005, Stacey returned to live with her "disturbed" mother Jean, played by Gillian Wright, during one of her breakdowns. Jean, who had "sank into the dark despair of her illness", was living in squalor, off her medication, starved, suicidal, and being abused and ridiculed by her neighbours. Stacey was forced to admit her to a mental institution for her own safety. The episodes, described as "harrowing and bleak", were praised by critics in the media. Turner and Wright were complimented for giving "graphically powerful performances", and the storyline won a Mental Health Media Award in September 2006. Prior to the airing of this storyline, Stacey was portrayed as a "hateful tearaway", but it has been commented that the episodes allowed the audience to see a softer side to the character.
Romance with Bradley Branning and affair with Max Branning.
In 2006, scriptwriters decided to pair Stacey with a new character, Bradley Branning, played by Charlie Clements. Mismatched, one reporter commented, "geeky...goody-twoshoes Bradley doesn't seem like the type of lad she would normally go for", however they added that the couple "may be chalk and cheese, but with history of emotional turmoil, [Bradley is probably just the stabilising influence she needs." The couple were hailed as the nearest thing Walford had to "Romeo and Juliet". Explaining the characters' attraction, scriptwriter Sarah Phelps has said, "Bradley's gentleness makes Stacey a little bit gentler, and Stacey's toughness makes Bradley a little bit tougher." Discussing the union between her character and Bradley, Turner has said, "I love working with Charlie — he's such a laugh. They're such different characters. It's nice, because it's not what anyone expected for her. Stacey doesn't want to rush it because he's the first person she's ever really cared about. If she's had boyfriends before, it's been all over after a week."
The couple were shown to face problems in August 2006, when Stacey declared she was pregnant with Bradley's child, and on the advice of his father, Max (Jake Wood), Bradley convinced Stacey to have an abortion; an episode that Jane Simon of "The Mirror" has described as "incredibly powerful" and "brilliantly played by Lacey Turner every horrible step of the way". Scriptwriter Sarah Phelps has described Stacey's abortion as "a dagger in heart [... Stacey thought that if this is what really wants [... 'OK I'll go through with it', but she really didn't want to. He broke her heart." Bradley and Stacey were shown to grow steadily apart after this, as Bradley invested time in a new job he acquired in city bank, neglecting Stacey's needs and ignoring her depression over her lost baby. When Bradley purposefully excluded Stacey from a work function, she showed up anyway and humiliated him in front of his colleagues. In scenes shown directly after, Bradley dumped Stacey, declaring that the reason that he wanted to abort their baby was because he could not bear the idea of bringing up a child with Stacey. The end of Stacey and Bradley's relationship facilitated a plot twist that saw Stacey seducing Bradley's father Max. In episodes that aired on Christmas Day 2006, Stacey slept with Max as payback for Bradley's mistreatment. A BBC insider commented, "Stacey likes the idea that even if Bradley doesn't want her, his dad does."
Although Stacey and Bradley split up at Christmas 2007 when her affair with Max is revealed, they get back together in December 2009 following Stacey's diagnosis with bipolar disorder (see below). Executive producer Diederick Santer commented on the storyline, saying "Bradley and Stacey are together – that's what I want, that's what the audience wants and that's what the characters want. Together, they're very strong and they can take on the world. She's good with him, she takes her medication and on the face of it, she's the Stacey Slater we've always known. As ever with Stacey, though, there's a lot hidden. There are a lot of vulnerabilities there but she and Bradley want to make a go of things."
Bipolar disorder.
After losing her friend Danielle Jones, Stacey began acting strangely in May 2009, and the character has to come to terms with the prospect that, like her mother, she also suffers from bipolar disorder. The storyline was developed as of the BBC's Headroom campaign, which aims to encourage people to look after their mental wellbeing. Series Consultant Simon Ashdown had been developing the storyline for about a year. To accurately reflect the issue, "EastEnders" worked closely with various charities such as Mind and MDF The BiPolar Organisation, medical practitioners and bipolar sufferers when researching the storyline. The story was moulded around what Stacey would do in that situation and what the research led the team to believe was the most truthful way events would develop. Executive producer Diederick Santer said that the initial buildup of the storyline was an extension of how the character has always been, "a character of highs and lows, of great passions and dark moods," but these highs and lows would become more contrasted, and viewers would realise that Stacey's mood is more complex than just being upset over her losses, adding, "It's the beginning of us getting to really know and understand who Stacey is and what makes her behave the way she does." Turner hoped that she could do the storyline justice, saying that she believed it was great that "EastEnders" continued to raise awareness of the issue.
The first signs of Stacey's odd behavior were subtle, eventually building up into more extreme acts. One of the earliest indicators was her paranoia over a poster for a fictitious video game, "Deprivation", featuring two large eyes on a black background. Ashdown got the idea for this from his research notes, saying, "There were similar sorts of images described by bipolar sufferers when they were experiencing extreme paranoia." In the episode broadcast on Friday 15 May 2009, every shot was either of Stacey or from her point of view, allowing viewers to see the world through her eyes.
Mind's Chief Executive, Paul Farmer, commented on the storyline, "It's fantastic that a high-profile soap like "EastEnders" has been prepared to tackle the challenge of exploring a mental health issue through the experience of Stacey — who is such a well-loved and popular character. The degree of research and consultancy they have undertaken to ensure an accurate and honest portrayal of how mental distress affects not only the individual but also family and friends is to be commended. [...] We hope [...] to dispel the myths about mental health problems and help the public to be more informed about this issue."
Pregnancy, Archie's murder and Bradley's death.
On 25 December 2009, storylines showed the character of Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) murdered by an unseen person when the bronze bust of Queen Victoria was pushed from the bar of The Queen Victoria public house onto his head. Prior to this, Stacey had told Bradley that Archie raped her when she was suffering from bipolar disorder and she was pregnant with his child. A live episode broadcast on 19 February 2010 revealed Stacey as the killer, moments after Bradley fell to his death after becoming the prime suspect. Following this, a two-hander episode was announced for Stacey and Max, who became the only person to know Stacey was the killer. Santer promised "fascinating" stories for Stacey and Max, saying that the two-hander will explore Stacey's motives for killing Archie, and will be a test for Max as the murder lead to his son's death. Santer explained that the murder was not a function of Stacey's bipolar disorder as she was lucid at the time, and she had several sound reasons to be angry with him – he took advantage of her, ruined her second chance with Bradley, caused a chain of events leading to the death of Stacey's best friend Danielle and drove her brother Sean out of Walford. The two-hander also explored the question of whether Stacey really meant to kill Archie. In an interview with magazine "Soaplife", Turner said that the baby gives Stacey a reason to live following Bradley's death. However, she predicted in an interview on the official "EastEnders" website that Bradley's death would lead to a permanent change in Stacey's character, saying that Stacey would struggle with motherhood.
Departure.
On 29 April 2010, Turner's decision to leave the show was announced after she expressed a desire to pursue other roles. She said of her departure: "I've had the most fantastic time at "EastEnders". Stacey has been such a brilliant role for me to play, as has being part of the feisty Slater family. I'm so lucky to have had such challenging storylines, from the affair with Max and being diagnosed with bipolar to the complete shock of being revealed as Archie's killer during the live 25th Anniversary episode. I'll miss Stacey and everyone in Albert Square very much but the time has come to try something different." Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood added: "We'll be very sad to see Lacey Turner leave the show. Lacey is one of the best young actresses on TV at the moment and the fact that she's won 28 awards in the last five years is testament to this. It's only right that someone as talented and versatile as Lacey should pursue new challenges and we wish her the very best of luck. In the meantime, viewers can look forward to a typically dramatic Slater family exit when she leaves and the door will be left open for Stacey Branning to return to Albert Square in the future." During an interview on "This Morning", Kirkwood revealed that Stacey will take centre stage at Christmas and will depart in a "dramatic plotline" and said "Christmas will be all about " and explained the storyline would be "a suitably dramatic and fitting departure for one of the all-time greats". Stacey departed on Christmas Day 2010.
Reintroduction.
On 6 December 2013, it was announced that Turner would return to the soap to reprise her role as Stacey, and would begin filming in January 2014. Turner was quoted as saying: "I may have left "EastEnders" over three years ago but the show has always been in my heart, as has Stacey, and she has never really left my side. I am so excited about returning and seeing what the future holds for her. It's been a while since I set foot in Albert Square and I am looking forward to coming home." Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins added: "Stacey is one of "EastEnders" best-loved characters, played by one of television's finest actors, and I am tremendously excited that Lacey has decided to return home to Walford. Stacey's last time on the Square was iconic. But that was just the first act. There is so much more to come for Stacey—and her return will send ripples of drama through the Square." Stacey confesses to the murder of Archie Mitchell. Lacey Turner took a break to film the new series of "Our Girl". It was confirmed that Stacey will return to "EastEnders" once filming has finished. 
Reception.
Stacey has been proven very popular with fans and has been well received by critics. In 2007, Jim Shelley, television critic for the "Daily Mirror", commented that Stacey "has been "EastEnders"' best character since she arrived...". In 2009, Shelley criticised the writers for her bi-polar storyline, as he said it "reduces her to an Issue", saying, "Making Stacey bi-polar does Turner a terrible disservice. Until now, she had made Stacey the only character in the series who was multi-dimensional." Kris Green from entertainment website Digital Spy responded to Shelley's 2009 article by saying "With hereditary connections and strong environmental conditions linked to the advancement of bipolar disorder, it's not surprising that Stacey, the daughter of Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) — a long-suffering manic depressive — has developed the same disorder. [...] Granted, the 21-year-old shoulders a fair whack of the programme, but this material is pushing her acting abilities to unseen levels. Lacey's one of the BBC soap's finest actresses and to be handed a story with scenes as powerful as those in last Tuesday's episode must be nothing short of a privilege. The subject matter, however, may be difficult and the portrayal of the condition quite probably more so. It's a given that Stacey's a superb specimen and one of the best female characters in soapland, but quite how the plot is doing the actress a disservice, I'll never know." According to MDF The BiPolar Organisation, calls made by young people to their helplines doubled in six months since the on-screen onset of Stacey's illness. The Bipolar Disorder Research Network also announced an increase in visitors to its website.
Between her introduction to the series in 2004 and the announcement of her departure on 29 April 2010, Turner won a total of 28 awards for her portrayal of Stacey. In 2005, she won best newcomer at the TV Quick Awards, and in 2006 she was awarded best actress at the British Soap Awards. Virgin Media named Stacey and Bradley as one of "Soaps' sexiest couples". In February 2011, the love triangle storyline between Stacey, Ryan and Janine was nominated in the "Best Love Triangle" category at the All About Soap Bubble Awards. Stacey's departure was nominated for 'Best Exit' at the 2011 British Soap Awards.

South Louisville is a neighborhood three miles south of downtown Louisville, Kentucky USA. South Louisville or South Side is also used to describe the entire area of Southwestern Louisville. The neighborhood itself is bounded by Industry Road, the CSX railroad tracks, Central Avenue, Taylor Boulevard, Longfield Avenue and 3rd Street. The world famous Churchill Downs horse racing track and Kentucky Derby Museum are located in South Louisville.
The area was originally owned by the Churchill family and was developed as streetcar lines extended southward to the area in the 1870s. The population grew greatly in the 1890s as many factories were constructed along several rail lines in the area, including the Kentucky Wagon Company. The area flourished and even incorporated as a city in 1886. The city of Louisville fought to annex the area, and did so after a three-year lawsuit, in 1898.
As factories in the area closed in the 1970s, the area greatly declined as middle class residents left, leaving behind only low-income residents and abandoned factories. The area began to see new development as the University of Louisville began to expand its campus southward, with a new football stadium completed in 1998 and a baseball stadium completed in 2005; both built on former brownfield sites. A shopping center was built in 2004. Several of the abandoned factory buildings are slated to be converted into condominiums in the next few years.
South Louisville is increasingly becoming an immigrant centered neighborhood, with a large Hispanic and Arab populations. Since 2006, a Mosque and several Islamic food stores have opened in the area.
As of 2000, the population of South Louisville was 4,688.

Contax N Digital

The Contax N Digital was a six-megapixel digital SLR camera produced by Contax in Japan. The camera was announced in late 2000, and began to be sold in spring 2002, after several delays. The camera received mixed reviews from the press, and was withdrawn from the market within a year of its introduction.
It was noteworthy for being the first full-frame digital SLR, with an imaging chip the full size of a 135 film frame. All previous digital SLRs had a smaller sensor, giving a cropped view (see magnification factor). The imaging sensor was a Philips FTF3020-C, which had previously been used in the Jenoptik "Eyelike" medium format digital back. Pentax also planned to use the sensor in a full-frame digital SLR, the Pentax MZ-D, but abandoned work on the prototype in late 2001. The sensor featured ISO settings as low as ISO 25, but the reviews noted that it had a relatively high noise level above ISO 100. The next full-frame digital SLRs were the Canon EOS-1Ds of late 2002, followed by Kodak's DCS Pro 14n in 2003. In 2008 Sony and Nikon also introduced full-frame models.
The N Digital was based on the short-lived Contax N range of 35mm film SLRs, and used the Contax N-mount lens system. Nine lenses were produced for this mount, by Carl Zeiss. There were three Contax N-Mount cameras – two 35mm film SLR bodies, plus the N Digital – all of which are now discontinued. 
Contax's parent company Kyocera withdrew from the digital imaging market in 2005.

The Finnish Institute for Verification of the Chemical Weapons Convention (VERIFIN) is a Finnish institute carrying out several roles in support of chemical weapons disarmament.
Established in 1994 as a continuation of a research project started in 1973, it is located within the Chemistry Department of the Kumpula Campus of the University of Helsinki.
Funded by the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, its main task is to develop improved methods of verification of chemical weapons disarmament. The particular approach adopted is to refine analytical chemical techniques for identifying traces of chemical weapons, their precursors and their degradation products. 
The institute is the National Authority for Finland under the Chemical Weapons Convention, carrying out many of the tasks required by the treaty such as preparing the Finnish Government declarations to the OPCW of inventories of controlled substances and escorting OPCW inspections of Finnish chemical production facilities. It is also one of the 18 OPCW designated laboratories worldwide for performing chemical weapons verification tests, a role it has performed since 1998.
The institute also runs several courses on chemical weapons verification for chemists from developing countries.

Medical Communications for Combat Casualty Care

Medical Communications for Combat Casualty Care (MC4) is a deployable health support information management system of the U.S. Army. 
MC4 integrates, fields and provides technical support for a comprehensive medical information system enabling lifelong electronic medical records, streamlined medical logistics and enhanced situational awareness for Army operational forces. By accomplishing this mission, the MC4 Product Management Office (PMO) provides the U.S. Army’s solution to the Presidential and Congressional objectives set-forth by U.S. Code Title 10 in 1997, which called for a medical tracking system for all deployed Service members. For up-to-date information about MC4, visit The Gateway.
Software & Hardware.
MC4 is a (semi-) ruggedized system-of-systems containing medical software packages fielded to operational medical forces worldwide. The MC4 PMO provides Army-specific infrastructure (MC4 system) to support deployment of the Defense Health Information Management System (DHIMS), Theater Medical Information Program-Joint (TMIP-J) products. The TMIP-J applications include software for electronic medical record (EMR) documentation, a web-based application that serves as a deployed EMR repository and a web-based application for conducting battlefield surveillance.
Although the MC4 program doesn't create the software, the MC4 program does provide the tools needed to digitally record and transfer critical medical data from the foxhole to medical treatment facilities around the world. 
MC4 is more than an EMR. The MC4 system is the Army's tactical medical information system including software from multiple sources, future systems and applications, package fielding and technical support. 
Deployable medical forces use the MC4 system to gain quick, accurate access to patient histories and forward casualty resuscitation information. The system also provides automated tools facilitating patient and item tracking, blood management, medical reporting and medical logistical support.
Training, Fielding & Support.
MC4 provides new equipment training while Unit Commanders are responsible for sustainment training. MC4 is always looking at new ways to provide training that aligns with its charter and resources. 
First deployed in 2003, MC4 has fielded systems to tactical medical units throughout Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar and Afghanistan, making it the most comprehensive information management/information technology medical system deployed to date.
MC4 support personnel assure system sustainability. 
This commitment is supported by regional support centers in the U.S., South Korea, Europe, Kuwait, and currently Afghanistan as well as a 24-7, online helpdesk, providing a worldwide sustainment and technical support structure.
Supporting the Future.
The U.S. Army recognizes that the MC4 system is an evolving capability required to support current and emerging medical information technologies needed by deployed medical forces. 
As such, MC4 is strategically integrating with future Army systems, including PEO Soldier. MC4 will provide an interface to these systems that enables automated assessment and remote monitoring capabilities for deployed medical forces.

<doc id="2878742" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2878742" title="Content repository API for Java">
Content repository API for Java

Content Repository API for Java (JCR) is a specification for a Java platform application programming interface (API) to access content repositories in a uniform manner. The content repositories are used in content management systems to keep the content data and also the metadata used in content management systems (CMS) such as versioning metadata. The specification was developed under the Java Community Process as JSR-170 (Version 1). and as JSR-283 (version 2) The main Java package is codice_1.
Overview.
A JCR is a type of object database tailored to storing, searching, and retrieving hierarchical data. The JCR API grew out of the needs of content management systems, which require storing documents and other binary objects with associated metadata; however, the API is applicable to many additional types of applications. In addition to object storage, the JCR provides: APIs for versioning of data; transactions; observation of changes in data; and import or export of data to XML in a standard way.
Data structure.
The data in a JCR consists of a tree of nodes with associated properties. Data is stored in the properties, which may hold simple values such as numbers and strings or binary data of arbitrary length. Nodes may optionally have one or more types associated with them which dictate the kinds of properties, number and type of child nodes, and certain behavioral characteristics of the nodes. Nodes may point to other nodes via a special reference type property. In this way nodes in a JCR offer both referential integrity and object-oriented concept of inheritance. Additional node types include the referenceable node type which allows the user to reference said node through use of a universally unique identifier. Another popular type is the versionable type. This makes the repository track a document's history and store copies of each version of the document.
Queries.
A JCR can export portions of its tree to XML in two standard formats and can import hierarchies directly from XML. JSR 283 compliant implementations must support a standardized form of SQL for queries and a query object model QOM. JSR 283 deprecates the XPath query language defined in JSR 170.
The Apache Jackrabbit reference implementation of JCR also supports the integration of the Apache Lucene search engine to give full text searches of data in the repository.
Available implementations.
Both JSRs are led by David Nüscheler of Adobe Systems (formerly of Day Software). Day had both a commercial JCR implementation called Content Repository Extreme (CRX) and was involved in the open source Apache Jackrabbit JCR, which had its 2.0 release in January 2010. ModeShape is another open source JCR implementation that supports JSR-283. Jahia, Hippo CMS and Magnolia are Enterprise Content Management systems built on the JCR API, using Jackrabbit as its repository by default, but able to plug in any other JSR-170 certified repository implementation. JSR-170 is also supported by Oracle Beehive, Oracle's enterprise collaboration software. The eXo JCR by eXo Platform is an open source repository with paid commercial support and documentation. Many other commercial vendors are working on JCR compatibility and products. Alfresco is an open source content management system which provides a JCR API onto their repository. GX released the new community version of its Web enterprise content management (ECM) platform based natively on Apache Jackrabbit and JSR.
PHP adaptions have been started by TYPO3, translating the Java API to PHP. The PHPCR interfaces are also implemented by Jackalope, a PHP frontend talking to the Jackrabbit backend through the WebDAV interface, and Midgard, a cross-language content repository.

Alaska native corporation

The Alaska Native Regional Corporations (Alaska Native Corporations or ANCSA Corporations) were established in 1971 when the United States Congress passed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) which settled land and financial claims made by the Alaska Natives and provided for the establishment of 13 regional corporations to administer those claims.
Associations, regional and village corporations.
Under ANCSA the state was originally divided into twelve regions, each represented by a "Native association" responsible for the enrollment of past and present residents of the region. Individual Alaska Natives enrolled in these associations, and their village level equivalents, were made shareholder in the Regional and Village Corporations created by the Act. The twelve for-profit regional corporations, and a thirteenth region representing those Alaska Natives who were no longer residents of Alaska in 1971, were awarded the monetary and property compensation created by ANCSA. Village corporations and their shareholders received compensation through the regional corporations. The fact that many ostensibly Alaska Native villages throughout the state were not empowered by the ANCSA to form village corporations later led to a number of lawsuits.
The regional and village corporations are now owned by Alaska Native people through privately owned shares of corporation stock. Alaska Natives alive at ANCSA's enactment on December 17, 1971, who enrolled in a Native association (at the regional and/or village level) received 100 shares of stock in the respective corporation. In 2006, the 109th Congress passed S.449 which amended ANCSA, and allowed for shares to be more easily issued to those who had missed the enrollment, or were born after the enrollment period by reducing the requirement for voting from a majority of shareholders to a majority of attending shareholders at corporation meetings.
During the 1970s, ANCSA regional and village corporations selected land in and around native villages in the state in proportion to their enrolled populations. Village corporations own the surface rights to the lands they selected, but regional corporations own the subsurface rights of both their own selections and of those of the village corporations.
Text of the Act.
The Act lays out the specifics of the corporations' status. Here is an excerpt of the relevant portion:
The thirteen regional corporations created under ANCSA are:
Alaska Native Village Corporations.
There are over 200 Alaska Native Village Corporations
AFOGNAK NATIVE CORPORATION
The Afognak Native Corporation was organized in 1977 through the merger of two ANCSA village corporations: Port Lions Native Corporation and Natives of Afognak, Inc. It is governed by a nine member board of directors. Afognak Native Corporation has many business interests. For 18 years it participated in and profited from timber development ventures on Afogank Island. It also operates a number of successful subsidiaries including Leasing, Bioenergy Operations and Oil Field Services. In the late 1990s, the Afognak Native Corporation launched a government contracting business. The Afognak Native Corporation is a wealthy corporation and was listed in the Top 100 Contractors of the Federal Government in 2010. Coming in at No. 79, The Afognak Native Corporation's contracts were $749,557,576.49. Afognak Native Corporation entities also received NASA Small Business Contractor of the Year Award in 2013. 
In 2012 the Afognak Native Corporation sued Tom and Grace Malmberg over the misjudgment of one-fifth of an acre of land in a remote area of Kodiak Island where the couple had built a home and raised their family for thirty years. The Afognak Native Corporation refused to accept a land exchange for five acres of timbered land next door to the land in question, nor would they allow the couple to purchase the land; the Afognak Native Corporation will likely burn the home and the family's belongings.

Jane Lane (Daria)

Jane Lane is a fictional character who appeared regularly on the MTV cartoon show "Daria", voiced by Wendy Hoopes.
In the show, she was main character Daria Morgendorffer's best friend and as of the show's final season was aged 18 years. She lived at 111 Howard Drive in Lawndale, and graduated from the local high school, Lawndale High. She is an aspiring artist and has created many unusual paintings, drawings, and sculptures. Unlike most other characters, Jane's bottom teeth are shown when she is talking as opposed to the upper ones. She is mostly seen wearing a red jacket, a black t-shirt, grey skater shorts, black tights and combat boots.
History.
Early history about Jane's life that was revealed during the show is scarce, but there are a few facts that were confirmed by the character herself. She was, in her prepubescent years, a member of the Girl Scouts, during which time she was forced to attend a nature camping event, a memory she detests. This was revealed in Episode #402 "Antisocial Climbers".
Other camping events Jane has partaken in include Mr O'Neill's overnight field trip to local woodlands (as depicted in Episode #402) and a summer vacation to the Ashfield Artists' Colony (as depicted in the "Daria" telemovie, "Is It Fall Yet?"). Despite these infrequent occasions, Jane remains adamant that she does not enjoy camping in any sense of the word.
Jane had her first serious romantic relationship at the age of 17 with Tom Sloane, the son of a wealthy local family and then a student of Fielding Preparatory Academy. The relationship ended almost one year later with a marked deterioration marked by increasingly frequent fights where she was typically in the wrong. As Tom and Daria's relationship conversely grew stronger, this sparked a paranoid jealousy in Jane who felt increasingly threatened by this development. That ill feeling came to a climax when she persuaded a most reluctant Daria to help her in a hair dyeing experiment that ended disastrously. At this, Jane irrationally accused Daria of deliberately causing the incident to take away Tom. Eventually with the following development of Tom kissing Daria, Tom and Jane agreed the relationship had run its course. Jane and Tom remain casual friends.
At the age of 18, Jane graduated from Lawndale High and was accepted by Boston Fine Arts College into the midterm freshman class. Because the show ended before Jane actually began attending the college, her current status is ultimately unknown, but it is assumed that she still attends the college, socializing with Daria, who attends a college in the same city, on her free weekends. Whether she achieved her possibly facetious stated goal of losing her virginity at "11a.m., move-in day" at college (Boston Fine Arts College) remains unknown.
Family.
Jane's parents are Vincent and Amanda Lane, two artistic personalities with a very relaxed, uninvolved approach to parenting. She is the youngest of the Lane family, her older siblings being, in presumed ascending order, Trent, Penny, Wind and Summer Lane. Trent is a perpetually lazy grunge rock musician who performs in the garage band Mystik Spiral (a running joke being that the band are always seemingly thinking about changing the name, but never do); Penny, a disillusioned backpacker with a fondness for animals; Wind, an emotionally damaged three-time divorcé and Summer, a worn-out mother of four, including Jane's niece Courtney and nephew Adrian. Jane and Trent were the only two Lanes residing in the Lane household for the duration of the series. With Jane at college, it is presumed that Trent is now living alone in the house, but still with a firm loving relationship with his sister Jane.
Personality.
Like Daria, Jane too is cynical with biting wit, but is better adjusted. Her longest relationship so far has been with Tom Sloane; after they broke up, he started dating Daria, a situation that temporarily caused tension between the girls. In the tie-in book "The Daria Diaries", Jane's motto is quoted as being "every cloud has a smoky gray lining".
Jane's primary interest is art; she enjoys painting, sculpting, drawing and sketching. She also has a vague interest and substantial talent for running, in which she usually participates when emotionally overwhelmed. Her favorite food is pizza and her favorite television show is fictional oddity news program "Sick, Sad World".
Jane's only real dislikes are materialism, conventionalism and commercialism, all of which her personality overtly disowns as components of a society and as social expectations. Jane also has a dislike for mathematics. In the episode Anti-Social Climbers, it is revealed that Jane hates blue M&Ms.

Garry Hobbs

Garry Pelé Hobbs is a fictional character in the BBC soap opera "EastEnders", played by Ricky Groves. He made his first appearance on 18 September 2000. It was announced on 26 March 2009 that Groves and co-star Kara Tointon, who plays Dawn Swann, would be written out of the soap, and he made his final appearance on 27 August 2009 after nearly being 9 years on the show.
Storylines.
Garry comes to Walford on 18 September 2000, along with his girlfriend Lynne Slater (Elaine Lordan) and her family. Thinking himself a big hit with the ladies, Garry flirts with numerous women and is unwilling to settle down. Eventually he and Lynne get engaged and, on 7 December 2001, marry despite Beppe di Marco (Michael Greco) trying to stop the wedding. Beppe declares his love for Lynne but she marries Garry.
He finds work as a mechanic and lives with the Slaters. However, Lynne has an affair with her ex-fiancé, Jason James. The couple pull through and decide to try for a baby. In November 2002, Garry has a drunken one-night stand with Laura Beale (Hannah Waterman) and is stunned on Christmas Day when she tells him that she is expecting his baby. Her husband Ian throws her out, assuming she has been unfaithful so Lynne takes pity on Laura and allows her to stay, much to Garry's horror, until Ian tells her that Garry is the father of Laura's baby. Lynne is distraught but eventually forgives Garry. However, the couple separate in July 2003 after Garry misses a date with Lynne to support Laura during labour. After being thrown out by the Slaters, Garry and Laura lived together, naming their son, Bobby (Alex Francis), in honour of Garry's favourite footballer Bobby Moore. When Bobby needed a blood transfusion, Laura discovered that Ian was in fact Bobby's father as Garry's blood group was incompatible. On returning from hospital, Laura tried to get Ian interested in Bobby but when he refused to have anything to do with her or baby Bobby, she kept quiet about Bobby's paternity because she wanted him to have a father.
Garry and Laura's relationship didn't last as he was still in love with Lynne and they eventually reconciled after Garry had a fling with Lynne's sister, Belinda Peacock (Leanne Lakey), in November 2003, making Lynne realise that she still loved Garry. Lynne later became pregnant with his child. After Laura's death on 30 April 2004, Bobby moved in with Garry and Lynne. Lynne struggled to accept him but was relieved when Pat Evans (Pam St. Clement) revealed that Ian was Bobby's father after finding Bobby's birth certificate. Garry was persuaded to give Bobby to Ian, devastating him; further upset occurred when Lynne, unconscious after a fairground accident, needed an emergency caesarean. Lynne survived but their daughter, Vivienne, was stillborn. Unable to forgive Garry for allowing the operation, she left Walford after Vivienne's funeral. Devastated, Garry tried to commit suicide but was saved by Minty Peterson (Cliff Parisi). Garry moves in with Minty and they become good friends, surviving Garry's dislike of Minty's girlfriends...and Minty's brief engagement to Hazel, (Kika Mirylees)- Garry's mother.
Garry becomes infatuated with Dawn Swann (Kara Tointon), but his attempts to make her notice him are rebuffed. Dawn dates other men and uses Garry's generosity on various occasions. Garry supports Dawn after the death of her fiance, Jase Dyer (Stephen Lord), and believing she has romantic feelings for him, proposes. When Dawn refuses, he storms off, terrifying the locals when his car is found at a popular suicide spot. Fearing Garry has killed himself, Dawn realises her true feelings for him and tells a crowded Queen Vic that she loves him, only for Garry to enter and overhear. Despite her initial shock, Dawn and Garry begin dating, eventually becoming engaged but in July 2009, Dawn has an affair with Garry's boss, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Minty finds out and tells Garry, who punches Phil and decides to leave Walford on his and Dawn's wedding day. He goes to a canal and boards the boat he and Minty have been keeping and as he is sailing away, Dawn arrives and runs alongside, telling him how much she loves him. He docks the boat, letting Dawn and her daughter, Summer, onboard and they sail away together.
On 21 September 2010, Minty rings Garry due to him leaving Heather and asks if he can come and live with them for a while, thinking that its time to move on.
Creation and development.
Garry was introduced in 2000 as part of the new Slater family, a replacement for the di Marco family. The Slaters were said to cause ructions among the already-established characters. Garry was described as having "a roving eye".

<doc id="2878798" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2878798" title="Polygonal fort">
Polygonal fort

A polygonal fort is a fortification in the style that evolved around the middle of the nineteenth century, in response to the development of powerful explosive shells. 
The complex and sophisticated designs of star forts that preceded them were highly effective against cannon assault, but proved much less effective against the more accurate fire of rifled guns and the destructive power of explosive shells. The polygonal style of fortification is also described as a "flankless fort". Many were built during the government of Lord Palmerston, and so they are also often referred to as Palmerston forts. Their low profile makes them easy to overlook. 
In response to the vulnerabilities of star forts, military engineers evolved a much simpler but more robust style of fortification.
The ditch became deep and vertical sided, cut directly into the native rock. It was laid out as a series of straight lines surrounding the fortified area that gives this style of fortification its name.
The ditch was swept by fire from defensive blockhouses (caponiers) set in the ditch, and firing positions cut into the outer face of the ditch itself (counterscarp battery).
The profile of the fort becomes very low indeed, surrounded outside the ditch by a gently sloping open area (glacis), so as to provide no protection for an enemy while the fort itself provides a minimal target for enemy fire, and the narrow ditch a difficult target for plunging shellfire.
The counterscarp, (the outside of the ditch) is usually vertical, while the upper edge of the scarp is steeply sloping and often revetted in stone, to help shed shells into the ditch.
Access to the fort was down a curving ramp cut into the glacis, then through a gatehouse set deep in the scarp of the ditch, reached by a rolling bridge that withdrew into the gatehouse.
The majority of the fort is underground, with deep passages giving access to the counterscarp batteries and the ditches defensive blockhouses (caponniers) from within the fort. 
Magazines and machinery halls are deep under the surface, with only the emplacements for the fort's guns exposed at the surface.
Perhaps surprisingly the guns were often mounted in open emplacements, known as "en barbette", simply protected by a parapet. This was not only to lower the outline of the fortress, but also because guns of this period were rifled muzzle loaders (RML), still using black powder as their propellant, which generated large amounts of fumes and smoke.
Because of the fast burning propellant, gun barrels were short, and accuracy still relatively low. Experience had shown that guns could be put out of action by collapsing their casemates around them by bombardment. The gun in its open emplacement was a much harder target to hit than the massive face of a casemate.
The polygonal forts provided robust and defendable gun platforms. They were built in the context of a larger defensive scheme, as forward batteries to engage the enemy and prevent them bombarding more vulnerable targets, like city rail centres and dockyards.
Forts of this style were built extensively from the middle of the nineteenth century, but the end of the century saw the development of slower burning propellants, which allowed longer guns with much better range and accuracy and that produced much less smoke, and this along with the increasing reliability of breech-loading guns, favoured fortifications completely underground except for massive steel cupolas containing the guns. 
The increasing range of field artillery also required corresponding increases in the depth of zone that forts needed to be defend to prevent bombardment of the resources being defended.
Meanwhile the development of machine guns and barbed wire offered a more flexible and much cheaper means of protecting from infantry assault compared to the polygonal fort's ditches and blockhouses.
Many of the polygonal forts continued in service, even through the Second World War, since they provided convenient strongpoints, and their open emplacements readily accepted anti-aircraft batteries and quick firing guns, but the art of fortification had moved on.

Theo Walcott

Theo James Walcott (born 16 March 1989) is an English footballer who plays as a forward for Arsenal and the England national team. Walcott won the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year Award in 2006.
Walcott is a product of the Southampton Academy and started his career with Southampton before joining Arsenal for £5 million in 2006. His speedy pace and ball crossing led his manager Arsène Wenger to deploy him on the wing for most of his career. In the 2012-13 season, a contract dispute led him to being played as a striker, before returning in the 2013-14 season playing on the wing once again.
On 30 May 2006, Walcott became England's youngest ever senior football player aged 17 years and 75 days. On 6 September 2008, he made his first competitive start in a World Cup qualifier against Andorra, and in the following match against Croatia on 10 September he opened his senior international goals tally and became the youngest player in history to score a hat-trick for England. He has represented England at the 2006 World Cup and Euro 2012 and has 36 caps, scoring five goals.
Club career.
Early career.
Walcott was born in Stanmore, London, but grew up in Compton, Berkshire. He attended Compton Church of England Primary School and The Downs School, playing football for the local village team and later for Newbury. Walcott scored more than 100 goals in his one and only season for Newbury, before leaving there for Swindon Town. He spent only six months there before leaving for Southampton after he rejected a chance to join Chelsea. Nike agreed to a sponsorship deal with Walcott when he was fourteen years old.
Southampton.
In the 2004–05 season, he starred in the Southampton youth side that reached the final of the against Ipswich Town. In addition, he became the youngest person to play in the Southampton reserve team at 15 years and 175 days, when he came off the bench against Watford in September 2004. However, he did not play in the Premier League, as Southampton were relegated to the Football League Championship at the end of the 2004–05 season.
Before the start of the 2005–06 season, Walcott linked up with the first team's tour of Scotland, just two weeks after leaving school. The striker then went on to become the youngest-ever player with the Southampton first team, at 16 years and 143 days, after coming on as a substitute in Southampton's 0–0 draw at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Championship.
Walcott made his full first team debut away to Leeds United on 18 October 2005, scoring his first senior goal in the same game. He scored again away at Millwall four days later, and yet again in his full home debut against Stoke City the following Saturday. His rapid rise to fame also led him to be named amongst the top three finalists for the prestigious BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award on 11 December 2005.
Arsenal.
2005–06 season.
Walcott transferred to Arsenal on 20 January 2006, for a fee of £5 million, rising to £12 million depending on appearances for club and country. The original fee was payable by instalments – £5 million down, £5 million based on club appearances and £2 million based on England appearances – but was revised to a total of £9.1 million by a compromise settlement agreed on 31 March 2008. He signed an initial pre-contract agreement to sign a professional contract on his 17th birthday on 16 March 2006, and was given the number 32 shirt in the process.
2006–07 season.
Walcott made his Premier League debut on 19 August 2006, the first day of the 2006–07 season, coming on as a substitute against Aston Villa and setting up a goal for Gilberto Silva.
His Champions League debut came in the second leg of Arsenal's third qualifying round match against Dinamo Zagreb, where Walcott became the youngest ever Arsenal player to appear in European competition, a record previously held by Cesc Fàbregas, and since beaten by Jack Wilshere. Within minutes of coming on, Walcott received his first yellow card in Arsenal colours for taking a shot several seconds after the referee had already blown for offside. During stoppage time, his cross beat the Dinamo defence and Mathieu Flamini scored, giving Walcott a record of two assists in two substitute appearances. His first start came in a home league game against Watford on 14 October 2006. Walcott's exploits with Arsenal and with the England team earned him the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award at the end of 2006.
Walcott's first goal for Arsenal came in the 2007 League Cup Final against Chelsea at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, on 25 February 2007, but his eleventh minute strike was overshadowed by events later on in the match as Didier Drogba scored twice to give Chelsea a 2–1 victory and three players were dismissed following a mass brawl. A persistent shoulder injury limited his performance, and Arsène Wenger even went to the extent of saying that the injury forced Theo to perform up to only 50% of his abilities.
2007–08 season.
Walcott's first home goals of the 2007–08 season were scored in a Champions League match against Slavia Prague, which Arsenal won 7–0, as well as setting up a goal for Fàbregas. Walcott scored his first two Premier league goals in a 2–2 draw against Birmingham City at St. Andrew's on 23 February 2008. He finished the season with seven goals in all competitions and four in the league. In the Champions League quarter-final against Liverpool on 8 April, Walcott made a run from inside his own half down the length of the pitch, beating the Liverpool back four to set up Emmanuel Adebayor's last minute equaliser, however, Arsenal were subsequently beaten 4–2. Later that season, Arsène Wenger claimed that Walcott was finally able to make his shift from a boy, to a man, and shall soon be a monster.
2008–09 season.
Following comparisons to former team-mate Thierry Henry, Walcott was assigned a number 14 shirt, previously worn by Henry. During the 2008–09 season, Walcott established himself as a first team regular, starting many games on the right midfield or winger. In September 2008, Arsène Wenger confirmed that Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Liverpool were all interested in signing Walcott as a 16-year-old. On Saturday 18 October 2008, Walcott scored his first Premier League goal of the season against Everton, scoring the third and final goal in the match, which Arsenal won 3–1 despite going behind to a Leon Osman goal. Three days later, Walcott scored Arsenal's second goal in a 5–2 win away to Fenerbahçe in the Champions League, rounding the goalkeeper before finishing from a tight angle.
On 18 November 2008, Walcott dislocated his right shoulder while training with England for a friendly against Germany. He made a full recovery by April 2009, scoring against Wigan Athletic to equalise before starting the second leg of a Champions League tie against Villarreal, where he scored in the 10th minute after receiving a pass from captain Fàbregas and flicking the ball over the goalkeeper. Arsenal won 4–1 on aggregate.
In the next match, an FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea, Walcott put Arsenal ahead in the first half, although they eventually lost 2–1. Three days later, Walcott came off to the bench to run half the length of the field before squaring for Andrei Arshavin to put Arsenal 4–3 up against Liverpool in the 91st minute, although the match finished 4–4. In May 2009 he signed a new long term contract with Arsenal.
2009–10 season.
Walcott's 2009–10 season was marred by injuries. He suffered from shoulder, back, knee and hamstring problems which restricted him to only 15 starts for Arsenal. He did not complete 90 minutes until 9 December 2009. On 6 March 2010, Walcott scored his second goal of the season against Burnley in a 3–1 victory to give Arsenal a decisive lead, with a left-footed effort from the edge of the box, after cutting inside from the right flank. 
Walcott scored the first of two goals for Arsenal in the first leg of the Champions League on 31 March 2010 against FC Barcelona, with team-mate Cesc Fàbregas scoring the second from the penalty spot. After the match he said, "if you look back at the game they had a lot of possession and a 2–2 draw was probably a fair result." Walcott's appearance was the turning point in Arsenal's draw with Barcelona during the first leg of the Champions League. Due to this Arsène Wenger, after much debate, started Walcott for the second leg. His appearance did not reward him with any goals but did however contribute to the set up for Nicklas Bendtner to give Arsenal the lead.
2010–11 season.
Walcott's start to the 2010–11 season was particularly successful, winning EA SPORTS Player of the Month in August by a landslide. On 21 August 2010, Walcott scored the first hat-trick of his club career after he netted three against newly promoted Blackpool in a 6–0 home win, coming in just the second game of the new season. On 27 December 2010, he scored a goal and made an assist to help beat Chelsea 3–1 in a crucial win which, according to manager, Arsène Wenger was a "must-win" game.
After an FA Cup third round match against Leeds United on 8 January 2011, Walcott admitted diving in the last minute of the game in an attempt to win a penalty kick. The penalty was not awarded, though Walcott was fouled soon after the dive, winning a legitimate penalty which was converted by Cesc Fàbregas, securing a draw for Arsenal and a replay of the fixture – which Arsenal then won. On 21 February, during the 1–0 victory against Stoke City, Walcott had twisted his leg on the turf which left him with an ankle injury. This ruled him out of the League Cup final and the Champions League knockout phase, second-leg against Barcelona. On the last day of the 2010–11 season, Walcott came off the bench to score the equaliser in a 2–2 draw away to Fulham. He ended the season with a career high of 9 goals in the Premier League and 13 goals in all competitions.
2011–12 season.
On 16 August, Walcott scored his first goal of the season in the first leg of a Champions League qualifying match against Udinese, giving a vital 1–0 win to Arsenal to carry on into the second leg of the tie. Walcott scored again in the second leg as Arsenal came from behind to win 2–1 and 3–1 on aggregate which helped Arsenal secure qualification for the lucrative group stage of the competition for the 14th straight season. Walcott scored Arsenal's first goal in the 2011–12 Premier League campaign against Manchester United though this was a mere consolation as Arsenal lost 8–2. He netted his fourth goal on 29 October in a 5–3 win at Chelsea where he picked up the ball on the wing, slipped, then got up and jinked past two Chelsea players before scoring.
Walcott scored his first goal of 2012 in the 3–2 defeat at Swansea City, chipping the ball over Swans goalkeeper Michel Vorm. On 4 February 2012, he was involved in the build-up for three goals in the 7–1 home victory against Blackburn Rovers, setting up two goals for Robin van Persie and one for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. On 26 February, Walcott scored two second-half goals against Tottenham Hotspur to help them win 5–2 after being 0–2 down in the North London Derby. On 24 March, Walcott scored Arsenal's second goal in a 3–0 home win over Aston Villa before being substituted by Oxlade-Chamberlain on the 78th minute. An injury in a 0–0 draw with Chelsea on 21 April looked set to rule Walcott out for the rest of the season but he was able to return in a substitute appearance on the last day of the season in a 3–2 win for Arsenal over West Bromwich Albion.
2012–13 season.
On 15 September 2012, Walcott came on as a substitute for Gervinho and scored his first goal of the season in a 6–1 win over his former club Southampton. On 26 September, he scored twice in a 6–1 win against Coventry City in the League Cup. On 7 October 2012 Walcott once again found the back of the net in a 3–1 away victory against West Ham United to take his number of goals already up to four. On 30 October 2012, Walcott scored Arsenal's first goal in first half stoppage time and their fourth goal in second half stoppage time in a League Cup tie at Reading to help the club complete a comeback from 4–0 down to 4–4. Arsenal won 7–5 in extra time, in which Walcott completed his hat-trick and backed up his argument that he should be played as a striker. Former Gunner Niall Quinn praised Walcott's performance as incredible, in what he described as "the most extraordinary game that I've seen."
On 6 November, Walcott opened the scoring in the 2–2 draw at Schalke 04 in the Champions League. On 17 November, Walcott scored the fifth goal in a repeat of the previous season's 5–2 win over Tottenham. On 29 December, Walcott was deployed as a lone striker and scored his first Premier League hat-trick of the season and provided two assists in an emphatic 7–3 win over Newcastle United.
On 18 January 2013, Walcott ended speculation about his future when he signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract with Arsenal. Two days later Walcott scored Arsenal's only goal in a 2–1 defeat to Chelsea. This started a run of four successive games in which he scored, with Walcott also scoring in a 5–1 win against West Ham United on 23 January, a 3–2 win against Brighton & Hove Albion in the FA Cup and a 2–2 draw at home to Liverpool. He scored the opening goal after just 2 minutes in a 1–1 draw against Manchester United. He then scored his 20th goal of the season against Queens Park Rangers after just 20 seconds. The match ended 1–0 and Walcott's goal became the fastest goal of the Premier League that season. Walcott scored another goal in a 4–1 victory over Wigan Athletic which resulted in Wigan's relegation. Walcott finished the season with 12 goals and 12 assists from 24 Premier League games.
2013–14 season.
Walcott started the 2013–14 campaign in good form, scoring against Olympique de Marseille in the group stage of the Champions League and registering assists against Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League, as well as Fenerbahçe in Champions League qualifying. His run of form came to a halt after he suffered an abdominal injury in late August. Walcott was forced to undergo surgery and therefore missed two months of the season before returning to action against his former club Southampton in late November. He then appeared as a late substitute in Arsenal's next four fixtures, assisting goals against Cardiff City and Everton.
Walcott started his first game since returning from injury against Manchester City on 14 December. He scored twice against City, but could not prevent Arsenal from losing the match 6–3. On 26 December, he scored twice against West Ham United, including his first ever headed goal. On 4 January 2014, Walcott sustained a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament of his left knee during a FA Cup match against Tottenham Hotspur and was ruled out for six months, therefore forcing him to miss the rest of the season and the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
International career.
2006 World Cup.
On 8 May 2006, Walcott was surpisingly named in Sven-Göran Eriksson's squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, despite having only made 13 appearances in senior football and none in the Premier League. Even with first-choice strikers Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen both recovering from injury, Walcott was selected over established Premier League strikers Darren Bent (the highest-scoring English forward in the Premier League in the 2005–06 season), Andrew Johnson (the top English goalscorer in the Premier League in the 2004–05 season), Dean Ashton (like Bent, already an established player at England Under-21 level) and Jermain Defoe.
On 25 May 2006, Walcott came on as a second half substitute for the England B team against Belarus. On 30 May 2006, he became England's youngest ever senior player by appearing in a 3–1 friendly win over Hungary at Old Trafford aged 17 years and 75 days. Despite being one of only two fully fit strikers in the England squad (the other being Peter Crouch), he did not play during the tournament. Eriksson defended his decision, claiming that the experience would serve Walcott well for future tournaments.
After the World Cup, Eriksson stepped down as England manager. New appointment Steve McClaren put Walcott into the England Under-21s, claiming he was "toughening up" on his squad selections.
2007 and 2009 Under-21 European Championships.
On 15 August 2006, Walcott became the youngest player ever to score for the England under-21 team when he scored the opener after three minutes in England's 2–2 draw with Moldova at Ipswich Town's ground Portman Road. The game against Moldova was his first cap for the England Under-21s.
Walcott scored two goals against Germany to seal qualification for England to the Under-21 European Championship, in the playoff second leg in October 2006, with his second drawing comparisons with Thierry Henry.
Over the summer of 2009, Walcott participated in England Under-21 team's European Championship campaign despite protestations from his club manager, Arsène Wenger. Wenger complained that Walcott's participation in the tournament as well as matches with the senior squad would lead to burn out and injury.
2010 World Cup Qualification and omission from Finals.
On 6 September 2008, Walcott made his first competitive start in a World Cup qualifier against Andorra, and in the following match against Croatia on 10 September he opened his senior international goals tally and became the youngest player in history to score a hat-trick for England.
Walcott returned to the international fold on 3 March 2010 in a friendly against Egypt. It was his first international start for nine months. He faded after a bright start and was replaced by Shaun Wright-Phillips after 57 minutes as England recovered from a goal down to beat Egypt 3–1 at Wembley. His performance came under heavy criticism from Chris Waddle who said of Walcott, "I've never seen him develop. He just doesn't understand the game for me – where to be running, when to run inside a full back, when to just play a one-two. It's all off the cuff. I just don't think he's got a football brain and he's going to have problems. Let's be honest, good defenders would catch him offside every time."
Walcott started England's friendly victories against Mexico and Japan in May 2010. However, on 1 June 2010, it was announced that Walcott had been left out of England's 23-man World Cup squad by Fabio Capello. On 4 July, a few days after England's exit from the World Cup, Lionel Messi said that he was shocked by Walcott's exclusion as he believed that Walcott could have made the difference against Germany and Algeria. In January 2011, Capello admitted that he had made a mistake in not selecting Walcott for the 2010 World Cup.
Euro 2012.
In the Euro 2012 qualifying match against Switzerland on 7 September, Walcott was stretchered off after he was clipped in the build-up to Wayne Rooney's opener for England after 10 minutes putting him out of action for several weeks.
At UEFA Euro 2012, Walcott appeared for England as a second half substitute in the group game against Sweden. Shortly after coming on, Walcott scored to bring the game level at 2–2. Less than 15 minutes later, he provided the cross for Danny Welbeck's 74th minute winner in England's 3–2 victory. Afterwards, England manager Roy Hodgson praised Walcott's "enormous" impact on the game, while Lee Dixon on the BBC said Walcott had "changed the game". Walcott also played in the final group game against Ukraine which England won 1–0.
2014 World Cup Qualifying.
Walcott started in England's 5–0 win against San Marino, but was injured in an early clash with the goalkeeper Aldo Simoncini. After treatment on the Wembley touchline, he was substituted for Aaron Lennon, and then taken to hospital as a precaution, where he underwent "scans and tests" according to England manager Roy Hodgson, Walcott was later ruled out of England's next game against Poland, he didn't start a game in the qualifiers until almost a year later on 6 September, when he played the full 90 minutes in the 4–0 win against Moldova, he also played 87 minutes in the following game against Ukraine, which ended in a 0–0 draw, but he was injured before England's game against Montenegro and he was still out against Poland, which England won 2–0 to qualify for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, in Brazil.
Style of play.
Walcott is well known for his blistering pace, with former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola declaring that "you would need a pistol to stop him." He has been likened by Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger to the club's all time leading scorer, Thierry Henry. FIFA World Player of the Year winner Lionel Messi has described Walcott as "one of the most dangerous players I have ever played against.". In addition to his speed, Walcott also possesses good balance, movement and technique.
Sponsorship.
When Walcott was 14 years old, he signed a sponsorship deal with American sportswear and equipment supplier, Nike. In November 2012 he appeared in an advert for the new Nike Green Speed II alongside Eden Hazard, Raheem Sterling, Stephan El Shaarawy, Mario Götze and Christian Eriksen.
Career statistics.
International.
"As of 10 September 2013."
Books.
Walcott currently has four published books – ""T.J. and the Hat-Trick"", ""T.J. and the Penalty"", ""T.J. and the Winning Goal"" and ""T.J. and the Cup Run"". The first two were published in April 2010, with the latter two being published in August 2010. All four were published by Corgi Children's.
In August 2011, Walcott's auto-biography "Theo: Growing Up Fast" was published by Bantam Press. The book caused controversy because of his criticism of England manager Fabio Capello, whom he describes as "cold and clinical".
Family and personal life.
Walcott was born to a black British Jamaican father and a white English mother. His family made a cameo appearance in the 2007 film "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", directed by David Yates, the partner of Walcott's aunt. Walcott himself was due to appear as well, but his commitments to Arsenal forced him to drop out.
Walcott grew up as a Liverpool fan due to his father's support of Liverpool. When Chelsea asked him to be a ball boy, he used the opportunity to meet his Liverpool idols:"I was playing in a tournament for Swindon when Southampton and Chelsea showed an interest. Chelsea invited me to be a ball-boy for a game against Liverpool and it was fantastic to meet my heroes Michael Owen and Robbie Fowler. I was a Liverpool fan simply because my dad followed them. Unfortunately I wasn't born when the team had their golden era, but I enjoyed watching the likes of Michael Owen, Robbie Fowler and Steve McManaman when I was growing up. When Liverpool won the Champions League last year, I went mad. I was shouting so loud I think I woke up the entire village where I live!"
His cousin Jacob Walcott was a trainee at Reading and a member of the England national under-17 football team appearing in the 2009 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship. His older sister, Hollie, is a bodybuilder who came second in the British Natural Bodybuilding Federation Central Championships in July 2010.
Walcott has been involved with the UK charities Build a School and Best Beginnings.
On 6 April 2008, Walcott was a torchbearer for the Olympic Flame for Beijing 2008 as it was paraded around London. He was the second last torchbearer just before Dame Kelly Holmes.
Walcott has been in a long-term relationship with Melanie Slade, after meeting in 2004 at the WestQuay shopping centre in Southampton. The couple married at the Castello di Vincigliata in Tuscany, Italy, in June 2013. Their son Finley James Walcott was born on 10 April 2014.

<doc id="2878815" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2878815" title="Ozyorsk, Chelyabinsk Oblast">
Ozyorsk, Chelyabinsk Oblast

Ozyorsk or Ozersk () is a closed town in Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia. Population: 
History.
It was founded on the shore of the Irtyash Lake in 1945. Until 1994, it was known as Chelyabinsk-65, and even earlier, as Chelyabinsk-40 (the digits are the last digits of the postal code, and the name is that of the nearest big city; which was a common practice of giving names to closed towns). In 1994, it was granted town status and renamed Ozyorsk.
Administrative and municipal status.
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with six rural localities, incorporated as the Town of Ozyorsk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the Town of Ozyorsk is incorporated as Ozyorsky Urban Okrug.
Economy.
Ozyorsk was and remains a closed town because of its proximity to the "Mayak" plant, one of the sources of Soviet plutonium during the Cold War, and now a Russian facility for processing nuclear waste and recycling nuclear material from decommissioned nuclear weapons.
The plant itself covers an area of approximately 90 km² and employs about 15,000 people.
The "Mayak" is primarily engaged in reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel from the nuclear submarines and icebreakers and from nuclear power plants. Commercially, it produces cobalt-60, iridium-192, carbon-14 and establishes conversion production with use of radiative technologies applying wasteless technologies.
The town's coat of arms depicts a flame-colored salamander representing the ecological situation after the 1957 accident.
Southern-Urals Construction Department () is another major enterprise. Its activities include construction for atomic industry needs, production of concrete constructions and construction materials.
Main products of Plant of Wiring Products #2 () are low-voltage devices for military-industrial establishments.
Radioactive contamination and the 1957 disaster.
Since the late 1940s, Ozyorsk and the surrounding countryside have been heavily contaminated by industrial pollution from the "Mayak" plutonium plant. The plant was one of the largest producers of weapons-grade plutonium for the Soviet Union during much of the Cold War, particularly during the Soviet atomic bomb program. Built and operated with great haste and disregard for safety, between 1945 and 1957 the Mayak plant dumped and released large amounts of solid, liquid and gaseous radioactive material into the area immediately around the plant. Over time, the sum of radionuclide contamination is estimated to 2-3 times the release from the explosions from the Chernobyl criticality accident.
In 1957, the "Mayak" plant was the site of a major disaster, among all the other such accidents, releasing more radioactive contamination than Chernobyl, again. An improperly stored underground tank of high-level liquid nuclear waste exploded, contaminating thousands of square miles of territory, now known as the Eastern Ural Radioactive Trace (EURT). The matter was quietly and secretly covered up, and few either inside or outside Russia were aware of the full scope of the disaster until 1980.
Prior to 1957 accident, much of the waste was dumped into the Techa River, which it severely contaminated along with residents of dozens of riverside villages such as Muslyumovo, who relied on the river as their sole source of drinking, washing and bathing water. After 1957 accident, dumping in the Techa River officially ceased, but the waste material was dumped in convenient shallow lakes near the plant instead, of which 7 have been officially identified. Of particular concern is Lake Karachay, the closest lake to the plant (now notorious as the most contaminated place on Earth) where roughly 4.4 exabecquerels of high-level liquid waste (75-90% of the total radioactivity released by Chernobyl) was dumped and concentrated in the 1/4 square mile lake over several decades.
In addition to the radioactive risks, the airborne lead and particulate soot levels in Ozyorsk (along with much of the Ural industrial region) are also very high—roughly equal to the levels encountered along busy roadsides in the era predating unleaded gasoline and catalytic converters—due to the presence of numerous lead smelters.
Historian Kate Brown’s 2013 book "Plutopia", published by Oxford University Press, presents a history of the Ozyorsk community. This, and Richland, Washington, were the first two cities in the world to produce plutonium for use in cold war atomic bombs.
The Chelyabinsk region has been reported as being one of the most polluted places on Earth, having previously been a center of production of weapons-grade plutonium.
Education and culture.
There are seventeen different cultural and public-service institutions.
There are sixteen secondary schools, two schools specializing in the English language, one gymnasium, physics-mathematics lyceum, three professional colleges, Southern-Ural Polytechnical College, Music College, Ozyorsk Engineering Institute (an affiliate of Moscow Engineering-Physical State University), and affiliates of Yekaterinburg's and Chelyabinsk's universities.

Pro-vice-chancellor

A pro-vice-chancellor (or pro vice-chancellor) or deputy vice-chancellor is a deputy to the vice-chancellor of a university. These are sometimes teaching academics who take on additional responsibilities. Individual pro-vice-chancellors may be in charge of areas such as administration, research and development, student affairs, and academic and education affairs. In some universities, there are one or more deputy vice-chancellors subordinate to the vice-chancellor, with pro-vice-chancellor being a position at an executive level ranking below deputy vice-chancellor.
In the National University of Ireland, each president of the constituent universities (being University College Dublin, University College Cork, National University of Ireland, Galway and National University of Ireland, Maynooth), holds the title of Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the NUI, though they generally only use this title at conferring ceremonies.
In the Australian Catholic University, there are three pro-vice-chancellors, each one responsible for both an area of academic affairs and a regional area. The University of New England, Australia also has three PVCs (two deans and another academic) and a deputy VC (research). In the Federation University Australia, there are five deputy vice-chancellors and one pro-vice chancellor, the most required in any Australian university due to its phenomenal growth and engagement.
In New Zealand universities, the term "pro-vice-chancellor" is sometimes used to denote senior executive positions equivalent to deans of colleges and schools in North American universities. In this case the term "dean" is normally reserved for academic administrative positions concerned with programmes and students. Most universities, however, use the term pro-vice-chancellor in the above sense.

Beadle's About

"Beadle's About!" was a British television programme hosted by Jeremy Beadle, where members of the public became victims of practical jokes behind hidden cameras. It was produced by LWT for ITV, and ran on Saturday nights from 22 November 1986 to 14 September 1996.
Format.
An example of one of the practical jokes would involve someone's car or van secretly being swapped for an identical one, and then, having a disaster befall it, such as exploding, falling into the sea, or being dropped from a great height, as the owner of the vehicle looked on in horror. After a few minutes, Beadle would appear in disguise (typically, as a policeman or some other figure of authority, and often wearing a fake beard on top of his natural beard), and interact with the shell-shocked and/or irate victim. He would subtly drop more and more hints and would remove his disguise and point a stick microphone at the person. As the public were familiar with Beadle from the earlier show "Game for a Laugh", they would then immediately realise they had been had, often with the words "I don't believe it!". A follow up series was entitled 'It's Beadle!' which followed a similar format.
Memorable pranks.
One of the most notable pranks was where Dorset resident Janet Elford was convinced into believing that aliens had landed in her garden. Members of the public were set up by a resident team of "Beadle's About!" actors including: Pam Cole, Ricky Diamond, Tony McHale and Nicholas Young.
Popularity.
At its peak, the show attracted approximately 15 million viewers, making it one of ITV's most popular Saturday night programmes during that period.
Profanity bubble.
The "Bleep!" or "Oops!" bubble used to block out offensive language was a well known feature from the show. The bubbles were simply clouds with either "Bleep!" or "Oops!" in them, the text being set in a font looking similar to the Balloon typeface. These were also used to cover up offensive hand gestures as well. 
Jeremy once revealed in an interview that during editing, they deliberately inserted "bleeps" where there were no profanities as this made it funnier.
DVD releases.
The first two series of "Beadle's About!" have been released on DVD by Network DVD.

Ten-Day War

The Ten-Day War () or the Slovenian Independence War (), also the Weekend War () was a civil war in Yugoslavia that followed the Slovenian declaration of independence on 25 June 1991. It was fought between the Slovenian Territorial Defence () and the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) in 1991, after Slovenia declared its independence. It lasted from 27 June 1991 until 7 July 1991, when the Brijuni Accords were signed.
Background.
Following the death of Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito in 1980, underlying political, ethnic, religious, and economic tensions within Yugoslavia surfaced. In 1989 Slobodan Milošević, Chairman of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Serbia since 1986, became president of Serbia, the largest and most populous of the six Yugoslav republics. As Milošević moved to consolidate power by centralizing the state, the governments of the other republics sought to loosen the central grip on power by devolving as much constitutional power as possible to each of the republics and autonomous provinces. A series of disagreements among delegates persisted until four of the six republics each made the decision to secede from Yugoslavia. Slovenia was among those republics aiming for independence.
The first action in defence of Slovenian independency, that united both the opposition and democratized communist establishment in Slovenia was, however, carried out by the Slovene police forces, members of which later organized their own veteran organization, in an action named Action North in 1989.
In April 1990, Slovenia held its first democratic multi-party elections, won by the DEMOS coalition.
Preparations for war.
On 23 December 1990, Slovenia held a referendum, which passed with 88.5% of overall electorate supporting independence (94.8% of votes cast), with a turnout of 93.3%. The Slovenian government was well aware that the federal government in Belgrade might seek to use military force to quash Slovenia's move towards independence. Immediately after the Slovenian elections, the Yugoslav People's Army (YPA) announced a new defence doctrine that would apply across the country. The Tito-era doctrine of "General People's Defence", in which each republic maintained a Territorial Defence Force ("Teritorialna obramba" or TO), was to be replaced by a centrally directed system of defence. The republics would lose their role in defence matters, and their TOs would be disarmed and subordinated to YPA headquarters in Belgrade.
The Slovenian government resisted these moves, and successfully ensured that the majority of Slovenian Territorial Defence equipment was kept out of the hands of the YPA. It also declared in a constitutional amendment passed on 28 September 1990 that its TO would be under the sole command of the Slovenian government. At the same time, the Slovenian government set up a secret alternative command structure, known as the Manoeuvre Structures of National Protection ("Manevrska struktura narodne zaščite", or MSNZ). This was an existing but antiquated institution, unique to Slovenia, which was intended to enable the republic to form an "ad hoc" defence structure, akin to a Home Guard. It was of negligible importance prior to 1990, with antiquated weapons and few members. However, the DEMOS-led government realised that the MSNZ could be adapted to provide a parallel organisation to the TO that would be entirely in the hands of the Slovenian government.
When the YPA tried to take control of the Slovenian Territorial Defence (TO), the TO's command structure was simply replaced by that of the parallel MSNZ. Between May and October 1990, some 21,000 Slovenian Territorial Defence and police personnel were secretly mobilised into the MSNZ command structure, of which the federal government was wholly unaware. The Slovenian government also undertook detailed planning of a military campaign against the YPA, which resulted in the production of an operational and tactical plan by November 1990 — over seven months before the conflict actually began.
The Slovenes were aware that they would not be able to deter the YPA forces for an extended period of time. Under Defence Minister Janez Janša, they adopted a strategy based on an asymmetric warfare approach. TO units would carry out a guerrilla campaign, using anti-tank weapons and anti-aircraft missiles to ambush YPA units. Tank columns could be trapped by destroying the lead and rear vehicles in favourable terrain — for instance, on a narrow mountain road where room for manoeuvre was limited – enabling the rest to be tackled more easily. In preparation for this, the Slovenian government covertly bought lightweight missile systems from foreign suppliers, notably the SA-7 Grail (Strela) anti-aircraft missile and the German-designed Armbrust anti-tank system. Hit-and-run and delaying tactics were to be preferred and frontal clashes were to be avoided since in such situations the YPA's superior firepower would have been very difficult to overcome.
On the diplomatic front, neither the European Community nor the United States were willing to recognise the independence of Slovenia and strongly advocated the continuation of a unified Yugoslavia. The Slovenian government sought international assistance in negotiating a peaceful breakup of Yugoslavia but was rebuffed by Western countries that said they preferred to deal with a single federation rather than numerous small states. However, the Slovenes contended that they had no choice in pushing for independence, given a perceived lack of commitment to democratic values on the part of the Belgrade authorities.
Conflict.
Slovenia and Croatia passed the acts about their independence on 25 June 1991. This "advance" on the date of independence was a critical element of the Slovenian plan to gain an early advantage in the expected conflict. The Slovenian government fully expected the Yugoslav military to respond with force on the day of the declaration of independence or shortly afterwards. By secretly advancing the date by 24 hours, the Slovenians wrongfooted the Yugoslav government, which had set 26 June as the date for its move.
Although the Yugoslav army was adamantly opposed to Slovenian independence, it was divided about what to do. The YPA Chief of Staff, Colonel-General Blagoje Adžić, advocated a large-scale military operation to remove the Slovenian government and bring "healthy forces" to power in the republic. His political superior, the Yugoslav Defence Minister General of the Army Veljko Kadijević, insisted on a more cautious approach – essentially a show of force that would convince the Slovenian government to back down on its declaration of independence. After some debate, Kadijević got his way.
It is unclear how much the civilian members of the Yugoslav government were involved in the decision to resort to force in Slovenia. Ante Marković, the President of the Federal Executive Council (equivalent to Prime Minister) is reported to have said that the federal government had not been informed of the Army's actions.
26 June 1991.
On the morning of 26 June, units of the Yugoslav People's Army's 13th Corps left their barracks in Rijeka, Croatia, to move towards Slovenia's borders with Italy. The move immediately led to a strong reaction from local Slovenians, who organized spontaneous barricades and demonstrations against the YPA's actions. There had been no fighting yet, and both sides appeared to have an unofficial policy of not being the first to open fire.
By this time, the Slovenian government had already put into action its plan to seize control of the republic's border posts and the international airport at Brnik. The personnel manning the border posts were, in most cases, already Slovenians, so the Slovenian take-over mostly simply amounted to changing of uniforms and insignia, without any fighting. This was undertaken, in the words of Janez Janša, to "establish our sovereignty in the key triangle, border-customs-air control." It also had important practical effects. The border crossings were a major source of revenue. In addition, by taking control of the borders, the Slovenians were able to establish defensive positions against an expected YPA attack. This meant that the YPA would have to fire the first shot. It was fired on 27 June at 14:30 in Divača by an officer of YPA.
27 June 1991.
Further YPA troop movements took place in the early hours of 27 June. A unit of the YPA's 306th Anti-Aircraft Regiment, based in Karlovac, Croatia, crossed the Slovenian border at Metlika. A few hours later, a column of tanks and armoured personnel carriers of the YPA 1st Armoured Brigade left their barracks at Vrhnika near the Slovenian capital Ljubljana, heading for the airport at Brnik. They arrived a few hours later and took control of the facilities. As the YPA was the federal army, its forces were customarily deployed in various places within the federal republics including Slovenia. To the east, YPA units left Maribor heading for the nearby border crossing at Šentilj and the border town of Dravograd further west. The Yugoslav Air Force aircraft dropped leaflets over various parts of Slovenia bearing the messages "We invite you to peace and cooperation!" and "All resistance will be crushed."
In the early hours of 27 June the Slovenian leadership was told of the movements of the YPA. The military leadership of the Fifth Military District, which included Slovenia, was in telephone contact with Slovenian president Milan Kučan, telling him that the troops' mission was limited to taking over the border crossings and airport. A meeting of the Slovene presidency was hastily convened at which Kučan and the rest of the members decided on armed resistance.
The Slovenian government had received warnings that the YPA would use helicopters to ferry special forces troops to strategic locations. It issued a warning to the YPA's 5th Military Command District in Zagreb that if helicopters continued to be used they would be shot down. The warning was disregarded by the YPA leadership, which still believed that the Slovenians would back down rather than fight. This was, however, a disastrous miscalculation. In the afternoon of 27 June, the Slovenian TO (Slovenian Territorial Defence) shot down two YPA helicopters with SA-7 missiles, one of them a Gazelle over Ljubljana, killing the occupants (one of whom, Toni Mrlak, was a Slovenian pilot, as the YPA's forces consisted of nationals from all the republics).
The Slovenian Territorial Defence also took up position around YPA barracks in various locations, effectively besieging them, and launched a series of attacks on YPA forces across Slovenia. At Brnik, a Slovenian TO unit attacked the YPA troops holding the airport, and at Trzin a firefight developed in which four YPA soldiers and one Slovenian TO soldier (Edvard Peperko) were killed and the remainder of the YPA unit was forced to surrender. Attacks were also launched by Slovenian TO units on YPA tank columns at Pesnica, Ormož and Koseze, near Ilirska Bistrica. A tank column from the YPA's 32nd Mechanised Brigade, advancing from Varaždin in Croatia, was blocked at Ormož near the Slovenian border and found itself unable to break through a Slovenian barricade.
Despite the confusion and fighting, the YPA nonetheless successfully accomplished much of its military mission. By midnight on 27 June it had captured all of the crossings along the Italian border, all but three crossings on the Austrian border and several of the new crossing points established along Slovenia's border with Croatia. However, many of its units were still stuck in vulnerable positions across Slovenia.
28 June 1991.
During the night of 27–28 June, Slovenian TO units were ordered to undertake a general offensive against the YPA. The Slovenian defence ministry ordered:
At all locations where RS (Republic of Slovenia) armed forces (Slovenian Territorial Defence) have the tactical advantage, offensive actions against enemy units and facilities will be carried out. The enemy will be summoned to surrender, the shortest deadline possible for surrender given and action taken using all available weapons. While in action, any necessary arrangements will be made to evacuate and protect the civilians.
Additional fighting took place throughout the day. The YPA tank column that had been attacked at Pesnica the previous day was blocked by impromptu barricades of Slovenian trucks at Štrihovec, a few miles short of the border with Austria, where it again came under attack by Slovenian TO personnel and Slovenian police. The SFR Yugoslav Air Force mounted two attacks in support of the YPA forces at Strihovec, killing four truck drivers. At Medvedjek in central Slovenia, another YPA tank column came under attack at a truck barricade, where air raids killed six truck drivers. Heavy fighting broke out at Nova Gorica on the border with Italy, where the Slovenian Special Forces destroyed three YPA T-55 tanks and captured an additional three. Four YPA soldiers were killed, among them the commander of the armored column, and nearly 100 more surrendered. Some sources claim that this was the decisive battle of the war.
The border crossing at Holmec was captured by Slovenian TO forces. Two Slovenian and three YPA soldiers were killed, and 91 YPA soldiers captured. The YPA barracks at Bukovje near Dravograd were attacked by Slovenian TO units and a YPA weapons depot at Borovnica fell to the Slovenian TO, significantly improving the Slovenians' supply of weapons. The Yugoslav Air Force carried out attacks at a number of locations across the country, most notably at Brnik Airport, where two journalists from Austria and Germany (Nikolas Vogel and Norbert Werner) were killed and four Adria Airways airliners were seriously damaged. The Yugoslav Air Force also attacked the Slovenian TO military headquarters at Kočevska Reka and flew sorties against radio and television transmitters at Krim, Kum, Trdinov vrh and Nanos in an attempt to silence the Slovenian government broadcasts.
By the end of the day, the YPA still held many of its positions but was rapidly losing ground. YPA was beginning to experience problems with desertions — many Slovenian members of the YPA quit their units or simply changed sides - and both the troops on the ground and the leadership in Belgrade appeared to have little idea of what to do next.
29 June 1991.
The outbreak of the war galvanised diplomatic efforts by the European Community to find an end to the crisis. Three EC foreign ministers met with Slovenian and Yugoslav government representatives in Zagreb during the night of 28 June-29 June and agreed on a ceasefire plan, but this was not put into practice. In the morning, the Slovenians achieved several significant military successes. The YPA troops at Ljubljana Airport near Brnik surrendered to Slovenian TO forces, who had surrounded the facility overnight. In the north, several YPA tanks were captured near Strihovec and later reorganised into a TO tank company. YPA special forces attempted a maritime landing at Hrvatini but were ambushed and repulsed by the Slovenians. The YPA-held border crossings at Vrtojba and Šentilj also fell to the Slovenian TO, who seized the federal troops' weapons and tanks, providing a much-needed boost to their arsenal.
The YPA issued an ultimatum to Slovenia, demanding an immediate cessation of hostilities by 09:00 on 30 June. In response, the Slovenian Assembly adopted a resolution calling for a peaceful solution to the crisis that did not jeopardise Slovenian independence, and rejected the YPA ultimatum.
30 June 1991.
Skirmishing continued in several places during the day. Slovenian forces captured the strategic Karawanken Tunnel under the Alps on the border with Austria and captured nine YPA tanks near Nova Gorica. The entire YPA garrison at Dravograd - 16 officers and 400 men, plus equipment — surrendered, and the garrisons at Tolmin and Bovec also fell to the Slovenians. The weapons captured from the garrisons were quickly re-issued to the Slovenian forces.
1 July 1991.
More skirmishes took place, with Slovenian TO forces capturing a YPA facility at Nova vas, south of Ljubljana. The YPA's ammunition dump at Črni Vrh caught fire and was destroyed in a massive explosion, damaging much of the town. However, the Slovenians successfully captured depots at Pečovnik, Bukovžlak, and Zaloška Gorica, taking possession of some 70 truckloads of ammunition and explosives.
The YPA 306th Light Air Defence Artillery Regiment's column retreated from its exposed position at Medvedjek and headed into the Krakovo forest ("Krakovski gozd") near the Croatian border. It ran into a blockade near the town of Krško and was surrounded by Slovenian forces, but refused to surrender, probably hoping for help from a relief column.
In the meantime, the YPA's leadership sought permission to change the tempo of its operations. Defence Minister Veljko Kadijević informed the Yugoslav cabinet that the YPA's first plan - a limited operation to secure Slovenia's border crossings - had failed, and that it was time to put into operation the backup plan of a full-scale invasion and imposition of military rule in Slovenia. However, the collective presidency — headed at the time by Serbia's Borisav Jović — refused to authorise such an operation. The YPA Chief of Staff, General Blagoje Adzić, was furious and publicly denounced "the federal organs continually hampered us, demanding negotiations while they [the Slovenians were attacking us with all means."
2 July 1991.
The heaviest fighting of the war to date took place during 2 July. The Domžale radio transmitter was attacked at 10:37 UTC (11:37 local time) and heavily damaged by two YPA Mig-21 planes. During the rest of the day followed a number of major set-backs for the YPA. The YPA convoy in the Krakovski forest came under sustained attack from TO units, forcing it to surrender. Units from the YPA's Fourth Armoured Brigade attempted to move up from Jastrebarsko in Croatia but were beaten back near the border town of Bregana. The Slovenian TO mounted successful attacks on border crossings at Šentilj, Gornja Radgona, Fernetiči and Gorjansko, capturing them and taking a number of YPA troops prisoner. A lengthy engagement between YPA and Slovenian TO forces took place during the afternoon and evening at Dravograd, and a number of YPA facilities around the country fell to Slovenian forces.
At 2100, the Slovenian Presidency announced a unilateral ceasefire. However, this was rejected by the YPA leadership, which vowed to "take control" and crush Slovenian resistance
3 July 1991.
A large YPA armoured convoy set off from Belgrade on the morning of 3 July, ostensibly to go to Slovenia. It never arrived; according to the official account, this was due to mechanical breakdowns.
Fighting continued in Slovenia, with a YPA relief force heading for the Gornja Radgona border crossing being halted near Radenci. YPA forces at the Kog border crossing were also attacked by TO units. In the evening, the YPA agreed to a ceasefire and a withdrawal to barracks. In a separate incident not far from Radenci, in the village of Hrastje-Mota, a Yugoslav Mi-8 helicopter developed mechanical problems and was forced to land. The helicopter was seized by the Slovene military, but was deemed not suitable for the newly born air force and handed back to Belgrade on 13 August.
4–6 July 1991.
With a ceasefire now in force, the two sides disengaged. Slovenian forces took control of all of the country's border crossings, and YPA units were allowed to withdraw peacefully to barracks and to cross the border to Croatia.
7 July 1991 and afterwards.
The Ten-Day War was formally ended with the Brioni Accord, signed on the Croatian Brijuni Islands. Slovenian and Croatian independence were agreed to. The terms were distinctly favourable to Slovenia; it was agreed that Slovenia and Croatia would postpone their independence for three months — which in practical terms had little real impact — and the Slovenian police and armed forces (Slovenian Territorial Defence) were recognised as sovereign on their territory.
It was agreed that all Yugoslav military units would leave Slovenia, with the Yugoslav government setting a deadline of the end of October to complete the process. The Slovenian government insisted that the withdrawal should proceed on its terms; the YPA was not allowed to take much of its heavy weaponry and equipment, which was later either deployed locally or sold to other Yugoslav republics. The withdrawal began about ten days later and was completed by 26 October.
Casualties.
Due to the short duration and low intensity of the war, casualties were not high. According to Slovenian estimates, the YPA suffered 44 fatalities and 146 wounded, while the Slovenians had 18 killed and 182 wounded. Twelve foreign nationals were killed in the conflict, principally journalists and Bulgarian truck drivers who had strayed into the line of fire. 4,692 YPA soldiers and 252 federal police officers were captured by the Slovenian side. According to post-war assessments made by the YPA, its material losses amounted to 31 tanks, 22 armoured personnel carriers, 6 helicopters, 6,787 infantry weapons, 87 artillery pieces and 124 air defence weapons damaged, destroyed or confiscated. Property damage was not heavy, due to the scattered and short-term nature of the fighting.
Holmec incident.
The border station at Holmec was the location of an alleged war crime perpetrated by Slovenian TO forces, filmed by the Austrian public broadcasting station ORF. Video footage shows a small group of YPA soldiers standing or walking slowly with raised hands, holding up a white sheet in an apparent attempt to surrender. Moments later, gunfire is heard and the soldiers fall or jump to the ground. Neither the origin of the gunfire nor its exact effect are clearly visible on the video segment. Slovene officials maintain that the YPA soldiers jumped for cover and were not hit, and that the matter was thoroughly investigated years ago. However, the incident sparked renewed public debate after the footage was shown on Serbian TV station B92 in 2006, with many claiming that the soldiers were shot and killed by Slovenian TO troops and that Slovenia is trying to cover up the affair. 
The fate of the YPA soldiers identified on the footage is disputed. One report claims that the soldiers are still alive, 15 years after the conflict. Other report identify three young soldiers as victims (Zoran Ješić, Goran Maletić and Antonio Šimunović) and claim that they were killed in the Holmec incident.
Strategic aspects of the war.
The actions of Slovenia's forces were largely dictated by the military strategy devised some months before and were tightly integrated with an equally detailed media management plan. An international media centre was established prior to the outbreak of conflict with Jelko Kacin designated to act as information minister and Slovenia's public face to the world. The Slovenian government and media successfully presented the conflict to Western European audiences as a case of a "David versus Goliath" struggle between an emerging democracy and an authoritarian communist state, and the columns of Yugoslav tanks brought to mind the events of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 two years earlier. This won considerable international sympathy and favourable media coverage for the cause of independent Slovenia.
The Slovenians had the advantage of superior morale, compared to their adversaries in the Yugoslav army. Many of the Yugoslav soldiers did not realise they were taking part in a real military operation, rather than an exercise, until they came under attack. The officer corps was dominated by Serbs and Montenegrins and in many cases ideologically committed to Yugoslav unity. The rank and file troops however were conscripts, many of whom had no strong motivation in fighting against the Slovenes. Of the soldiers of the 5th Military District, which was in action in Slovenia, in 1990 30% were Albanians, 20% Croats, 15 to 20% Serbs and Montenegrins, 10% Bosniaks, and 8% Slovenes.
The Slovenian strategy relied on a number of risky gambles. Slovenia could not have resisted the YPA for long had the full weight of the federal army been brought into action, but its leaders had gambled on the YPA leadership's unwillingness to risk mass civilian casualties. In the diplomatic arena, the Slovenian government had gambled that the international community would step in to press the Yugoslavs to desist — in both suppositions they were proven correct.
The Slovenians were also well aware that the Serbian government of Slobodan Milošević was not particularly concerned about Slovenia's independence, given the lack of any significant Serbian minority in the country. On 30 June, Defence Minister General Kadijević suggested to the Yugoslav federal presidency a massive attack on Slovenia to break down the unexpectedly heavy resistance. But the Serb representative, Borisav Jović, shocked the military establishment by declaring that Serbia did not support further military action against Slovenia. Serbia was at this point more concerned with the situation in Croatia; even before the war had ended, YPA troops were already repositioning themselves for the imminent war in Croatia.
Consequences of the war.
For Slovenia, the war marked the decisive defence of its independence in regard to Yugoslavia. It was officially recognised by all European Community member states on 15 January 1992 and joined the United Nations on 22 May.
With Croatia as a buffer between Slovenia and Serbia, Slovenia was able to maintain its independence and position as the most stable and prosperous of the former Yugoslav republics and joined the European Union on 1 May 2004.
The war led to a series of major shifts on the Yugoslav side. The YPA eventually lost nearly all of its Slovenian and Croat personnel, becoming an almost entirely Serbian and Montenegrin force. Its poor performance in Slovenia and later in Croatia discredited its leadership — Kadijević resigned as defence minister in January 1992, and Adžić was forced into medical retirement shortly afterwards.
The Slovenian and Croatian governments were urged by the European Commission to freeze their declaration of independence for a period of three months, hoping to ease tension, to which Slovenia and Croatia agreed. Slovenia used the period to consolidate its institutions, deliver some of the most urgent economic reforms and prepare for international recognition of the country.

Financial crisis

The term financial crisis is applied broadly to a variety of situations in which some financial assets suddenly lose a large part of their nominal value. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, many financial crises were associated with banking panics, and many recessions coincided with these panics. Other situations that are often called financial crises include stock market crashes and the bursting of other financial bubbles, currency crises, and sovereign defaults. Financial crises directly result in a loss of paper wealth but do not necessarily result in changes in the real economy.
Many economists have offered theories about how financial crises develop and how they could be prevented. There is no consensus, however, and financial crises continue to occur from time to time.
Types of financial crisis.
Banking crisis.
When a bank suffers a sudden rush of withdrawals by depositors, this is called a "bank run". Since banks lend out most of the cash they receive in deposits (see fractional-reserve banking), it is difficult for them to quickly pay back all deposits if these are suddenly demanded, so a run renders the bank insolvent, causing customers to lose their deposits, to the extent that they are not covered by deposit insurance. An event in which bank runs are widespread is called a "systemic banking crisis" or "banking panic".
Examples of bank runs include the run on the Bank of the United States in 1931 and the run on Northern Rock in 2007.
Banking crises generally occur after periods of risky lending and resulting loan defaults.
Speculative bubbles and crashes.
A speculative bubble exists in the event of large, sustained overpricing of some class of assets. One factor that frequently contributes to a bubble is the presence of buyers who purchase an asset based solely on the expectation that they can later resell it at a higher price, rather than calculating the income it will generate in the future. If there is a bubble, there is also a risk of a "crash" in asset prices: market participants will go on buying only as long as they expect others to buy, and when many decide to sell the price will fall. However, it is difficult to predict whether an asset's price actually equals its fundamental value, so it is hard to detect bubbles reliably. Some economists insist that bubbles never or almost never occur.
Well-known examples of bubbles (or purported bubbles) and crashes in stock prices and other asset prices include the Dutch tulip mania, the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the Japanese property bubble of the 1980s, the crash of the dot-com bubble in 2000–2001, and the now-deflating United States housing bubble. The 2000s sparked a real estate bubble where housing prices were increasing significantly as an asset good.
International financial crises.
When a country that maintains a fixed exchange rate is suddenly forced to devalue its currency because of a speculative attack, this is called a "currency crisis" or "balance of payments crisis". When a country fails to pay back its sovereign debt, this is called a "sovereign default". While devaluation and default could both be voluntary decisions of the government, they are often perceived to be the involuntary results of a change in investor sentiment that leads to a sudden stop in capital inflows or a sudden increase in capital flight.
Several currencies that formed part of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism suffered crises in 1992–93 and were forced to devalue or withdraw from the mechanism. Another round of currency crises took place in Asia in 1997–98. Many Latin American countries defaulted on their debt in the early 1980s. The 1998 Russian financial crisis resulted in a devaluation of the ruble and default on Russian government bonds.
Wider economic crisis.
Negative GDP growth lasting two or more quarters is called a "recession". An especially prolonged or severe recession may be called a "depression", while a long period of slow but not necessarily negative growth is sometimes called economic stagnation.
Some economists argue that many recessions have been caused in large part by financial crises. One important example is the Great Depression, which was preceded in many countries by bank runs and stock market crashes. The subprime mortgage crisis and the bursting of other real estate bubbles around the world also led to recession in the U.S. and a number of other countries in late 2008 and 2009.
Some economists argue that financial crises are caused by recessions instead of the other way around, and that even where a financial crisis is the initial shock that sets off a recession, other factors may be more important in prolonging the recession. In particular, Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz argued that the initial economic decline associated with the crash of 1929 and the bank panics of the 1930s would not have turned into a prolonged depression if it had not been reinforced by monetary policy mistakes on the part of the Federal Reserve, a position supported by Ben Bernanke.
Causes and consequences of financial crisis.
Strategic complementarities in financial markets.
It is often observed that successful investment requires each investor in a financial market to guess what other investors will do. George Soros has called this need to guess the intentions of others 'reflexivity'. Similarly, John Maynard Keynes compared financial markets to a beauty contest game in which each participant tries to predict which model "other" participants will consider most beautiful. Circularity and self-fulfilling prophecies may be exaggerated when reliable information is not available because of opaque disclosures or a lack of disclosure.
Furthermore, in many cases investors have incentives to coordinate their choices. For example, someone who thinks other investors want to buy lots of Japanese yen may expect the yen to rise in value, and therefore has an incentive to buy yen too. Likewise, a depositor in IndyMac Bank who expects other depositors to withdraw their funds may expect the bank to fail, and therefore has an incentive to withdraw too. Economists call an incentive to mimic the strategies of others "strategic complementarity".
It has been argued that if people or firms have a sufficiently strong incentive to do the same thing they expect others to do, then "self-fulfilling prophecies" may occur. For example, if investors expect the value of the yen to rise, this may cause its value to rise; if depositors expect a bank to fail this may cause it to fail. Therefore, financial crises are sometimes viewed as a vicious circle in which investors shun some institution or asset because they expect others to do so.
Leverage.
"Leverage", which means borrowing to finance investments, is frequently cited as a contributor to financial crises. When a financial institution (or an individual) only invests its own money, it can, in the very worst case, lose its own money. But when it borrows in order to invest more, it can potentially earn more from its investment, but it can also lose more than all it has. Therefore leverage magnifies the potential returns from investment, but also creates a risk of bankruptcy. Since bankruptcy means that a firm fails to honor all its promised payments to other firms, it may spread financial troubles from one firm to another (see 'Contagion' below).
The average degree of leverage in the economy often rises prior to a financial crisis. For example, borrowing to finance investment in the stock market ("margin buying") became increasingly common prior to the Wall Street Crash of 1929. In addition, some scholars have argued that financial institutions can contribute to fragility by hiding leverage, and thereby contributing to underpricing of risk.
Asset-liability mismatch.
Another factor believed to contribute to financial crises is "asset-liability mismatch", a situation in which the risks associated with an institution's debts and assets are not appropriately aligned. For example, commercial banks offer deposit accounts which can be withdrawn at any time and they use the proceeds to make long-term loans to businesses and homeowners. The mismatch between the banks' short-term liabilities (its deposits) and its long-term assets (its loans) is seen as one of the reasons bank runs occur (when depositors panic and decide to withdraw their funds more quickly than the bank can get back the proceeds of its loans). Likewise, Bear Stearns failed in 2007–08 because it was unable to renew the short-term debt it used to finance long-term investments in mortgage securities.
In an international context, many emerging market governments are unable to sell bonds denominated in their own currencies, and therefore sell bonds denominated in US dollars instead. This generates a mismatch between the currency denomination of their liabilities (their bonds) and their assets (their local tax revenues), so that they run a risk of sovereign default due to fluctuations in exchange rates.
Uncertainty and herd behavior.
Many analyses of financial crises emphasize the role of investment mistakes caused by
lack of knowledge or the imperfections of human reasoning. Behavioral finance studies
errors in economic and quantitative reasoning. Psychologist Torbjorn K A Eliazon has also analyzed failures
of economic reasoning in his concept of 'œcopathy'.
Historians, notably Charles P. Kindleberger, have pointed out that crises
often follow soon after major financial or technical innovations that present
investors with new types of financial opportunities, which he called "displacements"
of investors' expectations.
Early examples include the South Sea Bubble and Mississippi Bubble of 1720,
which occurred when the notion of investment in shares of company stock was
itself new and unfamiliar,
and the Crash of 1929, which followed the introduction of new electrical and transportation
technologies.
More recently, many financial crises followed changes in the investment
environment brought about by financial deregulation, and the crash of the dot com bubble
in 2001 arguably began with "irrational exuberance" about Internet technology.
Unfamiliarity with recent technical and financial innovations may help explain how
investors sometimes grossly overestimate asset values. Also, if the first investors
in a new class of assets (for example, stock in "dot com" companies)
profit from rising asset values as other investors learn about the innovation
(in our example, as others learn about the potential of the Internet),
then still more others may follow their example, driving the price even higher
as they rush to buy in hopes of similar profits. If such "herd behavior" causes
prices to spiral up far above the true value of the assets, a crash may become inevitable.
If for any reason the price briefly falls, so that investors realize
that further gains are not assured, then the spiral may go into reverse,
with price decreases causing a rush of sales, reinforcing the decrease in prices.
Regulatory failures.
Governments have attempted to eliminate or mitigate financial crises by regulating the financial sector. One major goal of regulation is transparency: making institutions' financial situations publicly known by requiring regular reporting under standardized accounting procedures. Another goal of regulation is making sure institutions have sufficient assets to meet their contractual obligations, through reserve requirements, capital requirements, and other limits on leverage.
Some financial crises have been blamed on insufficient regulation, and have led to changes in regulation in order to avoid a repeat. For example, the former Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, has blamed the financial crisis of 2008 on 'regulatory failure to guard against excessive risk-taking in the financial system, especially in the US'. Likewise, the New York Times singled out the deregulation of credit default swaps as a cause of the crisis.
However, excessive regulation has also been cited as a possible cause of financial crises. In particular, the Basel II Accord has been criticized for requiring banks to increase their capital when risks rise, which might cause them to decrease lending precisely when capital is scarce, potentially aggravating a financial crisis.
International regulatory convergence has been interpreted in terms of regulatory herding, deepening market herding (discussed above) and so increasing systemic risk. From this perspective, maintaining diverse regulatory regimes would be a safeguard.
Fraud has played a role in the collapse of some financial institutions, when companies have attracted depositors with misleading claims about their investment strategies, or have embezzled the resulting income. Examples include Charles Ponzi's scam in early 20th century Boston, the collapse of the MMM investment fund in Russia in 1994, the scams that led to the Albanian Lottery Uprising of 1997, and the collapse of Madoff Investment Securities in 2008.
Many rogue traders that have caused large losses at financial institutions have been accused of acting fraudulently in order to hide their trades. Fraud in mortgage financing has also been cited as one possible cause of the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis; government officials stated on September 23, 2008 that the FBI was looking into possible fraud by mortgage financing companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, and insurer American International Group. Likewise it has been argued that many financial companies failed in the recent crisis because their managers failed to carry out their fiduciary duties.
Contagion.
"Contagion" refers to the idea that financial crises may spread from one institution to another, as when a bank run spreads from a few banks to many others, or from one country to another, as when currency crises, sovereign defaults, or stock market crashes spread across countries. When the failure of one particular financial institution threatens the stability of many other institutions, this is called "systemic risk".
One widely cited example of contagion was the spread of the Thai crisis in 1997 to other countries like South Korea. However, economists often debate whether observing crises in many countries around the same time is truly caused by contagion from one market to another, or whether it is instead caused by similar underlying problems that would have affected each country individually even in the absence of international linkages.
Recessionary effects.
Some financial crises have little effect outside of the financial sector, like the Wall Street crash of 1987, but other crises are believed to have played a role in decreasing growth in the rest of the economy. There are many theories why a financial crisis could have a recessionary effect on the rest of the economy. These theoretical ideas include the 'financial accelerator', 'flight to quality' and 'flight to liquidity', and the Kiyotaki-Moore model. Some 'third generation' models of currency crises explore how currency crises and banking crises together can cause recessions.
Theories of financial crisis.
Austrian theories.
Austrian School economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek discussed the business cycle starting with Mises' "Theory of Money and Credit", published in 1912.
Marxist theories.
Recurrent major depressions in the world economy at the pace of 20 and 50 years (often referred to as the business cycle) have been the subject of studies since Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi (1773–1842) provided the first theory of crisis in a critique of classical political economy's assumption of equilibrium between supply and demand. Developing an economic crisis theory became the central recurring concept throughout Karl Marx's mature work. Marx's law of the tendency for the rate of profit to fall borrowed many features of the presentation of John Stuart Mill's discussion "Of the Tendency of Profits to a Minimum" (Principles of Political Economy Book IV Chapter IV). The theory is a corrollary of the "Tendency towards the Centralization of Profits".
In a capitalist system, successfully-operating businesses return less money to their workers (in the form of wages) than the value of the goods produced by those workers (i.e. the amount of money the products are sold for). This profit first goes towards covering the initial investment in the business. In the long-run, however, when one considers the combined economic activity of all successfully-operating business, it is clear that less money (in the form of wages) is being returned to the mass of the population (the workers) than is available to them to buy all of these goods being produced. Furthermore, the expansion of businesses in the process of competing for markets leads to an abundance of goods and a general fall in their prices, further exacerbating "the tendency for the rate of profit to fall".
The viability of this theory depends upon two main factors: firstly, the degree to which profit is taxed by government and returned to the mass of people in the form of welfare, family benefits and health and education spending; and secondly, the proportion of the population who are workers rather than investors/business owners. Given the extraordinary capital expenditure required to enter modern economic sectors like airline transport, the military industry, or chemical production, these sectors are extremely difficult for new businesses to enter and are being concentrated in fewer and fewer hands.
Empirical and econometric research continue especially in the world systems theory and in the debate about Nikolai Kondratiev and the so-called 50-years Kondratiev waves. Major figures of world systems theory, like Andre Gunder Frank and Immanuel Wallerstein, consistently warned about the crash that the world economy is now facing. World systems scholars and Kondratiev cycle researchers always implied that Washington Consensus oriented economists never understood the dangers and perils, which leading industrial nations will be facing and are now facing at the end of the long economic cycle which began after the oil crisis of 1973.
Minsky's theory.
Hyman Minsky has proposed a post-Keynesian explanation that is most applicable to a closed economy. He theorized that financial fragility is a typical feature of any capitalist economy. High fragility leads to a higher risk of a financial crisis. To facilitate his analysis, Minsky defines three approaches to financing firms may choose, according to their tolerance of risk. They are hedge finance, speculative finance, and Ponzi finance. Ponzi finance leads to the most fragility.
Financial fragility levels move together with the business cycle. After a recession, firms have lost much financing and choose only hedge, the safest. As the economy grows and expected profits rise, firms tend to believe that they can allow themselves to take on speculative financing. In this case, they know that profits will not cover all the interest all the time. Firms, however, believe that profits will rise and the loans will eventually be repaid without much trouble. More loans lead to more investment, and the economy grows further. Then lenders also start believing that they will get back all the money they lend. Therefore, they are ready to lend to firms without full guarantees of success.
Lenders know that such firms will have problems repaying. Still, they believe these firms will refinance from elsewhere as their expected profits rise. This is Ponzi financing. In this way, the economy has taken on much risky credit. Now it is only a question of time before some big firm actually defaults. Lenders understand the actual risks in the economy and stop giving credit so easily. Refinancing becomes impossible for many, and more firms default. If no new money comes into the economy to allow the refinancing process, a real economic crisis begins. During the recession, firms start to hedge again, and the cycle is closed.
Coordination games.
Mathematical approaches to modeling financial crises have emphasized that there is often positive feedback between market participants' decisions (see strategic complementarity). Positive feedback implies that there may be dramatic changes in asset values in response to small changes in economic fundamentals. For example, some models of currency crises (including that of Paul Krugman) imply that a fixed exchange rate may be stable for a long period of time, but will collapse suddenly in an avalanche of currency sales in response to a sufficient deterioration of government finances or underlying economic conditions.
According to some theories, positive feedback implies that the economy can have more than one equilibrium. There may be an equilibrium in which market participants invest heavily in asset markets because they expect assets to be valuable, but there may be another equilibrium where participants flee asset markets because they expect others to flee too. This is the type of argument underlying Diamond and Dybvig's model of bank runs, in which savers withdraw their assets from the bank because they expect others to withdraw too. Likewise, in Obstfeld's model of currency crises, when economic conditions are neither too bad nor too good, there are two possible outcomes: speculators may or may not decide to attack the currency depending on what they expect other speculators to do.
Herding models and learning models.
A variety of models have been developed in which asset values may spiral excessively up or down
as investors learn from each other. In these models, asset purchases by a few agents
encourage others to buy too, not because the true value of the asset increases
when many buy (which is called "strategic complementarity"), but because
investors come to believe the true asset value is high when they observe others buying.
In "herding" models, it is assumed that investors are fully rational, but only have partial
information about the economy. In these models, when a few investors buy some type of asset,
this reveals that they have some positive information about that asset,
which increases the rational incentive of others to buy the asset too. Even though this is a fully
rational decision, it may sometimes lead to mistakenly high asset values (implying, eventually, a crash)
since the first investors may, by chance, have been mistaken.
In "adaptive learning" or "adaptive expectations" models, investors are assumed to be
imperfectly rational, basing their reasoning only on recent experience. In such models,
if the price of a given asset rises for some period of time, investors may begin to believe
that its price always rises, which increases their tendency to buy and thus drives the
price up further. Likewise, observing a few price decreases may give rise to a downward
price spiral, so in models of this type large fluctuations in asset prices may occur.
Agent-based models
of financial markets often assume investors act on the
basis of adaptive learning or adaptive expectations.
History.
A noted survey of financial crises is "This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly" , by economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, who are regarded as among the foremost historians of financial crises. In this survey, they trace the history of financial crisis back to sovereign defaults – default on "public" debt, – which were the form of crisis prior to the 18th century and continue, then and now causing private bank failures; crises since the 18th century feature both public debt default and private debt default. Reinhart and Rogoff also class debasement of currency and hyperinflation as being forms of financial crisis, broadly speaking, because they lead to unilateral reduction (repudiation) of debt.
Prior to 19th century.
Reinhart and Rogoff trace inflation (to reduce debt) to Dionysius of Syracuse, of the 4th century BCE, and begin their "eight centuries" in 1258; debasement of currency also occurred under the Roman empire and Byzantine empire.
Among the earliest crises Reinhart and Rogoff study is the 1340 default of England, due to setbacks in its war with France (the Hundred Years' War; see details). Further early sovereign defaults include seven defaults by imperial Spain, four under Philip II, three under his successors.
Other global and national financial mania since the 17th century include:

List of Ace double novels

Ace Books began publishing genre fiction starting in 1952. Initially these were mostly in the attractive tête-bêche format, but they also published a few single volumes, in the early years, and that number grew until the doubles stopped appearing in about 1978. The tête-bêche format was discarded in 1973, but future double novels were continued for a while.
Between 1952 and 1968, the books had a letter-series identifier; after that date they were given five-digit numeric serial numbers. The list given here covers every Ace Double published between 1952 and 1978, for all genres. It gives a date of publication; in all cases this refers to the date of publication by Ace, and not the date of original publication of the novels. For more information about the history of these titles, see Ace Books, which includes a discussion of the serial numbering conventions used and an explanation of the letter-code system.
Genres and collectability.
Ace published science fiction, mysteries, and westerns, as well as books not in any of these genres. Collectors of these genres have found the Ace doubles an attractive set of books to collect, because of the unusual appearance of the tête-bêche format. This is particularly true for the science fiction books, for which several bibliographic references have been written (see the References section). The format inspired a further series of sf doubles published by Tor Books between 1988 and 1991, the Tor Double Novels.
Because the tête-bêche format is part of the attraction for collectors, titles published between 1974 and 1978, which contained two titles by one or two authors but which are not tête-bêche, are not regarded by some collectors as true Ace Doubles. The distinction is up to each collector; the books are included in the list given below, with the difference in format noted.
The list given here includes an indication of the genre of the works, in italics after the serial number. Abbreviations used are "SF" for science fiction titles; "MY" for mystery titles, and "WE" for westerns. In addition, "NA" is used to mean "not applicable", when one or both of the books is not in one of these three genres; and "UN", when the genre of the books is not known. The list also gives a date of publication; in all cases this refers to the date of publication by Ace, and not the date of original publication of the novels.
The list is thought to be complete, but there may be minor omissions among the later lists.
For more information about the history of these titles, see Ace Books, which includes a discussion of the serial numbering conventions used and an explanation of the letter-code system.
Jokes.
The double format inspired contests for ironic or satirical combinations of titles that might appear, as in "No Blade of Grass"/"The Sheep Look Up"

Needham Market railway station

Needham Market is a railway station serving the town of Needham Market in Suffolk, England. The station is located on the Great Eastern Main Line from London Liverpool Street to Norwich. The Station is served regularly served by trains between Ipswich and Cambridge.
The station is served by Greater Anglia.
History.
The station was opened as Needham by the Ipswich and Bury Railway in 1846. The main building ("one of the best in East Anglia" - Biddle) was designed in a grand Jacobean style with decorative brickwork by Frederick Barnes and was completed by the contractor, Daniel Revitt, in 1849. It was very slightly simplified, and the platforms rebuilt, by the London and North Eastern Railway. The station was closed to passengers by the Eastern Region of British Railways in 1967 but reopened as Needham Market in 1971. The main building, not now in railway use, is Grade II listed and was restored in 2000 by Spacia Ltd, being given an award in the 2002 National Railway Heritage Awards.

Politiets Aktionsstyrke

Politiets Aktionsstyrke (AKS, translation: "The Police's Action Force") is the special response unit of the Danish police.
AKS is a national SWAT unit. It is meant to handle extraordinarily difficult or life-threatening criminal situations, such as terrorism, hostage situations, and kidnapping. It also deals with emergency rescue situations that would be too dangerous for others to handle. The AKS holds responsibility for all anti-terror and counter-terrorism missions in Denmark. It is known that AKS cross-trains with the army and navy elite-units Jægerkorpset and Frømandskorpset.
Their training includes :Tactical shooting, hand-to-hand combat, surveillance, and explosives. Policemen who want to join the unit are required take and pass selection tests.
History.
The unit's operational functions are closely guarded secrets, so not much is known. What has been published is that the unit was created just after the Munich Summer Olympic incident in 1972.
In 1998 the unit was re-organized to include a permanent force of roughly 100 police officers; it previously "borrowed" officers from regular units on an "as needed" basis.
AKS led the operation of clearing and evicting the anarchist and leftist groups from Ungdomshuset on March 1, 2007.
Its activities are under the jurisdiction of the Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET).
An officer from AKS was seriously wounded on January 7, 2013, during an arrest operation against three suspected narcotics smugglers. The suspected perpetrator was killed by a headshot and another man was wounded. A third man was arrested. It was the first time that an AKS-officer had been wounded during an operation.

Virginia Robinson Gardens

The Virginia Robinson Gardens are the period landscape, historic mansion, and botanical gardens located at the Virginia Robinson Estate ( ) in Beverly Hills, California, United States.
History.
The Virginia Robinson Gardens is the earliest estate in Beverly Hills, California. It was the private residence of Virginia Dryden Robinson (1877-1977) and Harry Winchester Robinson (1878-1932), heir to Robinson & Co..
The main house was designed in 1911 by architect Nathaniel Dryden (1849-1924), who was Virginia's father, in a Beaux Arts style. The residence is furnished with antiques and artifacts collected from around the world.
The Renaissance Revival Pool Pavilion was built in 1924 and is modeled after the Villa Pisani in the Tuscan region of Italy. Decorative panels of Sgraffito ornamentation adorn the Roman arches at the entry to the pavilion's Solarium. The Pavilion overlooks a long pool with mosaic tile wainscoting.

Edward Evarts

Edward Vaughan Evarts (1926–1985) was an American neuroscientist. He pioneered single-unit recordings from the brains of awake, behaving monkeys.
Life.
Evarts received his undergraduate degree at Harvard College and an M.D. degree from Harvard Medical School in 1948. Evarts undertook an internship at Boston's Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, worked with Karl Lashley at Yerkes Laboratories of Primate Biology in Orange Park, Florida, and at the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases in London. After a residency in psychiatry at the Payne Whitney Institute in New York, Evarts joined NIMH in Bethesda, Maryland where he was appointed as head of the Section on Physiology at the Laboratory of Clinical Science and became chief of the Laboratory of Neurophysiology in 1970. Evarts remained in that position until he died, in his laboratory, July 2, 1985.
Evarts started his neurophysiological research by conducting ablation studies of visual and auditory cortex in monkeys. He also studied effects of LSD and post-tetanic potentiation in the cat visual system. Evarts made his most significant contribution to the field of neuroscience and motor control by pioneering electrophysiological recordings from single cortical neurons in awake monkeys. In his early studies using this technique, he compared sleep and waking states. He then conducted experiments that involved single-unit recordings from sensorimotor cortex in monkeys performing operantly conditioned movements. He observed modulations in the activity of single neurons that reflected movement parameters.
Based on these observations, he developed the concepts of "motor set" and "transcortical reflex". "Psychomotor set" describes neural activity that occurs when a motor action in response to a stimulus ("go-cue") is being prepared. "Transcortical reflex" describes the operation of motor cortex in the way similar to spinal reflexes that influence spinal motoneuron firing.
Influence.
The work of Evarts gave rise to a new field in neuroscience. His followers use single electrodes and electrode arrays temporarily inserted or implanted in the brain to record brain signals during different types of behavioral and cognitive activity and thereby gain knowledge about how the brain works. The knowledge accumulated in this research recently resulted in creation of brain-computer interfaces—electronic devices that sample neuronal activity in the brain, decode its meaning and use decoded information to operate external devices, such as robots.
Prediction in 1956 concerning antipsychotic drugs and life expectancy.
At a meeting in 1956 of the National Academy of Sciences, Evarts contended that antipsychotics such as the then new chlorpromazine would cause short-term benefits to patients, but at the cost of reducing life expectancy.

The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Class 25 is a class of 0-6-0 steam locomotive. They were introduced to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway in 1876 by new locomotive superintendent William Barton Wright and 280 were built in total. Of these, 230 were later converted to saddle tanks by John Aspinall, to become L&YR Class 23.
Ownership changes.
The locomotives passed briefly to the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) in 1922 and then to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923. The LMS gave them the power classification 2F. 
In 1948, the surviving locomotives (23) passed to British Railways (BR), which numbered them 52016-52064 (with gaps).
Withdrawal.
Withdrawals began in 1930 but 23 locomotives survived into British Railways ownership in 1948.
Preservation.
The last engine, BR 52044 (L&YR 957, LMS 12044) was bought for preservation in 1959 and has been based at the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway since 1965. It starred in the film "The Railway Children" as the "Green Dragon". It was out of service from 1975 but was returned to steam in 2001 in its BR guise as 52044 before being painted in its L&YR guise as 957 a few years later. Its boiler certificate expired in early 2013 and is now awaiting overhaul.

Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)

William "Billy" Mitchell is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera "EastEnders", played by Perry Fenwick, who made his first appearance on 2 November 1998. Billy was introduced by producer Matthew Robinson as a guest character facilitating the introduction of Jamie Mitchell to the show. In the storyline, Billy is Jamie's abusive uncle and guardian, and Jamie is taken away from Billy by his relative Phil Mitchell. Billy was brought back to the serial on 2 August 1999 and Fenwick was offered a longer-term contract, Billy becoming a regular character. Billy has been described as a "runt of a man who's a catalyst for trouble". Frequently portrayed as a small-time criminal, Billy is a luckless character who often struggles financially. His most prominent storylines include two failed marriages and having a daughter born with Down's syndrome. Fenwick filmed his 1000th episode on 6 August 2010.
Storylines.
Billy, the former guardian of his nephew Jamie Mitchell (Jack Ryder) moves to Walford after Jamie is taken in by Billy's distant cousin Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) because Billy had been taking out his anger on Jamie, though learns from his mistakes. Billy initially becomes involved in criminal scams with his Phil and Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp). Billy's relatives see him as little more than a lackey, and he is frequently told that he is an embarrassment to the Mitchell name. Billy finds an ally in Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), who uses Billy as an errand boy in numerous criminal activities including drug-dealing, to antagonise the Mitchell brothers. Billy works at Steve's club, E20, and is given a 1% share of the club for his services, but is often torn between his loyalties to Steve and his family.
Billy falls for Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), but she is only interested in his money, and when that runs out, she leaves him. Nevertheless, Billy helps her deal with some mental health issues, leading her to hope for a reconciliation but Billy turns her down as he is in love with Little Mo Morgan (Kacey Ainsworth), his business partner in a cleaning company. Mo is abused by her husband, Trevor (Alex Ferns), and after eventually leaving Trevor, she starts a relationship with Billy; they bond after Billy tells her about his time in a children's home, where he was physically abused by the staff. He proposes to Mo by spelling out 'MARRY ME' on her plate with alphabet spaghetti, and they get engaged. When Trevor hears this, he kidnaps Mo and his baby son, intending for all three of them to die in a fire but Mo and the baby are saved before Trevor is killed in a gas explosion. Billy and Mo marry on Christmas Day, the same day that Jamie dies of severe injuries after being knocked down by a car. Eleven months later, Little Mo is raped by a man she thought was a friend, Graham Foster (Alex McSweeney). Mo later discovers she is pregnant as a result of the assault. Billy presses her to have an abortion, but Mo refuses and leaves Walford to clear her head, returning with baby Freddie, to see Graham convicted of rape. Billy and Little Mo reunite, but Billy confesses that he cannot love Freddie and thinks of Graham whenever he sees him, so the marriage ends.
Billy confronts one of his abusers from the children's home he was placed in as a child, Ernie Johnson (John Junkin), now a pensioner and living in Walford. Billy breaks into Ernie's home to confront him over the abuse, shaming Ernie into moving away. Billy starts a relationship with newcomer Honey Edwards (Emma Barton), whom he manages during her spell as a model. The relationship prospers, despite initial disapproval from Honey's father Jack (Nicky Henson), who takes time to accept Billy. Honey falls pregnant and accepts Billy's marriage proposal. Their wedding is postponed when Honey is hospitalised; they re-schedule but the second ceremony goes awry due to a practical joke played on Billy during his stag night. Billy's aunt Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) then arranges a surprise wedding. Billy and Honey just complete their vows when Honey goes into labour. She delivers a girl, Janet Mitchell, but the Mitchells are devastated to discover she has Down's syndrome. Honey rejects her baby; she goes into depression, contemplating infanticide and demands Janet be put up for adoption. Billy is opposed to this but eventually consents after agonising over the decision. After Janet is taken into foster care, she suffers a health scare and is hospitalised, forcing Honey to acknowledge she loves her baby and Janet is brought home.
Honey falls pregnant again and William is born. His birth is traumatic as Honey goes into labour after being caught in a violent siege; she is assaulted by a member of a football firm lead by Terry Bates (Nicholas Ball). William seems stillborn at first but is resuscitated by medics. Billy and Honey suffer financial problems and their landlady, Manju Patel (Leena Dhingra), decides to evict them. Billy steals charity money to pay the rent and barricades them into the flat but they are evicted at Christmas. They rely on kindness of friends and relatives until the council rehouses them. Desperate for money, Billy takes a job as a getaway driver for Jase Dyer (Stephen Lord), believing they are stealing money from Terry Bates, the leader of the firm responsible for hurting Honey. The job is a set-up, and Terry takes Jase's son Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) hostage in their absence. Assisted by Billy, Jay escapes but Jase is killed by Terry in the ensuing fight. Billy hides in the bathroom, too afraid to help Jase. Not realising this, Jay hails Billy a hero for trying to rescue his father. Billy breaks down and confesses his cowardice to Honey, revealing that he kept some of Jase's money, allegedly to give to now orphaned Jay. Honey is incensed; she threatens to leave Billy but reconsiders on condition he never lies to her again. Billy does lie and keeps some of Jase's money, telling Honey he has donated it to charity. Honey subsequently ends their marriage and takes her children to live with her father, leaving Billy alone and depressed.
Billy visits Jay at his foster home and agrees to foster him, but problems arise when Nick Cotton (John Altman) blackmails Billy, threatening to tell Jay the truth about his cowardice on the night of Jase's death. Unable to meet Nick's demands, Billy is forced to tell Jay the truth instead and Jay reacts in fury. Terry's gang try to stop Billy testifying at the upcoming trial, but despite threats, Billy testifies and Terry is sentenced to life imprisonment for murdering Jase. Billy is subsequently redeemed in the eyes of Jay; however, Jay later begins to idolise Phil, to the virtual exclusion of Billy.
When Billy stops a man from pestering Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) at a club, she brands him a hero and they sleep together. Embarrassed by the fling, Billy insults Jean the following day, ending her hopes for romance. Billy later begins a more serious relationship with Julie Perkins (Cathy Murphy), a fellow resident at the children's home he once lived in. Billy is shocked to discover Julie fell pregnant with his child in their teens, and their son was adopted and is now a grown man. Billy attempts to find his son, Dan Pearce, but is devastated to discover he died of liver failure and that his granddaughter, Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold), is in care. Billy visits Lola and they bond. Lola moves in with her grandparents but proves troublesome, and when Billy continuously overrules Julie's attempts to discipline her, a rift forms and Julie leaves Walford. Lola's announcement that she is pregnant leads to Billy returning to his criminal ways to provide for his great grandchild—stealing from Janine and trading stolen goods and forgeries for Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). Janine eventually discovers and sacks Billy after his deception, but after a change of heart, reinstates him and allows him to keep the items he ordered for Lola's baby. Billy grows tired of Lola's troublesome behavior, after she is given a curfew and electronic tag, and focuses on being an Olympic Torch bearer, which he learnt of several months earlier. Billy successfully carries the torch and witnesses the birth of his great granddaughter, Lexi Billie Pearce. 
Billy and Lola are devastated when Lexi is taken into temporary foster care, as Lola's social worker, Trish Barnes (Tessa Churchard) does not think that they are coping. Lexi's father is revealed as Phil's son, Ben (Joshua Pascoe). This leads Phil into gaining temporary custody of Lexi. Phil is even supportive when Lola runs away with Lexi, and tells her that he is the selfish one for sticking by the three times a week access rules. Billy persuades Phil to let Lexi stay over their flat once or twice a week. He says that he is happy with that, but Trish is still unsure whether Lola should be alone with Lexi. Lola sets up her own business, doing the local's manicures and pedicures, which she seems to enjoy. Her and Billy make an extra special effort to keep their flat a tidy environment, and set the small bedroom up for Lexi for when she returns home. Eventually, Lola is re-awarded custody of Lexi. Billy is over-protective of Lola when she starts a relationship with Peter Beale (Ben Hardy), but eventually becomes friends with him, and realises that he is a good man. Peter even moves into their flat, but moves out to look after his dad when his sister, Lucy (Hetti Bywater) is murdered. However, Peter and Lola continue their relationship. Billy is delighted when Honey returns to the Square with Janet & William, because they wanted to visit their dad.
Creation.
The character Billy Mitchell was introduced by producer Matthew Robinson as a guest character in November 1998, used as part of a storyline to introduce Billy's nephew, Jamie, (Jack Ryder) to the regular cast. In the storyline, Billy was caught being abusive to Jamie and he was subsequently taken in by Billy's cousin Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). The character was only intended to appear for four episodes; however, Perry Fenwick revealed in 2006 that the role was extended by "coincidence and chance": "I was offered four episodes and here I am, about 800 later. [...] Ross Kemp (Grant) said that he was leaving, and there was a gap in the Mitchell family, so they brought me back to do stuff towards his leaving. After that they offered me a year." Billy was reintroduced in 1999, making recurring appearances. He was involved in the leaving storyline of Grant Mitchell in October 1999, before returning later in the year as a regular character.
Development.
Personality.
When Billy was first introduced, he was depicted as a "runt of a man who's a catalyst for trouble." Kate Lock, author of "EastEnders Who's Who", has noted that the character was something of an outcast to the rest of the Mitchell clan, commenting, "none of the other Mitchells likes to think of him as 'family' [..] Billy is held in great contempt by the Mitchell , who regard him as a lower lifeform than a worm".
It has been noted that when Billy was first introduced, he was a "nasty piece of work". However, Billy underwent a personality change circa 2002 and "became good". It was revealed that Bill's nasty streak was a result of him having been abused and bullied while growing up in a children's home.
From then on, Billy was depicted as "clownish and a bit of a loser [...] a born romantic with a kind nature and a big heart". According to actor Perry Fenwick, it is doubtful that he would have continued with the role if Billy had not "mended his wicked ways". Billy was involved in an abuse storyline with his nephew Jamie (Jack Ryder), causing the actor to be "harangued" by strangers in public. In 2006, he commented, "I wouldn't have wanted to stay if Billy had been the way he was at the start. I didn't want to be another Nick Cotton, an out and out baddie, because it leaves you nowhere to go. You need to be a rounded character to fit in with the others. Then you can be a bit naughty, funny sometimes, in love sometimes — it all opens out. I'm proud of the way he's changed. I didn't like doing that nasty stuff. I needed and wanted the job, but I knew what would come with it — you can't go anywhere on this show without people telling you what they think."
Fenwick particularly likes the comedic side to the character. He has said, "I just ask them to keep it light and shade. I LOVE the comedy side of Billy but there's a sad side to him, too. He's like a little lost soul who is always beaten up and knocked down but he never gives up. He reminds me of Norman Wisdom."
Relationships.
Honey Edwards and Down's syndrome.
The character Honey Edwards (Emma Barton) was introduced in November 2005 by the executive producer Kate Harwood, as a love interest for Billy. A relationship between Honey and Billy was quickly developed and, within two months, an upcoming baby had been written into the characters' narratives, with Honey announcing she was pregnant in January 2006. A BBC insider told "The Sun", "Billy is absolutely chuffed to bits".
The pregnancy was the start of an on-going storyline about Down's syndrome (DS) as, in September 2006, Honey and Billy's baby Janet was diagnosed with the disorder shortly after her birth. "EastEnders"' producers began to work on the DS plot in February 2006. Real parents with children who have Down's Syndrome were approached to act as consultants in the making of the storyline, meeting with writers and the actors who play Billy and Honey. On-screen, Honey was shown to be devastated, rejecting her baby and wanting to have her adopted, while Billy wanted to keep his daughter, placing strain on the couple, who married in the serial the day of Janet's birth.
The Down's Syndrome Association (DSA) worked with "EastEnders" on the storyline. Their medical advisers were consulted about possible health problems that Billy and Honey's baby might encounter. According to the DSA in 2006, people with DS are under-represented on mainstream television and "EastEnders" helped to redress that imbalance. The DSA used their influence to change certain elements of the scripts that they were unhappy with, such as persuading them to change the way Billy and Honey were told of their baby's diagnosis; however, they had no influence over the characters' reactions or the plot in general. For the first two weeks after Janet's diagnosis, the DSA provided a helpline for worried parents or anyone wanting advice about DS. "EastEnders" also provided a link to the DSA website from theirs, to ensure that people looking for information could find the association.
The storyline was developed with characterisation in mind. Some characters, such as Peggy Mitchell, were shown to respond negatively towards the baby, views that were included so that the positive aspects could be voiced by the "more enlightened characters". The programme makers' main priority was to show the reality of having a child with the condition, "with all of its positives and negatives" and to "create awareness among thousands of people who know very little about Down's syndrome, who might have out-dated or prejudiced views." "EastEnders" took advice from DS organisations and DS families throughout. Care was taken to ensure that viewers empathised with Billy and Honey, to portray their journey in a "realistic way".
The DSA have expressed their desire to see a character with Down's syndrome becoming a permanent member of the "EastEnders" cast, as in their opinion "it would be a fantastic opportunity to bring Down's syndrome into mainstream awareness, and to present a 21st century picture of family life for those who have children with the condition." In 2006, "EastEnders" pledged that they intended for Billy and Honey's baby to grow up as any other baby would in the soap; however, it has been noted that the plot is dependent on the actors involved, and other practical problems that could arise. "EastEnders" pledged to make every effort to portray "a positive image of a family who have a baby with the condition."
The episodes received criticism for inaccuracy. Sue Jacob, a teacher at the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), said "EastEnders" presented a "poor picture of midwifery practice". During Janet's birth, Honey was refused an epidural while in pain, and later she was told that her baby had Down's syndrome alone, without her partner or family there to support her. Jacob commented, "Women are vulnerable after giving birth and they need support systems in place [...] The person caring for her is repeatedly referred to as a nurse in the episode but there is no way that a nurse would be in charge after birth. The midwife would also have been open and honest and said 'We need to get the baby checked out and we will get your partner' [...] What the soaps do is set scenes which prompt people to talk about things which are affecting their lives. We are concerned people will wrongly think this Down's syndrome story shows what really happens, and that if you have a problem there is no one there to support you. Showing something like this is not helpful." Furthermore, Jacob noted that Honey was left alone for a long time to worry about the baby, which appeared rigid, and not floppy, as babies with DS do. In Jacob's opinion, a midwife would have been repeatedly in and out of the room to check on the mother. Additionally, one episode showed a health visitor reprimanding Honey for refusing Down's syndrome screening and Karen Reay, director of the Community Practitioners' and Health Visitors' Association called the episode "insensitive and patronising". She added that the episode contained "glaring anomalies", giving new mothers a "fictitious and misleading" view of health visitors, which could "damage relationships with health professionals".
The BBC responded by saying, ""EastEnders" has undertaken a great deal of research to script the storyline of Billy and Honey giving birth to their baby daughter. "EastEnders" takes enormous care with its research and takes advice from experts in the given field. In addition, for this particular storyline "EastEnders" talked to numerous families with children who have Down's Syndrome. Some of their experiences were depicted in these early episodes. Also closely involved was a senior midwife from a large UK general hospital who saw all scripts. In relation to some particular points raised, Honey was not denied an epidural — she made the choice to put herself out of reach of communicating effectively with the midwife by locking herself in the bathroom. When the news was broken to Honey and Billy that their baby had Down's Syndrome, "EastEnders" has in fact drawn directly from one particular true-life story — and while this may indeed not be best practice it is worth saying that good drama does not necessarily come from best practice." Despite the BBC's "extensive search" to cast a real Down's baby for the birth episodes, they were unable to do so, resulting in the shots of the newborn baby being less authentic and limited. The BBC added, "In the coming weeks Honey and Billy's child will be played by a baby with Down's Syndrome. It is worth noting that "EastEnders" has received incredibly positive feedback from the Down's Syndrome Association following the first few episodes, whom we are continuing to work with very closely." Carol Boys, chief executive of the Down's Syndrome Association, has confirmed that 40% of parents whose babies were diagnosed after birth were given no written or practical information about the condition, and 11% were told, as Honey was, by a midwife rather than a paediatrician: "The way in which Billy and Honey have learnt of their baby's disability, and their subsequent support from their health professionals, is not a best-practice model. However, neither is it an unrealistic situation. BBC researchers and scriptwriters have based the scenes on conversations with families who have children with Down's Syndrome, and the scenes have struck a chord with thousands of our parent members across the country. Some health professionals hold outdated or prejudiced views about people with Down's Syndrome that prevent them from giving parents a balanced picture of what the future will hold for them."
Julie Perkins.
In 2010, storylines show Billy receiving a letter from the care home he stayed in as a child, and a character from his past, Julie Perkins (Cathy Murphy) arrives in the series. Julie turns Billy's life upside-down and forces him to face some shocking home truths. The storyline was introduced as executive producer Bryan Kirkwood, who took on the role earlier in 2010, wanted Billy to have a storyline that was not connected to existing characters. Fenwick said the storyline was an acting challenge with plenty of twists and turns, and said "it's given me the chance to let go and be a little bit nutty."
In June 2011, it was announced that Danielle Harold had joined the cast, playing Julie and Billy's 15-year-old granddaughter Lola Pearce. It was reported that Billy and Julie would be shocked to learn of Lola's existence, not knowing the son they once gave up for adoption had a daughter, but would decide to track her down and find her living in a care home.
Olympic torch bearing storyline.
In November 2011, Billy is selected to be a torch bearer for the 2012 Summer Olympics. In reality, Fenwick carried the torch through the setting of Albert Square, with live footage shown in the second episode on 23 July 2012. London 2012 chairman Sebastian Coe said: "The announcement is a great addition to the Olympic Torch Relay Route. I'm sure the people of Walford will now start planning their celebrations. Along with people right round the UK, the residents of Albert Square will be getting involved to make this their moment to shine." Fenwick said, "When we first discussed the storyline, my initial thought was that I'll now have to get fit. While this may be a fictional one-off for Billy, it's a real once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me and I am thrilled that Walford and Albert Square will be part of this amazing event."
Reception.
Billy has been described by Nicola Methven, TV editor of "The Mirror", as one of EastEnders' most popular characters. According to actor Perry Fenwick, Billy was initially unpopular with a proportion of viewers for his abusive antics on-screen. In 2006, Fenwick commented, "In the beginning it was all old ladies having a go at me, and young girls who fancied Jack Ryder". However, when the character's personality altered, the reception to his character improved. Fenwick adds, " Now it's great — people really like Billy and shout out: "All right, Billy boy, how's it going?". According to Methven, "The turning point for Billy's popularity came when viewers learned his nasty streak was a result of him having been abused and bullied while growing up in a children's home"
In popular culture and other media.
The character of Billy Mitchell has been spoofed in the cartoon sketch show "2DTV". Billy appears in series 2 of the spin-off series "".

Harwich International railway station

Harwich International is a railway station serving Harwich International Port in Essex, England. The station is located on the electrified Mayflower Line from to Harwich Town. The station is located in and serves the community of Parkeston, and was known as Harwich Parkeston Quay until 1995.
The station has two entrances - one on the ground floor of the passenger terminal building which houses a staffed ticket office and ticket machines, direct access to Platform 1 and indirect access to Platforms 2 and 3 via the footbridge. There is also a second street entrance from the short-stay car park via the footbridge, although this entrance is unstaffed and has no ticketing facilities. The platforms can also be accessed via the level crossing at the east end of the platforms.
Generally speaking, Platform 1 is used for the semi-fast "Dutchflyer" trains to London Liverpool Street as a terminus. Platform 2 is bi-directional and is served by local services between and Harwich Town. Platform 3 is used by the services to and .
History.
The port and station owe their origins to the Great Eastern Railway which opened them on a new track alignment built over reclaimed land in 1883 and named them after its chairman, C.H. Parkes. The original combined station building and hotel is still in existence although the hotel is now offices and part of the port terminal.
Prior to the station's re-development, and its revised layout, it consisted of two through platforms serving the then double track operation to Harwich Town. This was supplemented by a bay platform at the country end of the main platform platform 1 which handled the Harwich to Parkeston 'local' service, which in the days of steam generally consisted of a J15 and later N2 or N7 tank engines and up to four coaches. This service was timed to suit shift times both on the quay and in the adjoining offices, the majority of workers being railway employees. The bay also had a loop allowing the running round of the locomotive. The main platform 1 today was and still is of sufficient length to accommodate a boat train of 10 or 11 coaches. The up through platform was shorter but this did not prevent it being used by the North Country boat train in the morning, which consisted of 11 or 12 coaches and would overhang the end of the platform considerably, but in those days there was no level crossing at the east end of the station. 
The Manningtree to Harwich local service used the last one-third of the main platform using a third central access line, which joined the platform at that point allowing a ticket barrier to be used for that part of the platform exclusively. This arrangement allowed a five- or six-coach train to sit at the western end of that platform without the need for any shifting, whereas a full boat train would have to move temporarily towards the west to allow the local train access.
During the peak years of foot passenger movements through the quay, before the introduction of the roll-on/roll-off ferries and the rationalisation of the ferry services that followed, another station operated at the West end of Parkeston Quay, known as 'Parkeston Quay West'. It consisted of a single platform and was capable of handling a 10- or 11-coach boat train. It serviced the day service to the Hook of Holland and was also used by troop trains during the period when trooping was still a major operation through the port. Its position afforded exactly the same close proximity to the ferry as the main station.
Parkeston Quay was the base port for three troop ships serving the U.K.'s Rhine Army operation in Germany via the Hook of Holland. The vessels employed were "Vienna", "Empire Parkeston" and "Empire Wansbeck".
The extensive marshalling yard to the west of the main station provided stabling for the carriage sets which were used on the boat trains and local services, the large numbers of trucks used for servicing Parkeston Quay, and the huge throughput of export and import wagons which were shipped over the train ferry service from Harwich Town. Cargoes were assembled at Parkeston and brought to Harwich for a specific sailing, as there was no long term storage capacity at the ferry terminal. Import wagons were subject to customs clearance at Parkeston and delays could at times be considerable on individual wagons, cargoes having arrived from various Continental origins.
The type of unit passing through the marshalling yard changed towards the end of the century as container or freightliner flats and car flats replaced ferry wagons. The boat trains also declined as passenger trends changed and today there are no dedicated boat trains except for specials servicing cruise vessels.
Engine Shed.
In the 1870s the building of Parkeston Quay had started and land to the east of that site was allocated for the new engine shed which opened in March 1883. The shed was a four-road brick built straight-shed with an outdoor turntable located between the shed and running lines. Access to the shed was from the Harwich direction and the shed was provided with coaling and watering facilities. In the 1890s the shed was equipped to deal with some repairs although these were generally undertaken at Ipswich engine shed. 
A new larger turntable was provided on the site in 1912 and this was installed in time for the delivery of the 1500 class 4-6-0 locomotives, the first of which was allocated to Parkeston. It is probably about this time that access to the shed was improved with a link from the east end of Parkeston Quay railway station supplementing the exisitng access. 
The shed was part of the Ipswich district (referred to as the Eastern district after 1915).
1923 Allocation.
At the end of the Great Eastern Railway the following locomotives were allocated to Parkeston:
London & North Eastern Railway 1923-1947.
In 1930 improved coal facilities were introduced along with a water softening plant in 1935.
During the Second World War the depot would have dealt with significant traffic for the Royal Navy as Harwich was a base for Destroyers.
British Railways 1948-1967.
In the 1950s Britannia Class locomotives allocated to Stratford engine shed worked the Liverpool boat trains although these were usually worked by Parkeston crews. The Thompson B1 class 4-6-0 class worked many of the other longer distance trains and at the time Parkeston was the port through which many British Army on the Rhine troops passed through with special trains sometimes running in connection with this traffic. 
The shed was re-roofed in 1950. 
By the mid- to late 1950s the number of steam locomotives had declined. Ian Allan's "Locoshed Book" listed just 24 on 11 May 1957, (9 x B1, 9 x J39, 3 x J15, 1 x J68 and 2 x N7). The numbers of shunting and tank engines had been reduced by the arrival of diesel powered units and DMUs had begun to work local services. There were still 33 units allocated overall to the shed in 1959 but by 1967 the facility had been demolished.
The Thompson B1's were well suited to the boat train and fast freight traffics, although much of the motive power for the boat trains was provided by Stratford, including Britannia Pacifics when they became more available after the second large batch of the type had been delivered to the Eastern Region. They were regularly accommodated overnight. 
The demolition of the locomotive shed allowed the construction of the new Freightliner terminal on the site, which opened in May 1968. The 'Seafreightliner' service operated two sailings per day to Zeebrugge and one sailing per day to Rotterdam, the latter in a joint service with its Dutch counterparts.
Inter city trains.
Harwich Parkeston Quay continued to have locomotive hauled inter city services running to both London and the north via Ipswich, Bury St Edmunds, Ely and Peterborough (mostly Manchester and Glasgow). These were mainly hauled by Class 47s to the north (though other classes such as class 45s were also used) and Class 37s and 47s to London though once the Mayflower line was electrified Class 86's replaced the 37s and 47s, but these were in turn replaced by Dutchflyer services. The locomotive hauled services to the north were replaced by diesel multiple units and truncated to Peterborough. 
Historic Passenger Train services.
Boat trains commenced running to Harwich Parkeston Quay in 1882 and were timed and 1 hour 45 minutes from Liverpool Street. By 1895 this was down to 1 hour 30 minutes. In 1897 the 8:30 pm train was run as two separate trains - 8:30 pm for the Hook of Holland and 8:35 pm for Antwerp. With the introduction of the corridor restaurant cars in 1904, the time was eased to 87 minutes, but the introduction of the 1500 Sandringham 4-6-0 express engines in 1912 saw a running time of 82 minutes.
As well as through boat train services to London Liverpool Street and local services to Manningtree and Ipswich the most interesting working was the North Country Continental boat train which operated between Parkeston Quay and various destinations in the north and Midlands. Prior to 1923 the train consisted of various carriages which were detached en route with the main portion going to York.
This train included the first restaurant car on the Great Eastern (in 1891) and this was also the first service in the UK to allow third-class passengers to dine. A new train set was built for this service in 1906 and generally operated in the following formation:
ENGINE+THIRD CLASS BRAKE+CORRIDOR THIRD+OPEN THIRD+KITCHEN AND OPEN FIRST+SEMI-OPEN FIRST+SIX WHEEL BRAKE (this constituted the York section). Then followed various corridor composite brakes followed each detached from the rear of the northbound train en route. These were for LIVERPOOL (detached Doncaster on the outward journey)+ LIVERPOOL + MANCHESTER(detached at Lincoln and routed via the Great Central routes) + BIRMINGHAM (via Midland Railway routes) + BIRMINGHAM (via London and North Western routes)(both of which were detached at March).
2013 passenger services.
In 2013 the service on the 'Mayflower Line' sees an hourly train for most of the week, although a few extra services run during the morning and evening peak Monday to Friday. They operate between Manningtree and Harwich Town calling at all stations, although a few trains are extended to and from Colchester and/or . Additionally, there are services from London and a service from north of in connection with ferry services.

Kang Sang-jung

Kang Sang-jung (Hangul: 강상중, Hanja: 姜尙中; Japanese name - which Kang used until his undergraduate days - Nagano Tetsuo (永野鉄男) 1950) is a second-generation Zainichi Korean political scientist, writer and public commentator. He has been an academic at several Japanese universities including the University of Tokyo (1996-2013), and is currently President of Seigakuin University.
Biography.
The third son of a Korean migrant from the Masan area of Korea, Kang was born and grew up in Kumamoto in Kyūshū. He has described his childhood experiences in his autobiography "Zainichi", published in 1994.
After studying at Waseda University, he was an exchange student at the University of Nurnberg, Erlangen in the then West Germany. His encounters with the families of migrant workers in Germany had a lasting influence on his understanding of Zainichi Korean identity.
After returning to Japan, he was involved in the protest movement against the compulsory fingerprinting of foreign residents in the early 1980s. He lectured at Meiji Gakuin University and International Christian University in Tokyo, before being appointed to the University of Tokyo. In 2013 he retired from the University of Tokyo to take up the position of University Professor at Seigakuin University in Saitama Prefecture, near Tokyo.
Kang's early work focused on the political and social thought of Max Weber. He has written extensively on the subject of Zainichi Korean identity, nationalism and its problems, and the relationship between Japan and North Korea. He is also an enthusiastic proponent of Northeast Asian regional integration.
Within the Japanese linguistic sphere, he is one of the most outspoken critics of Japanese Nationalism and United States Imperialism. Related to this, he has been characterized in some right-wing Japanese magazines as being a "supporter" of North Korea. Kang himself, however, vigorously contests this, pointing out that his writings have consistently criticized dictatorships, both Right-wing and Left-wing.
His other major works include "Beyond Orientalism" (Iwanami, 1996), "The Perspective of Globalization" (Iwanami, 2001, co-authored with Yoshimi Shunya), and "Nationalism" (Iwanami, 2001).
Kang is widely known as a media commentator in Japan, and has presented a number of TV documentary programs on issues including contemporary Korean society and the problems of nuclear power. His recent writings include two major bestsellers - "Nayamu Chikara" ("Thee Power of Disquiet", Shueisha 2008) and "Kokoro" ("Heart", Shueisha 2013). The second, a novel centred on the events of the 11 March 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident, is a profound reflection on the human response to death, and on the search for meaning in the face of suffering and loss.

The Rolladen-Schneider LSD Ornith is the first two-seater sailplane to have been built from plastic composites. The single exemplar was designed by Wolf Lemke and Karl Pummer and first flew in May 1972, a few weeks before the SB-10. As far as possible, components from the serially-produced LS1 sailplane were used, including the fuselage forms. This resulted in a cramped cockpit, where the pedals of the rear seat are almost upon the front seat control stick. The two-piece canopy extends back up to the wing spar. The undercarriage comprises fixed wheel and tailskid. The very large rudder is quite striking. The wings were extended at the root by approximately one and a half metres, yielding a span of eighteen metres, with two degrees of negative sweep. Schempp Hirth airbrakes sprout from the wing upper surfaces. Separate actions for the nose-hook and centre of gravity hook are the only control oddity in this pleasant-flying design. The empty weight of only 287 kg is remarkably light for a double-seater.
The Ornith achieved some notable gliding records flying from Switzerland and South Africa. Today it is based at Aschaffenburg Airfield (EDFC) in Germany.

Brother and Sister

Brother and Sister is a well-known European fairy tale which was, among others, written down by the Brothers Grimm in their collection of "Children's and Household Tales (Grimm's Fairy Tales)". It is alternatively known as Little Sister and Little Brother or (in the Grimm's version) "Brüderchen und Schwesterchen".
Plot synopsis.
Tired of the cruel mistreatment they endured from their wicked stepmother, who was also a witch, a brother and sister ran away from home one day. They wandered off into the countryside and spent the night in the woods. When the next morning came, the boy was thirsty and they went on the lookout for a spring of clear water. Their stepmother had already discovered their escape however, and bewitched all the springs in the forest. He was about to drink from one, when his sister heard how its rushing sound said "Whoever drinks from me will become a tiger."
Desperately, the girl begged her brother not to drink from the spring, lest he transform into a tiger and tear her to pieces. So they went back on their way, but when they came to the second spring the girl heard it say, "Whoever drinks from me will become a wolf." Again, she desperately tried to prevent her brother from drinking from it. Reluctantly, he eventually agreed to her pleas but insisted he would drink from the next spring they encountered. And so they arrived at the third spring, and the girl overheard the rushing water cry, "Whoever drinks from me will become a deer." But it was too late, because her brother had already drank from it, and changed into a deer.
As the initial feeling of despair cleared up, the children decided to stay and live in the woods forever. The girl would take care of her brother, and tied her gold chain around his neck. They went to live in a little house deep within the woods and lived there happily for some years, until they were disturbed one day by a hunting party and the King himself who had followed the strange deer home. Upon seeing the beautiful girl, he immediately asked her to marry him and she accepted. Thus she became Queen and they all went to live happily in the King's castle. Time passed and the Queen gave birth to a son.
Their stepmother however soon discovered that they were still alive and plotted against them. One night, she killed the Queen and replaced her with her own disfigured daughter (whom she had transformed to resemble her). When the Queen's ghost secretly visited her baby's bedside for three consecutive nights however, the King caught on and her stepmother's evil plan was exposed.
The Queen came back to life and her stepfamily was tried for their crimes. The daughter was banished into the woods where she was torn to pieces by wild animals and her mother was burned at the stake. At the exact moment of her death, the boy became human again and at long last, the family was reunited. They all lived happily ever after.
Origins.
The first recorded appearance of "Brother and Sister" is in Giambattista Basile's "Pentamerone" around the 17th century. It was written down as the tale of "Ninnillo and Nennella." Since then it has circulated in a number of European countries under varying titles but with most of the main story intact. In Russia the story was more commonly known as "Sister Alionushka, Brother Ivanushka" and collected by Alexander Afanasyev in "Narodnye russkie skazki". In the Aarne-Thompson classification system of fairy tales, "Brother and Sister" is categorized as its own type as number 450, "the brother and sister". Another of this type is "The Lambkin and the Little Fish".
At times, "Brother and Sister" has been confused with "Hansel and Gretel". "Hansel and Gretel" has been known as "Little Brother and Little Sister" which is also an alternate title for this tale. The Grimms selected "Hansel and Gretel" for the tale by that name and kept the "Brother and Sister" title for this tale. Some publications of the "Hansel and Gretel" tale still use the "Little Brother and Little Sister title", causing confusion for readers.
The story as the Grimm's told it was first published in the original 1812 edition of their Children's and Household Tales, and subsequently featured in all later editions, with several additions in 1819. Also, Nippon Animation Company of Japan featured the story in one episode of season two of its anime TV series, "Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics".
Analysis.
This tale, like "The Twelve Brothers", "The Seven Ravens", and "The Six Swans", features a woman rescuing her brothers. In the era and region in which it was collected, many men were drafted by kings for soldiers, to be sent as mercenaries. As a consequence, many men made their daughter their heirs; however, they also exerted more control over them and their marriages as a consequence. The stories have been interpreted as a wish by women for the return of their brothers, freeing them from this control. However, the issues of when the stories were collected are unclear, and stories of this type have been found in many other cultures, where this issue can not have inspired them.
Modern psycho-analysis interprets the relation between brother and sister in this story as a metaphor for the animalistic and spiritual duality in humans. The brother represents the instinctive and the sister the rational side. As "Brother and Sister" opens, the two children are still in their youth and clearly in conflict over each other's choices. The brother cannot control his impulse to drink from the wellspring and is subsequently "punished" by being turned into a deer. Note then the symbolical gesture with which the girl ties her gold chain around her brother's neck, as if to suggest the taming of the animalistic side. Following is a period of relative happiness in which the two sides live in harmony with each other. In this context, "Brother and Sister" could be viewed as a veiled coming of age tale. It's interesting to observe then that in this story the animalistic side is associated with the male and the spiritual/rational side with the female.
It has also been interpreted for messages about family fidelity through adversity and separation. Contemporary literary works that draw upon this fairy tale and its analytical themes include "In the Night Country," a story by Ellen Steiber, "Brother and Sister," a poem by Terri Windling, and "Sister and Brother," a poem by Barth Anderson.

<doc id="2878959" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2878959" title="Joementum">
Joementum

Joementum is a portmanteau of "Joe" and "momentum". The word was originally coined by 2004 Democratic Presidential candidate Senator Joseph Lieberman, who, shortly before coming in a disappointing fifth in the New Hampshire 2004 Democratic primary, insisted that his campaign was "picking up Joementum." His finish in the primary was later declared to be part of a "three-way split decision for third place."
Since then, the term has become popular among some bloggers as a satirical reference to both Lieberman himself and his election efforts, usually referring to the perceived lack of potential for success of a campaign or endeavor. If a candidate is failing to advance in the polls, they are said to be suffering from "Joementum.", as Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks used the term in 2008 to describe Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. The term has not been used by Lieberman himself in the aftermath of his 2004 primary campaign.
The term briefly regained non-ironic popularity during Lieberman's successful run as an independent candidate in the 2006 Senate election in Connecticut, after having lost in the Democratic primary to Ned Lamont.

Australian Geographic

The Australian Geographic is a bi-monthly geographical magazine-style journal created by Dick Smith in 1986. It focuses mainly on stories about Australia, or about Australian people in other countries. The six editions published each year are available by subscription and on newsstands.
The magazine is known for the poster included in each edition as well as the high-quality photographs, the excellent maps from award-winning cartographers and the detailed technical illustrations. The 10th anniversary edition featured one of the country's most comprehensive maps of exploration ever produced. These maps have been used by explorers crossing Central Australia and Antarctica.
Australian Geographic has a comprehensive website which includes the entire magazine digital archive.
It was published by Australian Geographic, a privately owned organisation that also managed a chain of retail stores similarly named in Australia. Each year, a portion of the profits is given to the Australian Geographic Society, the non-profit arm of "Australian Geographic" which supports scientific research as well as environmental and community projects. Funds are also used to highlight and support Australian adventurers and produce related diaries, calendars and books. There are also 70 Australian Geographic retail stores which sell products including Australiana, weather stations, telescopes, books and toys, these are now owned and run separately to the magazine publication.
History.
The publication's offices were originally based in Terrey Hills north of Sydney. Smith was advised to include his name on the cover to aid the journal's establishment. After two years he removed his name from the cover. Smith wanted the publication to focus on accuracy by exclusively including articles that were peer-reviewed. In 1995, when subscriptions totalled more than 200,000, the publication was sold to Fairfax.
From September 2000 to December 2001, Australian Geographic published a bimonthly science and technology magazine known as "Newton Graphic Science". There were, however, only eight issues published before the magazine went permanently out of print. In 2001 the journal's offices were threatened by fires during the Black Christmas bushfires.
ACP Magazines (now Bauer Media Group) purchased "Australian Geographic" in 2006; today the journal is based at Park Street Sydney. Dick Smith no longer has direct editorial control over content found in the journal, but remains as chairman of trustees of the Australian Geographic Society. The current editor-in-chief of Australian Geographic is Chrissie Goldrick.
Awards.
The Australian Geographic Society Adventure Award is Australia's longest-running award for adventure. It has been in operation since 1987, and is bestowed upon Australia's most respected adventurers. The award is judged on merit; therefore, not all of the categories are awarded annually. The society bestows awards as a celebration of achievement and not as a competition, as such. The award is given in two categories - Adventurer of the Year, and Young Adventurer of the Year.

Arrington Dixon

Arrington Dixon is an African American former city council member of Washington, D.C. In 2008, he was D.C.'s male representative on the Democratic National Committee and a thus a superdelegate to the Democratic National Convention. He ran for reelection as national committeeman in the September 2008 Democratic primary but was defeated by Vincent Orange, 56 to 44 percent.
He was also appointed by Mayor Barry to serve as a public member of the National Capital Planning Commission. He was married to former D.C. mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly before she served as mayor (1991–1995).
Council of the District of Columbia.
In November 1974, Dixon was chosen to represent Ward 4 when voters elected the first members of the Council of the District of Columbia, the legislature of the city's new home rule government. The initial term for the Ward 4 seat, like those for half the council seats, was only 2 years, to provide for staggered council elections in later years, but in 1976 Dixon was reelected to a full 4-year term.
In 1978, council chairman Sterling Tucker ran for mayor rather than seeking reelection. Dixon, who was halfway through his Ward 4 term, decided to run for council chairman and won. He served 4 years. In 1982 he ran for reelection but was defeated in the Democratic primary by David A. Clarke.
More than a decade later, Dixon returned to the council as an at-large member for a few months in 1997 when he was chosen in August by the District of Columbia Democratic State Committee to replace Linda Cropp, who had vacated her at-large seat to become chairman. The appointment lasted only until a December special election, in which he was defeated by then-Republican David Catania.

New York State Canal Corporation

The New York State Canal Corporation is a subsidiary of the New York State Thruway Authority. It is responsible for the oversight, administration and maintenance of the New York State Canal System, which consists of the Erie Canal, Cayuga–Seneca Canal, Oswego Canal and Champlain Canal. It is also involved with the development and maintenance of the New York State Canalway Trail and with the general development and promotion of the Erie Canal Corridor as both a tourist attraction and a working waterway.
In 2004, it was discovered that officials of the Canal Corporation had attempted to sell private development rights to large stretches of the Old Erie Canal to a single developer for a mere $30,000, far less than the land was worth on the open market. After an investigation by the Syracuse Post-Standard newspaper and much public criticism, governor George Pataki later canceled the deal. 
The current director of the New York State Canal Corporation is Brian Stratton, who was appointed to the position by Governor Andrew Cuomo in the Spring of 2011. 
In May 2006, Governor Pataki proposed recreating the Canal Corporation by 2010 as an independent agency no longer under the oversight of the Thruway Authority.

Troy Tulowitzki

Troy Trevor Tulowitzki (born October 10, 1984), is an American professional baseball shortstop with the Colorado Rockies of Major League Baseball.
Tulowitzki's arm, range and instincts at shortstop are highly regarded. Furthermore, his size, ability and leadership skills have garnered him comparisons to Cal Ripken, Jr., Alex Rodriguez and Derek Jeter.
High school career.
Tulowitzki graduated from Fremont High School in Sunnyvale, California, alma mater of former Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth. He earned four varsity letters in baseball and two in basketball. He was twice named second team All-State in baseball, and was a 3-time team MVP. As a junior, Tulowitzki had a batting average of .536. He also went 15–1 on the mound. As a senior, he batted .519 with 6 home runs. In basketball, Tulowitzki won league MVP, and was second team All-State and team MVP, averaging 22.6 points per game during his senior year. He was named Fremont High Athlete of the Year in 2002.
Long Beach State.
A sure-handed starting shortstop for three seasons at California State University, Long Beach, Tulowitzki had a .962 career fielding percentage. Offensively, in 155 career games, he had a batting average of .310, with 20 homers, 117 RBIs, 37 doubles, and a .491 slugging percentage. He also accumulated 31 multi-hit games in his collegiate career. "Baseball America" rated him as having the top arm and as the best defensive shortstop in the Big West Conference. Tulowitzki was a two-time All-Big West selection (second team in 2003 and first team in 2004) and a two-time All-Regional Tournament selection, earning Most Outstanding Player (MOP) honors in 2004. In 2004 he was selected for the United States collegiate national team and helped lead Team USA to a gold medal in the World University Baseball Championship. He was drafted by the Colorado Rockies, with the seventh overall pick in the first round of the 2005 Major League Baseball Draft.
Major leagues.
Colorado Rockies (2006-present).
2006 season.
Tulowitzki made his Major League Baseball debut with the Rockies on August 30, 2006, against the New York Mets. He had four at-bats and went hitless with three strikeouts. Tulowitzki made it to the big leagues after playing just 126 minor league games. He collected his first Major League hit, an infield single off Óliver Pérez of the Mets, on August 31. Tulowitzki hit his first MLB home run on September 4, off Woody Williams of the San Diego Padres, in a 7–5 loss. He posted a .240 batting average with one home run and six RBIs in 25 games during the 2006 season.
2007 season.
Tulowitzki entered spring training prior to the 2007 season in a battle with incumbent Rockies shortstop Clint Barmes for the starting role. After a spring that saw Tulowitzki win the spring training's MVP award, along with Barmes struggling offensively, Tulowitzki entered 2007 as the Rockies' starting shortstop.
As a rookie, Tulowitzki established himself in the eyes of some as a Gold Glove-caliber shortstop. He led all MLB shortstops in fielding percentage (.987), putouts (262), total chances (834), assists (561), and double plays turned (114; 2 more than Jack Wilson, in 233 more innings). He also ranked first in range factor (5.39) and second in zone rating (.866). His target at first base, 3-time gold glover Todd Helton, led the National League in fielding percentage (.999; for the second straight year) and range factor (10.39). Tulowitzki's .987 fielding percentage set an MLB-single season record by a rookie shortstop. He was also a major contributor in the Rockies' MLB-record .98925 fielding percentage for one season.
Tulowitzki ended up not winning the 2007 National League Gold Glove Award, which is voted on by NL coaches and players. The award went instead to Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Jimmy Rollins, despite the fact that Tulowitzki had a better fielding percentage (.987 to .985), zone rating, and range factor, and more total chances, putouts, and assists, and turned 4 more double plays, in 66.1 fewer innings, than Rollins. They each had 11 errors, but Tulowitzki's came on 834 total chances, compared to Rollins' 717.
Tulowitzki did, however, win the Fielding Bible Award at shortstop, which is awarded to the shortstop who a panel of voters view as the best defensive shortstop in Major League Baseball. The panel consists of national sports writers, scouts and sports radio talk show hosts.
On April 29, 2007, Tulowitzki turned just the 13th unassisted triple play in MLB history, during a 9–7 home victory at Coors Field over the Atlanta Braves. As of 2009, eight of the 15 unassisted triple plays have been made by a shortstop. In the top of the seventh, Tulowitzki caught third baseman Chipper Jones' line drive with the runners moving, then stepped on second base to retire Kelly Johnson and tagged Edgar Rentería - who made no attempt to escape - before he could return to first base. Confused and not realizing what he had done, Tulowitzki went back and tagged second again, then threw the ball to Helton at first, neither of which was necessary.
Instead of giving the historic triple play ball back to Tulowitzki, Helton accidentally tossed it into the crowd. However, the ball was eventually retrieved and returned to Tulowitzki a couple of weeks later.
On September 12, 2007, against the Philadelphia Phillies, Tulowitzki was on the wrong end of a triple play this time. As he put it, "I was on first base, I thought the ball hit the ground. I was running to second to break it up. Oh, well. I don't know too many people who can say they turned a triple play and had a triple play turned on them in the same year."
On September 10, 2007, Tulowitzki hit his 20th home run of the season, which set the record for most home runs in a single season by a National League rookie shortstop. The previous record was 19, held by Ernie Banks. Tulowitzki hit his first career grand slam on September 29, 2007, in an 11–1 home win over the Arizona Diamondbacks, off of Dustin Nippert. He ended with 24 home runs on the season.
Tulowitzki was named the NL Rookie of the Month for August.
In the 2007 season, Tulowitzki ranked first among NL rookies in at bats (609), plate appearances (678), games (155), hits (177), doubles (33), runs (104), total bases (292), walks (57) and RBIs (99; 2 ahead of Ryan Braun, in 158 more at bats). Tulowitzki's 99 RBIs led all National League shortstops (he was 3 short of a tie for the MLB lead, held by Detroit Tigers shortstop Carlos Guillén). His RBI total set an MLB-single season record for a rookie shortstop. He finished second behind Braun in OBP (.359). He was third behind Braun and Hunter Pence in batting average (.291), slugging percentage (.479), OPS (.838) and triples (5). Tulowitzki was also third behind Braun and Chris Young in home runs (24) and extra base hits (62), and tied for ninth in stolen bases (7).
Tulowitzki tied Young, Rajai Davis and Norris Hopper for the lead among all NL rookies in caught stealing (6), was second to Carlos Ruiz in grounding into double plays (14, which was one more – with 158 more at bats – than third place Braun) and second behind Young in strikeouts (130; leading all NL shortstops). However, Tulowitzki had the third lowest strikeout ratio (21.3%) out of all rookies with at least 400 at-bats, behind Kevin Kouzmanoff (19.4%) and Pence (20.8%). He batted .320 with a .554 slugging percentage and 15 home runs at mile-high Coors Field, but hit only .256 with a .393 slugging percentage and 9 home runs in away games. However, it should be noted that one of the reasons for any substantial differences in home and road splits for Rockies batters is that they have to make adjustments in how they see pitches away from Coors Field – particularly breaking balls, such as sliders and curve balls – since those pitches act differently at Coors Field than on the road.
Team veterans alerted Tulowitzki every time Braun, his chief rival for rookie of the year honors, hit a home run.
Tulowitzki had a 10.8 WARP3 for the season (WARP3 is a metric that measures offensive and defensive production). By comparison, Tulowitzki's rookie of the year rival, Braun, only had a 4.8 WARP3 rating.
Tulowitzki came in second in the race for National League Rookie of the Year. The award was voted on by 32 members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, two from each National League city. Braun beat Tulowitzki, 128 points to 126 points, which was the closest voting in the NL since the current system was adopted in 1980. Tulowitzki also lost to Braun in the vote for the 2007 NL Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award, which was voted on by 488 major league players and 30 managers. Furthermore, he lost out to Braun in the competition for the 2007 Baseball America Rookie of the Year Award, in the vote for the 2007 Players Choice NL Most Outstanding Rookie by their fellow major league players, and in the Baseball Prospectus 2007 Internet Baseball NL Rookie of the Year Award, with 487 first place votes, versus 666 for Braun. However, on December 14, fans voted Tulowitzki the "This Year in Baseball" Rookie of the Year, with 27.6% of the vote, which was ahead of Boston Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia (26.3%) and Braun (22.3%).
Tulowitzki was selected to the 2007 Topps Major League Rookie All-Star Team. The selection was the result of the 49th annual Topps balloting by Major League managers.
On October 1, 2007, in a one-game tie-breaker against the San Diego Padres, Tulowitzki went 4–7 with 3 extra-base hits and scored the tying run in the bottom of the 13th inning. The Rockies won the game, 9–8, and entered the playoffs as the NL wild card team. They faced the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League Division Series. On October 4, 2007, in the second game of the series, Tulowitzki and left fielder Matt Holliday hit back-to-back first-pitch homers in the first inning to begin a 10–5 win, and the Rockies headed to Denver with a 2–0 lead in the series. The Rockies went on to complete a three-game sweep of the Phillies, and advanced to the National League Championship Series, in which they swept the Arizona Diamondbacks in four games. Colorado then played the Boston Red Sox in the World Series, which was the first ever World Series appearance in Rockies history. Boston swept Colorado in four games.
Tulowitzki batted .195 in the postseason, with a .267 on-base percentage and 15 strikeouts in 41 at-bats. Fox Sports writer Chadd Finn stated that while the World Series was the first time that he thought Tulowitzki looked like a rookie all season, he feels Tulowitzki will be better for the experience.
At the same time, MLB Hall of Fame shortstop and third baseman Cal Ripken, Jr. offered his own assessment of Tulowitzki: "He has a strong offensive game, but defensively, he's unbelievable. He really thinks about the position, all aspects of the game. I love that about him."
2008 season.
On January 23, 2008, Tulowitzki signed a six-year, $31-million contract extension with the Rockies. The deal, which also included a club option for 2014, was the largest-ever contract for a player with less than two years experience until Ryan Braun signed an eight-year, $45-million contract extension with the Brewers on May 15, 2008.
On April 29, 2008, in a 3–2 road win over the San Francisco Giants, Tulowitzki tore a left quadriceps tendon during a defensive play in the first inning. He wasn't originally in the starting lineup for the game; however, he was put in at the last minute after utility player Jeff Baker broke a blood vessel in his throwing hand during pregame warmups. On June 11, Tulowitzki played his first rehab game since the injury, as he started at shortstop in a minor league game for the Modesto Nuts – a high-A affiliate of the Colorado Rockies. He returned to the Rockies, starting at shortstop, on June 20, in a 7–2 home loss against the New York Mets. Tulowitzki went hitless in four at-bats and committed no fielding errors in the game. Colorado optioned second baseman Doug Bernier (who made his MLB debut with the team on June 17) to Triple-A before the game in order to open a roster spot for Tulowitzki.
On July 5, 2008, Tulowitzki went back on the disabled list after cutting his right palm in the previous day's 18–17 home win over the Florida Marlins. The injury occurred in the bottom of the seventh inning when Tulowitzki slammed a maple bat into the ground in frustration. The incident took place after he was taken out of the game in that same inning; however, he noted that the frustration leading up to his injury wasn't due to being taken out, saying, "I was a little bit frustrated, not at the move. If anything, I thought it was the right move. I came in the hallway, grabbed a bat, hit it on the ground and the bat exploded in my hand and cut open my palm running up to my index finger." The cut required 16 stitches, but no damage was done to any tendons or nerves. Tulowitzki returned to the Rockies lineup, starting at shortstop, on July 21, 2008, in a 16–10 home loss against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He recorded a career-high five hits during the game, as he went 5-for-5 with one RBI. Also since returning from July 21 he has had 6 multi-hit games in his past 8 games (updated through July 29). During the season in games prior to July 21, Tulowitzki only had six multi-hit games (38 games played, prior to July 21). Tulowitzki ended the 2008 season with a .263 AVG, 8 home runs and 46 RBIs in 101 games.
2009 season.
On August 10, 2009, Tulowitzki hit for the cycle as part of an 11–5 home win over the Chicago Cubs. He also had a career-high seven RBI, which tied for the third-most RBI in MLB history in a game for a player who hit for the cycle. Tulowitzki became the fifth Rockies player to hit for the cycle. He also was the second player in MLB history to hit for the cycle and record an unassisted triple play in a career. Tulowitzki hit a career-high 32 home runs during the season and had a .552 slugging percentage, both of which led all MLB shortstops. He was second in RBI (92), triples (9), walks (73) and on-base plus slugging percentage (.930). He finished fifth in voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America for National League MVP.
2010 season.
On June 17, 2010, Tulowitzki fractured his wrist after being hit by a pitch from Minnesota Twins reliever Alex Burnett. Tulowitzki was placed on the disabled list the following day.
On July 4, 2010, Tulowitzki was one of two Rockies, along with starting pitcher Ubaldo Jiménez, selected as a National League All-Star to play in the 2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Angel Stadium of Anaheim. It was Tulowitzki's first All-Star appearance, but due to being on the disabled list since June 18 with a fractured wrist, he was replaced by New York Mets shortstop José Reyes. In September, Tulowitzki hit 14 home runs from September 3 through the 18th, garnering him back-to-back NL Player of the Week honors for September 6–12 and 13–19. He also earned his first National League Player of the Month award for his efforts during the month of September, in which he led all MLB players with 15 home runs, 40 RBI, 30 runs scored and an .800 slugging percentage. Only Babe Ruth had just as many or more home runs (17) and RBI (43) during that month in MLB history.
Tulowitzki finished the 2010 season leading all MLB shortstops in home runs (27), RBI (95), batting average (.315), on-base percentage (.381), slugging percentage (.568) and on-base plus slugging percentage (.949). He placed fifth in voting for National League MVP for the second consecutive season. Tulowitzki picked up his first Silver Slugger Award for his offensive prowess. On the defensive side, he had the best fielding percentage (.984) and range factor (5.06) among all shortstops in the National League. He earned his second Fielding Bible Award and first Gold Glove at shortstop. He was also ESPN's 2010 Web Gem champion.
On November 29, 2010, Tulowitzki agreed to sign a six-year extension on top of the three years, with a fourth option year, remaining on his contract. The contract will keep Tulowitzki a member of the Rockies' organization through the 2020 season. The six-year extension was worth around $120 million, making it the second-largest contract ever signed by a Rockies player (behind Todd Helton's nine-year $141.5 million contract).
2011 season.
Tulowitzki's walk-up music to begin the season was Katy Perry's "Firework", which was chosen by fans in an online poll. However, he switched to Justin Bieber's "Baby" (another selection on the poll) after starting out in a 0–8 slump. Tulowitzki was elected by his fellow players as a National League reserve for the 2011 All-Star Game in Phoenix, Arizona, but after an injury to starter José Reyes (who was chosen by fans), Tulowitzki became the NL's starting shortstop. He had one hit during the game, which was a single.
Tulowitzki won his second consecutive (third overall) Fielding Bible Award, as the best fielding shortstop in MLB. He also received his second consecutive Gold Glove and Silver Slugger Award.
2012 season.
On April 1, 2012, during a spring training game against the Cleveland Indians, Tulowitzki was hit by a pitch on the arm by former teammate Ubaldo Jiménez. Both Tulowitzki and Jiménez came close to each other while the benches cleared. Jiménez received a five-game suspension and an undisclosed fine.
As the season progressed, Tulowitzki required surgery on his left groin that would leave him unavailable for all of the 2012 campaign. The injury happened on May 30, during a doubleheader with the Houston Astros. It started to appear that Tulowitzki would be able to return before the season came to a close, but it would not be the case. 
The injury limited his numbers to a .287 BA, 27 RBIs, and 8 HR in 47 games.
2013 season.
On June 13, Tulowitzki suffered a fractured right rib in a 5-4 loss to the Nationals. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list and missed 25 games. Despite the injury, Tulowitzki was selected for the 2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Teammates Carlos González and Michael Cuddyer were also selected, and all three players were in the starting lineup for the National League.
2014 season.
Tulowitzki started 2014 by batting .364 in April with 7 home runs, 9 doubles, and 22 RBI. His hot start earned him the NL Player of the Month honors for April. On May 3, Tulowitzki singled for his 1,000th career hit in a game against the New York Mets.
Personal.
Tulowitzki was born in Santa Clara, California.
Tulowitzki's favorite players growing up were Nomar Garciaparra and Derek Jeter. Tulowitzki's jersey number in college was No. 5, due to his admiration of Garciaparra. His Rockies jersey number is No. 2, due to his admiration of Jeter.
The fans at Coors Field participate in a chant for Tulowitzki by clapping nine times and shouting, "Tulo!" after clapping. This chant is performed during most of Tulowitzki's at-bats.
Tulowitzki is of Polish descent.
Tulowitzki has a sister, Tiffany, who plays softball and a brother, Tyler, who plays baseball for San Francisco State University.
In a television interview with ESPN, Tulowitzki stated that his favorite team growing up was the Oakland Athletics and that his favorite musical artist is Jay-Z.

The K Chronicles

The K Chronicles is an autobiographical comic strip by the independent cartoonist Keith Knight. Until February 2010 it was updated every Wednesday at Salon.com. The strip previously appeared in the "San Francisco Examiner".
Knight is an African-American artist who lives in Los Angeles. His comics often explore themes relevant to his racial heritage, as well as current events, both personal to Knight and general to the world.
Recurring characters.
"Keith "Keef" Knight" - The cartoonist and protagonist. The strip centers mainly around his life.
"Kerstin Konietzka-Knight" - Keith's German-born wife.
"George W. Bush" - Keith has mercilessly lampooned the President of the United States and his administration since the 2000 election. In many strips, Bush is shown as a child, or having the mind of one, as shown by his tiny size and frequent childish giggling.
"Dick Cheney" - In contrast to Bush, Vice President Cheney appears in the strip as a sort of evil mastermind (for example, after the real-life shooting of Harry Whittington, Cheney appears and after hearing a witness say that what he did was illegal, boasts that he has already done so many illegal things, such as fixing the election, without being punished, that he is confident that he will escape penalty again). He also makes an appearance in an installment entitled "People Who Can't Be Trusted", where he is placed on the list along with people who put cats on leashes, people who have never seen "The Simpsons", and others.
"God" - Depicted in "The K Chronicles" as a small rodent. In one "K Chronicles Collection", "The Passion of the Keef", God appears to deliver the introduction, in which he reveals that "The K Chronicles" are among his favorite reading material. He also shows up at other times in the strip, such as to visit and hang out with Keith.
"Evil Twin" - Keith's twin sister.
"Gunther" - Ex-roommate and drinking buddy.
Special features.
"Life's Little Victories" - A frequently occurring feature of "The K Chronicles" in which Keith lists the small victories of everyday life, such as "Running into a movie theater and making sitting down just as the lights are fading", or "Having just enough ingredients to make a fresh bowl of guacamole!" Sometimes the feature has a special theme, such as the "foreign version" which takes place when Keith is visiting his in-laws in Germany, and the "on crutches" version, taking place when Keith was on crutches for two months after tearing his Achilles' tendon.

Vantage-point tree

A vantage-point tree, or VP tree is a BSP tree that segregates data in a metric space by choosing a position in the space (the "vantage point") and dividing the data points into two partitions: those that are nearer to the vantage point than a threshold, and those that are not. By repeatedly applying this procedure to partition the data into smaller and smaller sets, a tree data structure is created where neighbors in the tree are likely to be neighbors in the space.
Peter Yianilos claimed that 
the VP-tree was discovered independently by him (Peter Yianilos)
and by Jeffrey Uhlmann.
Yet, Uhlmann published this method before Yianilos in 1991.
Uhlmann called the data structure a metric tree, the name VP-tree was
proposed by Yianiolos.
This iterative partitioning process is similar to that of a "k"-d tree, but uses circular (or spherical, hyperspherical, etc.) rather than rectilinear partitions. In 2D Euclidean space, this can be visualized as a series of circles segregating the data.
The VP tree is particularly useful in dividing data in a non-standard metric space into a BSP tree.
Understanding a VP tree.
The way a VP tree stores data can be represented by a circle. First, understand that each node of this tree contains an input point and a radius. All the left children of a given node are the points inside the circle and all the right children of a given node are outside of the circle. The tree itself does not need to know any other information about what is being stored. All it needs is the distance function that satisfies the properties of the metric space.
Just imagine a circle with a radius. The left children are all located inside the circle and the right children are located outside the circle.
Searching through a VP tree.
Suppose there is a need to find the two nearest targets from a given point (The point will be placed relatively close to distance). Since there are no points yet, it is assumed that the middle point (center) is the closest target. Now a variable is needed to keep track of the distance X (This will change if another distance is greater). To determine whether we go to left or right child will depend on the given point. If the point is closer to the radius than the outer shell, search the left child. Otherwise, search the right child. Once the point (the neighbor) is found, the variable will be updated because the distance has increased.
From here, all the points within the radius have been considered. To complete the search, we will now find the closest point outside the radius (right child) and determine the second neighbor. The search method will be the same, but it will be for the right child.

Bud Bowl

The Bud Bowl was a stop motion animated Super Bowl advertising campaign first aired in 1989, and sporadically during the 1990s. It served as an advertisement for Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser family of beers. It featured Budweiser bottles playing a football game against Bud Light bottles.
History.
Bud Bowl I was aired in 1989 during the telecast of Super Bowl XXIII. David Henke and Bill Oakley of D'arcy Masius Benton & Bowles were the creative team behind the original Bud Bowl. The 3D computer graphics promotional spots preceding the game commercials were made by San Francisco Production Group. The stop-motion filming process was painstaking, involving eight hours of work to produce just three seconds of footage. Bud Bowl II was shot with stop motion animation by Broadcast Arts in NYC. Bud Ice and Bud Dry would make appearances in later Bud Bowls. Beer bottles with the voices of Terry Bradshaw and Tom Landry (the latter of which was topped with Landry's distinctive fedora) also made appearances. It has been jokingly said that the Bud Bowl was actually more exciting than the Super Bowl itself in some years. Starting with the fourth edition, a consumer contest was tied to the commercials, with game pieces distributed in the product packaging. Gambling on the outcome of the Bud Bowl was also common, despite the fact that some people knew the results before the actual airing.
In later years, Bud Bowl was retained as an advertising promotion, but in different forms. In 1996, it served as a contest only. Game pieces with football plays written on it were distributed, and viewers with the winning play on their piece won. By 1998, it was mostly removed from television. Bud Bowl was used often in static store display promotions, and/or contests. By 2002, it was attached to a series of local events, such as concerts, festivals, and "block parties," taking place at the host city of the Super Bowl in the days leading up to the game.

Cannizaro Park

History.
The park is the remnant of the gardens of the former country house at its centre (now a hotel). The house, originally known as Warren House, was built in the 18th century and was owned by the Grosvenor and Drax families who, for most of its history, let it to a series of wealthy tenants. The adjacent Royal Wimbledon golf course and the western parts of Wimbledon village were also once parts of the estate. 
Between 1785 and 1806, Home Secretary and Secretary of State for War, Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, occupied the house. At this time it was a major social centre for royalty and senior politicians (George III and Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger both stayed there regularly). Dundas organised the landscaping of the gardens, the basic structure of which remains today. Lady Jane Wood in the gardens is a memorial to his wife.
In 1817, Sicilian Francis Platamone, Count St. Antonio and his Scottish wife Sophia leased Warren House and held regular parties and concerts, whose attendees included Prime Minister the Duke of Wellington and Mrs Fitzherbert, mistress of King George IV. The Count left his wife and returned to Italy in 1832 when he inherited the title Duke of Cannizzaro. The Duchess remained at Warren House until she died in 1841. After her death the house came to be known by her husband's title (with a variation in the spelling).
A major fire at the beginning of the 20th century destroyed much of the house but it was rebuilt and extended to its current arrangement. In the 1920s Cannizaro House was owned by Admiral Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax. He sold it to the Wilson family, its last private owners. During his exile from Ethiopia, Emperor Haile Selassie lived in the house, and is commemorated by a modern bust in the park.
The Wilsons owned the house until the late 1940s and made a series of improvements in the gardens with the planting of new trees, Rhododendrons, Azaleas and Camellias. In 1947, the house and gardens were sold to Wimbledon Borough Council. The gardens were opened to the public shortly afterwards and the house was for a time used as a nursing home.
The London Borough of Merton sold the house in the 1980s and it was subsequently converted to its current use as a hotel. The surrounding gardens remain in council ownership and are open to the public. Most parts are well maintained, keeping the character of a large private garden, with many distinct areas and small "garden rooms", but the elaborate Italian Gardens are largely unplanted. For a number of years the Italian Gardens saw opera performances in the summer as part of the Cannizaro Festival, but in 2013 the festival was not held.
The place name ""Cannizzaro"".
"Cannizzaro" (which was a property belonging to the family "Platamone di Sant’Antonio") is a touristy locality on the Ionian shelvy coast of Eastern Sicily between Aci Castello and Catania.
One of the main Etnean medical centres bears the name of "Ospedale Cannizzaro" since it has been built within its territorial bounds. This toponym likely arises from:
A) the Low Latin term "Canniciarium", ""a place that abounds with reeds, a site made of reeds, a grove of reeds"";
B) the Arabic expression "Ayn An-Nisar", meaning ""the Spring water of Sacrifice"".
In both cases the primeval scenery that inspired the local naming has been ravaged over the centuries by many changes due to frequent lava streams and blasting eruptions.

RainbowCrack

RainbowCrack is a computer program which generates rainbow tables to be used in password cracking. RainbowCrack differs from "conventional" brute force crackers in that it uses large pre-computed tables called rainbow tables to reduce the length of time needed to crack a password drastically. RainbowCrack was developed by Zhu Shuanglei, and implements an improved time-memory trade-off cryptanalysis attack which originated in Philippe Oechslin's Ophcrack.
Some organizations have made RainbowCrack's rainbow tables available free over the internet.

Halton, Cheshire

Halton, formerly a separate village, is now part of the town of Runcorn, Cheshire, England. The name "Halton" has been assumed by the Borough of Halton, which includes Runcorn, Widnes and some outlying parishes.
Geography.
The village stands in an elevated position at compared with the surrounding area which lies at about . At its centre is an outcrop of sandstone which rises to a height of . On the summit of the outcrop are the ruins of Halton Castle. The major road, Main Street, passes below the castle, to its west and south, and Castle Road leads up to the castle.
History.
There is evidence of human occupation in the Stone Age and during the Roman era. The village is recorded in the Domesday Book and towards the end of the 11th century the first castle, which became the seat of the Barons of Halton, was built on the hill. During the medieval period a deer park measuring lay to the south and the west of the village. At this time Halton had a weekly market and annual fair. The village held a court leet and the castle was used as a prison. During the Civil War the castle was held by the Royalists and twice besieged by Parliamentary forces. Following this the castle fell into ruin. The importance of Halton declined with the coming of the Industrial Revolution and the development of the chemical and other industries in Runcorn.
Today.
The village is now entirely residential. It is surrounded to the west and north by the estates of Runcorn New Town. To the south is Halton Lea, a shopping mall, and other retail and entertainment outlets. To the east is Town Park. The castle is a Grade I listed building and a scheduled ancient monument, and there are a number of other listed buildings in the village. There are two public houses, the Castle Hotel, which is incorporated into the structure of the castle and which contains the former courthouse, and the Norton Arms. In the village are two active churches, the Anglican Church of St Mary and Trinity Methodist Church.
The Village has a Millennium Green, one of a series of 245 charity-run public Greenspaces created at the Turn of the Millennium.

Marrakech Museum

The Museum of Marrakech is a museum in the old center of Marrakech, Morocco. 
The museum is housed in the Dar Menebhi Palace, built at the end of the 19th century by Mehdi Menebhi. The palace was carefully restored by the Omar Benjelloun Foundation and converted into a museum in 1997. The house itself represents an example of classical Andalusian architecture, with fountains in the central courtyard, traditional seating areas, a hammam and intricate tilework and carvings. The museum's large atrium (originally a courtyard, now covered in glass and fabric) contains a very large centrally hung chandelier-esque ceiling piece consisting of metal plates decorated with fine geometric and epigraphic cuttings. Several features of the original courtyard, including the floor-set basins and mosaics have been retained.
The museum holds exhibits of both modern and traditional Moroccan art together with fine examples of historical books, coins and pottery of Moroccan Jewish, Berber and Arab cultures.
