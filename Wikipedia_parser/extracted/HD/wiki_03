Seyid Yahya Bakuvi

Seyid Yahya Bakuvi () – was an Azerbaijani scientist and philosopher of medieval ages. Seyid Yahya Bakuvi was born in Shamakhi into a rich family. Seyid Yahya Bakuvi lived in the 15th century, in Baku in the palace of Khalilullah I. In his youth he was engaged in Sufism, and was a follower of the eminent Sheikh Sadr ad-Din al Khalvati, leader of the tariqa’s Shirvan. After the sheikh’s death, Seyid Yahya quarreled with a student Pirizade about who would lead Khalvati’s sect; he then left Shamakhi to move to Baku. In Baku he settled in the palace of Khalilullah I, where he enjoyed wide popularity as a philosopher and scientist. Soon the number of his followers (in countries of the Near East, too) exceeded ten thousand people. 
According to one source, the date of Bakuvi’s death was 862 AH (1457), to another it was 868 AH (1463). There is a mausoleum of Seyid Yahya Bakuvi in the Shirvanshahs’ Palace complex. The date on that building is the date of mausoleum's construction.
Bakuvi’s works.
15 works of Seyid Yahya Bakuvi have been saved up to date. His works have a sufistic and mystic character. They are kept in cities of Turkey: Istanbul (“Muradiye” library), Konya, Manisa. Seyid Yahya wrote such philosophic treatises as “Sharkh-I Gulshani-raz”(“Comments to flower garden of secrets”), “Asrar at-Talibin” (“Secret’s of searchers of the truth”), “Symbolism of signs”, “Comments to the Safavids dynasty”, “Secrets of spirits” and others, penetrated through religious and mystic ideas which are valuable sources in the sphere of investigation of philosophy, astronomy and math.

Department of Taxes and Attorney General's Chambers Building

The Department of Taxes and Attorney General's Chambers Building (sometimes shortened to Attorney General's Chambers Building) is currently the tallest building in Botswana and one of the most expensive buildings built in Africa. The building, located in the Government Enclave on Nelson Mandela Drive in Gaborone, is home to the Botswana Department of Taxes and the Attorney General's Chambers.
History.
Miscommunication and financial mismanagement caused construction of the building to grossly exceed both the deadline and budget. The part of the building originally for the Attorney General's Chambers was assigned to three other departments (i.e. the Ministry of Commerce and Industry; the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communications; and the Department of Architecture and Building Services) before being assigned to the Attorney General once again. Lesego Motsumi, Minister of Works and Transport, reported that "the project had a time delay of 544 days which resulted in an additional cost of P11,734,464.27" (US$1.9 million in July 2007).
Architecture.
The building's design has been criticised for its glass windows, which can cause high energy costs in a hot climate.

Joseph A. Shannon

Joseph A. Shannon (1859-1934), known in at least one source as John A. Shannon, was an architect in Devils Lake, North Dakota.
He has been termed "the city's first true architect". He apparently had no formal degree in architecture, yet applied for and became one of North Dakota's first licensed architects in 1917. He designed 17 buildings in Devils Lake, of which 15 survived in 2001, of which the Devils Lake Masonic Temple is the "best example".
Shannon was born March 21, 1859 and grew up in Edina, Missouri. In Minnesota he worked as a carpenter, then established a homestead near Bristol, South Dakota, and later worked as a carpenter at Fort Sisseton in South Dakota. For three He served as president of the North Dakota State Board of Architecture. He lived in Devils Lake until his death on January 25, 1934.
A number of his works are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.
Works include (with attribution as given in NRHP documents):
According to the NRHP nomination, from 1989, for the Devils Lake Commercial District, the Dickey Free Library was designed by 
"John A. Shannon", late in his career. That appears to be a misstatement of local architect Joseph A. Shannon's name.

Aldesago is accessed by a steep and winding road from Lugano. This road then crosses the southern slopes of Monte Brè to reach the village of Brè. Trasporti Pubblici Luganesi (TPL) bus route 12 operates along this road from Lugano city centre to Brè village, with one or two buses per hour. The Monte Brè funicular, which connects the Lugano suburb of Cassarate, itself served by frequent city buses, to the summit of Monte Brè, serves a stop in Aldesago and runs every half-hour.
The church in Aldesago was first mentioned in 1636, but this building was demolished in 1941 to make way for road works. The replacement church, known as the Oratory of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, was consecrated in 1943.

<doc id="36530668" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36530668" title="World Ocean Review">
World Ocean Review

The World Ocean Review is an extensive report, dealing with the state of the world ocean, the interactions between the ocean and ecological, economical and sociopolitical conditions. It is meant to inform the general public about the current state of the ocean without trying to scare and terrify anyone. There is a print and a free to download version on the official website of the project. It is published by the non-profit organization maribus, founded by the mareverlag in Hamburg, Germany.
40 Scientists from the Kiel Cluster of Excellence "Future Ocean" incorporated many studies from the fields of climate and ocean research into the report. The World Ocean Review was first published in 2010 and is supposed to be redone periodicly. The scientific facts in this book are supposed to be helpful to those who want to actively participate in the current discussion about climate and ocean research.
Chapters.
1. The world oceans, global climate drivers.
This chapter gives a quick introduction into our complex climate system and the interactions between the atmosphere, cyrosphere, ocean, lithosphere and biosphere and the different factors that influence them, such as solar radiation, wind and ocean currents.
2. How climate change alters ocean chemistry.
This chapter explains the connections between CO2 uptake of the ocean, ocean acidification and the thus resulting dangers for the ecosystem ocean on the basis of current scientific knowledge. Furthermore the consequences of climate change for methane hydrates are illustrated.
3. The uncertain future of the coasts.
This chapter explains the sea level rise because of heat expansion, the melting of land bound ice sheets and the accompanying dangers for coastal regions. The anthropogenic influence on the world’s coasts is also part of this chapter.
4. Last stop: The ocean – pollution of the seas.
This chapter covers everything from over fertilization with organic contaminants to garbage and oil as hazards for the ocean and the people of our planet.
5. Climate change impacts on marine ecosystems.
Even the smallest climate changes can have enormous repercussions on many organisms of different parts of the ecosystem ocean. Such snowball effects are exemplified in this chapter. Also part of the chapter is the response of an ecosystem to an encroaching alien species.
6. Exploiting a living resource: Fisheries.
This chapter gives a brief introduction into the matter of deep-sea fishery. The necessity of the resource fish for mankind and the accompanying problem of overfishing are illustrated. The reasons and possible improvements to fisheries management are also part of the chapter.
7. Marine minerals and energy.
Fossil fuels, marine minerals, methane hydrate, offshore generation of renewable energies hold great potential for mankind, but can also be endangering not just for the climate and ecology. All this is illustrated in this chapter.
8. Maritime highways of global trade.
This chapter covers mainly economical aspects of the world’s maritime traffic, but also looks at the increasing dangers of piracy and terrorism.
9. Medical knowledge from the sea.
Today pharmaceutical ingredients can’t just be extracted from marine organisms (e.g. for cancer therapy) but they can also be used for cause studies for disease origins. This chapter illustrates the decoding of new substances, the research of partly very old diseases and the legal situation of marine medicine research.
10. The law of the sea: A powerful instrument.
This chapter covers the legal system and governance of the ocean. The protection of marine mammals and the legal situation regarding the country borders in the Arctic Ocean are part of this chapter.

Constantine Phokas

Constantine Phokas (, died 953/954) was a Byzantine aristocrat and general. 
Constantine was the youngest son of Bardas Phokas the Elder, and brother of the general and later emperor Nikephoros II Phokas and the general Leo Phokas the Younger. When his father was appointed as Domestic of the Schools (commander-in-chief of the Byzantine army) in 945, Constantine was appointed "strategos" (military governor) of the theme of Seleucia, on the Empire's southeastern border with the Muslim world.
He participated in his father's campaigns against the Muslims, and was captured by the Hamdanid Emir of Aleppo, Sayf al-Dawla, at the Battle of Marash in 953. Constantine took part in Sayf al-Dawla's subsequent triumphal entry into Aleppo, but he soon fell ill and died (probably in early 954). Some Byzantine sources suggest that he was poisoned by Sayf al-Dawla after refusing to convert to Islam, while Arab sources claim that he was poisoned by Byzantine agents after Sayf al-Dawla refused a huge ransom offered by Bardas Phokas. Whatever the truth, Constantine's death seems to have been blamed on Sayf al-Dawla by the Byzantines, and many Arab captives, including some of the Hamdanid emir's relatives, were executed as a result. Some Byzantine and Arab sources claim that this resulted in the failure of a peace embassy sent by the Byzantines in June 954 under Paul Monomachos, but modern scholars discount this.

<doc id="36530741" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36530741" title="Temple of the Cross Complex">
Temple of the Cross Complex

The Temple of the Cross is the largest and most significant pyramid within a complex of temples at the Maya ruins of Palenque in the state of Chiapas in Mexico. It is located in the south-east corner of the site and consists of three main structures, the Temple of the Sun, the Temple of the Cross, and the Temple of the Foliated Cross. The temple is a step pyramid containing bas-relief carvings inside. The temple was constructed to commemorate the rise of Chan Bahlum II to the throne after the death of Pacal the Great. The bas-relief carvings reveal Chan Bahlum receiving the great gift from his predecessor. The cross motif found at the complex allude to the names given to the temples, but in reality the cross is a representation to the World Tree that can be found in the center of the world according to Mayan mythology.
History.
The Temple of the Cross complex was built by Kan-Bahlum who reigned between 684 AD and 702 AD. One purpose of the temple was to house the panels that recorded Kan-Bahlum's ancestral history, his accession and the divine origin of his lineage. In the sanctuaries in the temples there are carved stone tablets to be found, one tablet for each tower containing hieroglyphic information about the purpose of each temple. They also contain information about the Palenque triad of gods (GI, GII, and GIII) and their right to leadership.
The pyramids in the Cross Complex were built in the Late Classic period of the Mesoamerican chronology, constructed according to the general Mesoamerican architectural traditions. They relied on intricate carved stone to make the spectacular stair-step design. These three temples are the only structures in the Maya realm that play the role of a Maya codex (bark paper book) in three parts. Within the temples there is both real and mythical history recorded. The recorded history is cohesive; as you move from temple to temple, you can read the history as if it were a book.
Archaeologist have evidence that the site was attacked by Calakmul in 599 and 611. The attacks may have inspired the building tradition initiated by Pacal and continued by his son, K'inich Kan Bahlam, and grandson, Akul Mo' Naab. After the site was attacked by Toniná the construction of elaborate and complex buildings stopped around 800, and a the population of the site decreased. 
When the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, Palenque had been abandoned and forgotten by the Maya in the region. In 1567 Father Pedro Lorenzo de la Nada was the first European to study and publish a description of the ruins which he named Palenque. Father Pedro Lorenze de la Nada was exploring near the Usumacinta River where he stubbled upon its stone temples and plazas.
Excavation, maintenance, and restoration of the Cross Complex was not initiated until 1940. More funding for maintenance came after Mexican archaeologist Alberto Ruz Lhuillier in 1952 discovered the burial tomb of Pacal the Great in the Temple of Inscriptions. Since the discovery of Pacal's tomb, the site has become one of the most extensively studied archaeological sites in the Americas. Archeologist Jorge Acosta expanded excavation and conservation of the Cross Complex from 1967 to 1974. The Palenque Project led by archeologist Arnoldo González Cruz in 1989 initiated extensive research, restoration, and conservation projects on the Cross Complex. In 1993 archaeologists found an offering containing more than 100 incense burners within the Temple of the Cross.
Structure.
The Cross Complex site is located at the bottom of the mountain Yehmal K’uk’ Lakam Witz, The Great Mountain of the Descending Quetzal. Yehmal K’uk’ Lakam Witz was considered a sacred mountain by the Maya because of the many natural springs that supply fresh water to Otulum River. The Otulum River was the principal water source for the city.
The Cross Complex structures are built from limestone which is widely available throughout the region. According to accounts from the 16th century, the stone temples were covered in stucco and decorated with blue and red paint. The three main temples that comprise the Cross Complex are aligned to form a cross. 
The Temple of the Foliated Cross is directly across the courtyard from the Temple of the Sun, and both are adjacent to the Temple of the Cross. Temple XIV and Temple XV are two smaller temples are found between the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Cross. The picture to the left is a reconstruction as seen from the Temple of the Foliated Cross, although Temple XV is missing from the illustration.
Bas-reliefs.
Temple of the Cross Group is one of the most important sources of glyphic text of the Maya culture. The Cross Group Complex along with Temple XIX and the Temple of Inscriptions details almost 200 years of Palenque's history and succession of kings.
Bas-relief carvings in the Temple of the Cross describe the accession of K'inich Kan Balam to the throne of Palenque. Within the inner chamber of these temples bas-relief carvings are found, depicting two figures. At first scientists thought that the smaller figure was K'inich Janaab' Pakal, Kan Bahlum's father, and that the bigger figure was K'inich Kan B'ahlam himself. Now, with a greater knowledge of iconography and epigraphy, it is believed that both figurines represent Kan Bahlum: one in his youth at the ritual of passage, and the other at adulthood representing his accession to the throne. Between these figures is the Ceiba, also known as the World Tree.
Representing paths to the Otherworld, each one of the three temples is also dedicated to a certain god in the Palenque triad. These paths to the Otherworld were crucial for the reigning king, since he must take them in order to bring back gifts of life and prosperity to his people. In this group of temples, the most significant is the Temple of the Cross which is associated with the God GI, the first born in the triad, also known as Hunahpu. Human by aspect, he is far more recognisable than his brothers because he has a shell earflare, a square-eye and a fish fin on his cheek. He is known to wear the quadripartite Monster as a headdress and he is also associated with the so called Waterbird. What should be remembered is that Kan-bahlum lived and reigned before any of the triad Gods and that he constructed and built these temples so that the triad gods could put their mark on them.

The Anglican Church of St John the Baptist, Westbourne is situated in the village of Westbourne, West Sussex. The church is part of the Diocese of Chichester and is dedicated to the beheading of John the Baptist.
History and Architecture.
The Domesday Book published in 1086 includes two churches entered under the Manor of Warblington (which at the time incorporated the Manor of Westbourne) It is possible that one of these either Saxon or Norman foundations was in Westbourne – potential evidence for this might be traced to claims made during the church’s restoration in 1865, where ‘large square bases of early Norman pillars’ were allegedly seen on the site where the present pillars stand. The current church that stands today consists of structures dating back to the early 13th century and other appendages and renovations since then.
In the early 13th century, the church included a nave with north and south aisles extending as far west as the present east arch of the tower, and a chancel of the present size. In the late 14th century, the rector and 6th Earl of Arundel carried out considerable alterations. The nave and aisles were extended west, the old west wall being penetrated by three arches, new windows were inserted in the aisles and the chancel and the tower in the south-west corner was potentially erected; following these changes, the church reached its current size. In the early 16th century, the 11th Earl of Arundel refashioned the nave in the existing Gothic perpendicular style, replacing thick pillars and round arches with tall slender pillars and three centered flat arches. The chancel was raised and widened, and the north porch was built – at the same time, the present west tower was built and its predecessor was taken down (the remains of a pier is still visible inside the church on the south wall of the south aisle) 
In 1545, the Avenue of Yew Trees was planted: it is believed that it is the oldest in the United Kingdom. In 1958, the north and south galleries were erected over the aisles, dormer windows were added, a flat ceiling was added to the nave and the singing gallery was erected under the tower. In 1770, the then-Lord of the Manor Earl of Halifax added a spire to the tower. The spire originally had an external gallery and an ornament. In 1797, the church was re-floored partly with Purbeck stone and brick, new pews were installed, old choir stalls in the chancel were cleared and painted glass was taken out of the chancel windows. In 1860, the gallery and ornament were removed from the spire and pinnacles were removed from the tower. In 1865, extensive restoration was carried out. boxed pews, galleries and flat ceilings were cleared away, dormer windows were removed, new pine pews were placed in the church and the south porch was built. The original stone north porch was dismantled and rebuilt in oak. These changes were described by architectural scholar Nikolaus Pevsner as being "really unpleasant". In 1876, the organ chamber was built and new choir seating was installed, and Philip Mainwaring Johnston undertook further work in 1932–33. In 1957, the spire was re-shingled and the weather vane that had been blown away in 1894 was re-erected. In 1978, the vestry was extended and in 1981 the church was re-floored in stone. 
All of the stained glass present today was placed in the windows between 1865 and 1912, with the exception of the west window to the south aisle that was made from a collection of older glass and placed in the window in 1840. The church graveyard was closed in 1859 and is still lined by a fine wall.
In 1892, a tin church was built in the nearby village of Woodmancote and was incorporated into the benefice of Westbourne.
Worship.
Each Sunday, Parish Communion and Evensong take place in the morning and evening respectively; on Wednesday, a service of Holy Communion also takes place. St John the Baptist uses the Book of Common Prayer and Common Worship and also offers services directed at families and children - including a crèche, Sunday school and various youth groups. Like many other English churches, music is an important part of worship as there is a strong choral foundation that is responsible for providing choral music.
Organ
The first record of an organ at the church was made in 1819, although little is known about the instrument. In 1862, a one manual organ constructed by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd was installed - it was enlarged fourteen years later to include a second manual (Swell division) In 1890, W. J. Haywood of London carried out additions to the organ, including an 8' reed to the swell and 16' Open Wood to the pedals. Hele & Co of Plymouth rebuilt the organ in 1967, and notably replaced the mechanical action with electro-pneumatic action. In 2001, Kenneth Tickell & Co built a new organ that remains in use today. 
Bells
Originally the church had four bells, as recorded in 1724, but the number has risen to six in 1770 and then to eight in 1933. At present the church uses full-circle ringing and the bells are rung for each of the Sunday services. The heaviest bell, a tenor bell, weighs almost half a ton and forms an octave with the other bells.

An aspect that accompanied the new president was its effort to keep squad's important players, which goes against the old capitalist policy imposed by the preceding president Zezé Perrella, which took post from 1995-2002 and 2008-2011. Fact that was very criticized by the supporters; that provided the basis for a manifestation in the possession, including banners charging for a policy change, that might have instigated the new president to adhere to a new prudence.

Ludwig van (film)

Ludwig van (full title: "Ludwig van: A report"; German: "Ludwig van: ein Bericht") is a black-and-white German film by Mauricio Kagel. Filmed in 1969, it was first screened the following year. The work was commissioned by Westdeutscher Rundfunk for the bicentennial celebrations of the birth of Ludwig van Beethoven in 1970. The film examines the reception of the composer and his works and how he has become a consumer product of the culture industry. The soundtrack is an arrangement of fragments of Beethoven's works, modified as if heard by the deaf composer himself; it is distinct from Kagel's 1970 composition "Ludwig van". Prominent contemporary artists including Dieter Roth, Stefan Wewerka (de), Robert Filliou, and Joseph Beuys were involved in the design. According to "Gramophone", "at first it’s a laugh a minute ... then Kagel's film turns dark".
Summary.
In the first part of the film, Beethoven visits Bonn of the late 1960s, stopping off at a record shop before embarking upon a tour of the Beethoven-Haus in which he was born; there is a deluge of busts, in the music room every surface is covered in sheet music, and in the final scene his works are in the laundry. There ensues a bridge passage in which he strolls along the Rhine and boards the "Cecilie", where he tries to find the source of music but ends up chasing shadows. The second part of the film, a more explicit parody of art films and commentary on the composer's reception, begins with a talk-show in which Karajan is criticised for creating beautiful sound at the expense of revolutionary edge and for conducting the orchestra rather than the music; there follows an encounter with a madman who claims to be Beethoven's true descendant; a sequence set to "In questa tomba oscura" ("In this dark tomb let me rest"); a scene with a pianist in a lab; and a recital of the Waldstein sonata by a thinly-disguised and super-annuated Elly Ney, where she ends up smoking and the percussive sound morphs into the beating of the heart; the film ends with a scene in a zoo with an owl, tortoise, boar, defecating elephant, and "many ruminants, predominantly ears and paws", accompanied by fragments of the "Prisoners' chorus" from "Fidelio" and of the "Ode to Joy" from the Ninth Symphony.
Analysis.
A deconstructive analysis of the film investigated Beethoven as a cultural icon, revered yet exploited; the use and misuse of his works, including their appropriation to advance nationalist agendas; the difficulties and anxieties of influence performers face; Beethoven scholarship and attempts to "tame" the composer to accord with bourgeois ideals; and the difficulties of peering through the myths to catch a glimpse of the "real" Beethoven. Kagel uses the term "Musealisierung" or "musealisation" in speaking of the Beethoven cult, the term used by Theodor W. Adorno to indicate that "museums are the family sepulchres of works of art".

Nerone (1930) is an Italian comedy film, directed by Alessandro Blasetti. It stars Ettore Petrolini as the main actor. It has been described as a "Roman farce", a genre which was popular in Italy at the time. It is a parody of imperial Rome and of the notorious Roman emperor, Nero. 
A full copy of the film no longer exists, there are only several excerpts that were included in the documentary "Antologia Petrolini" that was edited by the National Film Library and was showed at the 1952 Venice Film Festival.
Production.
It is the first of three sound films interpreted by Ettore Petrolini who, flanked by some members of his theater company, performs here in some of the characters that had made him famous: Pulcinella, Gastone, Fortunello, Nero.
In Italy it grossed nearly 5 million lire, an impressive success for the time, compared to € 35,000,000 today. 
Blasetti, despite self-defining his role as just a "technical coordinator", without any directorial role, he left his mark, starting from the idea of the "spoken" opening titles. He was particularly critically appreciated for the choice of shots and camera movements, including the initial use of camera dolly, that was technically very challenging for the time.

Wolfson Economics Prize

The 2012 Wolfson Economics Prize was a contest for proposals on how the Eurozone could be safely dismantled. The contest was initiated by Baron Wolfson of Aspley Guise and organised by the Policy Exchange think tank. The contest ended on 5 July 2012, when the Capital Economics team, led by Roger Bootle, won the prize. The second Wolfson Economics Prize was launched on 14 November 2013. The question for this new prize is “How would you deliver a new Garden City which is visionary, economically viable, and popular?”
2012 Prize: Launch.
On 18 October 2011, British businessman and Conservative life peer Simon Wolfson launched a contest that offered a £250,000 reward "for an individual to come up with a plan for how the euro could be safely dismantled."
The deadline was set on 31 January 2012.
Wolfson, at the launch, stated: 
There is now a real possibility that political or economic pressure may force one or more states to leave the euro. If this process is mismanaged it could threaten European savings, employment and the stability of the international banking system. 
This prize aims to ensure that high quality economic thought is given to how the euro might be restructured into more stable currencies. 
Consideration will need to be given to what a post-euro eurozone would look like, how transition could be achieved and how the interests of employment, savers, and debtors would be balanced. Importantly, careful consideration must also be given to managing the potential impact on the international banking system. 
The contest was organised by Policy Exchange, the London-based British think tank. Policy Exchange has been described as "the largest, but also the most influential think tank on the Right". Policy Exchange describes itself as "an independent, non-partisan educational charity seeking free market and localist solutions to public policy questions."
Simon Wolfson, Baron Wolfson of Aspley Guise, is chief executive of clothing retailer Next. He is the son of former Next chairman David Wolfson, Baron Wolfson of Sunningdale, also a Conservative life peer.
2012 Prize: Scope of submissions.
The organisers determined that submissions should focus on:
2012 Prize: Panel of judges.
The panel of judges who would decide on the award was as follows:
2012 Prize: Submissions and finalists.
Some of the world's top economists were among the participants with a total of 425 entries. 
Among the entrants was 11-year-old Jurre Hermans from the Netherlands who, notably, likened Greek debt to a pizza. Hermans' plan suggested that Greeks should be incented to return euros for debt repayment and, if they did not, should be fined at least the equivalent of what they held back. Returned euros would form, according to Hermans, what he described as "a giant pizza of money, slices of which would be handed back to creditors".
Antal E. Fekete, Professor of Mathematics and Statistics at the Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada, proposed a return to the gold standard. 
In his "Daily Telegraph" column, business journalist Jeremy Warner suggested that "there is no need for an award", since he has a "very simple plan": In any country that decided to leave the Eurozone, each euro would be swapped for one "new euro" plus units in the country's new currency in proportion to the country's share of eurozone GDP. For instance, if Greece were to leave, the euro would be split 97.5 percent "new euro" and 2.5 percent "new drachmas".
Capital Economics, in their entry, stated that a country contemplating leaving the euro would have to "keep its plans secret until the last minute," introduce capital controls, start "printing" a new currency only after formal exit, seek a large depreciation, default on its debts, recapitalise busted banks and seek close co-operation with remaining eurozone members. "Such a rebalancing of the economy away from reliance on net exports would be in the interests of the whole of the current membership of the eurozone, as well as countries outside it”. 
The short list of finalists was:
2012 Prize: Winning Entry.
On 5 July 2012, Policy Exchange announced that the winning entry was submitted by the team led by Roger Bootle from Macroeconomics research consultancy firm Capital Economics, titled "Leaving the Euro: A Practical Guide".
The proposal recommended that member-states who want to exit should introduce a new currency and default on a large part of their debts. The net effect, the proposal claimed, would be "positive for growth and prosperity". It called for keeping the euro for small transactions and for a short period of time after the exit from the Eurozone, along with a strict regime of inflation-targeting and tough fiscal rules monitored by "independent experts".
The Roger Bootle/Capital Economics plan also suggested that "key officials" should meet "in secret" one month before the exit is publicly announced, and that Eurozone partners and international organisations should be informed "three days before". 
Roger Bootle said, after the announcement, "if executed correctly, the pain of exit would relatively soon be replaced by a return to growth," something that would encourage other distressed states still in the currency zone to exit as well, adding 
"The biggest danger of contagion will be if Greece makes a success of leaving the monetary union".
2014 Prize: Launch.
On 14 November 2013, Simon Wolfson announced that he intended to offer a new £250,000 Prize to the entrant who best answers the question "How would you deliver a new Garden City which is visionary, economically viable, and popular?" He had previously expressed an interest in this topic in an article in The Times on 4 December 2012, and garden cities had in 2012 been cited as credible responses to the UK's housing shortage by both David Cameron and Nick Clegg, the UK's Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister respectively.
The deadline for submissions to the 2014 Prize was Monday 3 March 2014. Entrants were asked to submit an essay on the topic of up to 10,000 words (plus a 1,000 word non-technical summary).
2014 Prize: Panel of judges.
The panel of judges who would decide on the award is as follows:
2014 Prize: submissions and finalists.
On 14 April, Simon Wolfson announced that there had been 279 entries to the 2014 competition. The finalists were announced on 4 June 2014 and were:
• Barton Willmore, led by James Gross. Barton Willmore is the UK’s largest independent planning led town-planning and design consultancy. Barton Willmore's entry sets out a ten-point plan for the delivery of a new garden city, arguing for the development of a cross-party consensus and the production of a National Spatial Plan to identify suitable locations for new garden cities. Garden City Mayors, heading up Garden City Commissions, would be appointed to champion garden cities and find specific locations for development.
• Chris Blundell FRICS FCIH, Director of Development & Regeneration at Golding Homes. Chris is a development professional with over 30 years’ experience and has entered in a personal capacity with the support of Golding Homes. His entry argues that a garden city should accommodate between 30,000 and 40,000 people (about the size of Letchworth) and that its delivery should be led by Garden City Development Corporations.
• David Rudlin of URBED, with Nicholas Falk (also URBED) and input from Jon Rowland (John Rowland Urban Design), Joe Ravetz (Manchester University) and Peter Redman (Managing Director, Policy and Research at TradeRisks Ltd). URBED is an urban design and research practice. David’s entry argues for the near-doubling of an existing large town in line with garden city principles, to provide new housing for 150,000 people (about the size of Oxford or Canterbury). The entry offers a proof of this ‘urban extension’ concept based on a fictional town called Uxcester.
• Shelter, the leading housing and homelessness charity, led by their Head of Policy Toby Lloyd. This entry proposes a new garden city on the Hoo Peninsula (Medway, Kent) commencing with a settlement of up to 48,000 people (about the size of Welwyn Garden City) at Stoke Harbour as part of a larger cluster of settlements eventually totaling 150,000 people.) The entry proposes a model designed to attract massive private investment into the provision of high quality homes, jobs, services and infrastructure. The delivery model prioritises speed and volume over profit margins, aims to acquire land at low cost and transfer valuable assets to a Community Trust for the long term. Local people would be offered unique opportunities to invest in the city, including through buying shares.
• Wei Yang & Partners in collaboration with Buro Happold Consulting Engineers, led by Pat Willoughby. Wei Yang & Partners is a London-based practice with an international portfolio of master planning, town planning, urban design and architectural projects. Dr Yang is also advising the Chinese Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development on its urbanization programme. Their entry argues that an ‘arc’ beyond the London Green Belt (stretching from Portsmouth to Oxford to Cambridge to Felixstowe) is the best location for the development of new garden cities; and that the Government should publish a New Garden Cities Strategy identifying broad ‘areas of search’ for suitable locations, with a 30 year timescale.

London and Provincial District Telegraph Company

The London and Provincial Telegraph Co. Ltd. was formed in 1859 as the "London District Telegraph Co. Ltd.", being renamed in 1868.
The management were connected with the "British and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Co" and the firm aimed to compete with the dominant Electric Telegraph Company in the London area. Its original Chairman was the banker and Member of Parliament Samuel Gurney (1816–1882). It used a combination of underground and overhead wires and saved money by avoiding the need for an Act of Parliament to authorise its activities. The overhead wires, however, required negotiation with individual households and landowners and were vulnerable to damage in bad weather. The firm employed many female clerks who were supervised by a "Matron" and "Sub Matrons".
In 1860 the company agreed with the Astronomer Royal to relay the Greenwich Observatory time-signal to all of its offices.
Despite an extensive network of lines in London, the company never made a net profit and only once an operating profit. It was acquired by the Postmaster General in the general nationalisation of private telegraph companies under the Telegraph Act 1868.
The company issued a number of telegraph stamps which are of interest to philatelists.

National Convention of New Sudan

The National Convention of New Sudan was an assembly organized by the Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement (SPLA/M) in Chukudum, Eastern Equatoria April 2-13, 1994. Over five hundred delegates took part in the event. The convention focused on questions of governance, rather than strategies of the ongoing war with the government in Khartoum.
The National Convention had initially been scheduled to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the founding of the SPLA/M, May 16, 1993. It had however been postponed. A Convention Organising Committee (COC), consisting of 35 military officials of SPLA, had been formed to prepare the event. The COC was led by Yousif Kuwa, who also chaired the convention.
In his opening speech at the convention, the SPLA/M Chairman John Garang declared the convention as sovereign body. The convention established a system of three branches of government in New Sudan; legislative, executive and judicial. 
The issue of union (i.e. unity of Sudan) and separatism was dealt with at the convention. John Garang, who preferred unity, accepted a shift in policy of the movement which accommodated separatist demands. 'New Sudan' was defined as applying only to the 'liberated areas' under the control of SPLA/M, in contrast to the unionist definition in the original SPLA/M Manifesto which had defined 'New Sudan' as a future united, secular Sudan. The election of the new SPLA/M leadership carried the mandate of 'to fight and achieve the right of Self-determination for the oppressed people of the New Sudan'. A system of local governments was formalized, with five levels (boma, payam, county, region and central). Five regional administrations of New Sudan were created, namely Bahr el-Ghazal, Equatoria, Southern Blue Nile, Southern Kordofan and Upper Nile. The convention instituted reforms of the legal system in the areas under SPLA/M control. Various laws, such as the New Sudan Penal Code and New Sudan Traffic Act, were drafted.
The convention elected a new National Liberation Council/National Executive Committee of SPLA/M. John Garang was elected chairman and Salva Kiir deputy chairman, both unopposed.

Jacques Gillot (jurist)

Jacques Gillot (1550? – 1619) was a French priest and jurist, and reputed author, a Gallican opponent of the Society of Jesus.
Gillot was a councillor-clerk of the Parlement de Paris, and also a canon of the Sainte-Chapelle. He was notorious for associating with freethinkers; the Queen called him "the Lutheran priest". He was also Dean of Langres Cathedral.
One work where Gillot's part is attested is "Satyre Ménippée de la vertu du catholicon d'Espagne et de la tenue des éstats de Paris" (1599) Gillot was a reputed collaborator in the "Satire Ménippée". The other authors are given as: Pierre Leroy (a canon of Rouen), Pierre Pithou, Nicolas Rapin, Florent Chretien, and Jean Passerat.
The "Vita Calvini" of Jean Papire Masson was often incorrectly attributed to Gillot in the 17th century. The "Traictez des droicts et libertez de L'Eglise gallicane" (1609) is traditionally attributed to Gillot, but on unclear grounds.
Gillot was a correspondent of Paolo Sarpi, and was one of the anti-Jesuit circle that circulated the unlikely story of Pierre Coton and the questions he had supposedly prepared to ask an exorcised spirit. Others in his correspondence network were Isaac Casaubon and Joseph Scaliger.

Besso, Ticino

Besso is a quarter of the city of Lugano, in the Swiss canton of Ticino. It forms the part of the city which is uphill of Lugano railway station, and is separated from the city centre by that station and its rail approaches. Besso was developed as a residential area in the late nineteenth century, driven by the opening of the railway in 1882. By 2011, it had a population of 4,993.
Road access to the city centre is via a tunnel under the railway line, whilst access on foot is also possible using the station pedestrian subways, and thence the Lugano Città–Stazione funicular. Trasporti Pubblici Luganesi (TPL) bus route 3 connects Besso to the city centre, operating four or more buses per hour, whilst TPL route 16 connects an inner terminus on the Besso side of the railway station to Muzzano on a less frequent basis. The station can be directly accessed from the Besso side.
The administrative headquarters, and radio studios, of Radiotelevisione svizzera di lingua italiana (RSI), the Italian language Swiss TV and radio broadcaster, are in Besso. The former seminary, dedicated to Saint Carlo Borromeo, now houses the Swiss Italian Conservatory and the Swiss National Sound Archive.
Besso's church of Saint Nicholas of Flüe dates from 1950 and was built, by the architect Giuseppe Antonini, as a votive church. The facade is decorated with a mosaic by Francois Romand Ribas, whilst the separate bell tower contains five bells. The interior is notable for a bronze door by Venanzo Crocetti, a large ceramic by Angelo Biancini depicting four saints, and stained glass windows by the Swiss artist Willy Kaufmann.
Besso is home to a kindergarten, an elementary school and a middle school, as well as a branch of the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training. The Parco Tassino is a public park in the south-east of the quarter, famous for its display of roses.

Paddy George

Kenneth Brooking "Paddy" George (28 May 1883 – 10 August 1950) was a New Zealand rugby footballer of the 1900s and '10s, playing representative rugby league for New Zealand (non-Test matches) (#32), and Wellington, as a .
Playing career.
George originally played rugby union in the Auckland Rugby Union competition for the City club. In 1904, along with Paddy Long, he was found guilty of match-fixing and suspended for 10 years.
George subsequently moved to Wellington and in 1908 he was part of the very first rugby league match on New Zealand soil, at the end of the 1907-08 All Golds tour.
George then represented Wellington and was part of the 1909 New Zealand tour of Australia. In 1912 he was part of the committee that founded the Newtown rugby league club, which took part in the inaugural Wellington Rugby League competition.
During the 1913 tour of New Zealand by New South Wales, George played against the touring party twice - for Wellington and New Zealand.

Note.
George's nickname of Paddy does not appear to be derived from his given names of Kenneth Brooking, although rugbyleagueproject.org, nzrl.co.nz, and nzleague.co.nz erroneously state his given name as Patrick, this could be a case of reverse-annotation from the nickname Paddy.

Rock Me on the Water

Origin.
William Ruhlmann at Allmusic.com wrote that Browne was performing the song as early as autumn 1970. "In the songs he was writing shortly before his recording debut in 1972, Jackson Browne continually alluded to apocalyptic events, but never more explicitly than in 'Rock Me...'," he wrote. Browne is documented as saying that the song, with its reference to the "sisters of the sun," pays homage to his real-life sisters.
Browne addressed the gospel and religious issues in the song, saying that "it's not about religion, it's about society." The song is meant to employ gospel language, but, he said, he turns "it around 180 degrees... If you heard even three seconds of it, you would say, 'well, that's gospel,' but you have to have an idea in a gospel song, and if it's not going to be Jesus, then it must at least be salvation. If I say 'when my life is over, I'm going to stand before the father, but the sisters of the sun are going to rock me on the water now' is like a way of, lovingly, and in a friendly way, refuting the traditional and conventional messages of redemption having to do with the straight and narrow... I staked a lot on that song, because it was a combining of that social awareness and paying attention to what's going on around, with the inner search for spiritual meaning."
Browne's collaborator Craig Doerge is credited with playing piano on the song in addition to Browne.
The original single from 1972 and the version on Browne's self-titled album are actually two different performances of the song - the timing discrepancy is not due to an edit of the album version. The single has not been released on an album or CD.
Reaction.
Bud Scoppa, in his March 1972 review of the "Jackson Browne" debut album, stated that "Rock Me..." would make an excellent single and that the song's "lilting gospel-like movement" showed a Van Morrison influence.
Bruce Springsteen referenced the song in his speech upon the induction of Browne into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004 saying: "Listen to the chord changes of 'Rock Me on the Water' and 'Before the Deluge,' it's gospel through and through."
Cover versions.
Browne did a version of the song with country singer Kathy Mattea for the Red Hot + Country AIDS/HIV awareness benefit album released in 1994.

Biancur Field

Biancur Field, (Eglin Air Force Base Auxiliary Field #6), is a satellite airfield located northwest of the Main Base, 5.9 miles north-northeast of Valparaiso, Florida. It is also known as site "B-6".
Overview.
The U.S. Army Ranger facility Camp Rudder is located here. It is designated Site B-6. The airfield remains under the ownership of the United States Air Force, and is under the jurisdiction of the 96th Air Base Wing (96 ABW) at Eglin AFB. 
History.
Auxiliary Field 6 is named Biancur Field for 1st Lt. Andrew Biancur, a test pilot of the Medium Bombardment Section of the 1st Proving Ground Group, killed 8 January 1944 in the crash of YP-61-NO Black Widow, "41-18883", c/n 711, at Eglin Field.
The history of Biancur Field is largely unknown, and the exact date of construction of Biancur Field is undetermined. It was opened in 1943 and was constructed in a similar manner to a fully equipped base with three 4,000-foot runways, a large parking ramp, at least one hangar and numerous support buildings. The airfield was expanded sometime after the war, with an 8,000-foot jet runway laid down over the 18/36 north/south runway. The airfield was incorporated into Eglin AFB on 9 October 1959 and was inactivated. However, Biancur was reactivated in 1970 as an Army Special Forces group, led by Col Arthur D. "Bull" Simons, for training before deploying to Thailand for the attempted rescue on 20-21 Nov 1970 of US POWS at the Son Tay prison camp in North Vietnam (Operation Ivory Coast). 
Afterwards, the United States Army Ranger training camp at Epler Field (Auxiliary Field #7) moved to Biancur Field to provide realistic jungle/swamp training. Today the ground station has numerous modern buildings, and the north-south airfield runway has been updated for use by helicopters with several hangars. Several UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters are parked on the ramp in recent aerial imagery of the airfield.
The NASA X-43 low-speed demonstrator underwent testing out of Auxiliary Field 6 in November 2003.
Federal Prison Camp.
A low security Federal Prison Camp, established under a maintenance contract with the Air Force, originally located at the old Niceville Road Prison where German POWs had been incarcerated during World War II, from November 1962, was moved to a compound at Auxiliary Field 6 in November 1969, and served as a minimum security facility for non-violent offenders. It would gain the nickname "Club Fed". The facility was closed in 2006 as a cost-cutting measure, with most of the prisoners transferred to the Pensacola Federal Prison Camp, Saufley Field, at NAS Pensacola in December 2005.

William Stanger (surveyor)

William Stanger (27 September 1811 Tydd St. Mary, Wisbech – 14 March 1854 Durban) was best known as a surveyor-general in South Africa, but was also a geologist, botanist and medical doctor. He was the son of Willam Stanger and Mary Dent. He studied medicine and natural science at Edinburgh University, and after returning from a trip to Australia and New Zealand, ran a practice in London for some time.
William Stanger took part as geologist and doctor in the ill-fated 1841 British expedition to the Niger. Three vessels steamed about 320 miles up the Niger and Chadda. Treaties were signed with the two black Princes of Eboe and Iddah, agreeing to the abolition of the slave trade and of human sacrifices, and the signatories were then left to resume their normal practices. An extract from a letter written on board the ""Æthiope"" on the 21st of October 1841 -
""We entered the Nun on the 10th inst., and proceeded up the river the next morning, and fell in with the "Albert" on the evening of the 13th inst. at Stirling Island, about 24 miles below Eboe. We found her in a worse state than the "Wilberforce"; all hands down with fever but for Drs M'William, Stanger, a scientific gentleman, a marine, the boatswain's mate, and a servant. Captain Trotter very weak, Captain Bird Allen (who is since dead) very low; no engineers; Dr. Stanger was endeavouring to work the engine the best way he could. We sent our head engineer on board, and the "Albert" followed the "Æthiope" to the coast. Captain Becroft then went on board the "Albert", and took her to Fernando Po."" - "The Times", 27 January 1842
And from the report of Captain Trotter: ""From want of engineers we should have had to drop down the whole length of the river without steam, had not Dr. Stanger, the geologist, in the most spirited manner, after consulting Tredgold's work on steam, and getting some little instruction from the convalescent engineer, undertaken to work the engine himself. The heat of the engine-room affected the engineer so much as to throw him back in his convalescence, and prevent him rendering any further assistance, but Dr. Stanger took the vessel safely below Eboe, without anything going wrong with the machinery."" 
Stanger arrived in poor health in the Cape in 1843. He came highly commended by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and immediately started on surveying the route for the proposed road joining Cape Town to Grahamstown. In 1845 he was appointed surveyor-general in Natal. One of Stanger's first tasks was fixing Natal's exact boundary and mapping its main geographical features, publishing a topographical map in 1848. Following on this he carried out a survey of Durban, Pietermaritzburg and smaller villages, and planned the route of the main road between Durban and Pietermaritzburg. Stanger erected the small building which later housed the Natal Training College in Pietermaritzburg, and which became Government House in 1850, having been acquired by Sir Benjamin Pine, Lieutenant Governor of Natal (1850-1855).
According to an obituary in the "The Lancet", Stanger suffered a premature death as a consequence of the so-called "hydropathic treatment". A horseback ride from Pietermaritzburg to Port Natal (Durban) had exhausted him, and he was persuaded to 'submit to the application of the "wet shed". The next day inflammation of the lungs took place, which carried him off in one week'. 
Botany was one of Stanger's enduring interests and the genus "Stangeria" was named in his honour, as was the small town of Stanger in Natal, laid out in March 1873 by the incumbent surveyor-general Dr. P.C. Sutherland and named after his late predecessor.
Marriage.
William Stanger married on 22 September 1842 in Lowestoft, Sarah Hursthouse (17 August 1809 Wisbech - 4 May 1873 Hunstanton), daughter of Charles Hursthouse (1781-1854) and Mary Jecks (1785-1821). 
The marriage produced four children:

Alt Empordà fires of 2012

On July 22, 2012 two fires in Alt Empordà, Catalonia, Spain started in la Jonquera and in Portbou that affected the Girona Province for three days. The first started during midday; it has affected 13,800 hectares (included in this are some 3,000 hectares of crops that have not burned) 19 municipalities and caused two deaths. The fire of Portbou, moreover, began at 19:00 and was controlled in a few hours, burning 50 hectares and killing two people trying to flee the encroaching flames by jumping from the cliffs into the sea. In total, 3,200 residents were left without electricity and 1,700 without phone.
Precedents.
This was the largest fire in the area since 1986. Between July 17–24 of 1986 a serious fire burned out of control, devastating 26,000 hectares and killing the four man crew of a French seaplane. On August 7, 2000 a fire began in Cap de Creus that burned 6,513 hectares; much of the Parc Natural.
Context.
Both fires occurred during a summer very conducive to fires as Catalonia has suffered major droughts in the past 40 years. In addition, many forests were in poor condition after the snowstorm of 2010.
In February, 2012 the Fire Department had reported to Parliament that the cuts would undermine their work, "reducing their capacity by 378,000 working hours of what the country will need for summer."
La Jonquera fire.
The first of two fires that affected the region was declared a little before noon on July 2, 2012 at the edges of the 779th kilometer N-II (in parking lot of trucks about 500 meters from the border crossing with France). Of the two fires, this was the most devastating in terms of the amount of land affected (about 14,000 hectares).
Causes.
The disaster was caused by negligence, as noted by the President of the Generalitat of Catalonia, Artur Mas, from the fire station in Figueres. The Minister of Interior, Felip Puig said that the fire—just like what happened to Portbou—began on the shoulder of the road; later the forest rangers found hundreds of cigarette butts in the area where the fire originated, which gave further strength to the hypothesis that the fire had been caused by human negligence.
Path of the fire.
The fire spread very quickly, fueled by the strong tramuntana winds and affecting almost 14,000 hectares, from Albera National Park down, nearly to the town of Figueres. This composition of the area was 51% were trees, 22% crops, and 19% brush. Of the 14,000 hectares, 3,000 (containing agricultural crops) were not burned. The fire threatened the towns of Llers and Capmany reaching homes and burning some in Jonquera and Agullana. At points, the flames reached five meters in height.
The increasingly strong southwest and eastern winds created fears that fire would enter into the Garrotxa region and affect the Garrotxa Volcanic Natural Park, thus making it more difficult to combat the fire on land due to the dense forest and the topography of the land. According to Felip Puig, Minister of Interior of the Generalitat of Catalonia they are currently working to protect the most sensitive points around Terrades, southern Boadella, Darnius and Agullana, and the northern regions of el Pertús and Cantallops.
Consequences.
The la Jonquera fire left two people dead: the first, suffered a heart attack in the town of Llers, after being trapped by flames in the garden of his home and the second died after suffering burns to 80% of the body in an explosion of fuel tanks in Agullana. Eight people were hospitalized, six of them serious injuries. Furthermore, several sections of the northern part of la Jonquera were evacuated along with some farms and residential areas that were far removed from urban centers of the Alt Empordà.
As soon as the fire was declared, they AP-7 and N-II were closed to traffic along with several county roads and the AVE line to la Jonquera. Due to the fire, the electricity company, Endesa estimated that more than 3,000 people in 21 towns remained without power. The authorities required a curfew for the entire population of Alt Empordà from the afternoon of 22nd which was slowly revoked in later days. Some 1,300 people spent the nights of 22nd and 23rd in emergency shelters in the region.
The 19 municipalities affected were as follows: la Jonquera, Agullana, Darnius, Boadella i les Escaules, Terrades, Vilarnadal, Avinyonet de Puigventós, Vilafant, Figueres, Llers, Pont de Molins, Biure, Masarac, Cabanes, Sant Climent Sescebes, Capmany, Cantallops, Vilanant i Cistella. The smoke and smell of the fire was encountered in Barcelona as well as further south. Smoke was also seen around Céret, France.
The region is a well known grower of wine grapes and olives which form a large portion of income for the region. Overall, most of the vineyards were not affected by the fire as they acted as a natural firebreak due to how they are cultivated. Some were immersed in a considerable amount of smoke, but did not burn.
Aftermath.
The fire left many trees and shrubs burnt around La Jonquera, although little of the town's structures were burnt. The final death toll was four.
Portbou fire.
Alongside the fire started in la Jonquera, another started in the municipality of Portbou, in the northeast area of Alt Empordà, near the border with France. It started on Sunday, the 22nd July at 19:00 and three hours later, at 22:00, it was already under control.
Causes.
The mayor of Portbou, José Luis Salas, said that the fire could have been caused by a cigarette thrown from the road, just like the fire started in the Jonquera. Some sources suggest that the fire started near the gas station in the town.

Words Beats &amp; Life

Words Beats & Life inc. is a Washington DC based hip-hop non-profit working to "transform individual lives and whole communities through elements of hip-hop culture." Founded as a hip-hop conference in 2000 at the University of Maryland, College Park, Words Beats & Life separated from the University to become a separate organization in 2002, officially incorporated as a 501(c)(3) in 2003. Words Beats & Life works with the community by teaching, convening, and presenting hip-hop through the Urban Arts Academy, the Cipher, and publication of the first peer-reviewed academic journal of global hip-hop culture.
Words Beats & Life Academy.
According to The Washington Post, the Words Beats & Life Academy “aims to transcend the familiar beats and rhymes and use hip-hop as a catalyst to change lives.” Starting as a Saturday program, the Academy grew into an afterschool and summer program that serves 150 students during the year and up to 300 during the summer. Classes are taught by practicing artists, who serve as mentors for their students. Youth, ages 5–23, participate in pre-vocational arts programming to hone skills in graffiti and visual arts, B-boying, DJing, and emceeing. In addition to skill mastery, the urban arts academy focuses on self-awareness and employability, using hip-hop as a platform to engage students in learning, building community, and thinking about their futures. For example, emceeing helps students sharpen public speaking skills, and DJing connects students to technology and engineering. Visual arts skills are used to paint murals and Words Beats & Life has worked in conjunction with the DC Government on the Murals DC project, which aims to redirect the energy of graffiti artist to legal projects to beautify the city.
The Cipher.
The Cipher is a national network, connecting institutions, organizations, and individual artists and scholars using hip-hop as a medium to promote social change. Traditionally, hip-hop organizations are often absent from conferences and symposia in their respective fields, and therefore working in isolation. Through publication of a peer-reviewed academic journal and an annual Teach-in, Words Beats & Life works to bring together scholars, educators, artists, and activists who use hip-hop as a tool for social change in a discussion of how to work together as a community and maximize the collective capacity to make change.
The Journal.
"Words. Beats. Life: The Global Journal of Hip-Hop Culture" is the first academic peer-reviewed journal of hip-hop studies, also showcasing the talents visual artists and poets in the field. Combining art and scholarly work intends to present a dialogue between different mediums. Featuring established intellectuals and artists in the field as well as previously unknown individuals, the journal is a resource for hip-hop scholars and non-profits, representing current developments in the field.
Signature Events.
"Bum Rush the Boards" is an annual hip-hop chess tournament created in 2005 as a more inclusive alternative to traditional chess tournaments. Named after Public Enemy’s 1987 album Yo! Bum Rush the Show, the tournament aims to connect the hip-hop generation to chess as a model of “overcoming through strategic struggle.” In addition to chess matches cultivating strategic thinking, the event includes workshops about the elements of hip-hop culture and how they related to STEM fields.
"Remixing the Art of Social Change" is an annual teach-in hosted at Howard University since 2007, bringing together organizations, artists, and scholars that use hip-hop culture to promote social change. Through roundtables, panel discussions, film screenings, and workshops that build on the efforts of the previous teach-ins, the event showcases work being done and creates a network for individuals and organizations to connect and advance how hip-hop is used as a medium to promote positive change.
"The Freshest of all Time" is DC’s largest B-boy/B-girl jam featuring prominent b-boy crews from DC, Maryland, Virginia, Philadelphia, Boston, and New York. The battle drew more than 600 people in 2009, and 800 in 2010.

She couldn't get over the fact that I stlll spoke French like a native. Sometimes I'd translate Proust for her, or Charles Trenet lyrics. She told me she'd had a French nanny as a kid and had once believed she spoke French fluently, but no longer could remember a word of it."

Equivalent Concrete Performance Concept

According to the Equivalent Concrete Performance Concept a concrete composition, deviating from the EN 206-1, can still be accepted, provided that certain conditions are fulfilled.
Conditions.
A concrete composition not composed by the standard EN 206-1, can be acknowledged, only if the new concrete shows a performance equal to the standardized concrete concerning environmental classes. Cementcontent and water-cement ratio are important elements hereby.
De comparison with standardized concrete is tested by following properties:
When the new concrete scores equally or better, a certificate of utilization can be obtained from certificating organizations.
Standardization.
The valid standards concerning concrete are:
These national annexes serve to elaborate the functional description of the Equivalent Concrete Performance Concept.
Concrete composition.
Standardized concrete is a highly durable material, predominantly thanks to the increasing amount of cement at stricter environmental classes. But cement is a costly component and has a relatively powerful impact on the environment. 
Partly because of this, alternative binders such as fly ashes and slags are applied in the concrete sector. As a result, the content of Portland cement can be reduced in many cases. Other recycled raw materials can also contribute to a more economic or less environmental polluting concrete composition. 
1. Usage of residual products from the concrete industry, for example stone dust (from crushing aggregates), concrete slurry (from washing mixers) or concrete waste
2. Usage of residual products from other industries, for example fly ash from coal plants and slags from the metallurgical industry
3. Usage of new types of cement with reduced environmental impact (mineralized cement, limestone addition, waste-derived fuels)
Durability.
To respect the Kyoto Protocol, the CO2-emission should be reduced.
Green concrete exists out of recycling or is composed is such a manner, that it is as environmental-friendly as possible.

History of the University of California, Santa Barbara

The University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) traces its roots back to the 19th century when it (as well as Santa Barbara City College) emerged from the Santa Barbara School District, which was formed in 1866 and celebrated its 145th anniversary in 2011. UCSB's earliest predecessor was the Anna Blake School which was established in 1891 as an independent teacher's college. From there, the school underwent several transformations, most notably its takeover by the University of California system in 1944.
Early years.
The Anna Blake School offered training in home economics and industrial arts. The Anna Blake School was taken over by the state in 1909 and became the Santa Barbara State Normal School. The campus was on the Riviera in Santa Barbara, portions of which house today's Riviera Theatre. By 1913, the Riviera neighborhood was established and housing for up to 40 faculty and students built. (This housing is today's El Encanto Hotel.) 
In 1921, a liberal arts program was authorized and the school was renamed again to Santa Barbara State College. Growth was so rapid that a new campus was needed. When the 1925 Earthquake destroyed Dibblee's imposing stone mansion, Punta Del Castillo, on the cliff overlooking the harbor, land was available, and, by 1932, it had been purchased for the college. Remains of the mansion were cleared and the stone was used to build the retaining wall on Cliff Drive. The first building was completed in 1941.
Takeover by the University of California.
Intense lobbying by an interest group in the City of Santa Barbara, led by Thomas Storke and Pearl Chase, persuaded the State Legislature, Governor Earl Warren, and the Regents of the University of California to move the State College over to the more research-oriented University of California system in 1944. The State College system sued to stop the takeover, but the Governor did not support the suit. A state initiative was passed, however, to stop subsequent conversions of State Colleges to University of California campuses. From 1944 to 1958 the school was known as Santa Barbara College of the University of California, before taking on its current name. 
Originally, the Regents envisioned a small, several thousand-student liberal arts college, a so-called "Williams College of the West", at Santa Barbara. Chronologically, UCSB is the third general-education campus of the University of California, after Berkeley and UCLA (the only other state campus to have been acquired by the UC system). The original campus the Regents acquired in Santa Barbara was located on only of largely unusable land on a seaside mesa. The availability of a portion of the land used as Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara until 1946 on another seaside mesa in Goleta, which the Regents could acquire for free from the federal government, led to that site becoming the Santa Barbara campus in 1949. Originally, only 3000–3500 students were anticipated, but the post WWII baby boom led to the designation of general campus in 1958, along with a name change from "Santa Barbara College" to "University of California, Santa Barbara," and the discontinuation of the industrial arts program for which the State college was famous. A Chancellor, Samuel B. Gould, was appointed in 1959. All of this change was done in accordance with the California Master Plan for Higher Education.
20th century development.
In 1959, UCSB Professor Douwe Stuurman hosted the English writer Aldous Huxley as the university's first visiting professor. Huxley delivered a lectures series called "The Human Situation".
In the late 1960s and early 1970s UCSB became nationally known as a hotbed of anti-Vietnam War activity. A bombing at the school's faculty club in 1969 killed the caretaker, Dover Sharp. In the spring 1970 multiple occasions of arson occurred, including a burning of the Bank of America branch building in the student community of Isla Vista, during which time one male student, Kevin Moran, was shot and killed by police. UCSB's anti-Vietnam activity impelled then Governor Ronald Reagan to impose a curfew and order the National Guard to enforce it. Weapon-carrying guardsmen were a common sight on campus and in Isla Vista during this time.
Recent history.
In 1995, UCSB was elected to the Association of American Universities, an organization of leading research universities, with a membership consisting of 59 universities in the United States (both public and private) and two universities in Canada.
Since 2000, UCSB faculty have won five Nobel Prizes, significantly strengthening the academic profile and image of the university.
2014 Isla Vista killings.
On May 23, 2014, six students were killed after an attacker, later identified as 22-year-old Elliot Rodger, embarked on a killing spree in Isla Vista, a community located near the UCSB campus. The first three students, 20-year-old Cheng Yuan "James" Hong, 19-year-old George Chen, and 20-year-old Weihan Wang, were all stabbed to death in an apartment they shared with Rodger. The remaining three students were all shot and killed during a series of drive-by shootings; these victims were identified as 22-year-old Katherine Cooper, 19-year-old Veronika Weiss, and 20-year-old Christopher Michael-Martinez. Cooper and Weiss, both members of the Delta Delta Delta sorority, were killed in front of an Alpha Phi sorority house, while Michael-Martinez was killed in front of the Isla Vista Deli Mart. Three days after the killing spree, UCSB canceled its classes for May 27 and scheduled a memorial service for the victims on that same afternoon. In regards to the killings, the university released a statement, saying, "Our campus community is shocked and saddened by the events that occurred last night in the nearby community of Isla Vista. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families who are grieving and mourning as a result of this tragedy."
Provosts and Chancellors.
Santa Barbara State College was under the supervision of a President, but in 1944, when it became a campus of the University of California, the title of the chief executive was changed to Provost. In September 1958, the Regents of the University of California established Santa Barbara as a general University campus and at the official title of the chief executive was changed to Chancellor. UCSB's first Provost was thus Clarence L. Phelps, while UCSB's first Chancellor was Samuel B. Gould.

The Birth of Plenty

The Birth of Plenty: How the Prosperity of the Modern World Was Created is a nonfiction book on world history and economics by American author William Bernstein.
Summary.
"The Birth of Plenty" is an history of the world expressed in economic terms. Bernstein argues that in order to prosper, a country must possess four main attributes: property rights, the scientific method, capitalism and an effective communications infrastructure. After establishing these as the basic requirements for economic success, the book examines the historical progress of a number of countries both with and without these attributes. Bernstein further argues that the four attributes are a necessary precursor to democracy.
Reception.
"Publishers Weekly" described the book as, "authoritative... accessible and thoroughly entertaining". It also received positive reviews in the economic and investment community.

Epler Field

Epler Field, (Eglin Air Force Base Auxiliary Field #7), is a satellite airfield located west-northwest of the Main Base, 18.2 miles west of Valparaiso, Florida. It is designated Site B-12. 
Overview.
Auxiliary Field 7 is named Epler Field for Col. Robin E. Epler, deputy commander (Technical) of the Air Proving Ground Command, Eglin Field, Florida, killed 28 January 1944 in the crash of A-20G-10-DO Havoc, "42-54016", one mile (1.6 km) NE of Crestview, Florida.
History.
The history of Epler Field is largely unknown, and the exact date of construction of Epler Field is undetermined. It was opened in 1942 and was constructed in a similar manner to a fully equipped base with three 4,000-foot runways, a large parking ramp, at least one hangar and numerous support buildings. 
On 20 November 1951 The Army located its United States Army Ranger training camp at Epler Field to provide realistic jungle/swamp training. In January 1970, the camp moved to its present location at Biancur Field (Auxiliary Field #6).
The movement of the Ranger training camp was apparently the last active use of the field. All structures have been removed from the station area and the runways are shown as inactive. However, Epler is still an operating airfield that is used to support special operation activity within the Eglin complex. It is also known as Test Area B-12. Aerial imagery shows several F-4 Phantom II airframes on the parking ramp, along with an F-4 on the northwest runway end. There are also many stored shipping containers on the southwest runway end. 
The airfield remains under the jurisdiction of the 96th Air Base Wing (96 ABW) as part of the active Eglin base and is not accessible to the public. A large tower, with a radome is visible at the north end of the former station area

He made his feature directorial debut in horror film "Memento Mori" (1999), followed by romantic comedies "All for Love" (2005) and "All About My Wife" (2012), queer films "Antique" (2008) and "In My End Is My Beginning" (2013), and melodrama "The Last Blossom" (2011).
Career.
Min Kyu-dong studied Economics at Seoul National University, and upon graduation, he entered the Korean Academy of Film Arts (KAFA). In 1999 Min made his first feature "Memento Mori", alongside KAFA classmate and co-director Kim Tae-yong. Considered the most influential Korean horror film of the 2000s, "Memento Mori" has attained a modern-day classic status among Korean cinephiles. 
After pursuing further film studies in France, Min returned in 2005 with his sophomore effort and solo directorial debut "All for Love". Similar to Robert Altman's "Short Cuts" and Richard Curtis's "Love Actually", Min utilized a large ensemble cast to weave a multitude of stories into a single narrative. About a diverse group of couples and singles who experience love or tragedy in the span of one week in Seoul (the Korean title translates to "The Most Beautiful Week of My Life"), the film was a box office success. 
In 2008 Min explored homosexual eroticism in "Antique", a screen adaptation of the popular Japanese manga "Antique Bakery" by Fumi Yoshinaga. The film, about four pretty boys with hidden pasts working in a French pastry shop, was invited to the Berlin International Film Festival. 
For his segment in the 2009 omnibus film "Five Senses of Eros", Min continued his fascination with queer cinema. Using illusive and phantasmal cinematography, he brought a more experimental and dramatically edgy take on two women involved in a mild S&M relationship after the death of the man they both loved. A feature-length director's cut of "In My End Is My Beginning" was later screened at the 2009 Busan International Film Festival, then released in theaters in 2013. 
Based on the semi-autobiographical TV series by writer Noh Hee-kyung (previously adapted into a novel and a stage play, the Korean title translates to "The Most Beautiful Goodbye/Farewell in the World"), Min confessed that he "cried a lot while writing the screenplay" of "The Last Blossom". A moving story of a devoted mother diagnosed with a terminal illness whose family comes together for the first time to give her the support they’ve always denied her, the film received rave reviews from moviegoers and critics for its delicate depiction of family love.
In 2012 Min wrote and directed a remake of the Argentinean film "Un novio para mi mujer" ("A Boyfriend for My Wife"), which centers on a timid husband who hires a professional Casanova to seduce his seemingly perfect but fearsome wife. The romantic comedy "All About My Wife" became Min's biggest commercial hit yet.
Inspired by the "Arabian Nights", Min directed the wrap-around sequences that "introduce" each segment by bridging the four short films of omnibus "Horror Stories" with a tale about a kidnapper who can go to sleep only when he listens to scary stories from his young female victim. "Horror Stories" was the opening film of the 2012 Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival. For the sequel "Horror Stories 2", Min again directed the wrap-around sequences, this time structured around three mysterious insurance claim cases.
Personal life.
Min is married to Hong Ji-young, director of "The Naked Kitchen".

Urera baccifera

Urera baccifera is a species of flowering plant in the nettle family known by many common names, including ortiga brava, pringamoza, mala mujer, chichicaste, nigua, guaritoto, ishanga, manman guêpes, and urtiga bronca. It is native to the Americas from Mexico through Central America into South America, as well as the Caribbean.
This species is a shrub or a small tree. It can reach five meters in height. The thin, toothed leaves are up to 25 centimeters long by 12.5 wide. The blades are borne on long petioles. The plant is covered in spines and stinging hairs. The inflorescence is a pink or purple cluster of flowers, and the plant is dioecious, with male and female parts on different plants. The spongy, juicy fruit is green or pinkish. The seeds are dispersed by fruit-eating birds and capuchin monkeys.
This plant has medicinal and ritual uses among humans. Costa Rica Amerindians beat themselves with the spiny plant to prevent chills when traversing high mountains. It is also an anti-inflammatory. Extracts have shown antiviral activity against herpes simplex.
This plant grows in moist tropical forests. It is not very tolerant of shade, so it dies back when the overstory closes. It can be found in forests recently disturbed by fire.
In some areas, this plant is one of the first to bear fruit after the damage of a hurricane, and then it becomes an important food source for birds. The fruits also provide food for many species of ant. The ants also collect pearl bodies which form on the leaves, stems, and stalks of the plant. Ants performing this activity include species in genera such as "Camponotus", "Pheidole", "Crematogaster", and "Pseudomyrmex". When ants are present on a plant, they rid it of lepidopteran larvae which would feed upon it, such as "Smyrna blomfildia", "Urbanus esmeraldus", and "Pleuroptya silicalis". This provides a benefit for both plant and ant in a mutualistic relationship.

Hesham Qandil

Hesham Mohamed Qandil (also spelled: "Hisham Kandil ";  ) (born 17 September 1962) is an Egyptian engineer and civil servant who was Prime Minister of Egypt from 2012 to 2013. He was appointed prime minister by President Mohammed Morsi on 24 July 2012. Qandil previously served as minister of water resources and irrigation from 2011 to 2012. Reuters reported that Qandil was a politically independent senior public servant in the Morsi administration, but was not popularly considered to be a likely candidate for the position of prime minister. Qandil was Egypt's youngest prime minister since Gamal Abdel Nasser's appointment in 1954. He was arrested on 24 December 2013.
Early life and education.
Qandil was born in 1962. He holds a bachelor's degree in engineering, which he obtained from Cairo University in 1984. Then he received a master's degree in irrigation and drainage engineering from Utah State University in 1988 and a PhD in biological and agricultural engineering with a minor in water resources from North Carolina State University in 1993.
Career.
After graduation, Qandil joined the Egyptian civil service in the water resources department in 1985. From 1999 to 2005 he served as the office director for the minister of water resources. He participated in the work of the Nile Basin Initiative, and was an observer member of the Egyptian - Sudanese joint Nile water. He was also chief of water resources at the African Development Band, a position in which he worked for approximately six years, from 2004 to early 2011. He returned to Egypt following the 2011 revolution to help build up the country. In 2011, he was appointed minister of water resources and the Nile basin as part of Essam Sharaf's second Cabinet. Qandil was serving in that post when he obtained a PhD from North Carolina State University.
Prime Minister of Egypt.
On 24 July 2012, Qandil was designated as prime minister by President Mohamed Morsi. His appointment was seen as unexpected by the Arab media, including The Majalla. On 2 August 2012, he took office as prime minister and formed a technocrat-dominated government, with a few political parties (the Freedom and Justice Party, the Al-Wasat Party, and the Renaissance Party).
First Qandil Cabinet.
Qandil's first cabinet was presented on 2 August 2012. The cabinet consisted of 35 ministers, including technocrats, the Freedom and Justice Party members, the Al-Wasat Party members, and the Renaissance Party members.
Second Qandil Cabinet.
On 6 January 2013, ten ministers in the first cabinet of Qandil were changed. The reshuffle included ministry of finance, ministry of local development, ministry of transportation, ministry of legal affairs and parliamentary councils, ministry of electricity, ministry of interior, ministry of supply and social affairs, ministry of environment, ministry of communications and ministry of civil aviation. Following the reshuffle, the number of the ministers who were the members of the Freedom and Justice Party increased to eight in the cabinet.
Resignations.
On 2 July 2013, five cabinet members resigned together; they were Hisham Zazou, the tourism minister, Atef Helmi, the communications and IT minister, Hatem Bagato, the state minister for legal and parliamentary affairs, Abdel Qawi Khalifa, the water minister, and Khaled Abdel Aal, the environment minister. Mohamed Kamel Amr, the foreign minister, resigned as well.
Dismissal.
On 3 July 2013, an Egyptian appeals court endorsed a verdict dismissing Qandil of his duties and sentencing him to one year in prison for not executing a court ruling to re-nationalize the Tanta Flax and Oil Company. Subsequently, on the same day, President Morsi was removed from office and arrested by the Egyptian army, along with other leading Muslim Brotherhood figures. In late September 2013, the Cairo Misdemeanor Court endorsed the sentence against Qandil who could file appeal with the court of cassation.
Personal life.
Qandil is married and has five daughters.

Infineon XMC

XMC is a family of microcontroller ICs by Infineon. The XMC microcontrollers use the 32-bit RISC ARM processor cores from ARM Holdings, such as Cortex-M4F and Cortex-M0 . XMC stands for "cross-market microcontrollers," meaning that this family can cover due to compatibility and configuration options, a wide range in industrial applications. The family supports three essential trends in the industry: It increases the energy efficiency of the systems, supports a variety of communication standards and reduces software complexity in the development of the application's software environment with the parallel released eclipse based software tool DAVE.
XMC1000.
XMC1000 is a 32-bit microcontroller family with a Cortex-M0 core by ARM Holdings which was first introduced in early 2013 by Infineon.
XMC4000.
XMC4000 is a 32-bit microcontroller family with a Cortex-M4 core by ARM Holdings which was first introduced in early 2012 by Infineon. This microcontroller family uses the Cortex-M4 processor core with DSP function which is represented in numerous applications. Target applications in the industrial sector and multi-market can be: Actuators, solar inverters, manufacturing and building-automation, renewable energy and transportation. The XMC4000 family is divided into further series covering the various service areas and price ranges.
The XMC4000 family is specifically designed for the industrial sector and positioned in the Infineon microcontroller portfolio between the 16 - bit and 32-bit MCU technology. The focus is on target areas such as logistics, transportation, renewable energy, building control, and automation. Moreover, the ongoing trend of worldwide energy efficiency can also be found in this family. The goal is to reduce energy consumptions in controls of motors, solar inverters, SMPS I/O devices, without burdening this performance.
XMC4000 uses an ARM Cortex-M4 core, including single cycle DSP MAC and floating point unit (FPU) covering a frequency range from 80 MHz to 180 MHz. It uses 1 MB embedded Flash with built-in ECC hardware. It also has a 160 kB RAM.
XMC4500/XMC4400 series.
Both high-end family members have a 120 MHz CPU. Both XMC4500/XMC4400 are running on a 1 MB/512 kB flash and 160 kB/80 kB RAM.
XMC4200/XMC4100 series.
Infineon expands in November 2012 the XMC4000 Microcontroller Family. Both families the XMC4200 and the XMC4100 run with an 80 MHz CPU using an ARM Cortex-M4 core architecture. The difference between those two members is that the XMC4200 has a 256 kB Flash, 40 kB and the XMC4100 a 128 kB Flash with 20 kB RAM.
Development tools.
XMC4000 Application Kit.
The XMC4000 Application Kit is a modular, extensible application board consisting of a CPU board in the center and 3 satellites, the so-called extension boards. Due to this construction, the kit can be functionally extended to certain target applications and customized. The three satellites include the automation I/O Kit, an Ethernet / CAN / RS-485 Interface kit and a standard human interface kit. The Human Interface Board also (HMI), in addition to the OLED display plus audio, a touch and SD / MMC function. The COM board allows developers to create a kind of remote control over Ethernet. This board also supports MultiCAN and RS-485 interfaces. In addition to these three satellites, it allows developers to connect their own boards.
XMC4500 Relax / Relax Lite Kit.
The Relax Kit and the Relax Lite Kit are low budget evaluation boards for the XMC4000 microcontroller family. The board contains the XMC4500 microcontroller (XMC4500-F100F1024 AA, Package: PG-LQFP-100), an ARM Cortex-M4F CPU running at 120 MHz, 1 MB Flash and 160 kB RAM. Besides that the Relax and Relax Lite Kit have a detachable on-board debugger so developers can download and validate the code without additional hardware. The Relax Kit and the Relax Lite Kit offer a complete set of on-board devices and plugs to run USB-based applications and to develop human machine interfaces with buttons and LEDs. The Relax Kit extends the feature set with an Ethernet-enabled communication option. It also allows developers to explore mass storage and file systems using a microSD card. In addition, it comes with serial flash memory. DAVE 3 is a suitable free software for those kits to reduce software developing time by using so called DAVE apps. Dave apps are sw component blocks which easily can be combined and implemented from the DAVE3 library.
DAVE - Auto code generation free software tool.
DAVE (Digital Application Virtual Engineer) is an Eclipse-based software platform designed especially to reduce the software development effort and development time required for this. DAVE includes a GNU - compiler, a Debugger, and a visualization utility for graphic presentation of data. Other standard compiler and debugger can be added to the development environment. With pre-defined, tested applications, DAVE also supports automatic code generation. Alternatively, developers are free to integrate their own applications. Apps can be easily configured and adjusted using the graphical user interface to different applications.
Third Party Tools.
Following development tool vendors support the XMC4000 family:
Documentation.
The amount of documentation for all ARM chips is daunting, especially for newcomers. The documentation for microcontrollers from past decades would easily be inclusive in a single document, but as chips have evolved so has the documentation grown. The total documentation is especially hard to grasp for all ARM chips since it consists of documents from the IC manufacturer (Infineon) and documents from CPU core vendor (ARM Holdings).
A typical top-down documentation tree is: manufacturer website, manufacturer marketing slides, manufacturer datasheet for the exact physical chip, manufacturer detailed reference manual that describes common peripherals and aspects of a physical chip family, ARM core generic user guide, ARM core technical reference manual, ARM architecture reference manual that describes the instruction set(s).
Access to this documentation on the infineon website is only granted after accepting a NDA like license. This license e.g. forbids to publish any information from these documents, except one can proof that this information was published before.
STMicroelectronics has additional documents, such as: evaluation board user manuals, application notes, getting started guides, software library documents, errata, and more. See External Links section for links to official XMC and ARM documents.

<doc id="36531414" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36531414" title="Infineon XC800">
Infineon XC800

The Infineon XC800 Family is an 8-bit Microcontroller family, first introduced in 2005, with a dual cycle optimized 8051 "E-Warp" Core. The XC800 family is divided into two categories, the A-Family for Automotive and the I-Family for Industrial & Multi Market applications.
Applications.
Industrial and Multimarket.
The Industrial-Family also called I-Family product series ranging from 2KB to 64KB Flash memory and from 16- to 64-pin package options. It can be found in applications like motor control of eBikes, pumps and fans e.g. in air conditioners, as display or touch button controls or in digital controlled power supplies e.g. for motor drives or lighting
Automotive.
Automotive devices from the XC800 family can be found in, safety and powertrain applications like motorcycle BCM, lighting, window lift, low end airbags, steering angle sensors, pumps, cooling fans and valve/throttle controls. All devices are compliant with the AEC Q100 standards for automotive electronics.
Key features.
Core.
The instruction set consists of 45% one-byte, 41% two-byte and 14% three-byte instructions. Each instruction takes 1, 2 or 4 machine cycles to execute. In case of access to slower memory, the access time may be extended by wait cycles (one wait cycle lasts one machine cycle, which is equivalent to two wait states). The XC800 Core supports a range of debugging features including basic stop/start, Single-step execution, breakpoint support and read/write access to the data memory, program memory and special function registers. A 16-bit co-processor provides additional computing performance and is optimized for the processing of multiply / divide operations and for the execution of CORDIC algorithm for trigonometric operations.
Memory organization.
The 8-Bit MCUs have an embedded user-programmable non-volatile Flash memory that allows for fast and reliable storage of user code and data. It is operated with a single 2.5 V supply from the embedded voltage regulator (EVR) and does not require additional programming or erasing voltage. The sectorization of the Flash memory allows each sector to be erased independently. A Flash error correction (ECC) can detect double-bit errors and correct single-bit errors as well as protect against invalid code execution. Up to 3KB of RAM is featured, part of this memory being XRAM.
ADC.
The Analog Digital Converter module (ADC) uses the successive approximation method to convert analog input values (voltages) to discrete digital values with 10-bit resolution. One ADC kernel (ADC0) operates on a user-selectable number of input channels. The input channels can be selected and arbitrated flexibly.
CCU6.
The CCU6 is a capture and compare unit which generates PWM signals over different duty cycles and multiple output channels. It operates with 16-bit timers clocked at 48 MHz and can trigger the ADC operation to harmonize control loops. The CCU6 provides application specific modes, like for AC drive control or brushless DC-motors using Hall sensors or Back-EMF detection. Furthermore, block commutation and control mechanisms for multi-phase machines are supported.
Touch and LED Matrix control.
LEDTSCU is a functional unit for the control of capacitive touch pads and a matrix of LEDs through the same pins. For example 7 segment displays which are commonly used can be controlled by such a matrix. The principle of time multiplexed operation of two or more functions, in this case touch control and LED-control, reduces the amount of pins used. The capacitive touch control is adjustable in sensitivity to fit for various cover materials and a ROM library assists the application development.
Communication.
XC800 features a set of interfaces for serial communication including UART, SPI and I2C as well as CAN connectivity. CAN (Controller Area Network) is a robust serial bus designed for board to board communication in noisy environments such as automobile and industrial control systems. MultiCAN developed by Infineon improves upon previous CAN implementations by adding features such as additional CAN nodes, more message objects linked list management of message objects and support for TTCAN level 2.
Development Tools.
Evaluation Kits.
Easy Kits and Starter Kits are microcontroller evaluation boards available for all XC800 devices. Application Kits are more application specific kits e.g. for motor control designs. They contain example codes for various control schemes, power boards or motor types and the according hardware.

University of California, Santa Barbara campus

The University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) campus is located around 10 miles west of downtown Santa Barbara in Santa Barbara County, California. 
Overview.
The University of California, Santa Barbara is located on cliffs directly above the Pacific Ocean. UCSB's campus is completely autonomous from local government and has not been annexed by the city of Santa Barbara and thus is not part of the city. While it appears closer to the recently formed city of Goleta, a parcel of the City of Santa Barbara that forms a strip of "city" through the ocean to the Santa Barbara airport, runs through the west entrance to the university campus. Although UCSB has a Santa Barbara mailing address, as do other unincorporated areas around the city, only this entry parcel is in the Santa Barbara city limits. Like all other UC and CSU campuses, it is self-governing and cannot be incorporated into either city. The campus is divided into four parts: Main (East) Campus that houses all academic units plus the majority of undergraduate housing, Storke Campus, West Campus and North Campus. The campuses surround the community of Isla Vista.
UCSB is one of a few universities in the United States with its own beach. The campus, bordered on three sides by the Pacific Ocean, has miles of coastline as well as its own lagoon. Goleta Point, also known as Campus Point, is a rocky extension into the ocean. The campus has numerous walking and bicycle paths across campus, around the lagoon and along the beach.
Much of the campus' early architecture was designed by famed architect William Pereira and his partner Charles Luckman, and made heavy use of custom tinted and patterned concrete block. This design element was carried over into many of the school's subsequent buildings.
The Lagoon is a large body of water adjacent to the coastline, between San Rafael and San Miguel Residence Halls. It was created from a former tidal salt marsh flat and is fed by a combination of run-off and ocean water used by the Marine Science Building's aquatic life tanks; thus, it is a unique combination of fresh and salt water. Many of the older campus buildings are being replaced with newer, more modern facilities. The UCSB Libraries, consisting of the Davidson Library and the Arts Library, hold more than 3 million bound volumes and millions of microforms, government documents, manuscripts, maps, satellite and aerial images, sound recordings, and other materials. The 24 Hour Study Room, formerly known as the RBR (Reserved Book Room), is adjacent to the Davidson Library, which is located in the middle of the UCSB campus.
Campbell Hall is the university's largest lecture hall with 862 seats. It is also the main venue for the UCSB Arts and Lectures series, which presents special performances, films, and lectures for the UCSB campus and Santa Barbara community.
The UCSB Family Vacation Center founded in 1969, is a summer family camp located on campus that draws over 2,000 guests each summer. The staff of over 50 includes many UCSB students who have been extensively trained as camp counselors.
Layout.
The university (itself termed a "campus" of the University of California) is divided into two physical campuses, a West Campus and East Campus. The vast majority of university facilities, including all lecture halls and laboratories, are in the East Campus. The two campuses are connected by a large strip (known as the North and Storke Campuses) to the north which contain university housing and athletic fields. Thus, the university surrounds Isla Vista on three sides.
West Campus, aside from a few buildings dedicated to faculty housing, has largely been leased out to private organizations, and includes a school for the mentally disabled and a large nature preserve. The largest sand dunes on the south-facing coast of the Santa Barbara Channel are located here.
The East Campus centers around two quadrangles, separated from each other by the main library and bus circle, and the life sciences buildings. Along the western quad are Storke Plaza and buildings housing the various arts, social sciences, and humanities departments. The Student Resource Building and the Events Center are also located along this quad. Surrounding the wider, park-like eastern quad are buildings housing the physical sciences departments and the College of Engineering. Directly to the south of, but not adjacent to, the eastern quad are the life sciences and psychology departments, as well as most of the on-campus housing. The southernmost section of the campus is dominated by the lagoon. The peninsula extending from the beach into the lagoon contains an elaborate labyrinth.
Bicycles.
UCSB is known for its extensive biking system. Bicycles have exclusive right of way on paths throughout East Campus. Bicycle stands and lockers are ubiquitous. UCSB is unique among bicycle-heavy areas in that most travel is done within a small radius.
Buildings and structures.
Davidson Library.
The Donald C. Davidson Library is named in honor of Donald C. Davidson, who served as University Librarian from 1947 to 1977. It is UCSB's main library, holding the general collection and several special collections: The Sciences and Engineering Library, the Map and Imagery Laboratory, the Curriculum Laboratory, the East Asian Library and the Ethnic and Gender Studies Library. The university's Department of Special Collections are also part of the Davidson Library. The Special Collections hold rare books and manuscripts and several collections, which include the Performing Arts Collection, the Wyles Collection on the American West, the Skofield Printers' Collection, and the California Ethnic and Multicultural Archives.
Storke Tower.
Storke Tower is a landmark campanile (bell and clock tower) located in the centre of the UCSB campus. It can be seen from most places on campus, and it overlooks Storke Plaza. Dedicated for use on September 28, 1969, the 61-bell carillon tower stands tall. The bells range in size from 13 to 4,793 pounds, with the largest bell carrying the university seal and university motto.
Storke Tower is the tallest steel/cement structure in Santa Barbara County.
Ocean Science Education building.
The new Ocean Science Education building will house the Outreach Center for Teaching Ocean Science (OCTOS) and incorporate the educational outreach program of UCSB's Marine Science Institute (MS) and the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (CSMS) OCTOS is designed to expand science education for kindergarten through 12th graders. It will also provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, who will be voluntary guides, to learn about teaching science. 
The project will cost an estimated $20 million, $8 million of which has already been provided by the federal government. The remaining $12 million will reportedly be made available through private funds raised by the university. The building was supposed to be completed in August 2011 but the university terminated their contract with their contractor because he was many months behind schedule and did not complete the building by the projected date. So at this time, the project remains unfinished.

Uwajima Ushi-oni Festival

The festival has many events like the Ushi-oni parade and fighting as well as fireworks and dancing.
History.
There are a variety of views about the origin. According to "Nihon gaishi" (unofficial history in Japan) written by Raisanyō in 1880s, in the second Siege of Jinju (1593), Toyotomi Hideyoshi commanded Katō Kiyomasa to invasion of Korea. Toyotomi Hideyoshi was a daimyo, warrior, general and politician of the Sengoku period in Japan and Katō Kiyomasa was famous liegeman of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The reason was Toyotomi Hideyoshi commanded to Korea twice is the breakdown in negotiations between Korea and Japan. 
In 1593 June, Katō Kiyomasa attacked the Jinju castle in Korea. When Ushi-oni was useful. Katō Kiyomasa and Japanese soldier made a tortoise shell cart. Japanese soldier could hide by entering a tortoise shell cart so that they can save themselves for arrows and stones. As the result, Katō Kiyomasa and Japanese soldier attacked a behind castle and they could collapsed for castle. The tortoise shell cart was wrapped hard board and cowhide. The tortoise shell cart had fake cow head on top and the face look angry. Consequently, it called Ushi-oni. Now, the Ushi-oni is essential for Uwajima festival and it became familiar existence for Uwajima citizen.
Today.
The festival was started in 1950 and since then it has been held in July 22-24 annually, the festival name was originally Uwajima Syokō festival. Syokō means commerce and industry. In 1967, the Ushi-oni parade was started. In 1996, the festival name was changed and it became the current name.
Score of people shoulder the Ushi-oni and walking with bamboo flute sound by children. The flute called Kaifuki. The flute bore a hole in bamboo tube. Many children walking after the Ushi-oni while blow the Kaifuki and the custom came to Katō Kiyomasa blow the Kaifuki when attacked the Jinjyu castle. Many children and men walking with call out Wassyoi Wassyoi. Last day, run into another Ushi-oni because try to competition which is stronger.
Ushi-oni feature.
The name means cow ogre. Size is 5 or 6 meter and it has a long neck and the face like ogre. The Ushi-oni with palm fur or red fur all over and the tail like a sword. The Ushi-oni made of bamboo and log. The Ushi-oni has brave and powerful role in the festival. Many people go to houses around Uwajima with the Ushi-oni because they will do purification. In case of Lion dance, bite is a meaning of a purification but in the case of Ushi-oni, shake head is a meaning of a purification. Now, many variety of Ushi-oni was made. For instance, account of Ushi-oni is more than 20 and the color is many like blue and purple. In addition, children’s Ushi-oni is also existence. The children’s Ushi-oni size is smaller than the ordinarily Ushi-oni.
Festival activities.
The first day is called the Uwajima gaiya carnival. There are many 
street stalls and a display of fireworks. Second day, musical parade at Uwajima street and sale of local food. The second half of the day, mini Ushi-oni parade goes on. On that night, people dance Uwajima traditional dancing called Uwajima Ondo. The last day is the Ushi-oni parade. The 20 Ushi-oni walks about Nanyo culture center and go along Uwajima main street and shopping arcade. Finally, they go to toward Suka river and Warei shrine because put in the Ushi-oni. The admission is 3000yen and admission free to under junior high school students.

<doc id="36531538" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36531538" title="European Nucleotide Archive">
European Nucleotide Archive

The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) is a repository providing free and unrestricted access to annotated DNA and RNA sequences. It also stores complementary information such as experimental procedures, details of sequence assembly and other metadata related to sequencing projects.
The archive is composed of three main databases: the Sequence Read Archive, the Trace Archive and the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (also known as EMBL-bank). The ENA is produced and maintained by the European Bioinformatics Institute and is a member of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) along with the DNA Data Bank of Japan and GenBank.
The ENA has grown out of the EMBL Data Library which was released in 1982 as the first internationally supported resource for nucleotide sequence data. As of early 2012, the ENA and other INSDC member databases each contained complete genomes of 5,682 organisms and sequence data for almost 700,000.
Moreover, the volume of data is increasing exponentially with a doubling time of approximately 10 months.
History.
The European Nucleotide Archive originated from separate databases, the earliest of which was the EMBL Data Library, established in October 1980 at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Heidelberg. The first release of this database was made in April 1982 and contained a total of 568 separate entries consisting of around 500,000 base pairs. In 1984, referring to the EMBL Data Library, Kneale and Kennard remarked that "it was clear some years ago that a large computerized database of sequences would be essential for research in Molecular Biology".
Despite the primary distribution method at the time being via magnetic tape, by 1987, the EMBL Data Library was being used by an estimated 10,000 scientists internationally. The same year, the EMBL File Server was introduced to serve database records over BITNET, EARN and the early Internet. In May 1988 the journal "Nucleic Acids Research" introduced a policy stating that "manuscripts submitted to Acids Research and containing or discussing sequence data must be accompanied by evidence that the data have been deposited with the EMBL Data Library."
During the 1990s the EMBL Data Library was renamed the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database and was formally relocated to the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) from Heidelberg. In 2003, the Nucleotide Sequence Database was extended with the addition of the Sequence Version Archive (SVA), which maintains records of all current and previous entries in the database. A year later in June 2004, limits on the maximum sequence length for each record (then 350 kilobases) were removed, allowing entire genome sequences to be stored as a single database entry.
Following the uptake of Sanger sequencing, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (then known as The Sanger Centre) had begun cataloguing sequence reads along with quality information in a database called The Trace Archive. The Trace Archive grew substantially with the commercialisation of high-throughput parallel sequencing technologies by companies such as Roche and Illumina.
In 2008, the EBI combined the Trace Archive, EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (now also known as EMBL-Bank) and a newly developed Sequence (or Short) Read Archive (SRA) to make up the ENA, aimed at providing a comprehensive nucleotide sequence archive. As a member of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration, the ENA exchanges data submissions each day with both the DNA Data Bank of Japan and GenBank.
EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database.
The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (also known as EMBL-Bank) is the section of the ENA which contains high-level genome assembly details, as well as assembled sequences and their functional annotation. EMBL-Bank is contributed to by direct submission from genome consortia and smaller research groups as well as by the retrieval of sequence data associated with patent applications.
As of release 114 (December 2012), the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database contains approximately 5×1011 nucleotides with an uncompressed filesize of 1.6 terabytes.
Data classes.
The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database supports a variety of data derived from different sources including, but not limited to:
EMBL-Bank format.
The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database uses a flat file plaintext format to represent and store data which is typically referred to as EMBL-Bank format. EMBL-Bank format uses a different syntax to the records in DDBJ and GenBank, though each format uses certain standardised nomenclature, such as taxonomies as defined by the NCBI Taxon database. Each line of an EMBL-format file beings with a two-letter code, such as codice_1 to label the accession number and codice_2 for a list of keywords relevant to the record; each record ends with codice_3.
Sequence Read Archive.
[[File:History (and predicted future) size of the Sequence Read Archive.svg|thumb|left|240px|The SRA has grown rapidly since 2008. As of 2011, most SRA sequence data was produced by Illumina's Genome Analyzer.
The ENA operates an instance of the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), an archival repository of sequence reads and analyses which are intended for public release. Originally called the Short Read Archive, the name was changed in anticipation of future sequencing technologies being able to produce longer sequence reads. Currently, the archive accepts sequence reads generated by next-generation sequencing platforms such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer and ABI SOLiD as well as some corresponding analyses and alignments. The SRA operates under the guidance of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) and is the fastest-growing repository in the ENA.
In 2010 the Sequence Read Archive made up approximately 95% of the base pair data available through the ENA, encompassing over 500,000,000,000 sequence reads made up of over 60 trillion (6×1013) base pairs. Almost half of this data was deposited in relation to the 1000 Genomes Project wherein the researchers published their sequence data to the SRA in real-time. In total, as of September 2010, 65% of the Sequence Read Archive was human genomic sequence, with another 16% relating to human metagenome sequence reads.
The preferred data format for files submitted to the SRA is the BAM format, which is capable of storing both aligned and unaligned reads. Internally the SRA relies on the NCBI SRA Toolkit, used at all three INSDC member databases, to provide flexible data compression, API access and conversion to other formats such as FASTQ.
Data access.
The data contained in the ENA can be accessed manually or programmatically via REST URL through the ENA browser. Initially limited to the Sequence Read Archive, the ENA browser now also provides access to the Trace Archive and EMBL-Bank, allowing file retrieval in a range of formats including XML, HTML, FASTA and FASTQ. Individual records can be accessed using their accession numbers and other text queries are enabled through the EB-eye search engine. Additionally, sequence similarity-based searches implemented using De Bruijn graphs offer another method of retrieving records from the ENA.
The ENA is accessible via the EBI SOAP and REST APIs, which also offer access to other databases hosted at the EBI, such as Ensembl and InterPro.
Storage.
The European Nucleotide Archive handles large volumes of data which pose a significant storage challenge. As of 2012, the ENA's storage requirements continue to grow exponentially, with a doubling time of approximately 10 months. To manage this increase, the ENA selectively discards less-valuable sequencing platform data and implements advanced compression strategies. The CRAM reference-based compression toolkit was developed to help reduce ENA storage requirements.
Funding.
Currently the ENA is funded jointly by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, the European Commission and the Wellcome Trust. The emerging ELIXIR framework, coordinated by EBI director Janet Thornton, aims to secure a sustainable European funding infrastructure to support the continued availability of life science databases such as the ENA.

Steve Lee is an English songwriter/vocalist/musician and Ivor Novello judge. He has written for artists worldwide and had numerous international hits.
In the mid-1980s, as a lead vocalist, he worked on an original project with Anne Dudley (Art Of Noise) but failed to secure a record deal. In 1985, as a sax player, he toured with the band B-Movie. He then fronted the band Krew, comprising mainly Nik Kershaw's band, and released the single ‘Paper Heroes’ on WEA Records in April 1986, written by Tim Moore, Dennis Smith and Lee. The band was short lived however, and from there he toured with The Duel as a sax player, supporting 5 Star on their British tour of 1987.
In 1988 Lee signed to IRS Records with writing/production partner Gary Miller as Big Smile and released one single, ‘Crocodile Tears’ - remixed by William Orbit - after which they split. Steve returned to session work, including providing backing vocals on Diane Tell’s French album ‘Degriffe-Moi’. For the whole of 1989 Steve toured with Then Jerico as backing vocalist/alto sax player after which he was recruited by Joan Armatrading for her UK and American tour of 1990, playing alto and tenor sax, guitar, percussion and backing vocals. As an addition to the tour, they headlined at the King’s Trust Concert in Swaziland.
In 1991, in partnership with Simon Ellis, he wrote and produced the single ‘People Of The World’ by Sorell Johnson – a Gary Davies’ Radio 1 Record Of The Week – and wrote ‘Crying In The Rain’ for Randy Crawford with Judy Cheeks. During this period Lee worked as a session musician, playing sax and/or backing vocals for Kym Mazelle, Jaki Graham, Jason Donovan, Nick Berry and the DJ Sasha. Steve then produced and co-wrote the single ‘D’Jilawendie’ for Portuguese singer Teresa Maiuko, for whom he was also bassist and Musical Director on her Portuguese tour of 1993. It was also in this year that Jason Donovan released ‘Shout About’ written by Lee and Dina Taylor.
In August 1993 he signed to PWL Records as FKW, releasing an Italian House version of ‘Never Gonna Give You Up’ and ‘Seize The Day’, reaching Number 1 in the Dance Charts. In February 1994, ‘Jingo’ peaked at number 15 and was also was a major club hit. Two further singles followed, ‘This Is The Way’ and ‘Laura Palmer’s Theme’ and Lee was voted PA Of The Year by Disco International. In 1995 he replaced Tony Jackson as lead singer with Rage, releasing one single, ‘My Crying’s Done’.
In 1997 Steve formed the studio band Franklyn with Steve Torch, later recruiting Sarah Brown of the London Community Gospel Choir on vocals. Fusing drum’n’bass and trip hop, the band signed with Jammin’ Records the following year and released the album ‘What’s My Name?’ in 1999, produced by Lee.
From 2000 onwards Steve focussed almost entirely on writing for other artists, including Britney Spears, Christina Milian, Girls Aloud and Nick Carter (see discography below). His song ‘Love Will Set You Free’ released by Starchaser on Ministry of Sound, also featured Steve’s lead vocal, and was a No1 Dance single. During this period he also provided backing vocals for several artists including Lionel Richie, Enrique Iglesias and Lil Wayne.
His song ‘Friday’s Child’, released as a single by Will Young in 2004, was nominated for an Ivor Novello and Steve himself was a judge on the Ivor Novello panel for Best Contemporary Song in 2006.

Robert S. Rivkin

Robert S. Rivkin is the Senior Vice President and Deputy General Counsel of Delta Air Lines for Regulatory and International Affairs. Until April 2013, he was the 21st General Counsel of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT). Appointed by President Barack Obama, Rivkin was sworn in on May 18, 2009, following unanimous confirmation by the United States Senate. In addition to serving as DOT’s chief legal officer, Rivkin has played a key role in a number of programs and initiatives including the Cash for Clunkers program and the Toyota vehicle recalls.
Career.
Early work.
Rivkin, a lawyer, has worked in private practice and public service. He has served as a director of the Chicago-based Metropolitan Planning Council and of the Illinois Chamber of Commerce. He was also an Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, Director of Programs and Policies for the City of Chicago Law Department, and a partner at a Chicago-based law firm.
Chicago Transit Authority and Aon Corp.
In 2001, Rivkin joined the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) as General Counsel, overseeing the legal operations of the second largest mass transit system in the country. Rivkin was “instrumental” in acquiring $530 million to expand the CTA Brown Line, which was facing a 10% increase in ridership. The project was the costliest CTA expansion ever at the time.
In 2004, Rivkin left the CTA to join then-Chicago-based Aon Corporation as Vice President and Deputy General Counsel. He stayed in that position until he was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2009.
Department of Transportation.
Appointed by President Barack Obama, Rivkin was sworn in on May 18, 2009, following unanimous confirmation by the United States Senate. A longtime Obama supporter and contributor, Rivkin first met Obama in 1991.
In 2009, Rivkin was put in charge of the "Cash for Clunkers" automotive rebate program, a $3 billion U.S. federal scrappage program intended to provide economic incentives to U.S. residents to purchase a new, more fuel-efficient vehicle when trading in a less fuel-efficient vehicle. The program was promoted as providing economic stimulus by boosting car sales, while putting safer, cleaner, and more fuel-efficient vehicles on the road. The department was given an unusually short period of time to plan and develop the program.
Under Rivkin’s leadership, DOT issued new traveler protection rules requiring airlines to let customers off planes stuck on the tarmac for three hours. Critics of the rule have argued that it has resulted in "more delays and more flight cancellations".
The rules also increased compensation for involuntarily delayed (or "bumped") passengers, required airlines to advertise their full fares, including any mandatory taxes, fees, or airline charges, and expanded the new tarmac regulations to cover international flights. Rivkin noted that “fees serve only to confuse or deceive consumers regarding the true full price of the ticket and to make price comparisons difficult”. Spirit Airlines, Allegiant Air, and Southwest Airlines filed a lawsuit against the rule in November 2011, arguing that it violated their First Amendment right to freedom of speech and that the overtaxing of the airline industry is to blame for rising airline costs. Rivkin responded that “deceptive presentations that highlight a low "base fare" (such as the $9 fares advertised by Spirit that include neither government taxes nor Spirit’s own non-optional fees) mislead and confuse consumers, Spirit would be free to add the statement ‘fares include $XX.XX in taxes and government fees’ in all its fare advertising, provided it did so in a nondeceptive manner.” The District of Columbia Court of Appeals rejected Spirit's challenge.
Rivkin also led the department’s legal team negotiating a record fine for the violations that led to Toyota's recall of approximately 9 illion vehicles because of unintended acceleration.
On April 9, 2013, it was announced that Rivkin would leave the Department of Transportation and become the Senior Vice President for Regulatory and International Affairs for Delta Airlines.
Education, family and personal life.
Robert Samuel Rivkin was born on December 6, 1960 to parents Enid Hammerman and William R. Rivkin, the 3rd of 4 children.
Rivkin attended Harvard College, where he graduated magna cum laude. He graduated with his J.D. from Stanford Law School, where he was an associate editor of the "Stanford Law Review".
Rivkin's father, William R. Rivkin, was United States Ambassador to Luxembourg under President John F. Kennedy and United States Ambassador to Senegal and the Gambia under President Lyndon B. Johnson. His younger brother, Charles, is the current United States Ambassador to France and Monaco. Former "Newsweek" and current "Bloomberg" columnist Jonathan Alter is a cousin of Rivkin. Rivkin is the godson of former Democratic Presidential candidate Hubert Humphrey.
Rivkin married Cindy Moelis in 1988; they have two daughters, Stephanie and Claire, and a son, Alexander. Moelis is the current director of the White House Fellows Program.

Mabel Esplin

Mabel Esplin (1874–1921) was a stained glass artist.
Life.
Esplin was born in Chorlton, Manchester to a wealthy furniture manufacturer in 1874. He provided the financial backing for her to go to the Slade School of Fine Art and the London County Council (LCC) Central School of Arts and Crafts, which she attended from about 1906 to 1910 and where she was taught by Karl Parsons, stained glass artist Christopher Whall and stained glass artist Alfred J. Drury of Lowndes and Drury.
Although she primarily created stained-glass works, Esplin also painted murals. Her largest commission was for All Saint's Cathedral, Khartoum, Sudan.
Esplin was also active in the Women’s Suffrage Movement.
Career.
Murals.
Mabel executed 3 mural panels at Christ Church in Spitalfields in the East End of London.
Stained glass.
All her stained glass was made in collaboration with Lowndes and Drury at the Glass House in Fulham. Apart from work detailed below, The Stained Glass Museum have a sample of her work although they add that it may have been the work of Joan Fulleylove.
All Saint's Cathedral, Khartoum.
By 1912 Esplin had finished seven stained glass windows for the Anglican All Saints’ Cathedral in Khartoum.
In 1911 she was to design seven lancet windows and in 1912 lancet windows for the north wall of the north transept (The Gordon Memorial Chapel) which depicted St Edmund, St Theodore and St Sebastian. She also completed in that year a three-light window for the Gordon Memorial Chapel with the theme “Hope, Faith and Charity”. 1914 saw her complete a circular West window for the South Transept and a circular East window depicting “Death and Resurrection” and another three-light window in the Gordon Memorial Chapel with the theme “Fortitude, Justice and Wisdom”. In one window and in an attempt to introduce local colour, the figure of Balthazar was portrayed in the costume of a Sudanese Sheikh.
Due to her ill health, Mabel was unable to complete the Khartoum commission and remaining windows were carried out by Joan Fulleylove who had earlier worked as Mabel’s assistant.
Khartoum Cathedral was incidentally confiscated by the Sudan government in 1971 and the church's tower knocked down in October 1996. The Cathedral was turn into a museum which was opened in the year 2000. Fortunately the museum (The Republican Palace Museum) has left the stained glass windows intact.
English churches.
Mabel managed work for two English churches, St John the Divine in Richmond and St Anne’s in Lewes, Sussex. At St. John the Divine she executed two single light windows for the Chancel in 1912, one entitled “Spes” and the other “Mater Dolorosa”. She worked at St Anne’s in Lewes, Sussex in 1913 where she completed a single light window in the North Nave depicting St Anne teaching the Blessed Virgin Mary to read.
Personal life.
She was an active member of the Women’s Suffrage Movement and assisted in the activities of the 1909 International Alliance of Women (IWSA) Congress at Albert Hall in London.
In 1916 she was to suffer a serious mental breakdown and was unable to continue her work in stained glass. She died in a nursing home at Haydock in Lancashire on the 30th April 1921.

2012 Philippine Peace Cup

The 2012 Philippine Peace Cup was the inaugural edition of the tournament, four-nation international football competition organized by the Philippine Football Federation (PFF). It was originally slated for 12–16 October but the PFF moved it to 25–29 September to give way to the participation of local side Loyola Meralco Sparks in the 2012 Singapore Cup. ABS-CBN covered the games on Studio 23.
The tournament was due to be the third annual Long Teng Cup, however, the organizers, the Chinese Taipei Football Association (CTFA), begged off from staging the 2012 edition and requested the PFF to host it. The PFF then renamed it as the Paulino Alcántara Cup, after Filipino–Spanish football legend who played for Barcelona. It was again renamed to the Paulino Alcántara Peace Cup and eventually to the Philippine Peace Cup as the Philippine Sports Commission, which operates the Rizal Memorial Stadium where the tournament will be held, has a rule against events named after an individual. The month of September is also peace month in the Philippines and the tournament saw involvement of the office of the presidential adviser on the country's peace process.
After 99 years, the Philippines won their first international title since the 1913 Far Eastern Games.
Competing teams.
This tournament was due to be the third staging of the Long Teng Cup, all four participants of the tournament were to take part. However, Hong Kong have begged off from participating with Pakistan initially being mooted as their replacement. The PFF then invited Guam which they eventually accepted, thus replacing Hong Kong as the fourth team.
The four national teams that will take part are: 
Venue.
The tournament was supposed to be held at Panaad Stadium in Bacolod, Negros Occidental. This was due to it supposedly being more financially feasible and that renovations were going to take place from August to September at Rizal Memorial Stadium. However, at the end of August 2012, PFF president Mariano Araneta announced that it will be moved back to the Rizal Memorial Stadium because the project, funded by FIFA which will turn the football field into an artificial turf, didn’t push through. Araneta added that conducting the tournament in Manila will lessen the expenses of the PFF in the event, which is estimated at ₱6 million.

<doc id="36531678" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36531678" title="Kurita Chodō">
Kurita Chodō

, was a Japanese poet of the Edo period (1600-1867), regarded as a leading figure in poetry world in Matsuyama former Iyo Province.
Life.
Gotō Masanori, commonly called Teizō, was born in 1749 in Iyo now Matsuyama, and married into the Kurita family at the age of 17. The Kurita and Gotō family both owned prosperous sake brewery, they served Katō Kiyomasa, who built Matsuyama Castle. Chodō became the 7th owner of the brewery when he was 23. Around this time, under the encouragement of his wife and his father-in-law who were haiku poet, he began to compose his haiku. For his pen name, he took “Cho (樗). In Japan, Choboku (樗木) is commonly known as a useless tree. This is his expression of his determination to give up fame and wealth.
Besides his successful brewery owner and haiku poet career, Chodō performed an important role in the Matsuyama Clan. He was respected by many people. Even after that, he continued to make haiku and became the central figure of Haiku society in Iyo.　He built Kōshin-an in 1800 to devote himself to haiku activities, and retired from governmental service. 
Kobayashi Issa, one of the greatest haiku poets of their period, was an important friend of Kurita Chodō. Issa was younger than Chodō by fourteen years, and Chodō gave him guidance about haiku. Issa visited his house in 1795 and 1796 and they enjoyed composing haiku together. Their friendship lasted until Chodō’s death. In 1807, Chodō moved to Mitarai-jima, a small island of former Aki Province, now Hiroshima prefecture where he spent the rest of his days. He died at sixty-five in 1814.
Literary career.
Masaoka Shiki praised Chodō as the best poet of their age in Iyo. Chodō was widely known as a famous haiku poet Kato Kyodai’s disciple, having a connection with poets in Edo, Kamigata, and Owari province.
His first travel writing, "Tsumajirushi" (爪じるし) where he kept his journal during his trip to Setouchi, Kii, Yamato and Kyoto, was completed in 1787.
When Kobayashi Issa visited Chodō, they enjoyed making poems "Uguisu no maki" (鶯の巻) together. At the age of 50, he composed "Tsukiyo saushi" (月夜さうし). Successfully, he combined “grace” in "Tsurezuregusa" ("The Harvest of Leisure"), written by the monk Yoshida Kenkō with everyday reality. Moreover, in 1805, five years after his building of Kōshin-an, he wrote about his reclusive life in Kōshin-an in a journal "Kōshin-an-ki" (庚申庵記).

<doc id="36531763" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36531763" title="Ettore Petrolini">
Ettore Petrolini

Ettore Petrolini (January 13, 1884 – June 29, 1936) was an Italian stage and film actor, playwright, screenwriter and novelist. He is considered one of the most important figures of avanspettacolo, vaudeville and revue. He was noted for his numerous caricature sketches, and was the "inventor of a revolutionary and anticonformist way of performing". Petrolini is also remembered for having created the Dadaist character Fortunello. His contribution to the history of Italian theater is now widely acknowledged, especially with regard to his influence on 20th century comedy. His iconic character Gastone became a byword in Italian for a certain type of stagey snob. While his satirical caricature of the Roman Emperor Nero (created in 1917 and later the subject of a 1930 film) was widely perceived as a parody of Benito Mussolini, it may itself have influenced the mannerisms of the Fascist dictator.
Early years.
Born in Rome, the son of a blacksmith of Ronciglione and grandson of a carpenter, Petrolini attended theaters in Rome as a boy, improvising for fun. His first performances were on the sideshows on the Piazza Pepe. At the age of 13, Petrolini attended reform school as he bitterly recalls in his memoirs. When 15, he decided to leave home to pursue a career in the theater. In 1900, he participated in a show at the "Pietro Cossa Theater" on the Trastevere. Later, he performed in small, provincial theaters and in some cafés chantants with the stage name Ettore Loris.
Career.
In 1903, Petrolini began performing in Rome at variety theaters and café-chantants, where he provided parodies of renowned nineteenth-century actors, silent movie and opera divas, rhetorical addresses, and even of the variety theater itself. In the same year, when only 19, he met Ines Colapietro, who became both his professional and personal companion for many years, as well as the mother of his children. Ines, who was at the time only 15 years old, was hired as a singer by the "Gambrinus" theater in Rome, along with her sister Tina. Ettore and Ines formed the comic duo Loris-Petrolini, performing together until the summer of 1911. In May 1907 in Genoa, Ettore and Ines were invited by the impresario Charles Séguin to tour South America. They performed in theaters and cafes in Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, enjoying great success everywhere and becoming a household name in the capitals. While Petrolini was in Rio de Janeiro, appendicitis forced him to leave the stage for a month. After an emergency operation and a period of convalescence, his comeback was triumphant, with many theatrical artists giving up their pay in his favor. In a single evening, Petrolini once earned four thousand lire. After Rio, Petrolini remained a few months longer in South America. He returned for other tours in 1909 and 1911-1912, also appearing in Mexico and Cuba.
Back from a successful tour in South America, Petrolini was hired in 1910 by Giuseppe Jovinelli for his theater in Piazza Guglielmo Pepe that had opened in 1909 with a performance by Raffaele Viviani. It was a great success and, after two seasons at the Teatro Jovinelli, the "Sala Umberto" company signed an exclusive three-year contract with him. In 1915, he formed his stage company, the "Compagnia dei grandi spettacoli di varietà Petrolini", with whom he staged the revue "Zero minus zero", that led to the debut of one of Petrolini's most famous characters, "Fortunello", which was based upon a cartoon character. The performance aroused the enthusiasm of Futurists such as Filippo Tommaso Marinetti who called Fortunello "the most difficult to analyze of all Petrolini's masterpieces." Petrolini was so flattered by the admiration of the Futurists that he participated in some of their public events performing texts of Marinetti, Bruno Corra and Emilio Settimelli. The collaboration culminated in "Radioscopia di un duetto" ("Radioscopy of a duet"), a one-act play co-written with the Futurist writer and painter Francesco Cangiullo in 1918. The following year, Mario Bonnard directed a film based on the play, "Mentre il pubblico ride" ("While the audience laughs"), starring Petrolini (in his film debut) and Niny Dinelli. Petrolini developed an anti-Dannunzian position, something which was appreciated by the Futurists, and thus he put on exhibit during his variety sketches.
From the 1920s, Petrolini's repertoire was enriched with a series of plays by Italian authors such as Alfredo Testoni, Renato Simoni, Roberto Bracco, Luigi Antonelli, Ugo Ojetti, Salvatore Gotta, Fausto Maria Martini, adapted by Petrolini himself. In 1925, he took his stage adaptation of Luigi Pirandello's "Lumie di Sicilia", called "Agro de limone". In the 1920s, he also met Elma Criner, who became his companion and later his wife. In 1930, with the advent of sound films, Petrolini returned to the cinema as a protagonist of "Nerone" by Alessandro Blasetti, and also featuring Criner in the part of Poppea. The film featured some of Petrolini's most famous interpretations: Gastone, Nerone, Pulcinella. The same year he starred in "Cortile" by Carlo Campogalliani, based on the play of the same name by Fausto Maria Martini. The following year he starred in "Il Medico per forza", again directed by Campogalliani. In "Scenario"'s July 1934 issue, Petrolini has 94 close-ups, in a variety of poses, expressions, and emotional interpretations.
In addition to films, he continued to make many short versions of stage plays. Petrolini's work as a playwright became richer and more complex over the years: from the first macchiette (i.e. comic musical monologues caricaturing stock characters), to the successful one-act plays "Amori de notte" and "Romani de Roma" to the late comedies such as "Gastone", "Il padiglione delle meraviglie", "Benedetto fra le donne" ("Blessed among women"), and "Chicchignola". In these last two works, Petrolinian drama reached its peak, as irreverence gave way to more mature depictions, both bitter and compassionate, of human weakness. Now famous, Petrolini left Italy for a series of tours abroad, first to Cairo and the Italian colonies of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, and then, in 1934, to London, Berlin, and Paris. In Paris, he obtained what he considered the highest honor: he was invited to stage "Il medico per forza" at the Comédie Française, the temple of Moliere. He also performed in London at the Little Theatre, in Berlin at the Kurfürstendamm Theater, and in Vienna at the Komödie Theater, where his burlesque impression of Hamlet was considered hilarious.
Petrolini is considered one of the most influential figures in Italian avanspettacolo, vaudeville and revue. According to the "Encyclopædia Britannica", he was the "inventor of a revolutionary and anticonformist way of performing". He was famous for his many caricature sketches, and he developed a repertoire of caricatural characters of proven success, such as "Oh Margherita!", a parody of Faust (1907). His characters included "Giggi er bullo" (a parody of the leading character in a play by Gastone Monaldi) and Sor Capanna (a cantastorie inspired by Pietro Capanna, whom Petrolini called "my master"). Petrolini wrote: "Imitation is not art because if it were there would be art even in monkeys and parrots. The art is to deform." A characteristic of his art was the continuous reworking of the characters he created, giving them the profile and texture of real comedy characters. This was the case of Gastone, the subject of a skit titled "Il bell'Arturo" in the 1915 revue "Venite a sentire", subsequently performed on several occasions and developed into a tragicomedy, "Gastone", in 1924. Gastone was both a parody of the stars of the declining world of silent films and of singers of the time, such as Gino Franzi, with their repertory of dramatic songs lamenting sad farewells and unrequited loves. Another character that started as a skit – "l'Antico romano" – was "Nerone", who developed as a parody both of imperial political rhetoric and of the emphatic declamatory style of the "great actors" of the day.
Music played a key role in Petrolini's theatrical style and is an important ingredient in many of his comedies. Many of his characters sing songs and ditties ("filastrocche"), or declaim verses to a musical accompaniment. Petrolini was often an interpreter, and sometimes also the author, of popular songs of the day, many of which were released as records. One of the biggest hits of 1926 was "Una gita a li castelli" – also known as "Nanni" – written by Franco Silvestri and performed (and arranged) by Petrolini. His most famous song, originally recorded in 1932, with music by Alberto Simeoni, is undoubtedly "Tanto pe' cantà", which evokes an uncomplicated vision of life. The song quickly came to symbolize a way of life that was felt to be characteristically Roman – it was later recorded by many well known Roman artists, such as Alvaro Amici, Gigi Proietti, Gabriella Ferri and, most prominently perhaps, Nino Manfredi, who had a major commercial success with it.
Personal life.
In 1923, Petrolini was initiated into Freemasonry.
Petrolini's sympathies for, and impertinences towards, the Fascist regime were complex. Petrolini was admired and befriended by Mussolini, even though his "Nerone" caricature was widely perceived as a parody of the dictator. It has been suggested that the "Nerone" characterfirst created by Petrolini in 1917may actually have influenced Mussolini's own mannerisms. Although a public supporter of the regime, Petrolini did not refrain from satire, including a famously disrespectful rejoinder after Mussolini had presented him with a medal.
Forced to quit the stage in 1935 following a severe attack of angina pectoris, he died aged 52, in Rome, on June 29, 1936. The corpse, dressed in a tailcoat of his celebrated character "Gastone", was buried at the Cemetery of Verano. On 19 July 1943, during the first bombing of Rome, his tomba rectangular chapelwas hit, breaking the marble bust and severely damaging the coffin containing the remains of the actor.
Legacy.
Petrolini influenced future generations of Italian comic actors, including Alberto Sordi, Carlo Verdone and Gigi Proietti. His Gastone became a byword in Italian for a certain type of artistic snob and ladies man (and later for a man kissed by fortune, after the "Donald Duck" character Gladstone Gander was rendered in Italian as "Gastone Paperone"). In 1960, a film version of "Gastone" was released, starring Alberto Sordi. The film was directed by Sordi's old friend Mario Bonnard, the man who is thought to have provided the original inspiration for Petrolini's iconic character.

The game itself was influenced in part by Nicolas Winding Refn's 2011 neo-noir crime drama film "Drive", as well as "Cocaine Cowboys"; Refn is specifically thanked in the game's credits, and the game even features a similar "Driver" jacket lying on the floor in several levels.
Gameplay.
"Hotline Miami" is divided into several chapters, each of which is further broken down into several stages. At the start of most chapters, the unnamed protagonist wakes up in his apartment and listens to cryptic messages on his answering machine. These messages tell him to perform an arbitrary task at a certain location, which in each case is inferred as a metaphor for killing every person at that location, such as giving VIPs of a hotel a 'great stay'. Prior to commencing a mission, the player is asked to select an animal mask to wear, each of which provides unique advantages or handicaps. In each stage, the player navigates a building from a top-down perspective, and the goal is almost always to kill every opponent therein. Occasionally the player must also defeat a boss at the end of the chapter or find key items as they explore, but most levels are very straightforward. Some levels will also include hidden masks for the player to find along the way. The player has access to a wide variety of melee, thrown, and ranged weapons, and will need to handle challenges through either stealthy tactics or overwhelming force. The player character is no more resilient than the enemies, however, so any mistake is usually fatal. Enemy AI varies slightly, causing them to occasionally move unpredictably, making it difficult to plan a perfect approach. To make up for this, the game allows the player to restart each stage the moment they die, allowing them to quickly fine-tune their approach over several attempts. The game grades the player's performance at the end of each chapter based on a number of factors, also granting them points that unlock more weapons, and may also unlock additional masks depending on their score.
Synopsis.
Plot.
"Hotline Miami" employs an unreliable narrator and events are sometimes presented out of chronological order. The player takes the role of an unknown man; he is frequently referred to as "Jacket" by fans due to his distinctive letterman jacket, but he is never referred to by this or any other name in the game. He is plagued by visions involving three masked strangers who discuss Jacket's identity and his actions. The first stranger is a man who wears Jacket's clothes and a rooster mask ('Richard') and provides Jacket with cryptic questions and predictions, the second is a woman wearing a horse mask ('Don Juan') who expresses concern over Jacket's personality and well-being, and the third is a mobster who wears an owl mask ('Rasmus') and expresses his disgust at Jacket's behavior and often incites him to leave the apartment.
Jacket wakes up in his apartment on April 3, 1989. He receives a message on his phone about a delivered package of cookies and how he should read the list of ingredients. Jacket finds the package outside which contains a rooster mask and instructions to retrieve and deliver a briefcase at a certain location while eliminating everyone there. Jacket puts on the rooster mask and places the briefcase at the desired location. A seemingly hostile bum shows up, and Jacket brutally murders him before removing his mask and throwing-up. As the days pass, Jacket continues to get more of these messages and follows their orders. After each 'job', he stops at either a bar, pizza place, or video store. He finds the same bearded man working at each store and Jacket is given everything he wants free of charge while being indirectly praised for the murders. Following a voicemail directing him to the estate of a movie producer, Jacket rescues a drugged girl who was being sexually abused and brings her home. Jacket begins a relationship with this woman and continues to murder mobsters at the request of the ominous messages.
While clearing out a condo of mobsters, Jacket receives a phone call insisting he come to the phone company's office to deal with a 'prank caller'. When he arrives, he finds everyone in the building is dead except for a man wearing a biker helmet, investigating the company's files. The two fight. At this point, the story splits along two paths.
Jacket's interpretation
Jacket kills the Biker with a golf club before returning to his car. Following this difficult fight, Jacket's version of events becomes increasingly surreal and distorted, with the dead bodies of the men he's killed appearing around his apartments and the stores he visits after each 'job', although his girlfriend and the clerk fail to notice them. Jacket continues with his murders and almost gets caught when SWAT raids a building in which he was fighting. After his escape, Jacket stops at the deli only to find the body of the Biker on the floor. The clerk tells Jacket that "none of this is real," and with a flash of static, the Biker is gone and the man is oblivious to what just happened. Soon after, the clerk is found dead in every store he worked in and replaced by a bloodstained bald man, Richter, who is unfriendly towards Jacket and gives him nothing.
Jacket continues to murder people as the messages ask, until one day he arrives home to find his girlfriend shot dead in the bathroom, and a man in a rat mask sitting on Jacket's couch. He briefly acknowledges Jacket before shooting him in the head. The scene cuts to a grimy, darkened dream-state version of his apartment. Jacket enters his living room where he was shot and finds his corpse on the floor, with Richard sitting in the rat masked man's place. Richard says that this will be the last time they will meet, and tells Jacket that what he will do from here on "won't serve any purpose", and that he will never see the full picture. Jacket's clothes turn into hospital clothing as he walks across the hallway and into the apartment opposite, where he sees himself lying in a hospital bed. He falls to his knees and his head explodes.
Jacket wakes up is in a hospital with a police officer and a doctor discussing his fate. Jacket's injury was not lethal, but managed to put him into a coma for weeks. The police officer states that Jacket's girlfriend died and that they have the suspect in custody, but angrily asks when Jacket will awaken, as he turns out to be the prime suspect for the shootings. In spite of his injuries, Jacket escapes from the hospital and returns to his apartment, only to find it and his car ransacked. He changes back into his regular clothing and assaults the police station, killing everyone inside. He finds out that Richter was the man in the rat mask who killed his girlfriend. Richter says that he received the same phone calls as Jacket, but is unable to offer him more advice other than examining the police case files. After following more leads, Jacket is eventually given the address of the head of the Russian mafia.
Jacket arrives at the address and rampages through the building. He kills everyone there, including the mobster boss. Jacket heads towards the balcony, looks at a photograph and drops it into the darkness, and smokes a cigarette while the credits roll.
Following the game's conclusion, the player is given the opportunity to play as the Biker, who is revealed to be receiving the same phone calls as Jacket. However, he eventually becomes less willing to blindly follow their instructions than Jacket was, and attempts to end his affiliation with the group. Eventually his investigation into the source leads him to the phone company. After the Biker kills one to all of the unarmed workers and investigates the company's files, Jacket arrives and attempts to stop him. In this timeline, however, the Biker easily defeats Jacket after warning him to back off. The Biker then travels to the mob headquarters where Jacket originally killed the mobster boss. Spotting a janitor retreating into the basement, the Biker follows him and discovers a room full of masks and phones. It is revealed that two janitors (who are essentially creator cameos) have been setting up the killings. Depending on their actions, the player will be given one of two possible endings:
Regardless of which ending is obtained, the player may then kill the pair or let them live; an action which significantly bears no impact on progression through the game. The Biker leaves on his motorcycle before the credits roll a second time.
Characters.
Most of these names are unofficial because they were not named in-game.
Development.
The biggest influence on the game's story was David Lynch. Other influences on the story were the 2011 film "Drive" and Gordon Freeman from the "Half-Life" series.
Marketing and release.
Leading up to the release of "Hotline Miami", Devolver Digital opened a phone line in Miami, Florida to enable people to call and leave voice messages of their own. Some time after the official release of the game in late October 2012, a trailer was created using these recordings.
In early November 2012, an update for the game added support for gamepad control, multiple bug fixes, a few gameplay tweaks, graphical adjustments, and a new bonus map called 'Highball'.
By mid-December 2012, the game's publisher, Devolver Digital, revealed that 130,000 copies of the game had been sold in the seven weeks since it launched. In an interview at Eurogamer, project manager Graeme Struthers was "chuffed to bits" for Hotline Miami creators Jonatan Söderström and Dennis Wedin, adding that “those are some talented boys.”
In an interview with Pocket Gamer, Söderström was quoted as saying that his team had been talking to Sony about bringing the game to PlayStation devices – including the PS Vita – although they would require a third party to port it for them. The creators are also considering porting the game to iOS and Android touchscreen devices. As of December 5, 2012, the Twitter account for the game indicated that a Mac version is close to completion. The Mac version was released on March 19, 2013.
In mid-February 2013, Devolver Digital and developer Dennaton Games confirmed that the game would be coming to PlayStation 3 and PS Vita in the summer of the same year. The title would be Cross-Buy, allowing those who have purchased the game on either Vita or PS3 to play it across both platforms, only having to buy it once. The port was handled by Abstraction Games shifting from Game Maker engine to PhyreEngine and featured enhanced controls, an extra unlockable mask, and online leaderboards. These features were later added for existing PC owners as a patch. It was also revealed that, at this point, over 300,000 copies of the game had been sold.
On May 28, 2013, it was featured on the eighth Humble Indie Bundle as one of the games offered if paying above the average amount. The Linux version for Hotline Miami was released concurrently with the bundle as all Humble Bundle games have a Windows, OS X and Linux version available.
On the night of June 24, 2013, the PlayStation 3 and PS Vita version of "Hotline Miami" was released early, due to scheduled maintenance of the PlayStation Network.
On July 23, 2013, in response to a question on Twitter regarding if "Hotline Miami" would ever be ported to iOS devices, the developers replied "Nope. Controls would suck."
On March 24, 2014, Devolver Digital announced that the game would be headed to the PlayStation 4 with cross-buy support. No official release date has been announced.
Soundtrack.
The "Hotline Miami Official Soundtrack" can be found on Devolver Digital's SoundCloud account. It was later made available to purchase on Valve Corporation's digital distribution platform, Steam. Although the soundtrack is available for purchase, all of the music files can be found within the game folder in .ogg format (albeit often in edited versions).
Reception.
Critical reception.
"Hotline Miami" received positive reviews from professional critics. On aggregate review websites GameRankings and Metacritic, the game attains scores of 85.36% and 85 out of 100, respectively. Much praise was given to its neon-soaked depiction of 1980s underground Miami, overflowing with raw brutality and ultraviolent close combat as the player finds himself outgunned and using his wits to choreograph a way through impossible situations. The game's soundtrack was lauded for accentuating the already heightened tension and gritty violence.
Eurogamer scored the game 10/10, with reviewer Tom Bramwell saying that the game was a blend of elements, all of which are integral to the overall experience.
PopMatters scored the PlayStation 3 version of the game 9/10, reviewer Eric Swain wrote "Hotline Miami is still an introspective surrealist dive into the mind of a maniac who lives within the neon gloss of the late ‘80s. You still go around killing groups of thugs at the behest of a voice on the other side of the phone calls, which is somehow sufficient to addle you into killing everyone you find at an address that that voice provides. You still choose an animal mask to wear before entering these kill zones, and you still have a variety of weapons at your disposal to stab, shoot, and bludgeon your way through crowds of Russian thugs and the police."
IGN gave the game a score of 8.8/10 emphasizing its "striking blend of fast ultraviolence, a dense, challenging story and brilliant presentation." In its final verdict for the game, the reviewer Charles Onyett stated ""Hotline Miami"s momentum of mystery builds right up to its finale, where snarling cynicism is offered as a justification for why all this machinery of neon fuzz and thumping bass, bright blood and fractured identity was started up in the first place. Yet the justification is also disarmingly simple, the same reason why quarters were dropped into arcade machines built during the late '80s era Dennaton Games so clearly reveres. Why bother with "Hotline Miami"? Because it exists. Because it's fun. Because it deserves to be played."
Awards.
The game received the 'Best PC Sound of the Year' accolade by IGN in its end of year awards (2012). It was also nominated for the 'Best PC Action Game', 'Best PC Story' and 'Best PC Game of the Year', in addition to awards for the 'Best Overall Action Game of the Year', 'Best Overall Music of the Year' and 'Best Overall Game of the Year'.
It was the recipient of both Eurogamer's and Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Game of the Show award at their inaugural Rezzed expo. On December 24, 2012, "PC Gamer" awarded the game with "The Best Music of the Year 2012". At Machinima.com's fourth annual Inside Gaming Daily Awards for 2012 the game received the award for most original game.
Hotline Miami also won 'Best New IP', 'Best Gameplay' and 'Best Soundtrack' at the 2012 Vidya Gaem Awards, and received several nominations in other categories.
Piracy.
Jonatan Söderström has responded to complaints and questions on file-sharing website The Pirate Bay under the name 'cactus69', providing advice for users who are experiencing problems with pirated copies of the game. Söderström has made a post on Twitter admitting that whilst he does not want anyone to pirate the game, he can empathise with the fact that some people may not be able to afford it.
When questioned about piracy issues by Eurogamer, Graeme Struthers of Devolver Digital said "He (Söderström) just felt he didn't want people playing the buggy version of his game however they got it. He wanted them to get the patch. He basically said, 'I'm not going to criticise this, it's a fact of life. It would be nice if guys could find it within themselves to pay for it, but that's the world I'm in, so you know, you just have to take it for what it is.' It has been torrented to such a staggering level, and given the file size of it, I mean, you can't really be surprised, right? You could pass this thing around on the world's smallest memory stick. So it has been torrented to extraordinary levels."
Sequel.
In an interview with Jonatan Söderström and Dennis Wedin at Eurogamer, the creators shed some light on possible new future game content. When prompted with the question of upcoming downloadable content, the creators revealed "I think we're going to do quite a big project. It will probably be about as long as the full game, so probably we'll charge something for it. It will be like a sequel kind of, but building on the story. We don't want to reveal too much, but it will probably have more playable characters than the first game did. And a couple of different stories and angles. A lot of people have been asking about a map editor to build their own stages, so we're looking at if it's possible to do that. I think it would be really cool to let people do their own stages."
In late November 2012, Söderström tweeted "Working while listening to the sweet tunes of a preliminary "Hotline Miami 2" soundtrack that we've put together during the weekend." He later clarified that it was only really the music that he was dealing with at the time and that, "We only have some general plans for the next game". In terms of the new soundtrack, Söderström said "I'm not sure for the second game yet. Last time we had nine different musicians doing the soundtrack. Looks like a couple of them might do more tracks for the sequel, but we've been looking at some other bands as well. Want to keep it fresh."
Hinting that the sequel may be some way off, Söderström insisted that he was still committed to working on patching and fixing the original game. The official "Hotline Miami" Twitter released photographs revealing the title screen of the sequel, revealing its full title, "Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number". On June 19, 2013 the first teaser trailer for the sequel was released on the Devolver Digital YouTube channel. The game will be released in 2014.

Kōshin-an

History.
The villa was built in 1800, in the style of Matsuo Bashō’s Genju-an, by Kurita Chodō to spend the rest of his life peacefully and deepen exchange with haiku poets in Matsuyama. Chodō enjoyed haiku gatherings, tea ceremony and simply viewing the garden. Then he wrote about his reclusive life in this cottage in his journal " Kōshin-an ki" (庚申庵記). According to the journal, Chodō named his cottage “Kōshin-an” for the year of its construction, Kōshin.
After the original owner’s death, the house had been used to entertain guests by local people over many years. To match the needs of each owner, extensions and reconstructions are repeated. From then on, in about 200 years, the house had been abandoned and affected by natural disasters. However, local residents might struggle to preserve the place and refurbished it. The house still has original shape and atmosphere. Although the surrounding area was destroyed during World War II, the cottage including the garden miraculously remained. Be endangered for some years, a report by a student from Shinonome University triggered preserving and restoring the humble cottage as a historical valuable place, and in 2000, Matsuyama City decided to reserve and reconstruct as a publicly owned land. After the investigation and restoration with removal of extended section, Kōshin-an was restored much as it was in Edo era. In 2003, the house and its garden was opened as a historic garden.
The house.
The house was originally composed of three rooms with an entrance. One of the rooms was called “yojo-han” or four and half tatami mats, and used for haiku gatherings. The room is rather unusual that it has no tokonoma; an alcove where art or flowers are displayed. So there was no Kamiza (place of honor) there. It is because Chodō wanted his guests to be equal in the gatherings, regardless of their social status. Another room was “sanjo” or three tatami mats room which is used for tea ceremony and enjoying talking with friends. The “nijo” or two tatami mats room was used for his daily life. Thanks to the research of members of the house, it was found out that kitchen and bathroom were added onto the house, the entrance was modified. As for the rooms, relatively new materials are used in “yojo-han” and “nijo” tatami rooms, and it shows that these rooms were modified after his time.
The entrance and the garden.
In the entrance gate, The kuhi include a haiku by Kurita Chodō:
Originally, This poem was written in a hanging scroll in the house. Chodō took white ume blossom planted in front of the retreat Kōshin-an in this poem.
Wisteria, originally planted 250 years ago and provided shade in his time, is full bloom around the end of April. There is a stone statue of Jizō stands looking over the garden.

Aaron Margalita

Aaron Margalita or Margalitha (c.1663–c.1725) was a Polish Jewish Rabbi who later converted to Christianity.
Life.
Aaron Margalita was born at Zolkiev in 1663 or 1665. Becoming a rabbi, he travelled as a maggid in Poland and Germany, preaching in the local synagogues, and taught rabbinics for seven years at the University of Leiden. His friend Jacobus Trigland converted him to Calvinism, as Margalita explained in his "Oblatio Aaronis seu Tractatus de Passionibus Christi" (Frankfort-on-the-Oder, 1706). Travelling to Berlin, he denounced the Haggadah as containing blasphemies against Christianity, causing Frederick I of Prussia to suspend temporarily the sales of a recently published edition of the Midrash Rabbah, until a theological investigation had officially pronounced it harmless. With Frederick's patronage, Margalita became Professor of rabbinic Hebrew at the University of Frankfurt. He is said to have become a Lutheran at Hamburg around 1712, but to have later been imprisoned in Copenhagen for wanting to return to Judaism. He "died in prison, hated by his own nation for his apostasy, and deserted by those whose doctrines he had embraced". He died around 1725.

Information gap task

An information gap task is a technique in language teaching where students are missing information necessary to complete a task or solve a problem, and must communicate with their classmates to fill in the gaps. It is often used in communicative language teaching and task-based language learning. Information gap tasks are contrasted with opinion gap tasks, in which all information is shared at the start of the activity, and learners give their own opinions on the information given.
Examples.
One example of an information gap task is a spot-the-difference activity. Another is an activity where one student is given a picture, and must describe it to another student, who creates a drawing from the description. Further examples are students sharing information to complete a class timetable, and an activity where students must share information about their families and then draw each others' family trees.
Testing.
Information gap tasks are also used to test language ability. According to Underhill, these kind of tasks have the advantage that they produce concrete evidence of communicative competence, or of the lack of it, but the disadvantage of only testing the ability to communicate factual information. He goes on to say that with information gap tasks, care must be taken not to create a test which tests general problem-solving ability more than language fluency.

Pfinder is a computer vision system which detects features in video images in order to recognize human figures and their movements and gestures. Pfinder was designed by Wren, et al. of the MIT Media Laboratory in 1997. As described by its authors, Pfinder is a "real-time system for tracking people and interpreting their behavior". The system improves upon previous works by not only identifying the boundaries of a person in the image, but also analyzing the regions inside the boundaries and relating them to the known structure of the human body. As an example, Pfinder can track a person's head and hands, and can determine the pose of the body and recognize gestures.

Absolute Radio 60s

Absolute Radio 60s is a British radio station dedicated to music from the 1960s. Launched by Absolute Radio to complement its decade format radio stations, it first aired on 22 November 2011, debuting a week before Absolute Radio 70s. The station broadcasts through Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) on the Digital One multiplex in some areas of the UK, and is also available online, where it can be accessed using Radioplayer. Absolute Radio 60s was the first UK radio station to be dedicated solely to music from the decade.
History.
Details of Absolute Radio's plan to extend its decade-themed radio stations were released in October 2010, following the success of Absolute 80s and Absolute Radio 90s, the former of which was ranked eleventh in terms of listener numbers. Two new stations were announced on the same day, 18 October, Absolute Radio 60s and Absolute Radio 70s, both of which would be dedicated to the music of their respective decades. A holding website went live at absoluteradio60s.co.uk following the announcement, with basic information including the proposed station schedule. It was later revealed that Absolute Radio 60s would share some of the DAB multiplexes used by Absolute Classic Rock, with the latter reducing its broadcast capacity on each multiplex to make space available for Absolute Radio 60s. The 60s service began broadcasting from 22 November 2011 on various DAB multiplexes around the country and online. Absolute Radio 70s launched a week later. Upon its launch the station was more widely available than its 70s counterpart, airing on DAB in London, the north and west of England, and Scotland.
On 23 April 2013, the "Radio Today" website reported that Absolute Radio had removed Absolute Radio 60s and Absolute Classic Rock from several DAB platforms in England and Wales, but the stations continued to broadcast in London and online.
Format.
Although a separate entity, Absolute Radio 60s takes a limited amount of programming from the main Absolute Radio station, chiefly "The Christian O'Connell Breakfast Show" and the weekend "The Frank Skinner Show". The station itself is fronted by former Virgin Radio presenter Pete Mitchell, who presents an mid-morning programme, while documentaries on music from the 1960s are also featured. Absolute 60s plays a broad mix of music from the decade, although it tends to be geared towards the genre of music heard on Absolute Radio. Tracks typically to be heard on the station include those from The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Velvet Underground and Motown. However, other bands and artists who enjoyed success during the 1960s, such as The Searchers and Cliff Richard are not included on the playlist. During an interview prior to the station's launch, Pete Mitchell, who would be presenting on Absolute Radio 60s, stressed that the station would not adopt a "gold" format, but would instead play tracks by those who had had an influence on the musicians of the present day. According to "The Guardian" the Absolute Radio 60s aim is to combine "the "swinging 60s" with "the sound of young America"."

Absolute Radio 70s

Absolute Radio 70s is a British radio station dedicated to music from the 1970s. Launched by Absolute Radio to complement their decade format radio stations, it first aired on 29 November 2011, debuting a week after Absolute Radio 60s. The station broadcasts through DAB on the Digital One multiplex in the Greater London area, and is also available online, where it can be accessed using Radioplayer. Absolute Radio 70s went on air in November 2011, and was the first UK radio station to be dedicated solely to music from the decade, but it was followed a month later by the similarly themed Smooth 70s, which launched nationally on the DAB multiplex.
History.
Details of Absolute Radio's plan to extend their decade-themed radio stations were released in October 2010, and following the success of Absolute 80s and Absolute Radio 90s, the former of which was ranked eleventh in terms of listener numbers. Two new stations were announced, Absolute Radio 60s and Absolute Radio 70s, both of which would be dedicated to the music of their respective decades. Initially the 70s station would be available on DAB in London only, but would be accessible nationally and internationally through an online service. A website holding page was opened at absoluteradio70s.co.uk in line with the announcement of the station, which carries station information and an indicative schedule. The 60s service went on air on 22 November 2011, with Absolute Radio 70s launching a week later on 29 November.
Absolute Radio 70s shares the DAB slot currently used by Absolute Radio 00s, with 00s cutting its broadcast capacity (and switching to broadcast in mono) to release space for the 70s service.
At the time of its launch Absolute Radio 70s branded itself as "The UK's only 70s radio station", but was joined on DAB within a few weeks by Smooth 70s, a similarly themed station from GMG Radio which was launched nationally on DAB on 27 December 2011. However, in spite of its competitor, Absolute 70s continued to style itself as the UK's only 1970s-themed radio station. Smooth 70s subsequently ceased transmission on 6 October 2013, and its national frequency was taken over by Capital XTRA.
Format.
Although a separate entity, Absolute Radio 70s takes a limited amount of programming from the main Absolute Radio station, chiefly "The Christian O'Connell Breakfast Show" and "The Frank Skinner Show". The station itself is fronted by former Radio 1 presenter Richard Skinner, who presents an afternoon programme. Absolute 70s plays a broad mix of music from the 1970s, ranging from rock and punk to glam and soul. Artists and groups typically heard on the station include David Bowie, Kate Bush, Elton John and Blondie.

Zwingenberg (Bergstraße) station

Zwingenberg (Bergstr) station is a station on the Main-Neckar Railway in the town of Zwingenberg on the Mountain Road in the German state of Hesse. It has a heritage-listed entrance building. The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn (DB) as a category 5 station.
History.
The station was opened in 1845/46 along with the Main-Neckar Railway between Frankfurt and Heidelberg.
The plans for the entrance building were probably drawn up by the Darmstadt court architect Georg Moller. Originally the station was built as a two-storey building with a roof turret. Years later, an extra storey was added. Similarly, two smaller buildings were added. The main building is built in yellow sandstone and has three floors. The division between the floors is marked by red sandstone. The windows are also framed in red sandstone. North of the building is the old walled garden of the former station master.
Infrastructure.
The station is classified as a category 5 station. 44 Regionalbahn services stop in Zwingenberg each day.
In December 2007, Deutsche Bahn announced that it intended to sell the station building and shortly later that it had sold it to an investor.
A ticket machine is located only at the station building. Since the station is equipped with external platforms on the double-track line that are not directly connected by a pedestrian underpass, passengers heading south towards Bensheim or Heidelberg and who need to purchase a ticket must take into account the time needed to use the ticket machine and cross the tracks (about 8 minutes).
Operations.
The trains is served by the RB 60 Regionalbahn (stopping) service on the Heidelberg Hbf–Weinheim (Bergstr)–Zwingenberg–Bensheim–Darmstadt Hbf–Frankfurt (Main) Hbf route.

South Lake Michigan Conference

The South Lake Michigan Conference was an IHSAA-sanctioned conference situated in LaPorte and Starke counties. Started by 1931 (if not earlier) as the LaPorte County Conference, the county had only five non-city schools left by 1965. The league then decided to rebrand itself as the SLMC and add Michigan City Marquette and Oregon-Davis. However, continuing consolidation would leave the league unstable, and the conference was back down to five schools by 1969. The end came when two of those schools joined the Porter County Conference, leaving the three remaining schools to become independents.
The league can be considered a predecessor to the Northland Conference, which was started 23 years later by four of the five SLMC members at the time of its disbanding. That conference was also plagued by a lack of stability, and folded in 2010.

Enclosed Field with Peasant

Enclosed Field with Peasant is an oil painting by Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh, painted in October 1889. It is currently part of the permanent collection at the Indianapolis Museum of Art.
Description.
The painting's hurried lines accentuate a vibrant, moving field. The whole painting seems to pulsate with life, even though only one human is shown. It is the most topographically accurate of four views of a wheat field at the base of the Alpilles. Van Gogh intended this piece to be a pendant with the painting "The Reaper". Van Gogh's iconic style and layering embrace the canvas, making the viewer's eye travel all around the painting. "Enclosed Field with Peasant" is a great example of Van Gogh's late work, where his dynamic brush strokes take control of the painting.
Historical information.
"Enclosed Field with Peasant" was created during one of the most tumultuous parts of Van Gogh's life, after he voluntarily committed himself to an asylum in Saint-Rémy. He was recuperating from a nervous breakdown he suffered on Christmas Eve in 1888, during a visit with fellow postimpressionist Paul Gauguin.
Acquisition.
"Enclosed Field with Peasant" was inherited by van Gogh's brother, Theo van Gogh after his brother's death. He gave the painting to his wife, Johanna van Gogh-Bonger as a gift. In May 1905, if was sold to Paul Cassirer, and then to Robert von Mendelssohn. It was inherited by his wife, Giulietta von Mendelssohn, upon his death, and upon her death, was passed to her children, Elenora and Francesco von Mendelssohn. It was given on consignment to J.K. Thannhauser in New York, from where it was sold to Mrs. Caroline Mermon Fesler. Mrs. Fesler gave the painting to the John Herron Art Institute, now known as the Indianapolis Museum of Art, in 1944.

Angelo Tartaglia

Angelo Broglio da Lavello, known as Angelo Tartaglia (1350 or 1370 – 1421), was an Italian condottiero and nobleman, captain of the Papal Army, lord of Lavello and Toscanella.
Biography.
Born at Lavello, Basilicata, he trained under the military school of Ceccolo Broglia and served the Republic of Florence. On 26 June 1402, he fought in the Battle of Casalecchio, charged with overseeing the bridge of Reno but he left his position to participate in the combat, leaving the camps without any defense on his side. His imprudence cost the defeat of his army and Tartaglia was captured and imprisoned. 
Released, he assumed responsibility for the defeat but not enough to appease the wrath of Muzio Attendolo, who didn't tolerate his action. Since then, Tartaglia and Sforza got into bad relations and established a strong rivalry that lasted forever. In 1409, he fought in the service of Ladislaus of Naples, defending Perugia and Civitavecchia from the assaults of Braccio da Montone and conquering Rome, scaring away the antipope John XXIII.
As a token of gratitude, Ladislaus gave him the title of lord of Toscanella in 1413. In 1418, he swore allegiance to the Pope Martin V and occupied Assisi one year later and other territories between Lazio and Umbria. Tartaglia was arrested in his sleep by his rival Muzio Attendolo. After being tortured, he was decapitated at Aversa in 1421.

Lookout trees in Kaibab National Forest

The lookout trees in Kaibab National Forest are the survivors of a system of improvised fire lookout towers that used tall, straight trees as vantage points. The practice of using trees as lookouts was widespread in the western United States during the early 20th century, as there was no need to build a foundation or to pack and assemble a tower structure. Instead, a prominent tree could be selected, and a ladder or a series of spikes could be attached to the tree trunk. For transient use this could be all that was done, but for more permanent use the top of the tree could be lopped, and a platform constructed on the resulting stump. This railed platform was then outfitted with a seat and a platform for an Osborne Fire Finder. 
A Multiple Property Submission survey of lookout trees in Kaibab National Forest and Grand Canyon National Park in northern Arizona was carried out in 1987 as an addendum to a survey of fire towers in Arizona. Surviving trees with significant remains of their lookout function were individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places and were described in the MPS. Many of these lookouts were established between 1905 and 1920. Many more trees existed than were nominated, but the missing trees have either disappeared or were not located. No lookout trees were noted in Grand Canyon National Park, though some had existed. 
All were individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 13, 1992.

Grand Palace Hotel, New Orleans

The Grand Palace Hotel was a seventeen storey building located in the Mid City area of New Orleans, Louisiana, America. The building became known worldwide for its implosion on 22 July 2012.
Construction.
Designed by William Nowland Van Powell and Henry Ehrensing as the Claiborne Towers apartment building, construction started in April 1950 at a cost of $10 million. The building was the largest apartment complex in the city upon opening in 1951, containing 1036 air conditioned apartments, and was built on land leased from Tulane University by the developer Paul Kapelow.
The lobby was particularly well finished, including terrazzo flooring, wooden panels of black walnut and a bank of Otis elevators.
History.
By 1952, the building featured a wide range of facilities and occupiers, including a team of cleaners, a ground floor lounge, a beauty shop, lingerie boutique, offices of Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company and a branch of Walgreens.
Perhaps the most famous story from this period of the building's history is when the Jewish-American mobster, Phillip "Dandy Phil" Kastel, was found dead in his apartment by a private nurse on 16 August 1962. He had reportedly taken his own life with a .38 caliber revolver.
Construction of the Interstate 10 overpass adjacent to the building in the 1960s proved detrimental to Claiborne Towers' fortunes as an apartment block and it was partly converted in the early 1960s into the Sheraton Delta Motor Hotel, then in 1972 converted to a senior citizens' residence called Delta Towers. During the 1980s the elderly residents were evicted in preparation for the building's full conversion into a hotel. The new hotel, The Ramada on Canal, first opened, although at the time incomplete, for the 1984 Sugar Bowl. The hotel was subsequently known as The Crescent on Canal and The Pallas Hotel, before taking on its final name, The Grand Palace Hotel.
Closure and Demolition.
The building, like many others, was damaged by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 and never reopened. During preparation works for demolition, a fire broke out at the building on the 5th July 2012, at the time causing speculation that plans for its demolition may have needed to be changed. The main demolition of the building (after months of preparatory work) was by implosion on 22 July 2012, a story which was covered by many worldwide news organisations due to its speed of just 10 seconds. The implosion, previously scheduled for the 20th November 2011, then 18 December 2011, was undertaken to make way for the new University Medical Center, a replacement for Charity Hospital, damaged by Hurricane Katrina.

Harry Edwards (healer)

Henry James Edwards (29 May 1893 – 7 December 1976) was a spiritual healer, teacher and author who had a career of nearly 40 years.
Early years.
Born in London as one of nine children, Harry Edward’s father was a printer and his mother a dressmaker. In 1905, aged 12, Edwards joined the London Diocese Church Lads Brigade. In 1907 he left school and began a seven-year apprenticeship to a printer. Dissatisfied with that career, he developed political aspirations and joined the local branch of the Liberal Party, for whom he campaigned. 
On the outbreak of World War I in 1914 Edwards enlisted in the Royal Sussex Regiment and by late 1915 he was in Bombay en route for Tekrit, where he worked to build the railway track between there and Baghdad. He was commissioned in the field, and achieved the rank of Captain. In 1921 he returned to the UK and married Phyllis. The couple opened a stationer's shop and printing works in Balham, and Edwards tried to launch himself into a political career, standing for parliamentary and council seats as a Liberal candidate on several occasions, but with no success. By this stage he also had four children to support.
Spiritual healing.
Edwards became a spiritual healer when he attended a meeting at a spiritualist church in 1936 and was told by the mediums present that he had healing powers. His early attempts at spiritual healing were met with success, and gradually his reputation as a healer spread and his services became more in demand. During the Second World War Edwards served in the Home Guard and continued to run his printing business alongside his now growing practice as a healer. Gradually, as his fame spread, his healing took over from his printing business, which was later to be run by a brother. He moved to Stoneleigh in Surrey just after the war, where he used the front room of his house as a healing sanctuary. 
Eventually, because of the increasing number of patients visiting him Edwards outgrew this home, so in 1946 he moved his family and his healing practice to Burrows Lea, a large house with several acres of gardens and woodland in Shere, where he founded the ‘Harry Edwards Healing Sanctuary’. As his fame as a healer spread he was receiving 10,000 letters a week asking for help and distance healing. 
In 1948 Edwards held a healing demonstration in Manchester which was attended by 6,000 people. In September 1951 during the Festival of Britain he appeared at the Royal Festival Hall in London, where he demonstrated spiritual healing to a packed hall. In 1955 he founded and was the first President of the National Federation of Spiritual Healers (NFSH). 
An ‘Archbishops’ Commission on Divine Healing’ was set up in 1953 to investigate spiritual healing, and Edwards addressed the Commission in 1954, providing it with documentary evidence of a number of cases of successful healing for it to examine. At the same time he held a public demonstration in front of 6,000 people at the Royal Albert Hall to launch the ‘10 o’clock Healing Minute’. The Commission’s report, published in 1958, stated that neither the Church or the medical profession accepted the claims of spirit healers that they were responsible for successful healings. Despite the fact that Harry Edwards had appeared before the Commission he was never sent a copy of the final report.
Edwards claimed that several deceased scientists worked through him, including Lord Lister and Louis Pasteur. The founder of the Aetherius Society, George King was complimentary of his healing powers.
Harry Edwards died in December 1976 aged 83.
Skeptical reception.
A study in the British Medical Journal (Rose, 1954) investigated spiritual healing, therapeutic touch and faith healing. In a hundred cases that were investigated, no single case revealed that the healer's intervention alone resulted in any improvement or cure of a measurable organic disability. Edwards claimed he had cured about a hundred thousand people in Britain but Rose could not verify a single cure by Edwards. Rose visited a healing session held by Edwards and observed that an old lady had claimed to have been cured during the session and had walked without her sticks, but by the time the session was over was walking with two sticks out of the hall.

Aleksandr's Price

"Aleksandr's Price" is an independent psychological drama written, edited, produced and directed by Pau Masó. The film is set in New York City and stars Pau Masó, Anatoli Grek, Josh Berresford, Samantha Glovin and Keith Dougherty. Aleksandr is an illegal Russian immigrant living alone in New York. Traumatized by the death of his mother, Aleksandr struggles to make ends meet and ultimately turns to escorting. As he descends into the dark world of the New York sex trade, he must also come to terms with who he is. But will his search for himself and a stable home come at a price? Pau Masó presents this raw and darkly sensual portrait of a young man who's pushed to the edge of society and his own sanity. The film had "Simple Moves" as a working title. In France it is titled as "Le prix de l'innocence" (The Price of Innocence).
Plot.
"Aleksandr's Price" is an exploration to American youth in New York City and the excessive use of alcohol and other drugs in the gay community. Aleksandr Ivanov, played by Masó, falls into the dark business of prostitution after the loss of his family, which causes him to develop a mental disorder also known as Dissociative Identity Disorder.
Development.
"Aleksandr's Price" was shot on the period of 25 days in the month of March 2012 in the city of New York. Masó scouted the talent and locations. "Aleksandr's Price" released its official trailer in March 2013. The film tells the story of an illegal Russian boy in Manhattan who after losing his mother to suicide, is drawn into becoming a male prostitute. The film is set to be released later on this year.
Reception.
Critical reaction.
"Aleksandr's Price" has received mixed reviews. According to IMDb, the film holds a 7.0 based on 63 ratings, as per October 2013.
In September 2013, Victoria Alexander from "Las Vegas Informer" compared Aleksandr's Price to Steve McQueen's Shame stating the following: "Aleksandr’s Price can be viewed as a gay companion to Steve McQueen’s Shame, which also dealt with sexual promiscuity in New York City". She also stated the film to depict prostitution very well, saying: "Aleksandr’s Price is a gay-themed movie, its depiction of the cruel and shallow world of New York City and its commerce in young men and women of all sexual orientations is spot on".
DVD Beaver compared "Aleksandr's Price" to Black Swan and Requiem for a dream saying: "If Black Swan were a film about a male escort rather than a ballerina (and had a dash of Requiem for a dream thrown in), it would probably be something like "Aleksandr's Price" (although a bit more relentless, much more overblown, and without the hint of hopeful optimism).

John Fulton (instrument maker)

John Fulton (1803—1853), was originally a cobbler or shoemaker by trade. He built three orrerys in a workshop attached to at his home, now demolished, in the Kirton Brae area of Fenwick and was eventually appointed instrument maker to King William IV, moving to London, but retiring to Fenwick. He is buried in the Fenwick Kirk graveyard.
Life.
It is recorded that John's father, also a cobbler, was a subscribing member to the library set up in the village by the Fenwick Weavers and with access to this library, he pursued his interest in astronomy, mathematics, physics, and other disciplines that led to his career as an instrument maker of outstanding ability and achievement. Largely self-taught, he studied botany, learned several foreign languages, constructed a ‘velocipede’ or early bicycle, and experimented with the production of coal gas. He had left school at the age of only thirteen.
However astronomy held a particular fascination for him and led to his constructing, in his spare time, three working models of the solar system, known as orrerys.
Orrerys.
The Society of Arts, who awarded him a silver medal, calculated that his third orrery was the most perfect built up to that time. He built three orrerys between 1823 and 1833, the last of which is now on display in Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. This was the most intricate and it took him four years to finish it, measuring 1000mm x 3000mm x 3000mm. Entirely his own work it has 175 wheels and more than 200 moving parts. It is acknowledged to be one of the best in the world.
Fulton took the orrery on a tour of the United Kingdom. Such was the public interest that in 1869 a group of Glasgow businessmen led by William Walker bought the orrery for the city. It was brought up from London and then toured around Glasgow schools and museums until the 1930s when it found a more permanent home in the Old Glasgow Museum.
A local story relates that Fulton 'borrowed' his grandmother’s candlesticks, and melted them down and used the brass for his first Orrery model.
John Fulton Memorial Hall.
This is the public meeting hall for Fenwick, maintained by East Ayrshire Council. It was previously the Guthrie Memorial Free Church of 1844, and following a worldwide fund raising campaign sufficient funds had been raised by 1919 and the hall was opened in 1920.

Mirosław Chojecki

Miroslaw Chojecki (born September 1, 1949 in Warsaw) is a Polish publisher and film producer. He was an activist in the democratic anti-communist opposition during the period of the People's Republic of Poland.
Biography.
During the March 1968 events he participated in a student strike at the Warsaw Polytechnic, and was subsequently expelled from the university. Between 1967 and 1972 he belonged to the Polish Students' Association (ZSP). In 1974 he graduated from the Department of Chemistry of the University of Warsaw and then worked at the Institute for Nuclear Research (IBJ).
In June 1976 Chojecki was one of the participants in the campaign to help the repressed workers of Ursus and Radom. As a result he was dismissed from his position at the institute and went on trial along with Bogdan Grzesiak, and two printers from the Polish Trade Agency, Jerzy Ciechomski and Wiesfaw Kunikowski on June 12, 1976. In the same year he was among the organizers of the Workers' Defence Committee ("KOR"). He initiated independent publishing activity and was responsible for the reproduction of the "KOR Communications" and "Information Bulletin of the KOR" underground newspapers. 
In September 1977 Chojecki created the Independent Publishing House "NOWa" which constituted the largest publishing house operating outside official communist censorship, becoming its leader. Initially, Chojecki wanted NOWa to publish historical books on topics officially forbidden or ignored by the communist authorities, but other oppositionists convinced him to also issue works of literature, including those by Czesław Miłosz and Günter Grass. When Chojecki was arrested by the communist secret police Grass signed a petition demanding his freedom. Along with Czesław Bielecki of CDN, Chojecki was one of the most important publishers collaborating with "Kultura", the Polish emigre journal in Paris ran by Jerzy Giedroyc.
In March 1980 he was detained, and then went on a hunger strike which ended up lasting 33 days. In May of that year, the parson of St. Christopher's Church in Podkowa Leśna led another hunger strike to protest Chojecki's and others political imprisonment. This protest was joined by more than twenty members of the democratic anti-communist opposition, including Jacek Kuroń, Bronisław Wildstein, Aleksander Hall, Jan Józef Lipski as well the Hungarian oppositionist and publisher Tibor Pakh. After a trial Chojecki was sentenced to one and a half years imprisonment with a conditional suspension.
In August 1980 he organized the printing of publications of the "second circuit" (as underground press was known in Poland at the time). He was re-arrested but was released after the signing of the Gdańsk Agreement between the communist government and striking workers of Gdańsk, which led to the creation of the Solidarity Trade Union. Chojecki was restored to his job at the Institute for Nuclear Research as well. In the same year he became a member of "Solidarity".
In October 1981 he went abroad and was in France when the imposition of martial law in Poland by the government of General Wojciech Jaruzelski occurred. He remained in exile in Paris and published a monthly ""Kontakt"", produced films on modern Polish history, and organized support for the underground in Poland, including the provision of media equipment and other hardware. He continued to collaborate with Jerzy Giedroyc during this period. 
Chojecki returned to Poland in 1990. He co-founded the first commercial television station NTW (""Nowa Telewizja Warszawa"", New Television Warsaw), started a film group "Kontakt" and served as adviser to the minister of culture. 
He is the initiator and the honorary president of the Association for Free Speech ("Stowarzyszenie Wolnego Słowa"). In 2005 he was an honorary committee member for Donald Tusk during the presidential campaign. On August 31, 2006 Chojecki was awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta by President Lech Kaczynski.

GE Dash 9 Series

The Dash 9 Series is a line of diesel locomotives built by GE Transportation Systems. It replaced the Dash 8 Series in the mid-1990s, and was superseded by the Evolution Series in the mid-2000s.
Specifications.
The Dash 9 Series is an improved version of the Dash 8 Series. Like that earlier Series, it has a microprocessor-equipped engine control unit, and a modular system of construction of the vehicle body.
All models of the Dash 9 Series are powered by a 16-cylinder, turbocharged, GE 7FDL 4-stroke diesel engine, with electronic fuel injection and split cooling.
Dash 9 Series locomotives also ride on HiAdTM high adhesion trucks, with low weight transfer characteristics and microprocessor controlled wheelslip.
Six axle models.
Common feature.
A specification common to all Dash 9 Series six axle models is the AAR wheel arrangement known as C-C
C40-9.
This version of the Dash 9 was manufactured between January and March 1995. All 125 examples of the model are owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway.
The C40-9 is the only model in the Dash 9 Series to feature the standard cab design. All units have rooftop-mounted air conditioner units which gives them their distinct 'top hatted' look. Otherwise, the model is essentially identical to the wide-nose "North American" safety cab Dash 9-40CW (or C40-9W) model (see below).
NS specifically requested the standard cab and may have purchased more units had the Federal Railroad Administration not required it to purchase the wide-nose C40-9W version instead.
C40-9W.
All 1,090 units of this model were built for the Norfolk Southern Railway, as road numbers 8889 to 9978.
The orders for these units were basically an extension of NS's previous order for the standard cab Dash 9-40C (or C40-9) (see above).
They were built under the same premise that a lower power rating than the rating of the Dash 9-44CW (or C44-9W) (see below) would prolong the life of the engine, and use less fuel.
However, there is a manual override switch that allows the engineer to run the engine with all if necessary.
C44-9W.
The C44-9W model was in production between 1993 and 2004.
Of all the Dash 9 Series models, this one received by far the greatest number of orders.
A total of 1,697 orders for C44-9Ws were received from Burlington Northern / BNSF Railway alone.
Other large orders from North American operators were placed by Canadian National Railway, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and a number of operators that have since been absorbed by the present day Union Pacific Railroad.
Substantial orders for this model were also received from operators in Australia and Brazil, in the latter case for broad gauge versions.
C-38AChe.
The C-38AChe, also known as the NJ2, is operated by China Railways.
Built in Erie, Pennsylvania, it is based on a standard Dash 9-44CW (or C44-9W) (see above) and marketed as the GE C38AChe.
The model was specially customised for high altitude operation on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway route.
It is used on the Qingzang Railway, which connects Xining, Qinghai Province, to Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region, in the People's Republic of China.
Eight axle model.
BB40-9W.
This is a (meter gauge) version of the C40-9W. It was manufactured between 1997 and 2006.
All 141 examples of the model are owned by the Estrada de Ferro Vitória a Minas (EFVM), a railroad in Brazil.
The model is equipped with four B-style trucks, two at each end, replacing the conventional C-style trucks. The different trucks are necessary due to the railroad load limit per axis, which is 25 metric tons (±55,156 lbs).
The standard C40-9W traction motors cannot fit in the narrower trucks. To achieve the same total power, more of the smaller traction motors are needed.

The Mount Barker Football Club is an Australian rules football club located in Mount Barker, Western Australia. Nicknamed the Bulls, the club plays in the Great Southern Football League, with home games being hosted at Frost Oval ("aka" Frost Park) in Mount Barker.
Club History.
During the early 1990s both the North and South Mount Barker Football Clubs were not performing well. Two teams in a small town stretched the limited number of players. Members of the North Mount Barker Football Club (the "Demons") approached the South Mount Barker "Hawks" with the proposal that both teams amalgamate to make a stronger team for the town. Talks broke down and in 1993 the Demons were wound up and the Mount Barker Football Club was formed. The Hawks stayed on as a team but their coach and a number of players joined the newly founded Bulls.

XXXY syndrome

48, XXXY syndrome is a sex chromosome aneuploidy in which males have two extra X chromosomes. Human cells usually contain two sex chromosomes, one from the mother and one from the father. Usually, females have two X chromosomes (XX) and males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). The appearance of at least one Y chromosome with a properly functioning SRY gene makes a male. Therefore, XXXY only affects males. Males affected with XXXY syndrome have 48 chromosomes instead of the typical 46. This is why XXXY syndrome is sometimes written as 48, XXXY syndrome. It is estimated that XXXY affects one in every 50,000 male births.

There he meets the beautiful and idealistic young lawyer Edurne (Veronica Echegui), from Spain, who has finally escaped the clutches of her over-protective mother (Rossy de Palma). Edurne falls madly for Eduard, a handsome, sophisticated man that she can show off to the world. And Eduard is happy to go along with the situation, surprised at the level of affection he feels for this young woman. 
He might even call it love, "because love - c'est bizarre."
But then the attractive Richard (Teun Luijkx) comes on the scene, and is soon to be the focus of both Eduard and Edurne's attention. Will Richard turn out to be the glue that holds them together - or the wedge that drives them apart? And can they all, in the process, discover that elusive thing called happiness?

The key difference between the KNC and the SNC is over their approach to the issue of decentralization, with the KNC pressing for Kurdish autonomy, whereas the SNC has rejected anything more than administrative decentralization.
Several KNC parties have also on occasion come into conflict with another Kurdish group, the Democratic Union Party, or PYD. In order to reduce tensions, Massoud Barzani mediated between the two groups in July 2012 at a diplomatic meeting in Hawler. As a result, the PYD joined with the Kurdish National Council to form the Kurdish Supreme Committee along with a popular defence force to defend Syrian Kurdistan. Under the agreement, cities that fall under the control of Syrian Kurdish forces will be ruled jointly by the PYD and the KNC until an election can be held. Despite the agreement before the groups, there remain allegations from the Kurdish Union Party that the PYD has forced buildings run by the KNC, which fly the Kurdish flag, to replace it with the PKK flag, which is used by the PYD. The PYD has apparently been able to do this through intimidation due to the fact that unlike most other Kurdish groups, the PYD is armed, due in part to the fact that it ensures, at times forcibly, that no other groups maintain any significant armed wing like the YPG.

Kevin Elijah Burgess, better known by his stage name KB, is an American Christian hip hop artist from St. Petersburg, Florida. He is the leader of the hip-hop group HGA, and was signed as a solo artist to Reach Records in 2010. He is also a member of the Reach Records-based hip-hop collective 116 Clique. After releasing a mixtape in 2011 entitled "Who Is KB?", his debut album, "Weight & Glory", was released on July 17, 2012, to critical acclaim. On March 4, 2014 he released his second album, an EP, "100".
Biography.
Early life.
Kevin Burgess was born in St. Petersburg, Florida into a military family. Shortly after his birth his parents moved to Southern Illinois where he was raised for eight years. When he was 8 years old, his parents divorced and he moved back with his mother to the south-side of St. Petersburg, which according to Burgess is "probably one of the worst areas in the state." He did well in school and at age 15 was offered an opportunity to pursue college through a program called St. Petersburg Collegiate High School. But despite this opportunity, he struggled with extreme depression and experimented with various drugs to try to relieve it. He began struggling at school due to his problems with his personal life, and even contemplated suicide. During this period of his life he met a Christian named Jeremy who introduced him to Christian rap. Jeremy offered him a CD, and Burgess says he was saved after hearing the Gospel presentation on the recording.
Formation of HGA.
After high school, Burgess enrolled in Bible college and befriended a group of Christian rappers and together they formed a hip hop group called HGA, short for His Glory Alone. HGA eventually caught the interest of Lecrae, Ben Washer, and DJ Official, and were featured with Tedashii on the track "Go" from DJ Official's album "Entermission". Burgess was invited onto the “Acquire the Fire” tour by Lecrae, and was asked to join the Reach Records team just a few months later.
Signing with Reach Records.
Burgess signed with Reach Records in 2010, and appeared that year on the album "Rehab" by Lecrae. His mixtape "Who is KB?" followed a year later, as did appearances with PRo and Tedashii. "Who is KB?" garnered 30,000 downloads by the following year. His first single, "Hello", featured Suzy Rock and was released in October 2011. In January 2012, a second single, "Zone Out" featuring Chris Lee Cobbins, was released. Burgess then made an appearance with Andy Mineo on the Trip Lee album "The Good Life". A third single by Burgess, "Go Off", featured Tedashii and Andy Mineo, and was released in June. The following month, his debut album "Weight & Glory" was released.
On May 30, 2013, Reach announced a four-part project entitled "1st & 16th". This project would consist of Burgess releasing a new song every first and sixteenth of June and July. On June 1, Part 1, "HCB Freestyle" was released. The songs "Ride" and "Be All Right" were also part of the 1st and 16th project.
On February 10, 2014, KB announced his new project, an EP entitled "100", which was released on March 4, 2014. Burgess appeared in Family Force 5 music video for the song "BZRK", released on May 23, 2014, on which Burgess is a featured artist.

<doc id="36532646" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36532646" title="United Nations General Assembly Resolution 43/176">
United Nations General Assembly Resolution 43/176

The United Nations General Assembly Resolution 43/176 of 15 December 1988 was a resolution in which the General Assembly called for the convening of an "International Peace Conference on the Middle East", under the auspices of the United Nations. The resolution is titled ""43/176. Question of Palestine"". The peace conference was proposed in the framework of international politics.
The international community supported the "International Peace Conference", with only Israel and the United States opposing it. Israel and US insisted on bilateral negotiations instead.
The resolution affirms principles for the achievement of comprehensive peace: withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem, and from the other occupied Arab territories; security of all States in the region, including those named in resolution 181, within secure and internationally recognized boundaries; execution of Resolution 194; dismantling of the Israeli settlements; and free access to Holy Places.
In the same meeting Resolution 43/177 was adopted, in which the proclamation of the State of Palestine was acknowledged and the occupied Palestinian territories were called territories over which the Palestinian people should exercise sovereignty. The resolutions 43/176 and 43/177 were broadly supported by NGO's all over the world.
Background.
The UN held meetings on "the question of Palastine" from 13 to 15 December 1988. On 13 December, Arafat held a speech at the General Assembly. A month earlier he had declared the "State of Palestine". An accompanying "Political Communiqué" urged an "International Peace Conference". The "Political Communiqué", in which the PLO affirmed its commitment to the UN and its resolutions and reaffirmed its rejection of terrorism in all its forms, drew much positive international attention. The "Political Communiqué" also included a proposal to place the occupied Palestinian territories temporarily under supervisision of the UN, as noted in paragraph 4 of the resolution.
In a press conference on 14 December, Arafat emphasized the PLO's endorsement of Resolution 181 as the basis for Palestinian independence and Resolutions 242 and 338 as the basis for negotiations with Israel within the framework of an international conference. Arafat also affirmed the PLO's position, that Israel has the right to exist in peace and security and the absolute renouncement of all forms of terrorism.
Resolution 43/176 refers to Arafat's 13 December speech.
Key elements of the resolution.
Besides the call for an international peace conference, paragraph 3 affirms principles for the achievement of comprehensive peace:
Text of Resolution 43/176.
The General Assembly,
Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General,
Having noted with appreciation the statement made on 13 December 1988 by the Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
Stressing that achieving peace in the Middle East would constitute a significant contribution to international peace and security,
Aware of the overwhelming support for the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East,
Noting with appreciation the endeavours of the Secretary-General to achieve the convening of the Conference,
Welcoming the outcome of the nineteenth Extraordinary Session of the Palestine National Council as a positive contribution towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the region,
Aware of the ongoing uprising (intifadah) of the Palestinian people since 9 December 1987, aimed at ending Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory occupied since 1967,

2. Calls for the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East, under the auspices of the United Nations, with the participation of all parties to the conflict, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, on an equal footing, and the five permanent members of the Security Council, based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338 (1973) of 22 October 1973 and the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people, primarily the right to self-determination;
3. Affirms the following principles for the achievement of comprehensive peace:
(a) The withdrawal of Israel from the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem, and from the other occupied Arab territories;
(b) Guaranteeing arrangements for security of all States in the region, including those named in resolution 181 (II) of 29 November 1947, within secure and internationally recognized boundaries;
(c) Resolving the problem of the Palestine refugees in conformity with General Assembly resolution 194 (III) of 11 December 1948, and subsequent relevant resolutions;
(d) Dismantling the Israeli settlements in the territories occupied since 1967;
(e) Guaranteeing freedom of access to Holy Places, religious buildings and sites;
4. Notes the expressed desire and endeavours to place the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem, under the supervision of the United Nations for a limited period, as part of the peace process;
5. Requests the Security Council to consider measures needed to convene the International Peace Conference on the Middle East, including the establishment of a preparatory committee, and to consider guarantees for security measures agreed upon by the Conference for all States in the region;
6. Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts with the parties concerned, and in consultation with the Security Council, to facilitate the convening of the Conference, and to submit progress reports on developments in this matter.
Votes.
The resolution was adopted with 138 votes in favour and 2 abstentions. Israel and the United States were the only states that voted against the resolution.
Israel's objections.
Israel especially objected to paragraph 3, which affirms the principle of ending Israel's occupation, complete withdrawal and application of Resolution 194 regarding the Palestinian refugees. Israel also objected to 
the participation in the International Conference of the PLO, which was not acknowledged by Israel as the representative of the Palestinians, at the time. Israel argued that the conference would substitute, rather than support direct negotiations.

Southern Cross Feature Film Company

Southern Cross Feature Film Company was a short lived film production company that made some of Australia's most famous silent films, mostly directed by Raymond Longford. One of the key figures behind it was Sir David Gordon.
History.
The company was incorporated in Adelaide in 1917 and announced they would make five dramas and three comedies over the next 12 months. One hundred shares were offered at £1 a share. Their first picture was to be "The Black Opal" but this does not seem to have been made.
They offered cash for Australian stories.
According to Raymond Longford, they initially secured the serves of American director, Mr Walter May Plank, but he left Australia and Longford was called in instead. Their first feature was the successful "The Woman Suffers" (1918). which was followed by "The Sentimental Bloke". In 1920 the company paid out a dividend of a shilling per share.
The company was a subscriber to Carroll-Baker Australian Productions, which made movies starring Snowy Baker, and had a five-twelfths interest Southern Cross Picture Productions. Southern Cross Picture Productions Ltd was incorporated in 1920 with a value of £37,600 and directors including E.J. Carroll, Snowy Baker and D Gordon.
The company was at its peak in 1921 with the successful release of "The Sentimental Bloke" and "Ginger Mick".
In 1923 there was a trial involving a man who falsely pretended to be from the company to abduct a young woman.
In 1925 E.J. Carroll suggested the company make a film adaptation of C.J. Dennis's "The Rose of Spadgers" at £1,000-£2,000 but after consideration the company directors elected not to do this. By that stage the company was reporting consistent losses, due in part to its inability to recoup costs incurred in Great Britain and the US. It appears to have wound up shortly afterwards.

<doc id="36532781" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36532781" title="United States fiscal cliff">
United States fiscal cliff

The United States fiscal cliff was a situation that came into existence in January 2013 whereby a series of previously enacted laws would simultaneously come into effect. The Bush tax cuts of 2001, which had been extended for two years by the 2010 Tax Relief Act, were to expire on December 31, 2012, and planned spending cuts under the Budget Control Act of 2011 also came into play. That Act was enacted as a compromise to resolve a dispute concerning the United States debt ceiling and address the failure of the 111th Congress to pass a federal budget. Discretionary spending for federal agencies and cabinet departments would have been reduced through broad cuts referred to as budget sequestration. (Mandatory programs, such as Social Security, Medicaid, federal pay (including military pay and pensions) and veterans' benefits would have been exempted from the spending cuts.) The fiscal cliff would increase tax rates and decrease government spending through sequestration, and lead to an operating deficit (the amount by which government spending exceeds its revenue) which was projected to be reduced by roughly half in 2013. The previously enacted laws leading to the fiscal cliff had been projected to result in a 19.63% increase in revenue and 0.25% reduction in spending from fiscal years 2012 to 2013. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) had estimated that the fiscal cliff would have likely led to a mild recession with higher unemployment in 2013, followed by strengthening in the labor market with increased economic growth.
The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) addressed the revenue side of the fiscal cliff by implementing smaller tax increases compared to the expiration of the Bush tax cuts. Adjustments to spending were expected to be resolved in early 2013. Intense debate and media coverage about the fiscal cliff drew widespread public attention during the end of 2012 because of its projected short-term fiscal and economic impact.
ATRA eliminated much of the tax side of the fiscal cliff while the reduction in spending due to budget sequestration was delayed for two months. With ATRA's passage, the CBO projected an 8.13% increase in revenue and 1.15% increase in spending for fiscal year 2013. The act resulted in a projected $157 billion decline in the 2013 deficit over 2012, rather than the sharp $487 billion decrease projected under the fiscal cliff.
The raise in revenue contained in the ATRA came from: increased marginal income and capital gains tax rates relative to their 2012 levels for annual income over $400,000 ($450,000 for couples); a phase-out of certain tax deductions and credits for those with incomes over $250,000 ($300,000 for couples); an increase in estate taxes relative to 2012 levels on estates over $5 million; and expiration of payroll tax cuts (a 2% increase for most taxpayers earning under approximately $110,000). None of these changes would expire.
Around 2 am EST on January 1, 2013, the U.S. Senate passed this compromise bill by a margin of 89–8. At about 11 pm that evening, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the same legislation without amendments by a vote of 257–167. U.S. President Barack Obama signed it into law the next day. However, the budget sequestration was only delayed and the debt ceiling was not changed, leading to the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2013.
Background.
Etymology.
The term "fiscal cliff" has been used in the past to refer to various fiscal issues. The term started being used in the context of the expiration of the Bush tax cuts in 2010. In 2011, the term started to be used to refer to the deficit reductions that would have occurred in 2013 under a fiscal-cliff scenario.
In late February 2012, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, popularized the term "fiscal cliff" for the upcoming reduction in the deficit. Before the House Financial Services Committee he described that "a massive fiscal cliff of large spending cuts and tax increases" would take place on January 1, 2013.
Some analysts had argued that "fiscal slope" or "fiscal hill" would have been a more appropriate analogy because while the cumulative economic effect over all of 2013 would be substantial, it would not have been felt immediately but rather gradually as the weeks and months went by.
Legislative history.
During a lame-duck session in December 2010, Congress passed the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. The act extended the Bush tax cuts for an additional two years (until January 1, 2013) and "patched" the exemptions to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) for tax year 2011. This act also authorized a one-year reduction in the Social Security (FICA) employee-payroll tax. The reduction was extended for the 2013 year by the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, which also extended federal unemployment benefits and the freeze on Medicare physician payments.
On August 2, 2011, Congress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011 as part of an agreement to resolve the debt-ceiling crisis. The Act provided for a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (the "super committee") to produce legislation by late November that would decrease the deficit by $1.2 trillion over ten years. When the super committee failed to act, another part of the BCA went into effect. This directed automatic across-the-board cuts (known as "sequestrations") split evenly between defense and domestic spending, beginning on January 2, 2013. Also, the Affordable Care Act imposed new taxes on families making more than $250,000 a year ($200,000 for individuals) starting at the same time.
At the end of 2011, the patch to the AMT exemptions expired. Technically, the AMT thresholds immediately reverted to their 2000 tax year levels, a drop of 26% for single people and 40% for married couples. Anyone over these reduced thresholds at the end of 2012 would be subject to the AMT. Therefore, more taxpayers would pay more unless some legislation was passed (as was done in 2007) that affects the exemptions retroactively.
The fiscal cliff was finally eliminated at the very last minute during late-night and early-morning sessions of congress on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. During a 2 am vote on January 1, 2013, the Senate passed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 by a margin of 89–8. The House passed the bill without amendments by a margin of 257–167 at about 11 am that same morning. Eighty-five House Republicans and 172 Democrats voted in favor while 151 Republicans and 16 Democrats were opposed.
Key laws leading to the fiscal cliff.
A number of laws led to the fiscal cliff, including these provisions:
Without new legislation, these provisions were to automatically go into effect on January 1, 2013. Some provisions increased taxes (the expiration of the Bush and FICA payroll tax cuts and the new Affordable Care tax and AMT thresholds) while others reduced spending (sequestration, expiration of unemployment benefits and implementation of the Medicare SGR).
Some lawmakers had intended to attach a bipartisan extension to the expiring wind-power tax credit. Unlike the provisions above, this will "reduce", not increase, taxes by $1.3 billion.
Proposals to avoid the fiscal cliff involved repealing legislation containing certain of these provisions or passing new legislation to extend provisions that were due to expire. Different proposals were to include changes to some or all of the above provisions. For example, the Congressional Budget Office's "Alternative Fiscal Scenario" included only the first four items above. Changes to other provisions were sometimes included in such proposals, such as changing the original caps on discretionary appropriations contained in 2011's Budget Control Act, indexing the AMT exemptions for inflation (rather than capping them for one year at a time) or the wholesale or partial reform of the tax laws and/or the entitlement programs (sometimes called "the grand bargain").

The spending reduction elements of the fiscal cliff are primarily contained within the Budget Control Act of 2011, which directed that both defense and non-defense discretionary spendingIn 2011, discretionary spending totaled about $1.35 trillion, accounting for close to 40 percent of federal expenditures. Slightly more than half of the discretionary money went for defense. The rest of the discretionary spending funded a wide variety of government programs and activities, including education, veterans' benefits, public health and the administration of justice.</ref> be reduced by "sequestration" if Congress was unable to agree on other spending cuts of similar size. The scope of the law excludes major mandatory programs such as Social Security and Medicare. , Congress was unable to reach agreement on spending cuts and the sequestration was delayed until March 2013 as part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.
The effect on discretionary spending will be significant if the sequestration is not avoided. Cuts totaling $110 billion per year will be applied from 2013 to 2022, split evenly ($55 billion each) between defense and non-defense discretionary spending. For scale, discretionary funding for 2011 totaled $1,278 billion: budget authority of $712 billion for defense and funding totaling $566 billion for non-defense activities.
During 2013, discretionary spending would be maintained around 2012 levels due to the sequester. However, the spending begins to rise thereafter, but not at the pace projected prior to the sequester. In other words, the trajectory of spending increases is reduced, but spending is not frozen at 2012 levels. Increases in discretionary spending from 2013 to 2021 would be about 1.5% annually, significantly below the prior decade.
For example, according to the CBO Historical Tables, defense spending (including overseas contingency operations for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan) grew from $295 billion in 2000 to $700 billion in 2011, an annual growth rate of 8.2%. Non-defense discretionary spending grew at a 6.6% annual rate during that time, from $320 billion to $646 billion.
The austerity represented by the sequester is not unprecedented; from 1990 to 1999, defense spending actually declined by about 1% annually, from $300 billion to $276 billion, although non-defense discretionary spending grew by 4.5% annually, rising from $200 to $297 billion.
The CBO estimated the possible impact on defense spending in October 2011 testimony: "Compliance with the caps on discretionary funding could occur through many different combinations of defense and non-defense funding. For example, defense and nondefense appropriations might be cut proportionally relative to the funding that would be necessary to keep pace with inflation. In that case, funding for defense programs apart from overseas contingency operations would drop from $552 billion in 2011 to $538 billion in 2012 before rising again and reaching $637 billion in 2021 (see Table 3).
Between 2012 and 2021, such funding would be $445 billion less than the amount that would occur if the amount of funding for 2011 grew at the rate of inflation. When measured as a share of GDP, funding for defense would decline by about 1 percentage point from 2011 to 2021, or by more than one-fourth (see Table 5). Funding for defense in 2021 (excluding overseas contingency operations) would represent 2.7 percent of GDP; by comparison, annual funding for defense (excluding overseas contingency operations) has averaged 3.4 percent of GDP during the past decade."
The CBO estimated the possible impact on non-defense discretionary spending in October 2011 testimony: "If defense and nondefense appropriations were cut proportionally relative to the funding that would be necessary to keep pace with inflation, nondefense budget authority would decrease from $511 billion in 2011 to $505 billion in 2012 before rising again and reaching $597 billion in 2021 (see Table 4). Between 2012 and 2021, budget authority for nondefense purposes would be $418 billion less than the amount that would be provided if funding grew at the rate of inflation after 2011. Under an assumption that the obligation limitations for certain transportation programs grow over time at the rate of inflation, nondefense funding in 2021 would represent 2.8 percent of GDP; by comparison, such funding has averaged 4.1 percent of GDP during the past decade (see Figure 6)." Alan Houseman of the Center for Law and Social Policy has also argued that significant cuts to programs included under non-defense discretionary spending would harm low-income families deeply.
Loren Thompson of the Lexington Institute has noted that, as entitlement programs are largely exempt from the mandated cuts, sequestration would result in these programs assuming a larger percentage of the (reduced) budget, while spending on other programs such as defense would make up a smaller percentage of the budget.
Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus has said that continuing to operate under a series of continuing resolutions would be just as bad as sequestration, because these would freeze all programs at last year's spending levels, instead of allowing each program to adjust to its current situation. Also the CR is $4.6 billion below the proposed budget, which matches the $4.6 billion cut of sequestration. Should these both apply then the Department of the Navy would be almost $10 billion below plan. The Navy also suffers from congressional restrictions on shipbuilding and conversion which further strains their limited budget.
The military has already cut spending in anticipation of sequestration. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta compared this reduction in spending to a burn rate, as faith ebbed in the ability of Congress to resolve the issue. Even as the Pentagon has had to curb needed investments, the impact from government by crisis cost the federal government billions of dollars in inefficiencies and the resulting economic uncertainties may have cost the overall economy millions of jobs. Michael O'Hanlon blamed the negative growth at the end of 2012 on Pentagon cuts in expectation of sequestration. And the USAF has moved to shut down the Tethered Aerostat Radar System which has proved vital in the fight against the Illegal drug trade. The looming cuts have already impacted national security strategy with the February 6, 2013 cancellation of the "Harry S. Truman" deployment, which marked an end to the policy of keeping two carriers in the Persian Gulf region. Sequestration would also delay plans to equip F-35 fighters with B61 nuclear bombs that have been upgraded to JDAM levels of accuracy to give these tactical nuclear weapons strategic effectiveness.
However should sequestration come into effect, it would simply reduce defense spending to the inflation adjusted cold war average.
On 20 February 2013, Defense Department Controller Robert Hale said that rather than cancelling contracts outright, the DoD would instead use furloughs and simply not exercise contract options for supplies and services. Hale testified the next month and told the Congress that it was their actions that were preventing the Pentagon from making sensible budget reductions and therefore forcing furloughs of defense civilian employees.
On 26 March 2013, Obama signed a continuing resolution that would allow for reprogramming requests to shift $10 billion in funds under the sequestration limit, however civilian furloughs across all Pentagon budget areas will be required to meet wartime costs.
In May 2013, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno warned that the lack of training in 2013 due to sequestration had already impacted on Army readiness.
The sequestration mandated cuts in drug enforcement are expected to result in a doubling of cocaine imports into the United States.
Effects of tax increases.
Various sources have estimated the impact on taxpayers from the tax increases that would have occurred if the Bush income tax cuts and the Obama payroll tax cut had been allowed to expire with the fiscal cliff. The table below shows the dollar and percentage increase in income taxes for the 2013 tax year, if the fiscal cliff had taken effect.
</onlyinclude>
Each piece of the fiscal cliff would have had varying effects on people at different income levels. Low-income households are most affected by expiring expansions of the child tax credit and earned income tax credit. Middle-income households are affected most by the payroll tax and income tax. Households at the top income level are most affected by the income tax and the tax increases on unearned income such as capital gains.
Although European companies and investors will hardly see any direct taxation effects, corporate taxation of their U.S. subsidiaries may change significantly.
Congressional Budget Office projections.
CBO scenarios.
While Congress was debating actions to take to mitigate the fiscal cliff, the Congressional Budget Office provided policy-makers with projections of two fiscal scenarios for the years 2013 to 2022:
These painted starkly different fiscal futures. If Congress and the President did not act, allowing tax cuts to expire and mandated spending cuts to be implemented, the next decade would have more closely resembled the baseline projection. If they acted to extend current policies, keeping lower tax rates in place and postponing or preventing the spending cuts, the next decade would more closely resemble the alternative fiscal scenario.
Baseline projection. The CBO has been publishing baseline projections, following existing law, since 1985. Under the baseline projection (with the "cliff" occurring), tax cuts are allowed to expire and spending cuts are implemented in 2013, resulting in higher tax revenues plus reduced spending, thus lowering deficits, debt and interest for the next decade and beyond. Future deficits would be reduced from an estimated 8.5% of GDP in 2011 to 1.2% by 2021. Revenues would rise towards 24% GDP, versus the historical average 18% GDP.
The total deficit reduction or debt avoidance over ten years would have been as much as $7.1 trillion, versus the projected $10–11 trillion debt "increase" under the CBO's alternate scenario. In other words, roughly 70% of debt increases projected over the next ten years could have been avoided by "going over the cliff" and allowing the expiration of tax cuts and required sequestration expected at the end of 2012.
CBO estimated, under the baseline projection, that public debt would rise from 69% GDP in 2011 to 84% by 2035. In the long run, lower deficits and debt would have led to relatively higher growth estimates. But, in the short run, real GDP growth in 2013 would have likely been reduced to −0.5% from 1.1%. This would mean a high probability of recession (a 1.3% GDP contraction) during the first half of the year, followed by 2.3% growth in the second half.
Alternative fiscal scenario. If Congress had "avoided" the "fiscal cliff" by continuing its existing policies, the future would have more closely resembled the CBO's "alternative fiscal scenario". This scenario involved extending the Bush tax cuts, repealing the automatic spending cuts, restricting the reach of the AMT, and keeping Medicare reimbursement rates at existing levels (the so-called "doc fix", versus declining by one-third). Revenues were assumed to remain around the historical average of 18% GDP. Under this scenario, public debt rises from 69% GDP in 2011 to 100% by 2021 and approaches 190% by 2035. This scenario has considerably higher debt and interest payments than the baseline projection, but the short-term impact on the economy would have been avoided.
Projected effects.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that allowing certain laws on the books during 2012 to expire or take effect in 2013 (the baseline scenario) would cut the 2013 deficit approximately in half and significantly reduce the trajectory of future deficits and debt increases for the next decade and beyond. However, the 2014 deficit reduction would adversely impact the economy in the short-run. On the other hand, if Congress acts to extend current policies (the alternative scenario), deficits and debt will rise rapidly over the next decade and beyond, slowing the economy over the long run and dramatically increasing interest costs.
CBO estimates that if the baseline scenario is allowed to take effect in 2013, it would reduce federal spending by $103 billion and increase tax revenues by $399 billion (and another $105 billion "mostly in revenue") through September 2013 (the end of FY2013). This would amount to a net total of $560 billion, roughly half the $1.2 trillion FY2011 deficit. The White House estimates that a family of four with an income of $50,000 to $85,000 would pay an additional $2,200 in federal taxes.
The CBO has identified the following metrics for its baseline and alternative scenarios for the period starting January 2013:
<onlyinclude>
</onlyinclude>
Consideration of these scenarios and other options leads to what the CBO calls "a broad spectrum of fiscal policy choices."
Estimated deficit for the first year.
The CBO estimated that the total deficit of fiscal year "2012" (which ended on September 30, 2012) will be $1.171 trillion. The CBO also estimated that the total reductions to the fiscal year "2013" deficit by letting current laws take effect (which increase taxes and reduce spending) would be about $560 billion.
Therefore, since the total U.S. public debt was approximately $11.053 trillion as of July 2012, the public debt will climb by the end of FY2013 to either $11.664 trillion. 
Under current laws scheduled to take effect by the end of 2012, the total 2013 deficit will be $612 billion, as opposed to $1,171 billion for the previous year. The pie chart to the right contains a breakdown of the currently authorized reductions to the FY2013 deficit. The total of this chart is $606 billion but this is without considering economic feedback. Reduced taxes and increased spending, due to the 1.3% contraction in the first half of 2013, as well as other constraints, are expected to decrease the savings by $47 billion, giving a net total of $560 billion in deficit reduction during FY2013.
CBO analysis of policy options.
The CBO reported in November 2012 the economic and employment effects of various policy options related to the cliff. Each option has a different GDP and employment impact per dollar of deficit impact. In other words, some choices are economically more efficient. CBO explained why spending cuts have a more significant adverse impact on the economy than tax increases per dollar of deficit reduction: "The larger 'bang for the buck' next year of the spending policies under the alternative fiscal scenario occurs because, CBO expects, a significant part of the decrease in taxes (relative to those under current law) would be saved rather than spent."
CBO analysis of 2012–2013 ATRA changes.
The CBO’s August 2012 “Baseline scenario” assumed revenue would increase from $2,435B (billion) in 2012 to $2,913B in 2013, an increase of $478B or 19.63%. It also assumed spending would decline from $3,563B in 2012 to $3,554B in 2013, a decrease of $9B or −0.25%. The deficit was projected to be $641B in 2013.
The CBO's January 1, 2013 analysis of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) included adjustments to the Baseline scenario for 2013 of -$280B in revenues and +$50B in spending. This lowers the 2013 Baseline revenue projection from $2,913 to $2,633B, an increase of $198B or 8.13% versus 2012 revenues of $2,435B, while raising the 2013 spending from $3,554B to $3,604B, an increase of $41B or 1.15% versus 2012 spending of $3,563B. After adjusting for these changes, the deficit was projected to be $971B in 2013 instead of the $641B projected prior to ATRA, an increase of $330B. Both deficit projections were below the 2012 deficit of $1,128B by $157B and $487B, respectively.
Negotiations.
Democratic proposals.
On July 25, 2012, the Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate voted 51–48 to pass a bill supporting the President's tax proposal which extended the Bush tax cuts for 98% of taxpayers, while allowing them to lapse for the top 2%. The Senate also rejected the Republican proposal of extending the tax cuts for all by 45–54. The U.S. House of Representatives rejected, 170–257, the President's tax proposal on August 1, 2012.
During November 2012, President Obama expressed a preference for replacing the more blunt cuts of the sequester with more targeted cuts, while raising income tax rates on the top 2% of earners. Senior White House officials recommended a veto of any bill that: 1) averts defense cuts while leaving intact non-defense cuts; or 2) excludes an increase in tax rates for top earners. Obama wants to continue to extend the Bush tax cuts for American couples earning less than $250,000 and individuals earning less than $200,000.
As of November 30, 2012, Obama was calling for an undeclared amount of spending cuts, $1.6 trillion in higher taxes over ten years, and cuts of $400 billion from Medicare and other benefit programs over a decade. Obama also wanted "an extension of the 2 percentage point payroll tax cut" and spending of "at least $50 billion" in 2013 "to boost the economy." Although Democratic Congresspersons have in general supported President Obama's proposal, its November version was based on the President's 2013 budget proposal, which Republicans say was rejected unanimously in both the House and the Senate earlier in 2012. In March, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that the bill proposed by House Republicans for a vote "was a caricature of the President's budget, so we voted against it."
Republican proposals.
Congressional Republicans have proposed that the Bush tax cuts be extended in their entirety. In August 2012, the CBO estimated that extending these tax cuts for the 2013–2022 time period would add $3.18 trillion to the national debt relative to the current law baseline, comprising $2.74 trillion in foregone tax revenue plus another $440 billion for interest and debt service costs.
On December 3, 2012, Speaker John Boehner proposed a Republican plan that included $2.2 trillion in deficit cuts over a decade. Revenue would be generated mainly by reducing tax expenditures (exemptions and deductions) rather than increasing income tax rates. Further, it included raising the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 and slowing increases in Social Security costs by reducing cost-of-living adjustments.
On December 18, 2012, Boehner announced that a new "Plan B" would be taken up by the House. This plan would raise tax rates for those who earn over a million dollars. However, by December 20, 2012, he was forced to pull the measure when it became clear that House Republicans would not support it.
Other viewpoints.
Gang of Eight.
As of November 1, 2012, a group of senators, now being referred to as a Gang of Eight, composed of Democratic Whip Richard J. Durbin D-Il., Finance Committee member Tom Coburn, R-Okla., Budget Committee Chair Kent Conrad, D-N.D., Sen. Michael F. Bennet, D-Colo., Sen. Mark R. Warner, D-Va., Finance member Mike Crapo, R-Idaho., Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Sen. Mike Johanns, R-Neb., have been working since 2011 but " so far failed to reach an agreement after more than a year of talks." Because of the number of spending cuts and tax changes, at least half a dozen committees, such as the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance committees, might want to weigh in on the bill. Congressional rules allow bills to skip committee hearings, but the group lacks the clout to "push its plan through Congress outside the regular order of business."
IRS.
In a three-page letter, Steven Miller, then acting IRS Commissioner, outlined the effects of the fiscal cliff and said that the IRS is working under the assumption that Congress would "patch" the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). The patch prevents the AMT from affecting many more taxpayers. This is similar to what Congress has done in previous years. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated in August 2012 that if the patch were not implemented, federal revenues would rise by a total of $864 billion over the 2013–2022 period.
Federal Reserve.
On December 12, 2012, the Federal Reserve announced it would keep short-term interest rates near zero percent in an effort to lower unemployment to 6.5 percent. However, when commenting on the upcoming fiscal cliff, Federal Reserve officials "agree that the impact of the bank's stimulus campaign will be trivial in comparison to the consequences, and the economy will most likely return to recession."
Treasury.
The US debt ceiling became involved in the fiscal cliff debate when Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner introduced the President's authority to raise the country's borrowing limit as a part of his first formal proposal. Although not strictly part of the fiscal cliff, the current debt-ceiling will also expire around the end of the year, unless "extraordinary measures" are used.
On December 26, 2012, Geithner announced that the federal government would exceed the current debt ceiling on December 31, 2012. Therefore, a number of measures would be put into place to delay this from happening, starting with suspending issuance of State and Local bonds on December 28 and investing in two government pension plans. These and other measures would normally delay reaching the debt ceiling for about two months but, because of debate over the fiscal cliff, this might be extended if there is no change in the current laws.
Defense.
According to former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, the deep across-the-board cuts in defense spending required by the Budget Control Act will threaten military-dependent local economies and "do great damage" to American military strength and homeland security.
Others.
Many experts have argued that the U.S. should avoid the fiscal cliff while taking steps to bring the long-term deficit and debt trajectory under control. For example, economist Paul Krugman recommended that the U.S. focus on employment in the short-run, rather than the deficit. Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke emphasized the importance of balancing long-term deficit reduction with actions that would not slow the economy in the short-run.
Charles Konigsburg, who directed the bi-partisan Domenici-Rivlin deficit reduction panel, advocated avoiding the fiscal cliff while taking steps to reduce the budget deficit over time. He recommended the adoption of ideas from deficit panels such as Domenici-Rivlin and Bowles-Simpson that accomplish these two goals.
Other experts at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Carlyle Group have argued that allowing the tax increases and spending cuts to occur under current law may be necessary to create the "grand bargain" required to get the U.S. deficit and debt trajectory under control for the long-run. In other words, allowing current law to take effect would create conditions under which legislators might be forced to enact better designed deficit reduction approaches of similar or greater magnitude. Conservative budget experts have opposed calls to raise taxes or to allow defense sequestration, and have called on congressional leaders to return to normal budgetary process. Patrick Knudsen, a Heritage Foundation fellow, argued that lawmakers should seek long-term stability by rejecting short-term fixes and "grand bargains."

Partial resolution.
American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.
At around 2 am on January 1, 2013, the Senate passed a compromise bill, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, by a margin of 89–8. The bill faced uncertain prospects in the House of Representatives as Eric Cantor, the House Majority Leader, said on January 1 that he did not support it. The prospect was raised that the House would pass an amended bill, but it was determined to be unlikely that the Senate would vote on any amended legislation before the end of the 112th Congress at noon on January 3, 2013 (all legislation under consideration expires at the end of each Congress). The House passed the bill without amendments by a margin of 257–167 at 11 pm on January 1, 2013. 85 Republicans and 172 Democrats voted in favor while 151 Republicans and 16 Democrats were opposed.
The act contains the following provisions:
In all, the bill included $600 billion over ten years in new tax revenue, about one-fifth of the revenue that would have been raised had no legislation been passed. This would be the first year-to-year income-tax rate increase since 1993. The new rates for income, capital gains, estates, and the alternative minimum tax would be made permanent. The passage of the bill came after days of negotiations between Senate leaders and the Obama administration, with the final agreement being attributed to talks between Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Some Democrats criticized the bill for not raising taxes on the wealthy more, while Republicans criticized it for raising tax rates while not providing explicit spending cuts.
According to CBO, the total deficits for the 2013–2022 period would be increased by $3,971 billion relative to not passing the bill. CBO separately indicated in January 2013 that $600 billion in additional interest costs over the 2013–2022 period were not included in their initial assessment discussed above. This increases the deficit estimate to $4,571 billion. While ATRA would reduce short-term economic impact due to the cliff, it would slow long-term growth relative to the lower deficit Baseline scenario.
The table below shows the estimated impact on taxpayers from the tax increases that occurred with the expiration of the Obama payroll tax cut and partial expiration of the Bush income tax cuts. The estimated impact is given as an average for the different income levels. The baseline that is used is if the payroll tax cut had been extended, new health care tax not implemented, and Bush income tax cuts fully extended. Average federal taxes include individual income taxes, corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, and estate taxes as a percentage of average cash income.
Debt limit extension.
The sequestration fight was then expected to occur during negotiations over a debt limit increase that was expected to be needed sometime in February. However, on January 23, 2013, the Republican-led House passed a bill suspending the debt ceiling until May 18, 2013. The bill did not include any offsetting budget cuts, as Republicans had previously stated as a precondition for raising the debt limit. The move was seen as an attempt to delay a showdown on the debt limit given their experience with the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis, as well as the recent Democratic gains in the 2012 elections.
On January 31, 2013, the Senate approved and the House passed debt limit bill (H.R. 325) known as No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013 in a 64-to-34 vote. The legislation extends the current borrowing cap of $16.4 trillion through at least May 18, 2013.
The May 18 deadline is after the March 1 deadline for the sequestration, and the March 27 expiration of the continuing resolution funding the federal government. The bill also included a provision that would delay the salaries of Congressmen of any house that had not passed a resolution on the FY2013 budget by April 15, 2013.

Campaign for Social Science

The Campaign for Social Science was launched in 2011 to advocate social science to the UK Government and to the public, at a time of significant change in the higher education system. It campaigns for the restoration of the post of Government Chief Social Science Advisor, promotes social science in the media and on the web, and organises roadshows and other events to emphasise the value of social science.
History.
The Campaign was established by the Academy of Social Sciences and was formally launched at the House of Lords in January 2011, at an event that featured speakers including Trevor Phillips, Chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, Polly Toynbee, the Guardian columnist, and David Willetts, the Universities and Science Minister in the Coalition Government.
Structure and funding.
The Campaign’s Board is chaired by James Wilsdon, Professor of Science and Democracy at the Science Policy Research Unit, University of Sussex, and founding director of the Science Policy Centre at the Royal Society. Other members are:
Stephen Anderson, Executive Director of the Academy of Social Sciences;
Jonathan Breckon, Manager of the Alliance for Useful Evidence;
Dr Jacqui Briggs, AcSS, Acting Head of School of Social and Political Sciences, University of Lincoln;
Dr Will Davies, Director of Graduate Studies, Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies, University of Warwick; 
Barbara Doig, AcSS, former Scottish Executive Chief Researcher;
Professor Matt Flinders AcSS, Department of Politics, University of Sheffield;
John Goddard OBE, Emeritus Professor of Regional Development Studies at Newcastle University;
Professor Teresa Rees AcSS, Cardiff School of Social Sciences;
Ceridwen Roberts AcSS, University of Oxford;
Professor Neil Ward AcSS, Dean of Faculty of Social Sciences, University of East Anglia;
Diana Wilkinson AcSS, former Chief Researcher at the Scottish Executive. 
The Campaign receives no state funding, and relies on donations and sponsorship; among its sponsors are 49 universities, 23 learned societies, six publishers and two charities. 
Lobbying.
The Campaign has urged the restoration of the post of Government Chief Social Science Advisor, which was removed in 2010 when the role was downgraded and split between two people who also have other responsibilities. The Campaign made its case to the House of Lords Science Select Committee on Science and Technology, which issued a report in February 2012 calling for the post to be reinstated. 
Events.
As of December 2013, the Campaign had held 19 roadshows at universities around the UK to emphasise the value and importance of social science and to encourage support and donations. 
With the Academy of Social Sciences, the Campaign organised a conference on the 2011 England riots at Gresham College, London, in October 2011, and a public discussion on the future of universities, at the University of East London in October 2011. The Campaign held a launch for the latest booklet in its Making the Case for the Social Sciences, in November 2013, on mental wellbeing; speakers including Professor Lord Richard Layard and Andy Burnham, Shadow Secretary of State for Health. 
Publicity.
The Campaign promotes social science in the media, with letters and articles published in the Times Higher Education magazine and The Guardian newspaper on issues such as the Chief Social Science Advisor and the need for closer relations between social scientists and government. 
In October 2013 the Campaign released a report saying that social science graduates had a higher employment rate 3.5 years after the end of their degrees than did science or arts-humanities graduates.

Tomorrow Never Knows (The Beatles album)

Tomorrow Never Knows is a compilation album of songs by the English rock group The Beatles. Released through the iTunes Store, the compilation is intended to highlight the band's influence on the history of rock music, and includes several tributes from contemporary rock acts praising the band.
Release.
Released on 24 July 2012 as an iTunes Store exclusive in partnership with EMI Records, The Beatles' own Apple Corps and with approval from Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr as well as the Board of Directors representing the estates of John Lennon and George Harrison. The album intends to bring together The Beatles' most influential rock songs. It is named after the "Revolver" track "Tomorrow Never Knows", which is featured on the compilation.
Influence on rock music.
Quotes from contemporary rock musicians accompanied the release. Ex-Nirvana drummer and Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl wrote, "If it weren't for the Beatles I would not be a musician. It's as simple as that." Citing the gritty distorted guitar, rolling bass line, Ringo's drum fills and the groove of the song "Hey Bulldog", Grohl describes it as "a quintessential Beatles rocker ... raw and real."
Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park wrote, "Nearly everything my band knows about how to approach recording a song is attached to the Beatles in some way."
Win Butler of Arcade Fire said "There is a straight line from James Brown to death metal and it runs through "Helter Skelter." The primal edge to the singing on certain Beatles songs was present all along—from "Twist and Shout" onwards. It's that edge in the voice that, to me, makes rock n' roll. I've always thought of them as heavy."
Adam Levine of Maroon 5—"The Beatles are a massive part of who I am. My mother lived and breathed The Beatles and they were a huge part of my upbringing. Every time we went anywhere The Beatles were playing on the stereo. That seeped into my consciousness and completely shaped my musical style."
Ben Bridwell from Band of Horses—"Cheers to all involved on this track ["She Said She Said"]. Ringo Starr should be commended for the absolutely mental drums playing. The time signature alone is difficult to understand but to think of this performance being captured boggles my mind."

<doc id="36532828" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36532828" title="Tbf5 protein domain">
Tbf5 protein domain

In molecular biology, this protein domain represents Tbf5 which stands for TTDA subunit of TFIIH basal transcription factor complex (also known as subunit 5 of RNA polymerase II transcription factor B), and Rex1 a type of nucleotide excision repair (NER) proteins. Nucleotide excision repair is a major pathway for repairing UV light-induced DNA damage in most organisms. The function of this protein is to aid transcription.
Structure.
These proteins have a structural motif consisting of a 2-layer sandwich structure with an alpha/beta plait topology.
TFIIH.
Transcription/repair factor IIH (TFIIH) is essential for RNA polymerase II transcription and nucleotide excision repair. The TFIIH complex consists of ten subunits:
TTDA is also required for the stability of the TFIIH complex and for the presence of normal levels of TFIIH in the cell. TFIIH is one of five general transcription factors (GTFs) that assemble with RNA polymerase IIat a promoter site prior to the initiation of transcription. It is one of ten subunits that complete part of the 10 subunit protein complex (holoTFIIH) and part of a six-subunit complex of Rad3, Tfb1, Tfb2, Tfb4, Tfb5, and Ssl1 (referred to as core) 
Function.
In humans, the function of Tbf5 is clear, as loss of it leads to trichothiosystropy. Defects in GTF2H5 cause the disease trichothiodystrophy (TTD), therefore GTF2H5 (general transcription factor 2H subunit 5) is also known as the TTD group A (TTDA) subunit (and as Tfb5). The TTDA subunit is responsible for the DNA repair function of the complex. TTDA is present both bound to TFIIH, and as a free fraction that shuffles between the cytoplasm and nucleus; induction of NER-type DNA lesions shifts the balance towards TTDA's more stable association with TFIIH.
REX1, which is short for, required for excision 1, is required for DNA repair in the single-celled, photosynthetic algae "Chlamydomonas reinhardtii", and has homologues in other eukaryotes.

Venturicidin

Venturicidins (also known as aabomycins) are a group of antifungal compounds. The first member of this class was isolated from "Streptomyces" bacteria in 1961. Additional members of this class were subsequently isolated and characterized. An antifungal substance "aabomycin A" was isolated from "Streptomyces" in 1969. However, in 1990 it was reported that aabomycin A is actually a 3:1 mixture of two related components, which were then named aabomycin A1 and aabomycin A2. The structures of these were shown to be identical with those of the previously characterized compounds venturicidin A and venturicidin B, respectively.
Venturicidins are active against "Pyricularia oryzae" and "Trichophyton" species.

Laraghbryan is the site of an old monastic settlement, cemetery and ruined church, west of Maynooth, Co Kildare, Ireland. It is the site of a graveyard which is in use by the Roman Catholic Parish of Maynooth. The ruined church consists of a nave and chancel with a tower attached, most of the ruined structure was part of a church built in Norman times, however this church was built on the site of a previous ecclesiastical settlement.
In 1770 when the first Duke of Leinster restored Saint Mary's Church of Ireland in Maynooth, the wooden East Window was removed from Laraghbryan and installed in Saint Mary's, where it is today.
Laraghbryan Cemetery.
While most of the burials in the graveyard were from the 19th century, in the 20th century it usage was increased by the maynooth parish. There is a wall separating the old graveyard and new cemetery however burials still take place in the old graveyard. Prior to the opening of the College Cemetery in Maynooth, in 1817, a number of professors of the college were buried here
Rev. Charles Lovelock, Rev Clotworthy Augustine McCormick (d 1807) and Rev Edward Ferris.
The Baronet Sir William Talbot BL, MP (for Meath 1613-1615) and a freeman of Dublin, was buried here in 1634.

IFTTT

IFTTT (pronunciation: "ift" as in "gift" short for "If This Then That") is a service that enables users to connect different web applications (e.g., Facebook, Evernote, Weather, Dropbox, etc.) together through simple conditional statements known as "Recipes". IFTTT was developed by Linden Tibbets and launched in 2010.
General.
IFTTT enables users to create and share "Recipes" that fit the statement: "if this then that". The “this” part of a Recipe is called a Trigger. Some example Triggers are “I’m tagged in a photo on Facebook” or “I check in on Foursquare”. The “that” part of a Recipe is called an Action. Some example Actions are “send me a text message” or “create a status message on Facebook”. The combination of a Trigger and an Action from a user's active channels are called Recipes. The service offers Triggers and Actions for 92 channels, such as Twitter, Foursquare, Flickr, and Box. In June 2012, the service entered the Internet of Things space by integrating with Belkin WeMo devices, allowing Recipes to interact with the physical world. By combining IFTTT with other services such as Yahoo! Pipes, one can build elaborate systems that enable easier consumption of content from a variety of sources.
Platforms.
In addition to its default web-based application, IFTTT released a version of the service for iPhone in July 2013. IFTTT for iPhone adds three exclusive channels: iOS Photos, Reminders and Contacts. An Android version of the app was released on April 24, 2014.
Reception.
IFTTT has been praised by "Forbes", "Time", "Wired", "The New York Times", and "Reader's Digest".

Bensheim-Auerbach station

Bensheim-Auerbach station is a station on the Main-Neckar Railway in the Bensheim district of Auerbach on the Mountain Road in the German state of Hesse. It has a heritage-listed entrance building. The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn (DB) as a category 5 station. Only Regionalbahn services stop at the 3 platform tracks (only tracks 1 and 2 are used regularly).
History.
The station was opened in 1850 along on the Main-Neckar Railway, which was opened in 1846 between Frankfurt and Heidelberg.
The plans for the entrance building were probably drawn up by the Darmstadt court architect Georg Moller. The station is a two-storey building, originally containing railway residential and administrative spaces. It features a gable roof covered with a low pitched roof. Beneath the eaves there are small mezzanine windows. The station has three lines of windows built of yellow sandstone. The southern gable is clad in timber. On the trackside toward the roof there are cast iron columns, which were probably made in 1846. On the southwest side a small signal box house was built in 1920. There is architectural evidence that it was designed by Heinrich Metzendorf.
Infrastructure.
The station is classified as a category 5 station.
In December 2007, DB announced that it intended to sell the station building and shortly later that it had sold it to an investor.
The station is an increasingly important transport hub for the region and it is included in the overall concept for Hessentag 2014, which is being celebrated in Bensheim. There are also proposals to include it on a new line of the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn. Work has therefore been under way since April 2012 to fully rehabilitate it.
Operations.
The trains is served by the RB 60 Regionalbahn (stopping) service on the Heidelberg Hbf–Weinheim (Bergstr)–Bensheim-Auerbach–Bensheim–Darmstadt Hbf–Frankfurt (Main) Hbf route.

United States Invitational Young Physicists Tournament

The United States Invitational Young Physicists Tournament (USIYPT) is an annual physics research and debate tournament for high school students, held the first weekend of February. School-based teams of two to four students investigate several undergraduate-level research problems in preparation for the tournament. The competition itself consists of "physics fights," student-led debates over the quality of each team's solution. Teams are judged on their own solutions to the problems and on their ability to engage in evaluation and discussion of other teams' solutions. The 2014 holder of the USIYPT championship trophy is The Harker School of San Jose, California. The 2015 tournament will be held at Woodberry Forest School in central Virginia.
History.
The United States sent teams to the International Young Physicists' Tournament several times in the 2000s, and achieved a second-place finish in 2005. The nonprofit United States Association for Young Physicists Tournaments was incorporated in 2005, initially for the purpose of supporting and training the US team as well as to spread the pedagogical methodology of preparing and conducting the "physics fight." In 2007, the USAYPT organized their own Young Physicists Tournament, inviting school-based teams from around the world to debate over a slate of four research problems. The one-day event at the North Carolina School of Science and Math (NCSSM) included five teams, all from the United States; Woodberry Forest School won the inaugural championship.
The 2008 tournament, also at NCSSM, included the first "international" team: Brisbane Girls Grammar School. They faced Woodberry Forest School, a boys' boarding school in central Virginia. In the final physics fight, Brisbane's Sarah Thang and Samantha Luck outdueled Woodberry's Chris McLamb and Robert Bauer for the title.
For 2009 and 2010, the event was moved to Woodberry Forest School. Raffles Institution of Singapore beat out an eight-team field for the 2009 title. However, the "snowmaggedon" blizzard of February forced cancellation of the 2010 tournament. Instead, two informal mini-tournaments were held in April, one at Woodberry Forest School, one at the Harker School in California. 
The USIYPT moved to Oak Ridge Associated Universities for 2011 and 2012, and expanded to a two-day, six-round event. Teams and jurors toured Oak Ridge National Laboratory in between sets of physics fights, viewing the High Flux Isotope Reactor and the Spallation Neutron Source. Official sponsorship in 2011 came from the University of Tennessee department of physics, among others. The Harker School won in 2011; Rye Country Day School of New York won in 2012. Oak Ridge High School won the first-ever Clifford Swartz Trophy for top performance in the tournament's poster session. 
The 2014 tournament was held at the Harker School in San Jose, California. The Harker School won the title with playoff victories over Woodberry Forest School and Shenzhen Middle School on the "Magnet Stack" and "Ball Stack" problems. Guilderland High School of New York won the Clifford Swartz Trophy for best poster.
The 2015 tournament will be held at Woodberry Forest School in Virginia on Jan. 30-31.
Teacher education.
Unusual among science competitions, the USIYPT aims to improve physics teaching skills as well as student understanding of the subject. High school teachers are participating members of each school's research team. The sponsoring organization chooses problems for each tournament that are "nontrivial, but not impossible," whose solutions are not necessarily unknown to practicing professional physicists, but are generally new to high school teachers and students. Research is expected to be conducted primarily in each team's school, with direction and assistance from a teacher at that school.

Walking the Halls

Walking the Halls is a 2012 television film directed by Doug Campbell. Originally airing on Lifetime, the film was written by Christine Conradt and Ken Sanders, and features Jamie Luner and Caitlin Thompson.
Plot.
Set in the area of Los Angeles, the film focuses on 18-year-old high school senior student Casey Benson (Caitlin Thompson). When she publicly lashes out at her boyfriend Jeremy (Isiah Adams) for dumping her carelessly in public, she attracts the attention of the school's most popular girls, led by confident and attractive young Amber (Marie Avgeropoulos). Amber and her friends Taylor (Lindsay Taylor) and Kylie (Arden Cho) get her a fake ID, and take her to a nightclub. Little does Casey know that Amber and her friends work as high-profile call girls for the high school's police officer Jack (Matthew Alan). Without informing her that she is supposed to sleep with men in exchange for money, Amber sets Casey up with 28-year-old Max (Jason-Shane Scott). After getting drunk for the first time in her life, Casey spends the night with Max and gets into a fight with her mother Holly (Jamie Luner) after getting home after her curfew, intoxicated. Holly has been in an unhappy marriage with her adulterous husband Christopher (Al Sapienza), who cares little for his family's well-being. Even though her husband does not support her, Holly decides to open her own restaurant with friend Maggie (Darlene Vogel).
The next day, when she receives $600 for having slept with Max, Casey is appalled that she was unknowingly working as a prostitute and immediately turns to Max to confront him with his agreements. Max tries to calm her down, and assures Casey that he is just as interested in her, as she is in him. Later that day, Holly finds out that Christopher has lost all of the family savings on a bad investment, as well as that he is having an affair. She decides to file for divorce and confronts him with the actions, which leads to domestic violence. Holly ends up calling the cops on her own husband, and Christopher is placed under arrest. Casey is shocked by her family situation and blames her mother for not having tried hard enough to make her marriage work. She then reconciles with Amber and heads out to a nightclub to get drunk. There, she is offered $1200 if she sleeps with a wealthy man in his forties. Even though she does not feel attracted to him, she takes Amber up on the deal.
The next day, Holly finds out that Casey has a lot of money, and snoops in her room for clues. When Casey finds out, she decides to move out, and temporarily seeks refuge at Amber's. There, she is convinced to have a threesome with a high roller for $5,000. When they arrive at the high roller's house, he reveals himself to be a very old man. Casey wants to leave, but Amber reminds her of the money and offers her a drug. Casey refuses and complains how ugly and disgusting their client is, her complaints are overheard by the client. After a cocktail, the old man requests both girls to sit next to him on the couch to which they comply awkwardly. He first whispers to Amber to do a sexual act which she reluctantly complies. However, when he requests Casey to do a sexual act, she refuses and runs out of the house. Jack beats her up and forces her back in. Casey is eventually able to flee the scene, but is fired on the spot. She returns to her mother in tears, and admits to having worked as a prostitute. Holly rushes to the school to ask for a transfer, and when she explains the situation, Jack receives notice that his prostitution ring might soon be out on the open. To prevent this from happening, he and Amber (whom he forces to be his accomplice) take the Bensons hostage. Jack forces Christopher to kill his family and then end his own life, but - with Amber's help - Holly and Casey are able to escape, and Holly eventually shoots and kills Jack.
In a voice-over, Casey explains that she finished school and then went to college. Amber left town and was never heard from again. Holly and Christopher made peace with each other, easing their divorce.

Java Pacific Film

Java Pacific Film (alternatively, Java Pasific Film) was a short-lived film production company that helped make significant contributions to Indonesian cinema in the 1930s.
Background.
During 1934 and early 1935, all feature films released in the Dutch East Indies had been directed by The Teng Chun, based on Chinese mythology or martial arts, and targeted at low-class audiences, generally ethnic Chinese. This situation was created by the Great Depression, which had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes, advertisers asking for more money, and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices; this ensured that there was a very low profit margin for local films. During this period cinemas in the country mainly showed Hollywood productions.
History.
Java Pacific Film was founded in 1934 in Bandung, in what was then the Dutch East Indies, by Dutch-Indonesian journalist Albert Balink working with the Wong brothers. Balink, who intended to target high-class audiences, had found financial support for the new company, took control, while the Wongs brought a studio and film equipment to the endeavour. The studio, an old tapioca flour factory, featured simple film editing equipment, several buildings to serve as living quarters for the employees, and a veranda surrounded by trees used for editing. The smokestack had the company's initials, JPF, in large letters. Their first production was a documentary about Mount Merapi, entitled "De Merapi Dreight" ("Mount Merapi Looms"), in 1934.
Dutch filmmaker Mannus Franken was brought to the country in 1934 to help make the movie "Pareh" between 1934 and 1936. Franken had previously had success with documentary filmmaking in the Netherlands. The production cost 75,000 gulden, with its star Rd. Mochtar receiving 250 gulden monthly. A commercial flop which bankrupted the producers and company, "Pareh" is credited with shifting the focus of Indonesian cinema from Chinese productions and subject matter to a more local industry. The film is also praised for its cinematic quality. and its audio.
Successor.
Balink collected funds from numerous sponsors and established the Dutch Indies Film Syndicate (, or ANIF) in late 1936. This government-owned company involved all major figures from JPF. Working mostly on newsreels and documentaries, in 1937 it produced the commercial success "Terang Boelan". In 1938 it released Franken's documentary "Tanah Sabrang" and in 1940 closed.

Francisco Salva Campillo (July 12, 1751 - February 13, 1828) was a Spanish physician, physicist and meteorologist.
Life.
Francisco Salva Campillo was born in Barcelona on July 12, 1751. He was the son of Dr. Jerome Salva Pontich, the doctor of the Barcelona General Hospital. His mother, Eulalia Campillo, came from a wealthy family. He did his primary studies in Barcelona, probably directed by his uncle.
During his adolescence, his extraordinary abilities attracted the attention of the Bishop of Barcelona, Josep Climent, who advised his parents to let him study medicine in Valencia.
He studied at the University of Valencia, where he completed his course in three years instead of the usual four. In 1771, he successfully passed the Bachelor of Medicine exams at the University of Huesca. In the same year, he earned his doctorate in medicine at the University of Toulouse.
At the age of only 22 years, in 1773, he became a member of the Academy of Medical Practice.
Medical career.
He took a special interest in vaccination, particularly against the disease of smallpox.
He received several awards from the Paris Society of Medicine.
He started a medical school in Barcelona in an effort to train more doctors.
Telegraphy.
In 1795, Dr. Salva presented at the Academy of Natural Sciences and Arts of Barcelona his first report devoted to "The Electricity applied to telegraphy." Salva demonstrated the basis of electric telegraphy, anticipating the wireless telegraph and undersea cables.
The presentation of Salva attracted the attention of government.
He received a formal invitation to demonstrate his telegraphic skills before the Royal Family in Aranjuez.
Legacy.
He left behind a massive library composed of more than five hundred thousand volumes on medical topics. Along with these works, he bequeathed to the Royal Academy of Medicine of Barcelona a sum of four thousand pounds.
In accordance with his will, his heart is preserved in an urn, with his books, at the Royal Academy of Medicine of Barcelona.

WildFly

WildFly, formerly known as JBoss AS, or simply JBoss, is an application server authored by JBoss, now developed by Red Hat. WildFly is written in Java, and implements the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) specification. It runs on multiple platforms.
WildFly is free and open-source software, subject to the requirements of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), version 2.1.
The renaming to WildFly was done to reduce confusion. The renaming only affects the JBoss Application Server project. The JBoss Community or the Red Hat JBoss product line (with JBoss Enterprise Application Platform) all retain their names.
Origin.
In 1999, Marc Fleury started a free software project named "EJB-OSS" (stands for "Enterprise Java Bean Open Source Software") implementing the EJB API from J2EE (Java 2 Enterprise Edition). Sun Microsystems asked the project to stop using the "EJB" trademark within its name. "EJB-OSS" was then renamed to "JBOSS", then "JBoss" later.
Versions.
JBoss AS 4.0, a Java EE 1.4 application server, features an embedded Apache Tomcat 5.5 servlet container. It supports any Java Virtual Machine (JVM) between versions 1.4 and 1.6. JBoss can run on numerous operating systems including many POSIX platforms (like GNU/Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X), Microsoft Windows and others, as long as a suitable JVM is present.
JBoss AS 4.2 also functions as a Java EE 1.4 application server, but deploys Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0 by default. It requires the Java Development Kit version 5, and includes Tomcat 5.5.
JBoss AS 5.1, released in 2009, operates as a Java EE 5 application server. It is a minor update of the major release JBoss AS 5.0, which was in development for at least three years and was built on top of a new JBoss microcontainer. JBoss AS 5.1 contains a preview of some elements from the Java EE 6 specification.
JBoss AS 6.0, an unofficial implementation of Java EE 6, was released on December 28, 2010. Although JBoss AS 6 does not support the full Java EE 6 stack, it chose not to support this officially by obtaining an official certification from Oracle. It does, however, officially support the Java EE 6 Web Profile.
JBoss AS 7, was released on July 12, 2011, only six months after the last major release, JBoss AS 6. Unlike previous increments of the major versioning number, JBoss AS 7 supports the same Java EE specification as the last major release, namely Java EE 6. The Java EE profile is only partially implemented in JBoss AS 7, e.g. it includes MDBs, but listening to JMS destinations (which is mandated by the full spec) is not supported. It is, however, certified for the Web Profile. The software code has been completely rewritten for JBoss AS 7. Major changes visible to the user are the inability to define resources like JMS destinations and datasources inside archives (war/ear), the way datasources are defined, a much smaller size (less than half of JBoss AS 6) and a 10-fold reduction in startup time.
JBoss AS 7.1, was released in February 2012. The remaining parts of the EE spec were implemented, and this version was certified for the EE full profile.
WildFly 8 is the direct continuation to the JBoss AS project. WildFly 8.0.0 Final stable release was officially released February 11, 2014.
Licensing and pricing.
JBoss itself is open source, but Red Hat charges to provide a support subscription for JBoss Enterprise Middleware. Before November 2010 JBoss was licensed as annual subscription in bundles of 4 and 32 CPU sockets. As of November 2010 the licensing changed and all cores on the system are now counted. The core bundles licensing is available for 16 and 64 cores.

<doc id="36533387" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36533387" title="Roman army mutiny in 342 BC">
Roman army mutiny in 342 BC

Several ancient authors have written descriptions of a Roman army mutiny in 342 BC. According to the most well-known version, the mutiny originated in a group of Roman garrison soldiers wintering in Campania to protect the cities there against the Samnites. Subverted by the luxurious living of the Campanians, these soldiers conspired to take over their host cities. When the conspiracy was discovered, the conspirators formed a rebel army and marched against Rome. They were met by an army commanded by Marcus Valerius Corvus who had been nominated dictator to solve the crisis. Rather than do battle, Corvus managed to end the mutiny by peaceful means. All the mutineers received amnesty for their part in the rebellion and a series of laws were passed to address their political grievances.
All preserved accounts of the mutiny were however written several hundred years after the events they describe. Modern historians have found many elements in the classical accounts resembling the civil strife of the Late Republic which they consider anachronistic to the Roman Republic of the late 4th century BC. Some even believe the mutiny to be entirely invented by writers wishing to provide a context for the important political reforms they knew had been legislated in 342 BC.
Classical accounts.
The most the extensive description of the mutiny, that has been preserved, is provided by Livy (59 BC - 17 AD), who makes it the closing episode of the Seventh Book of his history of Rome, "Ab Urbe Condita". Livy knew of two conflicting accounts of the mutiny, descriptions of the first has been preserved in fragments of two other authors. A fragment of Dionysius of Halicarnassus's (c. 60 BC – after 7 BC) "Roman Antiquities" provides an elaborate description of the first half of the mutiny, but then breaks off. Another complete, but more summarily, account is preserved in a fragment from Appian's (c. 95 AD – c. 165 AD)"Roman History". Similarities in wording makes it probable that Appian used Dionysius as his source.
First version, conspiracy at Capua.
The backdrop of the first version is the First Samnite War which had broken out in 343 when Rome came to the aid of Capua and the Campanians against the Samnites. According to the ancient writers the Roman consul Marcus Valerius Corvus during that year campaigned in Campania and won two battles against the Samnites, at the Battle of Mount Gaurus and the Battle of Suessula. At the end of the campaign season the people of Suessula and Capua requested garrisons from Rome to defend them against the Samnites during the winter. According to Dionysius, the Roman senate authorized Marcus Valerius to organize the garrisons, as large as the host cities wished to support. Valerius filled the garrisons with men who wished to stay and receive army rations and pay, mostly these were poor and homeless debt-ridden men. However the opulent decadence of Capua soon started to undermine the morale and patriotism of the Roman troops sent there and they started planning how to make themselves masters of Capua
The Romans elected Gaius Marcius Rutilus and Quintus Servilius Ahala as their consuls for 342. Campania was alloted Marcius, an experienced general and statesman who was now consul for the fourth time, and he discovered the conspiracy. Marcius caused a rumour to be spread that the troops would have the same winter quarters next year as well. Deprived of any sense of urgency the agitation died down. With the army settled into summer quarters, Marcius begun quietly to cleanse the army for mutinous elements. Some were discharged from service for having served their time or for disabilities, others were sent on furlough or transferred to serve elsewhere, all these were detained in Rome by the other consul and the praetor on various pretexts. At first glad to visit their homes, those sent away grew suspicious when they realized they were not to rejoin the army and that the leading agitators appeared to have been singled out. Concluding that their conspiracy had been discovered, they started to fear they would soon suffer court martial and secret execution. A cohort stationed at Anxur took up position at Lautulae where to intercept those men the consul was sending home. According to Dionysius and Appian the mutineers also recruited prisoners to their cause. At this point the fragment of Dionysius breaks off. 
The army of the mutineers soon grew considerably in size, to about 20 000 men according to Appian. Acoording to Livy they shifted their camp to below the hill of Alba Longa where they debated who to offer leadership of their army. They decided upon Titus Quinctius who they learned was living in a villa nearby. This man came from a prominent patrician family, the Quinctia, and had had a distinguished military career, but a wound had made him lame in one foot and he had taken up a rural life far from Rome. Not expecting that he would accept leadership over them voluntarily, a party of the mutineers broke into Quinctius' house at night and carried him away to their camp where he was saluted as commander. On their own initiative the mutineers then broke camp and marched against Rome, only halting eight miles from the city when they learned that an army was marching against them, commanded by Marcus Valerius Corvus, who had been appointed Dictator with Lucius Aemilius Mamercus as Master of the Horse 
Livy writes that as soon as the enemy army came into view, the mutineers, who had never experienced civil war, started having second thoughts and negotiations were started. In a speech to the mutineers Marcus Valerius recalled their past services together while Titus Quinctius urged them to entrust themselves to Valerius and his reputation for integrity and sympathy for the common soldiers. The mutineers gave a shout of approval, whereupon Titus Quinctius urged Marcus Valerius to intervene on behalf of the mutineers and secure them from punishment.
Appian never mentions Titus Quinctius, possibly due to the briefness of his account. According to him, the mutineers were met at the Alban mount about one day's march from Rome by the army of the Dictator, Marcus Valerius Corvus. Corvus was reluctant to engage the mutineers in battle and instead set up camp while he investigated the matter further. The men of the two armies started to mingle, the mutineers complaining that their rebellion had been caused by the heavy debts they were suffering under at Rome. Unwilling to start a civil war, Corvus convinced the Senate to decree a cancellation of debts to all Romans, and immunity to the rebels. The mutineers then laid down their arms and returned to Rome.
Second version, mutiny in Rome.
Livy also summarizes a second version found in some annalists he had consulted. According to these there was no dictator, the affair was entirely handled by the consuls and the mutiny broke out in Rome itself. At night the conspirators seized one Gaius Manlius from his bed to be their leader and marched out to establish a fortified position four miles from the city. The consuls moved against them with another army, but when the battle lines drew close, rather than fight, the soldiers of both sides exchanged greetings, clasped hands and embraced each other. Seeing that the soldiers were not interested in fighting, the consuls put proposals of reconciliation to the senate.
Historicity of the mutiny.
Much of the detail provided in the first version is of questionable historical accuracy. The first version with its focus on Campania is follows smoothly from preceding events in the Samnite War, but it was not beyond ancient writers to invent such connections. Moral corruption from luxurious living in Campania is a common theme in Roman historical writing. The plot to seize Capua is similar to the actions of the Mamertines at Messina. The abduction of Titus Quinctius from his villa resembles the famous legend of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus being summoned from the plough to command Rome's army. It is more likely that some authors, perhaps Valerius Antias, have invented a dictatorship for Valerius Corvus than that others have chosen to omit it.
The second version also has several problems. It was recorded in fewer sources and shares similarities with the sedition of Marcus Manlius Capitolinus. There are other possible parallels as well. The centurion sent by Catiline to organize his conspiracy in Etruria in 63 BC was named Gaius Manlius. The story of how the consuls' and the mutineers' armies spontaneously made peace could be based on events in 83 BC when the army of consul Lucius Cornelius Scipio went over to Lucius Cornelius Sulla. If these two are true parallels, the second version of the mutiny must be a very late invention. It is possible then that both surviving versions of the mutiny have been invented by later annalists.
While most of the surviving narratives of the mutiny must probably be discarded as fiction, Oakley(1998) believes some kind of sedition actually took place in 342 which has later been embellished. All of Livy's sources recorded that a revolt took place, moreover some of the measures which according to Livy were passed in aftermath of the mutiny seems too obscure to have been invented out of nothing. Forsythe(2005) considers the mutiny a fiction invented by later Roman writers to provide context for the important laws that were passed this year.
Political aftermath, the Leges Genuciae.
Livy's account.
According to Livy, Valerius brought forward a proposal granting immunity to all who had taken part in the secession during an assembly of the people at the Peteline Grove. A "Lex Sacrata" ("sacred law") that no one should be struck from the military list against his will was also passed, and furthermore a law that no one who had been military tribune could afterwards be centurion, this law was made due to one Publius Salonius, who had every year been either military tribune or first centurion, and that the cavalry should have their pay reduced for having acted against the mutineers. Some of Livy's sources also stated that a tribune of the plebs, Lucius Genucius, secured the passage of laws declaring usury illegal, that no one could be reelected to the same office within less than ten years or hold more than one office at the same time, and that both consuls could be elected from the plebs. In Livy's opinion, the mutiny must have been of considerable strength if they managed to extract all these concessions.
Modern views.
The Peteline Grove was also the location where Marcus Manlius was condemned, and is likely a fictional addition. It is unclear why the Romans needed a law protecting soldiers from involuntary delistment. Possibly the law was intended as a restriction on consular powers, especially if the consuls had used their powers arbitrarily to quell the mutiny. it is unlikely that purpose of the law barring military tribunes from becoming centurions were intended to protect military tribunes from demotion since the military tribunate had been made elective in 362. A possibility is that this law clearly defined the military tribune as outranking the centurion and ensured these two offices were held in ascending order. Another possibility is to accept the story of Publius Salonius as genuine. Perhaps already existing regulations had banned individuals from being military tribunes in consecutive years, but Salonius had broken these in spirit by repeated switches between first centurion and military tribune. In later years military tribunes were usually young men of prominent families while centurion was the highest rank a commoner could aspire to after years of military service. This important social distinction might have been caused either accidentally or deliberately by this law.

Casualties of the Syrian Civil War

Estimates of deaths in the Syrian War, per opposition activist groups, vary between 114,835 and 162,400. On 24 July 2013, the United Nations put out an estimate of over 100,000 that had died in the war.
UNICEF reported that over 500 children had been killed by early February 2012. Another 400 children have been reportedly arrested and tortured in Syrian prisons. Both claims have been contested by the Syrian government. Additionally, over 600 detainees and political prisoners have died under torture. By mid-May 2014, the opposition activist group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported the number of children killed in the conflict had risen to 8,607, while at the same time 5,586 women were also killed. According to the UN, 6,561 children were killed by mid-June 2013. The Oxford Research Group said that a total of 11,420 children had been killed in the conflict by late November 2013.
Overall deaths.
The number of fatalities in the conflict, according to the Syrian opposition website "Syrian Martyrs", is 110,239, updated to 30 June 2014. The number includes 21,162 rebels, including 326 foreign fighters, but does not include members of the government security forces or pro-government foreign combatants who have died. 856 foreign civilians who have died in the conflict are also included in the toll, most of them, 684, being Palestinians. The "Syrian Martyrs" number is significantly higher than the ones presented by other organisations, including the UN, one reason being they record deaths even when no name is given for the reportedly killed individual.
Other estimates range from 114,835 to 162,400. Except for the SNHR figure, which excludes pro-government and ISIS fighters, all of the following totals include civilians, rebels and security forces:
Al Jazeera journalist Nir Rosen reported that many of the deaths reported daily by activists are in fact armed insurgents falsely presented as civilian deaths, but confirmed that real civilian deaths do occur on a regular basis. A number of Middle East political analysts, including those from the Lebanese Al Akhbar newspaper, have also urged caution.
This was later confirmed when in late May 2012, Rami Abdulrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which is one of the opposition-affiliated groups counting the number of those killed in the uprising, stated that civilians who had taken up arms during the conflict were being counted under the category of "civilians".
In May 2013, SOHR stated that at least 41,000 of those killed during the conflict were Alawites.
The Next Century Foundation offer an alternative analysis of casualty figures. Their calculations are made by using figures from the Center for Documentation of Violations in Syria (VDC), Syrian Shuhada (Syrian Martyrs), Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Local Coordination Committees of Syria (LCC) and Damascus Centre for Human Rights from June 2012 to the present. Figures for civilian, rebel and government casualties are calculated separately and added together for an overall total.
Combatant deaths.
Government forces.
The Syrian Army fatalities figure also includes at least 37 members of the Palestinian PLA.
The non-Syrian Shiite militiamen fatalities figure includes: 770+ Iraqi Shia militiamen, 67 Iranian IRGC soldiers, at least 24 Afghans and one member of the Lebanese Amal Movement.
Of the Palestinian militia deaths, at least 20 were PFLP–GC members.
Except one death (August 2011), all of the Hezbollah fatalities have occurred since September 2012.
In early December 2013, rebels claimed that a pro-government Russian fighter was killed in fighting in Aleppo.
In addition, 1,000 civilian government officials have also been killed.
Opposition forces.
Due to the opposition's policy of counting rebel fighters that were not defectors as civilians a comprehensive number of rebels killed in the conflict, thus far, has not been ascertained. In late November 2012, the opposition activist group SOHR estimated that at least 10,000 rebels had been killed, but noted the possibility of the figure being higher because the rebels, like the government, were lying about how many of their forces had died to make it look like they were winning. In March 2013, SOHR stated that the actual number of killed rebels and government forces could be double the number they were already able to document.
The following tables provide examples of news reports which identify rebel casualties. The first table shows reports of rebel deaths for the period up to 17 May 2014, and those not included in SOHR's daily death tolls before and after 17 May 2014. The second table shows day-by-day reports of rebel deaths by SOHR after 17 May 2014.
It should be noted that at least 104 rebel suicide bombers and 86 rebel child soldiers have been killed in the conflict.
Foreigners killed.
Foreign civilians killed.
"Note: The Palestinian figure includes several dozens of Palestinian combatants from both sides and not just civilians. 840 of the killed Palestinians were residents of the Yarmouk Camp."
Foreign opposition fighters killed.
13,529 foreign opposition fighters have been killed by mid-May 2014, according to the SOHR.
9,936 foreign opposition fighters were killed by late December 2013, according to the "Jihadist Salafist Movement in Jordan", with the nationalities being as follows: 1,902 Tunisians, 1,807 Libyans, 1,432 Iraqis, 828 Lebanese, 821 Egyptians, 800 Palestinians, 714 Saudis, 571 Yemenis, 412 Moroccans, 274 Algerians, 202 Jordanians, 91 Omanis, 71 Kuwaitis, 42 Somalis, 30 Albanians and Caucasians, 21 Bahrainis, 9 Emiratis, 8 Qataris, 3 Sudanese and 1 Mauritanian. The London-based "European Centre for Syria Research" put the number of Saudis killed even higher at 729 a month earlier in November 2013. The jihadist movement updated the number of Jordanians killed by mid-June 2014 to 342.
According to Abu Omar al-Shishani, the Chechen ISIS commander, 500 militants from the Caucasus had been killed by mid-January 2014 since the start of the war.
The nationalities of some others are as follows: 90 Turks, 51 Albanians, 43 Chechens, 28-112 Azerbaijanis, 28 Britons, 30 Frenchmen, 21 Belgians, 21 Germans, 18 Bosniaks, 16 Dagestanis, 13 Afghans, 12 Swedes, 10-17 Australians, 10 Danes, 10 Dutch, 8-11 Norwegian, 8 Russians, 6 Canadians, 3 Americans, 3 Irishmen, 3 Pakistanis, 3 Tajiks, 2 Chinese, 2 Italians, 2 Eritreans, 2 Kyrgyz, 2 Finns, 2 Mauritanians, 2 Uzbeks, 1 Armenian, 1 Bulgarian, 1 Chadian, 1 Indonesian, 1 Iranian, 1 Israeli-Arab, 1 Maldivian, 1 Romanian and 1 Spaniard.
Foreign soldiers killed.
28 foreign soldiers have been killed during the conflict.

Grenada College

Grenada College was a college for women, founded by Baptists, in Grenada, Mississippi in 1851.
The college was founded in 1851 as the Yalobusha Female Institute. Its first president was Dr. W. S. Webb, who served until 1857. At first classes were held in the Union Hotel in Grenada, and also in the College Inn at 123 S. College Street. The college subsequently raised enough money for a building, which was completed by 1858.
The college closed during the American Civil War and its buildings were used for hospitals.
When it reopened, the college was known as the Emma Mercer Institute, and then Grenada Female College. Control of the college passed to the Methodist church in 1882, which renamed it Grenada College in 1884.
As of 1915, the college granted both Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Letters degrees, and had 13 faculty members.
In 1936, financial troubles led the church to close the school and transfer its assets to Millsaps College. The buildings were finally destroyed in the 1980s.

Bréhon Tower

In 1914 the War Office transferred ownership of Bréhon Tower to the States of Guernsey. During the German Occupation of the Channel Islands, the German military placed an anti-aircraft gun on the tower.
Today, although the site is open to visitors, the tower is closed. The tower holds a light operated by the Guernsey Harbour Authority. The island is home to a breeding colony of Common Terns.
History.
An obelisk was erected on Bréhon in 1744 to serve as a sea mark. However the lack of visibility of the obelisk led to its replacement in 1824 by a tower 40 ft high and 34 ft in circumference, topped by a globe. 
During the tenure (1803-1813) of Lieutenant Governor General Sir John Doyle, there were plans to erect a guardhouse on Bréhon, but nothing came of these. Doyle was responsible, however, for substantial fortification efforts elsewhere in Guernsey, including the construction of the Martello towers of Fort Grey, Fort Saumarez, and Fort Hommet.
Then in the 1840s there was a renewed concern about British relations with France, with particular concern for the protection of Alderney and the other Channel Islands because of their strategic importance in the Channel. Lieutenant Governor Major-General Sir William Francis Patrick Napier proposed a number of works, including the establishment of a fort on Bréhon.
In 1850 the British became concerned that the French had created fortifications at Cherbourg. This led to the construction of several towers and forts in the Channel area.
The Alderney cutter "Experiment" was wrecked off Bréhon in March 1850. 
A review of Guerney's defences in 1852 recommended the construction of three artillery barracks, Fort Richmond, Fort Hommet, and Fort Le Marchant, the upgrading of Fort Doyle, and the construction of Bréhon Tower. Work on Bréhon Tower commenced in 1854 and was completed in 1856. The total cost was £8,098 18s 10d.
Bréhon Tower's role was to guard the shipping channel between Guernsey and Herm, and help protect the harbour of St Peter Port. The fort's footprint measures 65 feet by 85 feet (at the widest point), and the tower stands 34 feet high. The tower has three levels. The magazine, shell room, shifting room, stores, and fresh-water cistern were all on the ground floor. It also had latrines on the same floor, a Victorian innovation. The first floor contained the garrison's living quarters. The original plan was to put three heavy guns on the gun platform at the top, with five guns on the (second) floor below, sharing the 14 cannon ports. However, during construction the armament was cut back to three 68-pounder and two 10-inch shell guns, all on the gun platform. By World War I the tower was obsolete and the War Office turned it over to the States of Guernsey. The garrison was originally to have consisted of two officers and 60 NCOs and other ranks, but with the reduction in armament, two officers and 30 men was deemed sufficient.
During World War II, the Germans placed an anti-aircraft gun on the tower. This is credited with shooting down several allied planes, and one German plane, which crashed on Crevichon.

INPP4B

Inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase, type II, 105kDa is a protein that in humans is encoded by the INPP4B gene.
INPP4B encodes the inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II, one of the enzymes involved in phosphatidylinositol signaling pathways. This enzyme removes the phosphate group at position 4 of the inositol ring from inositol 3,4-bisphosphate. There is limited data to suggest that the human type II enzyme is subject to alternative splicing, as has been established for the type I enzyme.

<doc id="36533671" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36533671" title="Scorporo">
Scorporo

Scorporo is a mixed member electoral system (sometimes referred to as an additional member system) whereby a portion of members are elected in single member districts (SMDs) and a portion are elected from a list. It may be fully defined as a parallel voting system, but which excludes a portion (up to 100%) of the SMD winners' votes in electing the proportional tier to result in a more proportional outcome. The exclusion of a portion of the SMD winners' votes is what makes scorporo fundamentally different from parallel voting and somewhat closer to mixed member proportional representation, and thereby between the two in terms of proportionality. The system is only known to have been used in Italy and for a portion of the compensatory tier of the National Assembly of Hungary.
Use in Italy.
Scorporo was in force for elections to the bicameral Parliament of Italy based on Law 277/1993 from 1993 to 2005. Under this system, members could be elected in two ways:
The system was subject to the following specific rules for each chamber:
Abuse in the 2001 Italian Chamber of Deputies election.
In the Italian general election, 2001, one of the two main coalitions (the House of Freedoms, which opposed the system), linked many of their constituency candidates to a decoy list ("liste civetta") in the proportional parts, under the name "Abolizione Scorporo". As a defensive move, the other coalition, Olive Tree, felt obliged to do the same, under the name "Paese Nuovo". This successfully circumvented the compensatory element of proportional lists.
The voters in the constituency seats won by each coalition were still effectively counted in the number of proportional seats they received. Between them, the two decoy lists won 360 of the 475 constituency seats, more than half of the total of 630 seats available, despite winning a combined total of less than 0.2% of the national proportional part of the vote. In the case of Forza Italia (part of the House of Freedoms), the tactic was so successful that it did not have enough candidates in the proportional tier to receive as many seats as it in fact won, missing out on 12 seats.
This was facilitated by the fact that this particular scorporo system allowed the SMD vote and the list voted not to be linked. Decoy lists are a common issue in all compensatory and pseudo-compensatory systems and was not a unique problem for scorporo.
Abolition.
Due to Silvio Berlusconi's opposition to the system, Italy reverted to list semi-proportional representation in 2005.
Use in Hungary.
The compensatory tier of the National Assembly of Hungary (which follows a type of parallel voting with an additional compensatory systems) is allocated to parties crossing a national 5% threshold based on losing candidates' votes in the first round of single district voting. However, each party's totals are further augmented by "any wasted" votes from the regional list-tier elections (see below).
Proportional systems.
Several systems using regional list proportional representation contain a compensatory element similar to scorporo for wasted votes at the district or regional level. Because list PR systems may have more than one candidate elected in a district, typically these systems use "wasted votes" rather than the votes of losing candidates.
Countries that make use of such tiers are:

Sean Furey

Sean Furey (born August 31, 1982) is an American javelin thrower. He has placed in the top three at the U.S. National Championships three times, winning the javelin event in 2010. In 2009, he represented the United States at the World Championships, finishing 12th. In 2012, Furey placed fourth at the Olympic Trials. Since the first and second placers had not met the Olympic "A" Standard and Furey had, he qualified to represent the United States at the 2012 Summer Olympics.
Early life.
Sean Furey was born August 31, 1982 to Kathy Furey (who later became Kathy Stupak by marriage). He grew up in Methuen, Massachusetts with his younger brother Ryan and began throwing the javelin while at Methuen High School. He won two state javelin championships and in 2000, won the National Scholastic Championship. During his senior season, Furey led his school to the Merrimack Valley Conference title and was named to the All-Scholastic team by the "Boston Herald". He graduated from Methuen in 2000. Furey also played on the school's football team.
After high school, Furey attended Dartmouth. He graduated in 2005 with a 3.80 GPA and an engineering degree.
Athletic career.
At Dartmouth, Furey set the school record in javelin, with a distance of . In 2005, he won the Ivy League championship and was named the "Scholar Athlete of the Year" by the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association. At the 2005 NCAA Outdoor Championships, he placed third with a throw of .
After college, Furey moved to San Diego to train. At the 2008 Olympic Trials, he placed seventh. In 2009, he placed third in the National Championships and qualified for Worlds with a throw of . At the World Championships, he was in fifth place among the "B" group after the qualification round of the javelin throw. However, he did not match that success in the final and finished in 12th place out of 12 competitors that made the final.
Furey won the 2010 National Championships with a throw of . In 2011, he finished in second place, recording a distance of . At the 2011 Pan American Games, Furey placed fourth.
At the 2012 Olympic Trials, Furey was battling a back injury.
He placed fourth, throwing the javelin . Two weeks prior to the Trials, he had met the Olympic "A" Standard of by throwing a new personal best in Lisle, Illinois. First and second place did not make the make standard, allowing Furey and fifth place finisher Cyrus Hostetler to make the Olympic team. After the meet, he remarked "It's mixed emotions, fourth place vs. the Olympic team ... It's bittersweet. I just didn't execute like I needed."
Furey entered the 2012 Olympics with the longest throw by an American in 2012, and was ranked number 16 in the world. He competed in the "B" group preliminary round of the javelin throw on August 8. He placed 18th in his group and 37th overall and did not advance to the finals.
Furey is coached by former Olympian Todd Reich and sponsored by Mizuno. "Todd is a talented guy," says Furey. "He knows what the elite javelin throwers are doing." Furey says he has no plans to retire anytime soon. "I won't quit until my arm falls off," he said.
Personal life.
Furey currently lives in San Diego, California with his wife Matthan "Mattie" Chatterton-Richmond. He works part-time at Raytheon as a mechanical engineer doing what he describes as "bomb-proofing electronics" for the United States Navy. When asked why he chose to continue pursuing the javelin, instead of concentrating on his higher paying engineering career, Furey remarked "Missing out on money, I don't care. We have everything we need and more. Making money won't make me happier. Being on the Olympic team will make me happier."

Stop That Train (The Spanishtonians song)

"Stop That Train" is a 1965 ska song by Jamaican band The Spanishtonians (also known as the Spanish Town Skabeats), that has been covered and sampled by numerous artists. Its most famous cover was its first, a 1967 cover by Keith & Tex. That rendition was in turn sampled by various artists, including Scotty, the Beastie Boys and Vanilla Ice. The song has also been covered by Clint Eastwood & General Saint and Don Campbell.
Lyrics.
The original version of "Stop That Train" is sung from the point of view of a woman whose boyfriend is leaving by train for a long absence. She yells at the conductor, apparently in vain, to "stop that train", because she wants to join him on board.
Keith & Tex version.
Jamaican duo Keith & Tex covered the song in 1967, in their signature rocksteady style. Their version flipped the song's genders, changing the lyrics from "my baby he is leaving" to "my baby she is leaving". The song became Keith & Tex's biggest hit.
Samples.
Several dub versions of the song were recorded, which sampled the Keith & Tex version. The most notable was "Draw Your Brakes" by Scotty, which appeared on the classic soundtrack album to the 1972 film "The Harder They Come". Another dub version was the 1972 "Cool Breeze" by Big Youth.
The Keith & Tex version was also sampled by the Beastie Boys, on the section called "Stop That Train" from their 1989 song B-Boy Bouillabaisse.
It was also sampled by rapper Vanilla Ice, in a 1991 single also entitled "Stop That Train".
Other covers.
The Jamaican reggae duo Clint Eastwood & General Saint recorded a cover version of "Stop That Train", which was released as a single in 1983, and was the title track of their 1983 album "Stop That Train". Their version replaced the original song's verses with an interpolation of the folk song 500 Miles, as well as the lyrics "Hey mister postman, bring back my woman".
British reggae singer Don Campbell, along with General Saint, recorded a cover version of Stop That Train in 1994, as "Saint & Campbell". Their version had a house music influence, and replaced the original song's verses with new lyrics sung in a toasting style.

Saint Vincent Grammar School

Saint Vincent Grammar School (abbreviated S.V.G.S) is a secondary school located in Richmond Hill, Kingstown, on the island of Saint Vincent in the Caribbean. Established in 1908, it is the oldest institution offering secondary level education in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and is a single-sex school. Entrance to the school is by an academic selection test called the Common Entrance Examination, acceptance granted traditionally to those male students who rank in the top 150 places of his gender in the examination.
The Saint Vincent Grammar School is one of the most academically successful and consistently high achieving secondary schools in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, consistently ranking among the top three schools based on Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC) examinations results. In the past five years, the school has recorded pass rates of upwards of 85%.
There are approximately 750 pupils on the school roll.
History.
An attempt to have an institution for secondary education was made when the Saint Vincent Grammar School was founded by an Ordinance in 1878. Conditions, however, were not satisfactory at the school and in 1885 moves were afoot to abolish it. The inhabitants on the island-here the influential minority-refused to support these moves and stated that they "would be just as clamorous for the restoration of such an institution as the people of Grenada now are for the establishment of one."
In 1887 another attempt at establishing another school was made when The Inspector of Schools, Mr F.H. Hawkins started the Kingstown Grammar School but the effort died when he was transferred a few years later to the Leeward Islands. A fourth Grammar School, a co-educational one, was started by Mr. Miles Phillips in 1896 and by 1899 had 42 pupils on its roll. As the thrust for more knowledge to promote the best interests of the emerging agro-based economy on the island of Saint Vincent, a new Agricultural School was established in 1900. Later that school would be further developed to become the Saint Vincent Grammar School. 
The Saint Vincent Grammar School opened its doors in September 1908 with a student body of 13 and under and under a Resident Master Mr F.W Reeves who also held the portfolio of Inspector of Schools. Students entered the establishment at 8 years of age until the establishment of the Kingstown Preparatory School that catered to students from ages 5 to 11. In 1914, with the closure of the Saint Vincent Agricultural School, the Grammar School took over its quarters. The present school still stands on the same premises though in a new building that was opened in 1965. The original building was still used on occasions for particular functions until its destruction by fire in 1999.
The original building was enlarged in 1932 to accommodate additional classrooms and, in 1940, the Headmaster's quarters we converted into the Headmaster's Office, Masters' Common Room and two classrooms. With the growth of enrollment, there was need for additional space which engaged the attention of the authorities in the early 1940s. By 1947, enrolment had grown to 203 and the additional space came in 949 when as quoted in the School Magazine of that year, ""There is now an imposing entrance with a grand flight of steps leading to a small porch flanked by two patches of grass and beds of yellow flowers forming the letters "G"-"S". On each side of this entrance extend forty five feet of white architecture, housing two new classrooms, an assembly hall and a small room used for storing books.""
Provision was also made for the Headmaster's Office, Teachers' Common Room and lavatories. The school later boasted of hosting its first end-of-term dance in the new hall with its fluorescent lighting and with the school band.
Although for most of its existence the school was a boys' school, in 1948 for 'greater economy and efficiency', combined classes were held with its neighbouring school, the Saint Vincent Girls' High School. In 1969, the sixth form as the Girls' High School was closed, and from 1969 to 1995, girls wanting to pursue advanced level studies were formally admitted as students to the Grammar School. This was mainly at the sixth form level but also involved at times the fourth and fifth forms of both schools. With its greater emphasis on the sciences, students from the Girls' High School were accommodated in the Grammar School's laboratory. This went on until there was a combined sixth form housed at the Grammar School and later an independent Sixth Form College.
The Grammar School was a fee paying institution that in the context of the times would have catered to students from 'better off' families. In 1911, however, the first scholarships were offered from primary schools. An annual exhibition paying tuition and providing a grant toward the cost of board and lodging for the recipient for four years was instituted in 1917. Students who became beneficiaries had to be residing not less than one mile beyond the boundary of Kingstown. By 1935, 17 boys were receiving free education through scholarships from Government, The Kingstown Board, the Anglican and Methodist Churches and the Reeves Memorial Scholarship. The George McIntosh-led Saint Vincent Working Men's Association from the beginning of its existence in 1937 offered three scholarships.
A 1921 Island Scholarship Ordinance catered for a scholarship biennially to an approved university. It was awarded to the best performer in the Cambridge Senior Examination and was tenable for five years. In 1995 the last four students were awarded with island scholarships and the system was replaced with the National Scholarship and Exhibition Scholarships.
The Saint Vincent Grammar School served the public and teaching service. In 1914 pupil teachers who demonstrated promise were selected for the two year course at the School before beginning their teaching career. By 1936 with the hope of increasing the number of recruits from the secondary schools, the Cambridge Local Examinations replace the College of Perceptors as an entrance to the teaching service. In the 1950s teachers of Secondary Schools provided lectures in academic subjects in a course specially organised by the education department for persons who were entering the primary school teaching service.
Motto.
Per Aspera ad Astra is the motto of the Saint Vincent Grammar School and it is a Latin phrase which means any of the following: "Through rough ways to the stars", "A rough road leads to the stars" or "To the stars through difficulties". The phrase is one of many Latin sayings which use the expression "Ad astra".
The School's Motto appears on the School Crest.
Curriculum.
Saint Vincent Grammar School teaches a wide range of subjects and disciplines. Its curriculum is structured around CXC CSEC syllabuses and teaching based on these syllabuses usually begins at the Third Form (Year 9) level for some subjects. Like most other secondary schools in the Caribbean, Mathematics, English Language and one Foreign Language are compulsory at all levels. 
A total of 13 subjects are offered in the first, second and third forms. Biology, chemistry, physics and principles of business are included at third form as the students prepare for the subsequent 'CXC Years' (Years 10 and 11). In these two final years, students are sorted into 6 different classes, based on their choice and/ or performance in third form. These classes, unlike in the previous forms, are specialised for certain subjects, meaning that each class offer subjects based on their type. For example, Forms 4 and 5 Technical are specialised for 'Technical' subjects such as Building Technology, while Forms 4 and 5 Science are specialised for 'Science' subjects such as Chemistry. 
Each 'CXC' class offers 9 subjects but the student may do more but no less than 6. The CXC CSEC examinations are offered from April(or May) to June and students can write some these examinations while in the fourth form but most require at least two or three years exposure to the subject.
House System.
There are four houses into which students are placed upon entry to the Saint Vincent Grammar School. Each house has a House Master/Mistress, a House Captain and Vice Captain. Inter-House Competitions are held in all sports offered at the school. The sports that are currently being offered are:
Annually, each house participates in an Inter-House Athletic Championship in which track and field events are contested.
There are also inter-house competitions in Public Speaking and Debating.
Listed below are the houses of the Saint Vincent Grammar School
School Song.
The school song of the Saint Vincent Grammar School was written and composed by Mr. Patrick Prescod in 1966. 
1 We hail our Alma Mater
The Guardian of our youth
The Moulder of our character
Guide in our search for truth
A healthy mind and body
She helps us to attain
Per Aspera ad Astra
Our Motto and our Aim
Per Aspera ad Astra
Our Motto and our Aim
2 We sing of heights achieved
At study and at play
Of diligence maintained
Though rough or smooth the way
With those who come before us
And those who follow on
We join in one great chorus
To sing this glorius song
Per Aspera ad Astra
Let strains ring loud and long.

In the Spring of 2007, the group offered its first self-presented performance. In the Fall of that same year, the group was renamed the Oakville Chamber Ensemble and began to offer a full series of 5 concerts per season. A few seasons later, to avoid confusion with other local groups similarly named, the Oakville Chamber Ensemble was renamed Oakville Ensemble.
Currently, the Ensemble has a sixteen-voice chamber choir and an orchestra and delivers six to eight concerts per season at various churches in Oakville performing works from the past (Bach, Byrd, Haydn) and present, including works by Canadian composers, such as Srul Irving Glick, Donald Patriquin, and upcoming composer Jared Hynnes.
