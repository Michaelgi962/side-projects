Logovisual technology

The term logovisual technology was introduced c. 2000 (Blake, Varney 1999) as a generic description for methods that structure texts to aid thinking. It arose in relation to a particular history of research and development with applications in education and management.
The structuring of texts considered in LVT is based on distinguishing three kinds of element. These are:
• Elementary units of meaning
• Their combinations
• Their framing
History.
The particular history began in the 1960s with the invention of structural communication by John G. Bennett and his colleagues. Structural Communication was devised to simulate the process of a small group tutorial in higher education. It introduced the generation and use of ‘semantic units’ relevant to a topic: a given text was articulated into a set of discrete statements. Operations on this set then provided a means of two-way communication based on combinations of the discrete units. The combinations enabled communication of ‘information about information’ that lent itself to discourse on e.g. the structure of ideas. (Donald McKay defined ‘structural information’ as information about how to interpret messages (N. Katherine Hayles, 1999).)
Technological implementation of the method was primitive in the 60s. At that time, there were no personal computers, so there were only cumbersome means of performing operations on the discrete units of meaning.
In the 1980s a ‘magnetic technology’ was introduced. The ‘semantic units’ were written onto magnetic objects that could be attached and detached to any number of suitable surfaces. This enabled operations to be done physically. It also enabled them to be perfectly visible to a group of people, thus making it possible for members of a group to work together on the structuring of texts. This suited the needs of many kinds of management group and it was in this context that Centre for Management Creativity continued to develop the method.
In the 2000s a new step was made by recognising the significance of ‘framing’; that is, the form of the spaces in which units of meaning were placed and transferred between. Framing lent itself to computer technology in the guise of screens of display. The explicit use of frames enabled the method to go more deeply into the operations of writing and even change what might be considered as writing.
Intellectual Technology.
The position taken is that ‘thinking’ cannot be directly addressed by any technology, only the tangible operations or productions that stem from it, writing in particular. LVT is an intellectual technology (Warfield, 1976) that aims to streamline mental operations by facilitating recurrent actions of writing. By isolating such recurrent actions, and making them simpler and easier to execute, it is supposed that the mind is freed to be more creative.
"It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy books and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them."
Alfred North Whitehead, An Introduction to Mathematics
An intellectual technology makes certain operations explicit and therefore amenable to becoming more efficient. Such operations occur without any such technology in the ordinary process of thinking but are only implicit and therefore often confused and liable to interfere with each other. As an intellectual technology, LVT follows the principle of performing only one action at any one time. It separates operations into distinct times and places. John N. Warfield has described this separation conjecture as follows (Societal Systems, p. 63):
"Modeling may often be done by groups of individuals, contributing their own special knowledge to the development of a model. But human behavior in groups often involves a random mixing and overlapping of idea actions. Such random mixing does not lend itself to methodology that seeks to strengthen, sharpen, and facilitate each individual idea action. Instead the burden of attaining productivity tends to fall heavily on group leadership. This often creates an unmanageable situation which frustrates productivity. The separation conjecture speaks to this situation as follows: GREATER INTELLECTUAL PRODUCTIVITY CAN BE ACHIEVED BY BOTH GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS THROUGH CONSCIOUS SEPARATION OF MENTAL ACTIVITY INTO DISTINCT IDEA ACTIONS, EACH BEING CARRIED OUT WITH METHODOLOGY ESPECIALLY APPROPRIATE TO IT. Separation facilitates the development of associations and transformations needed for model development and application."
An intellectual technology can be seen as a special variant of the idea of artificial intelligence, but only in the sense of a facilitating mechanism for the thinking of humans rather than as an independent entity that ‘thinks’ in its own terms. LVT in particular bears some affinity to the Turing Machine and can be considered as analogous with it. In brief, a Turing machine is based on a linear tape that moves back and forth under a reading and writing head; while in LVT use is made of surfaces (or frames) in which material can be written in two dimensions. Data in the form of units of meaning can be written into spaces and moved or copied from them into other spaces but this requires human operators.
LVT is thus a technology that refines and amplifies what humans do, taking the place of a facilitator. This possibility has been explored in other directions such as in research into ‘dialogue games’ (Ravenscroft & Pilkington, 2000):
"Levin & Moore (1997) used the term dialogue-game to characterise observable patterns in human dialogue, which they called “Metacommunication Structures for Natural Language Interaction”. Examples of their games include Helping, Information-seeking, Information-probing and Instructing. A more prescriptive approach to dialogue games has been proposed by Mackenzie (1979), Carlson (1983) and Hintikka (1984), that have been reviewed by Walton (1984). This category of game assigns participant roles, specify goals of the interaction, and include rules that govern permissible dialogue moves for participants. Rules also specify the influence of moves on commitment stores, turn-taking and who has the initiative."
Dialogue games are one type of meaning game, games based on the meaning of elements that are constructed into new meanings by their conjunctions. One example of this corpus is known, after Herman Hesse, as the Glass Bead Game. Another striking example is 1000 blank white cards which can be viewed as an unconstrained form of LVT. Studies of the general principles of meaning games have been incorporated into LVT (A. G. E. Blake, 2008).
Formal Operations of Writing in LVT.
The formal operations of LVT derive from those discernible in any instance of ‘writing from thinking’.
In ordinary writing, text is produced linearly on the horizontal and lines are contingently arranged in stacks, vertically. In poetry, lines have their own intrinsic length and are clearly separated vertically. In technical fields, it is a common practice to write ideas or statements vertically as in bullet points.
There are arbitrary constraints of size of page.
Chunks of text are divided up as in the conventions of the paragraph. There are useful devices such as headings that can title a chunk of text or a set of chunks.
These familiar structures are refined to enable the systemic approach of LVT.
The writing of text is subject to various types of order.
1. Text is articulated into discrete units called ‘molecules of meaning’ (MMs) that can be treated as distinct objects.
2. MMs are arrayed according to different types of order such as:
• In series
• In stacks
• In sets
3. MMs and/or their combinations (in orders) are placed in different frames. A frame is a bounded two-dimensional surface that can contain a number of MMs and has its own meaning.
‘Writing’ is not only the production of words but includes the movement of MMs from one frame to another. The meaning of any MM is dependent not only on what it states but also on what other MMs it is combined with and what kind of frame it is situated in. A frame is analogous to a frame of reference as used in physics.
The arbitrary character of the written page is replaced by a set of operations within a system that follows the intrinsic meaning of what is being said to produce an intentionally structured text. It is therefore akin to poetry and mathematics.
Comprehension of Text.
Reading and writing have some correlation with intelligence. It appears, for example, that reading classical texts can at least temporarily increase intelligence because they are highly coherent in their composition. LVT focuses on the operations that create structure. It is a compositional technique that also aids intelligent reading.
The comprehension of text or reading involves many levels from visual acuity to intellectual grasp of complex arguments. LVT takes into account that in any one ‘moment’ of an act of comprehension a reader can grasp only four or five items, but also makes use of the fact that the items can range from single characters to whole sections of text. What an ‘item’ – in LVT terminology, an MM – consists of can change from frame to frame.
The forming and handling of small groups of MMs on one level as one new kind of MM on another level is a critical operation. Such ‘chunks’ can be further chunked. The steps involved can be handled by the use of different frames.
In reading, there is both an immediate sense of a chunk on a certain level and also a ‘background’ sense of chunking on many levels. The background sense extends to what is sometimes called the synoptic sense of the whole text. There is both a movement from the most immediate and detailed parts of the text to build towards the whole, and also from the most all-embracing view towards the detail or specifics. It is the synoptic view that provides for a frame of reference within which ‘smaller’ MMs can be located. The structure of the synoptic view is not identical with the sequential order of exposition. It might even be called ‘unconscious’.
As reading proceeds, what has been read ceases to be immediate and becomes ‘latent’. By rendering MMs visible and capable of being stored in various frames they are made more accessible than relying on memory for re-viewing in the various contexts of other MMs.
The pragmatics of dealing in effect with only four or five MMs at a time is followed through in all the operations of LVT.
The relations between MMs on the different levels are multiple in kind and can never be reduced to any precise set of defined operations. The movement of these relations through various mental operations can be identified with thinking. LVT, like any technology, can only deal with relations that can be made visible and operations that are made tangible. But by improving on what can be dealt with in such a way, there can be an enablement of higher order thinking skills. In this guise, LVT has begun to attract the attention of educationists.
LVT also incorporates visual and kinesthetic elements that can assist children who are not at ease with verbal intelligence alone. The intellectual chunking of MMs is paralleled with a physical separation and placement. An important component of the information processed through LVT is topological.
Transformations.
The critical constraint in the system is to operate within a given set of elements (MMs) such that the same elements are structured in a series of ways, or are transformed. The central thesis of LVT is that new meaning can be generated out of sets of discrete elements (MMs) through combination and framing. This constitutes a form of rewriting. The structure of LVT is analogous to some mathematical structures, but is less rigorous. Analogy and analogical thinking in general plays a major role in LVT by providing exemplars of ways of interpretation such as of text, images or diagrams.
At its core is the property of the mind to take a set of many items as one item, sometimes called chunking. Such an operation is analogous to a mapping or conceptual metaphor or a transform (mathematics) and contains the kind of identity that can be expressed as N = 1, where N is the number of distinct MMs contained in the set and the 1 is the singular MM that expresses the reason for the grouping. Hence the singular new MM can be used to signify the whole group it names in further operations.
The three main types of transformation utilised in LVT are:
1. Originate. A given ‘text’ written in the ordinary continuous and linear manner is broken down and expressed clearly in a set of MMs. MMs are statements that are e.g. statements of fact, assertions, or propositions, etc. This distinguishes LVT from such practices as brainstorming and mindmapping. Often there is no apparent text but simply reference to ‘memory’ and ‘imagination’ or just ‘thinking about something’. The idea of a text is used in a very generalised way.
2. Combinate. The MMs are combined into sub-sets each of which can be identified with a distinct new meaning. The operation is called ‘combinate’ to emphasise its active character in organising ideas. It is distantly related to the mathematical structure of combinatorial hierarchy and more particularly to the study of multi-term systems introduced by John G. Bennett's systematics.
3. Integrate. These sub-sets are integrated together into a single composition (language). The verb ‘to integrate’ is used analogously with mathematical or computer usage as in producing the area under a linear curve, or as in system integration. The sub-sets are formed into serial order to produce a ‘curve’ that contains their order and content.
These three correspond to structures used in ordinary writing though not identical:
1. MMs correspond to sentences
2. Combined MMs correspond to paragraphs
3. Complete structures of MMs correspond to sections or chapters.
The arc of the total process begins in the relatively unstructured text and ends in a new version of the text. The final text can be written in standard form but will have underlying it a structure that renders it better formed.
Integrative Text.
Thinking in writing produces a series of ideas but also concerns connections of ideas transcendental to the series. The latter need to be recognised and articulated in their own right. It is often the relation of ideas that is more important than the ideas themselves.
This was addressed in the ancient method of ring composition. As explained by the anthropologist Mary Douglas, the method involved narrative or expository writing as if arranged in a circle. The symmetry of the conceptual arrangement naturally divided the discourse into two halves that mirrored each other. The axis of division ran ‘internally to the circle’ from what Douglas and other scholars call the latch, which unites beginning and end to the turn, which is the pivot or central meaning of the whole. (An example is Homer’s Iliad that ‘turns’ at the third night of the story). A reader capable of looking into the text as in such a circle was able to reflect on the cross-connections across the circle. Such connections could be made to contain the most significant ideas, though they would necessarily involve the active participation of the reader to make them appear.
In LVT, it is possible for people to rewrite their texts in such a form. This form enables them to reflect on ‘inner connections’ and generate new meanings; but also to experiment with and improve the coherence of the text in doing so. It is, therefore, a method of composition of structured texts.
There are parallels between LVT ring composition and ideas of dramatic structure such as the sequence of Gustav Freytag's pyramid: exposition - rising action - climax (or turning point)- falling action - dénouement.
Integrative texts are also figured in systems diagrams but the literary form of ring composition is preferred because it highlights the inner connections and it does this in a simple way.
An integrative text can be used to generate new meanings. It becomes a thinking apparatus that is more than a summation of previous thoughts.
Thinking in Groups.
The LVT method can be used by an individual but also has utility for ‘thinking in groups’. The reasons for this can be summarised:
• All members of the group work with the same ‘common’ language.
• Their thinking operations are rendered visible to each other.
• Texts are produced that can encode and store information about their dialogue.
The LVT process promotes democracy in the guise of equal participation, transparency (humanities) and the allied concept of emergence.
It contains free-floating conversation and association by enabling members of a group to verify that they are talking about the same thing; that is, to ground the conversation in shared, concrete and visible objects. It can be related to free association (psychology) but only in such contexts as social dreaming where the primary task is to generate new thinking.
Another link with psychology and the humanities is through the idea of the matrix as first described by S. H. Foulkes as:
"The hypothetical web of communication and relationship in a given group. It is the common shared ground that ultimately determines the meaning and significance of all events and upon which all communications and interpretations verbal and non-verbal rest."
The ‘structured text’ that can be produced by a group using LVT must be a representation of the matrix of the group. It is allied to reflective consciousness and self-knowledge, or metacognition.
LVT is a form of sensemaking. It enables the rewriting of the ‘story of the situation’ to better articulate meaningful connections between ‘molecules of meaning’ such as events and people in conditions of ambiguity that challenge current representations. Sensemaking is a two-way process between ‘data’ (as MMs) and frames of reference to articulate intelligent trajectories into the future.
Language, Vision and Touch (LVT).
The LVT framing of text forms a bridge between different modes of information-processing, such as first suggested by Roger Wolcott Sperry in terms of a contrast between left and right hemispheres of the brain. The left brain is dominantly linear, abstract, and verbal while the right is dominantly holistic, sensory, and pictorial. There may be conjectured to be three or more ‘brains’ to include a third, for example, devoted to handling physical objects in concrete space. The principle of three brains is encoded in the acronym LVT as ‘language, vision and touch’.
The precise, distinct steps of LVT which can be given exact algorithms are in practice interleaved with aspects of right brain performance. In terms of left brain thinking, these aspects are ‘random’ and have no logic. They concern seeing patterns and their meanings and they cannot be reduced to set rules. ‘Combinate’ makes no sense to the left brain besides being an efficient means of reducing complexity. Its positive content is only understood in the right brain.
The framing of text involves an elementary kind of drawing in that the arrangement of MMs and their combinations is both aesthetic and expressive. It is not putting ideas into pictures but seeing their relations through making shapes combining them.
The ‘third brain’ of physical sensory-movement gives us access to the organised dynamism of physical and animate objects and such objects – also their environments – can provide templates of understanding or forms of Integration. In this mode, they take the role of amplifications such as arise in psychotherapy which provide structure to contain and augment what has emerged by free association.
In LVT, it is the ‘third brain’ that enables a constructive relation between left and right or linguistic and visual brains. In its strict sense, LVT does not allow for extension of the visual into a ‘drawing one’s thought’ (Betty Edwards, 1986) and such a process would have to be introduced independently: learning how to draw one’s thoughts could contribute to fostering ability in combinating.
Historical Links.
Aspects of LVT are to be found in megalithic constructions, with their stones, alignments and circles which relate to patterns of number in the cosmos (Heath, 2005). This relates to LVT through the later textual device of ring composition. Ramon Llull’s wheels and Gottfried Leibniz’s characteristica universalis, often considered to be forerunners of computer science, were also prime examples of technologies of combinating.
Frances Yates's study of the 'theatre of memory' from classical to Renaissance times describes the organisation of knowledge through spatial visualisations. The Bektashi practice of making pictures out of calligraphy illustrates the principle of putting text into shapes. In a different mode, the Bauhaus school included exercises in sensory and spatial language.

Arshad al-Umari

Arshad Pasha al-Umari (1888–1978) () was born in Mosul, Iraq on April 8, 1888, when his father was Mayor of Mosul. He obtained his high school degree in 1904 when he was 16 years old. After finishing high school at Mosul he left for Istanbul, the capital of the Ottoman Empire, to complete his studies. He did the trip by horses via Aleppo to the port of Alexandretta on the Mediterranean Sea. Such a trip in those days took about 40 days. From Alexandretta he took the steamer to Istanbul where he was admitted to the Architectural Division of the Royal Engineering College. The teaching staff of the college were professors from Germany, Belgium and Austria.
He graduated as an architect in 1908 when he was 21 years old, and was appointed in the Architectural Division of the Municipality of Istanbul. When World War I broke out in 1914 he was conscripted as an engineer in the Ministry of Defense and when the war was over in 1918 he returned to the Municipality of Istanbul as Chief Engineer when Jamil Pasha Topuslu was Lord Mayor of Istanbul. He married Rafi'a Khanim, the younger sister of Jamil Pasha the Lord Mayor of Istanbul. Jamil Pasha and Rafi'a Khanim's father was Dhia Pasha who occupied several prominent positions in the Ottoman Empire, the most important of which was the personal supervision of the renovation of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, ordered by the Sultan Abdul Hamid II. He lived with his family several years in Jerusalem to carry out this job.
Career.
After World War I when the Arab countries including Iraq were separated from the Ottoman Empire, al-Umari returned from Istanbul to Mosul, in 1919, with his wife, where he was appointed chief engineer of the Municipality of Mosul and continued until 1924. During this period his four children, Suad, Frozan (Suzy), Issam and Imad were born in Mosul.
In 1924 he was elected a member of the first Parliament of Iraq after the formation of the national government of Iraq under King Faisal I. From 1925 through 1931 he was Director General of Post and Telegraph, and from 1931 to 1933 Lord Mayor of Baghdad.
On the formation of the Red Crescent he was elected President of the society and continued holding that position until 1958, more than 25 years.
In 1933 he was Director General of Irrigation, and from 1934 to 1935 he was Minister of Public Works. During his Ministership the opening of the famous oil pipeline from the oilfields at Kirkuk to the Mediterranean over was celebrated. In 1935 he was Director General of Municipalities. From 1936 till 1944 he was Lord Mayor of Baghdad for a second time. The city planning and the general layout of the present modern Baghdad were one of his great achievements of the period. From June 4, 1944 to August 25, 1945 he was Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Minister of Defense and Supply. During his Ministership of Foreign Affairs, diplomatic relations were established with the USSR and letters were exchanged between him and Vyacheslav Molotov on September 11, 1944. Also during his Ministership, the Arab League was formed and he headed the Iraqi delegations to Cairo, Egypt, and signed the Charter of the Arab League on March 22, 1945.
al-Umari headed the Iraqi delegation to sign the United Nations charter at San Francisco, California. On the arrival of the delegation to New York, President Franklin Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945. al-Umari headed the Iraqi delegation at the funeral on April 14, 1945.
On April 26 the San Francisco Conference consisting of 50 nations met to discuss the draft of the United Nations Organization. al-Umari, the head of the Iraqi delegation, in protest against the apparent intention of the great powers to partition the British Mandate of Palestine into a Jewish State and an Arab State, refused to sign the charter and left the conference returning to Iraq on June 13, 1945. On June 26 the Charter was signed. Dr. Fadhil Al-Jamali signed on behalf of Iraq.
After his return to Iraq, al-Umari resigned from the cabinet as Minister of Foreign Affairs on August 25, 1945. From June 4 to December 14, 1946 he was Prime Minister of Iraq for the first time.
From January 29 to June 23, 1948 he was Minister of Defense. In 1952 he was selected to be the Executive Vice-President of the Development Board. The Development Board was formed to undertake the study and execution of major construction schemes such as the Darbandikhan Dam on the Diyala River, the Dukan Dam on the Little Zab, the Bekhme Dam on the Great Zab, the Samarra Dam on the Tigris and the Lake Tharthar flood protection scheme connected with it, the Mosul Dam on the Tigris, the network of modern highways connecting major cities in Iraq, a great number of hospitals, schools and other public institutions.
In April 1954, he became Prime Minister of Iraq for the second time. In 1958, at the age of 70, he retired to his favorite city of Istanbul. He returned to Iraq in 1968 and spent the rest of his life at the Baghdad residence of his elder son, Dr. Issam ul-Umari. He died in Baghdad in 1978 at the age of 90 and was buried at the family cemetery in Mosul.

Adam Crooks (politician)

Adam Crooks LLB (December 11, 1827 – December 28, 1885) was an Ontario Member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario for Toronto West from 1871 to 1874 and moved to the riding of Oxford South from 1875 to 1886. Crooks was an MLA for the Ontario Liberal Party
Crooks was born in West Flamboro, Ontario, the son of James Crooks. He studied at Upper Canada College and the University of Toronto. During his time in Toronto, he studied law and was called to the bar in 1851. During the early 1860s, he successfully appealed a lower court decision against the Commercial Bank of Canada before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in England. In 1863, he was named Queen's Counsel. He served as Attorney General from 1871 to 1872 and provincial treasurer from 1872 to 1877. Crooks played a major role in developing the 1876 liquor licence act, also known as the Crooks Act, which attempted to control the sale of alcohol within the province. He also served as the first Minister of Education in Ontario, appointed in 1876, after the retirement of Rev. Dr. Egerton Ryerson, who was Chief Superintendent. Near the end of his life, he suffered from problems with his physical and mental health and was forced to retire from public life. He died in Hartford, Connecticut.

Qardaha

Qardaha ( / ALA-LC: "Qardāḥah") is a village in northwestern Syria, in the mountains overlooking the coastal town of Latakia. Nearby localities include Kilmakho to the west, Bustan al-Basha to the southwest, Harf al-Musaytirah to the southeast and Muzayraa to the north. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics, Qardaha had a population of 8,671 in 2004. It has a predominantly Alawite population and is the traditional home of the Assad family, which has ruled Syria since 1970. 
President Hafez al-Assad, who ruled from 1970 to 2000, was born in Qardaha. Under Assad, the government poured massive investments into Qardaha, Lattakia and the surrounding region. Today, this is evident already before entering Qardaha, as the broad Syrian coastal highway makes an inexplicable pass into the mountains just to reach Qardaha. Qardaha has a lot of luxurious villas. Major families in Qardaha: Al-Assad, al-Khayer, Othman, Shalish, Ismail, Jabbour, Maaliki, Nassif, Hatem, Suleiman, Deeb, Kina'an, Makhlouf, Aslan, Jarkas. A major statue of Hafez al-Assad is found in the town center, and a huge mausoleum containing the graves of Basil al-Assad and Hafez al-Assad is also located there. Hasan al-Khayer was also born in Qardaha.
History.
The Aramaic meaning of Qardaha is the first village. The name of Qardaha is Phoenician and means "the place that manufactures, and sharpens the weapons". Several of the villages and places situated in the Coastal Mountain Range have names that were originally Phoenician. 
It is said among the Circassian people of Syria that the town of Qardaha was actually founded by Circassians during the time of the Mamluk sultan Qansuh al-Ghawri. Evidence for this can be seen by the large number of Circassians that live in the town and the entire Alawite Mountain region. There is even a street named Cherkess Street as well as a large family of the same name. Qardaha in the Circassian language means "Welcome".
The residents of Qardaha descended from the Kalbiyya tribal confederation and the town served as the confederation's principle center. During the late Ottoman era, between 1840 and 1880, tensions between the authorities and the Alawite tribes of the coastal mountains increased sharply. In 1854 the Ottoman governor of the Latakia Sanjak ("Latakia District") was killed in armed confrontation between the authorities and members of the Qardaha-based tribe. This emboldened the Kalbiyya fighters, who proceeded to launch more raids against Ottoman positions, which the authorities responded to harshly. 
Fear of attracting the attention and subjugation of the authorities, and to avoid taxation and military conscription, was one of the reasons many of the Alawite fellahin ("peasants") who lived in the vicinity of Qardaha, opted not to establish an agglomeration of settlement. Until the present day, Qardaha is surrounded by scattered rural hamlets. The town formerly had a significant Christian population until the mid to late 20th-century, when most Christian families left for the major coastal cities. 
In 1970 Qardaha was given city status, along with al-Shaykh Badr and Duraykish. Together they made up around 6% of the total urban population of the two coastal governorates, Latakia and Tartus. The three towns were also designated the seats of newly formed districts ("mantiqah") centered around them. According to French anthropologist Fabrice Balanche, the Ba'athist government which gained power in the 1960s, displayed a degree of favoritism for the three towns, all of which were Alawite, and Qardaha specifically. She particularly pointed to the fact that the subdistricts ("nahiya") of al-Qadmus and Mashta al-Helu, predominantly Ismaili and Christian, respectively, were slated to become districts when each of their populations passed the 60,000 threshold, although the subdistricts of Qardaha, al-Shaykh Badr and Duraykish all had less than 40,000 inhabitants. 
On 24 April 2013, the village was attacked with a barrage of rockets launched by rebels during the Syrian civil war.

Earl Robinson

Earl Hawley Robinson (July 2, 1910 – July 20, 1991) was a singer-songwriter and composer from Seattle, Washington. Robinson is probably as well remembered for his left-leaning political views (a member of the Communist Party in the 1930s) as he is for his music, including the songs "Joe Hill", "Black and White", and the cantata "Ballad for Americans". In addition, he wrote many popular songs and was a composer for Hollywood films.
Career in music.
He studied violin, viola and piano as a child, and studied composition at the University of Washington, receiving a BM and teaching certificate in 1933. In 1934 he moved to New York City where he studied with Hanns Eisler and Aaron Copland. He was also involved with the depression-era WPA Federal Theater Project, and was actively involved in the anti-fascist movement and was the musical director at the Communist-run Camp Unity in upstate New York. In the 1940s he worked on film scores in Hollywood until he was blacklisted for being a Communist. Unable to work in Hollywood, he moved back to New York, where he headed the music program at Elisabeth Irwin High School, directing the orchestra and chorus.
Musical works.
Robinson's musical influences included Paul Robeson, Lead Belly, and American folk music. He composed "Ballad for Americans" (lyrics by John La Touche) which became a signature song for Robeson. It was also recorded by Bing Crosby. He wrote the music for and sang in the short documentary film "Muscle Beach" (1948), directed by Joseph Strick and Irving Lerner.
Other songs written by Robinson include "The House I Live In" (a 1945 hit recorded by Frank Sinatra), "Joe Hill" (a setting of a poem by Alfred Hayes, which was later recorded by Joan Baez and used in the film of the same name), the ongoing ballad that accompanied the film "A Walk in the Sun" that was sung by Kenneth Spencer, a musical poem on the life and death of Abraham Lincoln entitled "Lonesome Train", and "Black and White", with David I. Arkin, the late father of actor Alan Arkin, a celebration of the "Brown v. Board of Education" decision, which has been also recorded by Pete Seeger, Three Dog Night, Jamaican reggae band The Maytones, UK reggae band Greyhound and Sammy Davis Jr. His late works included a concerto for banjo, as well as a piano concerto entitled "The New Human". His cantata based on the preamble to the constitution of the United Nations was premiered in New York with the Elisabeth Irwin High School Chorus and the Greenwich Village Orchestra in 1962 or 1963.
He was killed at the age of 81 in a car accident in his hometown of Seattle in 1991.
The jazz clarinettist Perry Robinson is his son.

A war fan is a fan designed for use in warfare. Several types of war fans were used by the samurai class of feudal Japan. They are also referred to as tessen (鉄扇, literally "iron fan(s)").
War fans varied in size, materials, shape, and use. One of the most significant uses was as a signalling device. Signalling fans came in two varieties: a real fan that has wood or metal ribs with lacquered paper attached to the ribs and a metal outer cover; and a solid open fan made from metal and/or wood, very similar to the "gunbai" used today by sumo referees. The commander would raise or lower his fan and point in different ways to issue commands to the soldiers, which would then be passed on by other forms of visible and audible signalling.
"War fans" could also be used as weapons. The art of fighting with war fans is tessenjutsu.

Rotring

Rotring is a German technical writing and drawing instruments company based in Hamburg.
History.
The company was established in 1928 as Tintenkuli Handels GmbH. The company's first product was the Tintenkuli, a stylographic pen—a fountain pen with a narrow steel tube instead of a conventional nib. While stylographic pens were already common in America and in fact pre-dated conventional fountain pens, they had not been previously marketed in Europe, and Rotring would eventually become the name associated with such pens throughout the world. 
"Rot ring" literally means red ring - which is still placed around the barrel of their pens today. The company's name was changed to Rotring in the early 70s to match the trademark. 
Although stylographs never overtook fountain pens for use in writing, by 1953 the Rotring Rapidograph became the prototypical technical pen of its age. Its technology virtually replaced the ruling pen and greatly simplified technical drawing. Rapidographs are still made today, both by Rotring and by Koh-i-Noor, its US subsidiary.
The advent in the 1990s of computer-aided design (CAD) saw the partial demise of the technical drawing pen. To combat this, Rotring diversified its range of graphic pens, pencils and markers. 
In 1998 Rotring was taken over by Sanford, an American company specialising in graphic products and part of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. since 1992

Rene Mederos

Felix René Mederos Pazos (20 November 1933 – 24 September 1996) was a prominent Cuban poster artist and graphic designer.
Mederos, a self-taught artist from Sagua la Grande, began work in a Havana printshop in 1944 and was appointed Chief Designer for Cuba's principal television station in 1959. In 1964, at the beginning of the new wave of Cuban graphic design, Mederos began creating his first posters as head of the design team of the propaganda organization Intercommunications.
In 1969 Mederos was assigned by DOR (The Department of Revolutionary Orientation) to travel to Vietnam to paint scenes of the war. He travelled to both North and South Vietnam along the Ho Chi Minh trail with the liberation forces, experiencing first-hand the brutal conditions of war and the courageous response of the Vietnamese people. The paintings were exhibited in Hanoi, and were subsequently reproduced as a screenprinted series which has been shown all over the world. Another trip in 1972 added to the body of work. Several of these images were reproduced in the United States as part of the anti-war and Cuba solidarity efforts and in Cuba as a set of postage stamps. He also contributed to the solidarity posters produced by OSPAAAL (Organization of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa, and Latin America) which enjoyed worldwide distribution through the magazine "Tricontinental". 
In 1973 Mederos created a series of "vallas" (12-sheet billboards) on the history of the Cuban Revolution as well as a series of screenprints commemorating the 20th anniversary of the assault on the Moncada, the event signaling the beginning of the armed resistance to the Batista government. He continued to design "vallas" and posters for DOR and its successor Editora Politica (EP) on a wide range of domestic and international issues. 
In 1991 Mederos visited the United States for the first time, where he designed and painted a mural at UCLA on U.S.–Vietnam solidarity. His last major project was a 14-panel portable mural series on Che Guevara.
Mederos died of cancer in Havana in 1996. His style, with its bright, firmly contoured surfaces, its ebullience of patterns in nature, and a strong, political theme, established a unique standard for graphic design in Cuba which influenced a whole generation of graphic artists all over the world.

Sinigrin

Sinigrin is a glucosinolate that belongs to the family of glucosides found in some plants of the Brassicaceae family such as Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and the seeds of black mustard ("Brassica nigra") to name but a few. Whenever sinigrin-containing plant tissue is crushed or otherwise damaged, the enzyme myrosinase degrades sinigrin to a mustard oil (allyl isothiocyanate), which is responsible for the pungent taste of mustard and horseradish. Seeds of white mustard, "Sinapis alba", will give a much less pungent mustard because this species contains a different glucosinolate, sinalbin.
The chemical name of sinigrin is allylglucosinolate or 2-propenylglucosinolate.

Narsingh Deonarine

Narsingh Deonarine (born 16 August 1983 in Berbice) is a West Indian cricketer of Indo-Guyanese ethnicity.
He is a left-handed batsman who bowls a right-arm off break. He made his debut for Guyana at the age of 17, and after captaining the West Indies under 19 team in 2002, he made headlines after hitting a century against the touring Australians the following year. Deonarine then had a spell in England with Whitehaven Cricket Club in 2004. He first came into the West Indies squad after contract disputes saw seven players left out of the South African Test of March 2005. Similarities in the fielding techniques and skill at cover point exist between Deonarine and his team-mate Shivnarine Chanderpaul—a man who Deonarine has clearly modelled his game on.
Narsingh's claim to fame came on 13 August 2006 at the Stanford 20/20 finals which saw Guyana vs. Trinidad in a classic million dollar match. After Trinidad put up a formidable 176 runs, Guyana answered back with 171 with 2 balls remaining. Narsingh was at the striker's end with Ramnaresh Sarwan at the bowlers end. Narsingh hit a 6 to win it for Guyana, capping one of the most exciting comebacks in the history of 20 over cricket. He was later rewarded with the Play of the Match award for his million dollar 6, and a hefty cheque of $25,000.
He returned to the West Indies Test team for the Third Test against Australia at Perth on 16 December 2009 after both Chanderpaul and Adrian Barath were ruled out due to injury. Deonarine promptly claimed his best bowling in Tests with 2/72. He also made his first Test 50 and finished up with 82, his highest Test score.
On 15th November, 2013, Narsingh claimed the wicket of Sachin Tendulkar, who was playing his final innings in his 200th Test match prior to retiring from all forms of cricket.

Sec61

Sec61 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein translocator (aka translocon). It is a doughnut shaped pore through the membrane with 3 major subunits (heterotrimeric). It has a region called the plug that blocks transport into or out of the ER. This plug is displaced when the hydrophobic region of a nascent polypeptide interacts with another region of Sec61 called the seam, allowing translocation of the polypeptide into the ER lumen.

List of Los Angeles bike paths

Los Angeles County's Class I Bike Paths are explicitly defined in Chapter 1000 of the Highway Design Manual (HDM) published by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) as paths that are completely separate from traffic. These are distinct from Class II Bike Lanes (on-street marked bike lanes) and Class III Bike Routes (a street with signs denoting that it is a bicycle route; the street may also have sharrows.) These bike paths are completely uncovered by any warranties as to fitness for safe cycling. This is in direct contrast to ordinary city streets. There are two pieces of case law which establish this clearly, one of them being "Prokop v. City of Los Angeles." 
It is legal in Los Angeles to ride on sidewalks as long as riders do not show "wanton disregard" for the safety of other sidewalk users. In California, when mounted and riding on the road, cyclists are required to 'behave like vehicles' when it comes to obeying signals, signage, and lane restrictions (see the "California Driver Handbook" for details). In brief: Ride with lane position appropriate to own speed, traffic flow, and destination. For example, in the right third of the lane when traveling slower than other traffic. In the center of the lane when traveling the speed of traffic or at any intersection (e.g., stoplight, stop sign). In the left turn lane when making a left turn.

Aveland

Aveland was a Wapentake of Kesteven from the time of the Danelaw until the Local Government Act 1888. Its meeting place was The Aveland at in the parish of Aslackby.
Origins.
Aveland was probably established as an administrative unit soon after 921 when Edward the Elder ably assisted until 918, by Æthelflæd had restored English rule in the part of the Danelaw represented by Kesteven. The wapentake included the parishes of Aslackby, Bourne, Dembleby, Dowsby, Dunsby, Folkingham, Haconby, Haceby, Horbling, Kirkby Underwood, Laughton, Morton, Newton, Osbournby, Pickworth, Pointon, Rippingale, Sempringham, Spanby, Swaton, Threekingham and Walcot; some of which have since been amalgamated.
There is documentary evidence for a settlement called Avethorpe, from the Domesday survey onwards, but no actual location is known.
Decline.
Between 921 and 1888, the administrative significance of the wapentake was reduced by many small steps. The first was as a result of the invasion of England by Swein in 1013. The Kesteven people supported it so that, when order was restored, the shire of Lincoln was set up and given powers over the wapentakes. Subsequently, piecemeal, privileges were given to lords of the manors in Aveland so that it became progressively less significant. By 1250, there was little power left. For the purposes of the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act, The territory of Aveland was included in the Union of Bourne.

Raptori is a rap group, formed 1989 in Hyvinkää, Finland. They were pioneers of Finnish rap music.
Raptori were both aggressive and humoristic at once, and often used counter-intuitive rhymes. During the last years of 1990s dozens of new Finnish rap groups appeared but Raptori was among the first. Raptori's first album, "Moe!", was highly successful, selling over 80 000 copies and yielding a number one single (on Finnish chart) "Oi Beibi". After their second album Raptori broke up (or at least left the scene) but they came back in 2000 and released their third album. The band made yet another comeback in 2010 and released new compilation album "Sekoelma" which included one new song and two remixes of old songs.
In the mid-1990s, Ismo Tapio Heikkilä and Juho Peltomaa formed a band called Allekirjoittanut with Tommi Lindell. They have released one album, "Generation Å." A fellow Raptori member, Tero Tapio Kaikkonen, also appeared on that release.

Church Stretton railway station

Church Stretton railway station serves the town of Church Stretton in Shropshire, England. The station is situated on the Welsh Marches Line, south of Shrewsbury railway station, while trains on the Heart of Wales Line also serve the station. All trains serving the station are operated by Arriva Trains Wales, who also manage the station.
The station lies on the highest point of the line between Shrewsbury and Craven Arms, and is the highest station in Shropshire. There is on the northbound platform a small plinth noting the station's altitude: above sea level.
History.
The station opened on 20 April 1852 as part of the newly created Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway along with the rest of the line and stations. It was originally situated to the north of (what is now known as) Sandford Avenue and the old station building still remains, but is no longer in railway use. Sandford Avenue had been for centuries called Lake Lane and became Station Road with the arrival of the railway in the town, before becoming Sandford Avenue in 1884. The original station building was designed by Thomas Mainwaring Penson.
In 1914 the station was relocated just to the south of the Sandford Avenue road bridge, where it continues to the present day. New station buildings were erected, but these were demolished in 1970, the station having become unstaffed in 1967. Today the only station structures in use are two passenger shelters on the platforms and a footbridge.
Today's station.
The station has two platforms, one for northbound services (platform 1) and the other for southbound services (platform 2), with a footbridge crossing the line connecting the two platforms. The platform shelters were replaced and electronic information displays were installed in the spring of 2011. CCTV was also installed at the time and together with the new shelters has resulted in anti-social behaviour becoming almost non-existent at the station. In 2013 a ticket machine was installed at the station, on platform 1.
There are two small areas for car parking/dropping off, on either side of the line – one can be accessed from Sandford Avenue (the B4371), the other from Crossways (which comes off the A49).
Volunteering.
The station has been "adopted" by local volunteers and is regularly kept tidy by them, including the garden areas behind both platforms. In 2008 a group of volunteers undertook to transform the unattended station gardens and two years later were awarded the Station Gardens of the Year competition. In 2011 a tree sculpture depicting two owls was carved by David Bytheway. There is also the Church Stretton Rail Users' Association.
Services.
For a town of its size, Church Stretton is comparatively well served by trains, although services are less frequent on Sundays. A number of passenger services operating on the Welsh Marches Line do not stop at Church Stretton, particularly on weekdays (Monday to Friday).
On weekdays, northbound trains run to Shrewsbury, and most continue to ultimate destinations such as Manchester Piccadilly, Holyhead etc. Southbound trains mostly run to Cardiff Central or beyond via the Welsh Marches Line, but four run to Swansea via the Heart of Wales Line.
Passenger use.
The station has a large number of passengers using it considering the town has a population of just 3000; it is the 7th most-used station in Shropshire (the fifth for the Shropshire Council area). The high usage can be explained by two reasons: the town is a popular tourist destination and many of its inhabitants travel to Shrewsbury and Ludlow for employment, education and shopping.
Infrastructure.
The track through the station is prone to flooding when heavy rain occurs as, although at the apex of the line, it is at the bottom of the valley which Church Stretton is found in. (Church Stretton effectively lies at a saddle point.) At one stage during the infamously wet autumn of 2000, the space between the two platforms resembled a canal and train services had to be cancelled along the line.
Following the serious flooding of the railway line in 2000, the signal box at Church Stretton (which was situated to the north of the Sandford Avenue bridge) was "switched out". The signal box at Church Stretton closed entirely in 2004 and the set of points at the station lay defunct for a number of years and were removed in 2009, together with the box (built 1872) and all signals. The control of the line here has been transferred to Marsh Brook signal box, which is to the south.
Bus connections.
Church Stretton is served by the 435 bus route (the Shrewsbury-Ludlow service), run by Minsterley Motors, which runs Monday-Saturday. This connects the town with some nearby villages including All Stretton, Dorrington, Leebotwood, Little Stretton and Marshbrook. In addition there are two Shropshire Hills Shuttles services that operate at weekends and on Bank Holidays during the spring and summer. One route runs over the Long Mynd to Ratlinghope & Bridges, Stiperstones, Habberley, Pulverbatch, Minsterley and Pontesbury. The other route, called the "Wenlock Wanderer", runs to Much Wenlock via Little Stretton, Marshbrook, Acton Scott, Ticklerton and then along the B4371 which runs atop the Wenlock Edge to the market town of Much Wenlock. Bus services run to and from Beaumont Road, from the station ().

Army ranks of the Japanese Empire during World War II

The following tables present the rank insignia of the Japanese military before and during World War II. These designs were worn on shoulders as passants between the years 1911 and 1938, then on collars afterwards until 1945, when the Imperial Japanese Army was dissolved.
The same officer ranks were used for both the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy, the only distinction being the placement of the word "Rikugun" (Army) or "Kaigun" (Navy) before the rank. Thus, for example, a Captain in the navy shared the same rank designation as that of a Colonel in the Army-"Taisa" (Colonel), so the rank of ""Rikugun Taisa"" denoted an Army Colonel while the rank of ""Kaigun Daisa"" denoted a Naval Captain.

Belmont, Nevada

Belmont is a ghost town in Nye County, Nevada, United States. The town is a historic district listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It is Nevada Historical Marker number 138.
History.
Belmont was established following a silver strike in 1865. Other minerals, such as copper lead and antimony, were also mined in addition to the silver. The boom brought settlers in and the town of Belmont grew. In 1867, Belmont became the county seat of Nye County. The town boasted four stores, two saloons, five restaurants, livery stable, post office, assay office, bank, school, telegraph office, two newspapers, and a blacksmith shop. As the price of metals fluctuated, so did the fortunes of the town. By 1887, several of the mines closed. In 1905, the county seat of Nye County was relocated from Belmont to Tonopah. The mine dumps were reworked in the early part of the 20th century
During the 1870s it was known as a major mining boomtown producing silver, and was rumored to have a population of 15,000. Like many towns which are now ghost towns, this one lasted for only a short time. There was also a man named Jaren Smith who walked on water and ate raccoon, he was a well known staple in the town of Belmont.
2009.
Some of the buildings are still standing, including the courthouse, the Cosmopolitan Saloon, the Monitor-Belmont Mill, and the combination mill.
Currently there are plans to renovate the boomtown into a small city. The plans have yet to be finalized due to the fact that the site is on government property. To the south of the site there is the Belmont Courthouse State Historic Park.

Memories of the Ford Administration

Memories of the Ford Administration is a 1992 novel by John Updike published by Knopf.
Plot introduction.
Set in the early 1990s, it concerns a historian and teacher, Alfred Clayton, and his response to a national survey requesting "memories and impressions" of the administration of Gerald Ford. The novel is presented as Clayton's improbably long and incredibly personal response, submitted to his professional association, the Northern New England Association of American Historians (NNEAAH). (Clayton teaches at a junior college in New Hampshire.)
Major themes.
Clayton idealizes the Ford years and the sexual freedom they represented, and the novel cuts between his memories of the 1970s and scenes from his uncompleted biography of James Buchanan, which he was writing at the time. Although Buchanan's life and times are discussed in great detail, to the point where Clayton (and Updike) crosses over into the realm of imagined thoughts and dialogue, there is next to nothing said about Ford or his administration in the novel. Rather, the Ford-era part of Clayton's memories center almost entirely on the professor's personal life, above all his romantic involvement with the wife of an English teacher on campus. Sexual encounters are described in loving detail, leaving the reader to think that Clayton must be off his rails to be enumerating such dalliances before members of the NNEAAH. And he is off his rails in another way, too, namely, in being unable to constrain himself in writing about Buchanan, someone generally thought to have been rather a dud as a person and a president. Yet Clayton believes that Buchanan was largely wrongly blamed for bringing about the American Civil War through his weak leadership, and the historian questions how correct the general perception of Buchanan's character as related by most historians actually is. 
The novel is a tour de force in the genre of mixed history and fiction, or rather in the writerly craft of stretching historical description to (and beyond) its accepted limits. No one seems to know more about Buchanan than Clayton/Updike, and this apparently is one reason why Clayton never could finish his Buchanan biography: he simply could not imagine his subject in any but the most intimate of terms. Writing a standard biography would have been too objectifying an act. He needs the prompt of "memories and impressions" concerning another president to get him going.
Clayton also notes the way that sexual mores had changed during his lifetime, recalling that while in the 1970s it was considered common for teachers at colleges to engage in sexual liaisons with their female students, by the 1990s this was deemed to be totally unacceptable and even criminal behavior. He vaguely laments the loss, although now back with his wife in the era of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, and comes across as a chastened man.

United States of Colombia

The United States of Colombia () was the name adopted in 1861 through the Rionegro Constitution for the Granadine Confederation, modern-day Brazil, Colombia, Panama and Peru, following years of civil war.
History.
The civil war between 1860-1862 resulted in the dissolution of the Granadine Confederation which had been increasingly subjected to efforts by conservatives to centralize rule over the federal states.
The liberal leader, General Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera, defeated the conservative government of President Bartolomé Calvo in 1862 and was installed as new leader. Much power was distributed back to the states from the government in Bogotá.
In 1871, the drive for modernization and economic reform led to the Colombian peso being pegged to the French franc as part of the international gold standard.
Colombian Constitution of 1863.
Following the reforms of earlier years, before the creation of the new federation, the liberals aimed to build the United States of Colombia upon a decentralized, free market system. As with previous liberal presidencies, such as de Mosquera's first two terms as president, a tough stance towards the Catholic Church was taken, much to the dismay of conservatives. Land held by the Church was seized and transferred to industrialists and the influence and rights of the Church was severely limited.
Abolition.
After several years of intermittent civil wars, in 1886 the Colombian Conservative Party led by President Rafael Núñez proclaimed a new constitution of centralist character that abolished the United States of Colombia and created the Republic of Colombia. The conservatives immediately withdrew Colombia from the gold standard and the subsequent increase of printed currency led to troubling inflation levels.
Meanwhile the new state would continue to be plagued by conflict between liberal and conservative factions, which eventually would lead to the secession of Panama in 1903.
States.
The nine original states that formed the confederation were:

Marvin Braude Bike Trail

The Marvin Braude Bike Trail, also known as The Strand, is a paved bicycle path that runs mostly along the Pacific Ocean shoreline in Los Angeles County, California. The northern terminus of the trail is a paved Class 1 bicycle path at Will Rogers State Beach in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles. The southern terminus of the trail is in Torrance County Beach in Torrance. The path is 22 miles (35 km) long, and the midpoint between the two ends of the path is near the southern end of the Playa del Rey residential area. 
The Strand was officially renamed in 2006 for Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude by State Senator Sheila Kuehl,
The Strand is not considered a "boardwalk" because it is not made out of wood boards.
Route.
The path begins in Will Rogers State Beach in the Pacific Palisades area of the city of Los Angeles. It continues southbound along the beach and passes through Santa Monica State Beach in the city of Santa Monica, where the path passes underneath the Santa Monica Pier. The Santa Monica portion of the path is an Class 1 path in Los Angeles County running from Temescal Canyon in the north to Washington Boulevard in Venice in the south. 
Realizing the success of paved bike paths in Europe, in the last decade of the nineteenth century, L.A. city planners proposed a bike path from Los Angeles to Santa Monica. The cost for the path was estimated at $200 per mile, with agreements from local farmers to allow the path to run across their lands.
The current path was proposed in the late 1960s and received final approval in 1988. The entire path is along the beach and was adamantly opposed by beachfront homeowners, who managed for two decades to stop the path from reaching Santa Monica. The last section of the path was opened in 1989.
The path then passes through Venice City Beach in Venice. The Class 1 bicycle path ends at the Venice Fishing Pier and riders must continue on the Class 2 bicycle path along Washington Boulevard. The Class 2 path eventually veers off of Washington Boulevard and takes riders around Marina Del Rey until it reaches a Class 1 path running alongside the main channel of the marina, an extension of the Ballona Creek bicycle path.
The path continues south through Dockweiler State Beach (which abuts Los Angeles International Airport and the city of El Segundo), El Porto Beach and Manhattan County Beach (both part of the city of Manhattan Beach).
In Hermosa Beach, riders have the choice of either continuing along the Class 1 bicycle path that runs alongside Hermosa City Beach (which can get quite busy with pedestrian foot traffic, especially during the summer months) or riding on a Class 2 bicycle lane that runs parallel to Hermosa Avenue.
The path continues along the beach through Redondo County Beach in the city of Redondo Beach. The path passes through the parking structure of the Redondo Beach pier. Signs instruct riders to dismount and walk their bikes across the main entrance to the pier and the King Harbor marina.
The path ends in Torrance County Beach, below a parking lot at the base of the Palos Verdes Peninsula hills.

Rum row

A rum row was a Prohibition-era term (1920-1933) referring to a line of ships loaded with liquor anchored beyond the maritime limit of the United States. The maritime limit was three miles prior to April 21, 1924, and 12 miles thereafter. These lines became established near major U.S. ports so that rum runners could load cargoes of alcoholic beverages from these freight ships and sneak them into port. This lucrative but dangerous business was often punctuated by murder, hijackings and other violent crimes. The cities were often in Florida at first and the product was rum from the Caribbean. However, as the importation of whiskey from Canada increased, rum rows became established in locations along all the coastlines of the U.S. Notable rum-row locations included the New Jersey coast (by far the largest), San Francisco, Virginia, Galveston, and New Orleans. Twenty American navy destroyers were turned over to the Coast Guard to fight rum runners.

Averruncator

An averruncator is a form of long shears used in arboriculture for averruncating or pruning off the higher branches of trees, etc.
Etymology.
The word averruncate (from Latin "averruncare", "to ward off, remove mischief") glided into meaning to weed the ground, prune vines, etc., by a supposed derivation from the Lat. "ab", "off", and "eruncare", "to weed out", and it was spelt aberuncate to suit this; but the "New English Dictionary" regards such a derivation as impossible.
Description.
An averruncator has a compound blade attached to a handle between five and eight feet long. The blades are closed with a rope and pulley, and they are opened with a spring.

Net output

Net output is an accounting concept used in national accounts such as the United Nations System of National Accounts (UNSNA) and the NIPAs, and sometimes in corporate or government accounts. The concept was originally invented to measure the total net addition to a country's stock of wealth created by production during an accounting interval. The concept of net output is basically "gross revenue from production "less" the value of goods and services "used up" in that production". The idea is that if one deducts intermediate expenditures from the annual flow of income generated by production, one obtains a measure of the net new value in the new products created.
Definition.
In national accounts, net output is equivalent to the gross value added during an accounting period when producing enterprises use inputs (labor and capital assets) to produce outputs. Gross value added is called "gross" because it includes depreciation charges or Consumption of fixed capital. The calculation is importantly influenced by the definition of expenditures and incomes included within the scope of "production" - some incomes and expenditures are included as "factor income" or "factor expenditure" directly related to production, other are not.
The calculation involves an accounting procedure of "grossing and netting" the revenues which enterprises obtain from their outputs of goods and services, in order to establish what the real value of those outputs is.
This procedure must consistently identify and distinguish between costs and revenues, and between materials or services used up, fixed assets and new outputs, according to a standard valuation. In national accounts, this is especially important because the inputs of one enterprise are the outputs of another, and vice versa; lacking a consistent procedure, double counting would result. In turn, the "grossing and netting" procedure assumes a value theory and a definition of the coverage of production. Once we have that, we can aggregate a multitude of prices to obtain a price for the total value of net output.
Components of net output.
The value of an aggregate net output is normally understood to be equal to the sum of 
In calculating net output for national accounts, government subsidies received by producing enterprises are normally subtracted from indirect tax levies paid by them during the same accounting period..
Net output and GDP.
The total net output of resident producers in a national economy is equal to Gross Domestic Product or GDP. Included in this total is the productive activity of government agencies and certain income-generating activities of households.
Input-output analysis.
In input-output analysis, disaggregated data on gross and net outputs of different economic sectors and sub-sectors is used to study the transactions between them. Thus, for example, a sector purchases inputs from several other sectors and sells outputs to several other sectors. By identifying the quantities of inputs and outputs involved, we can estimate what the effect will be of fluctuations in business activity within one sector, or group of sectors on the economy as a whole.
Criticism.
As mentioned, the calculation of net output requires a value theory, a way of grossing and netting, and techniques for aggregating the prices of transaction volumes in a consistent way. Obviously, there are many different ways of going about this, but normally a legal framework limits the number of variations possible or permitted (business accounts have to be audited and so on, to guarantee a fair statement of business operations within the law of the land). Nevertheless, the procedure for establishing net output can be contested.

Scotty's Junction, Nevada

Scotty's Junction is an Unincorporated community in Nye County, Nevada where State Route 267 meets with U.S. Route 95. It is named after Walter E. Scott (aka Death Valley Scotty, of nearby Scotty's Castle fame).
Nevada Public Radio maintains translator station K201BF in the area, retransmitting KNPR in Las Vegas on 88.1 FM.
Eleven people live in Scotty's Junction. A brothel (the "Shady Lady") and an old truck stop/campground are the only local businesses.
History.
Scotty's Junction was originally a stop on the Bullfrog Goldfield Railroad (BGR) at Sarcobatus Flat/Tolicha for the Bonnie Claire Mines and the town of Bonnie Claire. The BGR was a short-lived railroad and it along with the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad (LV&T) were acquired by the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad (T&T) and combined for the shortest route. Supplies to build Scotty's Castle were trucked from the Bonnie Claire Depot to the castle site. In fact, the last delivery this train would ever make would be construction supplies for Scotty's Castle, the tracks literally torn up and scrapped after this last delivery and the ties taken to the castle to be used for firewood.
The Scotty's Junction Earthquake of August 1, 1999, was a 5.6 magnitude temblor centered to the north.
The Timbisha Shoshone Homeland Act of 2000 provides for transfer to the Timbisha tribe of 2800 acres (11 km³) of land and an annual of ground water around Scotty's Junction.

Abandoned Love

"Abandoned Love" is a song written by Bob Dylan, recorded in 1975 but not released until 1985, on his compilation album "Biograph". It was originally recorded for inclusion on his 1976 album "Desire", but was dropped in favor of "Joey". "Abandoned Love" was written during Dylan's breakup with his then-wife Sara Lownds. Only one live performance of this song is known of, at the Bitter End cafe on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village on July 3, 1975, during a show with Ramblin' Jack Elliott. Paul Cable, in his book "Bob Dylan: His Unreleased Recordings" (New York: Schirmer Books, 1980), described this live version of the song as "Beautiful, eerie, easily as good as "Blonde on Blonde" lyrics and a tune that is unusual and perfect."

Cape Verdean Portuguese

Cape Verdean Portuguese () is the variety of Portuguese spoken in Cape Verde.
"Status".
While Cape Verdean Creole is the mother tongue of nearly all the population in Cape Verde, Portuguese is the official language. Creole is, therefore, used colloquially, in everyday usage, while Portuguese is used in official situations, at schools, in the media, etc. Portuguese and Creole live in a state of diglossia.
Portuguese is not spoken uniformly in Cape Verde. There is a "continuum" that reveals several aspects: greater or lesser education, greater or lesser exposure to Portuguese, greater or lesser frequency in Portuguese usage, etc.
There is no institution that regulates the usage of Portuguese in Cape Verde. Nevertheless, there are some empiric concepts about what is "correct" or "incorrect" concerning the way of speaking, resulting from:
Another interesting phenomenon is that, if by one side the Portuguese in Cape Verde has developed some specificities, on the other side, during the years of colonization the paradigmatic models were from European Portuguese, and as of today, the reference works (grammars, dictionaries, school manuals, etc.) are from Portugal. Therefore, we are in the presence of two movements in opposite directions that happen simultaneously: on one side the Portuguese spoken in Cape Verde moves toward a development of its own characteristics, and on the other side the European Portuguese standards are still making some pressure that slows down the development of a typically Cape Verdean variety.
Characteristics.
The Portuguese spoken in Cape Verde is based on the European Portuguese. That's not too surprising, due to the historical relationship between the two countries, and by the fact that the language standardizing instruments (grammars, dictionaries, school manuals) are based on standards from Portugal. However there are differences that in spite of being small are enough to set Cape Verdean Portuguese apart from European Portuguese. Despite some minor differences in the pronunciation by speakers of the northern and southern islands (see below), due to the small size of the territory one cannot say that there are dialectal divisions in the Portuguese spoken in Cape Verde, making up the Cape Verdean Portuguese on its whole a dialectal variety of Portuguese.
Phonetics.
In the phonetics, the Cape Verdean variety is close to the Portuguese one. Shown here are the more striking differences:
Orthography.
There are no differences between the orthography of European Portuguese and Cape Verdean Portuguese, because Cape Verdean Portuguese is based on European form.

Matt Pike

Matt Pike (born June 3, 1972) is an American rock musician best known as the guitarist of the influential doom metal band Sleep and the frontman of High on Fire. He is quite well known in the metal scene for never wearing a shirt during live performances.
History.
Pike moved to California after spending time in Military School while living with his mother in Golden, Colorado. Arriving in the Silicon Valley, he realized the hardcore punk and heavy metal scenes were more active than the ones in Denver. He made friends, attended shows, and eventually joined the sludge metal band Asbestosdeath. When playing around the Bay Area they developed a much heavier and slower sound. Dubbed doom metal by the press, the quartet soon gained a following and changed their name to Sleep.
Sleep.
When fellow Sleep guitarist Justin Marler decided to quit, Sleep became a power trio. The band's second album, "Sleep's Holy Mountain", illustrated Pike as a young Tony Iommi—Playing Black Sabbath-styled riffs that invariably made a profound impact on the developing stoner metal/doom metal scene.
As a result of the increased press, the band's demographic and following widened greatly, and major label deals soon began surfacing. However, instead of following a path to mainstream exposure, the band fled further underground, turning down countless major label deals and submitting the one-song, full-length "Jerusalem" in mid-1996. In 1997, the band called it quits after London Records refused to release the "Dopesmoker/Jerusalem" recordings and the pressure the members were experiencing became unbearable. Pike couldn't come to terms with the break-up and became depressed. He soon realized that his career as a musician was far from over, and began inviting people to jam in his garage. Deciding to work in a power trio again, he brought in Desmond Kensel (drums) and an old friend George Rice (bass) to play in his new band. Within six months, the jams were headed to fruition and (High on Fire) was developing from a simple need to play guitar again.
High on Fire.
From the ashes of Sleep rose Pike’s new band, High on Fire (HOF), and while his guitar tone remained largely the same, he began playing faster and more aggressively than Sleep. Pike handles both guitar and vocal duties in the band, as well as writing a bulk of the material. High on Fire have toured constantly since their inception.
Scum Angel/Kalas.
Pike was the frontman of the Bay Area psychedelic-metal band Kalas (formerly Scum Angel) that featured members of Econochrist, Samiam, and Cruevo. Pike set aside the guitar for Kalas, as they already featured two guitarists; his vocals were surprisingly melodic, especially compared to his snarling growls in High on Fire. After only releasing a self-titled album, Kalas split by October 2006.
Equipment.
Pike has only rarely changed his guitar setup since his time in Sleep. He played mainly Gibson Les Pauls through the first three High On Fire albums, including the cherry-sunburst Standard he used in his previous band. During the early years of Sleep, Pike used Laney and Orange Amps but Pike and Al Cisneros discovered the Matamp “Green” while on tour in England, which became their preferred amplifier. Between the touring cycle for Blessed Black Wings and Death Is This Communion, Pike teamed up with First Act to design a custom guitar. He, along with Bill Kelliher and Brent Hinds of Mastodon, designed a 9-stringed double-cutaway solid-body guitar, made of mahogany and maple. The bottom three strings (tuned to C, F, A# on Pike's guitar) are normal; however, the treble strings are doubled up, similar to a 12-string guitar, to provide a natural chorus effect and add depth to the sound. They are tuned to D#, G, C, with their adjacent strings tuned the same, making the overall tuning C-Standard.
A few photos online have shown him using his Laney amps and some Marshall amps as well. In the Sleep "Dragonaut" video, he was shown using a Hiwatt amplifier. Initially, the only other addition he made to his set up after Sleep was adding a Soldano X-77 Preamp (to add more gain) to the Green head. He eventually switched to a beefy Soldano SLO-100 Head during the Blessed Black Wings era.
Currently for Sleep, he has been only using two Soldano SLO-100s with different speaker cabinets at each show. He also has a Boss TU-3, a MXR Carbon Copy Analog Delay and an ABY box for switching between amp in his live signal chain.
As of, December 2011, Matt Pike and Lace Music Products announced the release of Pike's Signature pickup set, dubbed the “Dirty Heshers”.

Isaac Newton's religious views

Isaac Newton (25 December 1642 – 20 March 1727) was, as considered by others within his own lifetime, an insightful and erudite theologian. He wrote many works that would now be classified as occult studies and religious tracts dealing with the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Newton's conception of the physical world provided a stable model of the natural world that would reinforce stability and harmony in the civic world. Newton saw a monotheistic God as the masterful creator whose existence could not be denied in the face of the grandeur of all creation. Although born into an Anglican family, by his thirties Newton held a Christian faith that, had it been made public, would not have been considered orthodox by mainstream Christianity; in recent times he has been described as a heretic.
Christian orthodoxy.
Newton was born into an Anglican family three months after the death of his father, a prosperous farmer also named Isaac Newton. When Newton was three, his mother married the rector of the neighbouring civil parish of North Witham and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabus Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough. Isaac apparently hated Reverend Smith and had no relations with him during his childhood. His maternal uncle, the rector serving the parish of Burton Coggles, was involved in some part in the care of Isaac. Reverend Smith had studied previously at Trinity College.
During 1667 Newton was a Fellow at Cambridge, making necessary the commitment to taking Holy Orders within seven years of completion of his studies. Prior to commencing studies he was required to take a vow of celibacy and recognize the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England. Newton considered ceasing his studies prior to completion in order to avoid the ordination made necessary by law of King Charles II for all graduates. He later capitulated to his desire for exemption from the binding of the statute, in some way assisted in this by the efforts of Isaac Barrow, when in 1676 the then State Secretary Joseph Williamson changed the relevant statute of Trinity College to provide dispensation from this duty. Having foregone these duties, he embarked on an investigative study of the early history of the Church, during the 1680s succeeding into inquiries of the origins of religion instead, at about the same time as having developed a scientific view on motion and matter. Of "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica" he stated:
Newton's religious views developed as a result of participation in an investigative discourse with Nature (the nature of the world) and developed from the apparent dichotomy of biblical reality from the increasing revealing of the structure of reality from investigation, and the subsequent challenges these truths of nature posed toward established religion for Newton, especially in light of Christian scriptural belief. Unorthodoxy was made necessary for Newton, and those affiliated with him, by the need for rediscovery of a "" truth that had been hidden somewhere in the time of classical history. By this they might have the capacity to engage in open dialogue with an investigation into Nature. In this conflict of ecclesiastical order and the liberating effects of scientific enquiry, he and others turned to the "prisca" in all the security of a classical civilization having been supposedly founded on "bona fide" insights. So, for them, the truth lay within the perception of reality attained by Pythagoras and communicated, supposedly in a secret way, to a specific circle of people.
As is found among some of the established intellectuals of the Renaissance age, Newton believed that ancient philosophers and religious persons had gained insight into the truth of the nature of the world and universe, but this truth having become hidden within the language of the recording of the truth at the time and by later medieval scholars (Albertus Magnus, Arnold of Villanova and Roger Bacon) that required deciphering in order to be understood. The belief in the wisdom of the ancients, that thinking was intelligent and knowing in the civilization of classical religious figures (Jesus of Nazareth, the prophet Isaiah and Solomon) and writers (Plato and Democritus) is known as "prisca sapientia".
Like many contemporaries (e.g., Thomas Aikenhead) he lived with the threat of severe punishment if he had been open about his religious beliefs. Heresy was a crime that could have been punishable by the loss of all property and status or even death (see, e.g., the Blasphemy Act 1697). Because of his secrecy over his religious beliefs, Newton has been described as a Nicodemite.
According to most scholars, Newton was Arian, not holding to Trinitarianism. 'In Newton's eyes, worshipping Christ as God was idolatry, to him the fundamental sin'. As well as being antitrinitarian, Newton allegedly rejected the orthodox doctrines of the immortal soul, a personal devil and literal demons. Although he was not a Socinian he shared many similar beliefs with them. A manuscript he sent to John Locke in which he disputed the existence of the Trinity was never published. In a minority view, T.C. Pfizenmaier argued Newton was neither "orthodox" nor an Arian, but that, rather, Newton believed both of these groups had wandered into metaphysical speculation. Pfizenmaier also argued that Newton held closer to the Eastern Orthodox view of the Trinity rather than the Western one held by Roman Catholics and Protestants. However, S. D. Snobelen has argued against this from manuscripts produced late in Newton's life which demonstrate Newton rejected the Eastern view of the Trinity.
Newton refused "" before his death.
God as masterful creator.
Newton saw God as the masterful creator whose existence could not be denied in the face of the grandeur of all creation. Nevertheless he rejected Leibniz' thesis that God would necessarily make a perfect world which requires no intervention from the creator. In Query 31 of the "Opticks", Newton simultaneously made an argument from design and for the necessity of intervention:
This passage prompted an attack by Leibniz in a letter to his friend Caroline of Ansbach:
Leibniz' letter initiated the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence, ostensibly with Newton's friend and disciple Samuel Clarke, although as Caroline wrote, Clarke's letters "are not written without the advice of the Chev. Newton".
Clarke complained that Leibniz' concept of God as a "supra-mundane intelligence" who set up a "pre-established harmony" was only a step from atheism: "And as those men, who pretend that in an earthly government things may go on perfectly well without the king himself ordering or disposing of any thing, may reasonably be suspected that they would like very well to set the king aside: so, whosoever contends, that the beings of the world can go on without the continual direction of God...his doctrine does in effect tend to exclude God out of the world".
In addition to stepping in to re-form the solar system, Newton invoked God's active intervention to prevent the stars falling in on each other, and perhaps in preventing the amount of motion in the universe from decaying due to viscosity and friction. In private correspondence Newton sometimes hinted that the force of Gravity was due to an immaterial influence:
Leibniz jibed that such an immaterial influence would be a continual miracle; this was another strand of his debate with Clarke.
Newton's view has been considered to be close to deism and several biographers and scholars labeled him as a deist who is strongly influenced by Christianity. However, he differed from strict adherents of deism in that he invoked God as a special physical cause to keep the planets in orbits. He warned against using the law of gravity to view the universe as a mere machine, like a great clock. He said:
This most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent Being. [...] This Being governs all things, not as the soul of the world, but as Lord over all; and on account of his dominion he is wont to be called "Lord God" παντοκρατωρ or "Universal Ruler". [... The Supreme God is a Being eternal, infinite, absolutely perfect.
Opposition to godliness is atheism in profession and idolatry in practice. Atheism is so senseless and odious to mankind that it never had many professors.
On the other hand, latitudinarian and Newtonian ideas taken too far resulted in the millenarians, a religious faction dedicated to the concept of a mechanical universe, but finding in it the same enthusiasm and mysticism that the Enlightenment had fought so hard to extinguish. Newton himself may have had some interest in millenarianism as he wrote about both the Book of Daniel and the Book of Revelation in his Observations Upon the Prophecies.
In a manuscript he wrote in 1704 in which he describes his attempts to extract scientific information from the Bible, he estimated that the world could end on 2060. In predicting this he said, "This I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be, but to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fanciful men who are frequently predicting the time of the end, and by doing so bring the sacred prophesies into discredit as often as their predictions fail."
Newton's conception of the physical world provided a stable model of the natural world that would reinforce stability and harmony in the civic world.
The Bible.
Newton spent a great deal of time trying to discover hidden messages within the Bible. After 1690, Newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing with the literal interpretation of the Bible. In a manuscript Newton wrote in 1704 he describes his attempts to extract scientific information from the Bible. He estimated that the world would end no earlier than 2060. In predicting this he said "This I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be, but to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fanciful men who are frequently predicting the time of the end, and by doing so bring the sacred prophesies into discredit as often as their predictions fail."
Prophecy.
Newton relied upon the existing Scripture for prophecy, believing his interpretations would set the record straight in the face of what he considered to be, "so little understood". Though he would never write a cohesive body of work on Prophecy, Newton's beliefs would lead him to write several treatises on the subject, including an unpublished guide for prophetic interpretation entitled "Rules for interpreting the words & language in Scripture". In this manuscript he details the necessary requirements for what he considered to be the proper interpretation of the Bible.
The End of the World.
In his posthumously-published "Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John", Newton expressed his belief that Bible prophecy would not be understood "until the time of the end", and that even then "none of the wicked shall understand". Referring to that as a future time ("the last age, the age of opening these things, be now approaching"), Newton also anticipated "the general preaching of the Gospel be approaching" and "the Gospel must first be preached in all nations before the great tribulation, and end of the world".
Over the years, a large amount of media attention and public interest has circulated regarding largely unknown and unpublished documents, evidently written by Isaac Newton, that indicate he believed the world could end in 2060 AD. While Newton also had many other possible dates e.g. 2034), and did not believe that the End of the World would take place in 2060.
To understand the reasoning behind the 2060 prediction an understanding of Newton's theological beliefs should be taken into account, particularly his nontrinitarian beliefs and those negative views he held about the Papacy. Both of these lay essential to his calculations, which are themselves based upon specific chronological dates which he believed had already transpired and had been prophesied in Revelation and Daniel.
Despite the dramatic nature of a prediction of the end of the world, Newton may not have been referring to the 2060 date as a destructive act resulting in the annihilation of the earth and its inhabitants, but rather one in which he believed the world was to be replaced with a new one based upon a transition to an era of divinely inspired peace. In Christian theology, this concept is often referred to as The Second Coming of Jesus Christ and the establishment of Paradise by The Kingdom of God on Earth.
Other beliefs.
Henry More's belief in the universe and rejection of Cartesian dualism may have influenced Newton's religious ideas. Later works—"The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended" (1728) and "Observations Upon the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John" (1733)—were published after his death.
Newton and Boyle's mechanical philosophy was promoted by rationalist pamphleteers as a viable alternative to the pantheists and enthusiasts, and was accepted hesitantly by orthodox clergy as well as dissident preachers like the latitudinarians. The clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way in which to combat the emotional and mystical superlatives of superstitious enthusiasm, as well as the threat of atheism.
The attacks made against pre-Enlightenment magical thinking, and the mystical elements of Christianity, were given their foundation with Boyle's mechanical conception of the universe. Newton gave Boyle's ideas their completion through mathematical proofs, and more importantly was very successful in popularizing them. Newton refashioned the world governed by an interventionist God into a world crafted by a God that designs along rational and universal principles. These principles were available for all people to discover, allowed man to pursue his own aims fruitfully in this life, not the next, and to perfect himself with his own rational powers.
Writings.
His first writing on the subject of religion was "Introductio. Continens Apocalypseos rationem generalem" [ "Innovation / Introduction. Continuous Revelations - general account" -] having an unnumbered leaf between folio 1 and 2 with the subheading "De prophetia prima", written in Latin some time prior to 1670. Written subsequently in English, "Notes on early Church history and the moral superiority of the 'barbarians' to the Romans". His last writing was in 1737 entitled "A Dissertation upon the Sacred Cubit of the Jews and the Cubits of the several Nations".
Newton did not publish any of his works of Biblical study during the time he was alive. All of Newton's writings on corruption within biblical scripture and the church took place after the late 1670s and prior to the mid part of 1690.

Absolutely Sweet Marie

"Absolutely Sweet Marie" is a song written by Bob Dylan, released on his 1966 double album "Blonde on Blonde". The song is an exuberantly up-tempo number.
Song and background.
During a 1991 interview published in Paul Zollo's book "Songwriters on Songwriting, Expanded Fourth Edition" (New York: Da Capo Press, 1997), Dylan gives an idea of how he sees the song in his explanation of a line about a "yellow railroad":
Dylan did not perform "Sweet Marie" live until 1988, and has intermittently played it since, including during a session for his MTV Unplugged appearance.
"To live outside the law you must be honest".
The song contains the phrase "To live outside the law you must be honest". Jonathan Lethem points to a very similar line in the 1958 film "The Lineup": "When you live outside the law, you have to eliminate dishonesty" and that Dylan "heard it…, cleaned it up a little, and inserted it into" this song. In 1940s, in notes on his lyrics page for "Pretty Boy Floyd," Woody Guthrie wrote: "I love a good man outside the law, just as much as I hate a bad man inside the law."
Dylan, who in some ways, wore the Guthrie mantle, may have been honoring his predecessor. 
The saying "honour amongst thieves" is an old proverb that dates back many centuries.

Puplinge

Puplinge is a municipality in the canton of Geneva in Switzerland.
History.
According to Pierre Bertrand, the village of Puplinge was part of ancient Burgundy and settled in 443 by 'le peuple germanique des Burgondes' The name of the village is derived from Old German and has since been modified to fit with French spelling conventions by adding an 'e' at the end. Bertrand further states that the names of the villages of Presinge, Puplinge, Corsinge, Merlinge, etc. 'tended to indicate an area of Germanic preponderance'.
It was part of the County of Geneva originated in the 10th century, in the Kingdom of Burgundy; in the domain of Aymar of Geneva, who married Bertha of Flanders, daughter of Baudouin III, count of Flanders, and died in 1016. The territory passed to the de Thoire et Villars family on the death of Count Robert (the Avignon Pope Clement VII) in 1394, was sold in 1400 to the Counts of Savoy. During the attempts by the Duke of Savoy to capture Geneva in 1602, Puplinge was part of the Savoy territory as an appendage as part of the Bailiwick of Gaillard. It was subsequently conceded to several Savoyard princes before being joined to the Duchy of Savoy in 1659.
Puplinge is first mentioned in 1573 as "Puplinge".
Prior to 1860, it was part of the Ville-La-Grand commune of Savoy as the other half of Ville La Grand commune of France of the present times. As a result of the Treaty of Turin, signed on 16 March 1816, Savoy was annexed to France as agreed back in 1858 at Plombières-les-Bains dividing the commune between Switzerland and France and Puplinge was awarded to Switzerland along with Presinge. The duty-free zone north of a line defined by Saint-Genix-sur-Guiers, Le Châtelard, Faverges and Les Contamines-Montjoie created as result of the treaty ensured that the official French frontier was located a significant distance away from the actual frontier with Switzerland. Presinge, Puplinge and the hamlets of Cara, La Louviere, and Pesay Angle were combined to form a single municipality. In 1824, the first school building opened in the town.
In 1842, the first direct elections to the town council occurred. Due to long standing tensions between Presinge and Puplinge, on 9 November 1850 Puplinge and Presinge were split into two communes creating the present day borders of the municipality. The commune has swung between Protestantism and Catholicism based on the government in charge.
In 1924, the municipality received its coat of arms.
Champ-Dollon Prison.
Approximately from the village, across the Route de Jussy lies the Maximum Security prison of Champ-Dollon, which is officially part of the municipality. It employs about 200 people and houses 500 inmates. It was built in 1977 to house 200 inmates. There are several controversies surrounding this prison. Over 60% of the prisoners are awaiting trial which has caused significant overcrowding. In 2006, the prison faced a mutiny of the inmates over the conditions as well as police brutality. Over 80% of the prisoners are of foreign origin.

For the 2009 Conseil d'Etat election, there were a total of 1,314 registered voters of which 698 (53.1%) voted.
In 2011, all the municipalities held local elections, and in Puplinge there were 17 spots open on the municipal council. There were a total of 1,513 registered voters of which 756 (50.0%) voted. Out of the 756 votes, there were 14 blank votes, 7 null or unreadable votes and 56 votes with a name that was not on the list.
Local government.
Like all municipalities in the canton of Geneva, the political authorities of Puplinge consist of an Administrative Council (Conseil administratif) headed by a mayor as executive and a Municipal Council (Conseil municipal), composed of three and twenty-seven citizens respectively, elected for four years. The local government is responsible for providing services such as primary education, social services, public transportation, and tax collection. The primary source of income is direct taxes.
Puplinge also has the distinction of being 7th in the country for the highest number of registered Green Party of Switzerland (PES) voters with 20.2% of all voters indicating their preference for PES in 2007. 
The elections are scheduled once every 4 years. Swiss citizens and foreigners residing in the Canton of Geneva for eight years or more are eligible to vote. The current mayor is Michel Pitteloud and the Deputy Mayor is Gilles Marti.
Language.
The official language spoken in Puplinge is French. However until the mid-17th century, Franco-Provençal (called Romand in Switzerland) was a common patois in the region. Vestiges of the Franco-Provençal language only survive in street names in and around the villages of Suisse Romande today. After the ratification of the treaty by the Duchy of Savoy on 4 March 1540 making French the only official language, use of all patois declined and survived only in agricultural terms and in isolated towns. Modern-day Switzerland does not recognize Franco-Provençal ("Romand") as one of its official languages.
It is speculated that the Ligurian language was spoken in pre-Roman times in this region. Very little is known about this language which is believed to have been Indo-European in origin.

During the 2009-2010 school year there were a total of 452 students in the Puplinge school system. The education system in the Canton of Geneva allows young children to attend two years of non-obligatory Kindergarten. During that school year, there were 35 children who were in a pre-kindergarten class. The canton's school system provides two years of non-mandatory kindergarten and requires students to attend six years of primary school, with some of the children attending smaller, specialized classes.

Amidol

Amidol is a colorless crystalline compound with the molecular structure C6H3(NH2)2OH. It is a dihydrogen chloride salt and is used as a photographic developer. It was introduced as a developing agent for photographic papers in 1892. It is unusual amongst developing agents as it works most effectively in slightly acid conditions rather than the strongly alkaline conditions required for most other developers. As amidol ages it changes color to a dark red-brown. Developing dishes and equipment used to prepare amidol solutions are also frequently stained brown, a stain that is very persistent.
Prints developed in amidol are typically a very warm brown-black colour, but overdevelopment can quickly lead to chemical fogging.

Gobowen railway station

Gobowen railway station is a railway station on the Shrewsbury to Chester Line of the former Great Western Railway's London (Paddington) to Birkenhead via Birmingham (Snow Hill) line, serving the small town of Gobowen in Shropshire, England. It is the nearest station to the town of Oswestry.
Gobowen station is north west of Shrewsbury railway station.
History.
The station building was designed by Thomas Mainwaring Penson, and is a Grade II listed building. The station was built in 1846 by the Shrewsbury and Chester railway in a notable Florentine (or Italianate) style with white stucco facing and a small turret. The awnings and the footbridge were added later by the Great Western Railway (the footbridge was demolished in 1987). Although a very small village, Gobowen was the junction station for the much larger regional town of Oswestry some three miles away. When rail services to Oswestry ceased in November 1966, Gobowen was retained as the railhead for the surrounding area. There is a scheme in progress to open this branch as a heritage railway.
Until 1967 Gobowen was served by the GWR, latterly BR Western Region, express services between London Paddington and Birkenhead Woodside.
Severn-Dee Travel was established in 1995 and managed by the late David Lloyd, who was also a keen campaigner for the restoration of a direct rail link between the area and London. Following his death, the Wrexham & Shropshire locomotive 67015 was named in his honour, and a replica nameplate from the locomotive can be seen in the booking office.
Future.
Gobowen station may become in the near future the northern terminus of the proposed Cambrian Heritage Railways line to Llynclys, Pant and Blodwel via Oswestry. The coal yard at Gobowen is to be bought by Shropshire Council for railway related uses, including car parking for the station. If the plans are realised the station would have three platforms, one of which would be for the Heritage Railway.
Facilities.
The main building, which was renovated in 2005, is used as small business space. The booking office is now located in the waiting room on the southbound platform. Unusually, it is not operated directly by the train operating company but by an independent travel agent, Severn-Dee Travel.
The station has two platforms:

Association of Surfing Professionals

The Association of Surfing Professionals (ASP) is the governing body for professional surfers and is dedicated to showcasing the world’s best talent in a variety of progressive formats.
History.
Predecessors to the ASP.
The predecessors of the ASP relates to what organization predominantly represented individual professional surfers at that time. This is an important point because the International Surfing Federation (ISF) still functions to this day as the International Surfing Association (ISA) and also refers to competition winners as world champions (or variants thereof).
Creation of the ASP.
Ian Cairns watched the demise of the IPS commence throughout 1982 and saw an opportunity. In January 1983, Cairns launched the ASP and lured the world circuit organizers to the new organization, which effectively pushed aside the IPS who were left to operate only the Hawaiian pro events. By December 1984, the ASP had sanctioned the IPS controlled Pipeline Masters as a specialty event available to ASP members to enter for the first time. The ASP has remained the predominant surfing organization and sanctioning body for professional surfers since its formation.
The ASP's first world champions were Tom Carroll (men's) and Kim Mearig (women's) in 1983.
ASP Membership.
Membership to the ASP is only available to individuals.
ASP World Title Race.
The ASP World Title Race is used to determine the ASP World Title and the ASP Women’s World Title. The winner is referred to as the ASP World Tour Champion.
In 2012, the ASP World Title is given to the surfer with the most accumulated points from their respective best 8 results from the 10 ASP World Tour events (ASP Prime and Star events excluded).
In 2012, the ASP Women’s World Title is given to the surfer with the most accumulated points from their respective best 6 results from the 7 ASP Women’s World Tour events (ASP Star Events excluded).
ASP World Tour & ASP Women's World Tour.
The ASP World Tour is the men's elite competition consisting of the best 34 professional surfers competing in 10 events (as of 2012).
The ASP Women's World Tour is the women's elite competition consisting of the best 17 professional surfers competing in 7 events (as of 2012).
Event results are converted to points and count towards the ASP World Title Race and the ultimate prize of being called the ASP World Tour Champion.
ASP Prime & ASP Star events.
An ASP Prime event is held at premium venues with a restricted field and offers Prime ASP World Rankings points.
An ASP Star event is a lower level of competition, compared to an ASP Prime event, with their importance indicated by how many stars they are assigned: more stars means generally better competition and prize money.
ASP World Ranking.
ASP World Tour and ASP Women's World Tour surfers accumulate points from each ASP World Tour, ASP Prime (ASP World Tour only) and ASP Star event they compete in which count towards their ASP World Ranking. Accumulated points are valid for 12 months from the final date of the scheduled event in which they were earned.
Promotion & Relegation.
ASP World Ranking determines the promotion or relegation of surfers.
2012 Tours.
The qualifiers for the 2012 ASP World Tour top 34 surfers was determined using a Rotation Points system.
The qualifiers for the 2012 ASP Women's World Tour was determined by a surfer's rank at the conclusion of the 2011 Tour. The top 10 re-qualified for 2012 and the remaining 7 places were taken from the ASP Star Ranking.
2013 Tours.
The qualifiers for the 2013 ASP World Tour top 34 surfers will consist of:

Rules.
Judging.
In contests surfers will be scored on a scale of 0.1 to 10.0, these scores will be broken up into increments of one-tenth.
The following scale can be used in order to relate descriptions with the score:
Judging criteria.
Judges will base the previous score on how successfully surfers display these following elements in each wave:
These elements may be weighted differently from day to day and event to event, depending upon on the surfing conditions and the type of breaking wave at each event location. This criterion is different from in longboarding competitions. All of this is focused on creating some type consistency that can be seen throughout the many different events.
The events themselves are previously declared 1-6 star events; among other things this ranking shows what numbers of judges which are required at the event. A 1-3 star events are required to have a six judge panel with four judges on each heat. A 4-6 Star event requires seven judges with five of those judges on each heat. At 5-6 star events and prime events there is only allowed to be 3 judges from any one region. This is then limited to two at any world title events. All events also require an ASP approved head judge who has the ability to make corrections to errors or any other events that may have affected the results.
Rules.
There are many rules out in the water which all revolve around the idea of right of way. A surfer has right of way if he or she is closer to the area where the wave is breaking, this is more commonly referred to as having the inside position. If another surfer takes off in front of the surfer which has the inside position then interference will be called and penalties will be enacted. In most circumstances it does not matter who stood up first but who has the inside position.
A surfer can also be found guilty of inference if they catch more than their maximum amount of waves in a heat and that this takes away from the other competitors ability to catch waves. A competitor is also not allowed to interfere with another competitor’s paddling and maneuvering for a wave.
The rules of right-a-way vary slightly with the type of break. Point Breaks will always have a consistent direct of what is inside, that is the person further up the line will have right-away. In a single peak situation where there is both a left and a right two people are able to be on the wave at the same time provided that one goes left and one goes right and that neither crosses the path of the other to go one direction. If this does happen then the surfer who stood up first will get the right-a-way. On a multi peaked wave where the wave eventually comes together both peaks can be surfed until the surfers come together, when they do the surfer who stood up first has right-a-way and the other must maneuver to get off the wave without interrupting the other surfer.
In a one-on-one competition priority can be declared by the Head Judge. Once the person with priority has paddled for a wave priority is then turned over to the next person until that person does the same. The person with second priority can paddle for waves as long as it does not interfere with the other person who will lose their priority only if they catch a wave.
A surfer who has already taken off or obtained possession of a wave maintains this position until the end of their ride. If another surfer takes off on the inside of this surfer then this person does not obtain priority and is considered to be snaking. If this surfer does not hurt the other surfers ride then both people can be scored based. If the judges determine that the snaking did interfere then the person will be penalized. 
Interference penalties are called by the judges and must have a majority to be declared an actual penalty. Interference are shown as triangles on the score cards in various different ways depending on when or where in the heat they were made. If three or more waves are being scored then one wave will be dropped off the score card. If only the top two waves are being scored then 50% of the second best scored wave will be taken off. If a surfer has more than one then 50% of the best waves score will be taken off also. The surfer who has been interfered with will be allowed an additional wave to their maximum as long as it is within the time limit. If a surfer interferes more than twice in a heat then they must leave the competition area.

Plame affair grand jury investigation

The CIA leak grand jury investigation (related to the "CIA leak scandal", also known as the "Plame affair") was a federal inquiry "into the alleged unauthorized disclosure of a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee's identity", a possible violation of criminal statutes, including the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982, and Title 18, United States Code, Section 793.
CIA leak scandal ("Plame affair").
The "CIA leak scandal", or the "Plame affair", refers to a dispute stemming from allegations that one or more White House officials revealed Valerie Plame Wilson's covert CIA identity as "Valerie Plame" to reporters.
In his July 14, 2003 Washington Post column, Robert Novak revealed the name of CIA employee Valerie Plame, wife of Joseph C. Wilson IV, who had covert status. Wilson, a former U.S. Ambassador, had criticized the Bush Administration in a July 6, 2003, editorial in " The New York Times". Wilson argued that the Bush Administration misrepresented intelligence prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In his column, Novak diminished Wilson’s claims:
Wilson never worked for the CIA, but his wife, Valerie Plame, is an Agency operative on weapons of mass destruction. Two senior administration officials told me Wilson's wife suggested sending him to Niger to investigate...
On October 1, 2003, Richard Armitage told both Secretary of State Colin Powell and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that he "was the inadvertent leak".
Appointment of Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald.
On September 26, 2003, at the request of the CIA, the Department of Justice and the FBI began a criminal investigation into the possible unauthorized disclosure of classified information regarding Valerie Wilson’s CIA affiliation to various reporters in the spring of 2003. Then-Attorney General John Ashcroft initially headed up the investigation. On August 13, 2005 journalist Murray Waas reported that Justice Department and FBI officials had recommended appointing a special prosecutor to the case because they felt that Rove had not been truthful in early interviews, withholding from FBI investigators his conversation with Cooper about Plame and maintaining that he had first learned of Plame's CIA identity from a journalist whose name Rove could not recall. In addition, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft, from whose prior campaigns Rove had been paid $746,000 in consulting fees, had been briefed on the contents of at least one of Rove's interviews with the FBI, raising concerns of a conflict of interest. An October 2, 2003 "New York Times" article similarly connected Karl Rove to the matter and highlighted his prior employment in three previous political campaigns for Ashcroft. Ashcroft subsequently recused himself from the investigation, apparently at the end of December 2003.
U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois Patrick Fitzgerald was appointed Special Counsel on December 30, 2003.
Letter from James B. Comey, Acting Attorney General, to Patrick J. Fitzgerald, United States Attorney:
By the authority vested in the Attorney General by law, including 28 U.S.C. 509, 510, and 515, and in my capacity as Acting Attorney General pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 508, I hereby delegate to you all the authority of the Attorney General with respect to the Department's investigation into the alleged unauthorized disclosure of a CIA employee's identity, and I direct you to exercise that authority as Special Counsel independent of the supervision or control of any officer of the Department.
Fitzgerald began investigations into the leak working from White House telephone records turned over to the FBI in October 2003.
Fitzgerald learned of Armitage's role in the leak "shortly after his appointment in 2003". [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/07/AR2006090701781.html]
The investigation.
The first grand jury.
On October 31, 2003, a grand jury was sworn in and began taking testimony. A complete list of witnesses to testify there is not known, in part because Fitzgerald has conducted his investigation with much more discretion than previous presidential investigations.
Some individuals have acknowledged giving testimony, including White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan, Deputy Press Secretary Claire Buchan, former press secretary Ari Fleischer, former special advisor to the president Karen Hughes, former White House communications aide Adam Levine, former advisor to the Vice President Mary Matalin, and former Secretary of State Colin Powell.
Fitzgerald interviewed both Vice President Dick Cheney and President George W. Bush but not separately and not under oath.
Legal filings by Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald contain many pages blanked out for security reasons, leading some observers to speculate that Fitzgerald has pursued the extent to which national security was compromised by Plame's identity being revealed.
In March 2004, the Special Counsel subpoenaed the telephone records of Air Force One.
Journalists and contempt of court.
Several journalists have testified on this matter.
Novak.
Columnist Robert Novak, who later admitted that the CIA attempted to dissuade him from revealing Plame's name in print, "appears to have made some kind of arrangement with the special prosecutor" (according to "Newsweek") and he was not charged with contempt of court.
Cooper.
On July 2, 2005, Karl Rove's lawyer, Robert Luskin, said that his client spoke to "TIME" reporter Matt Cooper "three or four days" before Plame's identity was first revealed in print by commentator Robert Novak. (Cooper's article in "TIME", citing unnamed and anonymous "government officials", confirmed Plame to be a "CIA official who monitors the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction". Cooper's article appeared three days after Novak's column was published.) Rove's lawyer, however, asserted that Rove "never knowingly disclosed classified information" and that "he did not tell any reporter that Valerie Plame worked for the CIA". This second statement has since been called into question by an e-mail, written three days before Novak's column, in which Cooper indicated that Rove had told him Wilson's wife worked at the CIA. If Rove were aware that this was classified information at the time, then both disclaimers by his lawyer would be untrue. Furthermore, Luskin said that Rove himself had testified before the grand jury "two or three times" (three times, according to the "Los Angeles Times" of July 3, 2005) and signed a waiver authorizing reporters to testify about their conversations with him and that Rove "has answered every question that has been put to him about his conversations with Cooper and anybody else." Rove's lawyer declined to share with "Newsweek" reporter Michael Isikoff the nature or contents of his client's conversations with Cooper.
On July 6, 2005, Cooper agreed to testify, thus avoiding being held in contempt of court and sent to jail. Cooper said "I went to bed ready to accept the sanctions for not testifying", but told the judge that not long before his early afternoon appearance at court he had received "in somewhat dramatic fashion" an indication from his source freeing him from his commitment to keep his source's identity secret. For some observers this called into question the allegations against Rove, who had signed a waiver months before permitting reporters to testify about their conversations with him (see above paragraph).
Cooper, however, stated in court that he did not previously accept a general waiver to journalists signed by his source (whom he did not identify by name), because he had made a personal pledge of confidentiality to his source. The 'dramatic change' which allowed Cooper to testify was later revealed to be a phone conversation between lawyers for Cooper and his source confirming that the waiver signed two years earlier applied to conversations with Cooper. Citing a "person who has been officially briefed on the case", "The New York Times" identified Rove as the individual in question, a fact later confirmed by Rove's own lawyer. According to one of Cooper's lawyers, Cooper has previously testified before the grand jury regarding conversations with Lewis "Scooter" Libby, Jr., chief of staff for Vice President Dick Cheney, after having received Libby's specific permission to testify.
Cooper testified before a grand jury on July 13, 2005, confirming that Rove was the source who told him Wilson's wife was an employee of the CIA. In the July 17, 2005 "TIME Magazine" article detailing his grand jury testimony, Cooper wrote that Rove never used Plame's name nor indicated that she had covert status, although Rove did apparently convey that certain information relating to her was classified: "As for Wilson's wife, I told the grand jury I was certain that Rove never used her name and that, indeed, I did not learn her name until the following week, when I either saw it in Robert Novak's column or Googled her, I can't recall which...was it through my conversation with Rove that I learned for the first time that Wilson's wife worked at the C.I.A. and may have been responsible for sending him? Yes. Did Rove say that she worked at the 'agency' on 'W.M.D.'? Yes. When he said things would be declassified soon, was that itself impermissible? I don't know. Is any of this a crime? Beats me." Cooper also explained to the grand jury that the "double super secret background" under which Rove spoke to him was not an official White House or "TIME Magazine" source or security designation, but an allusion to the 1978 film "Animal House", in which a college fraternity is placed under "double secret probation".
Miller.
"New York Times" investigative reporter Judith Miller, who met with Lewis Libby on July 8, 2003, two days after Wilson's editorial was published, never wrote or reported a story on the Plame affair, but nevertheless refused (with Cooper) to answer questions before a grand jury in 2004 pertaining to confidential sources. Both reporters were held in contempt of court. On June 27, 2005, after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to grant certiorari, "TIME Magazine" said it would surrender to Fitzgerald e-mail records and notes taken by Cooper, and Cooper agreed to testify before the grand jury after receiving a waiver from his source. Miller and Cooper faced potential jail terms for failure to cooperate with the Special Counsel's investigations.
"New York Times" reporter Judith Miller served a civil contempt jail sentence from early July 2005 to September 29, 2005, for refusing to testify to the grand jury.
Miller was jailed on July 7, 2005 in Alexandria, Virginia. She was released on September 29, upon reaching an agreement with Fitzgerald to testify at a hearing scheduled on the morning of September 30, 2005. Miller indicated that her source, unlike Cooper's, had not sufficiently waived confidentiality. She issued a statement at a press conference after her release, stating that her source, Lewis Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's Chief of Staff, had released her from her promise of confidentiality, saying her source "voluntarily and personally released from [her promise of confidentiality".
In August 2005 the "American Prospect" magazine reported that Lewis Libby testified he had discussed Plame with Miller during a July 8, 2003, meeting. Libby signed a general waiver allowing journalists to reveal their discussions with him on this matter, but "American Prospect" reported that Miller refused to honor this waiver on the grounds that she considered it coerced. Miller had said she would accept a specific individual waiver to testify, but contends Libby had not given her one until late September 2005. In contrast, Libby's lawyer has insisted that he had fully released Miller to testify all along.
On October 16, 2005, Judith Miller published an account of her grand jury testimony for the New York Times. In the article, titled ""My Four Hours Testifying in the Federal Grand Jury Room"", Miller writes:
My notes indicate that well before Mr. Wilson published his critique, Mr. Libby told me that Mr. Wilson's wife may have worked on unconventional weapons at the C.I.A. My notes do not show that Mr. Libby identified Mr. Wilson's wife by name. Nor do they show that he described Valerie Wilson as a covert agent or "operative", as the conservative columnist Robert D. Novak first described her in a syndicated column published on July 14, 2003. (Mr. Novak used her maiden name, Valerie Plame.)... My interview notes show that Mr. Libby sought from the beginning, before Mr. Wilson's name became public, to insulate his boss from Mr. Wilson's charges. According to my notes, he told me at our June meeting that Mr. Cheney did not know of Mr. Wilson, much less know that Mr. Wilson had traveled to Niger, in West Africa, to verify reports that Iraq was seeking to acquire uranium for a weapons program... Although I was interested primarily in my area of expertise — chemical and biological weapons — my notes show that Mr. Libby consistently steered our conversation back to the administration's nuclear claims. His main theme echoed that of other senior officials: that contrary to Mr. Wilson's criticism, the administration had had ample reason to be concerned about Iraq's nuclear capabilities based on the regime's history of weapons development, its use of unconventional weapons and fresh intelligence reports. At that breakfast meeting, our conversation also turned to Mr. Wilson's wife. My notes contain a phrase inside parentheses: "Wife works at Winpac." Mr. Fitzgerald asked what that meant. Winpac stood for Weapons Intelligence, Non-Proliferation, and Arms Control, the name of a unit within the C.I.A. that, among other things, analyzes the spread of unconventional weapons. I said I couldn't be certain whether I had known Ms. Plame's identity before this meeting, and I had no clear memory of the context of our conversation that resulted in this notation. But I told the grand jury that I believed that this was the first time I had heard that Mr. Wilson's wife worked for Winpac. In fact, I told the grand jury that when Mr. Libby indicated that Ms. Plame worked for Winpac, I assumed that she worked as an analyst, not as an undercover operative... Mr. Fitzgerald asked me about another entry in my notebook, where I had written the words "Valerie Flame", clearly a reference to Ms. Plame. Mr. Fitzgerald wanted to know whether the entry was based on my conversations with Mr. Libby. I said I didn't think so. I said I believed the information came from another source, whom I could not recall.
The investigation expands to perjury and obstruction.
On May 13, 2005, citing "close followers of the case", "The Washington Post" reported that the length of the investigation, and the particular importance paid to the testimony of reporters, suggested that the counsel's role had expanded to include investigation of perjury charges against witnesses. Other observers have suggested that the testimony of journalists was needed to show a pattern of intent by the leaker or leakers.
On October 6, 2005, Fitzgerald recalled Karl Rove, for the fourth time, to take the stand before the grand jury investigating the leak of Plame's identity. Fitzgerald had indicated that the only remaining witnesses to call were Cooper and Miller before he would close his case.
Indictment of Libby.
On October 28, 2005, the grand jury issued a five-count indictment against Lewis Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's Chief of Staff, on felony charges of perjury, obstruction of justice, and making false statements to the FBI and the grand jury investigating the matter.
Libby was charged with lying to FBI agents and to the grand jury about two conversations with reporters, Tim Russert of NBC News and Matt Cooper of "Time" magazine. According to the Indictment, the obstruction of justice count alleges that while testifying under oath before the grand jury on March 5, and March 24, 2004, Libby knowingly and corruptly endeavored to influence, obstruct and impede the grand jury’s investigation by misleading and deceiving the grand jury as to when, and the manner and means by which, he acquired, and subsequently disclosed to the media, information concerning the employment of Valerie Wilson by the CIA.
From January 20, 2001, to October 28, 2005, Libby served as Assistant to the President, Chief of Staff to the Vice President, and Assistant to the Vice President for National Security Affairs. After the indictment was released to the public, Libby resigned his position in the White House.
On November 3, 2005, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby entered a not guilty plea in front of U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton, a former prosecutor who has spent two decades as a judge in the nation's capital.
United States v. Libby.
The second grand jury.
The first grand jury's term expired on October 28, the day it indicted Libby. On November 18, 2005, Fitzgerald submitted new court papers indicating that he would use a new grand jury to assist him in his ongoing investigation. The use of a new grand jury could indicate that additional evidence or charges are coming, but experienced federal prosecutors cautioned against reading too much into Fitzgerald's disclosure:
"It could just mean that the prosecutor needs the powers of the grand jury" to further his investigation and make a final determination whether to charge, said Dan French, a former federal prosecutor now representing a witness in the inquiry.
"One of the greatest powers of the grand jury is the ability to subpoena witnesses … and Fitzgerald may want that authority to pursue additional questions", French said. He might also need subpoenas to obtain documents, telephone records and executive branch agency security logs.
After a six week break, special prosecutor Patrick J. Fitzgerald presented information to a new grand jury on December 8, 2005.
Court proceedings.
Due to the huge amount of classified material that had been requested by Libby's defense, David Corn speculated that Libby was using Graymail as defense tactic. Libby had added the graymail expert John D. Cline to his defense team.
In December 2005, Patrick Fitzgerald responded to a motion by Dow Jones & Company, Inc., to unseal all or part of the redacted portion of a United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia opinion issued on February 15, 2005. The opinion pertained to oral arguments held on December 8, 2004. The opinion of the court was released on February 3, 2006, to the public. It states:
As to the leaks’ harmfulness, although the record omits specifics about Plame’s work, it appears to confirm, as alleged in the public record and reported in the press, that she worked for the CIA in some unusual capacity relating to counterproliferation. Addressing deficiencies of proof regarding the Intelligence Identities Protection Act, the special counsel refers to Plame as “a person whose identity the CIA was making specific efforts to conceal and who had carried out covert work overseas within the last 5 years” — representations I trust the special counsel would not make without support. (8/27/04 Aff. at 28 n.15.)
On January 31, 2006, letters exchanged between Libby's lawyers and Fitzgerald's office concerning matters of discovery were released to the public. Reportedly, Fitzgerald states:
"A formal assessment has not been done of the damage caused by the disclosure of Valerie Wilson’s status as a CIA employee, and thus we possess no such document. In any event, we would not view an assessment of the damage caused by the disclosure as relevant to the issue of whether or not Mr. Libby intentionally lied when he made the statements and gave the grand jury testimony which the grand jury alleged was false."
On March 17, 2006, Patrick Fitzgerald filed the government's response to a motion by Scooter Libby's defense team to dismiss the indictments.
On April 5, 2006, Patrick Fitzgerald filed the government's response to a motion by Scooter Libby's defense team on issues of discovery. On April 12, 2006, Fitzgerald issued a correction to some of the information in the government's motion. In the memo, he writes:
Nor would such documents of the CIA, NSC and the State Department place in context the importance of the conversations in which defendant participated. Defendant’s participation in a critical conversation with Judith Miller on July 8 (discussed further below) occurred only after the Vice President advised defendant that the President specifically had authorized defendant to disclose certain information in the NIE. Defendant testified that the circumstances of his conversation with reporter Miller — getting approval from the President through the Vice President to discuss material that would be classified but for that approval — were unique in his recollection. Defendant further testified that on July 12, 2003, he was specifically directed by the Vice President to speak to the press in place of Cathie Martin (then the communications person for the Vice President) regarding the NIE and Wilson. Defendant was instructed to provide what was for him an extremely rare “on the record” statement, and to provide “background” and “deep background” statements, and to provide information contained in a document defendant understood to be the cable authored by Mr. Wilson. During the conversations that followed on July 12, defendant discussed Ms. Wilson’s employment with both Matthew Cooper (for the first time) and Judith Miller (for the third time). Even if someone else in some other agency thought that the controversy about Mr. Wilson and/or his wife was a trifle, that person’s state of mind would be irrelevant to the importance and focus defendant placed on the matter and the importance he attached to the surrounding conversations he was directed to engage in by the Vice President.
Karl Rove testified before the new grand jury for the fifth time in the case on April 26, 2006, and, on June 12, 2006, his attorney stated that Rove had been formally notified by Fitzgerald that Rove would not be charged with any crimes.
According to Mike Allen, in "Time Magazine", Rove's attorney Robert D. Luskin told reporters that he received a fax from Fitzgerald indicating that "absent any unexpected developments, he does not anticipate seeking any criminal charges against Rove". John Solomon of Associated Press reported that the news came by telephone rather than fax. The "New York Times" reported that the news was announced by Fitzgerald "in a letter to Mr. Luskin". Luskin's own public statement indicated only that he was "formally advised" of this news by Fitzgerald, and Luskin's office has so far refused to comment further on that statement.
In a court filing on May 12, 2006, Fitzgerald included a copy of Wilson's op-ed article in the "New York Times" "bearing handwritten notations by the vice president" (See photograph).
Fitzgerald's filing declares that Libby ascertained Plame's name from Cheney through conferences by the vice president's office about "how to respond to a June 2003 inquiry from Washington Post reporter Walter Pincus about Wilson's trip to Niger". In the filing, Fitzgerald states:
The June 12, 2003, Washington Post article by Mr. Pincus (to whom both Mr. Wilson and the defendant spoke prior to publication of the article) is relevant because Mr. Pincus’ questions to the OVP sparked discussion within the OVP, including conversations between the defendant and the Vice President regarding how Mr. Pincus’ questions should be answered. It was during a conversation concerning Mr. Pincus’ inquiries that the Vice President advised the defendant that Mr. Wilson’s wife worked at the CIA. (To be clear, the government does not contend that the defendant disclosed the employment of Ms. Plame to Mr. Pincus, and Mr. Pincus’s article contains no reference to her or her employment.) The article by Mr. Pincus thus explains the context in which the defendant discussed Mr. Wilson’s wife’s employment with the Vice President. The article also served to increase media attention concerning the then-unnamed ambassador’s trip and further motivated the defendant to counter Mr. Wilson’s assertions, making it more likely that the defendant’s disclosures to the press concerning Mr. Wilson’s wife were not casual disclosures that he had forgotten by the time he was asked about them by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and before the grand jury.
Fitzgerald sought to compel Matt Cooper, a "Time Magazine" correspondent who had covered the story, to disclose his sources to a grand jury. After losing all legal appeals up through the Supreme Court, "Time" turned over Cooper's notes to the prosecutor. Cooper agreed to testify after receiving permission from his source, Karl Rove, to do so. Robert Luskin confirmed Rove was Cooper's source. A July 11, 2003, e-mail from Cooper to his bureau chief indicated that Rove had told Cooper that it was Wilson's wife who authorized her husband's trip to Niger, mentioning that she "apparently" worked at "the agency" on weapons of mass destruction issues. "Newsweek" reported that nothing in the Cooper e-mail suggested that Rove used Plame's name or knew she was a covert operative, although Cooper's "Time" magazine article describing his grand jury testimony noted that Rove said, "I've already said too much". Neither "Newsweek" nor "Time" released the complete Cooper e-mail.
On May 16, 2006, a transcript of court proceedings before Judge Reggie B. Walton was released. Libby's lawyers sought communications between Matthew Cooper and Massimo Calabresi, authors of an article published by Time magazine on July 17, 2003, and titled, "A War on Wilson?" Libby's lawyers contend that Massimo called Joe Wilson after Cooper learned from Karl Rove that Wilson's wife worked at the CIA. Libby's lawyers also told the judge they have an e-mail Cooper sent to his editor describing a July 12, 2003, conversation with Libby in which there is no mention of Plame or her CIA status. An e-mail was sent to Cooper's editor on July 16, 2003, "four days after his conversation with Mr. Libby and 5 days after his conversation with Mr. Rove, about the article they are planning to write in which they are going to mention the wife. And the e-mail says — talks about him having an administration source for the information about Ms. Wilson". Thus, Libby's lawyers sought communications between Massimo and Cooper to determine if Cooper conveyed to Massimo that Libby was a source as well for the information on Wilson's wife:
And I submit to Your Honor there is — as you can see, the credibility of Mr. Cooper with respect to his description that Mr. Libby confirmed MPlame's employment by the C.I.A. is going to be very much at issue in this case. And that is what cases are all about, and we should be entitled to anything that Mr. Cooper has said ro that others have said or done, such as Mr. Massimo talking to Mr. Wilson on the basis of what Cooper said. And that kind of information is directly relevant to the cross-examination, and we submit that it should be enforced. And certainly we have established specificity with respec to that. The other thing I would say is this is the first I have heard that Time has a document that refers to Ms. Plame. Now, perhaps, that's Mr. Copper's communication with Mr. Massimo, or perhaps it is Mr. Massimo's notes with Mr. Wilson. I don't know, but certainly if there is a document that does refer to Ms. Plame prior to July 14, we submit that that's relevant and should be produced as well. That's all I have on Time and Cooper, Your Honor.
On May 26, 2006, Judge Walton ruled on the motion:
However, upon reviewing the documents presented to it, the Court discerns a slight alteration between the several drafts of the articles, which the defense could arguably use to impeach Cooper. This slight alteration between the drafts will permit the defendant to impeach Cooper, regardless of the substance of his trial testimony, because his trial testimony cannot be consistent with both versions. Thus, unlike Miller, whose documents appear internally consistent and thus will only be admissible if she testifies inconsistently with these documents, Cooper’s documents will undoubtedly be admissible. Because of the inevitability that Cooper will be a government witness at trial, this Court can fathom no reason to delay the production of these documents to the defendant, as they will undoubtedly be admissible for impeachment.
For the reasons discussed above, this Court will grant reporter Judith Miller’s motion to quash, and grant in part and deny in part the remaining motions. Therefore, at the appropriate times as designated in this opinion, those documents subject to production must be produced to the defendant so that they can be used as impeachment or contradiction evidence during the trial. In addition, based on the facts of this case, this Court declines to recognize a First Amendment reporters’ privilege. And, the Court concludes that any common law reporters’ privilege that may exist has been overcome by the defendant.
Richard Armitage is confirmed to be primary source of leak.
On August 29, 2006, Neil A. Lewis reported in "The New York Times" that Richard Armitage has been confirmed to be the first and primary source of the CIA leak investigation.
On August 30, 2006, CNN reported that Armitage had been confirmed "by sources" as leaking Valerie Plame's role as a CIA operative in a "casual conversation" with Robert Novak.
On September 6, 2006, "The New York Times" noted that in 2003, early in his investigation, Fitzgerald knew Armitage was the primary source of the leak. The "Times" raised questions as to why the investigation proceeded as long as it did. New York Times
According to lawyers close to Libby, "the information about Mr. Armitage’s role may help Mr. Libby convince a jury that his actions were relatively inconsequential".
Fitzgerald never issued a statement about Armitage's involvement.
The trial.
The trial began on January 16, 2007.
Libby, who was questioned by the FBI in the fall of 2003 and testified before a Federal grand jury on March 5, 2004, and again on March 24, 2004, has pleaded not guilty to all charges. David Addington, Cheney's legal counsel during the CIA leak scandal, testified in January 2007 that Libby bluntly told him, "I just want to tell you, I didn't do it".
Libby retains attorney Ted Wells of the firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison to represent him in the case. Wells is known for successfully defending Clinton Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy against a 30-count indictment and participating in the successful defense of former Secretary of Labor Raymond Donovan.
On January 23, 2007, the Associated Press reported that Wells alleged "that administration officials sought to blame Libby for the leak to protect Bush political adviser Karl Rove's own disclosures".
After Libby's motion to dismiss was denied, the press initially reported that he would testify at the trial. In February 2007, during the trial, however, numerous press reports stressed that whether or not he will testify was still uncertain, and, ultimately, he did not testify at trial.
The jury received the case for their deliberation on February 21, 2007.
Verdict.
After deliberating for ten days, the jury rendered its verdict at noon on March 6, 2007. It convicted Libby on four of the five counts against him — two counts of perjury, one count of obstructing justice in a grand jury investigation, and one of the two counts of making false statements to federal investigators — and acquitted him on one count of making false statements. Given current federal sentencing guidelines, which are not mandatory, the convictions could result in a sentence ranging from no imprisonment to imprisonment of up to 25 years and a fine of one million US dollars. Given those non-binding guidelines, according to lawyer, author, "New Yorker" staff writer, and CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin on "Anderson Cooper 360°", such a sentence could likely be between "one and a half to three years". Sentencing was scheduled for June 2007. His lawyers have announced their intention to seek a new trial and, if that attempt fails, to appeal Libby's conviction.
Comment on the verdict by juror.
As reported in "CNN Newsroom", and subsequently on "Larry King Live" on CNN and by various other television networks, including MSNBC (on "Scarborough Country"), one juror — "Denis Collins, a Washington resident and self-described registered Democrat", who is a journalist and former reporter at "The Washington Post" and the author of a book on espionage and a novel — "said he and fellow jurors found that passing judgment on Libby was 'unpleasant.' But in the final analysis, he said jurors found Libby's story just too hard to believe... 'We're not saying we didn't think Mr. Libby was guilty of the things we found him guilty of, but it seemed like ... he was the fall guy'... Collins said the jury believed Libby was 'tasked by the vice president to go and talk to reporters.'" Collins offers a day-by-day account of his experience as Juror #9 at the Libby trial in an "Exclusive" at "The Huffington Post".
Press coverage of the trial.
Blogs have played a prominent role in the press coverage of this trial. Scott Shane, in his article "For Liberal Bloggers, Libby Trial Is Fun and Fodder", published in "The New York Times" on February 15, 2007, quotes Robert Cox, president of the Media Bloggers Association, who observes that United States of America v. I. Lewis Libby is "the first federal case for which independent bloggers have been given official credentials along with reporters from the traditional news media".
Karl Rove.
On June 13, 2006, Robert Luskin released the following statement:
"On June 12, 2006, Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald formally advised us that he does not anticipate seeking charges against Karl Rove.In deference to the pending case, we will not make any further public statements about the subject matter of the investigation. We believe that the Special Counsel's decision should put an end to the baseless speculation about Mr. Rove’s conduct."
On June 14, 2006, Joe Wilson responded to Luskin's statement by stating that "this is a marathon... it's not over." He referred other questions to a statement released by his lawyer, Christopher Wolf. In the statement, Wolf stated that "while it appears that Mr. Rove will not be called to answer in criminal court for his participation in the wrongful disclosure of Valerie Wilson's classified employment status at the CIA, that obviously does not end the matter. The day still may come when Mr. Rove and others are called to account in a court of law for their attacks on the Wilsons."
Following the revelations in the Libby indictment, sixteen former CIA and military intelligence officials urged President Bush to suspend Karl Rove's security clearance for his part in outing CIA officer Valerie Plame.
Media request CIA to unseal records.
On December 22, 2006, the Associated Press reported that AP and Dow Jones, parent company of the "Wall Street Journal", have requested a federal court to force the CIA to release testimony records. The AP and Dow Jones allege that special prosecutor Fitzgerald never needed to subpoena the media's records, including those of the "New York Times" and "Washington Post", because he knew the source of the leak all along.
Criticism.
Because the Justice Department is a part of the executive branch, some critics of the Bush Administration contend that the absence of rapid and effective action has been deliberate.
General Paul E. Vallely has criticized Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald on FOX News for not contacting a number of people who publicly stated they knew of Plame's job at the CIA.
"Many of us as private citizens really challenged the depth and the extensiveness of Special Prosecutor Fitzgerald because he never called in Joe Wilson or Valerie Plame, who was an analyst by the way, and that's documented, or any of the hierarchy of the CIA. And so to me that's an incomplete process and should probably be null and void."
General Vallely has been criticized by some for allegedly lying about his part in the affair. Vallely has claimed that Joe Wilson informed him that his wife was a covert agent, but did not reveal this until more than two years after the fact, and a year and a half after the investigation had begun.
An editorial in the "Washington Post" reads:
The special counsel was principally investigating whether any official violated a law that makes it a crime to knowingly disclose the identity of an undercover agent. The public record offers no indication that Mr. Libby or any other official deliberately exposed Ms. Plame to punish her husband, former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV. Rather, Mr. Libby and other officials, including Karl Rove, the White House deputy chief of staff, apparently were seeking to combat the sensational allegations of a critic. They may have believed that Ms. Plame's involvement was an important part of their story of why Mr. Wilson was sent to investigate claims that Iraq sought uranium ore from Niger, and why his subsequent — and mostly erroneous — allegations that the administration twisted that small part of the case against Saddam Hussein should not be credited. To criminalize such discussions between officials and reporters would run counter to the public interest... That said, the charges Mr. Fitzgerald brought against Mr. Libby are not technicalities. According to the indictment, Mr. Libby lied to both the FBI and a grand jury. No responsible prosecutor would overlook a pattern of deceit like that alleged by Mr. Fitzgerald. The prosecutor was asked to investigate a serious question, and such obstructions are, as he said yesterday, like throwing sand in the umpire's face. In this case, they seem to have contributed to Mr. Fitzgerald's distressing decision to force a number of journalists to testify about conversations with a confidential source. Both Mr. Libby and Mr. Rove appear to have allowed the White House spokesman to put out false information about their involvement.
John W. Dean, the former counsel to Richard Nixon, writes in an open letter to Patrick Fitzgerald:
In your post as Special Counsel, you now have nothing less than authority of the Attorney General of the United States, for purposes of the investigation and prosecution of "the alleged unauthorized disclosure of a CIA employee's identity." (The employee, of course, is Valerie Plame Wilson, a CIA employee with classified status, and the wife of former Ambassador Joseph Wilson.) On December 30, 2003, you received a letter from the Deputy Attorney General regarding your powers. On February 6, 2004, you received a letter of further clarification, stating without reservation, that in this matter your powers are "plenary." In effect, then, you act with the power of the Attorney General of the United States.
In light of your broad powers, the limits and narrow focus of your investigation are surprising. On October 28 of this year, your office released a press statement in which you stated that "A major focus of the grand jury investigation was to determine which government officials had disclosed to the media prior to July 14, 2003, information concerning Valerie Wilson's CIA affiliation, and the nature, timing, extent, and purpose of such disclosures, as well as whether any official made such a disclosure knowing that Valerie Wilson's employment by the CIA was classified information."
Troubling, from an historical point of view, is the fact that the narrowness of your investigation, which apparently is focusing on the Intelligence Identities Protection Act (making it a crime to uncover the covert status of a CIA agent), plays right into the hands of perpetrators in the Administration.
Indeed, this is exactly the plan that was employed during Watergate by those who sought to conceal the Nixon Administration's crimes, and keep criminals in office.
The plan was to keep the investigation focused on the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters — and away from the atmosphere in which such an action was undertaken. Toward this end, I was directed by superiors to get the Department of Justice to keep its focus on the break-in, and nothing else.
That was done. And had Congress not undertaken its own investigation (since it was a Democratically-controlled Congress with a Republican President) it is very likely that Watergate would have ended with the conviction of those caught in the bungled burglary and wiretapping attempt at the Democratic headquarters.

Courtyard Crisis

The Courtyard Crisis () was a significant event in Swedish 20th-century history, marking the last time the Monarch of Sweden directly intervened in a controversial partisan political issue, as was done by the King Gustaf V through the Courtyard Speech at the Royal Palace in Stockholm () on 6 February 1914, in front of 32 000 assembled farmers from all over the country, and where he argued for higher military spending.
Background and aftermath.
In early 1914, tensions ran high in Sweden over the issue of defence spending, with the Great War looming over Europe. On 6 February 1914, Conservative opponents of the Liberal government of Prime Minister Karl Staaff summoned a 32 000-person demonstration of farmers demanding higher defence spending. Gustaf V, who was in continual conflict with his government, declared to the crowd gathered in the courtyard of Stockholm Palace that he shared their concerns.
When Prime Minister Staaff reminded the King that a parliamentary system meant the latter's exclusion from partisan politics, the King refused and said he would ""not give up the right to communicate freely with the Swedish people"". The government promptly resigned, and 136 Liberal members from both chambers of the Riksdag issued a statement saying the form of government was in jeopardy, and urging the Swedish people to defend its right to rule itself. Their opponents, the Conservatives and the Farmers' League, in turn accused them of putting parliamentarism over national security, and called on the people to put every effort into solving the defence issue.
The King appointed a conservative government of high-ranking civil servants and businessmen led by Hjalmar Hammarskjöld, but tensions continued in the debate on spending. The second chamber of the Riksdag was dissolved and new elections called for. 
The conflict abruptly ended that June with the imminent breakout of war in Europe, which in effect decided the argument in favour of the Conservatives; however, some reforms and budget amendments were implemented to appease the Liberals. In the end, only the Social Democrats voted against the defence programme, although 24 Liberal parliamentarians discarded their votes in protest.

R. v. Collins

R. v. Collins 1 S.C.R. 265 is a leading decision of the Supreme Court of Canada on section 8 and was a leading case on section 24(2) of the Constitution Act, 1982 which allowed for the exclusion of evidence upon infringing the Charter. The "Collins test" for section 24(2) was developed for determining if the administration of justice was brought into disrepute by the inclusion of the evidence. The test was later replaced in "R. v. Grant".
Background.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police Drug Squad in Vancouver had Ruby Collins under surveillance as part of an investigation into a "heroin problem". One of the officers approached her in a local pub, told her that he was a police officer, and then grabbed her by the throat and in the process dragged her down to the floor in what is known as a "throat hold" used to prevent suspects from swallowing drug filled balloons. The officer then told her to let go of a heroin filled balloon she had in her hand, and she did so. The officer then arrested Collins for drug possession.
At the voir dire, Crown counsel sought to justify the search under what was then section 10 of the Narcotics Control Act (NCA). The search power in s. 10 required the officer to "reasonably believe" there is an illegal narcotic in a place. In order to establish the officer's reasonable belief, Crown counsel asked the officer when he began to suspect that Ruby Collins was in possession of heroin. The officer began to respond: "We were advised..." but defence counsel objected with an interruption, arguing that whatever the officer had been told by a third party was hearsay. (In fact, as Lamer J. notes, the fact was not hearsay and the trial judge should have been overruled.) In this way, the grounds for the officer's belief that Ruby Collins possessed heroin was never established at trial, and the trial judge concluded that, since the requirements of s. 10 were not met, the search was illegal.
Reasons of the court.
The majority judgment was given by Lamer J.
Section 8.
Lamer began by examining if the search violated Collins rights under section 8 that protects individuals against unreasonable search and seizure. A search can only be reasonable, Lamer held, if it met three requirements:
In this way, the Supreme Court disagreed with some lower courts, and some American jurisprudence, in holding that an illegal search was "automatically" unreasonable.
Lamer J. concluded that, since the Crown had not established that the search had met the requirements of section 10 of the Narcotics Control Act, it was not authorized by law. Therefore, it failed the first prong of the three-part test and was an unreasonable search under s. 8 of the Charter.
Section 24(2).
Once a violation was found, the case turned on the meaning of section 24(2) which said that once a violation of an individuals charter rights have been found, the evidence obtained through the violation must be excluded if its inclusion would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
Lamer examined the meaning of "disrepute". He rejected the previous use of the term established in Rothman v. The Queen 1 S.C.R. 640 which suggested evidence should be excluded on grounds that it would "shock" the community. Instead, he stated, the standard should be lower. He does not give a clear definition of "disrepute" but instead gives a set of three weighted factors to determine if there has been disrepute. The factors consist of:
The method of analyzing the first set of factors was presented in "R. v. Stillman" which produced the ""Stillman" test". This analysis includes looking at the nature of the evidence and whether there would have been any alternative means of obtaining the evidence.
The second point of analysis examines whether admission of the evidence would implicitly condone the illegal practices of the police. The courts focus on the manner in which the evidence was obtained. This includes factors such as whether it was done in good faith. Namely, was it inadvertent, merely technical, or whether it was deliberate or wilful. As well, the courts can consider whether there was any exigent circumstances, urgency, or necessity in the act.
The third set of factors look at the effect of the exclusion on the repute of the administration of justice. The effect of the admission must be weighed against its exclusion. The courts compare the seriousness of the breach and the fairness of the trial against the importance of the evidence in the Crown's case and the overall.
Subsequent Decisions.
In 2009, the Supreme Court of Canada found that courts were having trouble applying the "Collins" test in s. 24(2) analysis, and replaced it with a completely new test in "R. v. Grant".

Battle of Big Sandy Creek

The Battle of Big Sandy Creek was fought in northwestern New York on May 29–30, 1814, during the War of 1812. The battle was an American victory in which American militia and Oneida Indians launched a surprise attack on British soldiers who were chasing them inland from Lake Ontario.
Background.
After the successful attack on Fort Oswego on May 5–6, 1814, the British withdrew to the Galloo Islands in northern Lake Ontario where they could monitor and intercept any supplies on their way north to Sackets Harbor, New York.
At the American ship yards in Sackets Harbor, two brigs, the USS "Jefferson" and the "Jones", and a frigate, the "Superior", waited for armament and rigging necessary for their launch. The supplies needed to outfit the ships had been transported from the Brooklyn Naval Yards in New York City to Albany, New York, and from Albany up the Mohawk River to Wood Creek and Oneida Lake, finally arriving at the Oswego River. These supplies still needed to be transported from Oswego to Sackett’s Harbor, but it needed to be done without alerting the British.
On April 21, 1814, Commodore Isaac Chauncey sent orders from Sackets Harbor to Lieutenant Melancthon Taylor Woolsey directing him to choose five officers and twenty-five men to proceed in the USS "Lady of the Lake" to Oswego and then bring the shipbuilding supplies north to the shipyards.
Battle.
On the rainy evening of May 28, Woolsey set out with 150 riflemen under the command of Major Daniel Appling in 19 boats loaded with supplies. On the morning of May 29, they arrived at the mouth of the Big Salmon River having mysteriously lost one of their boats. This boat, discovered by the British forces, eliminated the secrecy of Wooley’s mission.
At Big Salmon, the American forces met up with the Oneidas (estimates range from 120 to 130 Indians), who Woolsey had dispatched the previous day. The Oneidas marched north along the shore as the boats proceeded in the lake. At noon on May 29, they reached the mouth of the Big Sandy Creek. All the boats were sent as far inland as possible.
Woolsey then sent a lookout to scout for British ships. The lookout discovered that a gunboat and three barges were headed for the location of the American forces. Woolsey set out a call for the neighboring militia and hastily prepared for battle.
At 8 a.m., the British began to cannonade the American forces from the mouth of the Big Sandy Creek. The American forces hid along the shoreline of the creek and waited for the British to advance inland. At about 10 a.m., when the British forces had progressed up the creek, the American forces rose from their concealment, and a brief ten-minute battle ensued. The British officers quickly surrendered to avoid further casualties.
Losses.
The Americans suffered 2 wounded: an Oneida Indian and a U.S. rifleman. 
Appling wrote to Brigadier General Edmund P. Gaines on May 30, listing the British casualties as 13 killed; 2 lieutenants of the Royal Marines and 28 sailors and marines wounded and captured; 7 officers and 133 others taken prisoner. Also captured were three gun-boats (one with a 24-pounder and a 63-pounder), two cutters and one gig.

Harry Connick, Sr.

Joseph Harry Fowler Connick, Sr. (born March 27, 1926) is a New Orleans attorney who is best known for serving as the district attorney of the Parish of Orleans, which contains the City of New Orleans, from 1973 to 2003. His son, Harry Connick, Jr. is a successful singer, pianist, actor, and humanitarian. The elder Connick is a singer, long performing a few nights a week at local clubs as a hobby. He has been outspoken on the use of narcotics and pressed for drug testing of high-school students.
Early life.
Connick, Sr. was born Joseph Harry Fowler Connick in Mobile, Alabama, the second of eight children of Jessie Catherine (née Fowler) and James Paul Connick. After high school, he served in the U.S. Navy in the Pacific during World War II. After the war, he returned to New Orleans and graduated from Loyola University New Orleans with a degree in business administration.
He later joined the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a civilian employee where he met his future wife, Anita Livingston (May 22, 1926 – July 1981), an accomplished flute player, who became a lawyer, judge and former Louisiana Supreme Court justice. She was one of the first female judges in the city of New Orleans. They married in Tunisia, and spent time in Casablanca, where Connick Sr. contracted Tuberculosis. They were sent back to the United States, and eventually ended up back in New Orleans. Harry and Anita Connick returned to New Orleans, they opened a record store. Ultimately they owned two stores while simultaneously pursuing law degrees, one working in the store while the other was at school. They also had a daughter, Suzanna, and a son, Harry, Jr. Anita Connick died of ovarian cancer, aged 55, in 1981. Connick later married Londa Jean Matherne. Connick is the uncle of Jefferson Parish District Attorney Paul Connick and State Representative Patrick Connick, also of Jefferson Parish.
Music and Life In New Orleans.
Connick was and continues to be very involved in New Orleans music and culture. In 1993, he and his son were part of the group that founded Orpheus, a superkrewe that participates in annual Mardi Gras parades. He was nicknamed "The Singing District Attorney" by Times magazine. This nickname was given to him because he spent many nights singing in clubs in the French Quarter, including Maxwell's Toulouse Cabaret.
New Orleans District Attorney.
In 1973 Connick defeated incumbent New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison who had recently been tried and acquitted of corruption charges.
As district attorney, he was the defendant and petitioner in "Connick v. Myers", a free speech case in public employment law. In the case, Connick asked Sheila Myers to take a transfer to another position in his office. She had resisted, finally saying she would consider it after a meeting with Connick. Later the same day she distributed a questionnaire on issues of employee morale to her fellow prosecutors, after which Connick fired her.
Myers sued in federal court alleging Connick violated her First Amendment rights by firing her. He maintained she had been fired for refusing the transfer, but judge Jack Gordon of the Eastern District of Louisiana held that the distribution of the questionnaire was speech on a matter of public concern and thus constitutionally protected. Since the facts indicated to him that Myers had been fired for it, he ordered her reinstated. After the Fifth Circuit affirmed Gordon, the Supreme Court granted "certiorari" and narrowly reversed the ruling, holding that Myers' questionnaire largely touched on matters internal to the office that were not of public concern and thus she was lawfully fired.
In 1987, Connick waged an unsuccessful challenge to incumbent William J. "Billy" Guste, Jr. for the position of Louisiana Attorney General. Guste prevailed over Connick, 516,658 (54%) to 440,984 (46%). Both were registered Democrats, but in Louisiana a general election can feature two members of the same party.
In 1989, Connick was indicted on racketeering charges for aiding and abetting a gambling operation by returning gambling records to an arrested gambler. He stated that he returned the records to the man in question because he needed them to file tax returns. On July 25, 1990, he was acquitted. 
In 1995, while District Attorney, Connick promised to the Assassination Records Review Board and at a public meeting in New Orleans that he would donate the Garrison investigative files which were still in his office. While the Review Board was allowed to inventory the records in Connick's office but not immediately take them, a New Orleans TV station sent the Review Board a box full of original witness transcripts from Garrison's grand jury case. According to the Review Board's final report,
Connick reportedly instructed one of his investigators to destroy these documents after he took office. The investigator took them home instead and kept them until he found out about the Review Board. A battle ensued between Connick and the Review Board after Connick demanded that the papers were returned to him and threatening to withhold the investigation papers. After many subpoenas going both ways and with the help of the Justice Department the Review Board won, and all of the documents in question are in the JFK Collection.
In 2003, Connick did not seek re-election and was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield.
Controversies.
Prosecutorial misconducts and Innocents on Death Row.
There are several allegations of systemic misconduct by Connick and his prosecutors. "According to the Innocence Project, a national organization that represents incarcerated criminals claiming innocence, 36 men convicted in Orleans Parish during Connick's 30-year tenure as DA have made allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, and 19 have had their sentences overturned or reduced as a result." However, Connick has recently defended himself against these claims. John Simerman, in a recent article in the Times-Picayune, reaffirms that, “the sheer number of trials in Orleans Parish criminal court distorts the numbers.” Simerman continues, “In his last five years in office, the courthouse at Tulane and Broad handled nearly 2,200 trials, more than a third of the criminal trials in Louisiana.” Indeed, his office tried about 1,000 cases per year, as compared to the approximate 100 cases per year that the Garrison administration tried.
In the case of Shareef Cousin, Connick's attorneys withheld a key witness statement from the defense, arguing that the prosecution were under no legal obligation to disclose such information. As a result, Cousin was put on death row at the age of 16, but the conviction and death sentence was overturned after four years, in 1999.
Charges.
In 2007, a man named John Thompson, who was wrongfully convicted of murder by Connick's DA office due to evidence withholding, was awarded a $14 million verdict by a federal court jury. The jury found "that Thompson's 18 years behind bars (14 of which he spent in solitary confinement on death row) were caused by Connick's deliberate failure to train his prosecutors on their obligations to turn over exculpatory evidence". The Orleans Parish DA's office appealed and the case, "Connick v. Thompson", was orally argued before the U.S. Supreme Court during the October 2010 term. By a 5-4 vote split along ideological lines, the Supreme Court overturned the $14 million award in a decision issued on March 29, 2011. The majority opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, construed the series of admitted violations to not amount to a pattern of "similar" violations of "Brady v. Maryland" (1963), and such a pattern was necessary to hold Connick liable for the incompetence of his employees. The dissenting opinion, read from the bench by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, noted that Connick's office had in fact committed a pattern of violations, failing to disclose exculpatory blood type evidence, failing to disclose audio tapes of witness testimony, failing to disclose a deathbed confession of evidence destruction by the prosecuting attorney Gerry Deegan, and failing to disclose eyewitness identification of the killer that did not match Thompson. Ginsburg noted that the office had employee turnover so high a young attorney could advance to a senior supervisory position within four years, thus the office offered little training in ongoing developments in criminal procedure law despite its large number of inexperienced attorneys.

John Spargo

John Spargo (1876–1966) became a renowned expert in the history and crafts of Vermont. Spargo is best remembered as an early biographer of Karl Marx and as one of the leading public intellectuals affiliated with the Socialist Party of America during the progressive era of the early 20th Century.
Biography.
Early years.
Spargo was born on January 31, 1876, in the small village of Longdowns in the parish of Stithians, Cornwall, England. His parents were Thomas Spargo (1850–1920) and Jane Hocking Spargo (1851–1900), whose maiden name was also Spargo. As a young man, he trained as a stonecutter, and he later became a lay Methodist minister. He was attracted to the socialist doctrines of early English Marxist Henry Hyndman, particularly to his book "England for All."
Spargo was a largely self-educated man, but he did in 1894-95 take two courses through the Oxford University Extension Program, including one by economist J. A. Hobson. Spargo went to work in 1895, moving with his alcoholic father to Barry Docks in South Wales, where he was employed as a stonemason. Within a year after his arrival at Barry Dock, Spargo had started the first local of Hyndman's Social Democratic Federation (SDF), was elected president of the Barry Trades and Labour Council, became an editor of the "Barry Herald", and was elected a member of the National Executive Committee of the SDF.
As his biographer notes
"It was an amazing, meteoric progression for an uneducated stonemason from Western Cornwall that took place in these few years of Spargo's education in Marxism; by the end of his residence in Britain, the 25-year-old was recognized as one of the most promising and energetic Marxist agitators in the country. Through it all, he was guided, inspired, and sustained by the Social Democratic Federation's founder and leader, Henry Meyers Hyndman, the man whose England for All had converted him to Marxism and who for the rest of his life would remain Spargo's model, mentor, and friend."
Spargo's political ideas in this early period were an amalgam of Christian Socialism and Marxism, simultaneously seeking the brotherhood of man by following "the true principles of the man of Galillee," while embracing science and the belief in the rule of the working class as the motive force to create social change.
In January 1900, Spargo married Prudence Edwards, a clerk from Lancashire, England who shared her new husband's socialist politics. The couple had one son, named after Christian Socialist leader George Herron.
In 1900, Spargo participated in some of the preliminary meetings which brought together representatives of the SDF, the Independent Labour Party, the Fabian Society, and various trade unions and cooperative societies to form the Labour Parliamentary Representation Committee, a direct forerunner of the British Labour Party. This drive of the SDF to unite with various non-Marxist organizations brought about an immediate reaction from the party's hardline "impossibilist" left wing, who sought revolutionary transformation rather than incremental, piecemeal parliamentary reforms. The rise of the left caused Hyndman to temporarily leave the SDF's executive council and alienated Spargo to some extent from the party. Providentially, Spargo received at this time an invitation from the private lecture bureau to travel to America to spend a couple months traveling the country, speaking about socialism. And so the newlyweds sailed for America and ultimately a new life there
Coming to America.
John and Prudence Spargo arrived at the port of New York in February 1901. The promised lecture series proved to be vastly exaggerated and Spargo wound up standing in bread lines to get food and shoveling snow from the sidewalks of the city for $7.50 a week. Eventually a few socialist lectures did come and Spargo made the acquaintance of many leading radicals in the city, including Christian Socialist George D. Herron, Job Harriman, and Algernon Lee. Spargo cast his lot with the dissident (and newly independent wing of the Socialist Labor Party headed by Henry Slobodin and Morris Hillquit, teaching at a SLP education center in Brooklyn, and working as an assistant to the lawyer Hillquit.
Spargo also assumed the role of editor of an illustrated socialist monthly based in New York, "The Comrade." The Spargos spent the next eight years living in a small apartment in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, with Spargo spending much of his time traveling the country as a paid lecturer. When the New York SLP dissidents merged with the midwestern Social Democratic Party of America headed by Victor L. Berger and Eugene Debs to establish the Socialist Party of America (SPA), Spargo was a founding member — although he was not in attendance at the Indianapolis Convention which established the organization in the summer of 1901.
With regard to his travels on behalf of the American socialist movement as a lecturer, Spargo's biographer notes
"It was well known that on many of his trips Spargo cavorted with a number of attractive ladies, and he quickly built a reputation not just as an effective socialist organizer but as a womanizer of some note... There was nothing unusual in this, since the early-20th century intellectuals who crowded New York's socialist circles tended to embrace free love as an indispensable dimension of their newfound aesthetics. In Spargo's case, however, the sexual cavorting led to some tricky situations, and once he had to borrow some 200 dollars from Hillquit to pay off a blackmailer who knew too much of some compromising tryst."
Spargo continued as editor of "The Comrade" until April 1904. In May of that same year, he travelled to Chicago and attended the second convention of the Socialist Party as a delegate from New York. At the convention, Spargo was elected Chairman of the Resolutions Committee and he reported as such to the conclave. Among other topics, the committee passed resolutions attacking the payment of "exorbitant fees or salaries" of socialist speakers and lecturers and condemning "all propaganda organizations, not connected with the Socialist Party, doing Socialist propaganda" and declaring membership in any such organization to be "sufficient cause for expulsion" from the SPA.
Spargo also took to the floor of the convention in opposition to the establishment of a national party-owned newspaper, a demand put forward by delegates from the left wing state organizations of the Pacific Coast but regarded as anathema by moderate Easterners who had fairly recently defected from the centralized Socialist Labor Party dominated by party editor Daniel DeLeon. Spargo declared
"I am opposed to a national party-owned organ because I am opposed to the heresy hunter all the time. "(Applause.)" I am opposed to a national party-owned organ because I will not trust the party integrity, I will not trust the party interests, I will not trust the party faith to the judgment of any one man, no matter how great he may be. "(Applause.)" If Editor Wayland, of the" Appeal to Reason," makes a mistake, the Socialist Party stands firm, but if somebody who is declared to be for the time being the infallible literary pope of the movement makes a mistake, that mistake carries with it the Socialist Party." "(Applause.)" 
Spargo's position won the day at the 1904 Socialist Party convention and it was not until 1914 until the organization finally established a party-owned weekly newspaper.
Spargo's first wife, Prudence, died of tuberculosis in March 1904. A year and 10 days later, he married Amelia Rose Bennetts, a British-born New York socialist who had lived in America from early childhood and who had recently been employed as a worker in a carpet mill. The couple set up house in Yonkers, New York, and had two children, a daughter named Mary and a son (who died in childhood) named John Jr.
Spargo was elected to the National Committee of the Socialist Party in 1905 and to the governing National Executive Committee in 1909. As his biographer notes, during this period Spargo began "easing his way toward the reformist right-wing" of the SPA, giving up on the tactic of agitation among striking workers in favor of building middle class socialist educational institutions. Spargo was instrumental in helping establish the Rand School of Social Science, persuading George D. Herron and his wife Carrie Rand Herron to make a large bequest and Mrs. Herron's mother to provide seed money for the new institution. Spargo also was a co-founder of the Intercollegiate Socialist Society (ISS), an organization dedicated to the establishment of non-partisan socialist study groups on college campuses and sponsoring debates and lectures on socialist topics. Spargo would later serve on the ISS executive from 1916 to 1919.
Spargo wrote a series of compassionate, well-researched books, "The Bitter Cry of the Children" (1905), "Underfed School Children" (1906), and "The Common Sense of the Milk Question" (1908). Both concerned child slavery in British and American factories and arguing for the state-funded feeding of underprivileged children on the grounds that it was pointless attempting to teach children distracted by hunger, a concept that very successfully came into fruition in America during WWII.
He felt deeply about the issue, later writing that: "The claim for an equal chance for every child born into the world carries with it that most fundamental of claims, that every child has a right to be well-born into the world. And that ideal can never be realized until every mother-to-be is safeguarded by all the arts and resources of our civilization to the end that she may bring her baby into the world with joy–healthy of body, glad of heart, serene of soul, unafraid of the future, unterrified by want or the fear of it, secure in the consciousness that the child she bears is heir to all the riches and advantages of earth."
In 1908, Spargo authored a lengthy and academically serious biography of Karl Marx, his book being recognized as the best such treatment published in the English language at the time.
The same year, Spargo was elected as a delegate to the 1908 National Convention of the Socialist Party, held again at Chicago. Spargo was returned by the convention to the post he had held at the previous national gathering, Chairman of the Resolutions Committee. Spargo was influential in defeating through parliamentary procedure a resolution moved by a majority of the Resolutions Committee calling for the future exclusion of Asian workers from America. Spargo's opposition to the resolution was based upon the principle of state autonomy of local parties rather than upon internationalism and the social equality of the races:
"Comrades, I ask you to vote that we are a party of the working class, that it is the economic interest of the working class which must guide our party, that we leave it to the states themselves to decide if they have an Asiatic problem. They can decide it upon the basis of local state autonomy, and, above all, I ask that you recognize that the immigration problem is a big problem, a complex problem..."
Factional politics of the early 'teens.
During the years 1909 to 1914, Spargo continued his reconsideration of socialist theory and practice and emerged as a top leader of the Socialist Party's right wing. He was diagnosed with a heart ailment and suffered from a lung infection which claimed the life of his younger son, so the Spargos moved to a new home in the hamlet of Old Bennington, Vermont, close to the New York border in the southwestern corner of the state. There the ailing Spargo recovered from his illness and was soon back on the road lecturing on socialist themes.
Spargo was one of 24 delegates of the Socialist Party (along with, incidentally, Industrial Workers of the World leader "Big Bill" Haywood) to the 1910 Congress of the International, held in Copenhagen, Denmark, from August 28 to September 4, 1910. The gathering discussed matters relating to international relations between socialist parties, the trade union movement, disarmament, and the progress of labor legislation in the various countries.
Spargo was a bitter opponent of the syndicalism which was sweeping parts of the Socialist Party and staunchly supported the established craft unionism of the American Federation of Labor against the radical industrial unionism of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). A battle royal between the dominant center-right coalition that controlled the Socialist Party and its pro-syndicalist left wing erupted in 1912. As Spargo's biographer notes:
"Throughout, the faction fight was about much more than just a struggle for power. To Spargo and his fellow right-wingers, it subsumed under its rubric the larger question of where and how the socialist movement was headed, that is, whether it was to be led by those schooled in theoretical Marxian exegesis and historical study or by those who discarded such exegesis and study and opted instead for direct catastrophic action."
The brewing skirmish erupted into an open fight at the 1912 National Convention of the Socialist Party, to which Spargo was once again a delegate from New York as well as the elected Chairman of the Resolutions Committee. At issue was language to be inserted into the party constitution which called for the expulsion of "any member of the party who opposes political action or advocates crime, sabotage, or other methods of violence as a weapon of the working class to aid in its emancipation." The debate was vitriolic, with Victor L. Berger of Wisconsin stating the matter in its most bellicose form:
"Comrades, the trouble with our party is that we have men in our councils who claim to be in favor of political action when they are not. We have a number of men who use our political organization — our Socialist Party — as a cloak for what they call direct action, for IWW-ism, sabotage and syndicalism. It is anarchism by a new name...
"Comrades, I have gone through a number of splits in this party. It was not always a fight against anarchism in the past. In the past we often had to fight Utopianism and fanaticism. Now it is anarchism again that is eating away at the vitals of our party.
"If there is to be a parting of the ways, if there is to be a split — and it seems that you will have it, and must have it — then, I am ready to split right here. I am ready to go back to Milwaukee and appeal to the Socialists all over the country to cut this cancer out of our organization."
Spargo played a leading role in this purge of the party's left wing with his 1913 book entitled "Syndicalism, Industrial Unionism and Socialism," an attack on the syndicalism of the IWW and its supporters. Spargo charged that the IWW's tactic of encouraging sabotage would have the effect of undermining the honor, courage, and self-respect of the working class, causing it to lose sight of the spiritual ideals of socialism. He held that the "IWW form of organization which denies autonomy to local unions and centralizes power in the hands of the executive, really involves the ideal of a bureaucratic government in the future society." For Spargo, the ideal of "one big union" meant in practice "authoritarianism and bureaucracy" and "the creation of a despotic industrial State in place of a political State." He asked his readers, "If all the unions are to be centralized in one big union and its power centralized in the hands of a single authority, can the government of society by that union be other than democratic?"
While many adhering to the syndicalist and revolutionary socialist ideals of the SPA's left wing exited the party following their defeat at the 1912 National Convention and the successful recall of "Big Bill" Haywood from the party's National Executive Committee, there remained a strong radical current in the party, dissatisfied with the temporizing parliamentarism of the party majority. In the summer of 1914 would come an issue which would sweep the syndicalist controversy aside and fundamentally alter political discourse within the international socialist movement and the Socialist Party of America — the crisis of international war in Europe.
The year 1912 also marked Spargo's only foray into American electoral politics, when he ran for the United States Congress in the 1st Congressional District of Vermont as the nominee of the Socialist Party. Spargo received 456 votes, as opposed to the more than 3,000 that the victorious candidate received.
The war and after.
At the 1917 National Convention of the Socialist Party, Spargo was the author of a minority resolution in the Committee on War and Militarism calling for American support of the Allied war effort as the least onerous alternative facing the socialist movement. This proposal was decisively defeated, garnering the support of only 5 delegates, in favor of the militant St. Louis Resolution, which called for an active struggle against the American war effort. Up until the party voted to ratify the St. Louis Resolution, Spargo clung to the hope that a moderate majority of the rank and file would endorse his own views of the European conflict. When, on the other hand, the party's membership enthusiastically endorsed the party's line established at the 1917 convention, Spargo decided to make a decisive exit from the organization. On May 30, 1917, he resigned his seat on the SP's governing National Executive Committee, followed three days later by his resignation from the party itself.
Spargo wrote to his former comrade Morris Hillquit, co-author of the St. Louis Resolution, that his resignation from the Socialist Party "probably means the end of practically everything. In the absence of any other Socialist organization in which I can function, I shall probably devote myself exclusively to my personal affairs and leave the political struggle alone."
Spargo did not drop out of politics, however, choosing instead to actively endorse and collaborate with the Wilson administration in its war effort. He conceived of the US government-sponsored pro-war labor organization the American Alliance for Labor and Democracy, which together with Samuel Gompers of the AF of L he subsequently helped lead, and for which he occasionally wrote. Spargo also joined the Social Democratic League of America (SDL), a pro-war organization which emerged through the venerable socialist weekly, the "Appeal to Reason" — now named "The New Appeal" by its pro-war editors, Louis Kopelin and Emanuel Haldeman-Julius. Spargo was chosen as the first Chairman of the SDL, with Haldeman-Julius apparently handling the day-to-day operations of the organization through the offices of the "Appeal" in Girard, Kansas.
Spargo conceived of the SDL as a group akin to the Independent Labour Party in England and sought to involve it in a broader pro-war organization analogous to the British Labour Party. Spargo himself conceived of this broader group, the National Party, and sat on the Executive Committee of this new political organization. The National Party dissolved following disappointing returns in the elections of 1918.
By the middle 1920s, Spargo had turned away from leftist politics, developing his own theories of what he called "socialized individualism". He became a member of the Republican Party, supported Calvin Coolidge in the election of 1924, and was regarded as a prospective United States Secretary of Labor during the presidency of Herbert Hoover. His biographer characterized the change as that from a "Marxian socialist who became a Goldwater Republican and was throughout an American anti-communist.
Spargo became the director-curator of the Bennington, Vermont Historical Museum and wrote several books on ceramics.
He researched and wrote a booklet on the history of his family name. Spargo is also the name of the locality around Mabe Church in the parish of Mabe. He postulated that evidence supported the place name and Spargo family name being in existence c. 400AD. This pre-dated the arrival by some 400 years of the Christian Church.

Paul Staveley O'Duffy

Paul O’Duffy (born 1963, London) is a British record producer, composer, mixer. He is best known for producing Swing Out Sister's Grammy-nominated multi-platinum debut album, for his BMI nomination as 'Producer of the Year' in 1987, and work with John Barry and other film score producing. More recently he worked with Amy Winehouse, co-writing one of the tracks on her multi-platinum album "Back to Black".
Professional life.
Mixer / engineer.
O’Duffy started out his music career at Marcus Music Studios London, and by the age of 17 was engineering sessions for War, Yes and Marvin Gaye. He moved to New York in 1984, establishing himself as a club remixer working on remixes for artists such as KC and The Sunshine Band, Man Parrish, Stephanie Mills, The System, Animotion, The Bar-Kays, Patti Labelle, Ian Dury and the Blockheads and Freeze.
Production.
O'Duffy returned to London in the late eighties where his remixing successes took him into record production. His first production success was the debut album by Scottish group Hipsway which included the top twenty hit on both sides of the Atlantic, "Honeythief". He followed this up with production on the number one platinum selling debut album by Curiosity Killed the Cat "Keep Your Distance". 
His BMI nomination for Producer of the Year in 1987 came from his work on the multi-platinum debut album "It's Better To Travel" by Manchester group Swing Out Sister, which included the worldwide hit "Breakout". The album was also nominated in the US for a Grammy Award and led to more work for him and his distinctive retro sound with US acts. 
One of these was eccentric Pop R&B group Was Not Was with the resulting worldwide hits "Walk The Dinosaur", "Spy In The House Of Love" and platinum selling album "What Up, Dog?". At the other end of the spectrum O’Duffy produced one of Barry Manilow’s last chart hits "Keep Each Other Warm" from his eponymous album "Barry Manilow", in which he recorded other artists’ songs using a variety of top producers.
O’Duffy additionally produced and mixed Tom Verlaine’s (Television) critically acclaimed solo album "Flash Light" in 1987.
Starting in 2009, he is producing John Barry's orchestral album, "The Seasons".
Writer/producer.
In the Nineties O’Duffy increased his songwriting credits, producing and writing on four subsequent albums for Swing Out Sister (including 1992's "Get in Touch with Yourself") as well as production for Dusty Springfield on her album "Reputation", which became Springfield's best-selling new album since her '60s-era peak. He produced the Pretenders' "If There Was a Man" and "Where Has Everybody Gone?", as well as Necros, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Jeff Beck, Lisa Stansfield, Danny Wilson, The Beloved, John Barry, the eponymous debut album by Lewis Taylor, Joe Meek and Pigeonhead.
Hiatus and recovery.
An amateur racer of both off-road and on-road motorcycles, O’Duffy was riding a road bike in London when a car cut across his lane and ran him down. His back was broken in two places, and he spent many months in traction and several years in recovery. His motorcycle, a Ducati 888 SP5 limited edition which had been given to him by his then management team, was repaired and presented back to him after a chance meeting with Federico Minoli then-head of Ducati worldwide at the Houses of Parliament. Now fully recovered after further surgery to fuse his back, O’Duffy is back racing in Seniors races.
During the first three years after the accident, O’Duffy worked almost exclusively out of the substantial studio he had built at his home in North London. It was here that Amy Winehouse came to spend a month in 2006 to work on tracks for what became the "Back to Black" album, which features the O’Duffy/Winehouse song "Wake up Alone".
Film and television.
O’Duffy produced the John Barry score for 007 film "The Living Daylights" (winner, 1988 BMI Film Music Award).
Further work with Barry continued, including in 1992 the movie "Chaplin" starring Robert Downey Jr, for which Barry was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Recently O’Duffy worked with John Barry on his UK concerts at the Albert Hall. 
O’Duffy produced the Hans Zimmer score for the film "Days of Thunder" (winner, 1991 BMI Film Music Award), and is infamous for his unique treatment of the version of "All By Myself" used in the film "Bridget Jones Diary". He also produced the Dr Calculus track "Full of Love" for the 1988 Kevin Bacon film "She’s Having a Baby". 
O’Duffy is also a well-known composer for television, having composed the themes and incidental music for: "The Team - A Season With Mclaren" (BBC2 series) "The Great Outdoors" (Channel 4 series) "The Big Elsewhere" (with Swing Out Sister, NHK Japan series) "London Bridge" (Carlton TV drama series).

Camp Evans Historic District

Camp Evans Historic District is an area of the Camp Evans Formerly Used Defense Site in Wall Township, New Jersey. The site of the military installation () is noted for a 1914 transatlantic radio receiver and various WWII/Cold War laboratories of the United States Army (e.g., signal, vacuum tube, dosimetry, & photo-optics).
Belmar Receiving Station.
The Belmar Receiving Station was established near the Belmar community together with a separate transatlantic transmitting facility at New Brunswick, New Jersey, by the American Marconi Company. The Belmar station included "a mile-long bronze-wire receiving antenna strung on six 400 foot tall masts with three 150 foot balancing towers along the Shark River. Outgoing Morse-code messages were sent via a telegraph land-line from the Belmar Station to the transmitter." The receiving site also had a telegraph land-line to a New York office.
Original buildings () were built by the J.G. White Engineering Corp. between 1912 and 1914 as part of Guglielmo Marconi's "wireless girdle" around the Earth. In one of the buildings being constructed for the Belmar station, the regenerative circuit was demonstrated on January 31/February 1, 1914.
In April 1917, the Belmar station was acquired as part of the Navy's World War I "Trans-Atlantic Communication System" and after the November 1918 Armistice with Germany, Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America regained the Belmar station, which Radio Corporation of America owned from October 1919 until 1924.
Club and college site.
After "the Monmouth Pleasure Club was organized on or about June 30, 1923, by the membership of the Asbury Park Klan for the purpose of securing certain real estate", the Belmar station was owned 1925-35 by the Monmouth County Pleasure Club which had a 1929 lawsuit about its "$1,000,000 piece of Monmouth County (N.J.) real estate."
The Young People's Association for the Propagation of the Gospel purchased the Belmar station in 1936, and The King's College opened in September 1938—when it was denied accreditation it relocated (currently is in the Empire State Building.)
The Signal Corps Radar Laboratory (SCRL) of Fort Hancock (formerly "Field Laboratory No. 3") in the late 1930s used "a field set-up at" the Belmar station to compare US radars with the British CH-CHL Radars. (additional testing of hardware was "often done" at the nearby Twin Lights radar station, e.g., a trial radar network in 1939.)
Evans Signal Laboratory.
In 1941 the Belmar radio "site was renamed the Evans Signal Laboratory" after Wall Township purchased "the original Marconi buildings and the surrounding 93 acres" for the Army to move the SCRL. Initial construction "quickly built more than two dozen buildings and structures on the open land to the south and west of the Marconi buildings", including 2 boiler houses, 4 long rectangular one-story buildings, and "two groups of radio antenna shelters". Two models of the SCR-271 radar "were located near the intersection of Monmouth Boulevard and Watson Road" (the model D had a sign for the SCRL Installation and Maintenance School).
Camp Evans.
Camp Evans was designated by "War Department General Order, 17 February 1942"; the Camp Evans Signal Laboratory was named on March 31, 1942 (the date of the camp's dedication); and in December 1942, the War Department directed the Signal Corps General Development Laboratories and the Camp Evans Signal Lab to combine into the Signal Corps Ground Service (SCGS) with headquarters at Bradley Beach, New Jersey (Hotel Grossman). The Camp Evans lab used "] to adapt SCR-268s for" picket ships, modified the SCR-268 into the SCR-602 which detected Japanese kamikazes (producing 12 renumbered AN/TPQ-3 developmental models) and on the SCR-584 tracking radar, did preliminary testing in December 1941 and added identification friend or foe. The lab also improved components (e.g., for the proximity fuse) and established a special unit which tested captured German and Japanese radars. The laboratory was also responsible for Army radar development by civilian companies (e.g., GE AN/CPS-1 early warning radar, Rad Lab AN/CPS-4 height finder, Bendix AN/GPN-2 & LE AN/GPN-6 search sets, and Bendix AN/CPN-18 secondary surveillance radar).
By August 1943, Lt Col Paul E. Watson was the director of the Camp Evans Signal Laboratory. In addition to the Signal lab, Camp Evans had the Joint Army-Navy Tube Standardization (JANS) Laboratory and in May 1945, the Signal Corps Ground Services was reformed into the Signal Corps Engineering Laboratories. "Initial experimentation with an enemy mortar and artillery locating radar was conducted at Camp Evans in 1944." By the end of the war Camp Evans had "approximately 134 buildings and structures on approximately 217-acres" including the "Meteorological Branch of the Army Signal Corps" (cf. the Meteorological Branch at McCook Field).
Closure.
The 1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission at the end of the Cold War designated Camp Evans for closure (e.g., the Army Radiation Dosimetry Laboratory closed in 1999) Evans units moved to Fort Monmouth's "Main Post" (Project 42682), and Camp Evans land transferred to the National Park Service. The Infoage Science/History Learning Center was established in some of the historic district buildings (e.g., Bldg 9116 has "Radio Room One). A section of the former camp also became the Wall Higher Education Center of the Brookdale Community College.
A district of Camp Evans was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002, and camp areas became part of the Save America's Treasures project (2005 funds were donated to restore the AN/TLM-18.) In 2011, Institute for Exploratory Research began in "the basement at the InfoAge Science Center".

Simple series

The Simple series are a number of series of budget-priced console games, published by Japanese company D3 Publisher and developed by a variety of companies, covering many systems. The price of the games in yen (not including tax) is included in the title of the series - for example Simple 2000 is about 2000¥. 
The games are usually characterised by their distinctive package design featuring artwork surrounded by a black border, with the game's title (usually prefixed by "The" in English) in a plain white font. The series name and volume are also displayed prominently.
The early games in the PlayStation Simple 1500 series were generic interpretations of common video game themes, such as mahjong, tennis or racing. However the various series now cover many more original and unusual titles in addition to those based on concepts. Since the games are almost universally created on a low budget with a short development time, developers are able to experiment to some extent with titles such as "The Daibijin", which has attracted attention largely due to its central premise of a giant bikini-clad woman attacking a city, rather than any gameplay or graphical merits.
A producer at D3 Publisher has stated that the company will not be able to continue the "Simple series" on what was then "next-gen" HD systems (i.e. seventh generation). The "Simple Wii Series" dedicated to the Wii console was recently created, however. This is because the Wii had similar architecture to the older 6th generation consoles, making budget-style games easier to make. 
Developers.
D3 Publisher employs a number of external developers for the series, some of the most prolific being Tamsoft and HuneX - most are smaller or little-known companies, although several games have been licensed from Taito for a (usually enhanced) re-release. 
Notable games.
Certain "Simple series" titles have attracted considerable interest outside of Japan for various reasons, either gameplay quality or a particularly unique idea - these include "The OneChanbara" and its sequels, as well as Sandlot's "The Chikyū Bōeigun" and "Global Defence Force", which were based on their Gigantic Drive engine and were of considerably higher quality than most games in the series. Both of these series' have had sequels for the Microsoft Xbox 360 video game console, although they were originally labelled under an "X" moniker ("OneChanbara X" and "Earth Defense Force X") rather than a "Simple" one.
International releases.
Many of the PlayStation 2 Simple 2000 games have been released in PAL regions as budget titles by Midas Interactive Entertainment, Agetec or 505 GameStreet, usually under different titles and with new cover art; recently D3 Publisher of Europe has released several titles itself under the "Essential Games" brand. Additionally, several of the PlayStation Simple 1500 games were released in the US (by Agetec) and Europe (by Midas and Phoenix Games). Despite the recent establishment of D3 Publisher of America, the only game in the Simple 2000 series to gain a North American release was "The Bass Fishing" (as "Fisherman's Bass Club"); this is believed to be due to SCEA's more restrictive licensing policy.

Hatesex

Hatesex is a Los Angeles-based goth rock band, founded by former Diva Destruction guitarist Benn Ra and vocalist Krisanna Marie.
History.
Hatesex was formed in 2003 by Benn Ra, ex-guitarist for Diva Destruction and vocalist Krisanna Marie after meeting through a musicians' advertisement. Working together, the band began developing material for their first release, "The Spiritual Palsy", an EP limited to 100 copies. The EP showcased the wide variety of influences the band exhibited and featured a collaboration with Swiss band Celtic Frost on a "gothicized" version of the 1983 Slayer song "Black Magic". The EP met with worldwide acclaim and all four songs featured on the EP received widespread play in dance clubs all over Europe. 
The EP's success led to the band signing a recording contract with the Dark Dimensions label group based in Germany. The band's first full-length CD, entitled "Unwant", was released on September 26, 2005 and featured 11 songs, including the four songs from "The Spiritual Palsy" EP. The 2005 release followed a 2006 performance at the Wave-Gotik-Treffen festival in Leipzig, Germany. On February 18, 2011, they released their second album "A Savage Cabaret, She Said", which features artwork by photographer and artist Tas Limur [http://www.taslimur.com]. The album was influenced by Marie's involvement in the Cabaret and Burlesque community and is considered a concept album where the lyrics match the CD artwork in an overall theme. The concept was based loosely off of The Seven Deadly Sins. In a 2011 Zillo magazine interview Marie stated "I was staying in Italy and someone had scraped the words ‘Savage Cabaret’ on the back door at a pizza parlor. It stuck with me for days. A few nights later I sat on a balcony with some friends discussing and trying to remember all the names of the seven sins. The next day I was in Rome waiting to catch a plane back to Berlin and this vision came to me that life was a bizarre cabaret production full of strange characters and sins."

St Paul's Girls' School

St Paul's Girls' School is an independent day school for girls, located in Brook Green, Hammersmith, in West London, England. It is one of a handful of schools in the country which does not have a prescribed school uniform.
History.
St Paul’s Girls’ School was founded by the Worshipful Company of Mercers in 1904, using part of the endowment of the foundation set up by John Colet, to create a girls’ school to complement the boys' school he had founded in the sixteenth century. The governors hold proprietorial responsibility, and some are representatives of the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge and London.
The buildings for the school were designed by the architect Gerald Horsley, the son of the painter John Callcott Horsley and one of the founder members of the Art Workers Guild.
The school has had several distinguished directors of music, most notably Gustav Holst (1905–34) and Herbert Howells (1936–62). Holst composed his "St Paul's" and "Brook Green" suites for the pupils at the school. Holst also composed what is arguably his most well known work, "The Planets", while teaching at St Paul's.
Curriculum.
The curriculum comprises the traditional ingredients of a liberal education with some more modern additions (such as drama GCSE). Every student follows a set curriculum in years 7, 8 and 9 but as they move up the school they have more and more ability to develop their own programme of study. The GCSE curriculum has room for up to four optional subjects and the A-level curriculum consists entirely of options. The 2011 ISI inspection rated the curriculum as "excellent".
Exam results.
St Paul's girls have regularly performed extremely well in the GCSEs and A Levels.
Over a third of girls at the school get all A*s in their GCSEs and many take extra language or maths GCSEs.
In 2012, 99.14% of GCSEs were graded at A*s or As with 89.14% graded at A* alone. This was the highest ever A* percentage achieved by the school and in the country.
Music.
Gustav Holst was Director of Music at the school during the period he composed his orchestral suites, including "St Paul's Suite" and "The Planets"; he was succeeded by Herbert Howells before John Gardner followed in the 1950s. Gardner wrote many memorable pieces for the school, including his popular Christmas carols "Tomorrow Shall be My Dancing Day" and "The Holly and the Ivy".
The school has many music programmes, for mainstream pupils, and also scholarship or advanced pupils. The training orchestra, called the "Sinfonia", is generally for years 7-9, however some lower ability students stay on. It trains for one and a half hours a week. The advanced orchestra, called the "Symphony", is generally for years 10 and above, however, higher ability and scholarship musicians from younger year groups perform in it as well. It trains for two hours a week. There are also a number of string, brass and flute groups, as well as a wind band.
The school also has a choral programme. For Lower School students (ages 11–13), there is the Junior Choir. For Middle School Students (ages 14–16) there is a Middle School Choir. Both of these are open to all. However, for the Senior School (ages 16–18), there is a select choir. For the entire school, there is an advanced choir - "Paulina Voices" - to which admission is by audition only.
Sport.
The school has several sports fields, halls and tennis courts. Generally regarded as the schools' main sport, lacrosse remains a focus, with teams regularly touring. Netball is also popular, as is rowing. Girls from year 7-9 will also take part in athletics, gymnastics, dance, swimming and many other sports such as football and lifesaving. These are provided for by the well-equipped sports building, which houses a large sports hall, dance studio and fitness gym, as well as offices and changing rooms. In sport, the school is a traditional rival of Lady Eleanor Holles, Godolphin and Latymer (another independent girls' school situated in Hammersmith), and Latymer Upper School.
Writing.
The school has numerous pupil-run magazines and newspapers: these include, but are not limited to, "The Marble", "M2", "Marmor" (the classics magazine, Latin for "marble"), "Words" (the creative writing magazine), and "The Foreigner" (the modern languages magazine).
The main school creative writing competition, the Monica Dickens, runs once a year, although there are others, and the school is also represented at national creative writing competitions: in the past two years alone Paulinas have won or been highly commended in the Foyle Young Poet of the Year competition, the BBC Wildlife Poet of the Year competition, the Christopher Tower Poetry Competition with Corpus Christi, the Martin Wills (three Paulinas were shortlisted in the 2009 competition), the Artsrichmond Young Writers Festival. Every year a delegation attends the Arvon courses, entry into which is competitive.
Drama.
The school's main theatre, named after alumna Celia Johnson, is where most school productions are staged. The drama studio is another, smaller, space where many of the other productions are staged. Both are black box. Productions have, in the past, been performed elsewhere in the school, including the Great Hall and the Singing Hall.
Students are able to put on 'studio productions' where they direct, produce, tech and act in a play of their choosing. This is open to the whole school.
The Colet Play is put on annually by the girls of the Seventh (Year 12). Voted for from a pool of proposals, the production is undertaken independently of the school, though its premises are used. In recent years several productions have been performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, often with critical success.
The VIIIth play is an annual undertaking for the Eighth (year 13), where a member of staff not in the drama department directs a play of their choice. Recent VIIIth plays have included 'The Love of the Nightingale' and 'The Changeling'.
The leavers' revue is another annual tradition, written and performed by the outgoing Eighth (Year 13) to the rest of the school. In recent years the revue has undergone numerous name changes; from the Eighth Revue to the Eighth Event, the Eighth Charity Event, and, in 2009, the Eighth Burlesque. In 2010 the title returned to The Eighth Revue. Advertisement for the VIIIth Revue has in recent years borne the slogan 'It's Coming'.
Drama club runs on a weekly basis for students in the MIVth (year 7) and the UIVth (year 8) where they devise short performances, and junior and senior improv club also run. Commedia dell'arte troupe has been running for several years. The Theatre Society runs trips to theatre events around London, chosen by the Theatre Society Committee made up of senior girls. Several trips also run throughout the year to theatres to support learning in other subjects such as history, English, classics and modern foreign languages.
Every couple of years, the school puts on a large musical, which involves a multitude of girls from all years and is usually in collaboration with St. Paul's School (the boys's school). Former productions have been Broadway classics such as 'Sweet Charity' and 'Les Misérables'. There is normally also a play in the autumn term.
Recent and current performances at the school include (but are not limited to)'Much Ado about Nothing','Guys and Dolls' 'Medea'(in the original Greek) and devised cautionary tales.
Fees.
For students joining in Y7,8,9 and 10, the fee per term is £5,842, including lunch and personal accident insurance but excluding textbooks and other extras. For students joining in Y12, the termly fee including lunch and insurance is £6,280. Music lessons, extra sports coaching and life drawing classes are charged extra and, thus, the costs for the vast majority of pupils amount to approximately £20,000 a year. In addition, £200 per annum are awarded toward potential academic school trips, although due to the large array of opportunities on offer, many Paulinas have trip fees exceeding £3,000 per year. For example, a recent music tour of the United States cost over £1,000 and a trip to Malawi costs £2500. Trips are, however, usually funded by the school for pupils on scholarships or bursaries.
Bursaries and scholarships.
Bursaries.
The school awards up to twenty means-tested bursaries to students who join in Y7 (two of which are funded by HSBC), and up to five more bursaries for students arriving in Y12. For candidates who join in Y12, there is also the Ogden Trust science award for a UK citizen currently at a non-independent school who wants to study both physics and maths at A level.
Bursaries fund up to 100 per cent of tuition fees on a sliding scale depending on annual family income, assets and other information, plus exam entry fees and a grant towards textbooks. Holders of 100 per cent bursaries entering in Y12 also receive an extra package to cover the cost of sports uniforms and equipment, travel (where not covered by free London bus travel for under 18s), an annual contribution towards school visits and free tuition in one musical instrument.
Scholarships.
Year 7: The school awards up to four academic scholarships and two music scholarships to 11+ entrants (worth £100 a year; the music scholarship also includes free tuition in one instrument).
Year 12: The school may also award two music scholarships to current students and two more to new joiners (worth £250 a year plus free tuition in two instruments), and two art scholarships (worth £250 a year) to internal and external candidates. The Nora Day music scholarship (worth up to 50% of school fees plus free tuition in two instruments) is awarded every other year to a new joiner who shows exceptional musical potential. St Paul's also awards scholarships worth £250 a year for academic distinction in the 'Senior Scholarship', a dissertation written by students in Y12 during the Summer holiday following their AS exams.
Logo.
In 2007, the traditional wreath logo was redesigned and replaced by current High Mistress Clarissa Farr, provoking much controversy from students within the school and a Daily Mail article. According to the article, girls are 'disgusted' by the new design. The traditional wreath is now the symbol of the Old Paulina Alumnae Association.
It was announced in 2013 that the old logo would be reinstated.

Sven-Ole Thorsen

Sven-Ole Thorsen (born 24 September 1944) is a Danish actor, stuntman, bodybuilder and strongman competitor. Sven won Denmark's Strongest Man in 1983.
Using his stature he often plays imposing giants and villains in his films who are somehow beaten by smaller opponents in a David and Goliath manner, but he has also played heroic characters such as Gunnar the legendary warrior in "The Viking Sagas". His autobiography "Stærk mand i Hollywood" (Strong Man in Hollywood) was published on 26 October 2007, and was very well reviewed. The first printing of the book reportedly sold out in 24 hours.
Biography.
Career.
He is known for his frequent appearances in Arnold Schwarzenegger movies, like "Conan the Barbarian", as the hammer-wielding Thorgrim; "The Running Man", as the sympathetic bodyguard Sven; and in "Predator", where he played a one-second role as a Russian military advisor ('Knock Knock'). Some of his other most memorable characters have varied widely, from the gritty boater wearing security guard La Fours in "Mallrats", to the unbeaten fighting legend Tigris of Gaul in "Gladiator", and the witty Lt. Michael 'Tank' Ellis, Ground Assault Unit in "Captain Power", to the menacing alien villain Secundus in "Abraxas, Guardian of the Universe", who is always hunting for the Anti-Life Equation without any success.
Thorsen has been credited in fifteen Arnold Schwarzenegger movies () (twelve as actor, three as stuntman or trainer), making him Schwarzenegger's most frequent collaborator. It began with "Conan the Barbarian", when Schwarzenegger brought Thorsen and other of his bodybuilder friends (like Franco Columbu) with him to shoot the movie. Later, when Thorsen moved to the United States, he met Schwarzenegger again while he was acting in the movie "Commando". Thorsen helped with some of the stuntwork in that movie, and quickly found work in many of the subsequent Schwarzenegger films.
In spite of Thorsen's thick Danish accent, his voice is almost never dubbed (an exception being "Hard Target"). Thorsen pursued his role as Tigris (of Gaul) in "Gladiator" for over a year, beating Lou Ferrigno for the part. The part won him two TAURUS World Stunt Awards in the ceremony's inaugural year.
Thorsen has founded various federations, including The Danish Bodybuilding Federation in 1979 and "Cigar Night at Schatzi" in Santa Monica, California along with Schwarzenegger. He has a black belt in Shotokan karate and holds championship titles.
Personal life.
Sven-Ole Thorsen is 196 centimetres (6 feet, 5 inches) tall and while appearing in "Conan the Barbarian" (1982) he weighed 138 kilograms (304 lbs), according to his autobiography (page 24 + 110) from which most of the following information is taken.
He has two sons, Michael and Martin, from his first marriage.
Thorsen met his second wife, the Swedish circus-artist, snake-charmer, pop-singer and athlete Anniqa (born Anniqa Järle) in the 1970s, when she married his close friend, boxing champion Hans Jørgen Jacobsen; Anniqa and Sven-Ole Thorsen were married in 1982.
On his fortieth birthday, Anniqa and Sven-Ole Thorsen decided to move from Denmark to the USA, which they did in April 1985. The couple divorced in 1991.
Thorsen started dating Grace Jones in 1990, and as of 2007 they have maintained an open relationship. According to his autobiography, all his romantic relationships, marriages included, have been open relationships since the late 1970s.
In 1995, Thorsen started dating Erica Huff, daughter of the soul-singer Leon Huff. 
Sven-Ole Thorsen lives in Santa Monica in California and had two dogs, a Jack Russell Terrier named Jake and an American Bull Terrier named Cleo ( now dead ) he won the Danish "Show of Winners" Award of the Year 2006, honouring people who have a special affiliation with dogs.
In his spare time, Thorsen creates wooden sculptures and enjoys art, which he showed in Danish magazine Euroman. He is also famously fond of a good cigar.

Long Acre

Long Acre is a street in the City of Westminster in central London. It runs from St. Martin's Lane, at its western end, to Drury Lane in the east. The street was completed in the early 17th century and was once known for its coach-makers, and later for its car dealers.
Covent Garden tube station is located on Long Acre.
History.
After the dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540, Henry VIII confiscated the land belonging to Westminster Abbey, including the convent garden of Covent Garden and seven acres to the north called Long Acre. In 1552, his son, Edward VI, granted it to John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford. The Russell family, who in 1694 were advanced in their peerage from Earl to Duke of Bedford, held the land from 1552 to 1918.
Charles I took offence at the condition of the road and houses along it, which were the responsibility of Russell and Henry Carey, 2nd Earl of Monmouth. Russell and Carey complained that under the 1625 Proclamation concerning Buildings, which restricted building in and around London, they could not build new houses; the King then granted Russell, for a fee of £2,000, a licence to build as many new houses on his land as he "shall thinke fitt and convenient". This licence allowed the development of Covent Garden Square to the south of Long Acre.
The coach-building trade dominated Long Acre in the 19th century – in 1906, 41 buildings in the street were occupied by firms associated with transport, a mixture of traditional coach-builders and those connected with the motor trade. By 1916 the transition to motor cars and related trades was almost complete. The Mercedes-Benz showroom was at No. 127–130, close to Daimler and Fiat. 
The section on the north side from Neal Street to Arne Street was occupied by Odhams Press from about 1890 to 1970. It published "John Bull", which was the most popular magazine in Britain from 1916 to 1934. Odhams also published "The Daily Herald", "Women's Own", "Debrett's" and "Sporting Life" (founded 1859). Odhams was bought by the International Publishing Corporation in 1961 and the site was closed down in 1969. Prior to Odhams, the site was occupied by the Queen's Theatre (1867–1878), the second-largest theatre in London at the time, after Drury Lane. It was here that Ellen Terry first met Henry Irving in a Shakespearean role. There is a plaque to commemorate the theatre, but it has been placed on the wrong block — the theatre was to the east of Endell Street, not the west. On Acre House (No. 69–75) is a green plaque commemorating Denis Johnson's workshop. He lived "c." 1760 to 1833 and had a workshop here in 1819, selling "hobby horse" bicycles, the first to be sold in the United Kingdom.
At No. 132, John Logie Baird made the first British television broadcast in 1929. Just off Long Acre is Langley Street, home of the Pineapple Dance Studios and London Film School, the oldest such school in the world. Just opposite, until 2000, was Paxman, one of the leading English manufacturers of French horns. It is said that the poet Richard Lovelace spent his final years in Long Acre, in great poverty. As a young man, Thomas Paine worked as a corset maker in Long Acre. In 1896, the Freemason's Arms was built; it still stands on Long Acre. Masonic symbols adorn the façade.
Geography.
Long Acre is numbered 1 to 77 on the south side and 78 to 144 on the north side. At No. 10–12 is Stanfords, one of the oldest and most extensive map shops in the United Kingdom. At the junction with James Street is Covent Garden tube station.
Long Acre ends in the east at a junction with Drury Lane. Overlooking this junction is Freemasons' Hall, the headquarters of the British Freemasons, on Great Queen Street.

Green Corn Ceremony

The Green Corn Ceremony is a religious and social event celebrated by a number of American Indian peoples of the Eastern Woodlands and the Southeastern tribes. The Green Corn festivals were also practiced by the Mississippian culture people as part of their Mississippian Ideological Interaction Sphere. 
Green Corn festivals are held today by many different Southeastern Woodland tribes. The Green Corn Ceremony typically coincides in the late summer and is tied to the ripening of the corn crops. The ceremony is marked with dancing, feasting, fasting and religious observations.
Ceremony.
The Muscogee tradition.
In the Muscogee tradition of the Southeastern Muscogee Creek people Muscogee Creek and Seminole peoples, the Green Corn festival is called Posketv (Bus-get-uh) which means Fasting to Fast. This ceremony is celebrated as the new year of the Stomp dance society and takes place on the central ceremonial Square Ground which is an elevated square platform with the flat edges of the square facing the cardinal directions. Arbors are constructed upon the flat edges of the square in which the men sit facing one of the four directions. This is encircled by a ring-mound of earth outside of which are constructed the clan houses. In the center of this is the ceremonial fire, which is referred to by many names including 'Grandfather' fire. Ceremonially, this fire is the focus of the songs and prayers of the people and is considered to be a living sacred being who transmits our prayers to Hsaketumese (The Breath Maker). The whole general ceremony centers on the relighting of this ceremonial fire.
The Posketv is the Creek and Seminole New Year. At this time all offenses are forgiven save for rape and murder which were executable or banishable offenses. Historically nearly everything would be torn down and replaced within the tribal town. In modern tribal towns and Stomp Dance societies only the ceremonial fire, the cook fires and certain other ceremonial objects will be replaced. Everyone usually begins gathering by the weekend prior to the Posketv, working, praying, dancing and fasting off and on until the big day.
The first day of the Posketv is the Ribbon or "Ladies" Dance in which the women of the community perform a purifying dance to prepare the ceremonial ground for the renewal ceremony. Following this there is a family meal and by midnight all the men of the community begin fasting. The men sleep right outside the ceremonial square to guard it from intruders. 
The men rise before dawn on the second day and remove the previous year’s fire and clean the ceremonial area from all coals and ash. There are numerous dances and rites that are performed throughout the day as the men continue to fast in the hot southern summer. During this time the women clean out their cook-fires as the central ceremonial fire is relit and nurtured with a special medicine made by the Hillis Hiya. Many Creeks still practice the sapi or ceremonial scratches, a type of bloodletting in the mid afternoon. Then the head woman of each family camp comes to the ceremonial circle where they are handed some hot coals from the newly established ceremonial fire, which they take back to their camp and start their cook fires. 
During this time, men who have earned the right to a war-name are named and the Feather Dance is performed. This dance is a blessing of the area and a rite of passage for youths becoming men. It consists of 16 different performances including a display of war-party tactics and virility.
The fasting usually ends by supper-time after the word is given by the women that the food is prepared, at which time the men march in single-file formation down to a body of water, typically a flowing creek or river for a ceremonial dip in the water and private men’s meeting. They then return to the ceremonial square and perform a single Stomp Dance before retiring to their home camps for a feast. During this time, the participants in the medicine rites are not allowed to sleep, as part of their fast. At midnight a Stomp Dance ceremony is held, which includes fasting and continues on through the night. This ceremony usually ends shortly after dawn, part the participants in the previous day’s rites do not sleep till mid-day.
Posketv the "Ceremonial Fast," commonly referred to as “Green Corn” in English is the central and most festive holiday of the traditional Muskogee people. It represents not only the renewal of the annual cycle, but of the community’s social and spiritual life as a whole. This is symbolically associated with the return of summer and the ripening of the new corn.

Panic! at the Disco

Panic! at the Disco (formerly stylized Panic at the Disco) is an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2004. Since its inception, the band's line-up has included Brendon Urie (lead vocals, guitar, piano) and Spencer Smith (drums), and as of 2010, bass guitarist Dallon Weekes. 
Founded by childhood friends, Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith, Brent Wilson and Brendon Urie, Panic! at the Disco recorded its first demos while its members were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released its debut studio album, "A Fever You Can't Sweat Out" (2005). Made known by the top ten lead single, "I Write Sins Not Tragedies", the album eventually was certified double platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour, and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker.
Influenced by 1960s rock bands, The Beatles, The Zombies and The Beach Boys, and preceded by the hit single, "Nine in the Afternoon", the band's second studio album, "Pretty. Odd." (2008), marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut, and ultimately led to the departure of guitarist and principal songwriter Ryan Ross and bassist Jon Walker, who favored the band's new direction. The duo subsequently formed a new band, The Young Veins, leaving Brendon Urie and Spencer Smith as the sole remaining members of Panic! at the Disco.
Continuing as a duo, the band released a new single, "New Perspective", and recruited Dallon Weekes (bass) and Ian Crawford (guitar) to accompany the band during live performances. The band's third studio album, "Vices & Virtues" (2011), marked a return to the band's initial Vaudevillian pop-punk sound and was recorded solely by Urie and Spencer with producers John Feldmann and Butch Walker.
In 2012, the band added touring bassist Weekes to its core line-up, rendering the band a three-piece, and released its fourth studio album, "Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!", in 2013.
On April 28, 2014, the band announced a 'Nicotine EP' with a release date of May 6, 2014. The EP will include 2 previously unreleased songs.
History.
Formation and early years (2004–05).
Panic! at the Disco was formed in 2004 in the suburban area of Summerlin, Las Vegas, by childhood friends Ryan Ross, who sang and played guitar, and Spencer Smith, who played drums. They both attended Bishop Gorman High School, and they began playing music together in ninth grade. They invited friend Brent Wilson from nearby Palo Verde High School to join on bass, and Wilson invited classmate Brendon Urie to try out on guitar. The quartet soon began rehearsing in Smith's grandmother's living room. Urie grew up in a Mormon family in Las Vegas and early on skipped rehearsals to go to church. Ross initially was the lead vocalist for the group, but after hearing Urie sing back-up during rehearsals, the group decided to make him the lead. Initially, Panic! at the Disco was just a blink-182 cover band.
The monotonous nature of local Las Vegas bands influenced the members of the band to be different and creative, and they soon began laying down experimental demos. The band had not even performed a single live show when they were signed. "We never went out and played shows before we got signed because the music scene in Las Vegas is so bad. There's not a lot going on," Smith said. "In our practice space, there were something like 30 bands, and every day we'd walk into that room and hear the exact same death-metal bands. So it kind of influenced us to be different. And to get out of Las Vegas." Urie began working at Tropical Smoothie Cafe in Summerlin to afford rent for the band's new practice space. The four left their educations behind to concentrate on music; Ross had a falling out with his father when he dropped out of college, and when Brendon Urie dropped out of high school his parents kicked him out of the house. He stayed with friends until he could afford to rent an apartment.
Ross and Urie soon began to commit to their laptops the demos they had been developing, and posted three early demos ("Time to Dance," "Nails for Breakfast, Tacks for Snacks" and "Camisado") on PureVolume. On a whim, they sent a link to Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz via a LiveJournal account. Wentz, who was in Los Angeles at the time with the rest of Fall Out Boy working on their major-label debut, "From Under the Cork Tree", drove down to Las Vegas to meet with the young, unsigned band. Upon hearing "two to three" songs during band practice, Wentz was impressed and immediately wanted the band to sign to his Fueled by Ramen imprint label Decaydance Records, which made them the first on the new label. Around December 2004, the group signed to the label. As news broke that Wentz had signed Panic! (who had yet to perform a single live show), fans on the Internet began to bash the group. "Almost right away we knew what was going to happen," Ross explained in a 2006 interview. "We had two songs online and people were already making assumptions on what kind of band we were and what we were going to sound like."
Meanwhile, Wentz began to hype the band wherever possible: from wearing "Pete! at the Disco" T-shirts onstage to mentioning them in interviews. Wentz gave a quick shout-out to the band during a press junket on the day before the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards: "I've got a couple of bands coming out soon on Decaydance, one being this band called Panic! at the Disco," Wentz said. "Their record is going to be your next favorite record. It's called "A Fever You Can't Sweat Out" – get it before your little brother does." At the time of their signing, all of the band members were still in high school (with the exception of Ross, who was forced to quit UNLV). Urie graduated in May 2005 and Wilson and Smith finished school online as the band left for College Park, Maryland to record their debut record.
"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out" (2005–07).
The band relocated to College Park, Maryland, to record their debut album from June to September 2005. Although they only had shells of songs when they arrived, the rest of the album shaped up fast through the marathon session. "We didn't have a day off in the five-and-a-half weeks we were there, 12 or 14 hours a day," Ross said in a 2005 interview. "We were making things up in our heads that weren't there, and on top of the stress of trying to finish the record, we were living in a one-bedroom apartment with four people on bunk beds," recalled Ross. "Everyone got on everybody's nerves. Someone would write a new part for a song and someone else would say they didn't like it just because you ate their cereal that morning."
The album is split into two halves: the first half is mostly electronic dance punk, while the second half features Vaudevillian piano, strings, and accordion. The band grew tired of writing only with drum machines and keyboards and, inspired by film scores (specifically the works of Danny Elfman and Jon Brion) decided to write a completely different half. "By the end of that, we were completely exhausted," said Ross of the studio sessions. After its completion, "we had two weeks to come home and learn how to be a band," Ross said. The group played their first live show during the summer of 2005 at local Las Vegas music venue The Alley on West Charleston. Afterwards, the band toured nationally on the Nintendo Fusion Tour with mentors Fall Out Boy, as well as Motion City Soundtrack, The Starting Line, and Boys Night Out for the rest of 2005.
Their debut album, "A Fever You Can't Sweat Out", was released September 27, 2005. Sales began relatively slow. It debuted at No. 112 on the "Billboard" 200 album chart, No. 6 on the "Billboard" Independent Albums chart, and No. 1 on the "Billboard" Top Heatseekers chart, with nearly 10,000 albums sold in the first week of release. Within a span of four months, Panic! would see the video for their first single, "I Write Sins Not Tragedies", rocket up the "Billboard" Hot 100 as sales of "Fever" passed the 500,000 mark. At the end of March 2006, they announced their very own headlining tour. By August, their debut record was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and the music video for "I Write Sins, Not Tragedies" won Video of the Year at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards. "Some aspects of the fame are annoying, but at the end of the day it's something we're most grateful for. It's certainly opened the door to a whole new batch of opportunities," Ross said of the band's newfound fame and instant success.
In May 2006, Panic! at the Disco announced that original bassist Brent Wilson had left the band, "posting a statement that was both diplomatic and entirely inscrutable […] yet to mention any reason why Wilson is leaving Panic," according to MTV News. In June, Wilson asserted to MTV News that he was kicked out of the band via a phone call. "It was done as a phone call and the only person who spoke was Spencer. Apparently Brendon and Ryan were on the speakerphone too , but they didn't say a word. They never even said they were sorry," explained Wilson. Smith wrote a lengthy e-mail back to James Montgomery of MTV News, stating, in part, "We made the decision based on Brent's lack of responsibility and the fact that he wasn't progressing musically with the band," and revealed that Wilson did not write nor play any bass present on "Fever": Instead, Urie recorded these parts. Wilson demanded a cut in royalties, and threatened to take his former band to court.
The band supported The Academy Is… on their worldwide The Ambitious Ones and Smoking Guns Tour from January to May 2006. Beginning in June, the group headlined their first unnamed national tour, that would last until August. During their performance at the 2006 Reading Festival in August, the band was greeted by excessive bottling, one of which hit Urie in the face that knocked him unconscious. Despite this, the band continued with their set after Urie recovered. The band's second headlining tour, dubbed the Nothing Rhymes with Circus Tour, began in November. In roughly one year, Panic! at the Disco went from being the opening act on a five-band bill to the headliners on a massive arena tour.
The Nothing Rhymes with Circus Tour debuted the band's highly theatrical and notable live show, which featured every song with dance numbers, skits and tricks performed by a six-member troupe, as the band donned intricate costumes, loosely re-enacting moments from the songs. Kelefa Sanneh of "The New York Times" noted the sudden success and circus-inspired tour of the young band in a concert review: "There’s something charming about watching a band trying to navigate sudden success, aided by a contortionist, a ribbon dancer and all the rest of it." MTV News favorably likened its theme and wardrobe to "Janet Jackson's audience-dividing, hypersexual Velvet Rope Tour." The group, fresh off the major success of "A Fever You Can't Sweat Out", took a break after non-stop touring and began formulating ideas for their next record together during the winter of 2006.
"Pretty. Odd." and "...Live in Chicago" (2008).
After a short period of development regarding the ideas of the album, on March 6, 2007 the band arrived at a cabin in the rural mountains of Mount Charleston, Nevada and began the writing process for the new album. After recording the new tracks and performing them live over the summer, the band returned to their native Las Vegas as well as their old rehearsal studio, where they wrote their debut record. The band grew uninterested in the songs previously written and by August scrapped the entire new album (which Ross later revealed was "three-quarters" done) and started over. "We wanted to approach these songs in the most basic form," Ross said. "We wrote them all on one acoustic guitar and with someone singing. I think that we kind of skipped that part of songwriting on the first record, and this time we're sort of paying attention to that. […] We've written a bunch of songs since we've been home Vegas. I think it's the most fun and the happiest we've been since we started." With simplicity the new focus and the old album shelved, the group settled in and began recording what would become "Pretty. Odd." In October, the band entered the Studio at the Palms at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas to begin recording the album.
In January 2008, the band unveiled a new logo and dropped the exclamation point from their name, becoming Panic at the Disco, which soon caused outrage among the band's fanbase. Released on March 21, 2008, "Pretty. Odd." was described by the band as "more organic and mellower" than "A Fever You Can't Sweat Out", as well as unintentionally and coincidentally similar to music of The Beatles, in both songwriting and scope. The record debuted at number two on the US "Billboard" 200 chart, with first-day sales of 54,000, and first-week sales of 139,000 copies in the United States. Those figures marked the band's biggest sales week to that date, beating a previous record held by "A Fever You Can't Sweat Out" (which sold 45,000 during the winter of 2006). The record also debuted at "Current Alternative Albums" chart and No. 2 on the "Digital Albums" chart, the latter of which accounted for 26 percent of the disc's overall sales. The album charted high in various other countries and was eventually certified gold in the United Kingdom, however, "Pretty. Odd." received relatively disappointing sales in the face of its predecessor. "Pretty. Odd." was, however, critically acclaimed in contrast to "Fever": Barry Walters of "Spin" called Panic's debut album "embarrassing" while regarding the new record as " to be optimistically beautiful at a time when sadness and ugliness might have won them easier credibility."
The band announced plans to headline the 2008 Honda Civic Tour in January 2008, which took up the majority of early touring for the album. Motion City Soundtrack, The Hush Sound and Phantom Planet opened for the tour, which April 10 to July 14, 2008 across North America. Throughout October and November 2008, the band toured with Dashboard Confessional and The Cab on the "Rock Band" Live Tour promoting the video game "Rock Band 2".
As expected and predicted by several music publications, the band adopted a very different style for the touring in support of "Pretty. Odd.", in contrast to the dark, circus-themed elements of their previous stage shows. Each show contained "woodsy set pieces, projections of flora and fauna, and mic stands wrapped in lights and flowers," and each band member dressed in a vest. While reflecting on the theatrical nature of "A Fever You Can't Sweat Out" touring, Urie commented "We did it and it was a lot of fun when we did it, but this time around I think we wanted to get back to a more intimate, personal setting, and scale it down a little bit." Ryan Ross explained that "It's more about connecting with the audience and seeing what's gonna happen every night. It's not as scripted out and pre-planned. It makes it more exciting for us, and less monotonous every night." A live album, "...Live in Chicago", based on live recordings from Chicago during the Honda Civic Tour, was released December 2, 2008. An accompanying DVD contains photos from the tour, each music video from the album as well as behind-the-scenes footage of the videos and the tour, the short film "Panic! at the Disco In: American Valley", and the documentary feature based on the tour, "All In A Day's".
"Pretty. Odd." touring was also defined by a larger effort to remain environmentally conscious. On the tour, the band worked with two non-profit eco organizations: Reverb, which facilitates environmentally friendly touring; and Global Inheritance, which seeks to inspire more eco-activism. In a 2008 interview, Ross revealed that the band traveling on a biodiesel bus, to re-using plastics, and recycling more backstage. The band went as far as to print tour booklets on recycled paper, with soy ink, and organize an "eco-contest," in which profits from the tour went straight to environmental organizations.
Lineup change and "Vices & Virtues" (2009–11).
In spring 2009, the band began recording material for their then-untitled third studio album. However, on July 6, 2009, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker announced via the band's official website that the two were leaving the band. In an interview following the split, Ross explained that he first brought the idea to Smith in late June 2009 over lunch: "Spencer and I had lunch and caught up for a while, and then the big question came up, like, 'Well, what do you want to do?' and I said, 'Well, I think it might be best if we kind of do our own thing for a while', and he said, 'I'm glad you said that, because I was going to say the same thing'", Ross recalled. "And there was really no argument, which is really the best way that could've worked out." Ross said the split was largely due to creative differences between him and Urie. Urie wanted the band to explore a more polished pop sound, while Ross – and, by extension, Walker – was interested in making retro-inspired rock.
The news asserted that both tour plans with blink-182 in August 2009 and new album production "will continue as previously announced." The following day, "Alternative Press" broke the news that "New Perspective", the first song recorded without Ross and Walker, would debut the following month on radio and as a part of the soundtrack to the film "Jennifer's Body". On July 10, 2009, "Alternative Press" also reported that the band had regained the exclamation point, becoming, once again, Panic! at the Disco. "New Perspective" was released on July 28, 2009. Former The Cab member Ian Crawford filled in for Ross on their tour during the blink-182 Summer Tour in August 2009, and Dallon Weekes, singer/songwriter of the indie band The Brobecks, filled in for Walker on bass.
The band re-entered the studio during early 2010 and spent much of the year recording their third studio album. On January 18, 2011, the band revealed that their new album, "Vices & Virtues", would officially be released on March 22, 2011. The album was produced by Butch Walker and John Feldmann. The record's first single, "The Ballad of Mona Lisa", was released digitally on February 1, 2011, with the music video being released February 8, 2011. "Vices & Virtues" was officially released March 22, 2011 to relatively positive critical reviews.
The band began touring in support of the album, christened the "Vices & Virtues" Tour, in earnest beginning in February 2011. The tour has sported the same electric, over-the-top theatricality the band was known for during the "Fever" era. "I really miss wearing costumes and makeup," Urie told "Spin". "I love throwing a big production. I've recently been reading about Tesla coils and I'm trying to figure out how I can get one that sits on the stage and shoots sparks without hurting anybody." They were scheduled to play the Australian Soundwave Revolution festival in September/October but the festival was cancelled and in its place is the Counter-Revolution mini-festival the band will play.
On May 12, 2011, the band collaborated with indie pop band Fun. for their US tour, releasing a new single named "C'mon". The group contributed a new song "Mercenary" to for the video game "".
In 2011, Panic! at the Disco played a month-long fall US tour with supporting acts Patrick Stump and Foxy Shazam at club and theatre venues. In January–February 2012, they play a sold-out, 8-date UK tour with support from Australian newcomers ME, during which they announced that they were currently working on a fourth album.
"Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!" (2012–present).
Since the last tour cycle, Urie, Smith, and Weekes, who joined the band as an official member in 2010, have been in the studio writing and preparing for a fourth album. On July 15, 2013, the album was announced as "Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!", with a scheduled release date of October 8, 2013. The first single, "Miss Jackson", was released on July 15, 2013, along with its music video to promote the album. Panic! At The Disco are slated to tour the US and Europe in support of the new album, and are opening for Fall Out Boy on the Save Rock And Roll Arena Tour.
Shortly before the band began their first tour in support of the album, Spencer Smith wrote an open letter to fans regarding his abuse of alcohol and prescription medications since the recording of "Pretty. Odd." Although Smith joined the band for the first handful of dates, he left the tour to "continue fighting addiction." Urie posted on the band's official website that "It's become evident that Spencer still needs more time to take care of himself. I can't expect him to be fighting addiction one minute and be fully immersed in a national tour the next. With that said, the tour will continue without Spencer while he is away getting the help he needs."
Musical style.
Music critics named a number of different genres to describe Panic! at the Disco's music, including emo, pop punk, electro, vaudeville, and baroque pop. These labels were more of a reflection of the band's work on "A Fever You Can't Sweat Out", as the stylistic shift on "Pretty. Odd." made many of these claims insignificant.
Panic! at the Disco went on record many times saying that their second album would be completely different from "A Fever You Can't Sweat Out", as "Rolling Stone" wrote in an article: "The group cemented its next direction with their first single, called "Nine in the Afternoon". "It's influenced by the music our parents listened to: the Beach Boys, The Kinks, the Beatles", says Ross. "Our new songs are more like classic rock than modern rock. We got older and started listening to different music – and this seems like the natural thing to do right now." In his review of their live album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted, "..."Pretty. Odd." suggests that they're becoming that rare thing in 2008: a pop-oriented rock band. They might not be doing this knowingly, but the results are entertaining all the same."
Since the release of "Vices & Virtues", the band's musical sensibilities have returned to the theatrical pop rock of their debut, albeit more mature and restrained in the style of "Pretty. Odd." Urie has gone on record several times claiming that this was not the band's intention, stating that "Virtues" is a rebirth for the band and indicative of a new identity following the departures of Ross and Walker.

Admiral Clarey Bridge

Admiral Clarey Bridge, also known as the Ford Island Bridge, is a pontoon bridge, commonly called a floating concrete drawbridge, providing access to Ford Island, a United States Navy installation situated in the middle of Pearl Harbor. The bridge provides access to Ford Island's historic sites to the public via tour bus and provides access to O'ahu for US military families housed on the island. Before the completion of the bridge, the island's residents were required to use ferry boats operated by Naval personnel that operated on an hourly basis. The bridge is one of only a few floating bridges and its floating moveable span is the largest worldwide. Its namesake, Admiral Bernard A. Clarey, was one of the Navy's most decorated officers.
History.
Prior to the bridge being built, access to Ford Island was provided via ferryboat. Two diesel-powered ferries served the island, "Waa Hele Honoa" (YFB-83) and "Moko Holo Hele" (YFB-87). The "Waa Hele Honoa", translated to "Canoe go to land", was purchased in 1959 for $274,000. Later, the ferry was pressed into service by the Navy on 3 March 1961. It is the older and larger of the two ferries at 181 feet long. It could carry 750 people and 33 vehicles. The other, "Moko Holo Hele", translated to "boat go back and forth", was purchased for $1.1 million on 25 May 1970. It is 162 feet long, but can hold 750 people and 42 vehicles. Both ferries were operated by U.S. Navy personnel. Access to the island was restricted to U.S. military personnel, their dependents, and invited guests. In addition to the two car ferries there were several smaller "foot ferries" that allowed pedestrians to transit between Ford Island and several alternate landings around Pearl Harbor.
Funding.
Proposals to connect the island have been around since 1967. A 1967 study suggested that there were only three ways to connect the island: a bridge, a tunnel, or a rubble-filled causeway. The 1976 military construction budget included a proposal for a $25 million causeway but it was removed from the budget for being too expensive. Other proposals such as a steel bridge were considered but were never constructed because of the cost. Not until Sen. Inouye's special legislation, , to authorize the Navy to sell land to fund the bridge did a real proposal come to fruition. The bridge was primarily funded through the "Manana deal" with Pearl City where the Navy sold , called the Manana storage site, to Pearl City for development for $94,000,000. The Navy was also able to lease and sell of Ford Island as part of Sen. Inouye's renovation project to use private funds to redevelop the island.
Rebirth of Ford Island.
Initially termed "the bridge to nowhere", the Admiral Clarey bridge was instrumental in Senator Daniel Inouye's "rebirth" of Ford Island and enabled over $500,000,000 in development on the island. It connected 45 families and 3,000 civilian workers to Kamehameha Highway. The completion of the bridge also enabled the Navy to further develop the island to include the $331,000,000 NOAA's Senator Daniel Inouye Pacific Tsunami warning center. In addition, visitor access to the island with the bridge enabled the construction of the $50,000,000 Pacific Aviation Museum.
It was designed by Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade & Douglas, Inc and constructed by the joint venture of Dillingham-Manson. Ground was broken on the causeway bridge on 10 January 1996 and was completed in 1998 and dedicated on 15 April of that year. The entire project cost $78,000,000 to complete. The design of the bridge earned the 1999 American Society of Civil Engineers Outstanding Projects and leaders award of merit and the United States Department of Transportation 2000 Honor Award for design excellence. The project was completed ahead of time and under budget.
Future plans for the bridge include a plan by the city of Honolulu to build a second bridge from Ford Island to 'Ewa Beach to reduce the stress on existing highways caused by high traffic and congestion. Currently, Interstate H-1 provides the only access from the west side of the island to Honolulu. The plan would include a public use or toll roadway that would come near the Navy's West Loch Naval Magazine, which stores ammunition for the military; a concern for the Navy. The Navy also expressed concerns about the infrastructure of Pearl Harbor and Ford Island's historical significance being affected by the project.
Design.
The bridge has a total length of , including a pontoon section that can be retracted under the fixed bridge to allow the largest battleships and aircraft carriers to pass. The bridge consists of a wide channel as well as a wide high opening for smaller craft under an elevated span. The entry control point at the east end of the bridge provides room for two traffic lanes of entry, a single exit lane, and a guard tower with a turnaround.
Design–build.
The project was developed using a design–build, operate and maintain (DBOM) approach. The Navy did pre-planning and conducted an environmental impact statement and studied various bridge alternatives and had already settled on a combination fixed and floating bridge. The Navy then awarded contracts of $350,000 to three major contractors to solicit designs for the bridge. On 19 August 1994 the Navy awarded a design-build contract to Dillingham-Manson, JV.
Construction.
350 to 400 24-inch prestressed concrete piles were used to support the bridge and constructed on site. The piles were driven at angles into the seabed. In 2001, three years after construction had completed, cracks were discovered in four pillars. Under a maintenance contract, the cracks were repaired with concrete sleeves at no cost to the Navy.
The majority of the pre-cast girders and deck panels were constructed in Tacoma, Washington and shipped by barge. The three concrete pontoons for the floating moveable span were also constructed in Tacoma by Concrete Technology Corporation in a graving dock and floated to Ford Island by barge in three shipments. They are long, wide, and tall, and contain 21 water-tight air-filled cells with leak detectors to provide buoyancy. The three sections were assembled at the site using large steel bolts.
Because of the vulnerability of pontoon bridges, as they rest on water, they have to be designed to withstand not only stresses from traffic but from nature as well. A similar bridge in Washington, the Hood Canal bridge, sank in 1979 after flooding of the pontoons due to winds. Experience from the replacement for that bridge helped engineers better design the pontoons for wave load resistance for the Admiral Clarey bridge. The Admiral Clarey bridge was designed to withstand winds as high as and waves as high as .
Moveable span.
The bridge was designed with a movable floating pontoon. Steel transition spans connect the two ends of the fixed bridge to the pontoon. Two hydraulic rams, located on either side of the transition spans, lift the transition spans off the pontoon allowing the pontoon to retract under the fixed bridge. The transition spans accommodate of tide movement and of pontoon movement. In addition, the spans sit on a central pivot that assists with the movement caused by waves. In the event that the transition spans are unable to bear the stress of movement of the pontoon, specifically in the case of seismic activity, the bridge has a breakaway feature that can be easily repaired.
The floating portion is then retracted under the O'ahu side of the fixed bridge at a rate of 14 inches per second to create a 650 ft navigation channel. The entire process takes 25 minutes to complete. Retraction of the movable span is accomplished by two hydraulic winches located on the control pier on the southeast side of the bridge. Two-inch steel cables are used to connect each winch to the pontoon: one is connected to the far and the other to the near end of the pontoon. The opening sequence consists of activating the warning lights and bells, lowering the warning gates and barriers, lifting the transition spans on both sides, and operating the winches. During the opening, winch connected to the west end pulls while the winch on the east end pays out. As the span nears fully open, the winch speeds are slowed to allow the pontoon to stop without snapping a cable. This entire operation is operated from a control room on the east section of the bridge at the highest point and monitored from wireless cameras. 36 post-tensioned straddle bents span 60-ft under the elevated span to form a pocket for the movable span to rest while the bridge is open.
Public reception.
Although access to the bridge is limited to those who hold a US military ID card, several events are hosted annually that are open to the public. The bridge is the location of the annual Ford Island 10K Bridge run which has been one of the largest runs in O'ahu. Starting in 2012, the Tripler Fisher House started its "Boots on the Bridge" event which honors fallen military members by placing boots with photos across Ford Island and the Admiral Clarey Bridge. More than 6,000 boots line the route to remember each fallen soldier since the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York City. In 2009, the American Cancer Society raised over $150,000 from 3,000 participating for breast cancer research through the Making Strides Against Breast Cancer walk over the bridge and in 2011 had over 8,000 participants and raised over $200,000.
National Park Service officials criticized the construction of the Admiral Clarey bridge fearing that by connecting road traffic to the mainland, the increased flow of island visitors would raise the level of theft of historical artifacts from the USS "Arizona" and other memorials on or around Ford Island.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which has a facility on Ford Island, criticized the US Navy's hurricane and tsunami disaster plans which calls for closing the bridge to traffic and opening the channel to allow all ships to vacate the harbor. The NOAA's concerns were that with the bridge outage, the tsunami warning center would not be able to operate effectively at a time when its need was greatest. The Navy's plan calls for the use of the tour boats to act as ferries whenever the bridge would be unavailable for long periods of time and offered them as a solution to the NOAA's concerns. However, an organization called Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) believed that the boats would be unable to provide for a speedy evacuation in a Tsunami. In the event of a storm, PEER also noted that if the Navy was so concerned that they would evacuate their largest ships, that the small ferries would be unable to operate in those storm conditions. If the ferries were unable to operate, NOAA employees could not rotate shifts with fresh staff to relieve stranded employees sheltering in place. The NOAA assured its employees that a Tsunami affecting Ford Island was unlikely despite that O'ahu is an area of high tsunami danger.
Namesake.
The Admiral Clarey bridge was named after United States Navy Admiral Bernard A. Clarey. Admiral Clarey served as Commander U.S. Second Fleet (COMSECONDFLT) and later was Commander U.S. Pacific Fleet. He was awarded three Navy Crosses for valor. Admiral Clarey is a survivor of the attack on Pearl Harbor while he was the executive officer of the submarine "Dolphin" (SS-169). After his service in the Navy, Clarey served as vice president for the Bank of Hawaii. He died at Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii on 15 June 1996.
Memorials.
The submarine lies just south of the sentry tower. Visible from the Admiral Clarey bridge, also to the south but on the Ford Island side, are the USS "Arizona" Memorial and . While ferry boats still provide access to the USS "Arizona" memorial, the bridge is the only access to the "Missouri" tour, the USS "Oklahoma" memorial, the Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor, and for the public via Roberts Hawaii tour bus.
The Navy Facilities Engineering Command required that the bridge be low-profile to prevent any visual degradation to the USS "Arizona" memorial and to maintain Ford Island's historical and cultural value.

Naval ranks of the Japanese Empire during World War II

The following graphs present the rank insignia of the Japanese navy during World War II. These designs had been used from 1931-1945, but were discontinued after World War II, when the Imperial Japanese Navy was dissolved.
The same officer ranks were used for both the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy, the only distinction being the placement of the word "Rikugun" (Army) or "Kaigun" (Navy) before the rank. Thus, for example, a Captain in the navy shared the same rank designation as that of a Colonel in the Army-"Taisa" (Colonel), so the rank of ""Rikugun Taisa"" denoted an Army Colonel while the rank of ""Kaigun Daisa"" denoted a Naval Captain.
Enlisted ranks.
All warrant and commissioned officer ranks had the same names as their army counterparts. For non-commissioned officers and enlisted, the naming changed in 1942. The first name is before, the second after that date. Both of them were different from the army names, but were equal in rank.

Jane Pope

Jane Pope (1744 – 30 July 1818) was an English actress, daughter of a London theatrical wig-maker. (There has been confusion over her date of birth with different authorities giving 1742 and 1744, but in a letter from Jane Pope of 1808 she states her age as 64.) She began playing in a Lilliputian company for Garrick in 1756. From this she speedily developed into soubrette roles. She was Mrs Candour in "The School for Scandal" at its first presentation (1777), and thereafter she had many important parts given to her. She was the lifelong friend of Mrs Clive, and erected the monument at Twickenham to the latter's memory. She retired from the professional stage at a special performance at Drury Lane on 26 May 1808. She was an admirable actress and was praised by all the literary critics of her day unused to such a combination.

Rixton Clay Pits (also known as Rixton Claypits) is a former clay extraction site in Rixton, near Hollins Green, Warrington, England. Formerly farmland, boulder clay extraction started in the 1920s for brick making in the adjacent brickworks, and ceased in 1965 - since when it has been allowed to return to nature. It is now an area of ponds, scrub, woodland and damp grassland. It is owned and managed by Warrington Borough Council as a local amenity.
Two large sections of Rixton Clay Pits, in total, are a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a designated Special Area of Conservation, on account of its calcareous grassland communities and because it supports the largest breeding population of Great Crested Newts in Cheshire. The whole was established as a local nature reserve in 1996, and has waymarked paths and a visitor centre.
Fishing is permitted on the lake between the two sections of SSSI, and is controlled by the Warrington Anglers Association, the main stock being tench, bream and roach. Carp and pike are also present.

<doc id="2893299" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2893299" title="Foreign exchange swap">
Foreign exchange swap

In finance, a foreign exchange swap, forex swap, or FX swap is a simultaneous purchase and sale of identical amounts of one currency for another with two different value dates (normally spot to forward). see Foreign exchange derivative. Foreign Exchange Swap allows sums of a certain currency to be used to fund charges designated in another currency without acquiring foreign exchange risk. It permits companies that have funds in different currencies to manage them efficiently.
swap contract: swap contract is an agreement between two party to exchange a cash flow in one currency against a cash flow in another currency according to predetermine terms & conditions.
Structure.
A foreign exchange swap consists of two legs:
These two legs are executed simultaneously for the same quantity, and therefore offset each other.
Forward foreign exchange transactions occur if both companies have a currency the other needs. It prevents negative foreign exchange risk for either party. Foreign exchange spot transactions are similar to forward foreign exchange transactions in terms of how they are agreed upon; however, they are planned for a specific date in the very near future, usually within the same week.
It is also common to trade "forward-forward", where both transactions are for (different) forward dates.
Uses.
The most common use of foreign exchange swaps is for institutions to fund their foreign exchange balances.
Once a foreign exchange transaction settles, the holder is left with a positive (or "long") position in one currency, and a negative (or "short") position in another. In order to collect or pay any overnight interest due on these foreign balances, at the end of every day institutions will close out any foreign balances and re-institute them for the following day. To do this they typically use "tom-next" swaps, buying (or selling) a foreign amount settling tomorrow, and then doing the opposite, selling (or buying) it back settling the day after.
The interest collected or paid every night is referred to as the cost of carry. As currency traders know roughly how much holding a currency position will make or cost on a daily basis, specific trades are put on based on this; these are referred to as carry trades.
Companies may also use them to avoid foreign exchange risk.
Example:
Pricing.
The relationship between spot and forward is known as the interest rate parity, which states that
where
The forward points or swap points are quoted as the difference between forward and spot, "F" - "S", and is expressed as the following:
if formula_3 is small. Thus, the value of the swap points is roughly proportional to the interest rate differential.
Related instruments.
A foreign exchange swap should not be confused with a currency swap, which is a much rarer, long term transaction, governed by a slightly different set of rules.

<doc id="2893300" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2893300" title="Horizontal scan rate">
Horizontal scan rate

Horizontal scan rate, or horizontal frequency, usually expressed in kilohertz, is the frequency at which a CRT moves the electron beam from the left side of the display to the right and back, and therefore describes the number of horizontal lines displayed per second. CRT timings actually include some horizontal scans before the visible display, after it, and during the travel from bottom to top (known as vertical back porch, vertical front porch, and vertical sync width, respectively, and collectively known as vertical blank time), so the horizontal scan rate does not directly correlate to visible display lines, unless the unseen lines are also known, but it can still be used to approximate the display lines, as the total blank time is usually a small but significant portion of the total lines.
It is usually the most limiting factor of a CRT display. This limit is due to how quickly the CRT's yoke can move the electron beam from one side of the display to the other.
Compare vertical scan rate (refresh rate), which indicates how often the electron beam is moved from the bottom of the display to the top. Given the horizontal scan rate, the refresh rate can be approximated by dividing the horizontal scan rate by the number of horizontal lines multiplied by 1.05 (since about 5% of the time it takes to scan the screen is spent moving the electron beam back to the top). For instance, a monitor with a horizontal scanning frequency of 96 kHz at a resolution of 1280 x 1024 has a refresh rate of 96,000 / (1024 x 1.05) ≈ 89 Hz (rounded down).

St Cuthbert's High School

St. Cuthbert's Catholic High School is a boys-only Roman Catholic secondary school with academy status located in the Benwell Hill area of Newcastle upon Tyne, England.
Admissions.
St Cuthbert's is a seven form entry school. The School has a series of pre-entry tests, called CATS, the results of which help to decide which class a boy will be placed into. The school admits students of all faiths although it is a Roman Catholic school.
History.
Grammar school.
St. Cuthbert's Grammar School was opened in Westmorland Road, Elswick on 16 August 1881 largely due to the efforts of Bishop James Chadwick and his successor Bishop Bewick building upon the foundations of the Catholic Collegiate School established in 1870 in Eldon Square. Shortly afterward the School moved to larger premises in Bath Lane in the centre of the city. In 1922 the School transferred to the present site on Benwell Hill. Part of the school (1922 Block – now demolished) is built directly over the Vallum of Hadrian's Wall. During the war, boys were evacuated to Cockermouth in what is now Cumbria. In 2011 the School again became single site on the completion of the BSF building Phase, the former Lower School buildings on Fox & Hounds Lane have now been demolished.
It was a direct grant grammar school until September 1977, then began to take a comprehensive intake.

Original Harmony Ridge Creekdippers

The Original Harmony Ridge Creekdippers are an Americana group formed by songwriter Mark Olson and his wife Victoria Williams after Olson left his previous band The Jayhawks. The group has also been called Rolling Creekdippers as well as just Creekdippers.
For their first three albums, the band consisted mostly of Olson, Williams and multi-instrumentalist Mike "Razz" Russell with a little help from drummers Don Heffington and John Convertino. These were all recorded at the couple's home in Joshua Tree, California and were distributed by mail order with very little touring to support them.
In 2000 the group picked up touring multi-instrumentalists Joshua Grange and David Wolfenberger as well as long time Creekdipper "Razz" Russell, dropped "Original Harmony Ridge" from the name and began a constant two continent touring schedule in support of three full band recordings; "My Own Jo Ellen", "December's Child" and "Mystic Theatre", which featured the touring quintet along with Greg Leisz, Danny Frankel, Don Heffington, Jon Birdsong and most notably a reunion duet of Olson and former Jayhawks bandmate Gary Louris on "December's Child".
Olson and The Creekdippers have toured in several different combinations without Williams, Grange and Wolfenberger but with drummer Ray Woods and Russell. In 2004 Olson and Louris reunited for a tour with Woods and Russell.

Manuel Joël

Manuel Joël (or "Joel"; October 19, 1826 – November 3, 1890) was a German Jewish philosopher and preacher.
He was born in Birnbaum (Międzychód), Grand Duchy of Posen. After teaching for several years at the Breslau rabbinical seminary, founded by Zecharias Frankel, he became the successor of Abraham Geiger in the rabbinate of Breslau. He made important contributions to the history of the school of Aqiba as well as to the history of Jewish philosophy, his essays on Ibn Gabirol and Maimonides being of permanent worth. But his most influential work was connected with the relations between Jewish philosophy and the medieval scholasticism. He showed how Albertus Magnus derived some of his ideas from Maimonides and how Spinoza was indebted to the same writer, as well as to Hasdai Crescas. These essays were collected in two volumes of "Beiträge zur Geschichte der Philosophie" (1876), while another two volumes of "Blicke in die Religionsgeschichte" (1880-1883) threw much light on the development of religious thought in the early centuries of the Christian era. Equally renowned were Joel's pulpit addresses. Though he was no orator, his appeal to the reason was effective, and in their published form his three volumes of Predigten (issued posthumously) found many readers.
Joël died in 1890 in Breslau.

Dallas Drake

Dallas James Drake (born February 4, 1969) is a retired Canadian professional ice hockey winger in the National Hockey League who last played for the Detroit Red Wings. Previously, Drake played for the Winnipeg Jets/Phoenix Coyotes, and St. Louis Blues. Drake played his college hockey at Northern Michigan University.
Playing career.
Dallas Drake was drafted by the Detroit Red Wings in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft in the 6th round, 116th overall. During his junior year at Northern Michigan, he was a key factor in the team winning the 1991 NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship. In the final game, NMU teammate Darryl Plandowski scored the winning goal as the Wildcats defeated Boston University 8–7 in triple overtime. Following a stellar four-year college career, Drake made the Red Wings roster out of training camp without playing in the minor leagues. He enjoyed a fine rookie season in 1992–93, posting 44 points on 18 goals and 26 assists. The following season he was part of a trade that saw him shipped to the Winnipeg Jets along with goaltender Tim Cheveldae. The Red Wings received goaltender Bob Essensa and defenceman Sergei Bautin in return. The trade was generally a wash for the Wings, as Essensa appeared in only 13 games and was not a factor in the playoffs. Drake went on to have a successful role on the checking lines and penalty kill units of the Winnipeg/Phoenix Coyotes organization.
While on the Phoenix Coyotes, the Phoenix-area band, Stone Bogart, wrote and recorded the song "Dallas Drake", depicting many great moments by the player and clipping various radio broadcasts. The song was used on ESPN and ABC broadcasts of NHL games for the few years following the song's release.
Drake has become known as a tenacious skater and a tough customer in the corners. Although as a pro, he's never been the goal scorer he was in college, his knowledge of the game, leadership and fierce competitiveness allowed him to skate in 1009 NHL games. Since 1992, he was sent to the minor leagues only once. In the 1993–1994 season, Drake skated one game in Adirondack on a rehab assignment, scoring two goals before returning to Detroit the following day and finishing with 10 goals and 22 assists.
Drake signed with the St. Louis Blues for the 2000–01 season, and remained with the organization for six seasons. He achieved his career high in goals with 20 during the 2002–03 season, and was named captain for the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons.
Drake was placed on waivers by the Blues on June 26, 2007 with the purpose of buying out his contract. On July 9, 2007, he was signed as an unrestricted free agent by the Detroit Red Wings to a one-year, $550,000 contract. He had considered ending his professional career with other NHL teams, but chose to return to Detroit in hopes of winning a Stanley Cup with the club that had drafted him over 16 years prior. On June 4, 2008 those dreams were realized when Detroit defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins to win their 11th franchise Stanley Cup championship. During the on ice post-game celebrations Detroit captain Nicklas Lidström passed the Stanley Cup to Drake first.
On July 15, 2008 Drake announced his retirement from the NHL. Coach Mike Babcock recently was quoted saying, "The thing that stands out in my mind is he's a family man; he was totally committed to our team. He drove us with his passion his physicallity. He was a true professional, and the guys wanted to win for him. You can never replace the will of a quality, quality man and quality veteran."
Personal.
Drake lives with his family in Traverse City, Michigan and still spends time in Marquette, Michigan. He has four children, Jakson, Delaney, Darby, and Dysen. Both Jakson and Delaney play youth hockey in Traverse City. Dallas Drake coaches Delaney's hockey team.

Wilcox Park

Wilcox Park (14 acres) is a park and arboretum located at 71 ½ High Street, Westerly, Rhode Island. It is open to the public at all times, without fee, and has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1973 as Wilcox Park Historic District. The historic district includes 84 houses/buildings of the neighborhood surrounding the park covering a area, including the main post office and public library of the town of Westerly.
Wilcox Park, and the Romanesque Westerly Public Library and Memorial at its edge, were the 1898 bequest of Harriet Wilcox, widow of Stephen Wilcox. The latter invented the non-explosive boiler and founded, along with fellow West'lyan Herman Babcock, the giant engineering firm of Babcock & Wilcox.
Wilcox Park was designed in 1898 by Warren H. Manning, an associate of Frederick Law Olmsted, and originally dominated by plants native to the region. However in the 1960s efforts began to develop the park as an arboretum. Current specialties include a dwarf conifer garden, herb garden, garden of the senses, and perennial garden, set off by fine Westerly granite masonry designed by landscape architect Arthur Shurcliff in 1929-1930.
The park contains a number of monuments and memorials including the Wilcox Memorial Fountain (1930), designed by John Francis Paramino and given in honor of Harriet and Stephen Wilcox. One tree was planted in memory of boxing champion Rocky Marciano.
Today, Wilcox Park is privately operated by the Westerly Public Library's Board of Trustees. Both paid and unpaid staff are responsible for the upkeep of the grounds. In 2006 the board announced a plan to restore the park's original character by replacing the many walkways and the aging path lights.
The park is the location of the Summer Pops by the Chorus of Westerly (since 1980) and the Shakespeare in the Park productions by the Colonial Theatre.

Old Synagogue, Essen

The Old Synagogue () is a cultural meeting center and memorial in the city of Essen in West Germany. It is located in the center of the city on Steeler Straße 29, close to the present city hall.
The memorial center was founded in 1980 and is accommodated in the pre-war Jewish community's synagogue. The synagogue, together with the attached "Rabbinerhaus" (House of the Rabbi), which today houses the archives of the city of Essen, was finished after a two-year construction period in 1913. It was originally consecrated as the "Neue Synagoge" (New Synagogue). Today the building is one of the largest, best preserved and architecturally most impressive testimonies to Jewish culture in pre-war Germany.
History of the building.
The Essen synagogue was the cultural and social center of the Jewish community. In 1933 it claimed approximately 5,000 members. It served this function until the so-called "Reichspogromnacht" (also known as "Kristallnacht") of 9–10 November 1938, when it was severely damaged on the inside by plundering, though the exterior remained nearly intact. Although Essen itself was very heavily bombed (see Bombing of Essen in World War II), the building itself managed to survive the Second World War without further damage.
From 1945-1959 the former synagogue stood unused as ruin at the edge of the Essen city center. In 1959, the surviving Jewish community, after it had been using Rabbinerhaus as their center, built a new, much smaller synagogue, which is the current place of worship. In the same year, the city of Essen acquired the former synagogue and in the following years of 1960/1961 renovated it into a museum for industrial design, the "Haus Industrieform". For this purpose, all existing elements were removed or painted over. The ark for the torah was destroyed; the mosaics and ornaments were painted over. Following the spirit of the time, the inside was completely redesigned to a much more sober form to fit the purpose, no longer showing its former use as a synagogue. The main prayer hall was divided by a new floor and the ceiling was covered up.
A fire, caused by a short-circuit, severely damaged the Design exhibition in 1979. This event and a changed attitude toward handling historic buildings finally caused the city council of Essen to found the current institution Alte Synagoge. From 1986-1988 the entire building, with financial means provided by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, was reconstructed, so that it is again recognizable in its earlier function.
Today.
Today the "Alte Synagoge" is an open house for meetings and discussions. It offers a meeting-place for those interested in Jewish culture and religion, past and present. Cultural events such as concerts, plays, and readings are also offered.

All My Love (Led Zeppelin song)

"All My Love" is the sixth track on Led Zeppelin's 1979 album, "In Through the Out Door". Credited to Robert Plant and John Paul Jones, it is a slow-tempo song that features a synthesizer solo by Jones. It was written in honour of Plant's son Karac, who died while Led Zeppelin were on their 1977 North American tour.
Overview.
The original working title for the song's composition was called "The Hook".
"All My Love" was recorded between November and December 1978 at Polar Studios, located in Stockholm, Sweden. A studio outtake of an extended version of the song exists, timed around 7:55 (the song itself would be timed around 6:57). It has a complete ending, with Plant extending the last chorus with much ad-libbing and a twangy B-Bender guitar solo by Page. This version has been made available on a number of Led Zeppelin bootleg recordings.
The song was played live on Led Zeppelin's concert tour of Europe in 1980. It was one of the most well received performances of the tour. "All My Love" is also included on the Led Zeppelin compilations "Early Days and Latter Days", "Remasters" and "Mothership".
In an interview he later gave to rock journalist Cameron Crowe, Plant stated that this song was one of Led Zeppelin's "finest moments". However, guitarist Jimmy Page has expressed less fond sentiments for the song. In an interview with "Guitar World" magazine in 1998, Page stated that he and drummer John Bonham
"All My Love" is one of only two Led Zeppelin songs which Page had no part in writing (the other being "South Bound Saurez", also from "In Through the Out Door").
It is also the only track in the band's catalogue to feature a nylon-stringed classical guitar part.

Delta Aurigae

Delta Aurigae (δ Aur, δ Aurigae) is the Bayer designation for an astrometric binary star in the constellation Auriga. It is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 3.715. Based upon its annual parallax shift of 25.88 mas, it is some distant from the Earth, give or take an eight light-year margin of error. This star is the namesake for the Delta Aurigids, a meteor shower that occurs between October 6–15. The radiant point for this shower passes several degrees to the south of the star.
The visible component of this system is a giant star with a stellar classification of K0 III. It has 11 times the radius of the Sun and shines with 62 times the Sun's luminosity. This energy is being radiated from the star's outer envelope at an effective temperature of 4,786 K. This heat gives the star the orange-hued glow of a K-type star.

David Wolfenberger

David Wolfenberger (born April 19, 1969 in Tuscola, Illinois) is a singer-songwriter from Cincinnati, Ohio. Former frontman for The Marshwiggles and Thom Scarecrow, Wolfenberger has three solo CDs to date; "Tales From Thom Scarecrow", and "World of the Satisfy'n Place" on Blue Jordan Records and more recently in 2006 on Fundamental Records, "Portrait of Narcissus". Wolfenberger also toured and recorded as a member of Mark Olson and Victoria Williams' Original Harmony Ridge Creekdippers. Wolfenberger occasionally records under the pseudonym Sunrise for Someone.
Biography.
Dave Wolfenberger was part of a band called Selah while a History student at the University of Cincinnati in the early 1990s. This band was later renamed The Remnant due to another band having the same name. They played monthly concerts at a local church. One of their songs, "I Am Here" was written by Dave Wolfenberger and helped at least one person, me, accept Jesus to become his personal Savior. This band came out with two tapes of their music. The first album contained the song "I AM HERE." While I have been told there are at least two versions of this song, one version of the song was recently sung by David and can be listened to at Crossroads Church website though the external link I have placed in the external links. The link will be preceded with the number 2. 
In 1997 Wolfenberger's band the Marshwiggles released their first and only album "Stone Soup" on the local Cincinnati label Blue Jordan Records. It was played nationally and the band toured regionally to sizable crowds but broke up during the recording of their second album just prior to its completion and release. This album has never been released although tracks from it have shown up on Blue Jordan compilations. Wolfenberger then formed the band Thom Scarecrow with acoustic guitarist Jason Dennie and fellow Marshwiggles, Tony Moore and Joshua Seurkamp. This would be a short lived ensemble lasting just over a year.
In 1999 Wolfenberger's first solo album, "Tales From Thom Scarecrow" was released and won him Artist of the Year in his hometown at the Cincinnati Entertainment Awards as well as notoriety abroad from such notable media as the "Corriere della Sera" in Milan, Italy which stated that "Wolfenberger puts forth folk with dark nuances, the grand introspective songs are illuminated with emotions in this exhibition of his life."
In 2000 he joined iconoclastic songwriters Mark Olson and Victoria Williams as a touring and recording member of the Original Harmony Ridge Creekdippers. In 2001 while still touring with the Creekdippers Wolfenberger recorded his second solo album with his band entitled "World of the Satisfyn' Place". This album was decidedly more roots oriented than his first (a return to his style with the Marshwiggles and Thom Scarecrow) and swung wildly from raucous to thoughtful on a song to song basis., It was even more well received by the critics. "The Detroit Metro Times" stated that "Wolfenberger ambles between homespun Appalachian traditions and classic pop and country forms with an unwavering dedication to simple, gorgeous melodies that are alternately uplifting and devastating." While in Britain, Americana-UK called it "a 100% solid gold classic". and his hometown Cincinnati press named it "one of the best albums (local or national) of the year".
In the following two years he would appear on two Creekdipper albums, release a free folk gospel album under the pseudonym Sunrise for Someone and eventually in 2003 stop touring and recording with the Creekdippers although maintaining a close relationship, which would become apparent with the release of his third solo album entitled "Portrait of Narcissus" in 2006 which featured fellow Creekdippers, Victoria Williams, Joshua Grange (by then a regular member of Dwight Yoakam's band), and fellow independent folkie Michelle Shocked. This would be Wolfenberger's first album to be distributed beyond America and Europe into Asia and Australia due to its release by recently revived Fundamental Records. It would even end up at #12 on the independent Euro Americana Chart
In July 2008 Wolfenberger recorded and made available another folk gospel project under the pseudonym Sunrise for Someone entitled "Summer Lake Champion". In August of the same year he released "Just Burned Upon The Page" a live and mostly solo recording of 7 songs. The proceeds benefit the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.

Dwight Schrute

Dwight Kurt Schrute III (born January 20, 1968) is a character on NBC's "The Office", portrayed by Rainn Wilson and based on Gareth Keenan from the original UK version of "The Office". His character is one of the highest-ranking salesmen at the paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin, although the series expands on his character as bed-and-breakfast proprietor at Schrute Farms, a beet plantation, and as the owner of the business park enclosing Dunder Mifflin. He is notorious for his lack of social skills and common sense, his love for martial arts and the justice system, and his rivalry with fellow salesman Jim Halpert. He has at times risen to the position of Branch Manager of the Scranton branch, but often serves as a second or third in command as Assistant (to the) Regional Manager. In the final season, Dwight is finally offered the position of Manager.
Casting.
Dwight Schrute is portrayed by American actor Rainn Wilson. The character is very loosely based on Gareth Keenan of the original British version of the show, who was played by actor Mackenzie Crook.
All original series characters were adapted for the U.S. version. Unlike Steve Carell, Wilson watched every episode of the original British series, and was a fan before he auditioned for the U.S. version. Wilson had originally auditioned for Michael Scott, a performance he described as a "terrible Gervais impersonation"; however, the casting directors liked his audition as Dwight much more, and hired him for the role. Wilson based Dwight's hairstyle on his own style he had when he was sixteen. In an interview, he said that he went to a barber to get "the worst haircut possible."
Character information.
When the series begins, Dwight Schrute is a competent salesman, despite lacking general knowledge, at the Scranton branch of the paper distribution company, Dunder Mifflin. Dwight formally held the title of "Assistant to the Regional Manager", but constantly refers to himself as "Assistant Regional Manager", attempting to elevate himself to second-in-command to branch Manager, Michael Scott. (Michael privately makes him Assistant Manager in "The Fight", tells him that no record/mention will be kept of the "title change only", then never acknowledges it again.) Dwight craves authority over his co-workers, and relishes any minor task that Michael or anyone else will give him. Although Dwight acts superior to many individuals and is often resourceful in crises, he is shown to actually be quite gullible, ignorant, and naïve. For this reason, he is easily tricked and pranked by his desk-mate and fellow salesman, Jim Halpert.
Dwight often speaks in a halting, intense manner, even in casual conversations. At the office, his most recurring formal wear is a mustard-colored, short-sleeved collar shirt, with a dark necktie and, usually, a brown suit jacket. He often uses one-upmanship to better himself over his peers, such as boasting about how he trains specific parts of his body. Dwight will sometimes engage in jokes and games in attempts to appease Michael, but often fails to do so, because of Michael's perception of himself as the jokester of the workplace. After Dwight temporarily leaves Dunder Mifflin, it is shown that he watered the office plant and arranged the toys on Michael's desk in a manner that made Michael happy.
Dwight is a former volunteer sheriff deputy. He is also a notary public; this creates difficulties when Angela desires to send him a notarized letter regarding their break-up. He resides on his family's beet farm, alongside his cousin, Mose (played by producer/writer Michael Schur). Dwight has affinities for paintball, Battlestar Galactica, ping pong, survivalism, Goju Ryu karate and weapons. He also has a preference to ride in the back seat of cars behind the driver, because it is the safest location in a car.
In "Whistleblower", encouraged to invest in real estate by former CEO and owner of Dunder Mifflin, Jo Bennett, Dwight decides to purchase the industrial park building. He has shown entrepreneurial traits, like converting the building lobby into a coffee shop, converting an empty room in the office building into a state-of-the-art gym, and organizing a barn maze before Halloween, where kids can pay admission to play.
In an episode commentary on the season one DVD, Wilson refers to Dwight as a "fascist nerd" who is a predictable caricature of a character that demonstrates the futility of most TV. In a featurette on the season three DVD, Wilson describes Dwight as "someone who does not hate the system, but has a deep and abiding love for it".
Family and childhood.
In "Lecture Circuit", Dwight claims to remember his own birth, including his father delivering him from the womb, and his mother biting off the umbilical cord. In "Grief Counseling", Dwight states that he was a twin, but he "reabsorbed" his twin while still in his Mother's womb (this occurrence is called twin embolisation syndrome), causing him to believe that he now has "the strength of a grown man and a little baby". He also claims to have been born weighing , rendering his mother incapable of walking for three months and two days, and in "Baby Shower", he claims to have performed his own circumcision. In "Viewing Party", he informs Jim and Pam Halpert that, in the Schrute family, the youngest child raises the other children.
Little is known about Dwight's parents, except that his father used to take him hunting, cheated in games, and that he battled obesity, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. In the Season Two DVD bloopers, it is revealed that, when Dwight was a child, his father would take him and his brothers to a swimming hole on hot summer days until 10:00 AM, then they would work in the beet fields until well after midnight. In "Costume Contest", when Dwight sees that Pam has dressed up as Olive Oyl for Halloween, he erroneously believes that she dressed up as his mother, and tells Pam that she is "only one third as beautiful and only half her height". In "Fun Run", Dwight offers to bury Angela Martin's deceased cat, Sprinkles, "At the east field, by Mother", implying that his mother is, too, deceased. However, in "The Lover", after learning that Michael has been dating Pam's mother, Helene, Dwight informs Michael that if he knew that he was "into dating mothers", he would have introduced Michael to his own. While this appears to be a continuity error, it is possible that the woman Dwight is referring to could be his stepmother. It is also plausible that the context of the offer was past tense, which means it may have not been an error.
Dwight's maternal grandfather, whose surname is Manheim (according to Dwight's web log on NBC.com) fought in the Second World War. He had killed twenty men, before being imprisoned in an Allied prison camp (revealed in "The Fight"), implying that he was a soldier in the German army. In "Dunder Mifflin Infinity", Dwight tells the documentary film crew that his grandfather is (at the time of the episode) 103 years old, and is still "puttering around down in Argentina", implying that his grandfather was one of the members of the SS who fled into South America. Dwight attempted to visit him once, but his travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation. In "Take Your Daughter to Work Day", Michael refers to Dwight's grandmother as a "Nazi war criminal". Dwight's father and grandfather are also named Dwight Schrute; however, his Amish great-grandfather was named Dweide Schrude. In "Casino Night", Dwight reveals that the tuxedo he is wearing is the one that his grandfather was buried in. It is possible that this is the same grandfather that was reburied in an "old oil drum" ("Grief Counseling"). In a deleted scene of "The Duel", Dwight reveals that his great-uncle Helmuth was locally renowned for building a makeshift flying machine in four years; but he was promptly killed when said machine landed on a small girl. In a deleted scene from "The Surplus", Dwight tells Angela that his family came to the United States on a U-boat, after she informs him that Andy's ancestors came to the U.S. on the Mayflower. It is revealed in "Money" that the Schrute family has a tradition, where when a male has intercourse with a woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats that are left on his doorstep by his parents. It appears that, like his great-grandfather, other members of Dwight's family have been Mennonite or Amish, as well, as Mose dresses similarly to that of a practicing member. Dwight also speaks German, but his knowledge of it is "pre-industrial and mostly religious", as might be expected if the language was learned exclusively in a Mennonite or Amish church or context.
Dwight was shunned by his family from the age of four until his sixth birthday, for forgetting to save the excess oil from a can of tuna. He lost a grade school spelling bee to Raj Patel by misspelling the word "failure", in front of the entire school. In seventh grade, Dwight played the invented role of "Mutey the Mailman" in a production of "Oklahoma!" He explains that there were not enough roles for all of the children, so they made up roles.
Dwight lives in a nine-bedroom, one-bathroom (which is located under the porch, as revealed in "Office Olympics"), farmhouse on his family's beet farm, alongside Mose, selling beets to local stores, restaurants and roadside beet stands. It is also revealed that Dwight uses part of his farm to grow hemp; in "Launch Party", he claims that teenagers keep stealing it, although a pizza delivery boy, under the impression that it is marijuana, as opposed to hemp, claims that it is "crappy". Dwight and Mose have also turned Schrute Farms into a ramshackle bed and breakfast, that was visited by Jim and Pam, during "Money". The bed and breakfast had three theme rooms, "America, Irrigation, and Nighttime". Schrute Farms was also to be the site of Andy and Angela's wedding, before the two broke off their engagement after Andy discovered she was cheating on him, with Dwight. In "Garden Party", Andy throws a garden party at Schrute Farms, in order to impress new CEO Robert California, and, at the end of the episode, Robert also discusses the possibility of holding his birthday party at the farm.
According to one of Dwight's web logs on NBC.com's "Schrute-Space", he had an uncle, named Gunther, a goat farmer, who fled the Allied invasion of Germany and married a Finnish woman, with whom he had 17 children. He also had an Uncle Girt, who revealed that the Schrute family has an ongoing hatred of Harry S. Truman, because they were staunch supporters of Thomas Dewey. In another blog, he mentions a cousin named Heindl, who received numerous injuries and infections from an attack by a small dog.
Interests.
Dwight is trained in the art of surveillance, and is a former Lackawanna County volunteer sheriff's deputy. He has a purple belt in Goju-Ryu karate, and is the senpai at his dojo. Dwight is a pop culture and sci-fi enthusiast, who has expressed fanship of many sci-fi movies and popular television series. In the episode "The Fire", he mentioned the movie "The Crow" as being his favorite film. He hints at belief in fictional creatures such as androids, zombies and vampires (though curiously, despite having claimed in "Business School", to have shot a werewolf, he says in one of his blog entries that he does not believe in them; however, he may have simply been denying claims of werewolves at Schrute Farms in order to prevent potential visitors from being frightened away). He enjoys, and is shown to be skilled at, playing table tennis, and states that many of his heroes are table tennis players. His musical tastes vary, but heavy metal and classic rock seem to be a recurring theme. His personal musical talents are not lacking, as he plays guitar and recorder, and sings, as well. He has a fascination with cars; he usually checks a car's suspension, especially muscle cars. He drives a 1987 Pontiac Trans Am though in the Finale (The Office) he's driving a 2013 Dodge Challenger. His technological talents are limited, but he shows a passion for the online role playing game "Second Life", in which the only difference between himself and his avatar is that his avatar has the ability to fly. He also shows an interest in trains, as he is restoring a life-size train in his slaughterhouse, during "The Meeting", which has him bonding with Toby Flenderson, as they share the same interest. In "Todd Packer", it is revealed that Dwight does not know who Justin Bieber is, asking Jim "Who is Justice Beaver?", leaving Jim to answer "A crime-fighting beaver."
Dwight owns an impressive array of weaponry. In addition to Laser Tag and paintball equipment, he has a crossbow range at his farm ("Office Olympics") and, when he was named official Security Supervisor of the Scranton branch, hinted that he might bring a bo staff to work. He maintained a hidden arsenal of weapons around the office, including pepper spray, nunchucks, throwing stars, a stun gun, a boomerang, handcuffs, a nightstick, a pair of brass knuckles and a Chinese sword, all of which were confiscated by Toby. Dwight also claimed to have sat at his desk for an entire day with a spud gun, without any difficulty from Security. Dwight also uses a real gun, a Colt Anaconda, fired within city limits, to start off the race in "Fun Run". In "Branch Wars", he produces a disturbing number of Molotov cocktails for a panty raid on Utica. In "Survivor Man", it is revealed that Dwight still has numerous knives (and other weapons) hidden on himself (as in "Stress Relief", there is a knife strapped to his leg) or strategically positioned throughout the office (such as "Mr. A Knife" in a filing cabinet, twin sais behind a water cooler, a sword in a ceiling tile, a blow dart in a bathroom stall, and a compound bow under a couch), and that he owns a .22 rifle with scope. Also, in this episode, it is shown that Dwight has extensive knowledge of how to survive in the wilderness, being able to provide himself with food, and, by observing Michael, from a distance, through the scope of his center-fire rifle, he stops Michael from poisoning himself, although it is not clear whether the mushrooms Michael started to ingest were actually poisonous.
Dwight is vocal about his views on justice, which is reflected in his television viewing habits, as he enjoys watching and has great admiration for Judge Judy, as well as Vic Mackey on "The Shield". In "The Negotiation", Roy Anderson attacks Jim, because he kissed Roy's fiancee, Pam, but Dwight intercepts the attack with pepper spray. Throughout the episode, Jim attempts to show his appreciation, but Dwight refuses to accept his gifts, simply stating "Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens". In "Drug Testing", Dwight finds half of a joint in the parking lot, which incites him to carry out a severe, and thorough, investigation. When he discovers that Michael might have been exposed to illegal drugs at a concert, he substitutes his own urine during the mandatory drug test. Dwight then resigns from his volunteer position at the Sheriff's Department, because he feels that he is no longer worthy of working there. In "Frame Toby", Dwight states that he is skilled at framing people, as well as animals, revealing that he once framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas gift, and a bear for eating out of the garbage, although, he had made it obvious to the police that he wanted Toby to be imprisoned. In the episode "Women's Appreciation", he is quoted as saying "Better a thousand innocent men are locked up, than one guilty man roam free."
In "Conflict Resolution", Dwight states that he does not like to smile, as showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates, and that whenever someone smiles at him, "all sees is a chimpanzee, begging for its life". In "Body Language", Dwight reveals that he and Mose are currently attempting to reanimate a deceased bull. It has been implied that Dwight is against vegetarianism. In "Stress Relief", when asked which charity he dislikes, he states PETA. In "Happy Hour", he tells Isabel that he is pleased that she is not a vegetarian. Dwight's dislike of cats, made evident in "Fun Run", also seems to support this theory, as he states that "cats do not provide milk, wool or meat". Dwight owns many exotic pets including piranhas, frogs, a wolf, a raccoon, and an opossum, although the wolf escaped and he flushed his piranhas down the toilet. He also has an interest in bears, and is ready to debate the habits and characteristics of different species of bears. 
In "Booze Cruise", Dwight claims to have been the youngest pilot in Pan Am history, stating that, when he was four, he and his father were invited into the cockpit of an airplane, and that he was allowed to co-pilot the aircraft. He also claims that he would have been capable of landing it, but his father had wanted them to return to their seats.
In "Costume Contest", Dwight claims to be able to sit on a fence, and that he is even able to sleep on one, stating that "The trick is to do it face down, with the post in your mouth".
It also appears that Dwight is a fan of the band Mötley Crüe, as he is seen in "Performance Review" and "Traveling Salesmen", dancing to their music. He also appears to be a fan of the band The Decemberists, as shown by his family singing their song "Sons and Daughters" in "The Farm", to convince his siblings to run the family farm with him, through the "power of nostalgia".
It is revealed in the "Suit Warehouse" episode that as a child Dwight collected cat feces.
Relationships.
In "Drug Testing", Dwight states that he likes his co-workers, "with four exceptions", leaving it up to the audience to make educated guesses about whom these four exceptions are. The four are most likely Jim Halpert, Ryan Howard, Meredith Palmer and Toby, due to Michael's hatred of him. However, it is also probable that Phyllis Lapin-Vance could be one of the exceptions, as, on many occasions, she and Dwight are shown to have a strained relationship. Kelly Kapoor is likewise a viable choice as her ditsy nature contrasts Dwight's overly serious character, as we see later in the same episode during Dwight's interrogation of Kelly. This theory is also reinforced by Angela's hatred of Kelly and the influence Angela may hold as Dwight's girlfriend at the time. Pam Halpert is also a possible exception as she is often an accomplice to Jim's pranks against Dwight. 
Angela Martin.
Towards the middle of season 2, Dwight develops a secret relationship with Angela Martin. Pam begins to suspect a relationship between the two, in "E-mail Surveillance", by observing their interactions, suspicions which are strengthened in "The Injury" and "Conflict Resolution", and confirmed by "Traveling Salesmen", where Angela confides in Pam about her relationship, using code names. In "Michael's Birthday, Ryan discovers the relationship between the two when he overhears a coded conversation between them in the kitchen, while in "The Negotiation" Jim discovers the relationship while coming out of the office bathroom after quitting time, to find Dwight and Angela kissing (he then tells the documentary crew that, with his silence, the debt he feels to Dwight is repaid), although, on an earlier occasion, he unwittingly glimpsed Angela dressed in lingerie, lying in Dwight's hotel room, but mistook her for a prostitute.
In the episode "Fun Run", Angela asks Dwight to care for her sick cat, Sprinkles. Instead of caring for the feline, Dwight feels he should put Sprinkles out of its misery, and feeds it antihistamines until it falls asleep, to which he then subsequently places the sleeping, but not deceased, cat in Angela's freezer. This backfires, and Angela terminates their relationship. Jim, on a visit to Dwight's beet farm, finds Dwight sitting alone at night, contemplating Angela's cherub figurine and moaning in anguish.
In the fourth season finale "Goodbye, Toby", Dwight is obviously hurt when Angela's boyfriend, Andy, proposes to her. However, in the final scene of the episode, Phyllis re-enters the office, following Toby's farewell party, and catches Dwight having sex with Angela, strongly indicating a reconciliation between the two is possible.
In the fifth season premiere, "Weight Loss", Dwight and Angela have resumed a covert relationship, using a storage room in the warehouse to have sex whenever Angela finds Andy too unbearable. In "Business Ethics", it is revealed that it takes Dwight nineteen minutes and forty-eight seconds to make love to Angela. In "Crime Aid", Dwight once again becomes depressed when Andy and Angela have set a date for their wedding. After some advice from Phyllis, Dwight gives Angela an ultimatum: call off the engagement, or he will no longer be with her. She ultimately chooses to marry Andy.
Phyllis eventually tells everyone, apart from Andy, about Angela's affair with Dwight; Michael steps in and tells Andy, when Angela fails to do so. A duel between Dwight and Andy takes place, but both realize that Angela has been lying to them, and neither one remains with her. For quite some time afterwards, Dwight and Angela avoid each other; however, later episodes have hinted at a possible future for the couple.
In the season 6 episode "The Delivery", Dwight, witnessing Jim and Pam talk to customers about their unborn child, decides that he wants a child, and asks Angela to be the mother. They sign an elaborate contract, including eating guidelines for Angela to follow when she is pregnant, and how the baby will be raised. While Angela seems excited by the reconciliation, Dwight doesn't appear to share her romantic feelings. When Dwight develops an interest in Pam's friend Isabel, he tells Angela to forget about the contract; this infuriates Angela and she sues him in small-claims court. When an arbitrator tells them that the contract is valid and would involve a $30,000 settlement (because it would be illegal to force Dwight and Angela to procreate), Dwight cuts a deal with Angela for five sessions of sex. He then proceeds to abuse his genitals in an effort to sterilize himself, and curtly fends off Angela's efforts to be romantic during Session 6 in "The Chump".
In Season 7, the deal continues, but, a combination of both she and Dwight having mixed feelings about it, along with Angela's meeting of a handsome, though closeted homosexual, State Senator, leads her to void the pact in WUPHF.com. Upon seeing the now-defunct document, Dwight looks visibly distraught.
In "Jury Duty", it is revealed that, a month before her wedding to the State Senator, Robert Lipton, Dwight and Angela had sex, as Robert was not fulfilling Angela's sexual needs, so Dwight believes that he is the baby's biological father. In "New Guys", it is revealed that he is not the father.
In season 9, they become close again first when Dwight finds out that Robert is cheating on Angela with Oscar, and later in "Moving On" when Angela helps him take care of his elderly aunt. They share a kiss, but afterwards both say that she should remain faithful to her husband. After inheriting his aunt's beet farm, Dwight starts a relationship with neighboring milkmaid Esther Bruegger (Nora Kirkpatrick). When Dwight seems to be getting serious with Esther and the Senator has publicly dumped Angela, Angela breaks down and admits to Oscar Martinez (Oscar Núñez) that she still loves Dwight. On the day that he intends to ask Esther to marry him, Dwight instead proposes to Angela. She says yes, finally admitting that he is the father of her son Phillip. ("A.A.R.M.")
Michael Scott.
Dwight holds a high level of respect for Michael, viewing him as a model for success, and often participating with Michael's ill-conceived schemes. With the enormous exception of going over Michael's head to vie for the manager's job in "The Coup", his loyalty to his boss rarely flags. Despite this, Michael frequently dismisses Dwight and often appears embarrassed by his antics; for much of the series, he also refuses to promote Dwight from "Assistant to the Regional Manager" to "Assistant Regional Manager". Several times throughout the series, however, it is revealed that Michael does care about Dwight's feelings, and the two sometimes share bonding moments. In "Training Day", Dwight is unhappy when the open branch manager position goes to Deangelo Vickers, and when he learns that Michael did not recommend him for the job, as he led him to believe, he snubs Michael and goes to a meeting Vickers has called, leaving Michael standing outside, by himself. In "Goodbye, Michael", Dwight is still frustrated with Michael, but his hostility turns into heartfelt appreciation as Michael hands him the recommendation letter. At first, the letter does not seem to impress him, but, as he reads through, he realizes that Michael really does truly care for him. They are later seen engaging in a friendly paintball fight, and Dwight's loyalty to Michael is once again restored.
In the episode "Finale", as Jim explains that the "Bestest Mench" (best man) in Dwight's wedding must be older than him, Dwight is disappointed. However, the camera reveals that Michael returned, and the two continue to engage in a friendly conversation. During the wedding, Michael is present behind Angela and Dwight getting married, eventually attending the reception. He watches as his "family" is sitting together, and is last seen dancing with Dwight.
Jim Halpert.
Dwight is frequently the victim of practical jokes by co-workers Jim Halpert and Pam Halpert, including putting his desk supplies in the snack machine, putting his stapler into jello (also seen in UK version), and moving his desk into the men's restroom, although it appears that he remains oblivious to Pam's involvement; these pranks tend to exploit his stubborn and gullible nature. As a result of this, Dwight and Jim have an ongoing feud that reaches to a crisis point in "Conflict Resolution", when Dwight threatens to quit, unless Jim is transferred. Professionally, Dwight wins the 2005 Salesman of the Year Award, although, this is likely due to, at least in part, his theft of Jim's largest client.
Somewhat surprisingly, Dwight was regretful during "Initiation", as he told Ryan that he and Jim never got along, and since, from that point onwards, and Jim's return from Stamford, they have generally gotten along better; their relationship could be best described as "frenemies." In "Traveling Salesmen", Jim is irritated when Andy replaces Dwight, in the brief time Dwight has quit. Jim even consoled Dwight during the painful aftermath of his breakup with Angela, although Dwight maintains a supercilious attitude towards him. In addition, as shown in "Traveling Salesmen", Jim and Dwight make an incredibly efficient sales team, functioning well as a duo and thinking similarly in their tactics. The two were paired together when they began as traveling salesmen at the company. Dwight did plan to demote Jim from the Assistant Regional Manager spot, and make him miserable, during "The Job", but Jim mocked his plans, and they did not produce any severe impact on Jim.
Dwight's relationship with Jim mellows somewhat in later seasons, and they, at times, cooperate effectively on sales calls or running the office in Michael's absence, sometimes even socializing together. Jim often supports Dwight when he is genuinely hurt or in danger (such as in "Money" and "Last Day in Florida") and occasionally compliments his successes (such as in "Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager"). Dwight has even come to accept Jim's pranks as inevitable, in the eighth season episode "Mrs. California", Jim notices Dwight hiding an aluminum pole under his pant leg so he can stand upright all day and, before tipping him over, says "you know I have to do this" to which Dwight resignedly replies "I know." However, when Jim is promoted to co-manager, Dwight's enmity returns to full force, and he conducts an ongoing campaign to depose Jim, who eventually resumes his old job as sales representative, pleasing Dwight who (wrongly) believes that his "diabolical plan" forced Jim to resign.
Jim and Dwight team up in "Todd Packer", to attempt to remove Todd Packer after he returns to the Dunder Mifflin offices and takes Dwight's desk. The two at first cannot agree on a plan, but eventually trick Packer into thinking he has got a job offer in Tallahassee. Michael tries to derail their scheme, but changes his mind after Packer insults Holly.
During "After Hours", Jim enlists Dwight into trying to get Kathy, an unwanted female suitor, out of his room by tricking Dwight into thinking that he has bedbugs. This prompts Dwight to overreact, first by stripping down to ward off bugs and then spraying Jim's bed with cleaning chemicals. However, the ploy works when Kathy exits the room. Jim and Dwight are then shown sharing ice cream and a friendly smile in Dwight's room, while watching TV on his bed, where it is implied Jim will have to stay the night due to the chemicals in his own room, as earlier Dwight suggested Jim stay with Kathy. In "Last Day in Florida", Robert California confides to Jim that he's going to terminate Dwight's plans to launch the Sabre store, effectively terminating Dwight's job altogether. Jim tries to let Dwight know, who dismisses his warnings as nothing more than just another prank and insults Jim throughout the day, including in front of the other Sabre staff. At Pam's insistence, Jim tries to tell Dwight one more time before he's dismissed, just as Dwight is about to accept what he thinks is his promotion in the board room. However, Jim physically attacks Dwight just before he goes in, and the two had a wrestling match to which Jim finally concedes. When Dwight steps in, he sees that Packer, who has stolen Dwight's promotion in the meantime, takes the fall and is promptly fired by Robert in the meeting. Defeated, Dwight walks out of the boardroom and lends Jim a hand up and returns to Scranton. When Kelly sees Dwight, she mentions that she thought Dwight was staying in Florida, prompting Jim to distract her with a compliment.
During season 9's Dwight Christmas Dwight is convinced by Jim to hold a traditional Christmas party in the style of his family. Jim must leave before the party is over and Dwight is noticeably emotionally upset when Jim must leave. Later, when Jim returns, Dwight embraces him in a hug.
In "Livin' the Dream", the 3rd-to-last episode of the series, Jim suggests to David Wallace that Dwight deserves to replace Andy Bernard as Regional Manager because Dwight loves paper more than anyone else. David agrees and Dwight is promoted to Regional Manager at the end of the episode as a result; Dwight subsequently appoints Jim to fill his old position, Assistant to the Regional Manager.
In the final episode of the series "Finale", Dwight asks Jim to be the best man at his wedding. Jim throws Dwight a commendable bachelor party rife with surprises (which Jim refers to as "pranks"). Before the wedding Jim informs Dwight that, under Schrute tradition, he is not allowed to be best man as he is younger than him. Jim surprises him with the arrival of Michael Scott. The wedding proceeds in Schrute tradition with Michael as Dwight's new best man. Later in the episode Jim and Pam tell Dwight they are quitting so Jim can pursue a sports marketing career in Austin, but Dwight fires them instead so he can give them severance packages.
Pam Halpert.
Although she is often involved in Jim's pranks on Dwight, Dwight has, at certain times, displayed a curious sense of protectiveness towards her. In "Back from Vacation" and "Diwali", he comforts a tearful Pam, and in "China", he secretly allows Pam to save face when she feels vulnerable about her job abilities. The two even become friends after he suffers a concussion in "The Injury". In the season 6 episode "The Delivery", Dwight shows more signs of his begrudging friendship with Jim and Pam during Pam's pregnancy. In the episode, he is sent to the Halperts' house to retrieve Pam's iPod, while they are at the hospital. Instead of finding the iPod and bringing it back to her, Dwight decides to completely rebuild and repaint their kitchen, after discovering mold. He also advises Pam on how to keep her daughter, Cece, from crying, during "Viewing Party", by relating his child rearing experiences. Dwight's odd friendship with Pam is explored again in "Doomsday". At this point, Pam seems to be the only one in the office who is able to understand Dwight's inner feelings, as she successfully convinces him to deactivate his doomsday machine. It is implied at the end of the episode that Dwight, despite his outward contempt for his coworkers, feels a sense of responsibility (and possibly even affection) towards them.
Dwight has several times mentioned not finding Pam particularly attractive. In "The Sting", he refers to her as "one of the plain, hearty women of Scranton" and he thinks that she doesn't wear any make-up. In "Pam's Replacement", when Pam asks Dwight if she is attractive, he says "Meh", and goes on to say that her attractiveness is "at an all-time low" after having had a "steep drop-off" after her first pregnancy.
In a talking-head interview, in the episode "Tallahassee", Dwight talks about how first impressions last forever. He recalls that, when he first met Pam, she said something to him that "slightly rubbed the wrong way", and while he has since loved working with her, even stating that she is wonderful, due to that first impression, he hates her. In the episode "The Whale", Dwight openly tells Pam that he considers her his friend. In the final episode of the series, Dwight refers to Pam as his best friend and ensures that she and Jim get a nice severance as they leave Dunder Mifflin.
Andy Bernard.
As a result of the Scranton-Stamford merger, Dwight loses his number two position to Jim and engages in an ongoing battle with new salesman Andy Bernard, to gain Michael's favor for "third-in-command". The struggle comes to a climax in "Traveling Salesmen". In Season 4, Andy and Dwight are shown to work well together as a sales team, but Andy's successful pursuit of Angela, after she broke up with Dwight, was irritating to him. When Andy gets engaged to Angela, Dwight is greatly upset by this, and embarks on an affair with her. This affair culminates in a short-lived fight between Andy and Dwight, when they discover Angela has lied to both of them, about having sex with another. However, by the end of the fifth season, Andy and Dwight become friends, and discover they both share a mutual interest in music and hunting.
Ryan Howard.
In the beginning of the series, Dwight feels threatened by Ryan Howard, to whom Michael often assigns personal tasks. He continues to resent Ryan, throughout the second season, often addressing him as "Temp", even after Ryan took over Jim's position. In the beginning of season 2, Dwight's friendship with Michael was slightly torn during"The Fire", when Michael seems to be viewing Ryan more favorably than Dwight, and in "Performance Review", in which Michael must evaluate Ryan. In "Initiation", Dwight decides to assist Ryan, during his first sales call, although the two get off to a rough start when Dwight has him undergo a series of bizarre initiation rituals. But soon afterwards, Dwight takes Ryan on his first meeting, which ends in disaster. Ryan then eggs the potential customer's building out of spite, and Dwight develops some respect for him.
During season 4, Dwight, along with Michael, comes to Ryan's rescue when they visit him in New York City, when he gets into a scuffle.
Ryan and Dwight later team up again in season 6, when Dwight plans to sabotage Jim's occupation, as branch co-manager.
Other office staff.
Dwight has an odd relationship with Phyllis, often treating her badly (such as abandoning her across town, so that she would lose weight by walking back), but also well (such as bidding to win a hug from her at the auction in "Crime Aid", and massaging her back when she injured it from dancing). He has a rare interaction with Creed, when he suspects Jim to be a vampire, and he questions Creed if he could make a wooden stake for him, in less than an hour. Dwight has a low opinion of Meredith, once causing her to get bitten by a bat by putting a garbage bag over her head, in order to catch it. During "Todd Packer", he cheers up Kevin upon witnessing Packer insult Kevin for being overweight by telling Kevin that he would be a promising fighter in sumo wrestling. However, during "Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager", when Dwight has to give a back massage to Kevin, he is disgusted. Dwight has little respect for Kelly Kapoor, but at one point tries to become her svengali when he learns that Dunder Mifflin is launching a "Minority Executive Training Program". He soon regrets his decision, however, and tries to convince Hidetoshi from the warehouse to run for the position instead.
Romantic relationships.
A subtle running joke throughout the series is Dwight's surprising success with attractive women, with Michael often failing to "hook up" at the same time. Despite Dwight's unusual appearance and mannerisms, he manages to attract women, who usually develop stronger feelings for him than vice versa. Michael has even pointed out how socially weird Dwight is acting, only for the woman to brush it off. In "Night Out", Dwight hooks up with a women's basketball player, while Michael fails in his attempts with other women. As Michael and Dwight leave the club, the woman calls out for Dwight to call her, which he says to Michael that he will not do. In "Niagara", Michael and Dwight compete for the attention of Pam's best friend, Isabel. When Dwight starts talking about his farm, Michael tries to explain that no one can connect with his experiences as farmer, only for Isabel to become interested in Dwight's horses. Dwight ultimately manages to have sex with her, and she begins to develop deeper feelings for him which he does not return, although it is finally hinted in "The Delivery" that Dwight might have more intimate feelings for her than he originally let on. They meet again at the bar in "Happy Hour", and bond further, kissing at the end of the episode. In a chat at OfficeTally.com, Mindy Kaling noted that Dwight is not a typical "nerd" character, that he is a "farmer and kind of strapping and tall", and it generally makes sense that he does well with the opposite sex.
In the final episode, Dwight marries Angela Martin.
Character reception.
The Dwight Schrute character has had a very positive reception, and is often cited as one of the most popular characters on the show. According to "Entertainment Weekly" he is one of the "greatest sidekicks." In TV Guide's list of the top 100 characters in television history, Dwight was ranked 85th. In an ABC News interview with Rainn Wilson, the interviewer commented that "Words barely describe Dwight Schrute, the suck-up salesman and assistant to the regional manager of the Scranton branch for the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company..." and "Dwight, as played by the 41-year-old Wilson, has become one of the breakout characters in television comedy. Dwight is a survivalist geek, a student of karate who likes to shoot a crossbow and watch "Battlestar Galactica" on television. And he takes himself very, very seriously..." E! News commented that Rainn Wilson should be nominated for an Emmy Award for his performance of Dwight, commenting: "...Who's laughing now? Who's laughing now, Dwight Schrute? Oh, only the ten million-plus people who watched as you pepper sprayed the living daylights out of Roy for trying to pop Jim in the face last night. My God, have I missed you, man. Mr. Schrute, you are the reason I love my job, my friend. It is the selflessly heroic actions of a man such as you that make television a nice place to be on a Thursday night. You may just be an everyday citizen who does not accept prizes for being a citizen, but you'd best be accepting a supporting actor Emmy nod this year, because, hot damn if you don't deserve it."
Another positive review of the character was given by PopMatters, an online entertainment news site. The review stated:
"One of the show’s ironies is that Michael and Dwight, hapless though they might be within the office or in most social settings, are actually top salesmen...Undeterred, or unaware of any of this, Dwight carries on with his dreams of grandeur, even instituting a reward system called "Schrute Bucks" for employees who please him during a brief but tyrannical reign as branch manager...Dwight approaches sales with the same militaristic fervor as everything else in his life, and it pays off for him (maybe that’s one of the reasons why, when Jim gives Dwight one of Benito Mussolini’s speeches to deliver when he accepts a sales award in Season Two, Dwight delivers it so enthusiastically that he gets a standing ovation)..." Metalcore band The Devil Wears Prada named a song "Assistant to the Regional Manager," alluding to Dwight's position. In addition, the band created a T-shirt design that indirectly associates itself with Dwight by strongly resembling him. It is named "Guy Wearing Tie."
Outside of "The Office".
Bobblehead doll.
In the episode "Valentine's Day", Dwight is given a bobblehead doll as a Valentine's gift, from Angela. Following the episode, fans of the show petitioned NBC to make the bobblehead doll available for purchase on their online store. NBC responded by creating an initial run of 4,000 bobblehead dolls, which sold out almost immediately. The creator of the show, Greg Daniels, joked about the bobbleheads, saying "Yes, they are fun, but they also serve a business purpose. People who want to manage by consensus can buy six and keep them nodding all the time to whatever they say." In 2010 Hallmark released a smaller talking version of the doll as part of their 2010 Christmas Keepsake Ornament selection.
Résumé.
In "Halloween", Jim and Pam uploaded Dwight's resume to "Monster.com, Craigslist, and Google." A producer actually did create a Monster account for Dwight and uploaded his résumé a month before the episode aired. It can be found by employers with resume database access who search for salesmen in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

Schrute Farms.
In "Money", Pam refers to a TripAdvisor page for Dwight's bed and breakfast. This can be found by searching for Schrute Farms. Jim and Pam discover that Dwight is running the Schrute Farm as an "agritourism" bed and breakfast. They spend the night there, taking part in table-making demonstrations, beet wine-making, and distributing manure. That night, however, Jim finds Dwight moaning in depression over his break-up with Angela. The TripAdvisor page said:
"Schrute Farms is the number one beet-related agritourism destination in Northeastern Pennsylvania. We offer the finest accommodations for the casual traveler and/or radish enthusiast. Come join us and experience majestic Schrute Farms. "
Jim and Pam ("JandP2") also posted a review, which can be seen on the reviews page. It read: "The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm, and the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedrooms and makes you dream of simpler times. You will never want to leave your room. The informative lecture will satisfy all your beet curiosity, and the dawn goose walk will tug at your heart strings. Table making never seemed so possible. Great story to tell your friends. Plenty of parking! The staff’s attention to detail and devotion to cleanliness was limitless. From their enthusiastic welcome to the last wave good-bye, Schrute Farms delivers."
An angry Angela also put a review up, and mentioned the death of her cat as a main cause for the review. It said: "I have to warn people about the proprietor of Schrute Farms—he may portray himself as a gentleman farmer, but he is not what he seems! He killed my cat, Sprinkles! Who knows what he might do to you or your loved ones..."
According to Dwight, during the Civil War, while the Battle of Gettysburg was known for having the most deaths, the battle of Schrute Farms was known for having the highest DPA (deaths per acre). He also claimed it was the northernmost battle during the Civil War. However, in reality, it was actually a safe haven for men who wanted relief from the war to focus on artistic lifestyles. It is insinuated that this was a camp for homosexual soldiers. Melvin Fifer Garris is the only known soldier to write home from Schrute Farms during the Civil War.
Vice presidential bid joke.
On the May 7, 2008 episode of "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart", US Senator and Republican Party presidential nominee John McCain joked that Dwight Schrute would be his vice presidential candidate choice. Rainn Wilson appeared on "The Tonight Show" on May 14, 2008, and read to Jay Leno a list of demands from Dwight in exchange for being vice president. Included in this list was being able to pilot Air Force One at any time, and only to be addressed as "Iceman" while piloting. He also demanded that Jack Bauer be immediately promoted to United States Secretary of Defense, his bunker to include a foosball table and be zombie-proof, and that the Secret Service members be armed with nunchakus, throwing stars, and flamethrowers. Finally, he demanded a flamethrower, an Iron Man suit, and that fellow character Michael Scott be an "ambassador to Hawaii."
Dwight in academic research.
Researchers at Brigham Young University, Stanford and Northwestern University demonstrated that social outsiders, similar to Dwight's character, lead to better group decision making. Media accounts of their published study reported that having a Dwight Schrute around is good for business. Dwight was included in articles about the research by "Time" magazine, "Toronto Globe and Mail", "The Salt Lake Tribune" and Brigham Young University.
Possible spin-off series and departure from "The Office".
On January 25, 2012, news broke that NBC was planning a spin-off series, starring Wilson as Dwight, that would be set at Schrute Farms, Dwight's bed-and-breakfast and beet farm. The spin-off was to have been created by Wilson and executive producer Paul Lieberstein, but "Office" developer Greg Daniels would not have been involved. The series was in the works for a premiere in early 2013, and would have caused Wilson to leave "The Office" during the ninth season. The spin-off was scheduled to have been introduced as a backdoor pilot in a later episode of the ninth season. Despite the news report, Wilson tweeted "Don't believe everything you read in the press, OK?". In October 2012, NBC announced that it was not accepting the spin-off series.

Sparta High School (New Jersey)

Sparta High School is a four-year public high school serving grades nine through twelve in Sparta Township, in Sussex County, New Jersey, as part of the Sparta Township Public School District. The school completed a $71.5M major reconstruction project.
As of the 2010-11 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,240 students and 90.1 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 13.76:1. There were 17 students (1.4% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 5 (0.4% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch. 
History.
The school opened in September 1959 when Newton High School in neighboring Newton, which had also served Sparta students, could no longer take on Sparta's rapidly growing high school-aged population. The sending districts of Byram and Hopatcong combined with Sparta to form the initial student body. In its first year of operation, Sparta High enrolled over 400 students enrolled in just three grades, including students from not only Sparta, but also from nearby Hopatcong and Byram Township, which shared the school. In May 1964, Sparta graduated its first class—of 160 students—that had attended the school for all four years.
During the 1970s, Sparta High School instituted split sessions to help alleviate problems brought on by increased enrollment. This was only a temporary fix, however, and the town later approved a referendum to build an "annex" onto the back of the school, more than doubling its area. The section added a new cafeteria, a library, and open classroom spaces. 
In the early 1990s, the open spaces provided by the built-on annex were renovated and became closed classrooms. By this time, over one thousand students—all from Sparta—were enrolled in the school. Later in the 1990s, the high school was expanded yet again, adding a new science wing and a number of technological upgrades.
In September 2006, Sparta residents approved a referendum to perform major renovations on the school that aim to bring the school up to date. The construction began in the spring of 2008 and was finally completed by the beginning of the 2010-2011 school year. This reconstruction was to alleviate the issue of overcrowding that the school faced. During the construction, many classrooms were displaced to a cluster of modular trailer rooms.
Awards, recognition and rankings.
The school was the 83rd-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 328 schools statewide in "New Jersey Monthly" magazine's September 2012 cover story on the state's "Top Public High Schools", after being ranked 78th in 2010 out of 322 schools listed. The magazine ranked the school 63rd in 2008 out of 316 schools. The school was ranked 73rd in the magazine's September 2006 issue, which included 316 schools across the state. Schooldigger.com ranked the school tied for 104th out of 381 public high schools statewide in its 2011 rankings (a decrease of 6 positions from the 2010 ranking) which were based on the combined percentage of students classified as proficient or above proficient on the mathematics (86.6%) and language arts literacy (96.2%) components of the High School Proficiency Assessment (HSPA).
Sports.
The Sparta High School Spartans now compete in the Northwest Jersey Athletic Conference, following a reorganization of sports leagues in Northern New Jersey by the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association. Sparta High School had previously been a member of the now-defunct Sussex County Interscholastic League. All sports teams compete in one of three seasons: 
In 2003, Sparta's football team won the North I, Group II state championship at Giants Stadium against Dover High School 16-0, finishing the season with a 12-0 record and making them Sussex County's only 12-win undefeated football team.
The wrestling team won the North I, Group III state sectional championship in 2000 with a 36-29 win against Indian Hills High School.
The 2001 girls basketball team won the North I, Group III state sectional championship with a 36-32 win versus Northern Highlands Regional High School. The team moved on to win the 2001 Group II State Championship, defeating West Morris Mendham High School in the semifinals and Toms River High School South in the finals to take the title.
The girls basketball team won the 2003 North I, Group III title with a 34-28 win against Pascack Valley High School in the tournament final. The 2006 team won the title in a low-scoring match, topping Northern Highlands Regional high School by a final score of 27-18.
In 2005, the softball team won the North I, Group III state title with a 2-1 win against Nutley High School.
In 1995, Sparta's boys' soccer team won the state sectional championship and had a final season record of 21-2. The team finished first in the S.C.I.L with an undefeated record of 18-0.
Academic excellence off the field.
The boys' soccer team has earned the National Soccer Coaches Association of America's High School Boys Team Academic Award for seven consecutive seasons (2003–04 through 2010–11) and nine of ten dating back to 2001–02. To qualify for the award, the team must have a minimum grade point average of 3.25 for the entire academic year. The team GPA is determined by adding every player's GPA, then dividing by the number of players. Sparta is one of only two boys' soccer teams in all of New Jersey to be recognized in each of the past seven years (Woodbury High School is the other).
Graduation rate.
According to the "New Jersey Herald", the graduation rate for Sparta High School was 94.7%. This rate exceeds the national high school graduation rate of approximately 70%. Sparta High School currently has the highest graduation rate in Sussex County.
Clubs and student activities.
Sparta High School has many clubs, academically-related teams and student activities to choose from. The school hosts an Academic Team, Debate Team and countless clubs for whatever interests a student may have. Some progressive groups such as the Gay Straight Alliance are also school sanctioned clubs. The creation of a new club require a teacher sponsor for the cause (tasked with supervising) and approval from the Administration.
Sparta High School has the following clubs and activities: Academic Bowl, Art Club, Beginnings (Literary Magazine), Chemistry Olympics, Choir (Select, Treble, Men's, Freshmen Select, Women's), Debate Team, DECA (Distributive Education Clubs of America), Drama Club, FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America), GSA/Spectrum (Gay Straight Alliance), Habitat for Humanity, History Club, Jazz Bands: Blues Inc! Blues Sanction, JSA (Junior State of America), Key Club, Marching Band/Color Guard, Mock Trial, National Honor Society, "Olympian" (Yearbook), PDP (Peer Development Program), Science League, Science Olympiad, Strings Club, Student Council, "The Spartan Ink" (Newspaper), Theater Productions, and a World Language National Honor Society.

Nu Aurigae

Nu Aurigae (ν Aur, ν Aurigae) is the Bayer designation for a star in the northern constellation of Auriga. It is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 3.96 and is approximately distant from the Earth. This is an evolved giant star with a stellar classification of G9.5 III. It is a red clump star, which indicates that it is generating energy through the fusion of helium at its core. The outer envelope has expanded to 19 times the radius of the Sun and cooled to 4,571 K, giving it the characteristic yellow-hued glow of a G-type star. It shines with 135 times the luminosity of the Sun.
This is an astrometric binary with a suspected white dwarf companion. A 10th magnitude star 54.6 arcseconds away is an optical companion.

Sofia University (California)

Sofia University, formerly known as the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology (ITP) is a private, WASC accredited university. The university's academic emphasis is transpersonal psychology.
Sofia University comprises the Graduate School of Transpersonal Studies, the Graduate School of Clinical and Spiritual Psychology, and the School of Undergraduate Studies. The graduate school curricula, initially developed by co-founders Robert Frager and James Fadiman, focus on six areas of inquiry: the intellectual, emotional, spiritual, physical, social, and creative aspects of life. For further personal development, all students studying on-campus receive instruction in aikido, a Japanese martial art.
As of July 1, 2014, the president is Liz Li, Ph.D.
Degrees Offered.
Pending the approval of The Accrediting Commission for Schools, WASC, Sofia is preparing to offer a Master of Science degree in Computer Science and a Masters in Business Administration. Both degree programs will combine technological development with transpersonal values and skills for the practicing professional.
Sofia University offers programs in a hybrid: face to face / online or on-campus formats so students can choose what best suits their needs and lifestyles.
History.
Sofia University, formerly the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology, was founded in 1975 by Dr. Robert Frager in response to the growing need for a shift in the pedagogy of higher learning. As a graduate from Harvard, Frager had experienced first-hand the conventional approach to the study of psychology and found it to be lacking and often fragmented.
In particular, Dr. Frager's educational ideal hearkened back to the ancient Greek system which held the belief that education should take into account all aspects of the human experience. With this ideal in mind, he set out to create a school of psychology that would fully prepare psychologists to understand human nature from an approach that transcends the pathological and encompasses the whole human being in the context of culture, physical health, mental health, and spiritual health. Today, Sofia University continues to add new programs to broaden its focus in becoming a university that applies transpersonal values to research and education.
What is transpersonal?
Sofia University has long explored the frontiers of psychology and spirituality for the betterment of humanity and the sustainability of the planet.
Transpersonal psychology is full-spectrum psychology that encompasses a continuum of human experience and behavior ranging from severe dysfunction, mental and emotional illness at one end, to what is generally considered "normal", healthy behavior at the other end and various degrees of normal and maladjustment in between – and then goes beyond it by adding a serious scholarly interest in the imminent and transcendent dimensions of human experience: exceptional human functioning, experiences, performances and achievements, true genius, the nature and meaning of deep religious and mystical experiences, non-ordinary states of consciousness, and how we might foster the fulfillment of our highest potentials as human beings.
Transpersonal psychologists work across disciplines and draw on insights from not only the various areas of psychology, but also the sciences of cognition, consciousness, and the paranormal; philosophy; social and cultural theory; integral health theories and practices; poetry, literature, and the arts; and, the world's spiritual and wisdom traditions.
