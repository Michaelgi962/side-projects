Darell Koons

Darell John Koons (born December 18, 1924) an American painter, was for forty years a member of the art faculty at Bob Jones University.
Biography.
Born in Albion, Michigan, Koons earned an undergraduate degree in art from BJU in 1951 and a master of arts degree in art education from Western Michigan University (1955).
In 2010 Koons had more than 45 one-man exhibitions, including exhibitions at University of South Carolina, Wake Forest University, the Mint Museum, Charlotte, NC, Columbus Museum, Columbus, GA, and the Washington County Museum of Art, Hagerstown, MD; and he has participated in at least that many group exhibitions throughout the United States. Koons’ paintings are in hundreds of public and private collections including the Gibbes Gallery, Charleston, SC; the Greenville County Museum of Art, Greenville, SC; the South Carolina State Art Collection; the Governor’s Mansion, Columbia, SC; The Mint Museum, Charlotte, NC; Eastern Michigan University; Warren Wilson College, Swannanoa, NC; Central Wesleyan College, Central, SC; the W. Clement Stone Collection, Chicago; and the Indonesian Embassy. Koons’ paintings have been published in "Contemporary Artists of South Carolina", "Artist/U.S.A.", and three editions of "Prizewinning Art".
Art critics have called his distinctive style “magic realistic,” because the viewer tends to read into the picture more than actually appears. Koons’ deceptively simple paintings, mostly in watercolor or polymer, give the viewer an impression of extreme detail in old buildings such as barns, cotton gins, and mills. In a 2010 interview, Koons told a reporter, "Bob Jones, Sr. once said you can't get the sand out the country boy's ears. That's true with me. An artist must know something about his subject or he will surely have difficulty painting it. My experience as a child and youth in rural Michigan has given me knowledge of my subjects, thus the opportunity to record this passing history of Americana."
In a 1972 interview, Koons noted that he enjoyed playing with space, especially in a building opening. He virtually never included figures in his paintings but he often teased the viewer with open doors that "give the impression of recent activity." Koons’ work has been compared to that of Andrew Wyeth, although Koons himself believed the greatest influences on his art were the shadows and simplicity of Edward Hopper and the straight lines of Mondrian.
Koons made a hobby of giving religious “chalk talks” to church groups especially during the Christmas and Easter seasons. In 1970, Koons joined two other BJU faculty members, Emery Bopp and Carl Blair, to found Hampton III Gallery, one of the first commercial galleries in Upstate South Carolina.

Weston under Wetherley

Weston-Under-Wetherley, often known by locals as just ""Weston"" is a village and civil parish in Warwickshire, England. It is on the B4453 road, north east of the closest town, Royal Leamington Spa. According to the United Kingdom Census 2001 the village had a population of 454 living in 164 houses. The most notable buildings is the parish church of Saint Michael. Weston is unusual amongst settlements in the UK of its size in that there is not a single shop there, the last being demolished in the 1990s nor a pub, which was closed in 2014. Another place to be closed in the 1990s was Weston Hospital which had previously treated people from all around the area. On the hospital site modern houses have been built as well as a children's play area and a village hall.
The Conservative politician, Dudley Smith is one of the best known people to have lived in the village. In November 1605 a group of men, including Robert Catesby, who were involved in the gunpowder plot, passed through the village. They were fleeing from London after the arrest of Guy Fawkes. Apparently they were on their way to Wales (via Warwick Castle to steal fresh horses), after a meeting at Dunchurch, near Rugby.

Penn State Nittany Lions football under Joe Paterno (as an Independent)

Joe Paterno was a head coach of Penn State Nittany Lions football, serving from the retirement of Rip Engle after the 1965 season until he was fired on November 9, 2011, in the wake of the Penn State sex abuse scandal. His teams played their home games at Beaver Stadium in University Park, Pennsylvania. Penn State played as an independent through the 1992 season. In 1993, the Nittany Lions started playing a Big Ten Conference football schedule.

Despite posting its second consecutive undefeated, untied season, the Nittany Lions did not have a shot at the national championship. President Richard Nixon said that he would consider the winner of the December 6 matchup between the Texas Longhorns and the Arkansas Razorbacks, then ranked at the top of the polls, and the real voters do not seem to have differed. At the time, national champions were selected before bowl games were played. Paterno, at the 1973 commencement, was quoted saying, "I'd like to know how could the president know so little about Watergate in 1973 and so much about college football in 1969?" Then Pennsylvania Governor Raymond Shafer, got the White House's attention with Penn State's 2 season undefeated streak. A White House assistant called Paterno to invite him and the team to the White House to receive a trophy for their accomplishment. Paterno has stated many times that he responded with, "You can tell the president to take that trophy and shove it." Penn State declined an invitation to play the Texas/Arkansas winner in the Cotton Bowl.

Navy.
Penn State capitalized on a fumble and two short punts to score three second-quarter touchdowns and break the game wide open against Navy. The Nittany Lions opened scoring with just one second left in the first as QB Tom Shuman hit SE Gary Heyman for a touchdown to cap an 88-yard drive. On the first play after the ensuing kickoff, E Greg Murphy recovered a fumble by RB Bob Jackson at the Navy 41, and the Lions took two-and-a-half minutes and five plays to score again. Penn State scored on two more quick drives of 60 and 51 yards following short punts into a stiff wind by John Stufflebeem. The Lions added a field goal by Chris Bahr midway through the third and backup QB John Clark capped a 56-yard drive with a keeper to put Penn State ahead 37-0. The final points of the contest came when a snap from Navy's center sailed over Stufflebeem's head and out of the end zone for a safety.

DJ Darkzone

DJ Darkzone (born Michael Baur) is a German underground electronic music producer and DJ.
Career.
Baur worked for some time as a club DJ, a radio DJ, and a music producer for various advertising companies. In 1989, Baur expanded his musical career by establishing the Manifold Records Music & Marketing label. For the label's first release, Baur produced the vinyl-only single "I Like the House" under the alias "Beatproduction." The song became quite popular throughout local clubs and private radio stations and would earn Baur considerable success. With his newfound success, Baur went on to establish his own recording studio for his music and advertising productions, and he also founded a music publishing company.
One of the Manifold label's greatest successes came in 1995, when Baur, working under the alias "DJ Crack," released the song "Singular." The song was played during the Mayday music festival of that year, and quickly became an underground club hit.
To this date, Baur has released numerous successful club hit singles, most popular in the underground club scene in Europe. However, Baur's first move into the mainstream music scene came when he licensed several of his label's songs to be included on the soundtrack for the highly popular Rockstar racing video game Midnight Club II.
Genres and aliases.
Currently, Michael Baur tours as a club DJ throughout Europe and the United States. Baur is notorious for his use of many aliases in order to differentiate between the many genres of his music productions. His use of numerous aliases arguably enhances his underground status to an extreme. Most of his releases are under the "DJ Darkzone" and "DJ Crack" aliases, both classified under techno and trance. DJ Darkzone is most famous in the United States for his song "Infinity in Your Hands," which was primarily featured in the commercials for Midnight Club 2.
Under another alias, "Michael da Brain," Baur produces songs in the acid techno genre. Fellow label producers Franz Merwald and Ray Clarke also produce their own acid techno songs under their own separate aliases. Together, the three release their acid techno songs under the group alias "Brain," sometimes collaborating on individual Brain songs as well. Along with their song names, Brain songs are given numbers in the order of their time of release, starting from "Brain 1."
Michael Baur and several other artists (including labelmates Ray Clarke and Eric del Mar) produce songs under the group alias "Code" in the same fashion as "Brain." Baur has over 13 unique aliases, not including those used in group aliases. Genres of his music include, but are not limited to: hip hop, hardcore techno, jungle, acid techno, trance, dance, and house. Michael Baur tends to remix his labelmates' songs exclusively. He has been known to remix one of his own songs and then attribute the mix to a different alias of his.

<doc id="9654531" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9654531" title="The Graham Norton Show">
The Graham Norton Show

The Graham Norton Show is a British comedy chat show broadcast on BBC One in the United Kingdom. It was shown on BBC Two from February 2007 to May 2009 and has been on BBC One since October 2009. Presented by Irish comedian Graham Norton, the show's format is very similar to his previous Channel 4 programmes, "V Graham Norton" and "So Graham Norton", both of which were also produced by So Television.
Programming.
BBC Two.
The show mirrors "So" and "V" with strong adult humour along with Graham's monologue at the beginning of the show and often a musical guest to play out over the credits. Although the rude objects in "Graham's drawer" did not survive, the phone calls and hidden camera surprises have. These surprises are sometimes based around the guests, such as Sarah Beeny's dating website, a TARDIS on the South Bank when David Tennant appeared and a wine-tasting group drinking Gérard Depardieu's wine whilst he was on the show. Some of the surprises, such as the wine-tasting, have been arranged through ideas submitted by viewers, stating where they will be when the show is recorded.
At the end of the show, after any band or artist performance, an extra 5 minute section of the show was recorded, known as the "Cooldown". This section is seen in an extended weekend repeat, called "Graham Norton Uncut", and is also made available as a downloadable podcast. As well as showing the "Cooldown", it also includes previously unseen parts from the original episode. This section often involves the audience, such as guessing an audience member's partner and playing mass charades.
After Graham's short monologue, he always introduced two guests. If there was a third guest, they are usually introduced later in the show. If the two guests are connected in some way (for example, Dustin Hoffman and his wife), they were the only ones introduced at the start. If musical guests are involved in the show, one of several things happened. Sometimes performers, such as Enrique Iglesias were on stage from the very beginning. Others, such as Gareth Gates came on stage about 5 to 7 minutes before their performance for a short interview. Also, some musical guests only perform during the end credits and participate in the Cooldown section of the programme. However, all bands perform during the credits and were interviewed in the Cooldown segment.
BBC One.
Once the show moved to BBC One, the show moved to Monday nights, the guest increased to 3 or occasionally 4 people, with an accompanying reduction in Norton's signature pieces. A typical show was made up of one big celebrity name, a comedian sitting in the aforementioned "comedy chair" and a well-known musical personality who would all be introduced after the monologue. Sometimes three guests are introduced at the top of the show with the musical guest brought in about 10 to 15 minutes before the end of the show.
Unlike the BBC Two show, the BBC One show does not end with the musical performance, but with a new audience participation segment called "That's All We've Got Time For", where audience members sit in the famous red chair and begin to tell a humorous story. Graham and his guests listen to the stories and if Graham - or occasionally a guest - gets bored, he pulls the lever and the chair falls backwards, dumping the speaker from it.
After the end of "Friday Night with Jonathan Ross", it was announced that "The Graham Norton Show" would be taking over the coveted Friday night slot. The show premiered on Friday, 22 October 2010.
Series.
The first series began at 10pm on 22 February 2007 on BBC Two and was originally slated to end on 24 May 2007 after 13 episodes. However, the series proved such a hit that it was extended for an additional six episodes.
A 12-week second series began on 11 October 2007, and culminated with a Boxing Day special and New Year's compilation from previous episodes.
The show made its North American premiere on BBC America on 2 June 2007, one week after what was supposed to be the final episode of Series 1 (before its extension).
Series 2 premiered on BBC America on 20 October 2007. Unlike the previous series, each episode premiered in the United States only 9 days after the initial UK broadcast. However, the final three episodes were broadcast in reverse order (with Episode 12 being shown on BBC America a few days earlier than on BBC Two. The same thing occurred in Series 4 with the Christmas special airing on BBC America 10 days before the BBC Two broadcast.
Series 3 began its run on 17 April 2008. For series 3, the "Cooldown" segment has been dropped, and the uncut show is just the full uncut 45-minute version of the show.
The show was originally recorded in studio 2 at The London Studios, but moved to studio 1, due to the slot of "The Paul O'Grady Show" and the high audience numbers.
The show continues to be broadcast in a 30-minute version on Thursdays at 10pm with Graham Norton Uncut, the uncut version shown on Sundays at around 11pm in a 45-minute version. However, BBC Two in Wales sometimes broadcast the Thursday edition later than the rest of the BBC Two regions, usually after "Newsnight" at 11:20 pm because they would usually have local programmes in the 10:00pm slot. BBC Two Northern Ireland has also done the same, and they have during series three, broadcast Thursday's show on Friday nights at 10pm on BBC Two Northern Ireland because of local programming on Thursdays.
Series 4 began its run on 3 October 2008 at 10pm on BBC Two (however both BBC Two Wales and BBC Two Northern Ireland broadcast the show at a later time due to their regional programming). The Sunday uncut editions have been kept, with the first uncut edition to be broadcast on BBC Two late on Sunday night.
Speaking on ITV's "This Morning" on 21 January 2009, Norton said he would be back with the chat show in March 2009. As he was appearing in a West End play at the time, he mentioned he would have to miss the Saturday performance during the run of the play, as this is the day he records the show for the BBC.
International broadcasts.
In the United States, starting 11 April 2013, cable/satellite/FIOS (fiber optic) channel BBC America aired new episodes Thursdays at 10 pm ET, six days after the BBC broadcast. It currently airs every Saturday night on BBC America.[http://www.bbcamerica.com/the-graham-norton-show/about-the-show/]

Julie M. J. Parisien

Julie Madelein Josephine Parisien (born August 2, 1971) is a former World Cup alpine ski racer from the United States. She specialized in the technical events of slalom and giant slalom. Parisien was the silver medalist in the slalom at the 1993 World Championships and competed in three Olympics.
Born in Montreal, Canada, Parisien's mother was born in Australia and her father, an orthopedic surgeon, in Canada. The family moved from Quebec to Maine when Julie was less than a year old. She and her three siblings were raised just outside of Auburn, about a mile (1.6 km) from the Lost Valley Ski Area. On skis at age two, she followed her two older brothers and attended the Burke Mountain Academy in northeastern Vermont. Her siblings Rob (b. 1970) and Anne-Lise (b. 1972) also competed at the Olympics in alpine skiing. The eldest brother, Jean Paul (1968–92), captained the Williams College ski team and coached at Burke Mountain Academy. He was killed in a hit-and-run highway accident in December 1992, forced off the road by a drunk driver.
Parisien had won her third World Cup race in late November 1992 at Park City, and in the first two slalom events in January 1993 she placed fourth and sixth. She then won the silver medal in the slalom at the World Championships in Japan. But the loss of her brother affected her and she struggled in the 1994 season. After a disappointing 1994 Winter Olympics, Parisien left the U.S. Ski Team and competed on the women's pro tour in North America. She was rookie of the year in 1995 and finished second in the standings. Parisien dominated the pro tour next two years, then successfully qualified for the 1998 Olympics, and finished 13th in the slalom at Nagano. At her first Olympics in 1992 in France, she held a slim lead after the first run in the slalom but finished fourth, missing a medal by 0.05 seconds.
After summer glacier training with the U.S. Ski Team in Europe, Parisien decided it was time to retire from competition in the fall of 1998. She was inducted into the Maine Sports Hall of Fame in 2001 and the National Ski Hall of Fame in 2006.

Josh Sims

Joshua S. "Josh" Sims (born July 29, 1978, in Annapolis, Maryland) is a professional lacrosse player who is currently playing for the Chesapeake Bayhawks of Major League Lacrosse in 2013 and last played box lacrosse in the National Lacrosse League with the Philadelphia Wings in 2010. He starred as a member of the Princeton Tigers men's lacrosse team from 1997 through 2000. He is a two-time NCAA champion, two-time MLL champion, and one-time NLL champion.
At Princeton, he earned Ivy League Player of the Year honors, three first team United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) All-American recognitions and three first team All-Ivy League selections, two NCAA midfielder of the year honors, NCAA Top VIII Award recognition and two-time Academic All-American (first team once) honors. During his college career, Princeton earned four Ivy League championships, four NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament invitations and two NCAA championships.
As a professional, he is a five-time MLL All-star and an NLL All-star. In the MLL, he has earned two league championships and holds the all-time league record for playoff goals scored. He also has an NLL championship. He was selected to the MLL 10th Anniversary team in August 2010 and the Colorado Mammoth 10th Anniversary team in 2011
Background.
As an ambidexterous junior lacrosse midfielder, he scored 20 goals and had 16 assists for the Severn School, earning him All-Anne Arundel County honors from the "Baltimore Sun". Sims was an All-Anne Arundel County selection by the "Baltimore Sun" again as a senior captain when he was also named an All-Metro selection for controlling 72% of his face-offs, while scoring 28 goals and adding 12 assists. Sims was a member of the Under-19 Team USA that won the World Championship in Tokyo in 1996.
Collegiate career.
After graduating from Severn, Sims attended Princeton University. He was the first Princeton Student-Athlete to be presented with the NCAA Top VIII Award (the first lacrosse player to be presented with the award since 1983). He was only the fourth Ivy League athlete honored in the award's 27-year history. He was awarded the 1998 & 2000 McLaughlin Award as the best NCAA lacrosse midfielder. He was a first team USILA All-American Team selection in 1998, 1999 and 2000. He was also first team All-Ivy League in 1998, 1999 and 2000. Sims earned the 2000 Men's Ivy League Player of the Year. As a freshman, he was a member of the 1997 team that is regarded as the best in school history with a record number of wins during its 15–0 season. He served as co-captain of the 2000 team. Sims is one of two Princeton Lacrosse two-time Academic All-Americans. Following the 1999 season, he was selected as an at-large second team Academic All-American, and following the 2000 season, he was a first team selection. He was also a 2000 USILA Scholar All-American.
The 1997–2000 teams were 6–0 undefeated outright Ivy League Conference champions. Two of these undefeated league champions won the 1997 and 1998 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championships, becoming the first team to threepeat since Syracuse from 1988–90 and the first to be recognized to have done so without an NCAA scandal since Johns Hopkins from 1978–80. The 1999 and 2000 teams also earned NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship invitations, bringing the schools streak to eleven consecutive seasons.
In Sims' first game as a Tiger, he scored the game-winning goal in a 1997 overtime 7–6 victory over Johns Hopkins. Ten years later, ESPN described the goal as a "leaping, behind-the-back" shot, while the "Baltimore Sun" described the shot by saying that ". . .Sims flicked in a rebound shot blindly behind his back." He was recognized twice in 1997 as Ivy League Rookie of the Week. During the 1998 season, Sims became a scoring threat from midfield as most defenses focused on the All-American trio of Princeton attackmen (Jesse Hubbard, Chris Massey and Jon Hess). In the 1998 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament, Sims scored a game-high four goals in the quarterfinal 11–9 victory over Duke and a team-high three goals, including the game-winning goal in the semifinal 11–10 victory against Syracuse. For his efforts, he was named to the All-tournament team. In 1999, he scored a quadruple overtime game-winning goal helping Princeton secure it invitation to the 1999 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament with its seventh consecutive victory.

Tees-Tyne Pullman

The Tees-Tyne Pullman was a British Pullman train which formerly operated on the East Coast Main Line between London King's Cross and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England. It first operated in 1948. Other than the "Golden Arrow", it was the first British Pullman train to operate with a bar carriage - known as ""The Hadrian Bar.""
The train was initially operated with Pullman carriages built in 1928. These were replaced in late 1960 and early 1961 by new carriages built by Metro-Cammell based on the British Rail Mark 1 design. In 1969 the second class accommodation was replaced with ordinary carriages and the popular "Hadrian Bar" carriage was withdrawn. The remaining first class carriages were repainted into grey livery with blue window surrounds. 
By the 1970s the non-air conditioned Pullman carriages were becoming dated, especially in comparison to the newer British Rail Mark 2 carriages then being introduced. With the imminent introduction of InterCity 125 trains, the "Tees-Tyne Pullman" was finally withdrawn in 1976.

Foreigners out! Schlingensiefs Container

Foreigners out! Schlingensiefs Container (Ausländer raus! Schlingensiefs Container), alternately named ""Wien-Aktion"", ""Please Love Austria—First European Coalition Week"", or ""Foreigners Out—Artists against Human Rights"", is an art project and television show from 2000 that took place within the scope of the annual Wiener Festwochen. It was conceptually designed by Christoph Schlingensief and directed by Paul Poet, and was styled as a mockery of popular TV program format "Big Brother". It was critically aimed both at certain forms of television entertainment and at a latent xenophobia still thriving in the whole world.
Political implications.
The show was produced in Austria, and broadcast from the container set installed in Vienna. Shortly before Schlingensief came up with this project, the Freedom Party of Austria, under the leadership of Jörg Haider had been elected into the National Council of Austria and formed part of the new government.
Concept.
The concept of the show was that a dozen real asylum seekers lived inside containers, but instead of being voted out of the show (like in "Big Brother"), the candidates were to be voted out of the country. Creating and utilizing such a situation of living in a strictly confined area, not knowing what would happen next, was to remind the audience of Nazi concentration camps, pointing at and making artistic use of existing parallels between the Nazi camps and television formats like Big Brother.
Methodology.
Installing TV programs and other projects as mockeries of well-known existing formats is part of Schlingensief's methodology. In another show broadcast in Germany, "Freakstars 3000", he set up a talent cast show where all candidates where mentally handicapped. In the theatre project "Quiz 3000" (the '3000' was a recurring trademark of Schlingensief), he mocked the show "Who wants to be a millionaire?", using questions like "Please sort the following concentration camps from north to south".

Top of the World (TV series)

Top of the World is a quiz show series that was produced by Thames Television and aired on the ITV network for one series in 1982. The programme was hosted by Eamonn Andrews.
In the first 12 episodes, there were three contestants; one in the UK studio, one in a studio in Australia, and one in a studio in the USA. 
The game consisted of three rounds. In the first round, each contestant was asked four questions about the UK, four about Australia, and four about the USA (for example, what was the name of this bridge; each correct answer was worth one point. In the second round, each contestant had two minutes to answer questions on a chosen subject, with each correct answer worth two points; returning champions were asked general knowledge questions. The final round was a four-minute buzz-in round; each correct answer was worth three points, but an incorrect answer resulted in losing three points. The player with the highest score won and came back the next week.
In addition to competing against each other, the contestants were competing against the other 11 contestants from their own countries. After 12 episodes, the contestants with the highest scores in their countries competed against each other; the Australian and USA players were flown to England, and all three contestants competed in the same studio. (The American champion was mystery writer William L. DeAndrea.) The winner received what was billed as "the world's top prize" - an early-20th Century Rolls Royce (which, in one episode, was said to have appeared in the movie "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang").

<doc id="9654611" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9654611" title="Don Coldsmith">
Don Coldsmith

Don Coldsmith (February 28, 1926 – June 25, 2009) was an American author of primarily Western fiction. A past president of Western Writers of America, Coldsmith wrote more than 40 books, as well as hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles. His "Spanish Bit Saga", a series of related novels, helped to re-define the Western novel by adopting the point of view of the Native Americans, rather than the European immigrants.
Biography.
In addition to his career as a writer, Coldsmith was a medical doctor, serving as a family practitioner in Emporia, Kansas, until 1988, when he chose to concentrate on writing. In addition, Coldsmith and his 2nd wife Edna were cattle ranchers and breeders of Appaloosa horses.
Son of a Methodist preacher, Coldsmith attended high school in Coffeyville, Kansas, and joined the U.S. Army in 1944. His role as a combat medic in the Pacific Theater of World War II led him to Japan, where he was among the first occupying troops. He was assigned to provide medical care for Japanese war criminals, including Hideki Tōjō, the prime minister.
After the war, Coldsmith matriculated at Baker University, a small Methodist institution in Baldwin City, Kansas. While there he became a brother to the Zeta Chi fraternity. After graduation, he worked as a YMCA youth director in Topeka, where he helped to achieve the first interracial public swimming pool in the state.
Subsequently, Coldsmith went to medical school at the University of Kansas in Kansas City, Kansas, where he earned his doctorate in 1958. 
Coldsmith, who had periodically taught English classes at Emporia State University, was awarded the Western Writers of America's Golden Spur award for best original paperback for "The Changing Wind" of 1990. Other honors include Distinguished Kansan (awarded by the Native Sons and Daughters of Kansas in 1993) and the Edgar Wolfe Award for lifetime contributions to literature (1995). Coldsmith was in high demand as a speaker, especially when the subject was the High Plains and the American West.
Coldsmith suffered a stroke on June 20, 2009 after attending a conference of the Western Writers of America in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He died on June 25, 2009 at The University of Kansas Hospital in Kansas City, Kansas, according to his wife Edna.
Style.
Coldsmith employs a distinctly lucid and deceptively simple style in his fictional narratives. His prose does not attract attention to itself, with the result that the focus is almost entirely on the story. His characters, who may at first seem uncomplicated, gradually emerge as well-rounded human beings with a complex of often conflicting motives and emotions. Coldsmith's Native American protagonists are genuine, and often likable, human beings. At the same time, Coldsmith's villains, who are usually Indians themselves, are portrayed as being misled, or suffering from delusion, more than being evil in some sinister or fundamental way. 
Though generally well balanced in his portrayal of Native American societies and immigrant societies, Coldsmith's narratives often offer gentle—and sometimes not so gentle—criticism of European-American culture, especially in matters of the spirit.
Coldsmith uses English to achieve the illusion of a native point of view with consistent use of such expressions as "I am made to think. . ." and "Elk-Dog" (for horse) and "Cold Maker" (for winter) .
The Spanish Bit Saga.
The Spanish Bit Saga, arguably Coldsmith's best known work, chronicles the unique moment in history when the horse was introduced to the Plains Indians by Spanish explorers, one of whom is separated from his party and adopted by a fictional Plains tribe. The adventures and experiences of the explorers’ Spanish-Indian descendants make up the bulk of the Spanish Bit series.
Coldsmith's fictional tribe in the Spanish Bit series appears to be a synthesis of cultural traditions of the Kansa, Lakota, Kiowa, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Blackfeet, and others. The Pawnee are often depicted as the enemy.

Mason Proper is an American rock band formed in Alpena, Michigan in 2004. The band consists of singer Jonathan Visger, keyboardist Matt Thompson, bassist Zac Fineberg, guitarist Brian Konicek and drummer Garrett Jones.
History.
Formation and "Moth".
The band formed in Alpena, Michigan in 2004, and recorded extensively throughout the year. The band went through a series of personnel changes in the process of finishing their debut album, recording with drummer Matt Davis, and Ypsilanti bassist Zac Fineberg. Finally, on 17 January 2006, they released "There Is A Moth In Your Chest" on their own Mang Chung label. Cover art was provided by Grandaddy drummer Aaron Burtch.
Dovecote and "Moth" Re-Release.
2006 saw the group focus on promoting the debut album, touring across the country and recording sessions such as their WOXY.com Lounge Act in May. In September, the band signed with New York-based Dovecote Records, and the self-released version of their debut immediately went out of print. The band released a re-mixed, re-mastered, and in parts re-recorded version of "There Is A Moth In Your Chest" in 2007 for Dovecote.
The Shorthand EP.
The band toured through most of 2007 in support of "Moth," afterwards releasing a four-song EP of new material entitled "Shorthand. " The band continued to produce the recordings at home. The EP was released only on iTunes and included a music video for each song.
Olly Oxen Free.
To begin work on their second album, the band met with producer/engineer Chris Coady (TV on the Radio, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Blonde Redhead) for a preproduction session in April 2008. At this session, the band listened through approximately 30 songs Jonathan had written, and together with Chris selected 11 songs to refine.
They rented a vacant house and the band recorded and produced what would become "Olly Oxen Free." Immediately after, Jonathan flew to Carriage House Studios in Connecticut to meet up with Chris and mix the album in an 11-day marathon session. Due to mixing time constraints, they made the decision to drop "The Cure (I Don't Want It)" from the album, which was later completed but never released.
"Olly Oxen Free" was released on September 23, 2008 on Dovecote Records. To promote the album, the band played a show at local Ann Arbor venue The Blind Pig, along with another popular local band, The Novel Citizen.
In Concert and the Media.
Mason Proper has toured extensively throughout the United States, and minimally in Canada. The band performed live on Canadian MTV, and done recorded sessions for Fearless TV, KEXP, Daytrotter, and WOXY.com.
They've done several tours with Via Audio, Mobius Band, Ra Ra Riot, Stellastarr, Birdmonster, Saturday Looks Good to Me and Cloud Cult.

Gerald Howard

Sir Stephen Gerald Howard, KC (7 June 1896 – 25 June 1973) was a British farmer, barrister and judge who was an active National Liberal and later Conservative Party politician. He had a junior role on the prosecution team in several celebrated trials in the immediate post-war era.
First World War.
Howard was the son of Stephen Goodwin Howard, who was Liberal Party Member of Parliament for Sudbury between 1918 and 1922. He was sent to Harrow School, but interrupted his education in 1916 to join the Royal Flying Corps. He became a Flight Lieutenant in the Royal Air Force on its formation in 1918. Later that year he left the RAF to go Balliol College, Oxford where he studied law.
Criminal law barrister.
Following his father's political affiliations, Howard was a candidate at the 1922 general election for Eye in Suffolk as a National Liberal with Conservative Party support. In 1924, Howard was called to the Bar by Lincoln's Inn. He became a criminal law barrister, generally appearing as a junior for the prosecution; he also remained very attached to East Anglia where he farmed on the family estate. While appearing not to have any personal interest in the way the case turned out, he was a skillful advocate and appeared in many high-profile cases. In November 1936 he was appointed to be third junior counsel for the crown (a crown prosecutor) at the Old Bailey (Central Criminal Court). In December 1942 he was elected a Bencher of Lincoln's Inn.
Prominent trials.
Howard was appointed Recorder of Bury St Edmunds (a part-time judicial post) in 1943. He was adopted as Conservative Party candidate for Cambridgeshire in November 1944, but unexpectedly lost the seat in the 1945 general election by 44 votes. Earlier that year, Howard had prosecuted in the "Cleft chin murder trial". Howard was High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire for the year 1945 to 1946, and became a senior Prosecuting Counsel at the end of the year. He was also Recorder of Ipswich from 1947 and Chairman of Quarter Sessions for Cambridgeshire from 1947.
The period between 1945 and 1950 saw Howard's most prominent cases. The week after the election he prosecuted John Amery for treason, and he was also third prosecution counsel at the trial of William Joyce ('Lord Haw Haw') with Attorney General Sir Hartley Shawcross and Laurence Byrne. He prosecuted other treason trials arising out of the war. He was on the prosecution team for Thomas Ley and Lawrence Smith (the "Chalkpit murder") in 1947, and in 1949 he took part in the trial of John George Haigh, the "Acid Bath murderer".
Parliamentary career.
At the 1950 general election, Howard was elected for Cambridgeshire, regaining the seat from Labour. He was made a King's Counsel on election and remained in practice as a prosecutor. In Parliament he remained loyal to the Conservative whip, and in 1952 successfully defended "The Times" against a charge arising out of advertisements issued during the 1951 general election criticising nationalisation. In 1952 he became Chairman of Quarter Sessions for East and West Suffolk and in 1958 he was made Recorder of Southend.
Judgeship.
In January 1961, Howard's name headed a list of new Judges of the High Court of Justice, on the Queen's Bench Division, which vacated his seat in Parliament. He received a Knighthood with the appointment, as was traditional. Howard was on the Judicial Bench for ten years before retiring.

New Paths to Helicon, Pt. 1

"New Paths to Helicon, Pt. 1" (almost always referred to as "Helicon 1") is a song by Scottish band Mogwai. It was first released as a double A-side with "New Paths to Helicon, Pt. 2" on 7" limited to 3,000 copies. It was later included on the 1997 compilation album, "Ten Rapid (Collected Recordings 1996-1997)". The single reached #2 in English radio presenter John Peel's Festive Fifty Chart in 1997.
The single's cover art shows details from the McMinnville UFO photographs.
Overview.
"Helicon 1" is a regular part of Mogwai set lists. A live version of the song (recorded by Steve Lamacq from a BBC Radio Session at Maida Vale in March 1999) can be found on Mogwai's 2005 live compilation album, ', as well as UK music magazine "Selects 2000 compilation CD, "The Deep End". Another live version of "Helicon 1" (recorded at Rothesay Pavilion, Isle of Bute on 14 April 2001) can be found as B-sides on the Australian, New Zealand and Japanese releases of the "My Father My King" single, as well as the 2001 "UK/European Tour EP". When the song is played live, Stuart Braithwaite and Dominic Aitchison switch instruments, Aitchison playing guitar, and Braithwaite on bass, usually sitting down. Braithwaite has commented on this:
Musical composition.
The song begins with almost inaudible guitar, heavily delayed and reverberated, playing a descending three note melody. At (0:25), a bass riff (based around the chords of D major and B minor) enters. At (1:00), slightly distorted, heavily delayed and reverberated guitars begin playing along to the bass riff, swooping in and out. At (1:34), a relaxed, slow drum beat begins. At (2:50), all of the instruments pause for a brief second, then explode into loud guitar-driven noise, backed by a steady, heavy drumbeat (to which every snare drum beat is accompanied by a tambourine clash). At (4:28), the distorted guitars and drums end, leaving the soft bass riff to close the song, aided by the guitar melody heard at the start of song, all of which gradually fade out.
Live versions of the song are performed at a substantially slower tempo.

Rather than using a first-person perspective cockpit used throughout the series, "Arena" is played from a top-down perspective on a 2D plane with the third axis reserved for special maneuvers, using a control scheme that resembles a first-person shooter.
The producer, Sean Penney, is a longtime fan of the franchise. Early in development, Electronic Arts sought input from members of the original "Wing Commander" development team, such as Chris Roberts, and from the Wing Commander online community.

Kurt Knispel

Kurt Knispel (20 September 1921 – 28 April 1945) was a Sudeten German Heer panzer loader, gunner and later commander, and was the highest scoring tank ace of World War II with a total of 168 confirmed tank kills; the actual number, although unconfirmed, may be as high as 195. He is counted with Johannes Bölter, Ernst Barkmann, Otto Carius and Michael Wittmann as being one of the, if not the, greatest tank ace of all time.
Childhood.
Knispel was born in Salisov (Salisfeld), a small settlement near the town of Zlaté Hory (Zuckmantel) in Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia. He spent most of his carefree childhood in nearby Mikulovice (Niklasdorf) where his father worked in an automotive factory. After completing his apprenticeship in an automobile factory in early 1940, Knispel applied to join the armoured branch of the German Army.
War service.
Training.
For his basic training, Knispel went to the Panzer Replacement Training Battalion at Sagan in Lower Silesia. There he received basic infantry training, learning the use of the Karabiners 98k, the Pistole 08, and the MG 34, before tank training on the Panzer I, Panzer II, and Panzer IV. On 1 October 1940, he was transferred to the 3rd Company of the 29th Panzer Regiment, 12th Panzer Division. Knispel completed his training as a loader and gunner in a Panzer IV. Training lasted until 11 June 1941 and consisted of courses at Sagan and Putlos.
World War II.
Knispel was the gunner of a Panzer IV under Lt. Hellman at the time of Operation Barbarossa, where he participated in the initial assault as part of Panzergruppe 3, LVII Army Corps (later LVII Panzer Corps), commanded by General Adolf-Friedrich Kuntzen. Knispel saw action from Yarzevo to the gates of Stalingrad, in the north around the Leningrad-Tikhvin area and also in the Caucasus under Eberhard von Mackensen. As of November 1942, a photograph show the now Gefreiter Knispel with the Panzerkampfabzeichen, the E.K.II, and the Verwundetenabzeichen in black.
Knispel returned to Putlos at the end of January 1943 and became familiar with the new Tiger I tanks. At this time, Knispel was credited with 12 kills.
From Putlos, a group of men was sent to the 500th Panzer Battalion at Paderborn. This group, led by Oberfeldwebel Hans Fendesack, was to become the 1st Company of the 503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion which fought at Kursk as flank cover for the 7th Panzer Division (Armee Abteilung Kempf). As per his biography, "Kursk hatte den Namen von Kurt Knispel im Battalion bekannt gemacht". Knispel saw further action during the relief attack on the Korsun-Cherkassy Pocket, Vinnitsa, Jampol, and Kamenets-Podolsk. Transferred from the east, the company was re-equipped with Tiger IIs and fought around Caen and in the retreat from Normandy. From there, the unit was transferred back to the Eastern Front and saw action around Mezőtúr, Törökszentmiklós, Cegléd, Kecskemét and the Gran bridgehead, Gyula, Nitra, Bab Castle (in one action, Knispel reported 24 enemy hits on his Tiger II), Laa and finally Wostitz, where he was fatally wounded together with another tank commander Feldwebel Skoda (Skoda was buried in Socherl). Knispel died in a field hospital in Urbau and was buried at a local cemetery. Ten days after his death, the war in Europe ended.
On April 10, 2013 Czech authorities confirmed that Knispel's remains were found among 15 other German soldiers behind a church wall in Urbau. He was identified by his dog tag. It is likely that he will be reburied at the military cemetery in Brno.
Legacy.
With 168 confirmed (possibly as high as 195) kills, Knispel was by far the most successful tanker of the Second World War and is even credited with knocking out a T-34 at 3000 meters, as well as the destruction of over 70 enemy Pak (anti-tank guns), and countless bunkers and field works.}. He fought in virtually every type of German tank as loader, gunner and commander. He was awarded the Iron Cross, First Class, after destroying his fiftieth enemy tank and the Tank Assault Badge in Gold after more than 100 tank battles. When Knispel had destroyed 126 enemy tanks (with another 20 unconfirmed kills), he was awarded the German Cross in Gold. He became the only non-commissioned officer of the German tank arm to be named in a Wehrmacht communique. As commander of a Tiger I and then a Tiger II, Knispel destroyed another 42 enemy tanks.
Though he was recommended for it four times, Knispel never received the coveted Knight's Cross, a standard award for most other World War II German tank aces. Unlike some other commanders, Knispel was not consumed by the pursuit of decorations and did not suffer from a "sore throat", Heer slang for those who lusted after the Knight's Cross. When there were conflicting claims for a destroyed enemy tank, Knispel always stepped back, always willing to credit success to someone else.
Knispel's slow promotion is attributed to several conflicts with higher Nazi authorities (for instance, he assaulted an Einsatzgruppen officer whom he saw mistreating Soviet POWs) and a perceived view by some historians of his general lack of military bearing, sporting a goatee and hair longer than regulations. As per Lt Colonel Alfred Rubbel, Kurt was always willing to help (immer gewillt zu helfen...) and friendly (freundlich).
Popular culture.
The online game, World of Tanks names a gunnery award after him.
Knispel's Medal (IV–I class) 
Awarded for the total amount of damage caused and received in four classes: Class IV - 10,000 HP, Class III - 100,000 HP, Class II - 1,000,000 HP, Class I - 10,000,000 HP.

Lionel Wartime Freight Train

The Lionel Wartime Freight Train, better known among collectors as the "paper train," was a toy train set sold by the Lionel Corporation in 1943. 
Origins.
During World War II, government-mandated restrictions on the use of various metals halted production of all metal toys in favor of the war effort. Lionel, seeking an alternative product to keep the brand name alive during the war, sought the assistance of Samuel Gold, a designer of various novelties including cereal and soft drink premiums. Gold made an agreement with Lionel and completed a design for an all-paper product train in March 1943. It was sold for a retail price of $1 for the 1943 Christmas season, but disappeared soon afterwards due to poor customer response. Lionel began manufacturing its conventional products again beginning in late 1945.
Features.
The paper train came in a flat box containing several sheets of heavy cardstock measuring 11 x 15 inches, on which was printed the various pieces of the set. The finished set included a steam locomotive, tender, boxcar, gondola, and caboose; all decorated for the fictional Lionel Lines. There were also three railway employees, a crossing signal, a crossing gate, and enough ties and rails to create a circle of track measuring 16 feet, 4 inches in circumference. In total, there were over 250 paper parts, 21 wooden dowel axles, and 42 corresponding pasteboard wheels. 
Although the set did well financially, the frustrating assembly process involved left many consumers dissatisfied. The train was designed to be put together without cutting pieces out yourself or using any adhesive whatsoever. Once finally put together, nothing kept the pieces from coming apart. As a result, the paper train overwhelmed many people, and often parents simply gave up on assembling the train and threw it out.
Current Value / Reproduction.
Today, original unassembled paper trains sell for around $300 in like-new condition, and up to $400 in perfect, mint condition. Greenberg Publishing Company of Sykesville, MD. offered a reproduction set in 1981. The reproduction can be distinguished from an original by examining the print - Lionel's model used four-color ink only, while the reproduction also makes use of regular black ink. Also the while the original set was die-cut so pieces could be easily punched out and scored for easy folding, the reproduction set is not pre-cut or scored. The reproduction set also did not include the wooden axles.

Daniel Glass

Daniel Glass is an American music industry executive whose output has included work with artists Billy Idol, Wilson Phillips, Sinéad O'Connor, Jon Secada, Warren Zevon, Blur, Goldfinger, Reel Big Fish, Erykah Badu, Baha Men, Kurupt, The Pretenders, Sugarcult, and, in 2007, the launch of Glassnote Entertainment Group artists – Secondhand Serenade, Justin Nozuka, Grammy Award winning Phoenix, Grammy Award winning Mumford & Sons, The Temper Trap, Two Door Cinema Club, Kele, Givers, Oberhofer, Little Green Cars, Daughter, Robert DeLong, Flight Facilities, Half Moon Run, Jeremy Messersmith, Foy Vance, Chvrches, Childish Gambino, Panama Wedding, HOLYCHILD, Tor Miller and Flo Morrisey. In 2011 Rolling Stone magazine named Glassnote "Best Indie Label." In 2013 Glassnote won the A2IM Libera award for Best Label of the Year.
Early years and the start of a music career.
Glass was raised in Brooklyn, New York. In 1977, while engaged in pre-med studies at Brooklyn College, he began a stint as an R&B/dance disc jockey at the college's radio station WBCR. Still a student, he was subsequently hired as the first DJ for the influential discotheque, Regine's. Over the intervening years he learned the record industry from the ground up. 
SAM Records.
Glass joined the influential indie dance label SAM Records as Vice President working with Gary's Gang, John Davis and the Monster Orchestra and the Evasions. He began focusing on developing artists’ careers, rather than just trying to pick hit records. Significantly, Glass promoted street bands when other more conservative and larger labels had not.
Chrysalis Records; Senior Vice President.
In early 1983, Glass moved to Chrysalis Records as Director of New Music Marketing, advancing later to Senior Vice President. During his six years with Chrysalis, he helped guide the careers of such stars as Pat Benatar, Huey Lewis and the News, Billy Idol, Spandau Ballet, Jethro Tull, Icehouse, The Divinyls, Sinéad O'Connor and Was (Not Was), among others. He also developed a strong college and intern program, which cultivated a number of talented young executives who later went on to high-level positions throughout the entertainment industry.
SBK Records/EMI Record Group; President/CEO.
In 1989, Glass became one of the first executives to join the newly formed SBK Records as Senior Vice President of Promotion, bringing his trademark aggressive, streetwise approach to the start-up label. This quickly produced success in breaking new artists, including the multi-platinum debuts of Jesus Jones, Technotronic, Wilson Phillips, Vanilla Ice, as well at SBK/Liberty country artist Billy Dean.
In 1990, Glass was promoted to Executive Vice President/General Manager of SBK Records. A 1992 edition of "Crain's New York Business" profiled him ("Daniel Glass, 35, General Manager EMI Records Group North America") as one of the top "under forty" business executives. With the consolidation of SBK, Chrysalis, and EMI USA several years later into "EMI Record Group North America," he rose to President/CEO. In that position he was instrumental in bringing Jon Secada, Selena, Barrio Boyzz, Blur, D'Angelo, Roxette, Wilson Phillips, Vanilla Ice, Technotronic, and Arrested Development into platinum and Grammy Award-winning status, as well as the hit soundtrack to the critically acclaimed film, "The Crying Game", which featured Boy George.
Rising Tide Records/Universal Records; President.
In 1996, Glass caught the attention of Doug Morris (later, chairman of Universal Music Group), with whom he started Rising Tide Records (subsequently Universal Records), with Glass as President.
The label had success in breaking new artists, including the multi-platinum debut of Erykah Badu, Billie Myers, Goldfinger, and the Lost Boyz. Recognizing the changing landscape of the industry, Glass strategically aligned Universal with such independent record labels as Kedar Entertainment, home to Erykah Badu, and Mojo Records, home to platinum artists Reel Big Fish and the Cherry Poppin' Daddies.
Artemis Records; President.
In 1999 Glass joined Danny Goldberg at the newly emerging label Artemis Records as Executive Vice President. After a few months, he was named President and achieved success with the gold record rapper Kurupt, Grammy-Award winning Warren Zevon, rocker Steve Earle, gold record female hard rock group Kittie, the Pretenders and the triple platinum pop stars Baha Men. He also executive produced the Josh Joplin Group’s album, which was released in January 2001.
Glassnote Records.
In 2007, Glass founded Glassnote Entertainment Group, encompassing a music label, publishing company and merchandising. The label's releases (with the exception of Secondhand Serenade which is through ILG) are distributed by RED Distribution in the United States. Among the artists signed to the label are Two Door Cinema Club, Grammy Award Winning Phoenix, Grammy Award Winning Mumford & Sons, Childish Gambino, Daughter, The Temper Trap, Little Green Cars. and Half Moon Run. In 2012, the sophomore release by Glassnote artist Mumford & Sons became the biggest selling debut album of the year with sales of 600,000 units.*
For the first release on the independent Glassnote Entertainment Group he chose Secondhand Serenade, the #1 unsigned artist in the history of MySpace, with 17 million plays and roughly 200,000 "friends." In 2013 Glassnote Records won the A2IM Libera Award for Best Label of the Year.
Insieme Publishing.
Glassnote Entertainment Group also encompasses InsIeme and Four Song Night Publishing, some of whose writers are Cara Salimando, Givers, Deap Vally, HOLYCHILD, Tor Miller and Brad Oberhofer.
Personal Life.
Daniel is the father of Sean Glass, noted DJ and founder of Win Records.

De Kleine Komedie

De Kleine Komedie is today the oldest theatre in Amsterdam, dating from 1788. Situated on the Amstel near the Halvemaansteeg, the building offers a stage for both upcoming and established Dutch talents. The theatre has 503 seats. 
History of the building.
The first theatre built in Amsterdam was the Schouwburg of Van Campen on Keizersgracht 384 in 1637, which burned down in 1772. That theatre company then moved to the Leidseplein, where it built a theatre in 1774, the first Stadsschouwburg. That building burned down in 1892 (the present building was built in 1894), making De Kleine Komedie the oldest surviving theatre in Amsterdam. 
In 1784 Henry Hope of Hope & Co. purchased ground on the Amstel near the east side of the Halvemaansteeg in Amsterdam, together with his fellow banker friends Balthazar Elias Abbema, Pieter de Smeth, Henry Fizeaux, Jean Alexander Botereau, and Pieter Muilman. They commissioned the building to the architect Abraham van der Hart who completed it in 1788. The commissioners were all very influential men of Amsterdam who had far reaching connections. Henry Fizeaux was a banker who had close ties with John Adams and Benjamin Franklin. He tried to raise funds for the American cause and shared revolutionary sympathies, though merchant tradition was to deny political preferences. The 'Patriotic' or 'Anti-Orange' sympathies of the directors Henry Fizeaux and Jean Alexander Botereau resulted in their stepping down in 1787 when the House of Orange was re-established. Orangist Henry Hope took over the running of the establishment until he fled the country before Napoleon's army in 1794. 
Théâtre Français.
It was called the Théâtre Français sur l'Erwtemarkt in 1784, the year performances began. In those days, the performances were often in French and modelled on a Parisian theater form that was very popular. Napoleon himself supported the Théâtre Français, and French opera's and plays were shown in the theatre well into the 19th century.
When the interest in French plays decreased, the building was sold to the 'Neues Deutsches Theater' that performed German plays. In 1856 the building came into the hands of the Free Church of Scotland and was rechristened 'Scottish Missionary Church'. The driving force behind the Dutch branch of this church was the Rev. August Ferdinand Carl Schwartz (1817–1870), the father of the novelist Maarten Maartens.
When the Vrije Universiteit (Free University) of Amsterdam started in 1880, it hired some rooms in the Scottish Missionary Church and used them as lecture rooms. Here the founder Abraham Kuyper and his four co-professors gave their lectures. In 1883 the Scottish Missionary Church became too small for the quickly growing number of students and the university bought another building.
In the first half of Twentieth Century the building was called Salvatori and was used as a meeting centre. The most various groups met here, from orthodox Protestants to leftist freethinkers. During the Second World War the building was no more than a bicycle shed.
De Kleine Komedie.
In 1947 the building was reopened as a theatre, now under its present name 'De Kleine Komedie'. Since then its program is primarily in Dutch. In the Fifties and Sixties many famous people in the Dutch entertainment world, like Toon Hermans, Wim Kan and Fons Jansen, made appearances in this theatre. In 1973 the building was closed by the Amsterdam fire brigade due to fire hazard. After a renovation financed by private sources, it was reopened in 1978.
In 1988 the continued existence of De Kleine Komedie was put in danger again, when the municipality of Amsterdam wanted to withdraw its subsidy. A campaign launched by the cabaret performer Youp van 't Hek secured the theatre's subsidy.
Because of its cosy atmosphere De Kleine Komedie is often used for try-out performances by upcoming talents as well as long-established cabaret performers. Many DVD and TV productions are recorded here.

Tilia heterophylla

Tilia heterophylla (White Basswood), is a species of "Tilia" native to mesic forests in eastern North America from central New York south to northernmost Florida and west to Missouri; it is most common in the Appalachian Mountains. 
Its primary distinguishing characteristic from other North American "Tilia" species is the presence of dense felt (tomentum) of white hairs on the underside of the leaves. It has often been considered to be a variety of "Tilia americana", as "Tilia americana" var. "heterophylla", though some others place it as a species in a separate section of the genus, more related to other European and Asian "Tilia" species with white tomentum on the undersides of the leaves, such as "Tilia tomentosa". The problem of its species status and placement in the genus is complicated by extensive natural hybridization with "Tilia americana".
Description.
"Tilia heterophylla" is a medium-sized to large deciduous tree growing to tall with a trunk up to diameter. The leaves are large, very unequal at the base, 7–19 cm (2.7-7.5 in) long and 6–14 cm (2.3-5.5 in) broad, with a finely toothed margin; they are light green and smooth above, and silvery downy beneath. The flowers, larger than those of "T. americana", are produced in clusters of 10–24 together. The fruit is spherical, diameter, downy, with the fruit bract pointed at the base.
The tree is not generally well known, but Professor Charles Sargent, in "The Silva of North America", says of it: "Few North American trees surpass it in beauty of foliage; and the contrast made by the snowy whiteness of the under surface of its ample leaves as they flutter on their slender stems, with the dark green of the Hemlocks and Laurels on the banks of rapid mountain streams produces one of the most beautiful effects which can be seen in the splendid forests which clothe the valleys of the southern Appalachian Mountains."
Uses.
The wood is called basswood, and not distinguished from that of other species of "Tilia".
The young leaves are edible, and can be made into a mild-flavored tea.

Log management and intelligence

Log management (LM) comprises an approach to dealing with large volumes of computer-generated log messages (also known as audit records, audit trails, event-logs, etc.). LM covers log collection, centralized aggregation, long-term retention, log analysis (in real-time and in bulk after storage) as well as log search and reporting.
Log management is driven by reasons of security, system and network operations (such as system or network administration) and regulatory compliance.
Effectively analyzing large volumes of diverse logs can pose many challenges — such as huge log-volumes (reaching hundreds of gigabytes of data per day for a large organization), log-format diversity, undocumented proprietary log-formats (that resist analysis) as well as the presence of false log records in some types of logs (such as intrusion-detection logs).
Users and potential users of LM can build their own log management and intelligence tools, assemble the functionality from various open-source components, or acquire (sub-)systems from commercial vendors. Log management is a complicated process and organizations often make mistakes while approaching it.
Lately, more and more the suggestion is made to change the definition of logging. This change would keep matters both more pure and more easily maintainable. 
Logging is technical information used for the maintenance process of applications or websites - either to define whether a reported bug is actually a bug, or to help analyze, reproduce and solve a bug, and even to help test new features in a development stage.
Deployment life-cycle.
One view of assessing the maturity of an organization in terms of the deployment of log-management tools might use successive categories such as:

Ricardo Caruso Lombardi

Ricardo Daniel Caruso Lombardi (born 10 February 1962 in Buenos Aires) is a football coach.
Playing career.
Lombardi started his playing career with Argentinos Juniors in 1981. His career was then mostly in the lower leagues of Argentine football apart from 1984 when he played a single season for Club Atlético Atlanta in the Primera Division.
In 1986 he was part of the Deportivo Italiano team that won the Primera B championship.
Managerial career.
After retirement, Caruso Lombardi took up coaching, initially in lower league teams. In the 1995–96 season, he won the Primera B Metropolitana (third division) with Sportivo Italiano, and in the 2004–05 he won it again with Tigre.
Caruso Lombardi was then in charge of Argentinos Juniors, until resigning five games into the 2007 Apertura tournament, despite his team's 3–2 win over Boca Juniors only three weeks previously. He was then hired by Newell's Old Boys, with which he obtained his second victory over Boca in the same 2007 Apertura tournament, beating them 1–0.
On 24 February 2009, Caruso Lombardi became Racing Club's head coach, signing a two year contract. He helped Racing avoid relegation in his first season; however, he resigned on October 2009, after coaching 11 games without a win in the Apertura tournament. After three years, on 17 December 2009, the coach returned to Tigre, replacing Diego Cagna.
Caruso Lombardi has a preference towards using physically tall footballers on all the positions of the field. In 2010, while coaching Tigre, he was accused by one of his players (Juan Camilo Angulo) of requesting a bribe to put him on the first team. The coach denied the truth of the accusations.
On 8 March 2011, Caruso Lombardi was appointed as head coach of Quilmes, with the club languishing at the bottom of the table and fighting relegation. It is expected that he would remain in that role until his contract expired in June 2012. After a successful spell at Quilmes, during the night of 3 April of the next season, he signed a contract with San Lorenzo de Almagro, replacing Leonardo Madelón in the charge, after their bad results.

St. Mary's Cathedral, Kilkenny

St. Mary’s is the Roman Catholic cathedral for the Diocese of Ossory. It is situated on James’s Street, Kilkenny, County Kilkenny, Ireland.
Saint Mary’s was designed by William Deane Butler (c.1794-1857). He was chosen by Bishop William Kinsella (1793-1845) who instigated the building of St. Mary’s in February 1842. Work began in April 1843 and finished in 1857, which included the period of the Irish famine. On Sunday 4 October 1857, St. Mary’s had its grand opening, which consisted of a two and three quarter hour ceremony that began at 6.15am. The cost of the building is estimated to have been £25,000.
St. Mary’s is made from cut-limestone which was sourced locally. The cathedral has a cruciform plan and its style is described as ‘Early English Gothic’. The design is believed to have been based on Gloucester Cathedral in Gloucester, England. It is situated on the highest point in Kilkenny City and is a significant local landmark.
The cathedral actually has three names - St Mary’s, the church of St Kieran and the Cathedral of the Assumption.
St. Mary’s has a noted sculpture of the Madonna by Giovanni Maria Benzoni (1809-1873).

HMS Defiance (1861)

HMS "Defiance" was the last wooden line-of-battle ship launched for the Royal Navy. She never saw service as a wooden line-of-battle ship. In 1884 she became a schoolship.
Design.
"Defiance" was a development of the "Renown" class. The second pair of "Renown"'s, and , had a modified, finer stern run. "Defiance" was originally laid down as to the same plan as "Atlas", but a new plan dated 8 October 1858 was prepared giving "Defiance" a lengthened bow.
"Defiance" was the last ship to use the midsection design that Isaac Watts created for .
Career.
Her trials off Plymouth on 5 February 1862 were conducted when she was neither masted nor stored. The trial speed of was worse than the similar trials of "Atlas" () and "Anson" (). However "Defiance's" lack of sea service means that there can be no certainty as to whether her design was an improvement on "Atlas".
On 26 November 1884 "Defiance" became the Devonport torpedo and mining schoolship. A special railway station to serve personnel travelling to and from the school, known as "Defiance Platform", was situated just west of Saltash railway station from 1905 until 1930.
She was sold on 26 June 1931 to Castle's Shipbreaking Yard for dismantling at Millbay, Plymouth. Doige's Annual for 1932 poignantly describes her as "the last of England's 'Wooden Walls'".

Northumberland (UK Parliament constituency)

Northumberland, was a County constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of England then of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1707 to 1800 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1832. It was represented by two Members of Parliament.
The constituency was split into two two-member divisions, for Parliamentary purposes, by the Reform Act of 1832. The county was then represented by the Northumberland North and Northumberland South constituencies.
Members of Parliament.
1640–1832.
Notes
Elections.
The county franchise, from 1430, was held by the adult male owners of freehold land valued at 40 shillings or more. Each elector had as many votes as there were seats to be filled. Votes had to be cast by a spoken declaration, in public, at the hustings, which took place in the town of Alnwick. The expense and difficulty of voting at only one location in the county, together with the lack of a secret ballot contributed to the corruption and intimidation of electors, which was widespread in the unreformed British political system.
The expense, to candidates, of contested elections encouraged the leading families of the county to agree on the candidates to be returned unopposed whenever possible. Contested county elections were therefore unusual. The Tory Percys, led by the Duke of Northumberland, shared the county representation with the Whig Grey Family.

Ernst Glaser

Ernst Glaser (1904-1979) was born in Hamburg but moved to Norway in 1928 to take up the post as concert master of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra after Max Rostal. The two had studied together under Carl Flesch, and when Rostal was offered a position as a professor in Berlin, he suggested Glaser as his successor.
In Oslo, Glaser worked as an orchestra musician, a soloist and a teacher. He also had solo engagements in Sweden, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Israel. He gave first performances to several violin concertos, including those of Olav Kielland, Klaus Egge and Bjarne Brustad.
Glaser fled the Shoah in Norway in 1942 by finding his way to Sweden.
Glaser returned to Norway in 1945 and stayed in the position as concert master of the Oslo Philharmonic until 1969, only interrupted by 3 years of living in exile.
Ernst Glaser performed frequently with his wife, the pianist Kari Aarvoll Glaser, and together they also made recordings. Some of these have recently put Ernst Glaser in the focus again, with the publication of the first volume of a series of historic recordings, “Great Norwegian Performers 1945-2000” (Simax PSC1830, 2006).
Ernst Glaser is the father of the pianist Liv Glaser and the cellist Ernst Simon Glaser, both famous Norwegian classical musicians.

Jim Zumbo

Jim Zumbo is a firearms and hunting commentator and writer. Until February 2007, he was the hunting editor for "Outdoor Life" magazine and host of the television program "Jim Zumbo Outdoors" on The Outdoor Channel. He was removed from both positions after he criticized the use of semi-automatic rifles such as the AR-15 and AK-47 for hunting in his blog. On July 3, 2007 Zumbo's TV show went back on the air.
Career and interests.
Zumbo holds degrees in forestry and wildlife biology. Before becoming a writer, he worked as a forester and wildlife biologist for 15 years. He wrote his first article for "Outdoor Life" in 1962, and became a full-time employee of the magazine in 1978. His main focus is on big game hunting. He has written 23 books and approximately 1,500 articles for outdoor magazines. Zumbo is also a lecturer on big game hunting and firearms for organizations like the National Rifle Association and a successful wildlife photographer.
"'Terrorist' rifles" blog entry.
On February 16, 2007, Zumbo published an entry on his blog which read, in part:
I must be living in a vacuum. The guides on our hunt tell me that the use of AR and AK rifles have a rapidly growing following among hunters, especially prairie dog hunters. I had no clue. Only once in my life have I ever seen anyone using one of these firearms.
I call them "assault" rifles, which may upset some people. Excuse me, maybe I'm a traditionalist, but I see no place for these weapons among our hunting fraternity. I'll go so far as to call them "terrorist" rifles. They tell me that some companies are producing assault rifles that are "tackdrivers."
Sorry, folks, in my humble opinion, these things have no place in hunting. We don't need to be lumped into the group of people who terrorize the world with them, which is an obvious concern. I've always been comfortable with the statement that hunters don't use assault rifles. We've always been proud of our "sporting firearms."
This really has me concerned. As hunters, we don't need the image of walking around the woods carrying one of these weapons. To most of the public, an assault rifle is a terrifying thing. Let's divorce ourselves from them. I say game departments should ban them from the praries and woods.
Many firearms industry lobbyists were outraged that Zumbo was publicly demanding an outright ban on a type of popular sporting rifle for reasons of "personal bias". In response to the flood of threatened boycotts, Remington Arms' CEO Tommy Millner fired Zumbo as a spokesman on February 19, The Outdoor Channel announced that Zumbo programming would be on a temporary hiatus, but did not sever their affiliations with Zumbo. His online blog was discontinued "for the time being" by "Outdoor Life" on February 19. "Outdoor Life" subsequently dropped him completely, stating on its webpage that Zumbo would no longer be contributing to the publication once the last of his columns already to press had been printed. Gerber Knives and Mossy Oak severed all of their business dealings with Zumbo as well, as did a majority of his other sponsors.
Outdoor columnist Dennis Anderson wrote in 2007 that "Zumbo's comments lent voice to what many hunters believe, namely that assault-style weapons are the black sheep of guns and do nothing to engender hunters and shooters to the general public."
Aftermath.
The speed with which calls for Zumbo's termination were acted on by his sponsors and employers (initial responses from sponsors occurred within a 36-hour period after he posted the first of two blog entries on the topic) were seen by many participants as evidence of the power of the Internet and of the "new media," including the "blogosphere," to influence and shape sociopolitical events. "The New York Times" published an editorial March 3, 2007 criticizing the destruction of Zumbo's career as overkill and avoidance of healthy debate.
Two weeks after the blog appeared Mr. Zumbo was invited by NRA board member Ted Nugent to an "education" session at Nugent's Texas ranch. Jim was lectured on the sporting uses of AR type rifles by Ted and two Texas outdoor writers.
On March 20, a month after Zumbo's column was published, gun control advocate Senator Carl Levin praised Zumbo for "his forthrightness, his honesty and his courage," calling the response to his comments "swift and callous," in a speech that supported the renewal of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. Zumbo in turn published "An Open Letter to the United States Senate", saying his statements had been misrepresented, and attacking Levin's support of gun control legislation as an attack on the Second Amendment.
Return to television.
According to Jim Zumbo's website, fellow hunter Ted Nugent came to Zumbo's rescue. After the blog incident, Zumbo flew to Nugent's ranch in Texas to learn about the so-called black rifles. Nugent wanted to use Zumbo's ignorance as an example of an avid hunter who was unaware of the popularity and uses of these firearms. Zumbo went on to work with the Second Amendment Foundation.
On July 3, 2007 Zumbo's TV show went back on the air, and some sponsors began coming back. Over the last few years Zumbo has been focusing on wounded soldiers who suffered severe injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan, taking them on all-expense paid hunting trips, with more planned in the future.
In August 2008, Zumbo was appointed as national spokesman for the Outdoor Recreation Heritage Fund, which is a branch of the Paralyzed Veterans of America.
Publications.
His books include "The Complete Hunter: Elk Hunting" (Creative, 2000).

Aspen Santa Fe Ballet

Aspen Santa Fe Ballet (ASFB) is an American contemporary dance company. It comprises eleven classically trained dancers.
In addition to its domestic and international performances, the organization has a presentation program called "Aspen Santa Fe Ballet Presents", with summer and winter seasons that brings touring dance companies from around the world to both Aspen and Santa Fe. The Aspen Santa Fe Ballet has two official schools, one in Aspen, one in Santa Fe, and a year-round Mexican Folk Dance outreach program in both Colorado and New Mexico.
History.
In 1995, at the invitation of Aspen Ballet Company and School founder Bebe Schweppe, Joffrey dancers Jean-Philippe Malaty and Tom Mossbrucker moved from New York City to embark on a vision of creating a professional dance company based in Aspen.
The company started modestly with six dancers. Growth was organic. Friends in the field – Gerald Arpino, Trey McIntyre, Septime Webre, Dwight Rhoden, offered start-up repertoire. Moses Pendleton's highly popular Noir Blanc was a seminal event for the young troupe. It launched a tradition of commissioning new work. An open, exploratory style emerged as Mossbrucker and Malaty tapped the creative scene in Europe where classical ballet was breaking from its boundaries. The athletic and adventurous American dancers found themselves at a crossroads of dance history.
In 2000 the company began a co-venture with a presenting organization in Santa Fe and now perform under the name Aspen Santa Fe Ballet.
Aspen Santa Fe Ballet (ASFB) made its New York City debut at The Joyce Theater in 2003 and has notably performed at Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival and Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts. In 2004 ASFB made its international debut in Canada and France and in 2013 ASFB made its debut in Moscow, Russia.
Education.
The School at Aspen Santa Fe Ballet includes a rigorous professional level ballet preparatory program, a critically acclaimed Folklorico program, as well as other community focused programs such as the Parkinson's Dance Program founded in 2013. The School at Aspen Santa Fe Ballet serves the communities surrounding the towns of Aspen, Basalt, and Carbondale in Colorado and Santa Fe, and Eldorado in New Mexico.
Students in the youth programs perform in annual spring recitals, and alongside ASFB's professional dancers in The Nutcracker. To ensure that every child who wishes to dance can do so, Aspen Santa Fe Ballet awards over $30,000 in needs-based scholarships every year. The Folklorico Program is largely free to participants.
Staff.
Bebe Schweppe, Founder, grew up in Augusta, Georgia, and started dancing at the age of 7 at Georgia Dance Theatre under Frankie Levy. At the age of eleven she was invited by Robert Joffrey to study in New York on a full scholarship. She moved to Aspen in 1975 and founded Aspen Ballet School in 1990, and Aspen Ballet Company in 1996.
Jean-Philippe Malaty, Executive Director, grew up in the Basque region of France. After receiving his degree in dance, he accepted scholarships to study in some of Europe’s most prestigious schools: MUDRA, Maurice Bejart’s school in Brussels, and John Cranko’s school in Stuttgart. At the invitation of David Howard, Jean-Philippe came to America to study at the David Howard Dance Center in New York City. Since then, Jean-Philippe has performed soloist roles with various companies throughout the country including Joffrey II, Los Angeles Classical Ballet, Ballet Hispanico of New York, and the Lyric Opera of Chicago. He has been recognized by the U.S. government as an artist of extraordinary abilities and was granted a permanent resident status.
Tom Mossbrucker, Artistic Director, started tap dancing at age four in his hometown of Tacoma, Washington. At age 14 he began his ballet studies with Jo Emery, and performed with her company, the Tacoma Performing Dance Company. His studies continued in New York at the School of American Ballet and the Joffrey Ballet School. He danced with Joffrey II before joining the Joffrey Ballet, where he performed principal roles in over 70 ballets, and toured throughout the world. His favorite roles include those performed in "Billy the Kid", "Rodeo", "Romeo and Juliet", and "The Nutcracker". He has appeared in television specials, and was featured in the Joffrey’s Billboards, a full-length rock ballet set to music by Prince, which was released on videocassette.

<doc id="9655229" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9655229" title="Huaiyin–Huai'an Campaign">
Huaiyin–Huai'an Campaign

The Huaiyin-Huai'an Campaign (两淮战役) was a campaign consisted of several battles fought between the nationalists and the communists during the Chinese Civil War in the immediate post-World War II era, and resulted in communists taking the city of Huaiyin and the city of Huai'an. Sometimes this campaign is separated into two by the communists as Huaiyin Campaign (淮阴战役) and Huai'an Campaign (淮安战役) respectively.
Prelude.
Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also rooted from the fact that Chiang Kai-shek had realized that his nationalist regime simply had neither the sufficient troops nor enough transportation assets to deploy his troops into the Japanese-occupied regions of China. Unwilling to let the communists who had already dominated most of the rural regions in China to further expand their territories by accepting the Japanese surrender and thus would consequently control the Japanese occupied regions, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Japanese and their turncoat Chinese puppet regime not to surrender to the communists and kept their fighting capabilities to “maintain order” in the Japanese occupied regions, fighting off the communists as necessary, until the final arrivals and completion of the deployment of the nationalist troops. As a result, most members of the Japanese puppet regimes and their military forces rejoined the nationalists.
However, these former nationalists turned Japanese puppet regime forces were not from Chiang Kai-shek’s own clique, but instead, they were mainly consisted of troops of warlords who were only nominally under the Chiang Kai-shek’s before World War II, since they were nationalists in name only and mostly maintained their independence. These warlords were only interested in keeping their own power and defected to the Japanese side when Japanese invaders offered to let them keep their power in exchange for their collaborations. After World War II, these forces of former Japanese puppet regimes once again returned to the nationalist camp for the same reason they defected to the Japanese invaders. Obviously, it was difficult for Chiang to immediately get rid of these warlords for good as soon as they surrendered to Chiang and rejoined nationalists, because such move would alienate other factions within the nationalist ranks, and these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords could still help the nationalists to gain more territories by holding on to what was under their control until Chiang completed the deployment of his own troops to take over. Chiang Kai-shek’s objective was to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, which proved to be an extremely fatal mistake for him and his nationalist regime later on, as shown in this conflict.
Nationalist Strategy.
In accordance with his strategy to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, Chiang Kai-shek and his followers had hoped that these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords who rejoined the nationalists would be able to hold on to the regions long enough for Chiang to deploy his own troops by holding off communists. If the communists were victorious in such conflicts, however, the result would still benefit to Chiang and China because the power of these warlords would be reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists, and the warlord problem plagued China for so long could thus be greatly reduced, while at the same time, communists would be weakened by the fights and Chiang's own troops would have easier time to take control.
For the former nationalist turned Japanese puppet regime forces, these warlords and their troops had no problem of following Chiang Kai-shek’s orders, and they were eager to prove themselves. These warlords and their troops were well aware that due to the collaboration with the Japanese invaders during the Second Sino-Japanese War, they were well hated by the general population in China, including those nationalists who refused to surrender to the enemy and fought the enemy until the eventual victory. Therefore, in the impending demilitarization after World War II, they were certainly be disarmed and discharged, which would probably be the best outcome and the power of these warlord would be reduced or even completely eliminated as a result. Chiang Kai-shek’s ordering them not surrendering to the communists and fighting off the communists was a savior for them because by carrying out such orders, these warlords and their troops could legitimize themselves and thus retain their power by fighting the communists who were targeted as rebels by Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist regime.
Communist Strategy.
The communist strategy was much simpler than that of the nationalists because there was not any huge division within the communist rank like that of the nationalist. The communists already earned considerable popular support by being the only Chinese force left in the region fighting the Japanese invaders and their puppet regime after the nationalist withdrew, and after successfully establishing communist bases in the rural regions where better life was provided to the general populace in comparison to that of Japanese occupied regions, the general Chinese populace agreed that the communists were well deserved to represent the China to accept the invaders’ surrender in the region and takeover the regions occupied by the invaders.
First stage.
The communist 10th brigade of the 3rd Division of the New Fourth Army begun its push toward Huaiyin on August 26, 1945 from regions of Gaoliang Ravine (Gaoliang Jian, 高良涧) and Jiang’s Dam (Jiang Ba, 蒋坝), while five communist local regiments coordinated their attacks from other directions: the communist Sheyang (射阳) Independent regiment, Huaiyin Garrison regiment and Lianshui (涟水) Garrison regiment attacked Huaiyin from the east and north, while Huai'an was attacked by the communist Huai'an Independent regiment and the Eastern Lianshui (涟东) Independent regiment. After fierce battles that lasted four days from August 27, 1945 – August 31, 1945, all nationalist positions outside the city wall had fallen into the enemy hands and the city of Huaiyin was surrounded.
After besieging the city, the enemy force did not immediately attack, but instead, made preparations by building fire support stations and digging trenches that extended all the way to the foot of the city wall. The fire support stations were built by creating hills higher than the city wall with earth so that they would also serve as reconnaissance platforms and everything inside the city was under the attacking enemy’s surveillance.
Second stage.
After the nationalist defenders refused to surrender, the final assault on the city begun in the afternoon on September 6, 1945 at 2:00 PM. Taking the advantage of the trenches, the attacking enemy succeeded in approaching the foot of the city wall and set explosives to blow up a section of the city wall near the eastern gate. The nationalist was unable to stop the enemy from rushing in from the collapsed section and after one and half hour fierce battle, the entire nationalist garrison of Huaiyin consisted of the 28th Division and the Huaiyin Security Regiment totaling more than 8,600 men were annihilated by the enemy. Pan Ganchen (潘干臣), the commander of the nationalist 28th Division was among the 300+ nationalist defenders killed, and another 8,328 was captured alive, included the chief-of-staff of the nationalist 28th Division, Liu Shaoshen (刘绍坤). The enemy also succeeded in capturing 7 artillery pieces, 88 machine guns, and 6,592 repeating rifles from the nationalist. The last resistance ended at 5:30 AM next day on September 7, 1945.
After the fall of Huaiyin, the communist 10th brigade of the 3rd Division of the New Fourth Army turned its attention to Huai'an, besieged the city on September 13, 1945. Two days later, on September 15, 1945, the commander of the communist 3rd Division of the New Fourth Army, Huang Kecheng (黄克诚) personally led the 7th brigade and the 8th brigade of the communist 3rd Division of the New Fourth Army to Huai'an, replacing the 10th brigade of the communist 3rd Division of the New Fourth Army in preparation to attack the city with the help of local communist militia. Realizing their desperate situation, the defenders attempted to breakout on the dusk on September 21, 1945, but was beaten back by the enemy.
The assault on Huai'an begun in the morning of September 22, 1945 at 8:00 AM. Under the cover of heavy artillery support from mortars and infantry support guns which included captured Japanese Type 11, the attacking force succeeded in breaching the defense of the city, and the 12 metre high city wall proved to be incapable of stopping the enemy, which was breached within 5 minutes. By 10:00 AM, most of the defending force was annihilated. However, the remaining defense of a group of more than 200 ardent nationalists led by the nationalist brigade commander Wu Shuquan (吴漱泉) and the civilian commissioner Li Yunpei(李云霈) was much stronger than anticipated and it took attackers 5 hours to wipe out this last group of defenders and mop up the rest who went into hiding. The three-brigade strong nationalist defending force of Huai'an was completely annihilate by the attacking enemy with more than 300 killed, including the commander Wu Shuquan (吴漱泉), and another 4,350-men captured alive, while 5 artillery pieces, 52 light mortars, 50 machine guns and 3,738 repeating rifles also fell into the hands of the enemy. Along with the previous loss of Huaiyin and positions outside the two cities, the defenders lost nearly 14,000 troops, nearly the entire force.
Outcome.
Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also showed that Chiang Kai-shek’s attempt to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together proved to be a fatal mistake. Although the result of the campaign turned out exactly like Chiang Kai-shek and his subordinates had predicted, and consequently the power of the warlords in this region was indeed reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists, so that the warlord problem plagued China for so long was thus reduced for this particular region, and Chiang Kai-shek’s secondary objective was achieved here, any positive gains obtained by the nationalists were negated by the politic fallout. The reason was that this success of achieving the secondary objective came at a huge cost in nationalists’ loss of popular support in this region formerly dominated by the Japanese, because the local population had already blamed nationalilsts for losing the regions to the Japanese invaders, while reassigning these former Japanese puppet regime forces as the nationalist forces to fight the communists, the only Chinese force left in the regions, only further alienated the local populace and strengthened the popular resentment to Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist regime.
In contrast, the communist victory of taking the two cities resulted in the linking up of the previous four separate communist bases in central Jiangsu, northern Jiangsu, north of Huai River and south of Huai River. The political fallout of Chiang Kai-shek’s fatal mistake of attempting to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together also greatly helped the communists in gaining popular support in the region.

Two pass verification

Two-pass verification, also called double data entry, is a data entry quality control method that was originally employed when data records were entered onto sequential 80-column Hollerith cards with a keypunch. In the first pass through a set of records, the data keystrokes were entered onto each card as the data entry operator typed them. On the second pass through the batch, an operator at a separate machine, called a "verifier", entered the same data. The verifier compared the second operator's keystrokes with the contents of the original card. If there were no differences, a verification notch was punched on the right edge of the card.
The later IBM 129 keypunch also could operate as a verifier. In that mode, it read a completed card (record) and loaded the 80 keystrokes into a buffer. A data entry operator reentered the record and the keypunch compared the new keystrokes with those loaded into the buffer. If a discrepancy occurred the operator was given a chance to reenter that keystroke and ultimately overwrite the entry in the buffer. If all keystrokes matched the original card, it was passed through and received a verification punch. If corrections were required, then the operator was prompted to discard the original card and insert a fresh card on which corrected keystrokes were typed. The corrected record (card) was passed through and received a corrected verification punch.
Modern use.
While this method of quality control clearly is not proof against systematic errors or operator misread entries from a source document, it is very useful in catching and correcting random miskeyed strokes which occur even with experienced data entry operators. However, it proved to be a fatally tragic flaw in the Therac 25 incident. This method has survived the keypunch and is available in some currently available data entry programs (e.g. PSPP/SPSS Data Entry). At least one study suggests that single-pass data entry with range checks and skip rules approaches the reliability of two-pass data entry; however, it is desirable to implement both systems in a data entry application.

Portland Square, Bristol

Portland Square () is a Grade I listed square in the St Paul's area of Bristol.
It was laid out in the early 18th century as one of Bristol's first suburbs. Built upon a flat area of ground its central focus of St. Paul's Church. Shortly after construction started a number of the builders involved in the project became bankrupt, leaving much of the Square unfinished.
A variety of Georgian architecture designed by Daniel Hague was designed for wealthy occupants, although some has since fallen into disrepair or been converted from residential occupation to offices. It is laid out around a central gardens. The gates and railings of which are a grade II listed building.
Edward William Godwin, a famous Victorian architect, lived at Portland Square.
Architecture.
Many of the buildings now have Grade I listed building status.
Numbers 11 and 12 have been demolished however a major archaeological investigation was undertaken first. It showed that site of Nos 11–12 Portland Square consisted of two joined structures. On the western side along the street frontage, no. 11 was occupied by a Georgian House, with a courtyard to the rear. In 1877, no. 12 was converted for use as Young and Melrow's stay factory.
Numbers 31 and 32 are on the English Heritage Buildings at Risk Register and described as being in very bad condition.
Decline.
The area never achieved the fashionable cachet anticipated by the scale of the architecture and St Paul's church, being soon eclipsed by Clifton. Rather than the fine domestic residences planned by the developers, by the end of the 19th century there were many small business based around the square, particularly involving boot & shoe manufacture, and ancillary services for printing such as ink making and cardboard box making. By 1916 the Salvation Army opened two hostels for men and women in the area.
Bristol suffered from heavy bombing in World War II and Portland Square did not escape. A raid on 2 December 1940 killed 40 people and destroyed Dean Street, to the North of the Square. After the war, there was little interest in large Georgian properties and by 1951 the Ordnance Survey map described parts of the Square as "in ruins". Bristol's brutalist planning and development policies in the 1960s did nothing to repair this damage, particularly in the adjoining Brunswick Square. Unlike its neighbour, Portland Square did at least maintain its railed gardens and trees through the wartime scrap metal drives, which left the Square with some residual sense of coherence.
A gradual decline of St Paul's in general reached its nadir around the rioting of 1980. Both Portland and Brunswick squares developed a reputation for prostitution and drug-dealing.
Portland & Brunswick Square was first designated as a Conservation Area in 1974, with extensions to this in the years following. Despite this, little progress was made and the North West corner of the Square still required timber shoring to support buildings damaged by wartime bomb damage.
Redevelopment.
Bristol's generally booming economy in the 1990s encouraged some restoration and sympathetic redevelopment, initially on a small scale by individuals and businesses. "Cosie's" wine bar and the "Surrey Wine Vaults" were bohemian destinations for Bristol's vibrant nightlife, despite the area's threatening reputation – a reputation far less deserved in these main squares than in some nearby streets.
FTP which then became Galaxy Radio 97.2 The Hot FM was based at No 25.
One of the first major projects, the inspiration of its founding director June Burrough, was the Pierian Centre, a self-contained centre for training and self-development. This opened in 2002 in the Grade I listed No 27. The most visible development was in 2004, the opening of St Pauls church (closed in 1988) as the Circomedia centre of excellence for circus and theatre training.
Portland Square features in the BBC "Doctor Who" 2012 Christmas Special, "The Snowmen". Filming took place overnight on 21–22 August 2012. It stood in for central London for the bonfire scene in the "Sherlock" episode "The Empty Hearse".

Nine to the Universe

Nine to the Universe is the posthumous tenth studio album of American guitarist Jimi Hendrix, released in March and June 1980 in the United States and the United Kingdom respectively. It was the seventh Hendrix studio album released after his death and the third to be produced by Alan Douglas. The album contains five jam sessions, edited by Douglas. It only charted in one country – the United States – and even then only, briefly, reaching 127th on the Top 200 Billboard chart, before dropping out quickly. Various versions of the jams on the LP had previously circulated widely on bootlegs.
History.
"Nine to the Universe" is the third posthumous compilation Hendrix release produced by Alan Douglas. He had previously wiped almost all of the backing musicians from the original recordings and replaced them with session musicians on "Crash Landing" and "Midnight Lightning" and heavily edited (even significantly changing the tempo in some cases), overdubbing extended rhythm guitar, female backing singers, etc. on occasion. During his pre-release promo interviews/released statements, for his first release "Crash Landing", Douglas strongly hinted that he intended to release the jam session that Hendrix recorded with John McLaughlin, which would justify his loud claims that Hendrix intended embarking on a "new" jazz direction. But whether McLaughlin refused permission or not, it was never released officially and never could be as, when the jam was finally bootlegged, it proved that McLaughlin's semi-acoustic guitar's pickup was faulty and was nothing more that a rough jam. It was recorded during a later part of the session on March 25, that also featured Dave Holland (an English jazz musician who was then mostly known as Miles Davis' regular acoustic and electric bass player and his contribution to Davis' seminal post-bop/fusion albums between 1968 and 1970 - e.g. "Filles de Kilimanjaro", "In a Silent Way" and "Bitches' Brew") and Buddy Miles on drums. Instead, Douglas heavily edited, and released a number of disparate jam sessions (removing over 50% from each jam, apart from "Drone Blues" - which only lost a third - one of Hendrix' very first, new recordings with Billy Cox, who hadn't played with Jimi in three years and some young 'pop' musicians recruited from a club. ) recorded between March and August 1969, (mostly) retaining the original backing tracks and musicians.
Musical background.
These jams were recorded at a time when Hendrix had become acquainted with Miles Davis (Hendrix' girlfriend Devon Wilson had a close friendship with Miles' wife Betty Davis a funk, rock and soul artist), who had begun to "cross over" to jazz fusion with "In A Silent Way" (recorded February 18, 1969) which featured the English electric jazz guitar player John McLaughlin as well as bassist Dave Holland.
Hendrix had previously used a jazz influenced style from at least 1967, most notably on 'Up From The Skies' from "" and 'Rainy Day Dream, Away' / 'Still Raining Still Dreaming' from "Electric Ladyland".
Hendrix and Davis had discussed music and, it is claimed by Alan Douglas jazz producer, introduced by Devon Wilson who was already friendly with clothing designer Stella Benabou (then married to Douglas), that he, eventually, attempted arranging recording sessions with Davis and Tony Williams, with a view to a possible album. But this came to naught, again according to Douglas, through exorbitant demands for upfront cash from both Davis and Williams. Davis, from 1969, hired John McLaughlin, and latterly others who have been described as "sharing Hendrix's fascination with noise."
Hendrix recorded only once with Davis' sidemen Dave Holland and McLaughlin, and Larry Young, who was playing in "Lifetime" (as had McLaughlin, recently), but this was just an informal jam session on 25 March. Young was soon to record one track with Davis for 1970's "Bitches Brew" and four years later played with Carlos Santana and John McLaughlin on "Love Devotion Surrender". These three are the only artists involved in the recordings that are recognized as "jazz" artists, and only two of them are featured here, on one jam 'Young/Hendrix'. Buddy Miles along with ex-Buddy Miles Express bassist Billy Rich and Larry Young, later played on John McLaughlin's 1970 "fusion" LP "Devotion" produced by Alan Douglas and Stephan Bright. McLaughlin later complained that the production was poor, and that he was inadequately recompensed for his efforts.
Douglas and Bright were attempting to produce Hendrix' Band of Gypsies from early October until November 28 when Douglas (and therefore his employee Bright) resigned as producer, "citing his own busy schedule, constant pressure from Jimi's manager Michael Jeffery and Hendrix' own indifference." During his & Bright's month and half as Hendrix' producers, the only thing Hendrix considered "finished" was the basic backing track of "Room Full Of Mirrors", Billy Cox had voted with his feet, walking out of the sessions and going back to Nashville after a furious row with Bright, he was only coaxed back two weeks later. He said: "We were just goofing around during those sessions at Juggy, the atmosphere at Juggy's didn't allow Jimi to create. It was a lousy deal with a lot of bad vibes around. I had words with Alan's partner, Stephan Bright. I hated that guy with a passion. Jimi sensed it and nothing we did there ever worked out. I didn't think they were necessary. I didn't think they were on Jimi's level. They weren't needed for the production, Jimi was well equipped to do that."
Hendrix recorded many jam sessions over his career which were only loosely organized, often started late and even went on into the late morning. He also recorded several jams in clubs on his portable Teac deck, a notable one being with a very "out of it" Jim Morrison ranting obscenities, Jimi encouraging him to "sing" into the correct mic'. The jams that ended up on "Nine to the Universe" were not written, played, or recorded as individually named songs; with the exception of "Message ['from Nine' - there is no record of this part in the original title] to the Universe" (an early version of what would become "Message of Love," and which also contains the seeds of "Earth Blues", both songs he would record later that year with the same line-up, who had by then become the Band Of Gypsies). All song titles were made up during the production of the final album.
'Easy Blues' was recorded during the aborted August sessions at the Hit Factory with his short lived 'Woodstock' band (variously titled: 'Gypsy Sun & Rainbows'/'Band Of Gypsies'/'Sky Church')and originally featured a guitar solo by Larry Lee.
McLaughlin's recollection of the session, many years later (he only played for a short part of the session due to his semi-acoustic guitar's faulty pick up, which made a loud distorted buzzing and the volume of Jimi's guitar which almost drowned him out anyway): "We played one night, just a jam session. And we various other musicians that played played from 2 until 8, in the morning. I thought it was a wonderful experience! I was playing an acoustic guitar with a pick-up. Um, flat-top guitar, and Jimi was playing an electric. Yeah, what a lovely time! Had he lived today, you'd find that he would be employing everything he could get his hands on, and I mean acoustic guitar, synthesizers, orchestras, voices, anything he could get his hands on he'd use!... The music wasn't all that great, I'm sorry to say. I love Jimi, but the music wasn't that great. We played some good things. Just because it was my name and Jimi Hendrix' name is no excuse. Only since Mahavishinu came out was it transformed into something other."
Larry Young on the session: "I'm not quite sure why I was called, but I was real happy to do it. It was a lot of fun and very informal. Nothing was really planned. It was real loose"
Jim McCarty's comment on the LP: "None of that stuff was ever intended to be released. To me it was embarrassing. I'm sure that Jimi would have said, "You're out of your f...ing mind and never let it happen the recordings being released, not the actual jams happening. It was all about people trying to make a buck out of Hendrix." (i.e. Douglas and Warners who employed him and released the LP)
Musicians.
Musicians on this album besides Hendrix include: Jim McCarty from Buddy Miles Express on guitar, Larry Lee on guitar (his solo was edited out by Douglas. He was one of Hendrix' close early friends in Nashville and member of two of Hendrix' early R&B groups - the 'King Kasuals' and 'The Bonevilles', latterly Al Green's guitarist and musical director), Larry Young on organ (famous R&B & jazz organist, early contributor to "crossover" "jazz fusion"). Billy Cox (Jimi's early army buddy, musical partner and co-founder of their Nashville band the 'King Kasuals' - the band continued after Jimi left. Cox played many R&B sessions in Nashville and was a songwriter as well as the bassist in the house band of the pioneering R&B TV show (in colour) "The!!! Beat"), Dave Holland (famous jazz bassist, who played with Miles Davis amongst others), and Roland Robinson (not so well known, he played on several of Buddy Miles' later projects ) on bass, Hendrix regular Mitch Mitchell, Buddy Miles from Buddy Miles Express & (the almost unknown) Rocky Isaacs, of the, (not well known), pop group 'The Cherry People' (as was Al Marks - percussion), on drums, Backing vocals by Devon Wilson on "Message from Nine to the Universe" were wiped from the original recordings.
Percussionists Juma Sultan and Gerrardo Velez are featured on 'Easy Blues' but have been turned down in the mix until almost inaudible and an unknown tambourine player was dubbed on. Verified guitar effects include the Octavia pedal and Univibe.
Release history.
The album had been released in Brazil in late 1979 already on Warner-Elektra-Atlantic as "Message from Nine to the Universe", with a different cover and song order. It was released on vinyl in 1980 by Polydor (UK) and Reprise (USA). It did not chart in the UK, but in the US the album reached #127 and stayed on the charts for seven weeks. The album itself was never re-released, either on LP or on CD, but bootlegged versions of the unedited jams are available.
The complete and remixed versions of "Jimi/Jimmy Jam" and "Drone Blues" were featured on the 2004 Dagger Records release "Hear My Music". A complete, almost 21-minute version of "Young/Hendrix" was released on the 2010 box set "", while "Easy Blues" was issued on the 2013 album "People, Hell and Angels", making "Message from Nine to the Universe" the only track from the original album that has yet to be officially re-released in unedited form. However, a complete, almost 19-minute version of "Message from Nine to the Universe" featuring Devon Wilson on call and response vocals appears on the bootleg album "The Electric Church".

Magdi Wahba

Magdi Wahba (1925–1991) was an Egyptian university professor, Johnsonian scholar, and lexicographer.
He was born in Alexandria in 1925 the son of a high court judge (Mourad Wahba Pasha) and later cabinet minister. His mother had been educated at Cheltenham Ladies' College and Oxford University. The grandson of a Prime Minister (Youssef Wahba Pasha) he belonged to the Egyptian aristocracy of the time but was nonetheless a member of the communist party in his youth. He was a graduate of Cairo University and the Sorbonne where he obtained a Diploma in High Studies in International Law in Paris (1947). He decided to pursue his interests in English literature and went to Exeter College, Oxford University and received his B.Litt and D.Phil in 1957.
During 1957–1966 and 1970–1980 Dr. Wahba taught English literature at Cairo University, Egypt. During that time he started the Annual Bulletin of English Studies which later became Cairo Studies in English published by the Department of English Language and Literature. He continued supervising countless PhD students as emeritus professor. After his death, the English Department's library at Cairo University was named after him. 
He also served for four years between 1966 and 1970 as the Undersecretary of State to the Ministry of Culture for Egypt where he organized in 1967 the Cairo Millennium event to celebrate the millennial anniversary of the city of Cairo. The event is considered by many as one of the great cultural event to occur in recent Egyptian history. It included scholars from all over the world, including academics such as Bernard Lewis, notwithstanding his sympathies to Israel. 
His key contributions to literature include some of the only English translations of Egyptian authors Naguib Mahfouz and Taha Hussein. He also edited existing versions of the authors' works in English. He was a well-known scholar of Samuel Johnson, editing "Johnsonian Studies", which included the oft-referenced bibliography of Johnson by James Clifford and Donald Greene. Wahba introduced to the Arabic reader the first Arabic translation of Johnson's "Rasselas" in 1959 and Chaucer's "The Canterbury Tales" in 1984. He edited the commemorative lectures for the bicentennial of Samuel Johnson's death celebrated at Oxford University in 1986, published by Longman. In 1989, shortly before his death, he published an article in the Journal of Arabic Literature entitled "An Anger Observed" that summarized the anger and suspicion felt by the Muslim world towards the West. The article was shortly after translated into Arabic and widely seen among Muslim scholars as an example of how it is possible to understand the Muslim viewpoint and develop a dialogue between the Muslim world and the West.
Wahba produced several lexicographic works, including several English–Arabic dictionaries. His "Dictionary of Literary Terms", published in 1974 and re-issued several times, has become an important tool for scholars of comparative literature in the Arab world. In 1989 he published "Al-Mukhtar: a Concise English–Arabic Dictionary", considered as one of the most thorough dictionaries of its kind. The "Mukhtar" was followed by "An Nafeess", published after his death.
He was elected a member of the Academy of the Arabic Language in Cairo in 1980, as well as a member of the Institut d'Égypte (founded in 1798 by Bonaparte) and became its secretary-general shortly after. He was also an active member of the International Committee for Philosophy and the Social Sciences (CIPSH). While he shied away from political roles (he declined a ministerial position offered by President Sadat), he was a member of the Shura Council (Egyptian Senate), following the footsteps of his father and grandfather Youssef Wahba. He died in London in 1991 from Leukemia.

New Mormon history

New Mormon history refers to a style of reporting the history of Mormonism by both Mormon and non-Mormon scholars which departs from earlier more polemical styles of history. Rather than presenting material selectively to either prove or disprove Mormonism, the focus of new Mormon history is to present history in a more humanistic and dispassionate way, and to situate Mormon history in a fuller historical context.
Because it is a break from past historical narratives, new Mormon history tends to be revisionist. In many cases, the new Mormon history follows the perspectives and techniques of new history, including cultural history. Mormon historian Richard Bushman described it as "a quest for identity rather than a quest for authority". New Mormon historians include a wide range of both Mormon and non-Mormon scholars, the most prominent of which include Bushman, Jan Shipps, D. Michael Quinn, Terryl Givens, Leonard J. Arrington, Richard P. Howard, Fawn Brodie, and Juanita Brooks.
History.
The term was originally published in 1969 by the Jewish historian Moses Rischin in his article "The New Mormon History." 
Although Rischin coined the term, D. Michael Quinn dates New Mormon History as beginning in 1950 with Juanita Brooks’ publication of "The Mountain Meadows Massacre" by Stanford University Press. He notes, however, that it had been gaining momentum even before that, citing that B.H. Roberts—Church historian from 1901 until his death in 1933—“exemplified much of the philosophy later identified with the New Mormon History.” credits Leonard J. Arrington, beginning in the 1950s, with having "led the charge" of New Mormon History, with non-Mormon scholars Thomas O'Dea and Whitney O. Cross responding in kind with "less prejudiced and more informed monographs on Mormonism."
New History.
New Mormon History is but a reflection of the change in writing history overall that took root in the 20th century. Quinn states that “the New Mormon History includes all of the ingredients of the “new history” in America at large but has one crucial addition: the effort to avoid using history as a religious battering ram.” 
The new historical movement's inclusive definition of the proper matter of historical study has also given it the label "total history". The movement was contrasted with the traditional ways of writing history which particularly characterized the nineteenth century, resisting their focus on politics and 'great men'; their insistence on composing historical narrative; their emphasis on administrative documents as key source materials; their concern with individuals' motivations and intentions as explanatory factors for historical events; and their willingness to accept the possibility of historians' objectivity.
Differences from traditional Mormon history.
Quinn, referring to Brooks’ history of the Mountain Meadows massacre, states that New Mormon History began with her in that she “avoided the seven deadly sins of traditional Mormon history.” Quinn identifies these “sins” as:

Barium chlorate

Barium chlorate, Ba(ClO3)2, is a white crystalline solid, the barium salt of chloric acid. It is an irritant and toxic, as are all soluble barium compounds. It is sometimes used in pyrotechnics to produce a green color. It also finds use in the production of chloric acid.
Reactions.
Synthesis
Barium chlorate can be produced through a double replacement reaction between solutions of barium chloride and sodium chlorate:
On concentrating and chilling the resulting mixture, barium chlorate precipitates. This is perhaps the most common preparation, exploiting the lower solubility of barium chlorate compared to sodium chlorate. 
The above method does result in some sodium contamination, which is undesirable for pyrotechnic purposes, where the strong yellow of sodium can easily overpower the green of barium. Sodium-free barium chlorate can be produced directly through electrolysis:
It can also be produced by the reaction of barium carbonate with boiling ammonium chlorate solution:
The reaction initially produces barium chlorate and ammonium carbonate; boiling the solution decomposes the ammonium carbonate and drives off the resulting ammonia and carbon dioxide, leaving only barium chlorate in solution.
Decomposition
When exposed to heat, barium chlorate alone will decompose to barium chloride and oxygen:
Chloric acid
Barium chlorate is used to produce chloric acid, the formal precursor to all chlorate salts, through its reaction with dilute sulfuric acid, which results in a solution of chloric acid and insoluble barium sulfate precipitate:
Both the chlorate and the acid should be prepared as dilute solutions before mixing, such that the chloric acid produced is dilute, as concentrated solutions of chloric acid (above 30%) are unstable and prone to decompose, sometimes explosively.
Commercial Uses.
Fireworks
Barium Chlorate, when burned with a fuel, produces a vibrant green light. Because it is an oxidizer, a chlorine donor, and contains a metal, this compound produces a green color that is unparalleled. However, due to the instability of all chlorates to sulfur, acids, and ammonium ions, chlorates have been banned from use in class C fireworks in the United States. Therefore, more and more firework producers have begun to use more stable compound such as barium nitrate and copper carbonate.
Environmental Hazard.
Barium chlorate is toxic to humans and can also harm the environment. It is very harmful to aquatic organisms if it is leached into bodies of water. Chemical spills of this compound, although not common, can harm entire ecosystems and should be prevented. It is necessary to dispose of this compound as hazardous waste.

California Vehicle Code

The California Vehicle Code contains almost all statutes relating to the operation, ownership and registration of vehicles (including bicycles) in the state of California in the United States. It also contains statutes concerning the California Department of Motor Vehicles and the California Highway Patrol.
The Vehicle Code includes various criminal law sections relating to the theft and misuse of motor vehicles. The Vehicle Code is one of 29 codes containing general statutes adopted by the California legislature and that have either been signed into law by the governor or that have become law without the governor's signature.
History.
The Motor Vehicle Act of 1913 made driver's licenses mandatory for all motor vehicle operators in California as of December 31, 1913. That law as well as the Vehicle Acts of 1915 and 1923 were codified into the first version of the Vehicle Code in 1935. In 1959, the California State Legislature recodified the Vehicle Code (meaning that it was reorganized for clarity and numerous sections were renumbered). Among other things, the code specifies weight and height restrictions for vehicles in certain zones, such as on freeways.

Trinidad and Tobago Cup

The Trinidad and Tobago Cup, or commonly known as the FA Trophy, is the premier knockout tournament for teams in Trinidad and Tobago that is open to all clubs affiliated with the Trinidad and Tobago Football Association. The FA Trophy is the oldest football competition in Trinidad and Tobago, dating back to 1927 when Shamrock claimed the inaugural trophy. Since the competition involves clubs of all standards playing against each other, there is the possibility for 'giant-killers' from the lower divisions of eliminating top clubs from the tournament and even theoretically win the trophy, although lower division teams rarely reach the final.
The trophy is currently contested each December through March following the National Super League season and the first round of matches in the TT Pro League. The current holders of the FA Trophy are W Connection, who defeated fellow Pro League side Central FC in the 2013–14 final on 18 December 2013.
Format.
The competition is a knockout tournament with pairings for each round drawn at random – there are no seeds, and the draw for each round is not made until after the scheduled dates for the previous round. The draw also determines which teams will play at home.
Each tie is played as a single leg. If a match is drawn after regulation time, then the match is determined by extra time and a penalty shootout, as required. Until the 1990s, a draw would result in the match being replayed two or three days after the original game. In the result of a drawn replay, extra time and penalty shootouts were used to determine the winner. However, beginning in 1999 each match is decided in its current format.
There are a total of six rounds in the competition – first, second, and third rounds, followed by the quarterfinals, semifinals, and the final. The competition begins in December with the first round where eight teams are entered into the competition. The remaining teams enter the FA Trophy in the second round. Each round is contested until the champion has been decided by single-elimination. Along with presented the trophy, the winning team also receives 23 gold medals and the runners-up receive 23 silver medals following the competition.
The draw.
The draw for each round, performed by drawing numbered balls from a bag, is a source of great interest to clubs and their supporters. Sometimes two top clubs may be drawn against each other in the early rounds, removing the possibility of them meeting in the final. Lower-ranked clubs with reputations as 'giant-killers' look forward to meeting a top team. Top-ranked teams look for easy opposition, but have to be on their guard against 'giant-killers' and lower teams with ambition.
Eligible teams.
All clubs in the TT Pro League are automatically eligible and the top six clubs following the league season in the National Super League are also eligible to enter the competition. Clubs from the six regional football association leagues that consist the third level of the football pyramid are also eligible. However, qualification is determined by the club's respective regional football association and narrowed to the top three clubs from each league. All clubs entering the competition must have a suitable stadium.
The number of entrants increased from 32 to 36 beginning with the 2011–12 edition. The Trinidad and Tobago Football Association decided to include the top four teams from the Secondary Schools Football League to provide youth players an opportunity to compete with professional and semi-professional clubs. By comparison, the other major Trinidad and Tobago domestic cup, the First Citizens Cup, involves only the members of the TT Pro League.
Trophy.
There have been 35 different trophy winners with Malvern United and Maple Club claiming the most titles with seven each.
At the end of the final, the winning team is presented with a trophy, also known as the "FA Trophy", which they hold until the following year's final. Individual members of the teams playing in the final are presented with winners' and runners'-up medals. The present FA Trophy has been used since the inception of the tournament in 1927. Following the awarding of the winners' medals, the trophy is presented by President of the Trinidad and Tobago Football Association to the winning team's captain.
Eight clubs have won consecutive FA Trophies: Everton (1929–32), Colts (1944–45), United British Oilfields Trinidad (1950–51), Malvern United (1960–61), Maple Club (1970–72), ASL Sports Club (1982–83), W Connection (1999–2000), and Caledonia AIA (2012–13). However, there has not been any clubs to win consecutive FA Trophies on more than one occasion. With the start of the League Cup in 1997, there has not been any clubs that have won the FA Trophy as part of a League and Cup double. In 1985, Defence Force added the 1985 Champions' Cup crown to their double, an accomplishment known as the continental treble.
Winners from outside the top flight.
Since the debut of professional teams into the competition in 1999, clubs from the former Professional Football League (PFL) and the current TT Pro League have won the cup in all but one of those years. WASA of the Super League were surprise winners in 2006, defeating two professional clubs, including the North East Stars 4-2 on penalties after the championship match ended drawn 3–3. In fact, WASA remains the only club to win the trophy from outside the top flight since the introduction of professional clubs.
There has been only one other occurrence of a team outside to the professional ranks to reach the final. In 2001, Carib from the Eastern FA, reached the final after defeating North East Stars and Police of the PFL. However, Carib fell to their third professional opponent, Joe Public, in the final.

Transuranic waste

Transuranic waste (TRU) is, as stated by U.S. regulations and independent of state or origin, waste which has been contaminated with alpha emitting transuranic radionuclides possessing half-lives greater than 20 years and in concentrations greater than 100 nCi/g (3.7 MBq/kg).
Elements having atomic numbers greater than that of uranium are called transuranic. Elements within TRU are typically man-made and are known to contain americium-241 and several isotopes of plutonium. Because of the elements' longer half-lives, TRU is disposed of more cautiously than low level waste and intermediate level waste. In the U.S. it is a byproduct of weapons production, nuclear research and power production, and consists of protective gear, tools, residue, debris and other items contaminated with small amounts of radioactive elements (mainly plutonium).
Under U.S. law, TRU is further categorized into "contact-handled" (CH) and "remote-handled" (RH) on the basis of the radiation field measured on the waste container's surface. CH TRU has a surface dose rate not greater than 2 mSv per hour (200 mrem/h), whereas RH TRU has rates of 2 mSv/h or higher. CH TRU has neither the high radioactivity of high level waste, nor its high heat generation. In contrast, RH TRU can be highly radioactive, with surface dose rates up to 10 Sv/h (1000 rem/h).
The United States currently permanently disposes of TRU generated from defense nuclear activities at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, a deep geologic repository.
Other countries do not include this category, favoring variations of High, Medium/Intermediate, and Low Level waste.
'"Transuranics into waste 
and fission products into recycled fuel"' 
Chemical elements contains 11 transuranic actinide elements, with atomic numbers ranging from 93 to 103. An element is defined by its atomic number, the number of protons in the atomic nucleus. Nuclei with the same atomic number but different numbers of neutrons are isotopes of the same element. The number of possible isotopes that have been attested in the laboratory is listed in the table shown for each element. The mass number of an isotope is the total number of protons and neutrons. All of the transuranic actinides are unstable. For any element, the most stable isotope is the one with the longest half-life, or time until half of the original amount present decays. The possible decay modes of the most stable isotope include Alpha particle emission, which drops the atomic number by 2 and the mass number by 4; Spontaneous Fission (SF), in which the nucleus breaks into several fragments; Beta particle emission, which increases the atomic number by 1 but leaves the mass number unchanged; and Electron Capture (EC), which decreases the atomic number by 1 but leaves the mass number unchanged.

Trinidad and Tobago League Cup

The Trinidad and Tobago League Cup, or commonly known as the First Citizens Cup for sponsorship reasons, is the league cup style football competition open for Trinidad and Tobago teams competing in the country's TT Pro League. Similar to the FA Trophy, it is played on a knockout (single elimination) basis in September and October towards the beginning of each Pro League season. Unlike the FA Trophy, where 36 teams enter each season from the top three tiers of the Trinidad and Tobago football league system and the Secondary Schools Football League, only teams from the TT Pro League compete in the league cup. The knockout tournament was inaugurated in 2000 and is currently sponsored by First Citizens Bank. Although the league cup is one of the three major domestic trophies attainable by Trinidad and Tobago league teams, it is perceived as a lower priority than the league championship and the FA Trophy. The current theme is "No Room for Losers", with TT$80,000 to the winner and TT$20,000 to the runners-up.
W Connection is the most successful club in the league cup having won the competition six times, including five consecutive cup titles in 2004–08. Central FC are the current holders of the league cup having defeated Defence Force in the 2013 final.
History.
The competition began in 2000, under the name of the League Cup, with San Juan Jabloteh winning the inaugural tournament by defeating Defence Force 1–0 at Marvin Lee Stadium. In 2001, First Citizens Bank began to sponsor the league cup and was officially branded the First Citizens Cup. W Connection and Defence Force claimed their club's first cup title in 2001 and 2002 respectively. The "San Juan Kings" became the first club to win the title twice having won the league cup again in 2003. W Connection were crowned champions for five consecutive years in 2004–08. However, in 2009, Defence Force claimed their second title and their first trophy in six years with a 1–0 win over Joe Public. The "Eastern Lions" exacted revenge by defeating Defence Force 3–0 on penalties after the match ended 1–1 the following year in 2010 to claim their first league cup title. Caledonia AIA claimed two consecutive league cup titles in 2011 and 2012.
Format.
The competition is open to all clubs of the TT Pro League and is divided into three rounds consisting of single-legged matches. Along with the expansion of the league in 2003 and 2009, the league cup added additional rounds of competition to narrow the number of teams to eight before the quarterfinals. During the first ten years of competition, teams were seeded as determined by their league position at the time of the quarterfinal pairings announcement. However, in 2011, the competition underwent a major format change with the introduction of a group stage and knockout phase. The change was made due to having only six clubs able to enter the competition. Defence Force and Police were unable to compete due to being called into service for increased crime in portions of the country. The group stage featured two groups of three teams competing in a single round-robin. The top two teams in each round advanced to the semifinals of the knockout phase. However, the group stage and knockout phase would only last one season. Beginning in 2012, the competition returned to a knockout tournament with pairings for each round drawn at random. The draw for each round is held at the First Citizens corporate box at the Queen's Park Oval in Port of Spain and is not made until after the scheduled dates for the previous round. The draw also determines which teams will play at home. 
Matches in all rounds are single-legged played for 90 minutes duration, at the end of which if the match is still tied, a penalty shootout is used to determine the match winner. Although the current match rules have been place since 2008, the competition began with the quarterfinal and semifinal rounds played as two-legged encounters, whereas the final was decided by a single match. In 2004 each round was converted into single-legged matches played into extra time if the two teams were drawn following regulation.
Sponsorship.
The League Cup has been sponsored since 2001. The sponsor has been able to determine the competition's sponsorship name. The list below details who the sponsors have been and what they called the competition:

Trinidad and Tobago Pro Bowl

The Trinidad and Tobago Pro Bowl, or commonly known as the Digicel Pro Bowl for sponsorship reasons, is a knockout football tournament for teams in the TT Pro League. The competition is played during May following the conclusion of the Pro League season. The Pro Bowl began without a sponsor during the competitions's first two years. It was not until 2006, when Courts began providing monetary prizes, that the tournament had its first sponsor. Following a pullout by Courts after three years, Digicel became the new branding partner of the competition. The prize money for the winner, as announced by TT Pro League CEO Dexter Skeene, is determined by the players, the clubs and the communities. With this programme the communities are expected to adopt the clubs and pledge their support to them during the tournament. The prize money will be the amount received from gate receipts and TT$100,000, courtesy of tournament sponsors Digicel.
Beginning in 2012, the winner of the previous year's Pro Bowl will open the following TT Pro League season in the Digicel Charity Shield against the defending Pro League champion. In the case that the league champion also wins the Pro Bowl, then the Charity Shield is contested by the top two teams in the previous league season.
W Connection is the most successful club in the Pro Bowl having claimed the title three times. In fact, the "Savonetta Boys" are the current holders of the Pro Bowl after defeating North East Stars 4–3 in a penalty shoot-out in 2013 after the match ended in a scoreless draw.
History.
The tournament was dominated by San Juan Jabloteh and W Connection in its first four years. The Pro Bowl served as a continuance of the rivalry between the two clubs. Although the "Savonetta Boys" claimed the inaugural tournament in 2004 and winning again in 2007. The "San Juan Kings" secured the Pro Bowl title in consecutive seasons in 2005 and 2006 over their rivals. In 2008, Caledonia AIA became the first club besides San Juan Jabloteh or W Connection to claim the title. Joe Public became the second club in 2009 after defeating Caledonia AIA on penalty kicks. The "Eastern Lions" repeated as winners in 2011 before shortly afterwards withdrawing from the TT Pro League. The following year, Defence Force claimed their first Pro Bowl after a 5–2 win over Caledonia AIA in 2012.
Format.
The competition is open to all clubs in the TT Pro League and is divided into three rounds consisting of single-legged matches. 
During the first two years of the competition, eight and seven clubs, respectively, representing the Pro League entered the tournament. In 2006, with the expansion of the league to include ten teams, the Pro Bowl added the qualifying round to narrow the teams to eight before the quarterfinals. In 2009, the draw for the knockout tournament was based on club's finish in the 2009 season. The bottom four teams entered the tournament at the qualifying round and the top six teams were automatically entered the quarterfinals. However, with the contraction of the league to eight teams with the 2010–11 season, the qualifying round was eliminated and all eight teams now enter the competition in the quarterfinals.
Matches in all rounds are single-legged played for 90 minutes duration, at the end of which if the match is still tied, a penalty shootout is used to determine the match winner.

XMPP Standards Foundation

XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF) is the foundation in charge of the standardization of the protocol extensions of XMPP, the open standard of instant messaging and presence of the IETF.
History.
The XSF was originally called the Jabber Software Foundation (JSF). The Jabber Software Foundation was originally established to provide an independent, non-profit, legal entity to support the development community around Jabber technologies (and later XMPP). Originally its main focus was on developing JOSL, the Jabber Open Source License (since deprecated), and an open standards process for documenting the protocols used in the Jabber/XMPP developer community. Its founders included Michael Bauer and Peter Saint Andre.
Process.
Members of the XSF vote on acceptance of new members, a technical Council, and a Board of Directors. However, membership is not required to publish, view, or comment on the standards that it promulgates. The unit of work at the XSF is the XMPP Extension Protocol (XEP); XEP-0001 specifies the process for XEPs to be accepted by the community. Most of the work of the XSF takes place on the XMPP Extension Discussion List and the jdev Chat Room (xmpp:jdev@conference.jabber.org?join).
Organization.
Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors of the XMPP Standards Foundation oversees the business affairs of the organization. As elected by the XSF membership, the Board of Directors for 2013-2014 consists of the following individuals:
Council.
The XMPP Council is the technical steering group that approves XMPP Extension Protocols, as governed by the XSF Bylaws and XEP-0001. The Council is elected by the members of the XMPP Standards Foundation each year in September. The eleventh XMPP Council (2013–2014) consists of the following individuals:
Members.
There are currently 61 elected members of the XSF.
Emeritus Members.
The following individuals are emeritus members of the XMPP Standards Foundation:
XEPs.
One of the most important outputs of the XSF is a series of XEPs. Some have chosen to pronounce "XEP" as if it was spelled "JEP", rather than "ZEP", in order to keep with a sense of tradition. Some XEPs of note include:
XMPP Summit.
The XSF biannually holds a XMPP Summit where software and protocol developers from all around the world meet and share ideas and discuss topics around the XMPP protocol and the XEPs. In winter it takes place around the FOSDEM event in Brussels, Belgium and in summer it takes place around the RealtimeConf event in Portland, USA. These meetings are open to anyone and focus on discussing both technical and non-technical issues that the XSF members wish to discuss with no costs attached for the participants. However the XSF is open to donations. The first XMPP Summit took place on July 24 and 25, 2006, in Portland.

Cincinnati Strangler

The Cincinnati Strangler was the name given to a serial killer who raped, then strangled seven mostly elderly women in Cincinnati, Ohio between 1965 and 1966. The identity of the Cincinnati Strangler is commonly believed to be former cab driver Posteal Laskey.
During the killing spree there was considerable alarm on the part of many Cincinnatians, with locksmiths and hardware stores unable to keep up with the demand for locks. Despite being charged with only one murder, the citywide panic only abated after Laskey's arrest and conviction, when the killings suddenly stopped, thus supporting investigators' claim that they successfully found and jailed the Cincinnati Strangler.
Originally sentenced to death, Laskey's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment when the Supreme Court invalidated the death penalty in "Furman v. Georgia". In February 2007, Laskey was denied parole. The grounds cited by the Ohio Parole Board included the heinous nature of the crime, Laskey's prior record and the community disapproval of an early release. 
He would have eligible for parole again in 2017 at age 79 years old and was incarcerated in the Pickaway Correctional Institution. Laskey died on May 29, 2007 of natural causes, while still in prison. No one claimed his body and prison officials said he was buried in one of the State of Ohio's prison cemeteries.

Nollaig Ó Muraíle

Nollaig Ó Muraíle is an Irish scholar. He published an acclaimed edition of Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh's "Leabhar na nGenealach" in 2004. He was admitted to the Royal Irish Academy in 2009.
Life and career.
A native of Knock, County Mayo, Ó Muraíle attended National University of Ireland, Maynooth where he was a postgraduate student enrolled for a PhD. He was Placenames Officer with the Ordnance Survey of Ireland 1972-1993. He was Reader in Irish and Celtic Studies at Queen's University Belfast to 2004 and Senior Lecturer at the School of Irish, National University of Ireland, Galway from 2005. He is married to Tresa Ní Chianáin and has two children. He lives in Dublin.
Ó Muraíle and Mac Fhirbhisigh.
In 1971, at the suggestion of Tomás Ó Fiaich, then Professor of Modern History at Maynooth, Ó Muraíle began work on Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh's "Leabhar na nGenealach". This was continued under the direction of Professor of Old and Middle Irish Pádraig Ó Fiannachta.
Upon joining the Placenames Branch of the Ordnance Survey in late 1972, Ó Muraíle had already translated over one hundred pages, albeit from Eugene O'Curry's copy. Access to the autograph of Leabhar na nGenealach however remained difficult; only on 28 August 1979, at University College Dublin's new home of Belfield, was he able to begin transcription of the original, which he finished on 10 September 1981. It had taken a total of 88 sessions in UCD Special Collections Reading Room. Typing began in late 1982 and was complete by 4 September 1984. By early 1988, after much tedious work, the "Cumire" was also successfully in transcript. His PhD dissertation, submitted in September 1991 on the life, background and work of Mac Fhirbhisigh, was fully two volumes, totalling 1,086 pages.
Early in 1998, Ó Muraíle was approached by fellow Mayoman, Éamonn de Búrca, with an offer to publish his edition of "Leabhar na nGenealach". De Burca insisted on a full translation of the text into English (with the original Irish text on the facing page) in opposition to Ó Muraíle's wish to publish with Irish text only. De Búrca prevailed, and the book, titled "The Great Book of Irish Genealogies", was published in five volumes (vols. IV and V consisting of indices alone) in 2004, with 3,100 pages in a full buckram gilt presentation box. It remains Ó Muraíle's unique contribution to Irish scholarship.
Publications.
The following is a provisional list of Ó Muraíle's publications.

National Language Authority

The National Language Promotion Department ( — , ) (or Urdu Language Authority) was an autonomous regulatory institution established in 1979 to support the advancement and promotion of Urdu which is the national language of Pakistan. The status now has been changed to attached department. Initially it was aimed at creating a synergy between national and provincial governments and institutions for using Urdu language. However, with time, it expanded its horizons to include standardisation and linguistic aspects such as orthography and lexicography. It also provides recommendations for maximizing use of the language in all walks of life. In this respect, large amounts of legal and scientific documents are translated from English and other languages for publication into Urdu. These efforts have resulted in greater awareness of the language's potential as well as its localisation. Recently, the status and name of organization has been changed from National Language Authority to National Language Promotion Department. The National Language Promotion Department is now an attached department of Ministry of National Heritage & Integration.Renowned Short-Story Writer and Educationist Dr. Anwaar Ahmad was the last Chairman of the NLA, as the post has been converted to Director General (D.G).
Objectives.
The institution aims to facilitate the use and adoption of Urdu language in grammical Persian through publications and other reading materials for individuals and organisations. It also provides linkages for cooperation and collaboration among various academic, research and educational institutions for use of Urdu language and native languages of the country. Over the years efforts have also been made to promote and facilitate Urdu as an official and business language; as a Medium of instruction; and as a medium of expression in the country. Moreover, the development of Urdu software is also encouraged at various levels to become more distant from Hindustani.
Organisation.
The organisational structure consists of six divisions that include: Dictionary section ("Darul Lughaat"), Translations section ("Darul Tarjuma"), Literature section ("Darul Tasneef"), and Publications section ("Darul Isha’at") respectively. There is also a department of Urdu Informatics (اردو اطلاعیات) to carry out research in developing the suitable hardware and software for the use of language in electronic media. A dedicated library contains extensive resources on Urdu, and issues regular Urdu Bulletins.
Key activities.
The institution has published a wide range of general, scientific and technical dictionaries and an Urdu Thesaurus. Especially, the "Qaumi English-Urdu Dictionary" has been based on Webster's Dictionary. A vast amount of literature has also been produced to encourage reading habits among children.
In 1980, the Authority standardised the Urdu keyboard layout for typewriters based on Naskh script. Later on, with the arrival of the digital age, the layout was improved for teleprinters and Information processing. Subsequently, in 1998 efforts were initiated to standardize Urdu encoding, which resulted in the formation of "Urdu Zabta Takhti" (اردو ضابطہ تختی) (UZT). This development was inline with the efforts to cope with the emerging demands of Urdu applications from word processing to mega-scale projects such as Computerised National Identity Cards by NADRA and a number of E-Governance initiatives by the national government. In July 2000, UZT 1.01 was standardised for all kinds of electronic computing, communications, and storage. Based on this version, Urdu language support was incorporated into the Versions 3.1 and 4.0 of Unicode. Localization of Microsoft applications like Windows and Office in Urdu is also done by then NLA, now NLPD.

National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab

National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab was a United States Supreme Court case involving the Fourth Amendment and its implication on drug testing programs. The majority of the court upheld the drug testing program in United States Customs Service.
Background.
In 1986, the U.S. Customs Service imposed a drug testing program for "employees seeking transfer or promotion to positions having direct involvement in drug interdiction," required to carry firearms, or have access to classified information. The National Treasury Employees Union sued and alleged that the program was violative of the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable search and seizure. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled in favor of the government. The union then appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals ruling with regard to positions involving drug interdiction and firearms. The ruling for classified information was held over, as the Supreme Court determined that the U.S. Customs Service too broadly included employee groups who would not generally have access to high levels of classified information.
Decision.
The majority decision authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy upheld the constitutionality of the drug testing program, reasoning that the employees of customs service had "diminished expectation of privacy." Justice Marshall wrote a dissent in which he was joined by Justice Brennan; Justice Scalia wrote a dissent in which Justice Stevens joined.

Cassie Ainsworth

Cassandra "Cassie" Ainsworth is a fictional character in the television series "Skins", portrayed by Hannah Murray.
Characterization and creation.
Cassie is depicted as being eccentric and suffering from several mental disorders — most notably, anorexia nervosa — and multiple issues, including low self-esteem, suicidal ideation, and drug addiction. Murray described her character as...
The titular second episode of the first series and the penultimate episode of the second series focus on Cassie; the former focuses on her mental state and the latter focuses on her relationship with roommate Chris Miles (Joe Dempsie). The show's producers and writers described her centric episode in an interview with "The Independent" as being about "how she gets through her day without eating ... how she feels and what her tactics are", and campaigned to prevent any announcement of any counselling helplines during the episode's credits because they "didn't want a little preachy drama where everyone hugs at the end"; instead, the producers hoped that people would recognize their own faults in Cassie. One reviewer described Cassie as being "as pale as "Hamlet"s Ophelia and arguably twice as mad".""'
The viewer is reintroduced to Cassie five years after series two in "Pure", in which she is shown to have changed in many ways. Where before she was bubbly, cheerful and unashamedly quirky, she is now a shadow of her former self, appearing tired and withdrawn, living in a shared flat in London and working as a waitress in a café to make ends meet. She avoids social contact with her co-workers and flatmates, and refuses to take drugs when offered them (as opposed to her affinity towards them in the past), and secludes herself in her room.
Arc.
At the beginning of the first series, Cassie is recently discharged from hospital after a suicide attempt off-screen. Her best friend Michelle Richardson (April Pearson) arranges for her to take Sid Jenkins' (Mike Bailey) virginity at a party. Throughout the first series, Cassie develops an attraction to Sid, who unintentionally stands her up twice: after being unintentionally stood up in "Sid", she attempts suicide; and after Sid stands her up again to rescue his best friend Tony Stonem's (Nicholas Hoult) sister Effy (Kaya Scodelario) from overdosing, she decides to move to Elgin, Scotland. She postpones her plans after discovering Sid loves her; the first series ends with her meeting up with Sid on the night she moves away.
In the second series, Cassie is in a long-distance relationship with Sid; the relationship becomes strained when Sid begins to think Cassie has been unfaithful. After Sid's father Mark (Peter Capaldi) dies, Sid travels to Scotland to meet her as Cassie simultaneously travels back to Bristol to meet Sid. Frustrated at Cassie's disappearance and emotionally confused by his father's death, Sid begins a relationship with Michelle.
As a result of Sid's relationship with Michelle, Cassie becomes extremely promiscuous (with men and women) and mentally unstable: in "Chris", her actions result in her roommate Chris Miles (Joe Dempsie) losing his job as a junior property salesman and causes a significant amount of tension between him and his girlfriend Jal Fazer (Larissa Wilson); and in "Effy", she attributes her addiction to "mindless sex" to her failed relationship with Sid. After Sid becomes aware of her actions, he confronts her about her promiscuity, apologises for dating Michelle, and tells her he loves her.
Cassie's subplot in the last three episodes of series 2 focuses on her friendship with Chris. She and Sid are back together, and tells him she will "love him forever". However, she witnesses Chris suffering from two subarachnoid haemorrhages, the second fatal. She is traumatized and flees to New York City. There, she meets a kind young Iowan named Adam (Stephen Michael Kane), with whom she forms a strong platonic friendship when he offers her a place to stay in his apartment. He later leaves the apartment to find his ex-girlfriend at Cassie's suggestion and, distraught, Cassie gets a job as a waitress at Adam's old diner in Manhattan. The ultimate scene of the second series depicts Sid wandering through Times Square looking for her and ends with him turning to look inside the diner.
Cassie is revisited five years later in series 7 in a feature-length episode, "Pure""," where it is revealed that she spent the last few years travelling around America with a boy and she moved back to England, though she moves into a shared flat in London instead of heading back to her hometown. She works as a waitress in a café, and later discovers a website titled 'Oblivion', filled with candid shots of her.

<doc id="9656133" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9656133" title="Acetylene (album)">
Acetylene (album)

Acetylene is a 2005 album by The Walkabouts. The fieriest and the angriest album in their history.
The content of the songs.
A scathing, furious attack on the George W. Bush government and its foreign policy, it opens up with 'Fuck Your Fear', a slow grinding barrage of distorted, hazy guitars and pounding, tolling-bell drums. Eckman and Torgerson's joint vocals describe a world teetering on the abyss in which the 60's hippy dream has long gone rotten ("Dead folksingers lie in state/Acolytes scrape off their plates/The message falls onto deaf ears") and death comes quickly and in abundance ("New gravediggers born each day").
The second track 'Coming Up for Air' turns its attention on the environment and whips together heavy jangles of guttural guitar chord and klaxoning keyboards with grinding slithers of Wells' bass and more of Moeller's funereal drum beats. With an urgent Eckman this time singing on his own, it tells of the Latin American poor forced to work as cheap labour in mines that have long since been rendered poisonous and unsafe. ("Suckin' alabaster in a ventilator shaft/Chewin' on surrender because it's cheap and it lasts/This ain't hell, it's a holdin' tank"). Outside though the air is no fresher and similarly polluted ("I know this tunnel leads outside/Down to the river where the elephants die").
Later on, the distorted, detuned 'Kalishnikov' portrays the "closed circuit silence" and horror world of two Third World refugees, who are herded from one transit camp into the next ("They're bulldozing the suburbs down/Putting up a razor fence"), but whose guards are also trapped and imprisoned ("The commando squad/is bored and poorly fed/Surveillance is their dog/And it's hounding us to death"). 
As 'Acetylene' seers towards its conclusion, Eckman's lyrics become increasingly futuristic. The penultimate track, the gusting, discordant 'Before This City Wakes', finds its narrator wandering around a dying city of the near future which, as law and order totally breaks down, has slid into complete chaos and moral hell (" So many victims of pleasure/That I've stopped counting")
By the time of the final song, the nine minute 'The Last Ones', the apocalypse has come. After all the thunder and discordance of the previous nine songs, 'The Last Ones' in contrast is soft and elegiac. Ebbing guitars revolve and rotate against a backdrop of eerie atmospherics from Slater and Moeller. Eckman and Torgerson, both singing together, are two of the last survivors, dreamily wanting to head home, even though there is no home left ("We'll be headed home/Heaven knows/There was no place for us to go").
Track listing.
All songs by Chris Eckman.

Melvin Vaniman

Chester Melvin Vaniman (1866-1912) was an American photographer, adventurer and businessman who specialized in panoramic images taken from heights. Born to a farming family in Virden, Illinois, he was the eldest of four sons, and attended Valparaiso University in Indiana and Chicago. His nickname was the "Acrobatic Photographer." He shot images from gas balloons, ships masts, tall buildings and even a home-made 30 meter pole. He was a famous aviator and balloonist. He scaled buildings, hung from self-made slings, and scaled dangerous heights to capture his unique images.
Vaniman's photographic career began in Hawaii in 1901 and ended some time in 1904. He spent over a year photographing Australia and New Zealand on behalf of the Oceanic Steamship Company, creating promotional images for the company. During this time the New Zealand Government also commissioned some panoramic images. Beginning in 1903 he spent over a year photographing Sydney and the surrounding areas. It was during this time that he created his best known work, the panorama of Sydney, shot from a hot air balloon he had specially imported from the United States.
He constructed his own "swing-lens" cameras to accomplish the capture of full 360×180 degree panoramic images.
Vaniman is best known for his images of Hawaii, Australia, and New Zealand.
Airships and death.
Some time around 1904 he gave up photography and took up exploration. This included attempts at the North Pole and the Trans-Atlantic crossing - both attempted in Walter Wellman's airship "America". At the first attempt to cross the Atlantic in 1910 they anticipated a five day crossing but the airship's motor failed after 38 hours leaving it adrift until it was rescued two days later by the "Trent", a passing Royal Mail steamship.
Vaniman lost his life during his second attempt at a trans-Atlantic airship crossing when his airship, the "Akron", exploded off the New Jersey shore on July 2, 1912. Filled with 11,300 cubic meters of hydrogen gas, his was the first American airship that could compare to the better known European manufactured models. Vaniman and his crew of four were killed when the airship exploded in front of the gathered crowd near Atlantic City, and gondola plunged 750 meters into an inlet. The other victims were his brother Calvin Vaniman, Fred Elmer, George Bourtillion, and Walter Guest. Subsequent investigation indicated that internal pressure had split the bag.
The State Library of New South Wales has the world's most extensive collection of his panoramas.

David Monrad Johansen

David Monrad Johansen (November 8, 1888 – February 20, 1974) was a Norwegian composer.
He was born in Vefsn and grew up near Mosjøen, where he received his first piano lessons. He came to Christiania (Oslo) in 1904 to study at the conservatory there, and he continued taking lessons with Catharinus Elling, Iver Holter and others until he went to Berlin in 1915 for further studies. In 1920, he went for a study trip to Paris, and here Stravinsky’s music came to make a huge impression on him. In addition he met Fartein Valen, which inspired him to start studying dissonant counterpoint. Later, in 1933 and 1935, he spent short periods abroad for further studies. Monrad Johansen’s study time was extraordinary diverse, and his development was affected by this.
It is difficult to categorise his style, with all the different influences that he went through. Before Berlin, he was within the conservative late romanticism, clearly influenced by Edvard Grieg. After Berlin, under the influence of Alf Hurum, he started studying the French Impressionist music, and around 1920 this style is apparent in his music. This was also a very productive period. At the same time, he was influenced by the nationalistic style. He several times used lyrics from Norse literature or Norwegian folk stories/songs, but seldom melodies. He did, however, arrange some folk tunes for piano (opus 9 and 10).
Monrad Johansen’s most famous piece is "Voluspaa" op. 15 (1926). It was composed for soloists/vocals, choir and orchestra, and it’s based on the poem Voluspaa, from the Edda. This piece and the "Nordlands Trompet" op. 13, are the most pure nationalistic of Monrad Johansen’s works, and often called a Norwegian impressionism. Regarding sound, they are related to impressionism, but have structures with more polyphonic features than what was common in f. ex. Debussy’s impressionistic pieces. The basis for the music, which is clearly tonal, has modal features. Dorian, Phrygian and Lydian scales are often apparent.
Even though Monrad Johansen had achieved significant recognition with these pieces, it was clear to him that the style was a dead-end, and the following pieces show a composer on a stylistic search. Then, during the studies in 1933 and 1935, he turned more into a neo-classical direction, more polyphonic, more clear tonality, classical forms – also more clear sound and colours, and fewer dissonances than in the 1930s.
Monrad Johansen had a very central position in Norwegian music life in the 1920s and 1930s. He was the leading person within the musical nationalism around 1925, after having achieved great recognition with the 7 songs to old Norwegian folk stories (opus 6) and the piece for male choir, "Draumkvedet", opus 7. This position was strengthened when he got the artist's grant (from 1925).
During the German occupation of Norway in the course of World War II, Johansen supported the collaborationist government of Vidkun Quisling, and during the period of 1942-1945 was a member of the Nazi-appointed Kulturting (Cultural Council).
David Monrad Johansen's son was the composer Johan Kvandal.

<doc id="9656220" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9656220" title="Stripe rust (barley)">
Stripe rust (barley)

Stripe rust is a fungal disease of barley caused by "Puccinia striiformis" f. sp. "hordei". It was first detected in the United States in 1991, in northern and eastern Idaho in 1993, In 1995 it was detected for the first time in western Washington and western Oregon and is currently considered to be well established there. The disease initially develops at a small loci within a field and spreads rapidly and has caused significant losses in areas where climatic conditions of are cool and wet.
Symptoms.
Infections produce linear, orange-yellow pustules appear on leaves and/or heads. As the disease progresses, pustules coalesce to form long stripes between leaf veins. On susceptible cultivars, entire leaf blades may be covered with pustules. The black spore stage develops as linear black pustules covered by the leaf epidermis. 
Disease cycle.
"Puccinia striiformis" f. sp. "hordei", is an obligate parasite that overseasons on volunteer barley or rye, certain wild barleys such as Hordeum jubatum (foxtail barley), wheat, and numerous perennial grass species.
The disease begins from a very small number of infections that are difficult or impossible to detect in the field. Spread of the pathogen can be explosive and cause significant losses, especially in the Pacific Northwest where cool, wet weather greatly favors disease development. 
Management.
The disease can be managed by growing disease resistant cultivars. Foliar fungicides may be required when growing a susceptible cultivars.

Philippe Aractingi

Philippe Aractingi (born 1964) is a Franco-Lebanese filmmaker.
Director.
Philippe Aractingi is a Franco-Lebanese director born in 1964. Self-taught, he begins his career by taking photographs of Beirut's daily life during the Lebanese civil war, and directs his first documentary at age 21. During an unstable period, he trusts his intuition, and launches into a profession that was almost absent in his country at the time.
In 1989, he leaves Lebanon, and moves to France. He opens himself up to the world, and until 2001, he directs around twenty films. As a multi-faceted director, he dedicates a film to the archeology in Sri Lanka, observes the daily lives of acrobat children in Morocco, and contemplates the giraffes in South Africa, always moving from one topic to another with the same passion of travel and discovery. In 1993, driven by the desire to experiment with various media and to touch on diverse topics, Philippe co-writes “Les Mères à l’Epreuve du Liban” with Lela Chikhani-Nacouz.
Meanwhile, he continues to devote part of his work to Lebanon, and to the aftermath of the war. Just as the latter ends, and as the borders are reopening between the Lebanese, he embarks on a journey to encounter the other by capturing the suffering of Lebanese women, the forgotten witnesses amidst the clashes. Through Mothers’ Eyes (1992) touches Lebanon in its entirety and beats audience records in France. In a poetic film, Beirut of Stones and Memories (1993), he reveals the scars of the city, associating texts by the Lebanese poet Nada Tueni with his images of Beirut ruins.
In 2001, Philippe Aractingi moves back to Lebanon and founds Fantascope Production; a content-driven company specialized in the production of all-format documentaries.
With Bosta (2005), his first feature-length fiction film, he offers an innovative look at Lebanon by directing a musical, a first for post-war Lebanon. With its 140 000 entries in Lebanon, a record number in 25 years, this road movie, both entertaining and realistic, reunites the Lebanese with their cinema, and paves the way for a new generation of films.
When in 2006 a new war breaks out in Lebanon, Philippe Aractingi, used to filming in a state of urgency, decides to shoot his second feature film. Filmed two days after the end of the war, Under the bombs (2008) places two professional actors in the heat of the moment, in the South of Lebanon, and confronts them with real actors (civilians, soldiers, rescue teams, etc.) who embody their actual roles. This fictional story with a real-life setting, which combines improvised and written scenes, has been distributed in around twenty countries. Under the Bombs has been selected at the Venice Film Festival, the Sundance Film Festival, and the Dubai International Film Festival. It has also won 23 prizes to date.
Bosta and Under the Bombs have both represented Lebanon at the Oscars.
For his third film, Philippe Aractingi bets on yet another type of writing: the autobiography. Heritages (2013) narrates the exile of his own family across four generations and a hundred years of history. As in the circus tradition, each member of the family, from the youngest to the oldest, embodies the role of an ancestor in addition to playing him or herself. The film effortlessly moves between archival images, reconstructed scenes and home videos, all the while dealing with often-difficult subjects of memory and transference with a smile.
In a country where cinematic studies did not exist, Philippe Aractingi pictured and shaped himself as a director. Today, Philippe Aractingi continues to be an active advocate for Lebanese cinema. He is a founding member of the Fondation Liban Cinema (FLC), and is the Vice President on the board of the Screen Institute Beirut.
Film after film, Philippe Aractingi is constantly searching for a new cinematographic form, which rests between fiction and reality, and is able to represent this region of the Middle East where chaos is always intertwined with order, and tragedy with joy.
Photographer.
Today, Philippe Aractingi devotes more time to his first love: photography. As a young man, he had taken pictures of Lebanon, fascinated by a war that later disgusted him. It is now only for pleasure that he takes pictures.
An exhibition took place in 2011 at the Galerie Modus in Paris. The exhibition was called "Nuit sur Beyrouth" (Night on Beirut") and described the evolution of this city where all shapes and colors are present.
His photos of Beyrouth are presented on France's most followed photography blog, "La Lettre de la Photography", by Philippe Garner, director of the Department of Photography at Christie's.
Other exhibitions are scheduled for 2013 and 2014.
Bosta.
Bosta (Bus in Arabic) tells the story of seven former schoolmates who meet up again after 15 years to drive across Lebanese regions in a rundown school bus, which the repaint and renew as a wound they are healling. The group is trying to introduce a new blend of music in their native village, a mic of the traditional dance - the Dabkeh - coupled to a techno beat; a mix that embodies this generation that grew up too fast. This group of friends tries to bring a modern twist to the past in a world that has lost all bearings. The bus thus takes its passengers across Lebanon, on an emotionally bumpy journey of self-discovery and re-acquaintance with the multiple identities of their country.
Under the Bombs.
Zeina is living in Dubai. In the middle of a divorce, she sends her son Karim to stay with her sister in Kherbet Selem, a little village in the South of Lebanon, to spare him his parents’ fights.
A few days later, the war breaks out.
Desperately worried, Zeina also leaves for the Lebanon, via Turkey.
But because of the blockade she reaches the port of Beirut only on the day of the ceasefire. In exchange for a large sum of money, Tony, a taxi-driver, agrees to take her to the South.
Tony is a Christian, he lives in Beirut and his brother lives in Israel, and Zeina is a Shia, so they have little in common. What difference does it make?.
Together, they search the centres for displaced people as they cross through a ravaged landscape.
When they get to Kherbet Selem, the town is in ruins.
Zeina’s sister has been killed and Ali, a youngster from the village, tells them that Karim has been taken away by French journalists.
Zeina and Tony go in search of the lost child…
To this day, Under the bombs has won 23 prizes among which

Open conference

The term Open conference (or "openconference") is a derivative of the adjective "opensource", and its meaning is similarly based on the ideas of public access and community development found in the open source culture and OpenCourseWare movements. "Conference" in this sense is used to indicate an academic or professional gathering of practitioners in a given field to present and discuss current thought, research, and practice.
An open conference is a conference that is open to the general public (usually at no cost) and encourages or requires participants to relax or eliminate intellectual property restrictions on ideas generated and presentations delivered during the conference. Presenters often make presentations and materials available to the public for free access and use, for example through the use of a Creative Commons non-commercial attribution license.
Open conference organizers seek to open access to the conference for attendees by elimination of cost (relying on community support and sponsorships), they also provide community access to archived presentations and discussions through similar licensing agreements.
Additionally, attendees are encouraged to become participants in a collaborative community that supports and grows the conference—even to derive new open conferences.

Godiva device

The Lady Godiva device was an unshielded, pulsed nuclear reactor originally situated at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), New Mexico, U.S. It was one of a number of criticality devices within Technical Area 18 (TA-18). Specifically, it was used to produce bursts of neutrons and gamma rays for irradiating test samples, and inspired development of Godiva-like reactors. Physicist Otto Frisch remembered the Los Alamos team called an earlier unshielded uranium-235 assembly in 1944 "Lady Godiva".
The radiation source within the Godiva device was a fissile metallic mass (usually highly enriched 235U), about 30 cm in diameter. This was located at the top of a two-metre-high metal tower. The burst of radiation was produced when a piston of fissile material was quickly inserted and extracted from a cavity within the larger fissile mass. During the time these two masses were combined, they formed a critical mass and a nuclear chain reaction was briefly sustained.
Godiva's design was inspired from a self terminating property discovered when incorrectly experimenting with the Jemima device in 1952. Jemima operated by remotely lifting one stack of enriched uranium-235 disks up towards another, fixed, stack. On 18 April 1952, due to a miscalculation, Jemima was assembled with too many disks; this caused an excursion of 1.5 x 1016 fissions—an automatic scram—but no damage.
On 3 February 1954 and 12 February 1957, accidental criticality excursions occurred causing damage to the device, but fortunately only insignificant exposures to personnel. This original Godiva device, known as "Lady Godiva", was irreparable after the second accident and was replaced by the "Godiva II".
Godiva II.
Godiva II was constructed inside a concrete building with walls and roof in a canyon a quarter-mile away from the control room.
In 1959, Los Alamos agreed to make Godiva II available to DOD contractors free of charge for 2 days each month, acknowledging its unique facility for radiation tests.
Godiva's success in creating intense bursts spurred development of similar pulsed reactors, which also suffered accidental excursions, for example: 28 May 1965 at the 1965 White Sands Missile Range (parts were thrown 15 feet); and 6 September 1968 at the Aberdeen Proving Ground (middle melted, disks warped and bolts stretched).
In December 2002, the U.S. Department of Energy announced it was to move its TA-18 testing equipment including the Godiva burst machine from the LANL to the Device Assembly Facility (DAF) at the Nevada Test Site (NTS).

Jules Maxwell

Jules Maxwell (born October 28, 1965 in Bangor, Northern Ireland) is a songwriter, and composer who is best known as composer for the 1998 Oscar nominated short Dance Lexie Dance. His composition work for dance theatre draws upon minimalism and is often recorded, incorporating strong melodic montages of sampled sound influenced by the work of Gavin Bryars. He lives in London.
Biography.
Jules Maxwell’s career in music began in rather unlikely circumstances.
As a politics undergraduate at Queen’s University in Belfast he hooked up with the drama society and began composing music for their productions. Up to that point he had no intention of working professionally as a musician. Subsequently however, this unlikely group of actors, writers, directors and musicians went on to form Tinderbox Theatre Company.
The early years.
From 1988 through to 2002 Maxwell composed for fifteen of the first Tinderbox shows. These included Lynne Parker’s production of Catchpenny Twist by Stewart Parker, Gary Mitchell’s “Independent Voice”, Marie Jones “Ruby” and Tim Loane’s “Caught Red Handed”.
One thing led to another and during this period he also began picking up work as a composer for contemporary dance, working for 4 seasons with Limerick based Daghdha Dance Company.
He moved from Belfast to Dublin in 1994 and forged an exciting relationship with fledgling animation house Moving Still with whom he collaborated on 2 series for television: “Ri Ra” was an Irish language programme for RTÉ/UTV, and “Stop, Look, Listen, Animals” was a 6 part series for Channel 4.
1997 marked a significant turning point in his career. He made the soundtrack for Oscar nominated short film "Dance Lexie Dance” directed by Tim Loane, an old college friend from Queen’s, and also collaborated with Wayne McGregor for the first time on an audacious dance project called “Cybergeneration” for Belfast Festival.
Ultimately these successes led to more and more opportunities in London and he moved there in 1997.
The London Years.
Since 1997 he has composed music for countless theatre, dance and film productions. He has worked with Israeli choreographer Jasmin Vardimon on her productions of “Lure, Lure, Lure” and “Ticklish”. He has continued to collaborate with Wayne McGregor – “Digit01” and “Alpha”, and Cathy Marston – “Sophie” and “Before the Tempest”, and recently spent a year in Antwerp working with Retina Dance Company.
He has become a regular collaborator for Box Clever Theatre Company and recently composed for the Young Vic’s acclaimed production of Some Voices by Joe Penhall.
Film remains an area of intense interest and over the last 6 years Maxwell has composed soundtracks for Terry Loane (“Cluck”), Colin Bateman (“The Devil You Know”), Suzanne Arnold (“The Goblin Market”), Lucy Baldwyn (“Freeze”) and Magali Charrier (“Tralala”).
He has also forged a long standing working relationship with Devon based choreographer and film maker Jane Mason, and has created soundtracks for all her theatre and screen projects to date.
Yet through it all Jules Maxwell’s roots are as a piano player and he continues to play and write with various bands and artists. In Belfast he collaborated for a number of years with Brian Houston and co-produced his debut solo album “Crush”. He also played piano with Peacefrog, Iain Archer, Disreali Gears and with these artists over the years opened for the likes of INXS, Van Morrison, David Bowie, Elvis Costello, The Cranberries, Squeeze, Hal Ketchum, Jools Holland and Nick Lowe. He has written and recorded extensively with Ken Haddock, co-producing his “Sweetest Hour” album and is currently working with another Belfast protégé Foy Vance.
Recorded Work.
He has released three albums of his own to date. “Bolt” is an eclectic collection of songs and instrumentals. “Hard Shoulder” is the 1998 piece devised for Retina Dance Company for his quartet The Jules Maxwell Project. “Candy Floss” is an exploration of childhood through soundscape and lullaby.
In 1998 he began a ten year project entitled “Nil Pointe” which will eventually culminate in the release of an album of songs which have failed to get past the preliminary stages of the Eurovision Song Contest. He has successfully received rejection for six entries to date: Little Tiny Raindrops (1999), Your Future’s Just Begun (2000), Every Little Thing I Never Bargained For (2001), True to You (2002), Oo Be Do Believe (2003), My Baby (2004).
Jules Maxwell was awarded the James Kilfedder Arts Award in 1997 and the Bass Ireland Award in 2003 for his pioneering Red Room Sessions.
He currently lives in London.

New folk media

New Folk Media is a developing movement in experimental film and video art which is concerned with the use of existing media for artistic expression without regard for copyright or ownership. The movement traces its roots in Joseph Cornell and his film Rose Hobart and other found footage films. It can also be traced to Sergei Eisenstein's aborted film project Que Viva Mexico which has been edited by countless filmmakers and artists including Kenneth Anger. Other early examples that have influenced the development of New Folk Media can be found in the works of Bruce Conner, Jonas Mekas, Ken Jacobs, Craig Baldwin and Kenneth Anger.
New Folk Media is a reaction to the growing ownership of every form of media. Practitioners of New Folk Media consider existing media to be the same as paint or words that can be used by the artist to create a new work.
New Folk Media is also often concerned with issues such as postcolonialism and ownership of culture. Often the works involve world cultural events that are broadcast on television, but according to practitioners of New Folk Media are not truly owned by anyone because they are part of world culture. Through there works this group of artists seek to represent these televised cultural events in a personal way, creating a new meaning for the media as it relates to their own experience of the event.
YouTube can be seen as part of the New Folk Media movement, as many videos are mash-ups of pre-existing content given new meaning. Snakes on a Plane is also considered by some to have some relationship to New Folk Media, although there is no consensus regarding its inclusion in the movement.
The earliest definitive examples of the movement include "Inauguration" (2004), "Brooklyn Waterfront/North Sixth" (2004) and "Televised Pope Funeral" (2004).
Other influences on the movement include the sampling in music such as the KLF and Negativeland.
New Folk Media is also seen as a descendant of Pop Art and Post-Modernism, but it is generally considered a 21st Century art movement.

Lamb (film)

Lamb is a 1985 British drama film, directed by Colin Gregg and starring Liam Neeson, Hugh O'Conor and Ian Bannen. The film is based on the novel by Bernard MacLaverty, who also wrote the screenplay.
Plot.
"Lamb" tells the story of a young priest, Brother Sebastian, who works in a Roman Catholic institution for troubled boys on the Atlantic coast of Ireland, referred to as "a finishing school for the sons of the Idle Poor" by its head, Brother Benedict. There, the Brothers teach boys to conform in a harsh, uncompromising regime which Brother Sebastian, whose real name is Michael Lamb, finds deeply distasteful. The Brothers teach the boys "a little of God and a lot of fear."
When his father dies, leaving him a small legacy, the tie which kept him at the home is gone and he decides to leave and take Owen Kane, a bullied, unhappy 10-year-old boy with him. His decision is also affected by the fact that he has made a vow of poverty and Brother Benedict expects him to hand his inheritance over to the Brothers.
Michael has formed an attachment to Owen. He is the youngest boy there and has been in the home for two years. Brother Benedict beats him for painting graffiti on the wall outside, because it ends with the word OK – Owen's initials – despite knowing that it was not Owen who did it. Owen comes from a broken family and a drunken, abusive father. Michael cannot see how he will survive there and wishes to give him his freedom.
He secretly leaves the school and takes Owen with him to London hoping to be the boy's saviour, although he knows he is committing a criminal act. They pass themselves off as father and son and move from hotel to hotel. Michael lets Owen smoke, play on gaming machines and takes him to a football match to see his favourite team Arsenal play, but Owen, an epileptic, has a fit. They have to slip away from the medical centre before questions are asked. 
Owen sometimes prattles on and on and sometimes just sits silently. Michael feels embarrassed during the silences and recognises that Owen controls the communication between them. As the days and weeks go by, Michael became more comfortable with the silences and they laugh a lot.
As his money dwindles and news of the kidnapping reaches the Irish community, with Owen's picture in the newspaper, Michael finds himself running out of ideas on how to save the boy's life. About to fly back to Ireland, they come across an ex-army man called Haddock who tells them about a nearby squat and says they can move in. Michael returns to the hotel to find Owen in floods of tears, thinking Michael has left him. In an emotional scene, Michael tells Owen he loves him and man and boy hug and hold each other tight.
Michael gets a job, leaving Owen at the squat, but returns to find that Haddock, who he knows is gay, is in his dressing gown, has his arm around the boy's shoulders and has been letting Owen smoke pot. Michael is worried Haddock may have molested the boy, or will try to, and decides they have to leave.
The "denouement" of the novel is grim. Determined to save Owen from being forced to return to the home, but realising he cannot look after the boy himself, Michael drowns him in the sea during Owen's next seizure, after hearing him describe the experience of a seizure as a form of joy. Having murdered the boy, Michael tries to drown himself, but is unable to.
Trivia.
For the exterior of the borstal, The Camelot Castle Hotel in Tintagel Cornwall was used. Many of the child extras were from Bodmin Comprehensive School and from Bishop Douglass school in East Finchley North London.

Henry Pleasants (music critic)

Henry Pleasants (May 12, 1910 – January 4, 2000) was an American music critic and intelligence officer.
Early career.
Pleasants studied voice, piano and composition at the Curtis Institute of Music, from which he received an honorary doctorate in 1977. In 1930, at age 19, he became a music critic for the "Philadelphia Evening Bulletin" and was the paper's music editor from 1934 to 1942, when he enlisted in the U.S. Army.
In 1948-49, he re-entered the military as an army liaison officer with the Austrian government. He left the army to enter the Foreign Service in 1950, serving as an intelligence officer in Munich. From 1950 to 1956, he was the CIA station chief in Bern, and subsequently from 1956 until his retirement from the CIA in 1964, CIA station chief in Bonn. He was involved in espionage during the Cold War, living with Reinhard Gehlen, a former Nazi general and a top intelligence official for West Germany, to evaluate his "suitability." The Gehlen Organization, which the former general led, became the forerunner of the postwar West German Federal Intelligence Service.
Writing.
Following the end of the war, from 1945 to 1955, Pleasants contributed articles on European musical events to "The New York Times". He also wrote regularly for "Opera Quarterly", was London editor for the magazine "Stereo Review", and for 30 years, beginning in 1967, was the London music critic for the "International Herald Tribune". In 1964, he retired from the service and settled in London with his wife, Virginia Pleasants, a harpsichordist and fortepianist.
His most famous and controversial work was his 1955 publication "The Agony of Modern Music", a polemical attack on the direction taken by much of twentieth-century music and an argument in favor of jazz as the "true" master music of the time. The book stated, "Serious music is a dead art. The vein which for 300 years offered a seemingly inexhaustible yield of beautiful music has run out. What we know as modern music is the noise made by deluded speculators picking through its slag pile." He further developed this critique of contemporary music in "Death of a Music?: The Decline of the European Tradition and the Rise of Jazz" (1961) and "Serious Music and All That Jazz" (1969).
Henry Pleasants’s first and major enthusiasm, however, was the human voice. His "The Great Singers: From the Dawn of Opera to Our Own Time" (1966) became a standard reference work. Other books on singers and singing were "The Great American Popular Singers", "Opera in Crisis: Tradition, Present, Future"," "and "The Great Tenor Tragedy: The Last Days of Adolphe Nourrit", about the nineteenth-century French singer who committed suicide after his vocal style became outdated. His article "Elvis Presley," reprinted in Simon Firth, ed., "Popular Music: Ciritical Concepts in Media and Cultural Studies", volume 3 (2004), describes in detail Elvis Presley's "extraordinary compass and very wide range of vocal color."
Death.
On January 4, 2000, Pleasants died aged 89 in a London hospital after suffering a ruptured aorta. He was survived by his wife, harpsichordist "Virginia Pleasants" (1911 - 2011), two sisters, Constantia Bowditch of Peterborough, New Hampshire, and Nancy Logue of Clarksville, Tennessee; and a brother, William, of Bethel, Delaware (1911 - 2005).

Maxxie Oliver

Maxxie Oliver is a fictional character in the British television series "Skins." He is portrayed by actor Mitch Hewer.
Characterisation.
Maxxie is portrayed as proficient at several styles of dance, including tap dance. He is also shown as being a brilliant artist, seductive, well-liked and well-adjusted. He is hinted to having many promiscuous relationships throughout the series. He is somewhat of a comedian, particularly with best friends Anwar Kharral and Chris Miles. According to a Myspace-style "about me" section on the "Skins" website, he describes his favorite things as toast, boys, dancing, drawing, Arcade Fire and the Sistine Chapel, and he wants to meet Johnny Depp, Nigel Reo-Coker and Ron from "Harry Potter".
Like Anwar, Maxxie does not have an episode name to himself, instead being the centric character in "Maxxie & Anwar" and "Tony & Maxxie", although the episode "Sketch" greatly involves him, as it is about his stalker.
Character history.
Series 1.
In "Tony", he convinces Anwar and Chris to join him on a "big gay night out", but eventually goes to Abigail Stock's party after the night out wasn't what was expected. 
In "Maxxie and Anwar", on a school trip to Russia, Maxxie and his best mate Anwar face issues regarding their status as best friends, with Anwar's faith condemning homosexuality. Maxxie indicates he views Anwar as homophobic and hypocritical - as a Muslim, Anwar dislikes gay people but at the same time has pre-marital sex, takes drugs and drinks alcohol. Eventually, Maxxie tries one more time to get Anwar to accept him, but Anwar reluctantly refuses, ending their friendship. Maxxie walks away with tears in his eyes. Tony Stonem tries repeatedly to seduce Maxie to 'try something new' which Maxxie refuses because of Tony's girlfriend Michelle Richardson After his fight with Anwar, he gets very drunk and in his distraught state gives into temptation with Tony for means of comfort - and informs Tony that he wasn't good. Unknown to them, Michelle has witnessed the entire thing. 
In "Michelle", Tony is seen continuing to flirt with Maxxie, and Michelle subsequently dumps Tony. Maxxie is quick to apologise to Michelle for the incident in Russia, and he is upset when she derides him as a "dirty little slut who fucks around with other people's boyfriends". Later, racked with guilt over his friends' breakup, Maxxie states in his psychology lesson that it was his fault that Tony ended up giving him head, to quote 'I lost my head and then he gave me head', despite the fact that everything that happened had been pushed for and orchestrated by Tony.
In the series 1 finale, Maxxie calls Anwar to wish him a happy birthday, however, he refuses to attend his party until Anwar tells his parents that Maxxie is gay. Anwar, desperate to see Maxxie, eventually finds him waiting outside, still refusing to go inside. Mr. Kharral eventually arrives outside, spotting Maxxie and the two talk until Anwar tells his father that Maxxie is gay. Mr. Kharral seemingly ignores Anwar until Maxxie restates it himself. Mr. Kharral then explains that there are a lot of things in the world he doesn't understand - particularly homosexuality - but that his faith in Allah means he believes God one day will reveal to him all he does not understand and until then, will treat Maxxie no differently. With that, Maxxie and Anwar's friendship is renewed. Maxxie and Anwar also back up Chris in the brawl later that night and in the end Maxxie happily ends up in an embrace with one of Chris' attackers who has seemingly fallen for him.
Series 2.
The series two premiere episode, which is focused on Tony, introduces Maxxie's parents: Jackie (Fiona Allen) and Walter Oliver (Bill Bailey), revealing Maxxie's surname, that he has a dog called Taz and the situation with his parents. After Tony's accident in series one and his subsequent brain trauma, Maxxie, Jal Fazer and Michelle are the only friends who are still there for him. His mother, who used to work as Tony's nanny, is taking on that role again. Like Maxxie, his father and even his dog dance in their spare time, although Maxxie struggles to convince his dad to let him drop his A Levels and audition for musicals in London. Though Maxxie generally comes from a stable home with loving parents, he remains subject to homophobic abuse from "chavs" on the council estate where he lives. It later turns out that one of the chavs – Dale – is in fact gay after tackling Maxxie to the ground and kissing him at a later opportunity. Maxxie resists at first but eventually gives in and they end up sleeping together. When Maxxie returns home the next morning, he sees a distraught Tony and comforts him. Eventually in the episode, after Walter has had much time to reflect on his relationship with his son, they agree that he will at least continue his A Levels, even if he does not join his father as a builder afterwards as Walter would prefer.
In "Sketch", Maxxie is stalked by Sketch, a young Welsh student who cares for her ailing mother in the flat opposite Maxxie's. Sketch takes pictures of Maxxie and pins them up on a board of her room, leaves Maxxie several gifts in his locker, leaving him to wonder who they're from, makes herself appear more masculine (such as wearing male clothing and flattening her chest with a sash) to appear attractive to him, and watches him practice a performance with Michelle in a musical.
Following this, in the "Unseen Skins" episode "A Cycological Romance", Monday: Maxxie meets a new love interest: James (played by Sean Verey), who is also gay and a cyclist. Maxxie seems very interested, leaving him a note on his bicycle. Sketch steals this note, later slashing Maxxie's tires. Tuesday: Maxxie is forced to take the bus, and so leaving a window for Sketch to approach James warning him off on the grounds that she was his ex-girlfriend and he stalks her (both lies). Wednesday: James tells Maxxie to leave him alone, only to work out Sketch was lying. The next morning (Thursday), James finds his tires slashed and is also forced to get the bus, meeting Maxxie on board. They talk and work out that this is all Sketch's work; they decide to start again. Sketch is seen outside looking in with a face of melancholy, as the two exchange names. In the television episode "Jal", Maxxie proudly introduces James to everyone at college. Sketch seems to look jealous at the pairing whilst Anwar looks uneasy.
In his last episode, Maxxie and James move to London together, also being joined by Anwar, who abandons Sketch at the bus stop.
U.S. adaption.
Maxxie was the only character from the original UK version who didn't appear in the American adaptation. He was replaced by Tea Marvelli, a self-proclaimed lesbian.

Portea is a genus of the botanical family Bromeliaceae, subfamily Bromelioideae, and is native to the Atlantic coast of Brazil.
It is named for Dr. Marius Porte, a 19th-century French naturalist who died in 1866 in Manilla while on a collection expedition for the National Museum of Natural History.
Characteristics.
"Portea" is a small group of plants. According to the Bromeliad Binomial it currently includes just nine species. The plants are natives of the eastern coast of Brazil where they tend to be medium to large plants. They thrive in strong light. The foliage of this genus is often quite attractive although heavily protected by sharp spines. The branches of the inflorescence are somewhat lengthy. This characteristic makes the bloom even more stunning. The plant produces a tall bloom of lavender flowers followed by dark purple berries. Although the leaves are frost sensitive, the plants themselves usually survive cold temperatures and produce blooms in the late spring.

Georg Kulenkampff

Georg Kulenkampff (23 January 1898 - 4 October 1948) was a concert violinist, one of the best-known German virtuosi of the 1930s and 1940s. Considered one of the finest violinists of the 20th century, Kulenkampff was known for his interpretations of works from the Romantic period. Kulenkampff gave the premiere performance of Robert Schumann's violin concerto and made the first recording of the piece; additionally, his performances of the violin concertos of Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Glazunov, and Bruch are considered among the finest on record. Only the fact that his recording career coincided with the Nazi era, coupled with his early death from encephalitis, has prevented his name from being better known to modern listeners.
Georg Kulenkampff was the son of a well-to-do merchant family in Bremen. He took an interest in the violin from a very young age, and from 1904 (aged 6) began to receive instruction from the concertmaster of the Bremen Philharmonic Orchestra, and afterwards with its conductor Ernst Wendel. He then received lessons and encouragement from Leopold Auer (teacher of Mischa Elman, Efrem Zimbalist, Nathan Milstein and others) in Dresden, and made a concert debut in 1912 as solo violinist. On Auer's recommendation he was sent to study with Willy Heß at the Berlin Music Hochschule and became in time director of the Hochschule Orchestra.
Kulenkampff suffered health problems in his early life, and towards the end of the First World War he returned to his home town to become concert-master of the Bremen Philharmonic Orchestra. However he made rapid progress, especially as a soloist, and in 1923 he became a professor-in-ordinary at the Berlin Music Hochschule. He taught there until 1926, when his solo career became all-absorbing, but resumed teaching there in 1931 until his departure from Germany in 1944. At the same time he gave concerts throughout Germany and, increasingly, in various parts of Europe, and had a busy broadcasting career. In 1927, he performed the Bach Double Violin Concerto in D minor with Alma Moodie (a student of Carl Flesch) and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra (BPO)
In 1935 he formed a celebrated trio with the pianist Edwin Fischer and the cellist Enrico Mainardi, in which he remained active until 1948. At his death he was replaced as violinist by Wolfgang Schneiderhan. He also played in piano duos, especially with Georg Solti and Wilhelm Kempff: with Solti he recorded the Brahms sonatas, Mozart's 20th sonata and Beethoven's "Kreutzer" sonata for Decca, and there is also a "Kreutzer" with Kempff (DGG, 1935). His (Decca) recording of the Brahms Double Concerto with Mainardi, under the baton of Carl Schuricht, is distinguished.
In 1937 he gave the premiere of the rediscovered Violin Concerto in D minor of Robert Schumann, which had been studied and suppressed by Joseph Joachim, but which Kulenkampff now revived with the help of Georg Schünemann, the Nazi-appointed Director of the "Prussian State Library" (German: Preußische Staatsbibliothek), where the autograph score was housed, and Paul Hindemith, whose compositions were already banned by the Nazi authorities. The addition of this work to the repertoire was a very important and successful affair, and soon afterwards Kulenkampff made the world premiere recording. Before the war he recorded the Beethoven (BPO under Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt) and Mendelssohn concerti: he maintained the Mendelssohn in performance despite the ban on his music, and used the cadenzas of Fritz Kreisler.
Kulenkampff gave various other world premieres, notable of works by Ottorino Respighi (Violin Sonata No. 2) and by Jean Sibelius. He was very much in demand and very busy during the Nazi period, as an "Aryan" musician, though he did not subscribe to the racial theory and, by virtue of his importance as a German performer, was able to maintain proscribed parts of the repertoire.
In 1940 he moved to Potsdam, and in 1944, with increasingly unsatisfactory demands from the prevailing powers, he left Germany for Switzerland. From 1943 there is a live recording from Berlin of a performance of the Sibelius concerto conducted by Wilhelm Furtwängler with the BPO. From Switzerland he continued to develop his international solo career, and he became successor to Carl Flesch at the Conservatory in Lucerne. He was first violin in the Kulenkampff Quartet from 1944. Among his students was Ruggiero Ricci.
Kulenkampff died in Schaffhausen, Switzerland of encephalitis (spinal paralysis) at the age of only 50, suffering a rapid onset soon after his last concert. His writings appeared posthumously in 1952 under the title, 'A Violinist's Observations' ("Geigerische Betrachtungen").

Biography.
He was disinherited by his father, J. Howard Marshall II, after siding with William Koch in Koch's attempt to take over Koch Industries, Inc. from his brother, Charles Koch; Marshall II, who was a board member of the company, and his other son, E. Pierce Marshall, supported Charles. After learning he no longer had a swing vote position, Marshall III agreed to sell his interests for $8 million. He also claimed that J. Howard promised him that he would "not" disinherit him, and that Marshall III's mother would receive a $100,000 per year allowance. After J. Howard's death, Marshall III filed suit against Pierce, claiming that he had decided to deprive his brother of his righful inheritance.
In March 2001, a Texas probate jury found that J. Howard's will and trust were valid, and had not been executed under fraud or malice; Pierce had not committed any wrongdoing; and that Howard III and J. Howard's widow Anna Nicole Smith, were not entitled to any of his $1.6 billion fortune. Further, the jury found Marshall III had committed fraud with actual malice against J. Howard's estate and awarded Pierce $35 million.

Independent regulatory agencies in Turkey

Independent regulatory agencies in Turkey are public authorities within the executive branch of the state that are autonomous from the government or any other bodies. They constitute service-based (as opposed to geographical) decentralized administration in terms of the Turkish constitution.
Independent regulatory agencies represent a historically unfamiliar mode of governance in Turkey whose tradition of public administration favors a strong and centralized state with a preference of market intervention. The waves of liberalization and privatization measures taken following the 1980 coup d'etat, the conditionalities imposed by the European Union and the economic crises during the 1990s and early 2000s provided the necessary momentum for their establishment.
Despite a certain degree of controversy in the Turkish legal doctrine most scholars have accepted that the concept has been well-established within Turkish legal and administrative system even though there is no legal framework governing these bodies nor a sufficient body of case-law by the supreme judicial courts that clarify their administrative nature.
Independent regulatory agencies in Turkey include: 
The Sugar Authority and the Restructuring Board can also be conceived as independent regulatory agencies.

Suicide of Ryan Halligan

Ryan Patrick Halligan (December 18, 1989 – October 7, 2003) was an American student from Essex Junction, Vermont, who committed suicide at the age of 13 after being bullied from his classmates in real life and cyber-bullying online. According to the Associated Press, Halligan was repeatedly sent homophobic instant messages, and was "threatened, taunted and insulted incessantly".
His father, John P. Halligan, a former IBM engineer, subsequently lobbied for laws to be passed in Vermont to improve how schools address bullying and suicide prevention. He has also given speeches at schools in other states about the story of his son.
Halligan's case has been cited by legislators in various states proposing legislation to curb cyber-bullying. In Vermont, laws were subsequently enacted to address the cyberbullying problem and the risk of teen suicides, in response. In 2008, his suicide and its causes were examined in a segment of the PBS "Frontline" television program entitled "Growing Up Online." His suicide has also been referenced in many other news stories on bullying.
Biography.
Early life.
Halligan was born on December 18, 1989 in Poughkeepsie, New York, the son of John P. and Kelly Halligan. His family moved to Essex Junction, Vermont, where Halligan attended Hiawatha Elementary School and, later, Albert D. Lawton Middle School. 
He was described by his father as a "gentle, very sensitive soul," who experienced some developmental delays affecting speech and physical coordination in his early school years. Although he overcame those difficulties by the fourth grade, "He still struggled; school was never easy to him, but he always showed up with a smile on his face, eager to do his best," said his father.
Bullying.
From January to October 2000, Halligan suffered bullying at the hands of a group of students at his school because of his learning disorder and because his passion for music (drums and guitar) and his love for drama set him apart. His father said that when Ryan told him he was being picked on, his initial response was to ignore the boys, as they were just bullying him with words. The family said later in a short documentary that Halligan enrolled in counseling, with little success. After that he moved up to middle school, where the bullying continued on and off for the next 2 years. 
In December 2002, Ryan told his father that the bullying had started again. He asked for a Taebo Kick Boxing set for Christmas in order to learn how to defend himself. At first his father wanted to go to the school principal and sort things out, but Ryan wanted to learn how to fight, believing that complaining to the school about the boys would make things worse. After Christmas, Ryan and his father developed a routine of practicing downstairs in the basement for 2 hours every night. After Ryan had learned to handle himself, his father told him not to pick fights at school, but said that if any student ever touched him aggressively, Ryan had his father's permission to defend himself as best as he could. 
In February 2003 Halligan had a fight with the bully, which was broken up by the assistant principal; after that, the bully stopped bothering the boy. Toward the end of 7th grade, Halligan told his father that he and the bully had become friends. But, after Halligan told the boy about an embarrassing examination required after he had stomach pains, he learned that the bully misused the story to spread a rumor that Halligan was gay.
According to his father and news reports, during the summer of 2003, Halligan spent much of his time online, particularly on AIM and other instant messaging services. Halligan did not tell his parents about this. During the summer, he was cyber-bullied by schoolmates who taunted him, thinking he was gay. Ryan was also bullied at school about this; his father later learned that on one occasion, Ryan ran out of the classroom in tears. As Ryan had unintentionally archived these online conversations on his hard drive when he installed DeadAIM, his father was able to read these discussions. Ryan had deliberately saved transcripts of online exchanges in which Ashley, a popular girl whom Halligan had a crush on, pretended to like him. Later at school, she told him that he was a "loser". According to the ABC Primetime report, she had once been his friend and defended him when the bullying first started; when she became more popular in middle school, she left him behind. He found out she only pretended to like him only to gain personal information about him. She copied and pasted their private exchanges into other IMs among his schoolmates to embarrass and humiliate him. Mr. Halligan said that he was proud of his son sticking up for himself.
After the girl had called him a loser, Ryan said, "It's girls like you who make me want to kill myself." His father found out about this later because it was a matter of record with the local police. Halligan's father also discovered some disturbing conversations between Ryan and a boy with a screen name he did not recognize. Halligan began communicating online with a pen-pal about suicide and death, and told him he was thinking about suicide. They had been exchanging information they had found on sites relating to death and suicide, including sites that taught them how to painlessly kill themselves. The pen-pal answered "Phew. It's about fucking time," shortly after Ryan told him he was thinking about suicide, two weeks before he killed himself. This was the last conversation he had with the pen-pal. As Halligan found out, contrary to popular belief, Ryan's pen-pal was a boy Ryan knew up until third grade when the boy and his parents moved away. When they found each other online, they reconnected. 
The pen-pal had, according to Halligan's father, turned into a very negative person with a bleak outlook on life. Online the boys discussed how much they hated their popular classmates and how they made them feel. The penpal suggested suicide as a way out, writing, "If you killed yourself you would really make them feel bad." Ryan's father said that the boy was the worst possible friend that Ryan could have had at that time. 
The parents acknowledged that Ryan had discussed some of his worries and brought up suicide. He had told them his report card would be bad, and worried that his parents would be disappointed in him. One night he asked his dad if he had ever thought of suicide, who responded that he had, but also said, "Ryan, imagine if I did do that. Look at all the things we would have missed out on as a family."
Suicide and aftermath.
On October 7, 2003, John Halligan was away on business. Early in the morning, when family members were still sleeping, Ryan Halligan committed suicide by hanging himself. His body was found later by his older sister.
Although Halligan left no suicide note, his father learned of the cyberbullying when he accessed his son's computer. He had checked his son's yearbook first and found the faces of the bullying group scribbled out. Halligan had scribbled over the face of the ringleader (the same boy who fought Halligan, befriended him, and then started the gay rumor) so aggressively he had torn the paper. John Halligan accessed his son's computer and first learned of the cyber-bullying when his son's friends told him. 
When he learned that Ashley was being blamed for Halligan's suicide, the father had her brought over to his house. He reportedly said to her, "You did a bad thing, but you're not a bad person." She appeared with John Halligan on ABC Primetime to speak out against bullying. Although the Halligans moved out of Vermont, she still maintains contact with them. 
He confronted the bully who had started the gay rumor after he found out he had made fun of how Halligan killed himself. At first he was so angry he wanted to go to the boy's house and "crush that little jerk," but he had time to think while stuck in traffic. Halligan reportedly said to the boy, "You have no idea the amount of pain you caused my son. And you're still bullying him now even when he's defenseless and you are still lying to your parents about it. I refuse to believe that you are so cruel and that you don't have a heart." Shortly afterward the bully broke down into tears and repeatedly apologized for what he did.
John Halligan wanted to file charges against the bully but the police said there was not a criminal law that covered the circumstances. Halligan forgave the boy as well as Ashley. After learning the name of the penpal, Halligan's father went to his house and talked with his parents. Halligan said that he did not want the penpal to use the conversations for "something dark." While at the bully's house, John Halligan learned that the boy's father never received any hard copies of the conversations. The penpal's mother came and pulled out the hard copies from under the sofa, showing them to the father for "what appeared to be the first time." While the father was looking at the copies, the mother threw John Halligan out. Halligan said that he never got a satisfying response from the boy or his family. He still visits the boy's website, which contains several references to death and suicide. 
The senior Halligan began to lobby for legislation in Vermont to improve how schools address bullying and suicide prevention. He has also given speeches to schools in various states about the story of his son and the devastating effects of cyber-bullying among teens. 
Vermont enacted a Bullying Prevention Policy Law in May 2004 and later adopted a Suicide Prevention Law (Act 114) in 2005, closely following a draft submitted by Halligan's father. The law provides measures to assist teachers and others to recognize and respond to depression and suicide risks among teens. Halligan's case has also been cited by legislators in other states proposing legislation to curb cyber-bullying.
Halligan's story was featured on a "Frontline" television program entitled "Growing Up Online," produced in January, 2008, by WGBH-TV in Boston and distributed nationwide over PBS. In it, his father recounts his shock upon discovering the extent of the abuse his son endured, saying he believes that bullying on the internet "amplified and accelerated the hurt and pain he was trying to deal with, that started in the real world." Halligan's story has also been featured on Oprah in a report they did on a rise in homophobic teasing in schools. In addition, he presented his powerful assembly to many schools across the country.

Nesoryzomys indefessus, also known as the Santa Cruz Nesoryzomys or Indefatigable Galápagos Mouse, is a rodent of the genus "Nesoryzomys" of family Cricetidae from Galápagos Islands of Ecuador. It contains two subspecies: one ("N. i. indefessus") formerly lived on Santa Cruz Island, but is now extinct, probably due to the introduction of black rats; and another ("N. i. narboroughi") that is still alive on Fernandina Island. The two are sometimes considered to be different species.
Its specific name is Latin for "unwearied, indefatigable", but the species was named after its island, which was formerly known as "Indefatigable Island" after a ship with the same name.

His father, a graduate of the Morgan State College, moved the family to Baltimore, in 1952, to take a job as the Dean of men at Morgan State and assistant rector at the St. James Episcopal Church. Anderson's parents divorced in 1957 and he and his two sisters were raised by his mother.
Education.
Anderson attended primary schools in Baltimore and Glencoe, Illinois. In 1964 he entered the Baltimore City College. He was the captain of the football and track teams and won a scholarship to Rutgers University. Anderson majored in political science and made the freshman and varsity football and freshman track teams. In the fall of 1969, Rutgers played Princeton, in the 100th Anniversary of college football; the first game being played by Rutgers and Princeton in 1869. Anderson saw limited action in the game and left Rutgers at the end of the semester. In 1973 he entered Morgan State College where he earned his bachelor’s degree in political science. He also played on the legendary “Ten Bears” lacrosse team, the only black college lacrosse team in America. In 1982, after, his television career, he entered the University of Baltimore Law School where he earned his Juris Doctor.
Television career.
Prior to running for the House of Delegates, Anderson anchored the news at channel 2, WMAR-TV, and channel 11, WBAL-TV, in Baltimore, Maryland. Anderson was first hired by WBAL in 1976 as a reporter where he regularly covered the state legislature, Baltimore City Hall, produced features and even boxed a round with Muhammad Ali as a feature story in 1978. 
In 1980 he was hired by WMAR-TV to be the station's weekend anchor and reporter. He covered events such as the Wayne Williams trial in Atlanta (1981) and the Cuban refugee influx in Pennsylvania. In April 1982, Anderson was let go by WMAR-TV following a 90 day labor strike.
Though he interviewed for jobs at WSB-TV in Atlanta and WBZ-TV in Boston, Anderson chose not to move his family and remained in Baltimore. He ran for the House of Delegates while entering law school.
Legislative career.
In 1982, Anderson won a seat in the House of Delegates, finishing first in a crowded field of candidates which included four incumbents. He was sworn in January of 1983 and assigned to the House Ways and Means committee.
After serving five years in the Maryland General Assembly, Anderson was elected chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland. As chairman he sponsored and saw passed Maryland's Minoirty Business Enterprise Act. One of the benefits of this act for minority business was increased participation in major state projects like the building of Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Nearly 20% of the contracts let for the construction of the new ballpark went to minority owned businesses. After 12 years in the House, Anderson ran for the Senate in 1994 but was defeated in the democratic primary. He practiced law for the next 8 years. In 2002 he made a run for the House of Delegates. As before he was a non-incumbent running against four incumbents for three seats. Unlike his first race in 1982 where he beat all the incumbents and finished first, this time Anderson finished third with a razor thin 100 vote margin of victory over 4th place finisher incumbent Ken Montague. In the 2006 general election campaign, Anderson joined with 43rd district incumbents Senator Joan Carter Conway, and Delegates Maggie McIntosh and Ann Marie Doory to defeat a field of 6 other challengers.
Slots.
Since his return to the legislature in 2003, Anderson has been well known for his opposition to the introduction of slot machines in Annapolis. Delegate Anderson organized protests against slots, wrote newspaper editorials and took to the airwaves at several local radio and television stations to solidify opposition to bringing organized gambling into Maryland. In spite of strong support for slots by then Maryland Governor Robert Ehrlich, Anderson and his colleagues prevailed and a pro-slots bill never made it out of the House of Delegates though similar bills had passed the State Senate. In 2005, however, all that changed; both chambers passed different pro-slots bills. In the House of Delegates the measure passed by a 71–66 vote. In 2007 new Governor, Martin O'Malley, hinted at some marginal support for slots as a possible new revenue source. Although Anderson and O'Malley share party affiliations, Anderson remained a staunch opponent of bringing slots into Maryland.
Crime.
Curt Anderson is also the chairman of the House Judiciary's subcommittee on criminal justice, the House of Delegates' Special Committee on Drug and Alcohol and former chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland's committee on crime and justice. In 2003, Delegate Anderson was appointed to and currently serves on the Maryland State Commission on Criminal Sentencing Policy. His experiences from these positions as well as his background as a criminal defense attorney led him to the conclusion that most crime is just a symptom of the larger problem that society faces: drug addiction. In the 2007 session of the Maryland General Assembly, Anderson, therefore, introduced measures to increase drug treatment funding while requiring the state's courts to refer first time misdemeanor drug users to treatment. The initiative mirrors those adopted on the west coast under California Proposition 36. Anderson's other bill in the drug area represents a major change in Maryland drug policy, HB992, would have repealed the state's without parole provisions from the sentences of second time non-violent drug felons. Referencing the fact that nearly 90% of those incarcerated in Maryland for drug felonies are of African-American descent, Anderson has sought to create a racially equitable solution to the drug problem. The Maryland State Commission of Sentencing Guidelines is also considering changing sentencing guidelines for low level felony drug offenders. 
Although the bill passed both Houses, it sits on the Governor's desk and could be the subject of the new Governor's first veto. 
Additionally, Anderson was the House of Delegates floor leader on legislation that would automatically expunge the records of the thousands of young men who have been arrested in Baltimore City without being charged with a crime. In 2006 more than 21,000 people, mostly African-Americans, were arrested in Baltimore City and then released hours later without being charged with a crime. Existing Maryland law would allow them to have their records expunged of these arrests but not without signing a written waiver of rights or waiting for three years. HB-10 would make the expungement automatic with no waiver, no fee and no waiting period. It passed the Maryland House of Delegates on March 7, 2007, by a vote of 130- and signed into law on April 10, 2007.
Legislative notes.
Anderson was the primary sponsor of HB 1303-Vehicle Laws-Towing or removal from parking lots-Baltimore City, Baltimore County.(Chapter 462 of Laws enacted during the 1989 legislature) The bill was introduced following an epidemic of cars being towed from private lots in the Baltimore region, without warning to vehicle owners. The new law required each lot be posted with warnings, the possible cost of towing and the place to where the vehicle had been towed.
Following the 1989 Supreme Court decision in City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co. (ruling Richmond's MBE set asides unconstitutional), most states that had procurement laws for minority business (MBE) found that their laws were also unconstitutional. Anderson, then chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland, sponsored HB 1540-Minority Business Procurement (Chapter 708 of Laws enacted during the 1990 legislature), creating a constitutional framework for MBE procurement in Maryland.
Also in 1990, Anderson was the primary and sole sponsor of HB 328 which allowed retired judges to be called back into service for up to 90 days to help alleviate crowded court dockets. (Chapter 154 of Laws enacted during the 1990 legislature)
Maryland's first comprehensive DNA Profile bill was sponsored by Anderson in 1991. The bill set up state standards to be followed when DNA evidence was sought to be introduced in criminal trials in Maryland. Anderson's HB 1150 was signed into law on May 24, 1991. (Ch 631).
During the 1992 session, Anderson's HB178 was signed into law. The bill required that interpreters, for non-English speaking defendants, be provided in all of Maryland's courts.
In 1994, Anderson introduced a bill to raise the age after which a Maryland public school student could dropout from age 16 to age 18. The bill failed, but the Maryland General Assembly passed the same bill in 2012.
Anderson also sponsored legislation that would require the state's forensic laboratories be strictly monitored. The bill, which was signed by the Governor in 2007, proposed to ensure that the scientific reliability of forensic testimony could not be challenged due to a lack of appropriate standards and basic protocols. (became law Chapter 147)
That same year he was also the primary sponsor of HB 1071, creating child fatality review teams for the prevention of child deaths (became law Chapter 264) 
During the 2008 legislative session Anderson sponsored the Custodial Interrogation Act which requires law enforcement officers to electronically record interrogations in murder and rape cases that resulted in confessions. The bill was signed into law by the Governor in May 2008.
During the 2009 session of the Maryland General Assembly, Anderson introduced two bills aimed at strengthening Maryland's drunk driving laws: HB330 (Manslaughter and Vehicular Manslaughter -Penalties) and HB 212 (Preliminary Breath Test – Evidence). Anderson was the primary sponsor of HB66, revamping and updating Maryland's theft statute.( Chapter 655) he also sponsored several gun bills designed to decrease violent crime in Baltimore.
Anderson was the primary and sole sponsor of House Bill 1473 – Maryland's "BLUE Alert" system. A system similar to that of the AMBER alert but is activated when police officer has been killed or seriously wounded and the offender is still at large. Anderson's BLUE alert bill passed the House of Delegates with a 138–0 and passed the through the Maryland Senate with a 46–0 vote. Governor O'Malley signed the bill into law in May 2010, but then moved up its effective date by signing an executive order implementing the BLUE Alert system on June 22, 2010.
During the 2011 legislative session, Anderson was the sponsor of House Bill 241. Aimed at public safety, this bill added shotguns and rifles to the list of weapons for which a mandatory sentence is required. The bill also increased the sentencing to 15 years in prison. Anderson's House Bill 302, which also became law in 2011, changed Maryland's practice of parole approval. Maryland was one of the few states that left parole decisions, in life sentence cases, up to the Governor. Anderson's bill shifted those decisions to the parole board if the governor did not act on parole board recommendations. 
As chairman of the Baltimore City Delegation, Anderson was responsible for the Delegation's most important bill of the year- HB 860 (Baltimore City Public Schools Construction and Revitalization Act of 2013). Signed by the Governor on May 16, 2013, the new law approved 1.1 billion dollars to construct new schools in Baltimore City.
Activist in the Democratic Party.
Since entering the political realm Anderson has been active in the Democratic Party. He has been a member of the Mount Royal Democratic Club, the New Democratic Club (NDC2) and co-founder of the 43/44 Democratic Club all in Northeast Baltimore. In 1992, Anderson ran successfully as a Clinton delegate, from Maryland's 7th congressional district, and eventually cast his vote for Bill Clinton at the 1992 Democratic National Convention in New York. In 2003, he was co-chair of "Maryland Electeds for Howard Dean" and ran as a Dean delegate (Md 7th congressional district) in the Maryland presidential primary. Howard Dean had withdrawn from the race but Anderson made a strong showing, finishing just behind the John Kerry delegates. In July 2004, Anderson traveled to his home state of Illinois and spent a week campaigning for Barack Obama, who was running for the United States Senate. In 2006, Anderson took an active role in helping the Democratic party regain control of the Maryland Governor's mansion. He campaigned door to door for Martin O'Malley, Mayor of Baltimore, who was trying to unseat Republican incumbent Governor Robert Ehrlich. Anderson has also run Baltimore City-wide campaigns as well. He chaired Carl Stokes' mayoral bid in 1999, he spearheaded Question P in 2002 and was campaign manager for Larry Young, a candidate for President of the Baltimore City Council in 1987. During the 2007 session of the Maryland General Assembly, Anderson recruited many of his colleagues to endorse Illinois senator Barack Obama for President of the United States,
in December 2007, Anderson was chosen by the Obama Presidential campaign to appear on the ballot as a male delegate for Obama from Maryland's 7th congressional district. Anderson campaigned in South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland and Ohio for Obama, knocking on doors and phone banking. Anderson's oldest son, Curtis, was chairman of the Norfolk, Virginia for Obama campaign. In May 2008, the Maryland Democratic Party selected Anderson as an Obama PLEO delegate to the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.

San Yisheng

San Yisheng (Chinese: 散宜生; Pinyin: Sǎn Yìshēng) was an official of Zhou.
Plot in "Fengshen Yanyi".
Grand Counselor San has been renowned as the protector of both the Ji province and Ji Chang of Mount Singing Phoenix – who he has served for many upon many years. Throughout the many contributions of Commander/Grand Counselor San, he would be most remembered for subdueing Chong Houhu's coalition with a simple letter of rationality during the Su Hu arc. Even after Ji Chang had been imprisoned for over the time of seven years, San Yisheng would continue to remain as a loyal sword of the Ji province.
Once the news of Boyi Kao's death had reached the ears of the people of Mount Singing Phoenix, San would be the first to console the people and create a rational conclusion. The top priority would be to retrieve Ji Chang, and not go to war against the Shang dynasty yet. Thus, San would compose a letter to Supreme Counselors Fei Zhong and You Hun and effectively attain their consent that Ji Chang should be released for his loyalty and devotion to the king.

John Plunkett, 17th Baron of Dunsany

John William Plunkett, 17th Baron of Dunsany (31 August 1853 – 16 January 1899), whose seat was Dunsany Castle, County Meath, Ireland, was the second son of Edward Plunkett, 16th Baron of Dunsany (1808–1889), and Lady Anne Constance Dutton (1816–1858). 
John William Plunkett received a Bachelor of Arts Degree from Trinity College, Dublin (1877). He studied at Trinity College, Cambridge (B.A., 1878; M.A., 1881). He was Lieutenant R.N. Artillery Volunteers and a Conservative Party Member of Parliament for the Thornbury (or Southern) division of Gloucestershire from 1886 to 1892. He proved his right to vote at the elections of Representative Peers (Ireland) 1890 and Representative Peers (Ireland) 1893-99.
John William married on 3 April 1877, at St George's, Hanover Square, London, England, his second cousin, Ernle Elizabeth Louisa Maria Grosvenor Burton (later Ernle-Erle-Drax), the only daughter and heir to Colonel Francis Augustus Plunkett Burton, Coldstream Guards, by Sarah Frances Elizabeth, younger daughter and coheir of John Samuel Wanley Sawbridge-Erle-Drax, of Charborough Park, Dorset. Her paternal grandmother, the Hon. Anna Maria Plunkett, wife of Admiral James Ryder Burton, was a sister of her husband's paternal grandfather, Edward Wadding Plunkett, 13th Baron of Dunsany. In addition, Ernle, Lady Dunsany, was descended via her maternal line from James Drax, a young Englishman who, with a few hundred pounds, had sailed from the Port of London for Barbados in the late 1620s. There he had made a fortune developing sugar and slave-trading into a hugely profitable business. Just before the turn of the seventeenth century, the family returned to England and purchased an estate in Dorset. Lady Dunsany inherited Charborough Park in 1905. Her unusual Christian name, Ernle, was inherited from an ancestress, Elizabeth Ernle (1697–1759), wife of Henry Drax, Esq., who was the daughter and eventual heiress of Sir Edward Ernle, 3rd Baronet, P.C., M.P., (1673–1729) of Maddington, Wiltshire, by his wife, Frances (d. 1728) only daughter and heir of Lieutenant General Thomas Erle (1650–1720), of Charborough House, the source of a further barrel of her surname. 
John William and Ernle Elizabeth had two sons, Edward John Moreton Drax, 18th Baron of Dunsany and Admiral The Honourable Sir Reginald Aylmer Ranfurly Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax (Charborough Park was left to Reginald, who changed his name to include Drax, the family who had formerly owned it, as well as including references to the Ernle and Erle families from which various of his mother's legacies to him came).
Lady Dunsany was a cousin of Sir Richard Burton, the great traveller, scholar, writer, and translator of the "Arabian Nights." Her son and heir, Edward, may have inherited his imaginative streak from the Burton family.
John William was an exceptional sportsman, and was reputed to have been the best marksman in England. He was deeply interested in mechanical things and developed his own X-Ray machine, which was in operation in Dunsany Castle before his death in 1899. The Dunsany version of the Röntgen ray machine was given to Sevenoaks Hospital in 1918. He had acquired the right to drive the Irish Mail Train and regularly took charge of the branch line train from Dublin to Drumree, near Dunsany. He was also responsible for having the first Irish telephone system installed in Dunsany Castle.
The 17th Baron of Dunsany died after a short illness on 16 January 1899 at Dunsany Castle, aged forty-five years.
His widow, who by Royal Licence, 20 December 1905, assumed the names of Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, died at her residence, Dunstall Priory, Shoreham, near Sevenoaks, Kent, England, on 28 February 1916.

Australia Davis Cup team

The Australian Davis Cup team is the second most successful team ever to compete in the Davis Cup, winning the coveted title on 29 separate occasions, second behind the United States with 32.
Australia also participated in winning the Davis Cup five times with New Zealand under the alias Australasia (1905–1914).
History.
The beginning.
Australian players began playing Davis Cup in 1905 as a part of the Australasia Davis Cup team which also allowed players from New Zealand to compete on the same team. The team would win the Davis Cup on five occasions in 1907, 1908, 1909, 1911 and 1914. Despite players from New Zealand being eligible to represent Australasia, Tony Wilding would be the only New Zealander to play for the team while it existed. Following World War 1 the Australian Davis Cup team was born in 1919 and it assumed all the Australasian Davis Cup team records.
Australia and New Zealand have always been two separate countries, however the two countries did compete together under the alias Australasia in a number of sports including Davis Cup in the first couple of decades of the 20th century.
Australia won the Davis Cup in 1919 and has since played in 41 Davis Cup finals (including 1919) as of 2008, winning on 23 occasions.
Dominance.
From the era of 1937 to 1973 the only teams to win the Davis Cup were Australia and USA, in which 35 times were between one another. Australia won the Davis Cup title 16 times between these years in 1939, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1973.
The only decades that the team didn't win the Davis Cup was the 20's, 40's and the current decade. Australia were runner's up 8 times during the 20's and 40's.
After the 1973 victory Australia would go on to win the title another five times; 1977, 1983, 1986, 1999 and 2003. From 1999 to 2003, Australia got into the Final Round four times in 5 years but could only convert on these opportunities twice in 1999 and 2003.
2000 - 2009.
In 2003 after an inspirational semifinal against Switzerland where Lleyton Hewitt came back from two sets to love down against Roger Federer to win in five sets in the fourth rubber, to clinch a Davis Cup Final berth. In the Final, Australia defeated Spain 3–1 in front of a home crowd in Melbourne Park in which Mark Philippoussis defeated Juan Carlos Ferrero in five sets just months after Ferrero had reached the world number one ranking spot.
After Australia's 2003 win over Spain, Australia came into the 2004 Davis Cup with high hopes but the dreams were crushed when Sweden managed to beat Australia at home 4–1. Australia then had to play a world group qualifying match against Morocco which they won 4–1. Australia solidified their spot in the 2005 Davis Cup world group and breezed through their first round against Austria 5–0. Argentina was their next round opponents and Australia started off well with Lleyton Hewitt playing Guillermo Coria and in a shocking display of sportsmanship Hewitt won in four sets in front of a home crowd in Sydney. But Australia could not hold the lead and ended up losing the rest of their matches.
In 2006, Australia managed to defeat Switzerland 3–2 in the fifth rubber in the first round. Australia's quarterfinal was against Belarus in Melbourne and with Australia having Lleyton Hewitt back in the team, with Peter Luczak omitted. Australia celebrated after the second day after winning all matches and securing a semifinal spot, the first team to do so. Australia then went on to win the reverse singles making statement with a 5–0 victory over Belarus. Australia suffered a huge 5–0 loss to Argentina in the semifinals.
The 2007 Davis Cup could not have been any worse for Australia playing away in Belgium in their first tie against Belgium, losing their first two rubber Australia faced do or die in the doubles. Lleyton Hewitt was able to win both the doubles and his fourth rubber singles matches to bring the tie back to two all. Chris Guccione then lost in straight sets to put Australia in the world group playoffs. Australia drew Serbia in Serbia for their world group playoff and Serbia, having two of their singles players in the top 100, were clear favorites. After day one the tie was drawn at one all Australia lost their doubles match in four sets and looked in a bad position. Things only got worse for Australia as their top player Lleyton Hewitt came down with sickness and could not compete in the final day. Australia eventually ended up losing 4–1 overall, seeing Serbia into the world group for the first time; the result also saw Australia relegated for only the second time.
The 2008 Davis Cup saw Australia playing away for the fourth consecutive time, playing in Chinese Taipei. Australia beat Chinese Taipei 4–1 and were awarded a home 2nd Round rubber for the first time in almost two years. Australian easily accounted for Thailand winning the rubber 5–0. Australia then advanced to the world group playoffs where they were drawn to play away against Chile. Chile raced out to a 2–0 lead before Chris Guccione and Carsten Ball were able to bring the tie back to 2–1 after winning the doubles match. However in the 4th match Fernando González defeated Guccione in the reverse singles match to secure the tie. Australia managed to win the remaining dead rubber, with Chile winning the tie 3–2.
The 2009 Davis Cup saw a rematch of last year's second round match against Thailand. This time, Australia had to travel away and won 3–2, only securing the tie in the final rubber. For the second round match-up, Australia was drawn to play away against India. However due to security concerns in Chennai, Australia refused to play the tie in India, requesting the tie be played in a neutral country. After this request was denied, Australia withdrew from playing, so India advanced to the World Group Playoffs via forfeit.
Present.
The 2010 Davis Cup was a breeze for Australia in the Asia/Oceania playoffs, easily advancing to the World Group Playoffs. 5–0 defeats of Chinese Taipei in the first round in Melbourne and Japan in the second round in Brisbane led to Australia being drawn to play a home tie against Belgium. Played in hot and humid conditions in North Cairns, Australia led 2–1 after the doubles match. Lleyton Hewitt's win in the doubles match gave him the most wins by an Australian in Davis Cup history. After a five and a half hour rain delay, the reverse singles finally got under way, before being suspended midway through the first set. With Hewitt pulling out of his reverse singles match, Peter Luczak and Carsten Ball were unable to hold onto Australia's lead, going down to Belgium 3–2.
For the fourth year in a row, Australia started its 2011 Davis Cup campaign in the Asia/Oceania playoffs. After receiving a first round bye, Australia played away to China in the second round, whom they defeated 3–1. Australia then advanced to the 2011 Davis Cup World Group Play-offs where they received a home tie against seeded Switzerland. Played on grass at the Royal Sydney Golf Club in Sydney, Australia, Australia led 2–1 after victories by Tomic over Wawrinka in the singles and by Hewitt and Guccione in the doubles. However in the 1st reverse singles Tomic lost to Federer, tying the play-off at 2–2. In the decisive rubber Hewitt trailed 5–3 in the 5th set against Stanislas Wawrinka when play was suspended due to bad light. When play resumed the following morning, Hewitt was unable to hold serve as Switzerland won the tie 3–2.
Australia began its 2011 Davis Cup campaign once again in the Asia/Oceania playoffs. Australia easily accounted for China in the first round with a 5-0 victory in Geelong, Victoria, and again against South Korea in the semi-finals with a 5-0 win in Brisbane. Australia faced Germany away in Hamburg in the World Group Playoffs for a spot in next year's World Group. Leading 2-1 going into the reverse singles matches, Australia failed to win a match on the final day, losing the tie 3-2.
Australia's historic Davis Cup rivalry with the United States.
Australia and USA have played each other in the Davis Cup final on 29 different occasions. Having both teams dominate the competition for 36 years, Australia and USA had an intense rivalry in Davis Cup. In recent years the rivalry has waned, while the two teams have not played each other since 1999.

Jal Fazer

Jalander "Jal" Fazer is a fictional character in the television series "Skins" portrayed by Larissa Wilson.
Characterisation.
Jal is described by the official "Skins" website as "super bright and the most talented young clarinet player in the country". The daughter of fictional celebrity Ronny Fazer, she is easily the most affluent of all of her friends, of whom she is closest to Michelle Richardson and Chris Miles. As a highly talented and intellectual teenager, she defies various stereotypes. Her school is quick to take pride in (and responsibility for) her success, despite carrying little interest in the naturally gifted Jal. She is very straightforward and self-aware, and has contempt for her brothers' fake "ghetto" personas as well as Tony Stonem's poor treatment of Michelle, and the way in which Sid Jenkins ignores Cassie. Despite this, she can occasionally come across as something of a goody-goody, as several characters occasionally point out her preference for her clarinet over her friends, with Chris making a pact with her, in which she has to "stop saying "no" all the time."
According to her Myspace-style "about me" section on the "Skins" website she dislikes modern pop artists and wishes to "sue MTV Base for prolonged emotional distress". Her favourite "musical dynamics" are Dolce, Affettuoso, Rubato and Giocoso. Her other favourite things include eating chips, Maxxie Oliver's dancing, and the correlation between maths and music (Pythagorean triples). She is also incredibly driven, finding herself knowing more than her careers advisor, having planned out her future, and having to pass up a fifteen-minute interview in awkward silence.
Character history.
Series 1.
In "Jal", Jal anticipates her clarinet recital (for place of BBC Young Musician of the Year) and impresses all her friends by looking great. Her clarinet is broken by Sid's drug dealing enemy Madison Twatter who smashes it before being chased away by her brothers Ace and Lynton (who are subsequently beaten into hospital). Her dad surprises her by buying her a new clarinet and having Madison abducted (presumably killed). Later, in "Chris" it is revealed she did not win Young Musician of the Year and only received £25 to cover her traveling costs. She grows closer to Chris as he is abandoned by both parents and left homeless, whilst beginning to become aware of his drug addiction. In "Sid" she is critical of Sid for how he treats Cassie and is there to take Cassie to hospital after an overdose. She tells the doctors that she is Cassie's sister, and gets rid of Sid, with whom she is angry, hoping Cassie will recover. In the series finale, she dances with Kenneth at Anwar Kharral's birthday party and the two seem to grow closer. When Chris starts a brawl, she makes easy work in fighting some of the large male attackers.
Series 2.
In episode five of the second season, "Chris", we see Jal and Chris make a deal that Chris will give his life a go and stop saying 'fuck it' and Jal will stop saying no to everything, as Chris had previously told her in "Sid" that "you don't have sex at all. You have clarinet lessons." At a party that night, Jal shows her wilder side when Chris dares her to go and get the hat off the head of the singer at the party. She downs a can of beer and snogs the singer right on stage for his hat. Inevitably, she and Chris end up getting together. Angie turns up however, Chris pulls out of his romp in the toilet with her when he thinks of Jal. When coming out of the bathroom, Jal is there and puts two and two together. Chris then attempts to get Jal back and they get back together, however he doesn't yet know that Jal is pregnant with his baby. In the following episode, "Tony", she is seen in the club with the others but doesn't appear to drink alcohol. Tony tells her she is a bad liar and knows she has a secret. It isn't clear if she told him she was pregnant or not.
During episode eight, Jal's central episode, she continues to battle with the many decisions she needs to make in the foreseeable future. Whilst Jal struggles to decide when to reveal her pregnancy to boyfriend Chris, it is heavily hinted that Chris has a secret of his own. Half way through the episode, it is revealed that Cassie somehow knows of Jal's pregnancy. Michelle and Jal's dysfunctional family discover her secret shortly after. The next day, Jal heads for a musical audition at a prestigious college of arts, and performs well. However, when she returns home, she discovers Cassie looking anxious sitting on the table in the apartment. They both head to the hospital where it is revealed that Chris is suffering from the same illness that killed his brother.
In episode nine, Jal appears at Sid's dinner party, and reveals that she is pregnant, and plans to have an abortion.
In the series 2 finale, Jal reveals that she had an abortion. She can barely face getting out of bed on the day of Chris' funeral.
However, Chris' dad banned all of his friends from attending the funeral, worried about embarrassment to the family. Chris' friends decide to watch the funeral from afar, whilst Jal makes this touching speech:
Her story ends with Jal sitting by Chris' grave crying as Chris' dad offers his condolences.

San Francisco (Tor Endresen song)

"San Francisco" was the Norwegian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1997, performed in Norwegian - with some lyrics in English - by Tor Endresen.
The song is a moderately up-tempo number, with a sound similar to rock music from the late 1960s. Endresen delivers a paean to San Francisco as an idealised paradise from that decade, with lyrics containing many references to slogans ("Make love not war"), people (Jimi Hendrix and John Lennon) and song titles ("California Dreamin'", "Blowin' in the Wind") from that era, as well as key events such as the moon landing and the Woodstock festival.
The chorus further idealises the city and the period, with it being described as "A time of peace, a spring of youth/No guns, no war, no disco/Just lovely flowers in your hair".
The song was performed third on the night, following Turkey's Şebnem Paker & Grup Ethnic with "Dinle" and preceding Austria's Bettina Soriat with "One Step". At the close of voting, it had received the dreaded "nul points", placing 24th (joint last) in a field of 25 and further extending Norway's unwanted record of recording zero points on the most occasions. Additionally, as the result followed on a second place and a victory, Norway achieved a dramatic reversal of fortunes.
Prior to the next Contest, the decision was taken to restrict entry to the 18 countries with the best average score over the previous five years, a group which included Norway courtesy of Secret Garden's victory in 1995 and Elisabeth Andreassen's second-place the year after. Thus, the song was succeeded as Norwegian representative at the 1998 contest by Lars Fredriksen with "Alltid sommer".

Amos Beebe Eaton

Amos Beebe Eaton (May 12, 1806 – February 21, 1877) was a career officer in the United States Army, serving as a general for the Union during the American Civil War.
Biography.
Amos B. Eaton was born in Catskill, New York. He graduated from West Point in 1826; he was an infantry lieutenant until the Florida campaigns of the late 1830s. After that, his only fighting experiences took place in the Mexican-American War, for which service he was appointed a brevet major. Eaton served for 12 years as a field officer in the U.S. Army, then joined the commissary department for 23 years.
Appointed a lieutenant colonel and assistant commissary general in 1861, Eaton was given the task of creating an effective supply system for the fledgling Union army. The large number of troops entering the Army at the beginning of the war was overloading the existing system. His work provisioning and distributing supplies to the troops led to President Abraham Lincoln's July 6, 1864 appointment of Eaton to the rank of brigadier general, U.S. Army, to rank from June 29, 1864. President Lincoln formally nominated Eaton for the appointment on June 30, 1864 and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on July 2, 1864. Eaton took over the position of commissary general of the Regular Army at the same time due to the death of Brigadier General Joseph P. Taylor on June 29, 1864. On March 8, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Eaton for appointment to the brevet grade of major general to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the nomination on May 4, 1866 and re-confirmed it on July 14, 1866 in order to have line officers precede staff officers in rank. He retired May 1, 1874, with the grade of brigadier general, USA, and commissary general of subsistence. He then moved to New Haven, Connecticut. Eaton died in New Haven, on February 21, 1877, and was buried there.
Relations.
His daughter Frances Spencer Eaton married Charles Atwood White, the great-grandson of American founding father Roger Sherman. They were the parents of U.S. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson's wife Mabel Wellington Stimson and women's suffrage leader Elizabeth Selden Rogers. Eaton is the son of Amos Eaton.

Romesh Chunder Dutt

Romesh Chunder Dutt, CIE () was an Indian civil servant, economic historian, writer, and translator of "Ramayana" and "Mahabharata".
Formative years.
Dutt was born into a distinguished Bengali Kayastha family well known for its members' literary and academic achievements. His parents were Thakamani and Isam Chunder Dutt. His father, Isam Dutt, was a Deputy Collector of Bengal, whom Romesh often accompanied on official duties. Romesh was educated in various Bengali District schools, then at Hare School, Calcutta, founded by the philanthropist, David Hare. After his father's untimely death in a boat accident in eastern Bengal, Romesh's uncle, Shoshee Chunder Dutt, an accomplished writer, became his guardian in 1861. Romesh wrote about his uncle, "He used to sit at night with us and our favorite study used to be pieces from the works of the English poets." He was a relative of Toru Dutt, one of nineteenth century Bengal's most prominent poets.
He entered the University of Calcutta, Presidency College in 1864, then passed the First Arts examination in 1866, second in order of merit, and won a scholarship. While still a student in the B.A. class, without his family's permission, he and two friends, Behari Lal Gupta and Surendranath Banerjee, left for England in 1868. Only one other Indian, Satyendra Nath Tagore, had ever before qualified for the Indian Civil Service. Romesh aimed to emulate Satyendranath Tagore's feat. For a long time, before and after 1853, the year the ICS examination was introduced in England, only British officers were appointed to covenanted posts. The 1860s saw the first attempts, largely successful, on the part of the Indians, and especially members of the Bengali intelligentsia, to occupy the superior official posts in India, until then completely dominated by the British.
At University College London, Dutt continued to study British writers. He studied law at Middle Temple, London, was called to the bar, and qualified for the Indian Civil Service in the open examination in 1869, taking third place.
Civil service.
Dutt entered the Indian Civil Service, or ICS, as an Assistant Magistrate of Alipur in 1871. His official career was a test and a proof of the liberal promise of equality to all her Majesty's subjects "irrespective of color and creed" in Queen Victoria's Proclamation of November 1, 1858, which often contrasted with an implicit distrust of Indians, especially from those in positions of authority within the elite colonial administrative system.
A famine in Meherpur, District of Nadia in 1874 and another in Dakhin Shahbazpur (Bhola District) in 1876, followed by a disastrous cyclone, required emergency relief and economic recovery operations, which Dutt managed successfully. By December, 1882, Dutt achieved his appointment to the executive branch of the Service, the first Indian to achieve executive rank. He served as administrator for Backerganj, Mymensingh, Burdwan, Donapur, and Midnapore. He became Burdwan's District Officer in 1893, Commissioner ("offtg".) of Burdwan Division in 1894, and Divisional Commissioner for Orissa in 1895. Dutt was the first Indian to attain the rank of divisional commissioner.
As Dutt's biographer commented, "In the absence of even the rudiments of representative institutions entry into the higher Civil Services presented the only opportunity to an Indian to influence the government of his own country." He sat for a time in the Bengal Legislative Council. Although he won high praise for his administrative work, and the Companionship of the Indian Empire was awarded him in 1892, Dutt did not always agree with official views on the causes of poverty in India or on the problems of administration. As his official recommendations and reports reflected, Dutt was especially troubled by the lack of assured tenants' rights or rights of transfer for those who tilled the land. He considered the land taxes to be ruinous, a block to savings, and the source of famines. He also felt the effectiveness of administrators was limited by the absence of representative channels for the concerns of the population being governed.
Dutt retired from the ICS as the Commissioner of Orissa in 1897 while only 49 years of age. Retirement freed him to enter public life and pursue writing. After retirement in 1898 he returned to England as a Lecturer in Indian History at University College, London where he completed his famous thesis on economic nationalism. He spent the next six years in London before returning once again to India as Dewan of Baroda state, a post he had been offered before he left for Britain. He was extremely popular in Baroda where the Maharaja, Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III and his family members and all other staff used to call him the Babu Dewan, as a mark of personal respect. He also became a member of the Royal Commission on Indian Decentralisation in 1907.
While still in office, he died in Baroda at the age of 61 on November 30, 1909.
Politics.
He was active in moderate nationalist politics and was an active Congressman in that party's initial phase. He was president of the Indian National Congress in 1899.
Literature.
Bengali culture.
Dutt served as the first president of Bangiya Sahitya Parishad () in 1894, while Rabindranath Tagore and Navinchandra Sen were the vice-presidents of the society. This was the society founded by L. Leotard and Kshetrapal Chakraborty in 1893 to cultivate Bengali literature. Enriched by contributions from Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar and others, its collections include over 150,000 books and important Bengali and Sanskrit manuscripts and cultural artifacts, including the only manuscript of Shrikrsnakirtana.
Dutt's "The Literature of Bengal" presented "a connected story of literary and intellectual progress in Bengal" over eight centuries, commencing with the early Sanskrit poetry of Jayadeva. It traced Chaitanya's religious reforms of the sixteenth century, Raghunatha Siromani's school of formal logic, and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's brilliance, coming down to the intellectual progress of the nineteenth century. 
This was presented by Thacker, Spink & Co. in Calcutta and Archibald Constable in London in 1895, but it had formed in Dutt's mind while he managed famine relief and economic recovery operations in Dakhin Shahbazpur and had appeared originally under the disguise of an assumed name in 1877. It was dedicated to his esteemed uncle, Rai Shashi Chandra Dutt Bahadur.
Dutt considered Ram Mohan Roy, the religious reformer of Bengal, Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar and Akshay Kumar Datta to be the founders of Bengali prose literature
History.
Increased poverty and lower wages were among the indirect products of colonial rule according to Dutt. Romesh Dutt traced a decline in standards of living to the nineteenth-century deindustrialization of the subcontinent and the narrowing of sources of wealth which followed:
India in the eighteenth century was a great manufacturing as well as great agricultural country, and the products of the Indian loom supplied the markets of Asia and of Europe. It is, unfortunately, true that the East Indian Company and the British Parliament ... discouraged Indian manufactures in the early years of British rule in order to encourage the rising manufactures of England . . . millions of Indian artisans lost their earnings; the population of India lost one great source of their wealth.
Radhakamal Mukerjee and Romesh Dutt directed attention to the deepening internal differentiation of Indian society appearing in the abrupt articulation of local economies with the world market, accelerated urban-rural polarization, the division between intellectual and manual labor, and the toll of recurrent devastating famines.

<doc id="9657023" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9657023" title="Tracking (education)">
Tracking (education)

Tracking is separating pupils by academic ability into groups for all subjects or certain classes and curriculum within a school. It may be referred to as streaming or phasing in certain schools. In a tracking system, the entire school population is assigned to classes according to whether the students' overall achievement is above average, normal, or below average. Students attend academic classes only with students whose overall academic achievement is the same as their own.
Among older students, tracking systems usually diverge in what students are taught. Students in academically advanced tracks study higher mathematics, more foreign languages, and literature. Students in less academic tracks acquire vocational skills such as welding or cosmetology, or business skills, such as typing or bookkeeping. Students are usually not offered the opportunity to take classes deemed more appropriate for another track, even if the student has a demonstrated interest and ability in the subject.
Ability grouping is "not" synonymous with tracking. Tracking differs from ability grouping by scale and permanence. Ability groups are small, informal groups formed within a single classroom. Assignment to an ability group is often short-term (never lasting longer than one school year), and varies by subject. Assignment to an ability group is made by (and can be changed at any time by) the individual teacher, and is usually not recorded in student records. For example, a teacher may divide a typical mixed-ability classroom into three groups for a mathematics lesson: those who need to review basic facts before proceeding, those who are ready to learn new material, and those who need a challenging assignment. For the next lesson, the teacher may revert to whole-class, mixed-ability instruction, or may assign students to different groups.
Tracking was once popular in English-speaking countries, but is less used now. Strong tracking systems formed the basis of the Tripartite System in England and Wales until the 1970s, and in Northern Ireland until 2009. Germany uses a strongly tracked system. In Germany, students' achievements in their last of generally four years of primary school determine the type of secondary school they will be permitted to attend, and therefore the type of education they will receive. Weak tracking systems have been used in American schools. In this approach, local schools assign students to classrooms according to their overall achievement, so that a given classroom is primarily composed of students with either high, average, or low academic achievement.
History of tracking.
Tracking and its various modifications is among the predominant organizing practices of American public schools, and has been an accepted feature in the country's schools for nearly a century. Coming into use at a time when schools were enrolling growing numbers of immigrant children as the result of compulsory schooling laws, tracking was adopted as a means of sorting those children viewed as having limited preparation or capacity for schooling from native children. Unfortunately, however, tracking quickly took on the appearance of internal segregation.
The types of tracks have changed over the years. Traditionally, there were academic, general, and vocational tracks, identified by the kind of preparation they provide. By the 1920s, some schools had developed up to eight distinctly labeled tracks that represented particular curricular programs that reflected as assessment of students’ probable social and vocational futures. Many secondary schools now base track levels on course difficulty, with tracks such as basic, honors, or college-prep. Primary schools might track in terms of high, average, or lower ability. As noted by Oakes and Martin, "school policies determine three structural qualities of the tracking system: "extensiveness" (the number of subjects tracked and the type of distinct curricula offered); "specificity" (the number of track levels offered); and "flexibility" (whether students move from one track to another)". Although, in theory, track assignment is based on academic ability, other factors often influence placement.
Origins of race-based tracking in school desegregation.
The "Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka" Supreme Court ruling of 1954 determined that the separate school statute established by "Plessy v. Ferguson" was unconstitutional, but a plan was not set forth for desegregating schools until the following year with the "Brown II" case. For schools in most southern regions of the United States, integration did not occur until the early 1970s. Mickelson (2003) stated that tracking was used as a tool to maintain white privilege by placing African-American students in lower academic tracks in Charlotte, North Carolina public schools after the "Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg" desegregation ruling. Haney (1978) did a historical analysis on the negative effects of desegregation on African-American educators. At the secondary school level, African-American teachers or less qualified white teachers were assigned to teach African American students. Teachers in lower tracks were also found to be less organized in preparing lessons and taught fewer concepts to students (Oakes, 1987).
The origins of race-based tracking actually reach as far back as the federal court ruling in "Roberts v. The City of Boston" in 1850, a case that upheld separate school curriculums for blacks and whites on the belief in inherent racial differences in intelligence (Harvard Law Review, 1989). During the mid- to late-1980s, there were a few federal court cases in the Mississippi and Georgia the involved unfair race-based tracking in school systems. "Quarles v. Oxford Municipal Separate School District", "NAACP v. Georgia", and "Montgomery v. Starkville Municipal Separate School District" each ruled in favor of school districts based on the argument that socioeconomic status was a legitimate reason for tracking. Courts also held the belief that racial discrimination in education was a thing of the past by the 1980s (Harvard Law Review, 1989). Unfortunately, in rural areas of Mississippi and Georgia, African-Americans were made of a large proportion of low income students, placing them in lower academic tracks. As late as 2009, Childers (in press) found that in a successful Ohio high school that was majority African-American, students of color were still placed in lower academic tracks at a rate that did not reflect the student population. The argument for the proliferation of African-Americans in lower tracks was student choice rather than racially based practices of administrators (Childers, in press).
Track assignment.
The ways by which students are assigned to tracks and the amount of fluidity within the tracking system varies by school and occurs in a variety of manners within individual schools. While some schools assign students to a particular track and do not allow for mobility between tracks, other schools allow students to be placed into an advanced class for one subject and a lower-ranking class for another. Non-academic factors such as schedule conflicts often affect students' track assignments as well.
Within some schools, tracking occurs in a variety of manners. Secondary schools, in general, tend to assign students to high tracks based on objective criteria, while low-track students are often placed using more-arbitrary measures. In some cases, placement is based entirely on student decision. In secondary schools in particular, test scores from primary schools may be used to determine a student's secondary track. Counselors may also work with students to choose a particular class that in turn puts them on a given track. In both primary and secondary schools, parents and peers may influence academic choices even more than guidance counselors, by encouraging students with similar backgrounds, whether academic, vocational, ethnic, religious, racial, etc., to stay together. Additionally, grouping may be done by teacher and counselor recommendation without the students' knowledge of any difference in course sections available. Though this is sometimes the case, students are often aware of ability grouping that occurs in this manner.
Advantages.
Proponents of tracking say that tracking has several important strengths. A major advantage of tracking is that it allows teachers to better direct lessons toward the specific ability level of the students in each class. While tracking for regular instruction makes no real difference in scholastic achievement for low and average ability students, it does produce substantial gains for gifted students in tracks specially designed for the gifted and talented. Tracking meets the need for highly gifted students to be with their intellectual peers in order to be appropriately challenged and to view their own abilities more realistically.
Tracking has been refined to lean more towards a subject by subject basis rather that a person by person basis. This means that students could be in classes with their peers, as to math vs. English. Maybe a student is at a higher level in math and in a class with advanced math students, but they may be in a lower English level and are grouped with peers at their level in English.
Another positive aspect of tracking is that since it separates students by ability, students' work is only compared to that of similar-ability peers, preventing a possible lowering of their self-esteem that could result from comparisons with the work of higher ability students, or inflating the egos of the high-ability students when compared to low-ability, same-age students. Since high self-esteem is correlated with high academic achievement, tracking should, theoretically, promote academic success. However, the awareness by the student of being placed into a low track might lower self-esteem and vice-versa.
Supporters of tracking also note that it allows for higher achievement of high-ability students. Kulik and Kulik (1992) found that high-ability students in tracked classes achieved more highly than similar-ability students in non-tracked classes. Similarly, Rogers (1991) recommends that gifted and talented students spend the majority of their school day with ability peers. In 1982 and 1990, the Kuliks also found a moderate improvement in attitude toward subject material for "all" ability levels. Another factor of ability grouping that has been advocated is the Joplin Plan that refers directly to ability grouping for reading. These groups are generally more interchangeable and less defined.
In another study, Argys, Rees, and Brewer (1996) found that high-track students’ achievement dropped when lower-ability students were integrated into the same class. Both of these studies suggest that tracking is beneficial to high-track students. Tracking can also encourage low-ability students to participate in class since tracking separates them from intimidation of the high-ability students. Some supporters of tracking also view tracking as an effective means of allocation since it helps direct students into specific areas of the labor market.
Rogers classifies tracking as one of ten types of grouping. High ability groups are often assigned special work that is more advanced than that of the other students in the class. For gifted children, such advanced work contributes to their social and emotional well-being.
Disadvantages.
Despite the positive aspects of tracking, some scholars have noted limitations of the system. Tracking often does not work as effectively as it should because of the composition of the tracks. In practice, tracks are generally not as homogeneous as they could be
(although they are more homogenous than a non-tracking system, which randomly assigns students to classrooms), so some of the potential benefits can't be fully exploited. Even when tracks initially are nearly homogeneous in students' academic abilities, heterogeneity can develop over time, since students learn at different rates. Some systems reassess all students periodically to keep students of comparable ability together as they progress.
Low-track classes tend to be primarily composed of low-income students, usually minorities, while upper-track classes are usually dominated by students from socioeconomically successful groups. In 1987, Jeannie Oakes theorized that the disproportionate placement of poor and minority students into low tracks does not reflect their actual learning abilities. Rather, she argues that the ethnocentric claims of social Darwinists and the Anglo-Saxon-driven Americanization movement at the turn of the century combined to produce a strong push for "industrial" schooling, ultimately relegating the poorer minority students to vocational programs and a differentiated curriculum which she considered a lingering pattern in 20th century schools. In addition to the unequal placement of students into tracks, there is evidence to support the assertion that the appointment of teachers to classes is disproportionate. The most-experienced, highest-status teachers are often assigned to teach high-track classes, whereas less-experienced teachers are usually assigned to low-track classes. Teachers of the high-track courses were found to be more enthusiastic in teaching, better at providing explanations, and more organized than teachers of low-track courses.
Scholars have also found that curricula often vary widely among tracks, as might be expected. While the enrichment and/or acceleration of curricula is considered to be a major benefit to gifted and talented students., lessons taught in low-track classes often lack the engagement and comprehensiveness of the high-track lessons, reflecting their more remedial nature. This can put low-track students at a disadvantage for college acceptance because they often do not gain the knowledge and skills of the upper-track students, presuming they could and would if not taught under a tracked system. Oakes (1985) found that in high-track classes, teachers often used course materials and taught concepts which required extensive critical-thinking skills, whereas teachers in low-track classes tended to draw heavily from workbooks and rarely assign work that required critical thinking. "But tracking described by Oakes in 1985 had little to do with educating gifted and talented children." In general, curricula of high-track courses are much more intensive and in-depth than those of low-track courses, as would be expected. Teachers reported spending less time addressing disciplinary issues in high-track classrooms than in low-track classes. The connection between low-track students and perceived behavioral concerns has been reported frequently. Teachers in these instances often suggest that more time is required to promote proper student behavior over the development of critical thinking and independent learning.
Some studies suggest that tracking can influence students' peer groups and attitudes regarding other students. Gamoran's study (1992) shows that students are more likely to form friendships with other students in the same tracks than students outside of their tracks. Since low-class and minority students are overrepresented in low tracks with Whites and Asians generally dominating high tracks, interaction among these groups can be discouraged by tracking. However, there is no research showing an academic benefit to low track students from such interaction.
Tracking can also result in a stigmatization of low-track students. In some cases, this stigmatization is thought to have a negative impact on students' academic performance and to influence students' attitudes. In one study, it was found that, among low-achieving students, students in tracked classes were more likely than students in non-tracked classes to believe that "their fate was out of their hands." According to Carol Dweck, this could be because their teachers impose upon them a 'fixed mindset,' but it is not an inherent attribute of tracking itself. Dweck implies that teachers who promote a growth mindset could stimulate students to greater academic achievement regardless of tracking. So whether a fixed mindset is predictive of, or resulting from, a low track assignment is unknown.
The effects of social stigmatization can be some of the worst outcomes for students in lower academic tracks. Schafer and Olexa (1971) interviewed high school students in lower academic tracks to examine the effects of tracking on self-esteem and perceived academic competence. They found that students lost confidence in their abilities by their placements in low-ability classes in which teacher expectations for them were low. These dilemmas were very common as students made transitions to new schools (e.g., elementary to middle school, middle to high school). The tracking of African-American students in elementary schools reflected remnants of early desegregation in which African-American secondary school teachers were demoted to teaching in lower grades (Haney, 1978). In these elementary schools, class-based tracking disproportionately placed African-American students in lower tracks with African-American teachers, regardless of ability. In transitions to middle and high school, tracking by ability created a division among these students and stripped students in lower tracks of their perceived academic efficacies. Goodlad (1983) and Oakes (1985) found that students in lower tracks were more likely to drop out of school or participate in criminal activities. Proponents of tracking would have said that students dropped out due to lack of ability, but Mickelson (2003) stated that students differed widely even within lower tracks. Even when students demonstrated high academic ability, it was virtually impossible to change their academic tracks without delaying high school graduation (Mickelson, 2003).
International Perspective.
Across countries there are wide differences in the use of formal tracking systems. Even though some countries track students into differing-ability schools by age 10, others such as the United States keep their entire secondary-school system comprehensive. Eric Hanushek and Ludger Woessmann identify the impact of tracking by comparing differences in student outcome between primary and secondary school across tracked and non-tracked systems. The results suggest that early tracking increases educational inequality. While less clear, there is also a tendency for early tracking to reduce mean performance.
"A Small Act" and similarities to class-based tracking abroad.
The 2010 HBO documentary, "A Small Act", documented the difficulty of Kenyan students being able to afford attending secondary schools. These elite schools were viewed as pathway to law school, medical school, and other forms of advanced education. Students who were kicked out of school for insufficient funds were fated to lives of poverty. In Kenya, having only a primary school education prepared one for menial labor, while secondary school equated to future social mobility for poor Kenyan children.
The Kenyan system of education closely mirrored tracking in American high schools where students in college-preparatory tracks were able to attend four-year universities immediately after graduation and vocationally tracked students could only enter community colleges and technical schools. Middle-class Kenyans were more likely to complete secondary schools and attend college, similar to college-preparatory students in the United States. Despite displaying promising academic ability, both low track students in the United States and poor children in Kenya can be at disadvantages in their educational advancement. For those in the United States, they acquire vocational skills at the sacrifice of reaching their full academic potential and the job security of a college education. The prospects for poor children in Kenya are even worse, having acquired few job skills in their primary school education.
Poor children in Kenya did have the opportunity to gain admission to secondary schools through merit scholarships, which required that students attained satisfactory scores on entrance examinations. There were indeed opportunities for bright poor children, but merit scholarships were limited in the number of students who could be awarded. In the United States, bright students in vocational tracks can enroll in two-year universities, but they lack the scholarships and post-secondary funding of their college-preparatory counterparts. Vocational students negotiate with the burden of scant financial support for college, and poor Kenyan children have the stress of passing entrance examinations even if they have academic ability similar to that of middle-class children or those in college-preparatory tracks.
Detracking.
Detracking occurs when students are deliberately positioned into classes of mixed ability. As opposed to tracking, students are no longer placed in groups based upon academic achievement or ability. Tracking can be associated with giving students in low-track classes less resources, fewer experienced teachers, low expectations, and unchallenging curricula. Proponents for detracking believe that low-track students will greatly benefit in school achievement if they are mixed in with high-track students.
Benefits of detracking.
Critics of tracking such as Kevin Welner say that detracking will help close the class-based and race-based achievement gap. Often students in low-track classes are disadvantaged racial and ethnic minority students. Those in favor of detracking say that detracking challenges social views about race and intelligence.
Tracking has been shown to produce less academic achievement for low-ability students, and higher academic achievement for high-ability students; de-tracking would increase the achievement of the worst students and harm the achievement of the best students. Critics say that not challenging all students with the most advanced curriculum results in overall low student educational achievement, and that students in low tracks do not learn as much as their peers in higher tracks, e.g., advanced mathematics.
Teachers typically have higher expectations for students in high-track classes and low expectations for students in low-tracked classes, which affects the self-image of students.
Concerns of detracking.
Detracking has been proven to reduce the achievement of students who would otherwise be placed in high-track classes. Parents of high-ability students and other proponents of tracking say that academically gifted students should have access to classes that maximize their potential. Detracking holds back high-ability students because teachers must reduce the amount and complexity of material so that all students in the class, including low-ability students, can understand it. Putting all students together in a heterogeneous group makes the teacher's job more difficult by increasing the range of performance of the students in a class.
In addition, how the teacher perceives students' academic abilities determines how detracking is carried out in the classroom. For example, in a school with many disadvantaged students, teachers assumed most students had low ability, and therefore the classroom curriculum was easier than what the students were capable of achieving. On the other side, in a wealthy school, teachers typically assumed students were college-bound and intelligent, and followed a creative and challenging curriculum.
Proposed reforms.
Maureen Hallinan offers many suggestions for reforming the tracking system and counterbalancing its perceived negative consequences. Although tracking can segregate students by race and socioeconomic status, she says that, by ensuring that students are engaged in integrated settings during the school day, some of the negative effects of the segregation could be avoided. Some studies suggest that low-track students often have slower academic growth than high-track students, but Hallinan says that providing more-engaging lessons in class, altering assumptions about students, and raising requirements for students' performance could help. Research is needed in this area to test her hypotheses. In order to prevent stigmatization of low-track students, Hallinan suggests that schools challenge low-track students to achieve highly and should offer public rewards for gains in academic achievement. Such rewards would be necessary in all tracks to avoid the perception of unfairness.
Heterogeneous class assignment with part-time homogeneous groupings is one possible compromise.

Epistemological solipsism

Epistemological solipsism is the variety of idealism according to which only the directly accessible mental contents of the solipsistic philosopher can be known. The existence of other minds and the external world generally is regarded as an unresolvable question, although this doesn't negate the probability of its existence.
Epistemological solipsists claim that realism begs the question: assuming there is a universe that is independent of the agent's mind, the agent can only ever know of this universe through the agent's senses. How is the existence of the independent universe to be scientifically studied? If a person sets up a camera to photograph the moon when they are not looking at it, then at best they determine that there is an image of the moon in the camera when they eventually look at it. Logically, this does not assure that the moon itself (or even the camera) existed at the time the photograph is supposed to have been taken. To establish that it is an image of an independent moon requires many other assumptions that amount to begging the question.
This relates to Kantian transcendental aspects of the world, in which a new factor can be included, once it is clear that the current axioms neither support nor refute it. The continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice, are examples of possible transcendental decision points. Solipsism in its weak form is characterized by the repeated decision to not take transcendental steps, a logical minimalism. In its strong form, the denial of the existence of an argument for the existence of an independent universe may be justified in principle in an empirical manner. Whether the nonexistence of a proof means the nonexistence of the entity is a transcendental choice.

Greenbelt Alliance

Greenbelt Alliance is a non-profit land conservation and urban planning organization that has worked in California's nine-county San Francisco Bay Area since 1958. 
Greenbelt Alliance promotes the creation of walkable neighborhoods with a mix of shops, homes, and jobs near public transit. The organization encourages cities to adopt smart growth policies, to accommodate the Bay Area's increasing population while protecting open space and making the region's cities better places to live. It has been involved in the adoption of urban growth boundaries in more than 20 cities and 5 counties in the Bay Area. These boundaries draw a line to define where growth should and should not go, and are generally either adopted by voters through the initiative process, or by city councils or county boards of supervisors.
Greenbelt Alliance works to get Bay Area residents involved in their local urban planning processes and development decisions. To help people learn more about the region's open space and its cities, the organization leads hikes, farm tours, and urban walks throughout the Bay Area that are open to the public. It also endorses development proposals that meet smart growth guidelines and include homes people can afford.
Greenbelt Alliance publishes reports on land use policy, affordable housing, smart growth, sprawl development, open space protection, and farming. 
Recent publications include:
Greenbelt Alliance is involved in statewide efforts in California to fight climate change through better land use. This is based on the idea that transportation is the largest contributor of greenhouse gases, and transportation is dictated by land use. Put another way, if homes and jobs are built far apart, people will drive more, and that will have a negative impact on the Earth's climate. Greenbelt Alliance advocates for changing how cities are built—focusing new development in downtowns and around transit stations—to reduce driving and so reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
History.
Greenbelt Alliance was founded in 1958 as an organization called Citizens for Regional Recreation and Parks. One of its first campaigns was helping to halt the filling of San Francisco Bay for development. In 1969, the organization was renamed People for Open Space to reflect the organization's additional interest in preserving ranch lands, agricultural lands, and wildlife preserves. In the 1970s, People for Open Space helped to establish a public park district called the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District (1972), as well as Suisun Marsh (1974). It was also involved in campaigning for a regional government for the Bay Area, but was defeated in Sacramento by one vote. In 1976, People for Open Space added the goal of establishing a permanent regional greenbelt to its agenda, and in 1984 created a group called Greenbelt Congress to work on open space protection through activism and grassroots organizing. 
In 1987, Greenbelt Congress and People for Open Space merged to become Greenbelt Alliance, and established a dual focus of grassroots activism and policy research. Greenbelt Alliance expanded outside San Francisco with a field office in the South Bay in 1988. In 1995, East Bay and Sonoma-Marin field offices opened their doors, and in 2001, a Solano-Napa office opened in response to growth along the Interstate 80 corridor between San Francisco and Sacramento.
In the 1990s and 2000s, Greenbelt Alliance was involved in stopping sprawl development proposals and protecting Pleasanton Ridge (1993), Bear Creek Redwoods(1999), and Cowell Ranch/John Marsh SHP (2002) as state parks or open space preserves. It helped to create the Santa Clara County Open Space Authority in 1994, and was part of defeating a freeway proposal called the Mid-State Toll Road in 1995. 
Greenbelt Alliance has acted as the fiscal sponsor for several organizations, including: the Transportation and Land Use Coalition (now an independent organization); the Bay Area Open Space Council; the San Francisco Housing Action Coalition; and the Bay Area Environmental Education Resource Fair.

Thomas Anthony Thacher

Thomas Anthony Thacher (January 11, 1815 - April 7, 1886) was an American classicist and college administrator.
Early life.
Thomas A. Thacher was born in Hartford, Conn., the son of Anne (née Parks) and Peter Thacher. His first American ancestor on his father's side was Thomas Thacher who emigrated from England to Massachusetts in 1635, and later became minister of the Old South Church in Boston; on his mother's side he was descended from the Rev. Thomas Buckingham of Saybrook, one of the founders of the Collegiate School of Connecticut, since known as Yale College. He had his preparatory training at the Hopkins Grammar School, Hartford, and graduated from Yale with the class of 1835; where he was a member of Skull and Bones.
Career.
For a short time he held a temporary teaching position in New Canaan, Connecticut, and then went to a school in Georgia, which was later to become Oglethorpe University. In all he spent three years teaching in two academies in Georgia, returning to Yale College on Dec. 1, 1838, to take the position of tutor. He was appointed assistant professor of Latin and Greek in 1842 and one year later the title was restricted to Latin and he was given a year's leave of absence for study in Europe. This year was eventually extended to two years and from 1843 to 1845 he studied in Germany and Italy. While in Berlin he instructed the Crown Prince of Prussia, and his cousin, Prince Frederick Charles. Six years after his return to Yale he was made professor of Latin. He was long a trustee of Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven and was a member of the state board of education 1866-77. He was on the committee for building the Yale Art School, serving with President Noah Porter and Professor Daniel Coit Gilman [qq.v.].
Thacher was identified with Yale College more closely than any of his contemporaries. President Timothy Dwight V said of him, ""His influence with the Faculty and the Corporation equaled or even surpassed that of any other College officer."" This extraordinary position was due not primarily to his scholarship, although he had the reputation of being a sound and thorough scholar, but to his keen interest and constant activity in the management of college affairs both faculty and undergraduate. Before the day of deans, Thacher did much of the work which a dean would perform today. He was known as one of the best disciplinarians that the college ever had and yet he retained the devotion and affection of undergraduates to an extraordinary degree. As an undergraduate he had been ""exuberant in spirit,"" and one who was a student under him in Yale writes of ""Tutor Thacher, the florid and fiery, of perpetual youth and enthusiasm.""
He and Professor Theodore Dwight Woolsey [q.v.] were the first advocates at Yale of graduate instruction in non-technical fields and he himself was one of the first classicists to go abroad for the advancement of his scholarship. This scholarship was never very productive. He edited Cicero's De Officiis in 1850, and largely as a result of his work with Karl Zumpt in Berlin he published in 1871 "A Latin Grammar for the Use of Schools", a translation of the work of Johan Nikolai Madvig. Aside from these productions, a few slight essays and book reviews in the New Englander make up his professional output. A teacher always, rather than an investigator, he seems even to have had a slightly suspicious attitude toward those who gave too much time to research.
Even in his teaching he was possibly too much of a disciplinarian and was sometimes thought to stick too rigorously to the grammar. To his work as administrator, Thacher brought exceptional qualifications and in this line lay his great achievements. As a teacher he contributed his share to the department's prestige while, with his strong convictions and fearless courage, his energy in raising and administering funds, his interest in people, his wide acquaintance with Yale alumni, and his devout and conscientious character, he played a larger role in the building of modern Yale than that of any one of his contemporaries. -- Clarence W. Mendell
Family.
On Sept. 16, 1846, he married Olivia Day, better known as Livy, the daughter of President Jeremiah Day [q.v.] of Yale. She died on May 18, 1858, leaving five sons, and on Aug. 1, 1860, he married her cousin Elizabeth Baldwin Sherman, who with three sons and one daughter survived him. Both wives were granddaughters of founding father Roger Sherman.
His son Thomas Thacher was a prominent lawyer. His sons Sherman Day Thacher and William Larned Thacher were the founder of the Thacher School in Ojai, California; and his daughter Elizabeth Sherman Thacher married William Kent (U.S. Congressman). He was also the paternal grandfather of US Solicitor General Thomas D. Thacher and Molly Kazan, and the great-great-grandfather of actress and writer Zoe Kazan.

Public rights

In America, public rights, as compared to private rights, belong to citizens but are vested in and vindicated by political entities. Public rights cannot be vindicated by private citizens. A right must normally be a private right to be vindicated in court.
An exception to this general proposition is found in "Flast v. Cohen". 392 U.S. 83 (1968). In "Flast" the American Supreme Court held that a private citizen could challenge the constitutionality of a federal tax if the citizen established "a logical link between status [as a taxpayer and the type of legislative enactment attacked . . . a nexus between that status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged."

<doc id="9657166" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9657166" title="Trillium sessile">
Trillium sessile

Trillium sessile (Toadshade or Sessile-flowered wake-robin) is a perennial spring wildflower native to the central part of the eastern United States and the Ozarks. It is a small trillium (rarely over 9 cm tall). Toadshade can be distinguished from other trilliums by its single foul smelling, stalkless, flower nestled in the middle of its three leaves. The three maroon petals, maintain a "closed" posture throughout its presence, the petals are occasionally pale green. The leaves are sometimes, but not always mottled with shades of light and dark green. Its species name comes from the Latin word "sessilis" which means low sitting, and refers to its stalkless flower.
Ecology.
"T. sessile" is most common in rich moist woods but also can be found in rich forests, limestone woods, flood plains, along fence rows. It is persistent under light pasturing. The foul smelling flowers attract its primary pollinators, flies and beetles. The flowers are present from April-June. This plant is clump forming from a thick rhizome. The above ground parts of the plant die back by mid-summer, but may persist longer in areas that do not completely dry out.
Toadshade is listed as state threatened in Michigan and state endangered in New York; both states are on the northern edge of its range.
Classification.
Uncommon, green flowered forms of this plant are sometimes classified as "Trillium sessile" forma "viridiflorum" (Beyer). The term "Trillium sessile var. luteum" used by some nurseries may cause confusion, since this is an older synonym for "Trillium luteum", not of "T. sessile". 
Uses.
Though some accounts indicate that the cooked greens of this plant may be edible as an emergency food, however the entire plant, and especially the root is known to induce vomiting. The fruits are considered a suspected poison. This plant has been used medicinally to treat tumors. "T. sessile" is sometimes cited as having been used as a poultice for boils and as a panacea-like decoction, but this is doubtful as it is attributed to Native American tribes (the Yuki and Wailaki) of California, where this plant is not known to occur.
This plant is sometimes used in woodland wildflower gardens. Like many trilliums, "T. sessile" often does not transplant successfully from the wild.

Event to knowledge

Event to knowledge (E2K) is an accounting metric that measures the time from when an event occurs to when the responsible person knows about it. The shorter the average E2K time, the more timely an organization’s financial information will be.
Importance of E2K.
Timeliness is one of the most important characteristics of financial information. The more timely information is, the more relevant it is to the reader. E2K helps organizations focus and improve their internal accounting processes.
E2K measures a number of events. Firstly, it considers the time for a sub-ledger or supporting system to record an event. If a sub-ledger performs no reporting on its own and it posts to the general ledger on a batch basis (nightly, weekly, monthly, etc.); then this will elongate the E2K time. 
The faster the general ledger can report the impact of an event, the smaller the E2K value. Waiting for all accounting journals to be posted, balancing, reconciliation and producing paper reports adds to the E2K time. 
There are two key E2K measures, the maximum and average E2K values. The maximum value is the time from when the first transaction is entered in a system during a new fiscal period to when it is reported. An average E2K time may be for an entire system or a sub-component. For example, E2K can be reported by each sub-ledger (accounts payable, payroll, manufacturing, etc.) or for the entire system.
Best E2K practice.
Organizations can reduce their E2K time through a number of strategies: 
1. Implementing and upgrading systems to take advantage of faster close cycles 
2. Use of workflow technologies to communicate exceptions and critical events to those responsible
3. Reporting Marts and the like away from the OLTP system for internal reporting
4. Adjust accounting cycles to natural business cycles. 
5. Benchmark and set targets to improve current practice.

Léon Bertrand

Léon Bertrand (born May 11, 1951) is a French politician. Previously a professor of physics and biology, he is Mayor of Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni since 1983. He was elected to the French National Assembly for the Rally for the Republic representing French Guiana's 2nd constituency in 1988 and was reelected at every election till 2007.
Biography.
He described himself in an article published in the French daily Libération when he was a minister, in 2005: ""Born on the banks of the Maroni River, in Guyana, a French département in Amazonia situated 7,000 km afar from Paris, grandson of a convict from Vendée who had married a Black woman after his liberation, son of a Creole father and of an Amerindian Surinamese mother, I am Léon Bertrand, with a name typically French but with an physical appearance typically exotic.""
He joined the UMP in 2002, and, as a known confidant of President Jacques Chirac, he was named Secretary of State for Tourism in 2002 and later Delegate Minister for Tourism in 2004. He held this office until May 15, 2007. When he was a minister, he realized that ""several times, when I received in my office people who didn't know my physical appearance, their republican respectful «Monsieur le ministre» was automatically addressed to my advisor, who was white, and not to me. But what's for me quite exceptional and has very minor consequences as a public person is, on the contrary, the daily lot of all those who belong to what people label «Visible minority»"."
Running for re-election as deputy in the French legislative election, 2007, he was surprisingly defeated with 47.1% of the votes in the runoff against Chantal Berthelot (PSG), who won 52.9%. Nonetheless, he was re-elected Mayor of Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni in 2008 by a large margin. 
He was nominated as the UMP's top candidate in the 2010 regional elections in French Guiana.
During the night of 27–28 November 2009, Léon Bertrand was arrested and put into custody on charges of favoritism and corruption.
Despite still being in custody, he is candidate on the third place of a right wing list not endorsed by the UMP for the March 2010 regional elections in French Guiana.

Yang Jian (楊暕) (585–618), courtesy name Shiku (世胐), nickname Ahai (阿孩), was an imperial prince of the Chinese dynasty Sui Dynasty. During the reign of his father Emperor Yang, he carried the title of Prince of Qi. When his father was killed in a coup led by the general Yuwen Huaji in 618, Yang Jian and his sons were also killed.
During Emperor Wen's reign.
Yan Jian was born in 585, during the reign of his grandfather Emperor Wen. He was the second son of Emperor Wen's son Yang Guang the PrincePrincess Xiao]]. Yang Jian was considered handsome in his childhood, and Emperor Wen loved him. In 593, Emperor Wen created him the Prince of Yuzhang. As he grew in age, he studied the Confucian classics and histories. In 599, Emperor Wen made him the head of the legislative bureau ("Neishi Sheng", 內史省), one of the five main bureaus of government.
In 600, due to Yang Guang's machinations, Emperor Wen deposed Yang Jian's uncle Yang Yong the Crown Prince, and created Yang Guang crown prince instead. In 601, Yang Jian was made the commandant at Yang Province (揚州, roughly modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), to replace his father Yang Guang.
During Emperor Yang's reign.
In 604, Emperor Wen died—a death that traditional historians, while admitting a lack of direct evidence, generally believed to be a murder ordered by Yang Guang. Yang Guang took the throne as Emperor Yang. In 606, Emperor Yang created Yang Jian the greater title of Prince of Qi. Soon thereafter, Yang Jian's older brother Yang Zhao the Crown Prince died, and while under traditional Confucian principles of succession, one of Yang Zhao's sons should be created crown prince, but Emperor Yang did not do so, creating Yang Zhao's sons only imperial princes, and it was commonly believed that Yang Jian would become crown prince. As a result, Yang Jian became particularly honored by others, and when Emperor Yang sought people to serve on Yang Jian's staff, young nobles were anxious to be included, and Yang Zhao's guards were transferred to Yang Jian. He was made the mayor of the eastern capital Luoyang as well.
As a result, Yang Jian became arrogant, and he and his staff member often carried out illegal deeds, and he particularly liked to seize commoner women to make them his concubines. In one instance, his aunt Yang Lihua the Princess Leping initially offered a beautiful woman from the Liu (柳) clan to Emperor Yang, but Emperor Yang did not act quickly, and the princess offered Lady Liu to Yang Jian instead. When Emperor Yang subsequently wanted Lady Liu, he found out that Yang Jian already took her, a fact that irritated him. The relationship between father and son further deteriorated when, on a visit to Yulin, they hunted together—as Emperor Yang's guards were able to kill few animals, they blamed Yang Jian's guards for taking all of the animals, which made Emperor Yang further irritated at Yang Jian. Emperor Yang began to investigate Yang Jian's faults.==During Emperor Yang's reign==

Emperor Yang began to investigate Yang Jian's faults.
Soon, one incident gave Emperor Yang the excuse to investigate further—as one of Yang Jian's favorite officials, Huangfu Xu (皇甫詡) the county magistrate of Yijue County (伊闕, a suburb of Luoyang), was taken by Yang Jian to Fenyang Palace (汾陽宮, in modern Linfen, Shanxi) in contravention of regulations that county magistrates were not allowed to leave their counties without good cause. The official Wei Deyu (韋德裕), in order to please Emperor Yang, filed an indictment against Yang Jian. Emperor Yang sent his guards to Yang Jian's palace and searched it, seeking evidence of further wrongdoing, and they found a major scandal. Yang Jian's wife Princess Wei had died sometime ago, and Yang Jian then carried out an affair with her sister who had already married a man from the Yuan clan. Believing in a fortuneteller who told him that Princess Wei's sister would one day be empress and believing Yang Zhao's three sons to be in the way, Yang Jian engaged witches to curse them. In anger, Emperor Yang executed some of Yang Jian's close associates and ordered Princess Wei's sister to commit suicide. Emperor Yang commented, "I only have Yang Jian as a son; otherwise, I would have dragged him to the execution field and had him beheaded, to show the power of laws."
Yang Jian was not removed from his post, but thereafter exerted little influence. Emperor Yang sent a guard commander to watch over Yang Jian, with orders to report any wrongdoing immediately. He also gave Yang Jian a small number of guards, and those who were assigned to Yang Jian were all weak or old. There were few references to Yang Jian in history for the rest of Emperor Yang's reign. One such reference was in spring 610, when a number of people claiming to be incarnations of the Maitreya Buddha entered into Luoyang and seized weapons, intending to attack the palace, but before they could do so, Yang Jian encountered them. Yang Jian seized them and executed all of them.
In 618, with most of Sui territory engulfed in agrarian rebellions, Emperor Yang was at Jiangdu (江都, the capital of Yang Province), and Yang Jian was with him. A coup led by the general Yuwen Huaji killed Emperor Yang. The troops involved in the coup then went to arrest Yang Jian. Yang Jian, believing the troops to be sent by Emperor Yang, pleaded, "Honorable imperial messenger, please do not carry out the edict yet. I will surely not rebel against the state." The troops did not respond, and they dragged Yang Jian and his two sons out to the streets and beheaded them.
One of Yang Jian's concubines was pregnant at the time of his death. Later, she accompanied Yang Jian's mother Empress Xiao to Tujue to join Princess Yicheng, a Sui princess who had married Tujue's Shibi Khan Ashina Duojishi. Yang Jian's concubine had earlier given birth to a posthumous son, Yang Zhengdao (楊政道), and Yang Zhengdao was created the Prince of Sui by Ashina Duojishi's brother and successor the Chuluo Khan Ashina Qilifu. Yang Zhengdao later returned to China during the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang and was created a duke.

New South Wales 42 class locomotive

The 42 class were a class of diesel locomotives built by Clyde Engineering, Granville for the New South Wales Government Railways in 1955/56.
History.
The design was based on the Electro-Motive Diesel EMD F7 locomotive and were very similar to the GM 12 class then being built by Clyde Engineering for the Commonwealth Railways.
They initially worked express passenger services including the Brisbane Limited, Intercapital Daylight and Melbourne Limited and later the Southern Aurora and Spirit of Progress. As newer locomotives arrived they were concentrated on the Main South line operating freight services.
By April 1978 the Australian Federated Union of Enginemen placed a ban on the 42 class operating as lead engines due to cab conditions. In 1980 4201 had its cab upgraded during overhaul to overcome these issues, but with their replacement imminent it was decided not to treat the rest of the class. All were withdrawn in 1983.

Environmental Crime Prevention Program

The Environmental Crime Prevention Program (ECPP) was an organization which tracked dumped nuclear waste, including Soviet nuclear missiles left over from the Cold War. It was founded by Italian lawyer and self-styled security consultant Mario Scaramella along with his partner Filippo Marino in Naples, Italy in 1997. Describing itself as an "permanent intergovernmental conference" focusing on environmental crime with rotating presidencies by such countries as Samoa and Angola, its true purpose remains difficult to discern, and recently the ECPP has attracted the attention of Italian investigative authorities, who consider it to be a probable front organization.
Mission and purpose.
The website of Environmental Security International quotes Scaramella as describing the mission of the ECPP as "providing environmental protection and security through technology on a global basis, particularly for developing nations. ECPP has offices at the Fucino Space Center in Italy, the largest civilian space center in the world. ECPP has used aerial surveillance and the remote sensing capabilities of satellites to detect environmental crimes in Eastern and Southern Europe and eco-terrorism in Central Africa and South America."
Stealth conferences.
Among the mysteries of the ECPP was a supposed "IV Plenary Conference" held at the United States Environmental Protection Agency's offices in New York, which Scaramella used to register for intergovernmental status.
The ECPP's IV Plenary Conference reportedly lasted for all of one hour. The ECPP didn't even hold a First Plenary Conference, as Scaramella thought it more credible to directly pass to the Second Conference in order to succeed in fund-raising. The "IV Plenary Conference" was then used by Scaramella to give credit to his shell organisation when he went to see other official organisations.

Great barracuda

The great barracuda ("Sphyraena barracuda") also known as the giant barracuda, is a species of barracuda. Great barracudas often grow over long and are a type of ray-finned fish.
Appearance.
Great barracudas are large fish. Mature specimens are usually around in length and weigh . Exceptionally large specimens can exceed and weigh over . The record-sized specimen caught on rod-and-reel weighed and measured , while an even bigger specimen measured and weighed . Barracudas are elongated fish with powerful jaws. The lower jaw of the large mouth juts out beyond the upper. Barracudas possess strong, fang-like teeth that are unequal in size and set in sockets in the jaws and on the roof of the mouth. The head is quite large and is pointed and pike-like in appearance. The gill covers do not have spines and are covered with small scales. The two dorsal fins are widely separated, with the first having five spines and the second having one spine and 9 soft rays. The second dorsal fin equals the anal fin in size and is situated more or less above it. The lateral line is prominent and extends straight from head to tail. The spinous dorsal fin is situated above the pelvis. The hind end of the caudal fin is forked or concave, and it is set at the end of a stout peduncle. The pectoral fins are placed low down on the sides. The barracuda has a large swim bladder.
In general, the barracuda's coloration is dark green or a blue type coloration or grey above chalky-white below. Sometimes, a row of darker cross-bars or black spots occurs on each side. The fins may be yellowish or dark.
Behavior.
Barracudas appear in open seas. They are voracious predators and hunt using a classic example of lie-in-wait or ambush. They rely on surprise and short bursts of speed (up to 27 mph (43 km/h) to overrun their prey, sacrificing maneuverability. Barracudas are more or less solitary in their habits. Young and half-grown fish frequently congregate in shoals. 
Their diets are composed almost totally of fish of all kinds. Large barracudas, when gorged, may attempt to herd a school of prey fish in shallow water, where they guard over them until they are ready for another hunt.
Barracudas and humans.
Like sharks, some species of barracuda are reputed to be dangerous to swimmers. They are scavengers, and may mistake snorkellers for large predators, following them in hopes of eating the remains of their prey. Swimmers have been reported being bitten by barracuda, but such incidents are rare and possibly caused by poor visibility. Barracuda generally avoid muddy shallows, so attacks in surf are more likely to be by small sharks. Barracudas may mistake things that glint and shine for prey. An incident of a barracuda jumping out of water and injuring a kayaker has been reported, but a marine biologist at the University of Florida said the type of wound appeared to have rather been caused by a houndfish.
Handfeeding or touching large barracuda in general is to be avoided. Spearfishing around barracudas can also be dangerous, as they are quite capable of ripping a chunk from a wounded fish thrashing on a spear.
Diamond rings and other shiny objects have been known to catch their attention and resemble prey to them. Caution should be taken when swimming near mangrove coastlines by covering or removing such items.
However, barracuda have dreadful sets of teeth, and while they display the disconcerting habit of curiously following divers and swimmers, raids on humans are rare. Oftentimes, an attack consists of a single strike when the fish attempts to steal prey from a spear or mistakes a shiny object for a fish. While serious, attacks are almost never lethal, but can result in lacerations and the loss of some tissue.

Charles Chewings

Charles Chewings (16 April 1859 – 9 June 1937) was an Australian geologist and anthropologist. 
__NOTOC__
Early life.
Charles Chewings was born at Woorkongoree station, near Burra, South Australia, the third son of John Chewings, pastoralist, and his wife Sarah, "née" Wall. He was educated by a tutor and at Prince Alfred College, Adelaide. After engaging in sheep farming, Chewings travelled to the Finke River in central Australia in 1881 with two camels, and found them so useful that he imported more of them and started a carrying business. He gave some account of his explorations in his "The Sources of the Finke River" (1886). Chewings married Miss F. M. Braddock in 1887 and they had two sons and two daughters. 
Career.
Chewings went to Europe in 1888, studied geology at University College, London and University of Heidelberg, obtaining the degree of Ph.D. After returning to Australia, Chewings worked in Western Australia for some years reporting on mines, before going back to South Australia to resume camel carrying. He was much interested in the aborigines and made a careful study of them. 
Chewings was very interested by the discovery of marine fossils on Tempe Downs station by his manager F. Thornton, and in 1891 published 'Geological notes on the Upper Finke Basin' in the "Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia". He listed the fossils and began a tentative interpretation of the region's succession of rock strata. Chewings became a mining consultant in Coolgardie, Western Australia in 1894, and later worked in Central Australia for almost 20 years.
Late life.
After World War I, Chewings retired to Adelaide and contributed several more scientific papers relating to central Australia to the "Transactions". He worked for some time on a dictionary of the Aranda language, and towards the end of 1936 published a good popular book on the aborigines entitled "Back in the Stone Age". He died on 9 June 1937 and was buried in West Terrace Cemetery. Chewings was a fellow of the Geological Society of London and of the Berlin Geological Society.

Nicholas Chevalier

Nicholas Chevalier (9 May 1828 – 15 March 1902) was an Australian artist.
__NOTOC__
Early life.
Chevalier was born in St Petersburg, Russia, the son of Louis Chevalier, who came from Vaud, Switzerland, and was overseer to the estates of the Prince de Wittgenstein in Russia. Nicholas' mother was Russian. Nicholas left Russia with his father in 1845, and studied painting and architecture in Lausanne, Switzerland and at Munich. The materials used in this painting are oil paints on canvas.
Career.
In 1851 Chevalier moved to London and worked as an illustrator in lithography and water-colour. He also designed a fountain which was erected in the royal grounds at Osborne, and two of his paintings were hung at the Academy in 1852. Further study in painting followed at Rome. About the end of 1854 Chevalier sailed from London to Australia to join his father and brother, and in August 1855 obtained work as a cartoonist on the newly established Melbourne "Punch". Later he did illustrative work for the "Illustrated Australian News" and also worked in chromo-lithography. In 1864, when the National Gallery of Victoria was founded, an exhibition of works by Victorian artists was held. The government agreed to buy the best picture exhibited for £200. Chevalier's oil painting "The Buffalo Ranges" was selected, and was the first picture painted in Australia to be included in the Melbourne collection. In 1865 Chevalier visited New Zealand, travelling widely and doing much work there which was exhibited at Melbourne on his return. In 1869 he joined the H.M.S. "Galatea" as an artist with the Duke of Edinburgh, on the voyage to the East and back to London with stops in Tahiti, Hawaii, Japan, China, Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and India. The pictures painted during the voyage were exhibited at South Kensington. 
In January 1874 Chevalier was commissioned by Queen Victoria to travel to St Petersburg and paint a picture of the marriage of the Duke of Edinburgh. Chevalier made London his headquarters and was a constant exhibitor at the Academy from 1871 to 1887. He had one picture in the 1895 Academy but had practically given up painting by then. Chevalier died in London on 15 March 1902. 
Legacy.
Chevalier married Caroline Wilkie in 1855, a relative of Sir David Wilkie, who survived him. Chevalier was a man of much personal charm and spoke fluent French, English, Russian, German, Italian and Portuguese. He was a good amateur musician being second violinist in the Royal Amateur Orchestral Society which had been started by officers in the "Galatea" and in which the duke was first violin.
The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, the Dunedin Public Art Gallery (New Zealand), the Honolulu Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery, Art Gallery of New South Wales and the National Library of Australia (Canberra) are among the public collections holding works by Nicholas Chevalier.
In 2011 Nicholas Chevalier was the subject of a major survey exhibition and publication, 'Australian Odyssey', staged at the Gippsland Art Gallery, and the Geelong Gallery, Victoria.

Mary Frances of the Five Wounds

Mary Frances of the Five Wounds, T.O.S.F. (), was an Italian member of the Third Order of St. Francis, who is honored as a saint in the Catholic Church.
Life.
She was born Anna Maria Gallo, the daughter of Francesco Gallo and Barbara Basinsin, in the Quartieri Spagnoli (Spanish Quarter) of Naples, a red-light district of the city, still known for its high crime. According to tradition, another saint, the Jesuit, Francis de Geronimo, predicted her future sanctity while she was still an infant. Her family was of the middle class, but her father, a weaver of gold lace, was a very violent man, who regularly abused his family physically, often severely.
When Gallo was sixteen, her father attempted to force her into a marriage with a young man of means who was seeking her hand. She refused and asked to join the Franciscan Third Order, through which she could live out a religious life in the family home. The friars of Naples were part of the reform of St. Peter of Alcantara, and they and the tertiares under their rule were known for the strictness of their lives. Through the intervention of a friar, Father Theophilus, permission to enter the Order was eventually granted by her father.
Gallo was received into the Order on 8 September 1731 and began wearing the religious habit of the Order, which was an uncommon practice by that era. She also adopted the use of the religious name she took upon being received into the Order, out of her devotion to the Blessed Mother, St. Francis of Assisi and the Passion of Christ. She continued to live in the family home to serve God as a consecrated virgin, as was customary in those days.
She took as her spiritual director, the Franciscan friar, John Joseph of the Cross, while her confessor was the Barnabite priest, Francis Xavier Bianchi, and she began to be known among her neighbors for her work of charity, helping the poor of the sector. She was a person of deep prayer, often spending long hours in meditation.
In 1753 she joined with another Franciscan tertiary, known only as Maria Felice, and they moved into a small palace owned by a priest, Giovanni Pessiri, who became their spiritual director. The two women occupied the second floor, sleeping on the floor, and the priest the floor above. She is said to have received the wounds of the stigmata while living there and suffered patiently many physical afflictions and spiritual trials. She would wear gloves to cover the marks on her hands, while she did her work.
Veneration.
Mary Frances was buried in the Franciscan Church of Santa Lucia al Monte in Naples, which she attended during her life. This church also contains the tomb of John Joseph, now also declared a saint. 
Mary Frances was declared Venerable by Pope Pius VII, on 18 May 1803. She was beatified by Pope Gregory XVI on 12 November 1843. She was soon canonized by Pope Pius IX on 29 June 1867. Her feast day is celebrated on 6 October. She was the first woman from Naples to have been declared a saint by the Catholic Church.
Devotion to Mary Frances has long continued to be strong in the neighborhood where she lived, and of which she is the patron saint. The residents credit her intercession with the little damage the sector endured during World War II, when over 100 bombs were dropped on it. Her home has been preserved as a chapel and museum.
Pope Pius IX, who canonized Mary Frances, declared her to be a patroness of expectant mothers and of women having difficulty conceiving. She is also the patroness of the Gallo World Family Foundation, which was founded to promote the development of Judeo-Christian values in the betterment of the world by members of the Gallo family scattered worldwide.
On 6 October 2001, her remains were transferred from the Church of Santa Lucia to the house where she had spent the last half of her life. It is now the Shrine of St. Mary Frances of the Five Wounds. It is still a common practice for expectant mothers to go there to be blessed with her relic. Many votive offerings from mothers who credit her with their successful deliveries are displayed in the sanctuary.

Ted Fest

The Friends of Ted Festival, or Ted Fest, is an annual fan convention held on the island of Inishmore, off the coast of County Galway, Ireland for fans of the Channel 4 sitcom "Father Ted". The series was set on the fictional Craggy Island off Ireland's west coast, so Ted Fest is also held on such an island. In 2010 the festival expanded to an Australian edition, which was held in Parkes, New South Wales.
Festivals by year.
2007.
Events.
A number of events took place at the festival, each themed in association with the comedy series.
A Song for Europe.
This is a parody of the episode "Song for Europe".
The 2007 Inis Mór Song for Europe is ""Jack in the Box"" by OK Chorale.
Songwriters Peadar and Geordan joined the festival on Inis Mor on Sunday 25 February to record the song live accompanied by the Craggy Island Singers. According to the official website, the OK Chorale was formed following "a bizarre boating accident", in which "a skiff containing two Christy Moore impersonators, fleeing from an ugly scene at the Tory Island singing festival, became hopelessly lost and collided with a fishing boat entering Teelin Harbour. The ensuing brawl developed into a lengthy drinking session in the nearby Rusty Mackerel, where the men discovered their mutual enthusiasm for (a) The Eurovision Song Contest and (b) the music and legs of Clodagh Rodgers."
Toilet Duck Comedy Awards.
This is a parody of the Golden Cleric award featured in "A Christmassy Ted".
On Wednesday 21 February at the Kings Head in County Galway eight of Ireland’s up and coming comedians competed for a place in the final at Ted Fest 2007 on Inis Mór.
The final took place in the Aran Islands Hotel on the Friday of the festival, attended by special guest Michael Redmond (the actor who played Father Stone from the series).
The prize for the Kings Head Toilet Duck Award is €1000, an appearance at the Cork Comedy Festival and a golden duck.
The 2007 winner was Sharon Mannion and the 2008 winner was Bob Hennigan. The winner in 2010 was Gerry McBride.
Football match.
This is a parody of the "All-Priests Five-a-Side Over-75's Indoor Football Challenge Match" featured in the episode "Escape from Victory".
A football match between the two islands to commemorate the game that featured in the series. Former Republic of Ireland footballers Tony Cascarino and John Aldridge were opposing captains, whilst celebrity referee Pierluigi Collina sailed to Inis Mór to referee the one-off tie. The match took place on the beach on the final day of the festival. The winning island side, (Inis Mór by 2-0) was declared "The Real Craggy Island" for the coming year. Inis Oirr received the title of "Rugged Island". The captains on the day were Padraig Ó Flaithearta (Inis Mor) and Mairtin Seoighe (Inis Oirr), and the goalscorers were Adam Clark and Cillian Joyce.
2008.
Ted Fest 2008 featured separate events on the island of Inishmore and on the mainland at Kilfenora, County Clare [http://www.friendsofted.org/whatson.php?id=7 (site of Parochial House external shots in the series). The Craggy Island World Cup was expanded to admit all islands of Ireland. [http://www.friendsofted.org/craggyworldcup.php]
2009.
The third Ted Fest was spread over two weekends. The Pink Flamingos took the third Craggy Cup (non-island teams being permitted for the first time), while, in a bizarre coincidence, the Toilet Duck Comedy Award was won by a genuine ex-priest named FJ Murray.
2010.
Tickets for the fourth Ted Fest went on sale in September 2009. The first weekend took place on Inishmore and the second on Inisheer. A parallel Ted Fest Oz took place in Parkes, New South Wales, Australia during the Easter Triduum, however it was not a success, the local police removing its liquor license due to noise levels.
2011.
The fifth Ted Fest took place on Inishmore from 24 to 27 February 2011. Scheduled events include a Lovely Girls pageant, "Ted's Got Talent" (a parody of "Britain's Got Talent"), the Ronnie Drew Hour,
a Virtual Confession Box, a Craggy Island "Kill Bill" Festival, the Father Ted Prizeless Quiz, the Craggy Cup, "Matchmaking with Nellie," a Pirate Cruise and a walking tour to the Amish community.
Ted Fest V also featured a video blog by one of Dermot Morgan's sons, Rob Morgan, which gave an Access All Areas look at some of the many events at Ted Fest.

Dębczyn culture

The Dębczyn group (in German also "Denziner") is an archeological culture in Pomerania from the 3rd to 6th centuries. It was derived from the neighboring Wielbark culture with influences from the Elbe region, and succeeded by migration of West Slavs, the Pomeranian tribes.
In the second half of the third century, the Dębczyn (Denzin) culture (or group) succeeded the Wielbark culture between the Persante and Drage rivers, and a local, not yet classified culture between the lower Oder and Persante rivers. The adjacent areas to the east were uninhabited by this time. Whether the eastern Dębczyn culture replaced or evolved from the Wielbark culture is not yet known, in the western areas, settlement was continuous. The emergence of this group is characterized by an influence of the Vistula region (Wielbark culture), the expansion of the Gustow group, and many paralleles to the Elbe Germanic areas. The dead were buried unburned. The culture existed until the first quarter of the 6th century, when burial of the dead in grave fields stopped.
The Dębczyn group might comprise the archaeological remnants of Tacitus' Lemovii, probably identical with Widsith's Glommas, who are believed to have been the neighbors of the Rugians, a tribe dwelling at the Baltic Sea coast before the migration period in an area which centuries later became Pomerania. Germanic sagas report a battle on the isle of Hiddensee between king Hetel (Hethin, Heodin of the Glommas) and Rugian king Hagen, following the abdication of Hagen's daughter Hilde by Hetel. Yet, there are also other hypotheses about the location of the Lemovii, and that their identification as Glommas, though probable, is not certain.

The Punch

The Punch is a Nigerian daily newspaper. It is the most widely read newspaper in Nigeria.
History.
"The Punch" newspaper was founded by two friends, James Aboderin, an accountant and Sam Amuka, a columnist and editor at the "Daily Times". Sam Amuka became the first editor of the "Sunday Punch". In November 1976, a few years after the first print of its Sunday edition, the duo started printing their trademark daily newspaper. Both editions were designed to favor a friendlier apolitical approach to news reporting, combining footages of social events with everyday political news. The paper sustains itself by delving into broad issues that interest a myriad of people.
However, during the twilight of the Second Republic, political exigencies had introduced conflicts to its original intentions, Aboderin and Amuka parted ways due partly to political conflicts. Aboderin later secured the support of his former foe, MKO Abiola, after the latter left the NPN. The paper began to take on a political stance, mostly against the Shagari regime. Supposedly, days before the end of the administration of Shagari, a few "Punch" editors were aware of a coup approaching and injected strong anti-government tones in their reporting.
Press freedom.
"The Punch" was not immune to the excess of authoritarian regimes in the country. In 1990, its editor was jailed for 54 days. In 1993, and 1994, the publishing house was closed on the direction of the nation's ruler.

<doc id="9658050" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9658050" title="Opisthorchiasis">
Opisthorchiasis

Opisthorchiasis is a parasitic disease caused by species in the genus Opisthorchis (specifically, "Opisthorchis viverrini" and "Opisthorchis felineus").
Medical care and loss of wages caused by "Opisthorchis viverrini" in Laos and in Thailand costs about $120 million annually or $120 million per year can cost Northeast Thailand only.
Infection of "Opisthorchis viverrini" and of other liver flukes in Asia affect the poor and poorest people. Opisthorchiasis have received less attention in comparison of other diseases and it is a neglected disease in Asia.
Prevalence.
[[File:Incidence of CCA and O. viverrini in Thailand from 1990–2001.jpg|thumb|Prevalence of "Opisthorchis viverrini" in Thailand in 1990–2001 correlates with a higher cholangiocarcinoma:
19.3% in North Thailand,
15.7% in North East Thailand,
3.8% in Central Thailand,
0% in Southern Thailand.]]
Opisthorchiasis is prevalent in geographical regions where raw cyprinid fishes are a staple of the diet of humans. The prevalence of human infection can be as high as 70% in some regions, for example in Khon Kaen Province in Thailand. The parasite establishes in the bile ducts of the liver as well as extrahepatic ducts and the gall bladder of the mammalian (definitive) host.
Children under the age of 5 are rarely infected by "Opisthorchis viverrini".
In the Lao People's Democratic Republic, the prevalence of opisthorchiasis was:
In Thailand, the prevalence of opisthorchiasis was:
"Opisthorchis viverrini" was thought to be the only species of liver fluke in Thailand, but PCR techniques have revealed also "Clonorchis sinensis" in (central) Thailand in 2008.
Another reference from 2002 lists worldwide number of cases about 9 million (without year of estimation). In Thailand, about 7.3 million. About 50 million people are at risk of infection.
In 2005, 67.3 million of people worldwide are at risk of infection.
Keiser & Utzinger (2005) have speculated that aquaculture development is the key risk factor for foodborne trematodiases including opisthorchiasis caused by "Opisthorchis viverrini".
Symptoms.
Symptoms of opisthorchiasis (caused by "Opisthorchis" spp.) are indistinguishable from clonorchiasis (caused by "Clonorchis sinensis"), so the disease should be referred as clonorchiasis.
About 80% of infected people have no symptoms, though they can have eosinophilia. This is when the infection is weak and there are less than 1000 eggs in one gram in feces.
When there are 10.000-30.000 eggs in one gram of feces, then the infection is heavy. Symptoms of heavier infections with "Opisthorchis viverrini" may include: diarrhoea, pain in epigastric and pain in the upper right quadrant, lack of appetite (anorexia), fatigue, yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice) and mild fever.
These parasites are long-lived and cause heavy chronic infections may led to accumulation of fluid in legs (edema) and in the peritoneal cavity (ascites), enlarged non-functional gall-bladder and also cholangitis, which can lead to periductal fibrosis, cholecystitis and cholelithiasis, obstructive jaundice, hepatomegaly and/or fibrosis of the periportal system.
Importantly, both experimental and epidemiological evidence strongly implicates "Opisthorchis viverrini" infections in the etiology of a malignant cancer of the bile ducts (cholangiocarcinoma) in humans which has a very poor prognosis. Indeed, "Clonorchis sinensis" and "Opisthorchis viverrini" are both categorized by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as Group 1 carcinogens.
In humans, the onset of cholangiocarcinoma occurs with chronic opisthorchiasis, associated with hepatobiliary damage, inflammation, periductal fibrosis and/or cellular responses to antigens from the infecting fluke. These conditions predispose to cholangiocarcinoma, possibly through an enhanced susceptibility of DNA to damage by carcinogens. Chronic hepatobiliary damage is reported to be multi-factorial and considered to arise from a continued mechanical irritation of the epithelium by the flukes present, particularly via their suckers, metabolites and excreted/secreted antigens as well as immunopathological processes. In regions where "Opisthorchis viverrini" is highly endemic, the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma is unprecedented. For instance, cholangiocarcinomas represent 15% of primary liver cancer worldwide, but in Thailand's Khon Kaen region, this figure escalates to 90%, the highest recorded incidence of this cancer in the world. Of all cancers worldwide from 2002, 0.02% were cholangiocarcinoma caused by "Opisthorchis viverrini".
The cancer of the bile ducts caused by opisthorchiasis occur in the ages 25–44 years in Thailand.
Diagnosis.
For medical diagnosis there is need to find eggs of "Opisthorchis viverrini" in feces using Kato technique.
An antigen 89 kDa of "Opisthorchis viverrini" can be detected by ELISA test.
A PCR test capable of amplifying a segment of the internal transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA for the opisthorchiid and heterophyid flukes eggs taken directly from faeces was developed and evaluated in a rural community in central Thailand. The lowest quantity of DNA that could be amplified from individual adults of "Opisthorchis viverrini" was estimated to 0.6 pg.
Prevention.
Currently, there is no effective chemotherapy to combat cholangiocarcinoma, such that intervention strategies need to rely on the prevention or treatment of liver fluke infection/disease. Although effective prevention could be readily achieved by persuading people to consume cooked fish (via education programs), the ancient cultural custom to consume raw, undercooked or freshly pickled fish persists in endemic areas. Cooking or deep-freezing (-20 °C for 7 days) of food made of fish is sure method of prevention. Methods for prevention of "Opisthorchis viverrini" in aquaculture fish ponds were proposed by Khamboonruang et al. (1997).
Treatment.
There was unsuccessful use of chloroquine for opisthorchiasis treatment in 1951-1968.
Thus, currently, the control of opisthorchiasis relies predominantly on anthelmintic treatment with praziquantel. The single dose of praziquantel of 40 mg/kg is effective against opisthorchiasis and also against schistosomiasis. A randomised-controlled trial published in 2011 showed that the broad-spectrum anti-helminthic, tribendimidine, appears to be at least as efficacious as praziquantel.
Artemisinin was also found to have anthelmintic activity against "Opisthorchis viverrini".
Despite the efficacy of this compound, the lack of an acquired immunity to infection predisposes humans to reinfections in endemic regions. In addition, under experimental conditions, the short-term treatment of "Opisthorchis viverrini"-infected hamsters with praziquantel (400 mg per kg of live weight) has been shown to induce a dispersion of parasite antigens, resulting in adverse immunopathological changes as a result of oxidative and nitrative stresses following re-infection with "Opisthorchis viverrini", a process which has been proposed to initiate and/or promote the development of cholangiocarcinoma in humans.
Given the current reliance on a single trematocidal drug against "Opisthorchis viverrini", there is substantial merit in searching for new intervention methods, built on a detailed understanding of the interplay between the parasites and their hosts as well as the biology of the parasites themselves at the molecular level. Furthermore, the characterization of the genes expressed in these parasites should assist in elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which opisthorchiasis initiate and enhance the development of cholangiocarcinoma.

Pitch contour

In linguistics, speech synthesis, and music, the pitch contour of a sound is a function or curve that tracks the perceived pitch of the sound over time.
Pitch contour may include multiple sounds utilizing many pitches, and can relate to frequency function at one point in time to the frequency function at a later point.
It is fundamental to the linguistic concept of tone, where the pitch or change in pitch of a speech unit over time affects the semantic meaning of a sound. It also indicates intonation in pitch accent languages.
One of the primary challenges in speech synthesis technology, particularly for Western languages, is to create a natural-sounding pitch contour for the utterance as a whole. Unnatural pitch contours result in synthesis that sounds "lifeless" or "emotionless" to human listeners, a feature that has become a stereotype of speech synthesis in popular culture.
In music, the pitch contour focuses on the relative change in pitch over time of a primary sequence of played notes. The same contour can be transposed without losing its essential relative qualities, such as sudden changes in pitch or a pitch that rises or falls over time.
Pure tones have a clear pitch, but complex sounds such as speech and music typically have intense peaks at many different frequencies. Nevertheless, by establishing a fixed reference point in the frequency function of a complex sound, and then observing the movement of this reference point as the function translates, one can generate a meaningful pitch contour consistent with human experience.
For example, the vowel "e" has two primary formants, one peaking between 400 and 600 Hz and one between 2200 and 2600 Hz. When a person speaks a sentence involving multiple "e" sounds, the peaks will shift within these ranges, and the movement of the peaks between two instances establishes the difference in their values on the pitch contour.

Henry Samuel Chapman

Henry Samuel Chapman (21 July 1803 – 27 December 1881) was an Australian and New Zealand judge, colonial secretary, attorney-general, journalist and politician.
Early life.
Chapman was born at Kennington, London, the son of Henry Chapman, English civil servant, and his wife Ann, daughter of Rev. Thomas Hart Davies. Chapman was educated privately at Bromley, Kent. 
In 1818, he entered a bank, then in 1823 emigrated to Quebec, Canada where he went into business as a commission merchant. In 1833 he started the first Canadian daily newspapers, the radical "Montreal Daily Advertiser", in association with Samuel Revans.
In 1835, Chapman returned to England as a salaried intermediary between the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada and its friends in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. Chapman remained in England for some time and took up the study of law, being admitted to the bar of the Middle Temple in 1840. Five years earlier he had published "The Act for the Regulation of Municipal Corporations . . . with a complete index and notes". He was also involved in journalism and various Liberal reform movements e.g. the anti-corn law agitations. He served on several Royal Commissions on industry, e.g. on the Yorkshire wool industry, and contributed to reviews and to the seventh edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.
New Zealand and Australia.
Chapman founded the "New Zealand Journal", which he edited and published in London from 1840 to 1843; he also published the "New Zealand Portfolio". He supported the colonising ideas of Edward Gibbon Wakefield, and had a passion for colonial self-government, on which he published several treatises. In 1843 he published the "New Zealand Portfolio, Papers on Subjects of Importance to the Colonists", and was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of New Zealand. He was stationed at Wellington, residing at Karori. The size of the district meant covering such distances as Kawhia to New Plymouth () and New Plymouth to Wellington () on foot. But he was under the Chief Justice William Martin and, according to Charlotte Godley, always "considered himself too good for his present position". So in 1852 he accepted a position in Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania).
Chapman went to Van Diemen's Land as Colonial Secretary in 1852, arriving in April. Later that year, as a nominee member of the council, left the chamber when a vote on the transportation question was being taken. Governor Denison held that as a representative of the government in the legislative council Chapman should have supported its transportation policy and virtually dismissed him, though he gave him leave of absence on half pay until the question could be referred to the Secretary of State. The governor's action was confirmed and Chapman went to Melbourne in 1854 and practised as a barrister. In 1855 he was elected a member of the Victorian Legislative Council for South Bourke, Evelyn and Mornington, and early in 1856 drafted the bill which brought in the ballot system of secret voting, afterwards known as the 'Australian' or 'Victorian' system and adopted by other countries all over the world. The "Australian Encyclopaedia", entry under "ballot", points out that it became law in Victoria on 19 March 1856 and in South Australia on 2 April 1856; though the South Australian proposals had been made first. In Victoria there were very vague ideas about the working of a secret system of voting. Chapman's special contribution was that he devised a method that was workable, and drafted the first bill to become law in any part of the world. Under it the voter struck out the name of any candidate he did not desire to be elected, and this procedure was followed in Victoria until federation came in. Though without a seat in parliament, he had been defeated at an election at St Kilda, Chapman was Attorney-General in the first O'Shanassy ministry for a few weeks in 1857, and securing the St Kilda seat in December, in the following March was asked to form a ministry. This was done with O'Shanassy as premier and Chapman as attorney-general. This government resigned on 27 October 1859. In 1860 Chapman was a lecturer in law at the University of Melbourne. In 1861 he was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Mornington. He resigned his seat in February 1862 to become an acting-judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria, while Redmond Barry took a year's leave of absence.
In March 1864, Chapman was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of New Zealand, at Dunedin. 
He was involved there with the University of Otago and the Otago Institute. 
He retired in 1875, taking up commerce and sheep farming in Central Otago. 
He died of cancer in Dunedin. 
He had an obituary notice in The Times.
Family.
Chapman married twice; firstly to Catherine Brewer, (daughter of T. G. Brewer, a London barrister) in 1840, who was drowned while returning to England along with two sons and a daughter when the ship The London foundered in the Bay of Biscay in January 1866. Chapman revisited England in 1868, and married Miss Selina Frances Carr who survived him, with at least three sons of the first marriage. His fifth son, Sir Frederick Revans Chapman became a Supreme Court judge in New Zealand, and President of the Court of Arbitration.

Le merle noir

Le merle noir ("The Blackbird") is a chamber work by the French composer Olivier Messiaen for flute and piano. It was written and first performed in 1952 and is the composer's shortest independently-published work, lasting just over five minutes.  This work has become a staple of the French flute and piano repertoire.The composition originated in a commission for a test piece for flute for the Paris Conservatoire, at which Messiaen was a professor. The winners of the premier prix in the Concours de flûte that year were Daniel Morlier, Jean Eustache, Jean Ornetti, Régis Calle and the British flute player Alexander Murray. Messiaen had a consuming, lifelong interest in ornithology and particularly bird songs.  While not his first work to incorporate stylised birdsong, "Le merle noir" was the earliest of his pieces to be based mainly on birdsong, and it foreshadows Messiaen's later, more extended birdsong-inspired pieces.

List of collegiate churches in Scotland

There are no functioning Collegiate churches in Scotland today. It is thought that the first "Collegium" of canons with its own chapel was formed in St. Andrews in the 13th century, and it is thought that by the Reformation there were more than 50 secular religious houses. The proscription of the Catholic faith in 1567 meant that these houses had to close.
Although Scotland endured the Iconoclasm of the Reformation, there are still some handsome structures extant. Some Collegiate churches were converted into local parish Kirks, whilst others have fallen to ruin, some a mixture of the two.
As a response to the power of medieval monastiscm, the rulers of Scotland—in common with many other Northern European states—tried to control the power of the church by encouraging local magnates to commission secular houses of worship within their lands and often within their own fortalices.
These churches were often considered as private fiefdoms within certain families as a means to ensure prayers for their souls and for the glory and immortality of their lines. Establishing previous monastic establishments as "Collegia" of Canons helped to "temporalise" authority over large areas of valuable land and increase the power of the crown.

Charles Haddon Chambers

Charles Haddon Spurgeon Chambers (22 April 1860 – 28 March 1921) was an Australian-born dramatist, active in England.
__NOTOC__
Early life.
Chambers was born in Petersham, Sydney, the son of John Ritchie Chambers, who had a good position in the New South Wales civil service, came from Ulster, his mother, Frances, daughter of William Kellett, from Waterford. Charles was educated at the Petersham, Marrickville, and Fort Street High schools, but found routine study tedious and showed no special promise. He entered the lands department at 15 but did not stay long. After two years in the outback working as a boundary rider, in 1880 he was invited by cousins to return with them to Ulster, from there he visited England. On Chambers' return he was in the managerial department of the Montague-Turner opera company.
Career.
In 1882 Chambers moved to England, he had no friends there and had to try various occupations in order to make a living. Chambers wrote letters from London for The Bulletin. In 1884 his first story was accepted, and other work appeared in popular magazines of the time like "Society" and "Truth". In 1886 a one-act play, "One of Them", was acted in London and another curtain-raiser, "The Open Gate", was played at the Comedy Theatre in 1887. His first real success was "Captain Swift", which was produced by Beerbohm Tree at the Haymarket Theatre in the autumn of 1888. This had a good run and was played all over England, in America, and in Australia. He had another success with "The Idler" (1890). His next three plays "The Honourable Herbert, The Old Lady", and "The Pipes of Peace" did not achieve success, but "John-O-Dreams", first played in 1894, was successful. Also in 1894, he had some success with "The Fatal Card". In 1899 possibly his best play, "The Tyranny of Tears", was produced by Charles Wyndham and was frequently revived. Among his later plays "Passers By" (1911) and "The Saving Grace" (1917) are possibly the best.
The famous London-based Australian operatic soprano, Dame Nellie Melba, was his mistress for a number of years. The relationship ended in 1904 for reasons which remain unclear.
Late life.
Chambers retained his interest in Australia and spoke of returning there but never did so. He died at London of cerebro-vascular disease on 28 March 1921. He was twice married, and was survived by his second wife, originally Nelly Louise Burton but known professionally as 'Pepita Bobadilla', and a daughter of the first marriage to Mary, "née" Dewer.

Geffen Playhouse

The Geffen Playhouse (or the Geffen) is a not for profit performing arts theater owned and operated by University of California Los Angeles. It is located in the Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.
Architecture.
The Geffen Playhouse was built in 1929 as the "Masonic Affiliates Club", or the MAC, for students and alumni at UCLA. One of the first 12 structures built in Westwood Village, it was designed by architect Stiles O. Clements.
History.
Originally named the "Westwood Playhouse", UCLA purchased the property in 1993. UCLA's then chancellor, Charles E. Young, appointed Gil Cates (founder and former president of the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television) Producing Director. The theater was renamed in 1995 after media mogul David Geffen donated $5 million, one of the largest philanthropic donations ever made to an already constructed theater.
In 2002, The David Geffen Foundation made a $5-million lead gift towards an eventually $17-million capital campaign to renovate the theater. The renovation was completed and the Geffen reopened on November 16, 2005; the historic character of the theater was maintained, but the interior was gutted. The renovation resulted in the main 500 seat theater being retained, as well as the new 125-seat Audrey Skirball-Kenis Theater being added.
The Geffen offers 5 plays per season on the main stage and 3-4 plays on the second stage (the Skirball-Kenis). The theater is known for having well known film and television actors in their productions. Some of the actors and actresses who have appeared in recent productions at the theater include: 
Jason Alexander, Debbie Allen, Annette Bening, Dana Delany, Roma Downey, Peter Falk, Neil Patrick Harris, David Hyde-Pierce, Carrie Fisher, Rebecca Pidgeon, Martin Short, Alicia Silverstone, Rita Wilson, and James Van Der Beek.

Bharatpur Airport () is an airport serving Bharatpur, a city in the Chitwan district in Narayani zone in Nepal.
The airport is located southwest of Bharatpur. It is operated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) and is served by Nepal Airlines, the national airline which earns most of its revenue from this airport.
Bharatpur Airport is the country's 4th busiest. It is the main tourist gateway to Chitwan National Park, and is growing fast in terms of aircraft and passenger traffic: the trend for five years shows a steady growth of aircraft and passenger movements. The data up to November 2005 shows a growth of 7.5% and 17.6% against figures in the year 2004.
History.
This airport was built as part of the resettlement and malaria control program in the Chitwan valley, with the assistance of the Government of the United States of America. The first passenger carrying flight landed in the airport on 5 March 1965.
Facilities.
The airport resides at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway which measures .
Bharatpur Airport is the base of Shivani Air(P)Ltd, the first fixed-wing pilot training school in the history of civil aviation in Nepal (although there is a fixed-wing aircraft flight training school under the Nepalese Army Air Service). Shivania Air provides commercial pilot license training of international standard (FAA, ICAO).
Expansion.
The airport was initially served by domestic flights with grass runway from Tribhuvan International Airport, Kathmandu and Pokhara Airport in Pokhara by the country's national airline Nepal Airlines. After many years of lobbying by the local people and expatriates living abroad, limited expansion of the airport was carried out; a new terminal was built and the 1158-metre runway was paved to enable medium-sized aircraft used by Nepal Airlines and Nicon Air to operate. The work was completed in October 2005.

Rezball

Rezball, short for "reservation ball," is the avid Native American following of basketball, particularly a style of play particular to Native American teams of some areas.
Style of Play.
Rezball is transition-based basketball that forces tempo with aggressive play, quick scoring (or at least shooting) and assertive defense that looks to force turnovers through pressing or half-court traps. There are slight variations from program to program. Keys to a good rezball offensive play are sound fundamentals and being in very good condition. Many Native Americans adapted to basketball to bring them together with each other and is their way to overcome strive on the reservation.
Following.
The Apache, Pueblo and Navajo tribes in northeastern Arizona and northwesthern New Mexico are home to several high schools. In these areas basketball is very important. In Arizona, three of the top six largest crowds at a boys' basketball game are rezball games (regardless of school size), with one of the two games tied for the highest-ever attendance being a game between Apache and Navajo schools.
Arizona's Native American largest high school arena's are; the Mustang Arena (Monument Valley) holds 5,000, the Warrior Pavilion (Tuba City) holds 5,000, the Ganado Pavilion (Ganado) hosts 5,500, the Wildcat Den (Chinle) holds 6,000, and the Bee Holdzil Fighting Scouts Events Center (Window Rock) which holds over 6,500. These massive arenas draw large crowds from all around the reservation. The border town teams for Arizona are Winslow, Holbrook and Page--which consists mainly of Native Americans. Some other examples of the intense following of basketball in this region were noted in February 2013 by a writer for "MaxPreps.com", the high school arm of "CBSSports.com". First, early in the month, the Wildcat Den hosted an Arizona Interscholastic Association (AIA) sectional tournament featuring four boys' and four girls' reservation teams. Even though neither Chinle High team participated in the sectional, more than 12,000 attended over the two-day event, with hundreds of fans arriving hours before the doors opened to get the best seats. The scheduling of the AIA's state tournament later that month at Jobing.com Arena in Glendale, home to the NHL's Phoenix Coyotes, also reflected rezball influence. In most states that host multiple state championship games at one site, the last game scheduled is the boys' championship game in the largest enrollment class. Here, however, the marquee slot was reserved for the girls' title game in Class 3A (the state's largest schools are in Class 5A)—a classification that has traditionally been dominated by reservation schools.
New Mexico has produced many high schools that are nationally ranked by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) according to the New Mexico Activities Association (NMAA)--for producing over a 100 State Championships combined, from numerous high schools. New Mexico functions each year on building tradition in basketball for both boys and girls. The big gyms in New Mexico from the Native American high schools are the Bronco Arena (Kirtland Central) holds over 4,000, the Chieftain Pit (Shiprock) holds over 4,500, and the Pueblo Pavilion (Santa Fe Indian School) which holds over 4,500. Both Shiprock and Kirtland Central have a unique glass going around the court. The border town teams for New Mexico are Kirtland Central, Gallup, and Santa Fe Indian--which consists mainly of Native Americans. New Mexico is well known around the country for its power houses in girls basketball such as from Kirtland Central, Shiprock, Gallup, Santa Fe Indian, Navajo Prep and Navajo Pine. Kirtland Central's girls basketball program leads with the most state championships than any other Native American high school. Shiprock has also impacted girls basketball and being major rivals with Kirtland Central. Gallup girls basketball program has been one of the most power houses in New Mexico, playing at a fierce level among larger/competitive high schools in New Mexico. Santa Fe Indian girls program has produced some great talents in the recent years along with Navajo Prep and Navajo Pine both have risen to many achievements. The New Mexico high school state finals takes place at the University of New Mexico's The Pit (arena) and has had major sell outs starting from the late 80's from games between Shiprock and Kirtland Central girls. Many Native American fans from Gallup, Shiprock, Kirtland Central, Laguna Acoma and Santa Fe Indian continue to fill the University of New Mexico's The Pit (arena) every year.
Native American Basketball Invitational (NABI).
Every year the Ak-Chin Indian Community, Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation, Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community host the Native American Basketball Invitational (NABI), an all native tournament sponsored by the Phoenix Suns and Nike. In its third year, it has become recognized as the premier all-native tournament in North America. It hosts 60+ teams from all over the U.S. and Canada, and is instrumental in showcasing the talent of Native American teams to college recruiters, most of whom would not travel to the remote reservation towns to watch them play.

Champion warfare

Champion warfare refers to a type of battle, most commonly found in the epic poetry and myth of ancient history, in which the outcome of the conflict is determined by single combat, an individual duel between the best soldiers ("champions") from each opposing army. Champion warfare can also refer to a battle in which armies actually engage, but champions within the armies fight so effectively as to single-handedly carry the sway of battle, such as in the "Iliad".

Ganghwa County

Ganghwa County is a county in Incheon Metropolitan City, South Korea, where Ganghwa Island, as well the minor islands around it, is located.
History.
Ganghwa has been recognized as preserved most important history of peninsula from the prehistoric age to modern times. Relics and remains of prehistoric age, old stone age and new stone age were found of their various vestiges in Jangjeongni, Sagiri, Dongmangni and others respectively in the symbolic huge stone relics of Bronze Age, more than 80 dolmens were discovered in the vicinity of Bugeunni and neighbouring area, of which giant tombs revealed the existence of inhabitant there.
Dangun, the foundr of Gojoseon, is said to have made an altar on top of Mani-san and offered sacrifices to his ancestors.
In the 9th century, Unified Silla established a garrison on the island to combat piracy. The commander Wang Geon established his military reputation at the garrison, later going on to found the kingdom of Goryeo. In the 13th century, the court of Goryeo took refuge on the island as Mongol forces invaded in 1232. After Goryeo capitulated to the Mongols, the elite forces on the island rose up, beginning the Sambyeolcho Rebellion. 
In the early 19th century, Catholicism was introduced into Korea despite its official proscription by the Korean court. The Korean court clamped down on the illicit French missionaries, massacring French Catholic missionaries and Korean converts alike. At the first battle, the Korean infantry division lost heavily, and General Yang Heon-su concluded that only a large cavalry division could stand up to French firepower. An ambush by Korean forces on a French party attempting to occupy the strategically located Cheondeung Temple (전등사, 傳燈寺) on the island‘s south coast resulted in French casualties. French realization that they were far outnumbered and outgunned forced them to abandon the island and their expedition.
In 1871, following the General Sherman Incident, the United States Navy launched an expedition on the soldiers at Ganghwa Island, resulting in the Battle of Ganghwa.
In 1875 a Japanese ship, Unyo, explored into the restricted areas in name of measuring the coastline, and fired a few shots at the fortress on the island. When a crew boat was sent to the island, Koreans fired a few shots back (Ganghwa Island incident). The Japanese argued that this was an aggression and demanded a treaty. Early in the following year, Japan sent a large force of the Imperial Japanese Navy, and the Treaty of Ganghwa was concluded. That agreement, concluded on Ganghwa Island, officially opened Korea to Japanese external trade for the first time during the 19th century.
Ganghwa was raised to the status of a county in 1906, and incorporated into the Incheon Metropolitan City in 1995.
Speciality.
About 70% of Ganghwa's citizens are engaged in farming, mainly rice. Fishery and forestry are other occupations practiced.
"Hwamunseok" is a well-known traditional fancy matting. Since the Goryeo dynasty (10th-14th centuries), hwamunseok has been produced and exported to China and Japan. The mats are produced in the home handicraft industry. Under an order given by the royal court of the Joseon dynasty over 100 years ago, craftsman Han Chunggyo from the white-mat producing village, Yango-ri, Haesongmyeon, Ganghwa-gun, achieved a successful product by the design of his own idea. Thereafter, various designs have been developed and manufacturing techniques have been improved.
The Ganghwa turnip is a specialty of the area. It has been cultivated since the 5th century. This is recorded in the 17th-century "Dongui Bogam" book of oriental medicine."
World Heritages.
In Ganghwa county, dolmens are registered by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. In three regions of South Korea including Hwasun and Gochang, Ganghwa's dolmens are famous sites to study ancient culture.

Mosaic (film)

Mosaic is an animated superhero film about a new character created by Stan Lee. It features the voice of Anna Paquin as Maggie Nelson with supporting roles done by Kirby Morrow, Cam Clarke, Gary Chalk, Ron Halder, and Nicole Oliver. It was released under the "Stan Lee Presents" banner, which is a series of direct-to-DVD animated films distributed by POW Entertainment with Anchor Bay Entertainment. The story was by Stan Lee, with the script by former X-Men writer Scott Lobdell.
"Mosaic" was released on DVD on January 9, 2007, and had its television premiere on March 10, 2007, on Cartoon Network's Toonami.
Plot.
Aspiring young actress Maggie Nelson (Anna Paquin) gains chameleon-like powers after she is exposed to an electrical storm and a magic rune which her father, an Interpol agent, had brought home to study after it was found at the scene of a murder at a New York City museum. Her powers are from a secret and ancient race known as the Chameliel, who are able to hide in plain sight of the public due to their shape shifting abilities, and she is told all about the Chameliel after meeting a young Chameliel named Mosaic (Kirby Morrow). The murder victim at the museum was a Chameliel who was killed by another Chameliel named Maniken, who is intent on gaining the alchemical powers of his dead wife Facade, and ruling the world. After Maniken kidnaps her father, Maggie becomes determined to help Mosaic to fight Maniken.
They go from New York City, to the catacombs of Rome, to a large radio dish at the magnetic North Pole, trying to stop Maniken from stealing some of the many powerful Chameleon stones that are hidden around the world and sacrificing Maggie's father to use them in a ceremony that will grant Maniken the powers of his wife and rule Earth like a god. During the battle, Maggie uses her acting skills and shape-shifting abilities to fool Maniken into believing she is his dead wife come back to life, to distract him from noticing that Mosaic is planting explosives on the radio dish and getting her father to safety. Also while in battle, it is revealed that Mosaic is Maniken and Facade's son who volunteered to the rest of the Chameliel to go after his father and stop him. They both tumble into an icy gorge, never to rise again. Maggie then sneaks aboard the Interpol copter her father is on, overhearing him vowing to destroy all Chameliel. Upon returning home, she plans to continue acting and agrees to her father's request to continue her studies, but at the same time, she vows to search for the remaining Chameleon stones and use their power for good, and honor Mosaic and the rest of the Chameliel by becoming the new Mosaic.
Maggie's powers.
Maggie's powers include shapeshifting, super strength, the ability to cling to surfaces allowing for scaling walls and ceilings (much like Spider-Man), seeing the DNA of other creatures (which is how she can compare humans to apes), regeneration, infrared vision, camouflage, and the ability to become invisible and mimic voices as well as a gift for understanding the Chameliel language (it is never explained if this ability shows that she can understand other languages or speak them but it makes sense). Strangely, when Maggie becomes invisible, her outline gives off the appearance that she is completely naked, even though she is in fact wearing clothes. Why her clothes are not outlined when her body is invisible is never made clear.

Guido Salvini

Guido Salvini (born 1954) is an Italian judge, based in Milan. He issued European arrest warrants in 2005 against approximatively 20 CIA agents accused of having taken part in the abduction of Abu Omar, the Egyptian cleric in Milan in 2003. The case is known in Italy as the "Imam Rapito affair". Before that, Guido Salvini was in charge of investigations, since July 1988, concerning Italy's strategy of tension during the 1970s.
2000s.
According to Rome prosecutor, Pietro Salvitti, quoted by "La Repubblica", Guido Salvini was one of the targets of a "network" which aimed at slamdering various political opponents of Silvio Berlusconi via the Mitrokhin Commission, headed by senator Paolo Guzzanti, by claiming they worked for or were manipulated by the KGB, the former intelligence agency of the Soviet Union, dissolved in 1991. These targets included former Prime minister Romano Prodi, his staff, General Giuseppe Cucchi (current director of the CESIS), Milan prosecutor Armando Spataro, also in charge of the "Imam Rapito" case, as well as "La Repubblica" reporters Carlo Bonini and Giuseppe D'Avanzo, who discovered the Yellowcake forgery manipulations. This network includes, according to Salvitti, Mario Scaramella, Nicolò Pollari, head of SISMI intelligence agency indicted in the "Imam Rapito" affair, Marco Mancini, n°2 of SISMI arrested in July 2006 for the same reason, as well as Robert Lady, CIA station chief in Milan also indicted in the kidnapping of Abu Omar in Milan.
Strategy of tension.
Guido Salvini started investigating events relating to Italy's strategy of tension, which have involved a NATO stay-behind anti-communist network kwown as Gladio, in July 1988. After 463 interrogations, the investigations produced 60,000 pages. He indicted in 1998 David Carrett, officer of the US Navy, on charges of political and military espionage as well as participation in the 1969 Piazza Fontana bombing. He also indicted Sergio Minetto, Italian official member of Gladio, and "pentito" Carlo Digilio, indicted in the Piazza Fontana investigation. In 1995, Carlo Rocchi, the CIA's man in Milan, was discovered searching for information concerning Operation Gladio. According to Salvini's investigations, the neo-fascist organizations involved in the strategy of tension, ""La Fenice", "Avanguardia nazionale", "Ordine nuovo"" were the "troops" of "occult armed forces", directed by components of the "state apparatus related to the CIA.". The neofascists had decided to kill Mariano Rumor, on retaliation against his decision not to proclaim the state of emergency following the Piazza Fontana bombing — which, according to neo-fascist Vincenzo Vinciguerra, was one of the main objectives of this bombing.
