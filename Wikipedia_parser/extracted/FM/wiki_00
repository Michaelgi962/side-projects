Mark Ingram, Jr.

Mark Ingram, Jr. (born December 21, 1989) is an American football running back for the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the University of Alabama, won the Heisman Trophy, and was a member of a national championship team. The New Orleans Saints chose him in the first round of the 2011 NFL Draft.
During his sophomore college season in 2009, Ingram won the first Heisman Trophy ever awarded to an Alabama Crimson Tide player, set the Crimson Tide's single-season rushing record with 1,658 yards, was recognized as a unanimous All-American, and helped lead the Tide to an undefeated 14–0 season and the 2010 BCS National Championship.
Early years.
Ingram was born in Hackensack, New Jersey, the son of former NFL wide receiver Mark Ingram, Sr. He attended Grand Blanc Community High School in Grand Blanc, Michigan during his freshman, sophomore and junior years, and then Flint Southwestern Academy in Flint, Michigan for his senior year.
He was a four-year starter on his high schools' football teams, running for 2,546 yards and 38 touchdowns in his final two seasons. He was Saginaw Valley MVP, Area Player of the Year, and an All-State selection as a senior. Ingram also played defensively as a cornerback, totaling 84 tackles and eight interceptions his senior year. Rivals.com ranked Ingram as a four-star "athlete"—a designation used for football recruits who have the potential to play multiple positions.
Track and field.
In addition to football, Ingram ran track for the Flint (MI) Southwestern Academy track and field team, where he was nine-time All-State track star. His personal bests are 10.69 seconds in the 100 meters and 21.90 seconds in the 200 meters. He also competed in the long jump, recording a personal best of 7.25 meters.
College career.
Ingram received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Alabama, where he played for coach Nick Saban's Alabama Crimson Tide football team from 2008 to 2010.
Freshman.
Ingram played behind Glen Coffee his freshman year, and he was selected to the 2008 SEC All-Freshman Team. His team-high 12 touchdowns also set the Alabama freshman school record.
Sophomore.
In the season opener of the 2009–10 season (Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game: #5 Alabama vs #7 Virginia Tech), Ingram was the player of the game with 150 rushing yards, a rushing touchdown, and a receiving touchdown.
On October 17, 2009, in a game against South Carolina, Ingram ran for a career-high 246 yards. He was named SEC Offensive Player of the Week.
In the 2009 SEC Championship Game versus the undefeated and top-ranked Florida Gators, Ingram rushed for 113 yards and three touchdowns, while also catching two passes for 76 receiving yards to combine for 189 all-purpose yards. In the game, Ingram also surpassed Bobby Humphrey's single-season rushing record for the Crimson Tide, reaching 1,542 rushing yards for the season.
On December 12, Ingram won the Heisman Trophy in the closest vote in the award's 75-year history. Ingram was Alabama's first Heisman winner, the third consecutive sophomore to win the award, and the first running back to win the award since Reggie Bush. At the time Ingram was nine days shy of his twentieth birthday, making him the youngest player to win the Heisman. Ingram was recognized as a unanimous first-team All-American, having received first-team honors from the Associated Press, American Football Coaches Association, Football Writers Association of America, "Sporting News", and Walter Camp Football Foundation.
On January 7, 2010 Alabama defeated Texas 37–21 to win the BCS National Championship. Ingram received honors as Offensive MVP after rushing for 116 yards and 2 touchdowns on 22 carries. For the 2009 season, Ingram rushed for 1,658 yards and 17 touchdowns. He also had 334 receiving yards with 3 touchdowns.
Junior.
Ingram was ruled out for the season opener after undergoing minor knee surgery the week prior to the opening game against San Jose State. Sophomore running back Trent Richardson filled in for Ingram for the first two games, after it was announced that the junior was not likely to play against Penn State on September 11. He eventually made his season debut in a road game against Duke, rushing for 151 yards on nine carries, including two touchdowns in the first quarter, as Alabama routed the Blue Devils 62–13.
After a 3–0 start, Alabama traveled to Fayetteville to face the Arkansas Razorbacks in the conference opener for the Crimson Tide. Ingram and the Alabama offense came back from a 20–7 third quarter deficit to take a 24–20 lead with just over three minutes remaining, when Ingram capped a short, 12-yard drive with a one yard touchdown run. Ingram finished with 157 yards on 21 attempts and two touchdowns. He did not break 100 yards again during the regular season. On October 9, Alabama suffered their first loss since the 2009 Sugar Bowl when the team fell 35–21 to South Carolina in Williams-Brice Stadium. Ingram was held to a season-low 41 yards on 11 carries in the loss.
Ingram finished his junior season with 875 yards on 158 carries with 13 touchdowns, with an additional 282 yards receiving and a touchdown. On January 6, 2011, Ingram announced he would forego his senior season and enter the 2011 NFL Draft. At the time of the announcement, he was projected as a first round pick.
Professional career.
New Orleans Saints.
The New Orleans Saints selected Ingram with the 28th pick in the 2011 NFL Draft—the same pick number the Giants used to draft his father, Mark Ingram, Sr., twenty-four years earlier. Ingram was the first running back drafted in 2011; since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger, this was the latest pick used for the first running back chosen in an NFL draft. The Saints acquired the pick from the New England Patriots, trading their second-round selection (#56 overall) and their first-round selection in 2012 to do so. As Alabama head coach Nick Saban is part of Patriots head coach Bill Belichick's coaching tree, the Patriots were widely assumed to be interested in drafting Ingram themselves. On July 28, 2011, Ingram decided on the number #28 in honor of his and his father's draft pick number. The next day Ingram agreed with the Saints on a four year contract, with three years guaranteed and a fifth year option. The contract is worth $7.41 million, with a $3.89 million signing bonus.
On August 12, 2011, Ingram scored his first touchdown as a Saint on a 14-yard run in a preseason game against the San Francisco 49ers.
On September 25, 2011, Ingram scored his first touchdown in regular season play as a Saint on a tough 13-yard run against the Houston Texans.
On October 23, 2011, late in the game on Sunday night in a runaway win against the Indianapolis Colts Ingram injured his heel. It was considered a 'day-to-day' injury at first, but Ingram was unable to practice the entire week and missed the following game versus the winless St. Louis Rams which ended in a 31-21 loss for the Saints.

Giannini sextuplets

The Giannini sextuplets (born January 11, 1980) are a set of sextuplets born to Rosanna Caviglia Giannini and Franco Giannini at the Villa Medici at Careggi Hospital near Florence, Italy. They were the second set of sextuplets in the world to survive past infancy, and the first surviving sextuplets to be born in Europe. 
The Giannini sextuplets were born six years to the date after the Rosenkowitz sextuplets, the first surviving sextuplets on record. The sextuplets are made up of four boys and two girls. They are, in birth order;
Backstory.
Rosanna Caviglia was born and raised in the Casentino Valley and made a living as an elementary school teacher in the provincial town of Arezzo. She married Franco Giannini in 1976.
The children were conceived after a series of hormone treatments brought on by Rosanna Giannini's worry that she was starting an unnaturally early menopause at the age of 29. When she went to her gynecologist for her first ultrasound, she was told not to publicly release the news for fear that it would cause an international media circus.
Birth and subsequent media attention.
The six babies were born at dawn on January 11, 1980. Once the news broke about the birth, it brought them instant fame in their native Italy, where they were compared to the Bradford family from the popular American dramedy "Eight is Enough", as well as internationally, with many news agencies competing for interviews. In the Italian newspapers, stories on the new brood pushed gossip about Princess Caroline off the front pages, and they were invited to Tokyo to take part in a Japanese television special. Their story was also covered in the 1984 book "Vivere con sei gemelli" ("Living with sextuplets"), as told to journalist Achille Mezzadri, famous for his work for "Gente" magazine.
In 1986, Rosanna Giannini signed an exclusive contract with a laundry detergent company in Italy, putting her and her children on television in advertisements for the brand. Of raising the children, Rosanna Giannini said, "There was always someone around; friends and relatives would come in to give us a hand." As far as assistance or charity were concerned, the Tuscan regional government helped the family with a stipend, but apart from that and the revenue received for a few years from the laundry detergent advertisements, the family supported themselves. The task was not easy; Rosanna Giannini estimated that she washed five loads of laundry every day, and that train travel for the entire family cost 250,000 lira a month (€195 in 2009).
Current whereabouts.
As the years went on, family problems (such as the death of Rosanna's father and a transplant to replace Francesco's defective kidney) caused the family to make their lives more private. Rosanna Giannini noted that a priest friend of hers warned her that the publicity would "cause a harmful imbalance" in their lives, but she said, "Nothing happened that was harmful... then the interest ended. Fortunately."
Now living private lives, none of the sextuplets have any interest in contributing to interviews for television. In regard to their ambitions, Rosanna Giannini said, "They are following other dreams, but if they wish to do I'm not going to forbid it. I'll only tell them to stay with their feet always on the ground." Follow-up stories about the family have been published by the newspaper "Corriere della Sera" in 2000 in time for their 20th birthday celebration, and in 2004 by the magazine "TV Sorrisi e Canzoni".
As of 2004, four of the six sextuplets are studying at university: Linda and Letizia are studying literature, Fabrizio is studying hydroelectricity, and Giorgio is studying economics. Roberto and Francesco work at a textile company, one as a loom operator and the other as a clerk.

United States Senate election in Illinois, 1998

The 1998 United States Senate election in Illinois was held on November 3, 1998. Incumbent Democrat U.S. Senator Carol Moseley Braun decided to run for re-election, despite the number of controversies she was in during her first term. Republican State Senator Peter Fitzgerald was his parties' primary with a slim margin of victory. He ended up defeating the incumbent with a margin of victory of approximately 3%.
Campaign.
During Moseley Braun's first term as U.S. Senator, she was plagued by several major controversies. Moseley Braun was the subject of a 1993 Federal Elections Commission investigation over $249,000 in unaccounted-for campaign funds. The agency found some small violations, but took no action against Moseley Braun, citing a lack of resources. Moseley Braun only admitted to bookkeeping errors. The Justice Department turned down two requests for investigations from the IRS.In 1996, Moseley Braun made a private trip to Nigeria, where she met with dictator Sani Abacha. Despite U.S. sanctions against that country, due to Abacha's actions, the Senator did not notify, nor register her trip with, the State Department. She subsequently defended Abacha's human rights records in Congress.
Peter Fitzgerald, a State Senator, barely won the Republican primary, spending over $7 million. He had a major finances advantage, as he was a multimillionaire. He ended up spending $12 million in his election victory.
In September, she created controversy again by using the word Nigger to describe how she claims to be a victim of racism.
Most polls over the first few months showed Moseley-Braun trailing badly. However, after she was helped in the final month by notable Democrats such as First Lady Hillary Clinton and U.S. Congressman Luis V. Gutierrez, three polls published in the last week showed her within the margin of error, and, in one poll, running even with Fitzgerald.

<doc id="21343916" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21343916" title="Eramosa">
Eramosa

The Eramosa is a Silurian stratigraphic unit exposed along the Niagara Escarpment in Ontario and western New York State. In the late nineteenth century it was an important source of building stone in Hamilton, Ancaster and Waterdown, and in the late twentieth century quarries in a similar unit, also called the Eramosa, near Wiarton in the Bruce Peninsula, became an important source of dimension stone at a time when most of the other resources of similar stone were depleted. Work in these quarries led to the discovery of exceptionally well preserved fossils (the Eramosa lagerstätte). On the east Mountain at Hamilton, a well-developed cave system was discovered in the Eramosa and has now been designated as the Eramosa Karst Conservation Area.
Stratigraphy.
The term was first used for a stratigraphic unit by Williams (1915) who named the Eramosa Member (of the Lockport Formation) for the bituminous dolomites exposed below the Guelph Formation along the Eramosa River, northeast of Guelph, Ontario. No detailed description of the type section has ever been published, and the status of the unit has been subject to many different interpretations. Until recently, the Eramosa in Ontario was regarded as the highest Member of the Lockport Formation, with gradational contacts with the Goat Island Member (below) and the Guelph Formation (above). In 1995, the US Geological Survey proposed a revised stratigraphy based on studies in the Niagara region. It extended the Lockport to Group status and included, from base to top, the Gasport, Goat Island, Eramosa, and Guelph as Formations within the Lockport Group. In a “reference section” in the Niagara River Gorge, the Eramosa was divided into six “units” recognized throughout the Niagara region, but a shaly lower unit previously named for the Hamilton area (the Vinemount Member) was transferred to the Goat Island Formation. Brunton (2009) has proposed a revision for Ontario which restores the Vinemount Member to the Eramosa and recognizes two other members.
Age.
The exact age and correlation of the Eramosa are still uncertain. Conodonts at first indicated that the Eramosa age was Ludlovian (c.420 Ma), but recent studies of both conodonts and the Eramosa lagerstätte suggest an earlier, late Wenlockian (c.425 Ma) age.
Paleoenvironment.
The rocks forming the Eramosa are mostly dolomites, but the composition varies from almost pure, grey-weathering, fine grained dolomite (at Ancaster) to shaly, bituminous, brown-weathing, bioturbated dolomites. Fossils are common at some localities, scarce at others, and chert is generally a minor component. The most characteristic feature is bituminous shaly interbeds. Probably the Eramosa was deposited in several related environments, most likely including shallow, restricted (and poorly oxygenated) marine waters. Among the fossils, perhaps the most spectacular are the eurypterids, an extinct form of scorpions. Some species lived in fresh or brackish water, but Silurian examples were marine.
The exceptionally preserved biota are present in a stratum of rock about 8 m thick, which extends for around 16 km in the South Bruce Peninsula, Ontario.

tagConnect is an Intelink-based bookmark tool based loosely on del.icio.us. It combines traditional bookmarking with a community, so that users can see and search each other's bookmarks, comment on them, and organize them by flat, non-hierarchical categories called "tags."
At first, this system appears to be just another way of bookmarking pages. However, upon further use, users will begin to see the value of sharing their bookmarks and exploring others'. For example, they will find users whose tastes are similar to their own, and thereby find web pages of interest that they otherwise would not have found—users with similar interest are acting as your search engine. Social bookmarking also cuts down on email because it reduces the number "hey, did you see this link" emails.

Nate Montana

Nathaniel Joseph "Nate" Montana (born October 3, 1989) is an American football quarterback who is currently a free agent. After walking-on at Notre Dame as a freshman in 2008, he transferred to Pasadena City College in 2009, went back to Notre Dame in 2010, transferred to Montana in 2011, and finally transferred to West Virginia Wesleyan in 2012. Montana is the son of Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana.
Early years.
In high school, Montana was a reserve quarterback at De La Salle High School in Concord, California, a suburb east of San Francisco.
College career.
After graduating from high school in 2008, he enrolled at Notre Dame and joined the Fighting Irish football team's coach Charlie Weis as a walk-on, with the hope of landing a scholarship as a sophomore. Following Montana's freshman year at Notre Dame, he found himself well down the depth chart at quarterback. In order to increase his playing time, he withdrew from Notre Dame in 2009 and tried out for Mt. SAC's football program but would not be the starting quarterback and later enrolled at Pasadena City College in southern California as a redshirt freshman. Montana re-enrolled at Notre Dame in January 2010. He was the quarterback behind Tommy Rees and Dayne Crist. He played in three games for the Fighting Irish as a junior in 2010, and was 9 for 18 for 116 yards with an interception. On February 14, 2011, Montana confirmed he was transferring to the University of Montana, a top FCS program in the Big Sky Conference. As the transfer was from FBS to FCS, he was eligible to play immediately. He transferred to West Virginia Wesleyan, a Division II program, in May 2012.
Personal life.
Nate is the third child and older son of legendary NFL quarterback Joe Montana and Jennifer Wallace, a model/actress. His two older sisters Alexandra (b. 1985) and Elizabeth (b. 1986) also attended the University of Notre Dame. His brother Nick (b. 1992) was the starting quarterback at nationally ranked Oaks Christian in Westlake Village and was thought to be one of the top prospects in the nation in 2010. Nick committed to the Washington Huskies and redshirted his freshman year, but following the 2011 season, he left the Huskies to play at the junior college level as a sophomore at Mt. San Antonio College in 2012. Nick currently plays for the Tulane Green Wave.
Montana was one of eight Notre Dame football players (and 11 total athletes) arrested for alleged underage drinking on July 16, 2010. While living in the state of Montana in 2011, Nate was arrested in Missoula on June 3 on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol.

Bennett-McBride House

The Bennett-McBride House is a house in the Central neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a contributing property within the Healy Block Residential Historic District. This house was listed on the National Register in 1977, before the rest of the block was listed in 1993.
Theron P. Healy moved to the city of Minneapolis in 1884 and decided to capitalize on the need for housing in the fast-growing city. Queen Anne Style architecture was rapidly becoming popular after the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876. The Bennett-McBride house was built in 1891 for local lumberman H.H. Bennett. While the exterior is similar to most of the Queen Anne houses on the block, the interior has some distinguishing features, particularly in its woodwork. The dining room features quarter-sawn oak, and the lacy fretwork has been well preserved, both on the inside and outside.
The house was selected in the Goodwill Industries Designer Showcase Home in 1976, as a local part of the American Bicentennial celebration. In 1977 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and its recognition spurred research into other homes on the block.

Fort Hamilton Parkway was a station on the demolished section of the BMT Culver Line. It originally had three tracks and 2 side platforms, although near the end of its life only utilized one track and 1 of the side platforms, due to the other 2 tracks being removed. It opened on November 11, 1919, but when the IND South Brooklyn Line was extended to Ditmas Avenue and converted most of the line to the Independent Subway System, the station's service was replaced by the Culver Shuttle. On May 28, 1959, the station and the line were reduced from three tracks to two. By December 1960 the shuttle was reduced to a single track and platform, due to the December 1960 nor'easter and low ridership. The station closed on May 11, 1975. The next stop to the north was Ninth Avenue. The next stop to the south was 13th Avenue. The freight line that ran beneath the station and currently leads to the 36th–38th Street Yard can still be found embedded in the pavement across Fort Hamilton Parkway.

Winamac Southern Railway

The Winamac Southern Railway is a short-line railroad in northern Indiana, United States, operated under lease by the U S Rail Corporation. It owns two lines radiating from Logansport to Kokomo and Bringhurst, and formerly a third to Winamac, all former Pennsylvania Railroad lines acquired from Conrail in 1993. It hauls mainly outbound grain and inbound agricultural supplies, connecting with the Toledo, Peoria and Western Railway at Logansport and with the Central Railroad of Indianapolis at Kokomo. Until 2009, the Central Railroad of Indianapolis (a RailAmerica subsidiary) operated the company as agent.
History.
As the Pennsylvania Railroad assembled its system in northern Indiana, Logansport became a major hub, with seven lines radiating in all directions (the only other service to the city was a line of the Wabash Railroad, now Norfolk Southern Railway). Conrail took over four of these in 1976, and abandoned the line to Marion in the 1980s. The remaining lines to Winamac, Kokomo, and Bringhurst, known as the "Logansport Cluster", were spun off to the Winamac Southern, which began operations in March 1993. The new railroad was controlled by Daniel R. Frick of Frick Services, a storage and handling company, who also owned J.K. Line, Inc. to the north.
In September 1995, Winamac Southern sold the line from Winamac to the yard at 18th Street in Logansport to A&R Line, Inc., another new shortline owned by Frick, which was operated by J.K. Line employees using a locomotive leased from that company. Winamac Southern retained trackage rights through Logansport, in order to connect its Bringhurst and Kokomo lines. Subsequently, the Central Railroad of Indianapolis (CERA), which serves Kokomo, began operating the remaining Winamac Southern lines as agent.
The arrangement between Winamac Southern and CERA was to end at the end of 2008, and the U S Rail Corporation filed with the Surface Transportation Board to lease and operate the Winamac Southern, as well as a CERA-operated segment near Kokomo owned by the Kokomo Grain Company. However, the parties discovered that the trackage rights over A&R, which had since been merged into the Toledo, Peoria and Western Railway, had never been authorized, and concurrently filed for approval of the 1995 agreement. The STB rejected the latter notice of exemption, citing the opposition of the TP&W to continuance of trackage rights, thus requiring a more extensive proceeding. U S Rail began operating the Winamac Southern as its Kokomo Division in early 2009.

The Delta landfill is a landfill south of Vancouver B.C.
Vancouver has owned and operated the Vancouver Landfill in Delta since 1966. It's now used by Vancouver, Delta, B.C., Richmond, White Rock, the University Endowment Lands and portions of South Surrey -- or about 40 per cent of the population of the region. 
Garbage collected in Vancouver by City crews is taken to the Vancouver South Transfer Station (VSTS) and then transported in City of Vancouver tractor trailers to the City's Landfill in Delta. 
At the current maximum authorized disposal rate, the Delta landfill could accommodate Vancouver's solid waste disposal needs for another 30 to 40 years.
The Delta Landfill is located beside the Fraser River. The site is a dump for demolition materials, such as wood and asphalt shakes.
Fire.
In November 1999 a landfill fire started at the Delta Shake and Shingle site. A state of emergency was declared in Delta to help the firefighters battle the underground blaze at the landfill. The site is a dump for demolition materials, such as wood and asphalt shakes, resulting in an environmentally hazardous smoke. High pollution levels were also detected in water running off from the fire. Water poured on the Delta Shake and Shingle Site by firefighters has mixed with naturally decaying wood to produce potentially toxic run-off. At the peak of the fire it covered an area more than a hectare and burned 20 meters deep. The entire operation took over six months at a cost of four million dollars.

Castilleja cinerea

Castilleja cinerea is a species of Indian paintbrush known by the common name ashgray Indian paintbrush. It is endemic to San Bernardino County, California, where it is known only from the San Bernardino Mountains. There are about 20 occurrences known.
Description.
This is a perennial herb growing up to 15 centimeters tall and covered in a coat of ash-gray woolly hairs. The leaves are linear or narrowly lance-shaped and one or two centimeters long. The inflorescence is made up of fuzzy dull to bright reddish or purplish pink bracts between which emerge smaller yellowish to greenish flowers. The color of the inflorescence is influenced by the environment of the plant; those with more northern exposures tend to have yellowish flowers and those facing south have more reddish flowers. 
Like other "Castilleja" species, this plant parasitizes other species for water and nutrients; "C. cinerea" is generally found tapping buckwheats ("Eriogonum" spp.) and sagebrushes ("Artemisia" spp.). 
Habitat.
"Castilleja cinerea" grows in several habitat types, including dry desert and sagebrush scrub, woodland, and coniferous forest. It is also known from the unique quartzite pebble plain habitat in these mountains, which it shares with other endemics such as "Arenaria ursina". 
Threats.
The "Castilleja cinerea" plant is a federally listed threatened species. Threats to its survival include development of its habitat for human use, recreation, off-road vehicles, logging, grazing, mining, and invasive species of plants.

Cape Blomidon is a headland located on the Bay of Fundy coast of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.
Cape Blomidon is located in Kings County at the northeast edge of the Blomidon Peninsula. Its geology largely comprises sedimentary sandstone, which is unique since it is connected to the North Mountain range and made up of tholeiitic basalt. Cape Blomidon features distinctive reddish-coloured cliffs that reach up to 100 metres in height above the Minas Basin, which stretches out to the east. Cape Split is the geologic continuation of the North Mountain range and juts off the Blomidon Peninsula to the northwest.
The cape and much of the coastal area of the Blomidon Peninsula are protected by Blomidon Provincial Park. Visitor access to this park is located at the southern edge of the peninsula, approximately 3.5 kilometres south of Cape Blomidon.
The name "Cape Blomidon" was officially approved on 1 October 1959, although the name had been in use many years beforehand. French explorer Samuel de Champlain called the cape Cap Poutrincourt and local Acadian settlers called it Cap Baptiste. English speaking settlers called it Cape Porcupine. However, the common term used was Cape Blowmedown, from which "Blomidon" is derived.

Presidential memorandum

A presidential memorandum is a type of executive instrument typically issued by the President of the United States to manage and govern the actions, practices and policies of the various departments and agencies found under the executive branch of the United States government. Presidential memoranda and executive orders appear to be very closely related, if not identical. However, the lack of a definition for either of these mechanisms has made it difficult to make a clear distinction between them. Presidential memoranda are generally considered less prestigious than executive orders. Presidential memoranda do not have an established process for issuance or publication. 
There are three types of memorandum: presidential determination or presidential finding, memorandum of disapproval, and hortatory memorandum.
History.
In the past, presidential memoranda have been referred to as presidential letters.
Presidential determination.
Presidential determination, or presidential finding, are memoranda required by a statute and must be issued before certain actions are taken. For example, a presidential determination on the status of a country must be released before sanctions are imposed on the country.
Memorandum of disapproval.
A memorandum of disapproval is a public veto statement.
Hortatory memorandum.
A hortatory memorandum is issued as a broad policy statement, but unlike a Presidential Proclamation is directed to executive agencies.

The Lakes Sea Bird was a two-seat floatplane built during 1912 by the Lakes Flying Company using the fuselage of the Avro Duigan. It gave many visitors to Windermere their first flight in the suummer of 1913
Development.
After damaging his aircraft and returned to Australia the fuselage and tail unit was sold to the Lakes Flying Co. based at Windermere, who rebuilt it as a two-seat floatplane. The straight parallel-chord high aspect ratio wings of irregular three-by layout resembled those of Avro's Avro Type D. It was originally fitted with a single central two step float, later changed to a pair of narrower floats, and demountable so that the aircraft could readily be used as a landplane. It was powered by a rotary 9-cylinder Gnome of 50 hp (37 kW),

Richard Dacres (Royal Navy officer)

Sir Richard Dacres (September 1761 – 22 January 1837) was an officer of the British Royal Navy who saw service during the American War of Independence, and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. A member of a substantial naval dynasty, he eventually rose to the rank of vice admiral.
Family and early life.
Richard Dacres was born in September 1761, the fifth son of Richard and Mary Dacres, and younger brother to James Richard Dacres. The Dacres would eventually become a substantial naval dynasty; James Richard rose to be a vice-admiral, his son Barrington became a post-captain, and James became a vice-admiral. Richard's own son Sydney would eventually be an admiral, and First Sea Lord.
American war.
Dacres himself entered the navy in 1775 to serve aboard the 50-gun fourth rate under Captain Francis Banks. He was present at the evacuation of Boston, the capture of New York —serving under Sir Peter Parker— the occupation of Aquidneck Island, and in various other services. He remained aboard "Renown" until 1778, when he returned to England and joined the frigate "Apollo", under Captain Philemon Pownall, and was present at the capture of the French frigate on 31 January 1779.
Dacres then served aboard , flagship of Sir Charles Hardy, Commander-in Chief of the Channel Fleet. Hardy promoted Dacres to lieutenant into the frigate , under Captain the Honourable William Finch, with whom he sailed to the West Indies in early 1780. On 10/11 October 1780 "Amazon" narrowly escaped destruction during a violent hurricane, having to cut down her masts and throw her guns and anchors overboard to prevent the ship from capsizing. Twenty of her crew were drowned or badly hurt.
He then served as first lieutenant of the 74-gun , Captain Charles Thompson. He was present with Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves's fleet at the Battle of the Chesapeake in 1781, Rear-Admiral Samuel Hood's fleet at the Battle of St. Kitts in 1782 and Admiral George Brydges Rodney's fleet at the Battle of the Saintes in 1782.
Dacres remained in "Alcide" till 1783, when he was appointed to , Captain Herbert Sawyer, guard ship at Portsmouth, remaining in her for two years, before following Commodore Sawyer into his flagship, the 50-gun , on the North American Station, until paid off in September 1788. During the Spanish Armament of 1790, Dacres was first appointed to the 64-gun , then to , flagship of now Rear Admiral Sawyer. After the crisis was resolved peacefully, Dacres returned to half-pay until the outbreak of the war with Revolutionary France in February 1793.
War with France.
He was initially given command of the hired armed brig "Union"; before being appointed first lieutenant of the 74-gun , under the command of Captain John Colpoys. With "Hannibal" Dacres became part of the squadron despatched under Admiral Alan Gardner to the reinforce the British possessions in the West Indies.
"Hannibal" was put out of commission in early 1794, and he was appointed first lieutenant of the frigate , commanded by Captain W. Sidney Smith, but remained there only a short time before moving to the 90-gun second rate , serving under his old commander, now Rear-Admiral John Colpoys. Dacres was promoted to commander on 10 March 1795 into the 14-gun sloop . While captain of "Childers" Dacres captured the French Coast guard cutter "Vigilante", of six guns, in the Bay of Saint Brieux. On 31 October he was appointed post captain on the 20-gun , which formed part of Richard Strachan's squadron in the English Channel.
In early 1797, Dacres took command of the frigate . He managed to slip away from the mutiny at the Nore, and then escorted a fleet of valuable merchant ships to the Baltic. He captured numerous French and Dutch privateers over the next two years. "Astrea" was paid off in 1799, and Dacres was again unemployed until early 1801, when he was appointed to command of the 80-gun , accompanying Sir Robert Calder in his voyage to the Caribbean, following Ganteaume's escape from Brest. On his return to England, he was appointed to the 68-gun , guard ship at Spithead, remaining there until the cessation of hostilities in early 1802. He then sailed to Jamaica in with the squadron under Sir George Campbell, but ill-health soon forced him to return home. On the renewal of the war in 1803, Dacres was appointed to command of the Sea Fencibles at Dartmouth.
In 1806 Sir W. Sidney Smith specifically requested Dacres join him in the Mediterranean as his flag captain aboard the 80-gun "Pompee". In this role Dacres went on to see service in the amphibious operations at Calabria, leading to the Battle of Maida, and later Admiral John Thomas Duckworth's failed Dardanelles Operation and the Alexandria expedition in February 1807. Dacres then returned to England after "Pompee"s recall, arriving in June 1807. He was then ordered to take the "Pompee" to join Vice-Admiral Henry Stanhope's squadron for service in the second expedition to Copenhagen. He was involved in the subsequent Battle of Copenhagen, where he and the navy provided support for the besieging forces.
Later life.
Dacres returned from the campaign, which proved to be his last command at sea. On 2 February 1808 he was appointed the first governor of the Royal Naval Asylum after its move to Greenwich, serving there until August 1816. He was promoted to rear-admiral on 29 March 1817 on the Retired List, and a vice-admiral on 22 July 1830. He was nominated a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Guelphic Order on 25 January 1836, and died at Balibroke Villas, near Bath, Somerset on 22 January 1837 at the age of 75.
Family and personal life.
In 1788 he married Martha Phillips Milligan, by whom he had at least four children; his son Richard James Dacres (1799–1886) joined the army and rose to be a field marshal, while Sydney Colpoys Dacres (1805–1884), went on to be an admiral and First Naval Lord. His eldest daughter Martha married Rear Admiral Sir William Fairbrother Carrol in 1813, while the younger, Mary, married Lieutenant Colonel Henry Stephen Olivier in 1823.

St. Patrick's School Maple Ridge

St. Patrick's School is a Canadian independent, coeducational Roman Catholic elementary school located in Maple Ridge, British Columbia.
As of September 2012, the school has about 185 students and 22 staff members.
The school and its parish was established in 1956.
History.
In 1950, Father Steele began the task of building the school on five forested acres in the heart of Haney, now part of the larger district municipality of Maple Ridge. The school was opened in September 1956 with a co-educational enrollment of 128 students encompassing grades one to eight. The Sisters of St. Joseph of London, Ontario, were the first teachers. Sisters Winnifred, Appolonia and Wendelin aided Sister Eugene, the first principal.
Initially, only five rooms on the lower floor were available for the students' use, as the upstairs consisted of Father's living quarters, a confessional and a large hall where Mass was said. The students took their gym out of doors year round.
Much has changed at the school since its establishment. Kindergarten classes were introduced in 1970. To accommodate a growing enrollment, portable classrooms and the St. Patrick's Centre (gym) were later built. The last sister, Sister Sharon McNally, left in June 1985. The convent was changed into a school annex to include a larger library, a video room and two meeting rooms.
Currently the new wing of the school is being built. The wing will have three classrooms (grades five through seven) and one music room along with a male and female bathrooms. The library and meeting room will be restored in the Father Varelle Center.
Religious life.
Christian-education philosophy.
The Christian-education program is designed to foster growth in the student's faith, in the knowledge of their faith, and in the understanding of themselves as Christian people. Prayer is said in the morning as well as at lunch time.
Religious-education classes.
Participation in the religious-education classes is an integral and vital part of the education and formation of each student in the school. It helps lead them to study and learn the history and content of the Catholic faith. The objective remains to create in them a deep and lifelong love for the Church, its sacraments and prayer life. The religiious-education classes take place during the school hours.
Masses.
The importance of the Mass is recognized at the school both as a way of increasing the faith of the individual and helping in the building of Christian community. On the first Friday of each month, there is a school Mass in the church. There is an additional Mass for only the primary and intermediate grades once a month.
Administration.
The pastor is Rev. Father Richard Au STL since Summer 2005.
Clive Heah is the principal and the school board is the Catholic Independent Schools of the Vancouver Archdiocese (CISVA).
Uniforms.
All students must wear a uniform. The stated purpose for uniforms, often set forth in school-uniform policies, include reducing clothing expenditures for parents as well as avoiding distinctions among children based on whose parents can afford to buy them fashionable clothing to wear to school. The conservative clothing is also said to reduce distractions and help with student identification, ensuring that a stranger will stand out among the uniformed students. It also helps show a sense of modesty by all students.

<doc id="21344449" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21344449" title="Alberto Jonás">
Alberto Jonás

Alberto Jonás (1868, Madrid – 1943, Philadelphia) was a Spanish pianist, composer, and piano pedagogue. Although not much is known about his life, as a pianist he was regarded as a virtuoso on the level of Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Moriz Rosenthal, Leopold Godowsky, Józef Hofmann, and Josef Lhévinne. He also ranked, during the 1920s and 30s, amongst the greatest and most sought-after keyboard pedagogues of the time.
Life and early career.
Born in Madrid to German parents Julius Jonas, a businessman, and Doris Sachse, his musical talents were recognized at an early age. King Alfonso XII of Spain received the young child in a private audience at the Royal Palace of Madrid in 1880 and Jonás was immediately hailed as a prodigy. He initially studied at the Madrid Royal Conservatory with Manuel Mendizábal in piano (Mendizábal had been Isaac Albéniz's piano teacher) and Ciriaco Olave in organ, graduating at the age of 12. For the next six years he travelled and lived in Belgium, England, Germany, and France studying business, in accordance to his parents' desires for a career in finance, and also giving some public performances. At this time, Jonás started also to become a polyglot, mastering fluently the French, Russian, German, English, and Spanish languages.
Brussels, 1886-1890.
In 1886, at the age of 18 and against the will of his parents, who kept trying to dissuade him from pursuing a career as a concert pianist, he entered the Brussels Conservatory, where he studied for four years with noted Franz Liszt pupil Arthur De Greef and composition with François-Auguste Gevaert.
St. Petersburg, Germany, Austria, 1890-1893.
Upon graduating from Brussels in 1890, he entered the first international Anton Rubinstein Competition, which was being held at the St. Petersburg Conservatory. Even though he did not win the coveted First Prize in piano (it went to Nikolay Dubasov), he nevertheless made an extraordinary impression on Anton Rubinstein, who immediately invited him to be one the handful of pianists who had the privilege of being his students. He then worked with Rubinstein in St. Petersburg for the next three years. During his sojourn there, he became a recognized pianist and teacher, and soon befriended fellow Rubinstein students Josef Lhévinne, Józef Hofmann, Felix Blumenfeld, and Teresa Carreño, who all held his playing in high esteem. During this period he also met Ignacy Jan Paderewski, who acted as a mentor and gave him some lessons (in particular on his own Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 17, which Jonás would later often perform) and encouraged him to continue his studies in music. In 1891 he made his debut in Berlin as a soloist with the Berlin Philharmonic under Hans von Bülow, receiving rave reviews.
United States 1893-1904.
In 1893 he moved to New York, soon making a debut with the Symphony Society of New York in Carnegie Hall playing the Paderewski Concerto conducted by Walter Damrosch. In 1894, he was named professor at the Music School of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, later becoming President and Director of the Michigan Conservatory of Music in Detroit, a post he held until 1904. In 1897 he debuted with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Emil Paur, again with the Paderewski concerto. He also concertized in Canada, Mexico and Cuba at this time. In 1895 he married Elsa von Grave (he would later divorce her and marry Henrietta Gremmel in 1921).
Berlin 1904-1914.
In 1904 Jonás decided he would return to Europe, settling in Berlin, where he soon became one of the most respected piano teachers. There he soon became a professor at the Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory and befriended Leopold Godowsky, Karl Klindworth, James Kwast and Moritz Moszkowski, who were also teachers and performers there. World War I caused him to return to New York, where he finally settled.
United States 1914-1943.
From 1914 until his death in 1943, he lived in a New York apartment on the Upper West Side (19 West 85th Street), his apartment becoming a mecca for talented students and pianists from all over the world. Soon, Jonás also became professor at the Combs College of Music in Philadelphia, where he kept a small apartment as well.
"Master School of Modern Piano Playing and Virtuosity".
It is during his period in New York when Jonás had the unprecedented idea of starting a correspondence with all of the great musicians and pianists he had met throughout his life as a wandering musician, asking them personally to collaborate with their own ideas on pianism towards the publication of a treatise on piano playing that would include the main currents in modern virtuosity. The pianists even agreed to write their own technical exercises specifically for Jonás book, as well as sharing their own ideas on technique, pedalling, fingering, practicing methods, phrasing, memorizing, etc., and also taking exclusive photographs of themselves and their hands playing in order to illustrate some points.
In the early 1920s he started putting together all the material he had amassed from the correspondence and began writing what he would later title "Master School of Modern Piano Playing and Virtuosity", in seven volumes. It took him seven years to complete the vast undertaking (1922–1929), which in its final formed featured the unique distinction of having the collaboration of practically all the greatest living piano virtuosi. The final contributors were Arthur Friedheim, Ignaz Friedman, Vasily Safonov, Ferruccio Busoni, Katharine Goodson, Leopold Godowsky, Alfred Cortot, Rudolph Ganz, Wilhelm Backhaus, Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler, Ernő Dohnányi, Ossip Gabrilowitsch, Josef Lhévinne, Isidor Philipp, Moriz Rosenthal, Emil von Sauer, Leopold Schmidt, and Zygmunt Stojowski, and included excerpts from more than one thousand examples drawn from the entire piano literature in order to illustrate specific points.
In breadth of scope, originality, and clearness of execution, the book is unprecedented. It was finally published in 1929 by Carl Fischer Music in New York. Busoni considered it ""the most monumental work ever written on piano playing"" in seven volumes:
Book I: Finger Exercises
Book II: Scales
Book III: Arpeggios
Book IV: Complete School of Double Notes
Book V: Octaves, Staccato, and Chords
Book VI: The Artistic Employment of the Piano Pedals
Book VII: Exercises for Fingers, Wrists, and Arms Away From the Piano, Phrasing, Embellishments in Music
Lhévinne called it ""the greatest and most valuable work on the subject"", and Rosenthal called it a ""Master-Work"" ("meisterarbeit"). It was also admired by Sergei Rachmaninoff, who mentioned it in some of his letters.
Reception.
Due to the impact of the Great Depression and World War II on the publishing industry in America, the "Master School" was never reprinted and quickly went out of print. The author and his ideas became somewhat forgotten after his death, but there are still pianists and teachers who use volumes of the "Master School" in their pedagogy. Even though he is the most important Spanish writer on pianism, he is practically unknown in his native country (where the "Master School" has never been published).
Some of Alberto Jonás's piano students include Pepito Arriola, Ellen Ballon, Anis Fuleihan, Eugenia Buxton, Vincent Persichetti, Eloise Wood, Daniel Jones, Lewis L. Richards, David Earl Moyer, Leonard Heaton, Alfred Lucien Calzi, Elizabeth Zug, Reah Sadowsky, and Louis Loth.

House of Monpezat

The House of Laborde de Monpezat () is a French family, known since the seventeenth century, associated with the Danish Royal Family by marriage. In 1967 Henri de Laborde de Monpezat wed Princess Margrethe of Denmark, heiress presumptive of the ruling House of Glücksburg. In the event of ascension to the Danish throne of their son or male-line descendant, the main branch of the Danish Royal Family will belong patrilineally to the "Laborde de Monpezat" lineage. However, it is unclear which name the royal family will use in this event.
Family background.
The Labordes were a well-to-do family of the middle-class originating from the region of Béarn in southwestern France which took the name "Laborde de Monpezat", following the marriage of Jean Laborde to Catherine d'Arricau, "dame" de Monpezat on 16 August 1648. Letters patent of ennoblement were issued by Louis XIV of France in 1655. But the elevation in status depended legally upon the family's recognition as noble by the province of Béarn, where their lands were located, in the form of registration of the king's decree by the Béarnaise Estates which, in 1703 and again in 1707, rejected the Laborde de Monpezat petition for validation. 
Nonetheless, the family survived the French Revolution under the name of "Monpezat". By Napoleonic decrees, the family's requests to legally change their surname to "de Laborde-Monpezat" (on 14 July 1860) and then to "de Laborde de Monpezat" (on 19 May 1861) were granted. Under the present form of the name, the family supplied a mayor to the town of Pau in 1875; Aristide de Laborde de Monpezat (1830–1888), great grandfather of Prince Henrik.
Sometime late in the nineteenth century, the Laborde de Monpezats assumed the comital style, using it as if it were a "titre de courtoisie" (that is, as an unofficial prefix rather than as a substantive title, e.g. ""comte" André de Laborde de Monpezat" rather than "André de Laborde, "comte" de Monpezat"). Traditionally the royal court and French society accepted such usage by genuinely noble families. However neither the nobility nor hereditary title of the Laborde de Monpezats is acknowledged as historically valid by the "Encyclopédie de la fausse noblesse et de la noblesse d'apparence" (), nor did Régis Valette include the family in his "Catalogue de la noblesse française" (2002). On the other hand, since the title was assumed by Prince Henrik's ancestor prior to the twentieth century, it is possible he was unaware of the misuse until his family's history was scrutinized by genealogists after his engagement. Henrik's 1996 autobiography acknowledges the unsuccessful ennoblement.
Danish titles.
Danish law never officially required that royal spouses be of aristocratic origin. Nonetheless, no prince's marriage to a person who lacked male-line descent from royalty or nobility had been accepted as dynastic by the sovereign in the course of Denmark's history as a hereditary monarchy prior to Hereditary Princess Margrethe's marriage in June 1967. From the date of that marriage "Count" Henri de Laborde de Monpezat was designated "Prince Henrik of Denmark". In 2005, his wife having reigned as Queen Margrethe II since 1972, Henrik was officially declared Denmark's "Prince Consort". 
On 30 April 2008, the title "Count of Monpezat" ("greve af Monpezat"), was conferred by the Queen on both of her sons, and made hereditary for their descendants in the male-line, for both males and females. The Queen's Private Secretary Henning Fode commented, "The Queen and the Prince Consort have considered this for quite some time, and it has led to the belief that it was the right thing to do."
In fact, Henrik had mentioned the possibility of associating his family name with that of his royal descendants as long ago as 1996, stating in his published memoir, "During our generation the future sovereign will perhaps receive approval to see 'Monpezat' added to the dynastic name of Oldenburg-Glücksborg". While being interviewed by the French weekly "Point de Vue" in October 2005, Henrik raised the issue shortly after the birth of Crown Prince Frederick's firstborn child, Prince Christian, who is expected to inherit the Danish crown eventually: "It also makes him very proud and happy that "Monpezat" will be added to this small grandson's future name as Prince of Denmark. 'It is a great joy for me that his French roots will also be remembered.'" Although no announcement was made at that time, Prince Christian does now include (part of) his French grandfather's surname among his hereditary titles. The grant does not extend this Danish title to Henrik himself, however. Nor has the Danish Crown issued a proclamation or statement indicating the name that the royal dynasty will bear after Queen Margrethe's reign (in accordance with tradition, she reigns as a member of her father's dynasty, the House of Glücksburg).
Queen Margrethe and Prince Henrik also acquired a private French residence, the Château de Cayx in Cahors, France, where the Prince Consort, his children and grandchildren can entertain their French relatives and the Queen can dedicate time to her love of painting. Since 1988, she has exhibited in several specialised galleries.
Prince Joachim, and his descendants now bear a coat-of-arms differenced from those of Denmark's royal arms with a Monpezat inescutcheon and princely coronet, although the Crown Prince continues to bear the royal arms differenced with his own coronet.

Sherbakulsky District

Sherbakulsky District () is an administrative and municipal district (raion), one of the thirty-two in Omsk Oblast, Russia. It is located in the southwest of the oblast on the border with Kazakhstan. The area of the district is . Its administrative center is the urban locality (a work settlement) of Sherbakul. Population: 21,342 (2010 Census); The population of Sherbakul accounts for 32.7% of the district's total population.
History.
The territory of what is now Sherbakulsky District was a part of the Kazakh Khanate until 1718, when, after the death of Tauke Khan, the khanate broke apart and Cossack units moving south from Russia occupied the area. In the 1890s, these former Kazakh grazing lands were opened for settlement. In 1893, the first settlement was established at Borisovka by Russian and Ukrainian settlers. In 1895, German settlers established Krasnoyarka, and in 1896—Maksimovka.
Modern Sherbakulsky District was created on October 14, 1924 as part of the Soviet reorganization of the oblast structure under the State Division of Soviet Middle Asian Republics.
Administrative and municipal divisions.
As an administrative division, the district is divided into one work settlement (Sherbakul) and nine rural okrugs (Alexandrovsky, Babezhsky, Borisovsky, Izyumovsky, Krasnoyarsky, Kutuzovsky, Maksimovsky, Slavyansky, and Yekaterinoslavsky) comprising thirty-seven rural localities.
As a municipal division, the district is incorporated as Sherbakulsky Municipal District and divided into one urban settlement (within the borders of the work settlement of Sherbakul) and nine rural settlements (which correspond to the rural okrugs).

The Difference Between Love and Envy is the first EP released by the newly renamed Danger:Radio. It was released fall of 2004.
"The Difference Between Love and Envy" was the first notable recording that the band did. It was released around the time when the band's sounds had started to finally solidify from their rougher sound of before to something that couldn't easily be defined within a single genre. In actuality, the album is made up of six songs, but split into nine tracks in order to more clearly distinguish the intros and outros. 
The EP was sold via Interpunk.com [http://www.interpunk.com/item.cfm?Item=58849&] but is currently (and most likely permanently) out of stock.
Many of the albums were shipped with errors. When reading ID3 tag data on the songs, "Latah" was marked as "Catah", and "Dresses and Sweaters" was marked "Disesses and Sweaters". Also, the album title was marked as "The Difference Between Love and Hate".
Three of the songs on the album ("Movie Scenes", "Destitute" and "Latah") were released as demos by Danger: Radio before the release of the full album.

Foxwoods Casino Philadelphia

Foxwoods Casino Philadelphia was a proposed casino to be located first along the Delaware River, then under pressure from local residents attempted to move to the The Gallery at Market East in Center City in Philadelphia, PA. It was one of five stand-alone casinos awarded a gaming license on December 20, 2006 by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. 
The "Philadelphia Inquirer" states that Stephen Wynn (Graduate and former Trustee of University of Pennsylvania) and Wynn Resorts have signed a non-binding deal to take over the long delayed Foxwoods Casino in Philadelphia. 
On October 26, 2010 it was announced that Harrah's Entertainment (pending signing final agreement) would buy a one-third stake and be in charge of operations in the casino. Harrah's Provided artist rendition of what the project would looking like to the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, that featured Horseshoe as the Casino brand on November 18, 2010. These plans show a two-story, casino located at Columbus Boulevard and Reed Street. The casino will sit back about from Columbus Blvd. Plans include an Asian gaming room, a noodle bar, and a riverfront sports bar under a steakhouse. Parking will be in surface lots with 1,376 spaces. The casino is expected to cost $438-million and will include 1,500 slots and 70 table games. The second phase will include a 2,250-space parking garage located at Columbus Blvd. and Tasker Ave. Harrah's Entertainment failed to meet the deadline and the license was revoked on December 16, 2010.
History.
Originally, it was planned to be located along the Delaware River in South Philadelphia. It was to be built on a site between Tasker and Reed Streets that was to include 3,000 Slot machines, an 1,800 seat showroom, a 4,500 space parking garage, and future expansion to a casino with 5,000 slot machines and a 500-room hotel.
In September 2008, residents opposed to the development forced the developers of the Foxwoods Casino to move proposal to The Gallery at Market East. This proposal was endorsed by both Mayor Michael Nutter and Governor Ed Rendell but was opposed by local residents. The original proposal for the Foxwoods Casino at The Gallery at Market East was for a 3,000 slot machine casino on two floors currently occupied by Burlington Coat Factory, forcing that store to relocate.
On February 26, 2009, it was announced that the developers were looking into locating their new casino onto three floors of the former Strawbridge's flagship store, which is currently vacant and owned by the Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust, the owners of The Gallery.
In April 2009, Comcast exec and Foxwoods investor Ed Snider was forced to return campaign contributions to then-Governor Ed Rendell, which was barred by campaign finance laws.
In June 2009, the Center City site began to unravel in the face of opposition from the owner of the buildings top 15 floors. The difficulties Foxwoods has faced in Philadelphia also highlight the challenges of building an urban casino. Casino companies, for the most part, have avoided such plays in the US, sticking to less controversial rural, suburban or riverboat locations, industry observers say. Casino developers almost always face complaints about traffic and the impact on nearby residential areas wherever they build, but such concerns become particularly intense amid densely packed city neighborhoods.
In February 2010, Steve Wynn was brought in as the managing partner of the project. The location was returned to its original Waterfront site, and Wynn said that there would be no hotel built on the location. Steve Wynn views Philadelphia as a major feeder market to his Las Vegas resort. The casino will be about from the SugarHouse Casino which is also on the riverfront just north of downtown.
Withdrawal.
On April 8, 2010, Wynn announced that his company was withdrawing from the project, three days after presenting plans for the Foxwoods site to the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board.
License Revoked.
On December 16, 2010, the Gaming Control Board voted to revoke the casino's license after the venture failed to secure funding.

Lee, Lucy and Daisy (minus Tim) are desperately trying to think of a way to convince Mr. Namasaki, a Japanese client of Lucy's, that they didn't poison his prize carp. Unexpectedly, Terry Wogan arrives and asks for a donation for Children In Need or else he'll send Pudsey the Bear round to keep and 'eye' on them.
Lee then quickly runs through the audience with the donation bucket and gets the audience to donate. Getting back to Terry, who is slightly disappointed with the donations, asks Lee for a donation. Lee refuses and is about to kick Terry out when Mr. Namasaki arrives and accuses Lee of poisoning his prized carp. He is about to hit Lee with the fish, when Terry interrupts him who then takes the fish from the Namasaki only to hit Lee with the dead carp sending him flying.
Series 7 (2014).
"Not Going Out" will return for a seventh series towards the end of 2014 and will star Lee Mack, Sally Bretton and Katy Wix reprising their roles as Lee, Lucy and Daisy respectively. The series will consist of ten episodes, one of which will be broadcast as a Christmas special in 2014.

Dalgety plc

Dalgety plc was a major British conglomerate. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
History.
The Company was established by Frederick Dalgety, a Scotsman, in Melbourne in 1846, outfitting sheep ranchers.
In December 1842 Frederick Dalgety arrived in Melbourne, which had only recently been established, as manager of a new firm which he soon bought and by 1848 was an independent and well-to-do merchant, concentrating on 'the settlers' trade', providing merchandise for the squatters and buying their produce. He visited England in 1849 to strengthen his facilities for credit and the disposal of colonial produce and returned to Victoria in 1851. In the gold rush Dalgety continued with general business, enlarged his pastoral trade, sold merchandise to the diggers and bought much gold from them; in 1851-55 he made about £150,000 from his gold speculations alone. 
In 1854 Dalgety moved to London to establish the headquarters of a metropolitan-colonial enterprise dealing mainly with the Victorian pastoral industry. He took with him as London partner Frederick Du Croz, and left C. Ibbotson as a colonial manager-partner in Geelong; he returned to Victoria in 1857 to establish James Blackwood as another manager-partner in Melbourne. He lived permanently in England.
In the 1850s Australian stores like Buckley & Nunn in Melbourne imported most of the goods sold in their stores through Dalgety's firms.
In 1884, because of advancing age, the increasing demand for capital and competition from joint-stock companies and banks, he was forced to incorporate his private partnerships as a joint-stock company, called Dalgety & Co Ltd, and registered in London on 29 April 1884. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange. By that time it had operations in London, Melbourne, Geelong, Launceston, Dunedin, Christchurch and Sydney.
In the next three years Dalgety branches were opened in Queensland and Western Australia, and the properties and assets of the company increased by 50 per cent. Dalgety continued in active management as largest shareholder and chairman of directors until his death in 1894. Dalgety & Co. continued to grow after its founder died. In July 1898, the company signed an agreement with the Russian consul in Melbourne for the use of Russian ships to transport wool from Australia to Europe.
Dalgety & Co Ltd merged with the "New Zealand Loan & Mercantile Agency Co. Ltd" in November 1961 to form Dalgety & New Zealand Loan Ltd (UK) (DNZL). On 1 September 1961 Dalgety & Co Ltd was delisted from ASX. With assets of £44 million in 1963 the merged entity was the largest pastoral combine operating in Australasia.
The Company expanded into North America in 1966 acquiring "Balfour Guthrie", a lumber and poultry business, and in 1970 it acquired the UK-based "Pig Improvement Company".
In 1979 it diversified into foods acquiring "Spillers", a flour milling and pet food business, following a hostile take-over battle, and in 1987 it bought "Golden Wonder", potato crisp manufacturers. Then in 1995 it bought "Felix Pet Foods".
In the late 1990s, following a BSE crisis in the UK, it entered into a series of disposals and sold Golden Wonder to the management in 1995, its food ingredients and "Spillers" flour milling operations to Kerry Group plc in 1997 and its pet foods business to Nestlé in 1997. In Australia, in 1993, Dalgety Farmers Ltd became LFD Ltd a wholly owned subsidiary of ANZ Banking Group and Dalgety’s pastoral interests were sold to Wesfarmers.
Demise of the business.
The company was renamed "PIC International Group plc" in 1998 and then "Sygen International plc" in 2001. By that time the main asset left in the company was its investment in "Pig Improvement Company". Genus plc bought what was left of the company in 2005.

United States Senate election in Illinois, 1992

The 1992 United States Senate election in Illinois was held on November 3, 1992. Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Alan J. Dixon decided to run for re-election a third term, but was defeated in the primary against Carol Moseley Braun, who ended up winning the general election.
Democratic Primary.
Analysis.
This defeat shocked observers; at the time no Senator had been defeated in a primary in over a decade and Dixon had a long record of electoral success. He was a moderate Democrat, who recently voted to confirm Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. Braun, a black woman and known reformist liberal, got a large share of black, liberal, and women voters ("The Year of the Woman"). In addition, she carried Cook County, Illinois, by far the most populated county in the state. Another factor was the third candidate in the race, multi-millionaire attorney Al Hofeld. Hofeld drew away some of the moderate and conservative Democrats who normally supported Dixon. He also spent a lot of money running advertisements attacking Dixon, weakening his support.

HMS Arabis (K73)

HMS "Arabis" was a of the Royal Navy. Originally ordered for the French Navy in the early days of the war, the ship was commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS "Arabis". She was transferred to the United States Navy in 1942, serving as USS "Saucy". Returned to the United Kingdom in 1945, she was recommissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS "Snapdragon".
World War II service.
"Arabis" was built at Harland & Wolff, Belfast, as part of the 1939 War Emergency Programme for the Royal Navy. One of the early Flower class corvettes, she was ordered on 19 September 1939, and laid down a month later. She was launched on 14 February 1940 and completed on 5 April 1940.
Royal Navy.
After working up, "Arabis" was assigned to the Western Approaches Escort Force for service as a convoy escort. In this role "Arabis" was engaged in all the duties performed by escort ships; protecting convoys, searching for and attacking U-boats which attacked ships in convoy, and rescuing survivors.
During this period she fought in several convoy battles. In September 1940 "Arabis" was part of the force escorting convoy OB 216, which lost four ships and in October with OB 229 which lost two. The same month she was with the ill-fated HX 79 which lost twelve ships in a matter of hours.
In May 1941 "Arabis" was part of the force escorting HX 126, which lost seven ships sunk, and in June with HX 133 which saw six ships sunk and one U-boat destroyed.
During her two years service in the Battle of the Atlantic "Arabis" escorted 47 Atlantic and 11 Gibraltar convoys, assisting in the safe passage of over 2,000 ships, though some were subsequently lost.
US Navy.
Whilst at Belfast in April 1942 she was transferred to the United States Navy under Reverse Lend Lease, one of ten Flower-class corvettes to be so transferred during 1942. After escorting a convoy to Halifax, Nova Scotia she sailed to Boston for refitting. Following this she escorted ships between Trinidad and Barbados. In September was transferred to the Trinidad-Guantanamo Bay convoy route and in January 1943 was changed again, to the Trinidad-Recife, route. She returned to North Atlantic convoy duties in March 1944 and was decommissioned from the United States Navy at Chatham, England in August 1945.
Post-war service.
Recommissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS "Snapdragon", she was sold in 1946.
Mercantile service.
She worked as the merchant vessel SS "Katina" and in 1950 was renamed SS "Tewfik".

Psymberin

Psymberin is a cytotoxin derived from sea sponges. It was discovered by Phillip Crews, "et al." in 2004. Crews found Psymberin was highly bioactive as it showed LC50s at nanomolar concentrations against various types of tumors.
Biosynthesis.
The biosynthesis of Psymberin became of interest when it was found to have a very similar structure to Pederin, a natural product derived from the "Paederus" genus of beetles. This led researchers to investigate the genes of the organism that code for the respective natural product. A trans-AT polyketide synthase cluster, designated as the "Psy" cluster, contained two large groups of genes coding for two PKSs. The smaller gene group, "psyA", encoded a PKS with three modules, while the larger "psyD" encoded a ten module PKS. This ten module PsyD protein is, to date, the protein with the highest reported number of PKS modules. Large portions of the gene cluster "psyD" have very close counterparts in the pederin gene clusters. This indicates that Psymberin and Pederin are both structurally and biosynthetically related. The figure below shows the proposed biosynthesis of Psymberin based on analysis of the gene clusters. Roman numerals represent which clade each Ketosynthase domain belongs. The domains outlined in red represent carrier proteins.

Hermione, Countess of Ranfurly

Hermione, Countess of Ranfurly, OBE, (née Llewellyn) (13 November 1913 – 11 February 2001), was the British author of "To War With Whitaker: The Wartime Diaries of the Countess of Ranfurly, 1939–1945". Published when Lady Ranfurly was in her eighties, these highly successful diaries were widely admired for their illustration of the writer's courage, pluck and humour.
Childhood.
Hermione Llewellyn was born in Postlip, Gloucestershire into a wealthy family of Welsh origin. She had a handsome older brother, Griffith "Owen" (1912–1933), and two beautiful sisters, Cynthia (born 1916) and Daphne (born 1922); "I started life as a disappointment — because I wasn't a boy", she recalled. "I continued being a disappointment — because I was ugly. Instead of minding, I determined to ride better, run faster, be funnier and give more generous presents than the rest of the family." Their father, Griffith Robert Poyntz Llewellyn, was dashing, popular and extravagant; his lack of caution was to have disastrous consequences, and he lost the family fortune on horses and houses when Hermione was thirteen. "We became poor very quickly", she reported. Their mother Emily "Constance" (née Elwes) was beautiful and loving, but during Hermione's childhood became mentally ill and was diagnosed with manic-depression. The family accompanied her to Switzerland for treatment. There was further family tragedy with Owen's death in an air crash.
She completed her education at Southover Manor School, in Sussex.
Career.
In 1930 and impoverished, a 17-year-old Hermione moved to London to look for a job. As she noted, she was "ill-prepared for life beyond the bounds of a country estate", and had no qualifications except "good English and good manners." It was the height of the Depression, and there were few available openings, but she managed to obtain a job selling gas appliances for the Gas Light and Coke Company. She had scarcely ever been in a kitchen, and had difficulty giving personal advice to customers. Nevertheless, she became a successful saleswoman and wrote that "people seemed to like it when I said: 'Always buy a gas cooker with a large oven, then you can commit suicide with your husband'". Hermione took a secretarial course and subsequently found employment in a War Office typing pool. She remained short of money, and though invited to balls and for weekends at country houses, she had to decline, as she could not afford to buy the necessary clothes.
In 1937, Hermione went to Australia as secretary to Lord Wakehurst who had been appointed as Governor of New South Wales. On a visit to Canberra, she met Daniel Knox, 6th Earl of Ranfurly, who was aide-de-camp to the Australian Governor-General. The day she returned to England, she found Ranfurly seated on the sofa in her London flat, reading the "Sporting Life"; the two immediately became engaged, and were married on 17 January 1939.
World War II.
The Ranfurlys were on a stalking holiday in Scotland when the news came that Germany had invaded Poland. Cutting short their trip, they returned to London, where a telegram awaited them from Dan's Yeomanry regiment, the Sherwood Rangers, telling him to report to duty in Nottinghamshire. Dan turned to their portly cook-butler, Whitaker, and asked if Whitaker was coming too. Hermione recorded that "Whitaker sat there looking fat and rather red, and he said, 'To the war my Lord?' and Dan said 'Yes'. And Whitaker said: 'Very good, my Lord,' as though Dan had asked for a cup of coffee." The exchange was to provide the title of Lady Ranfurly's war diaries, which proved to be an unexpected publishing success in the 1990s.
On their first wedding anniversary, Lord Ranfurly left with the Sherwood Rangers for a posting to the British-controlled Palestine. Regulations barred wives of the Yeomanry from joining their husbands at the front. However, Hermione ignored the rules, and in February 1940 managed to obtain a passage to Egypt from a shady London travel agent, arriving in Palestine two weeks later.
Hermione thought that with her secretarial skills, she would easily find a job in the Middle East. It proved more difficult than expected, and in September 1940 a one-eyed brigadier ordered her forcible repatriation to Britain with other "illegal wives". Determined not to be separated from her husband, she jumped ship from the RMS "Empress of Britain" at Cape Town, and succeeded in obtaining an aeroplane ticket back to Egypt by implying to a travel agent that she was a spy on a secret mission. The "Empress of Britain" was sunk shortly after.
On arrival in Cairo, Lady Ranfurly laid low in the flat of her friends Pamela and Patrick Hore-Ruthven, but gradually her return became known. Her actions infuriated the British military authorities, which made finding a job difficult. However, her secretarial skills were in short supply and she was soon recruited to work for the Special Operations Executive office in Cairo. Despite continued opposition from the Army, who failed in an attempt to have British ambassador Sir Miles Lampson remove her passport, she became the highly efficient secretary to George Pollock, the head of the SOE. At first pleased with her job, she quickly became concerned about the SOE's actions, intentions and dubious security and finances, and considered that the organisation was working "across, if not against, the war effort". In March 1941, she expressed her concerns to the visiting Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and in May to General Wavell, the Commander-in-Chief for the Middle East. Wavell could take no direct action since SOE did not come under the War Office, but sharing her concerns, he asked her to pass on any documents that aroused her suspicion. She achieved this by stealing questionable documents from the office each evening, typing a copy of them and then returning the originals to their positions the next morning. Her subterfuge led directly to a major reorganization of SOE Cairo in the summer of 1941.
In April 1941, Dan Ranfurly was reported missing after the Battle of Tobruk, and Hermione had no knowledge about whether he was living or dead until she received a letter from him five months later. He remained a prisoner of war in Italy for three years, escaping in 1944 following the Italian armistice. In the interim, Lady Ranfurly received special permission to remain in the Middle East from General Wavell, and worked first as a personal assistant to Sir Harold MacMichael, the High Commissioner in Palestine, and later to General Henry Maitland Wilson, the Supreme Allied commander in the Mediterranean. She was renowned for the tenacity of her desire not to return to England, and General Wilson described Hermione as having "outmanoeuvred every general in the Middle East" in order to achieve her goal.
Between 1941 and 1944, Hermione Ranfurly lived in Cairo, Jerusalem, Baghdad and Algiers, and met many of famous names who passed through the region, including Lady Diana Cooper, Antoine de Saint Exupéry, Sir Walter Monckton, Gaston Palewski, and Noël Coward. She shared a house in Baghdad with Freya Stark, took General George S. Patton shopping in Cairo, dined with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in Algiers, and helped fix General Bernard Montgomery's beret, though she did not think much of the "corny Englishman" complaining that he "would drop his macintosh on the floor and then shout at someone to pick it up." She dined with kings: Peter II of Yugoslavia, Farouk of Egypt and the future Paul of Greece. She befriended a number of intelligence and Special Air Service officers, including Orde Wingate, Fitzroy Maclean, David Stirling and Bill Stirling, and was taught to shoot by a mysterious red-faced man called "Abercrombie" so as to be able to do her part against the Germans. By the end of the war, she likely knew more secrets than any other civilian in the area.
Dan Ranfurly was reunited with his wife in Algiers in May 1944, and after a brief trip to England, Hermione resumed her work as secretary to General Wilson in Algiers and Caserta, Italy, while her husband joined Fitzroy Maclean's liaison mission to Yugoslavia. Hermione was well-positioned for more noteworthy encounters: she taught Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt to dance the Boomps-a-Daisy, and received Marshal Josip Broz Tito for tea: "he was short and stocky and dressed to kill" according to the hostess.
In November 1944, Hermione Ranfurly accepted General Wilson's request that she continue as his secretary when he moved to Washington, D.C. to be head of the British Joint Staff Mission. He rescinded his offer at the last moment, leaving Hermione without a job, luggage or reference. With Dan Ranfurly in Rome, she managed to find a job working for Air Marshal John Slessor, first in Naples and later in London, where she celebrated VE Day by emptying five wastepaper baskets of Slessor's "more boring papers" out of the window.
Post war.
At the end of the war, Dan Ranfurly obtained a job in insurance at Lloyd's of London, and later farmed in Buckinghamshire, while Hermione attempted to put her wartime letters and diaries in order while seated on the sitting room floor. The writer Peter Fleming, an old friend, arranged for her to get a contract for their publication; however, Hermione got cold feet, and repaid the advance nine days later. A daughter, Lady Caroline, was born in 1948. On 20 October 1953, Lord Ranfurly was appointed Governor of the Bahamas by Winston Churchill. Hermione took a great interest in all aspects of Bahamian life, and was concerned by the lack of books in libraries and schools. She asked friends to send unwanted volumes, a project that was to become the Ranfurly Library Service in Nassau. The couple also founded a children's home.
When the Ranfurlys returned to the United Kingdom in 1957, Lady Ranfurly extended the Ranfurly Library Service project to other developing countries short on English books; the organization later changed its name to Book Aid International. She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1970 New Year Honours.
Lord Ranfurly died of cancer in 1988, and the Countess continued to work her diaries in Buckinghamshire. Her old friend and neighbour Lord Carrington read her work, and with his help "To War With Whitaker" was published in 1994. The diaries were an immediate success, and one reviewer noted that they offered "a madcap, aristocratic window behind the lines of war". Encouraged by its success, she published a memoir of her childhood, "The Ugly One", in 1998.
Lady Ranfurly enjoyed her old age, noting "you have so many more memories than when you are young". She died at her home in Buckinghamshire on 11 February 2001 at the age of 87.

Marilyn Stowe

Marilyn Stowe (born 1957) is an English solicitor. She has been described by "The Times" as "one of the most formidable and sought-after divorce lawyers in the UK", and described as "one of the country's leading divorce lawyers". She is the senior partner at Stowe Family Law and the resident family law expert on ITV's flagship daytime programme, "This Morning".
Marilyn Stowe was educated at Leeds Girls' High School and the University of Leeds. She founded Stowe Family Law, the UK's largest specialist family law firm, in 1982. The firm has offices in Harrogate, North Yorkshire; Leeds and Wetherby, West Yorkshire; Hale and Wilmslow, Cheshire, and Central London. 
She is a Fellow of the International Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers ("IAML"), a worldwide association of family lawyers who are recognised by their peers as the most experienced and expert family law specialists in their respective countries. She was among the first 35 solicitors, barristers and ex-judges to qualify as a family law arbitrator in February 2012. The family law arbitration scheme operates in England and Wales and was developed by the Institute of Family Law Arbitrators (IFLA). As a result she is also a member of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (CIArb). In 2012 she became a member of the Legal Advisory Group to the Law Commission (England and Wales) regarding matrimonial property. In 2007 she was a member of a Legal Advisory Group that reviewed the rights of cohabiting couples.
She is also known for unearthing the medical evidence that freed Sally Clark, the victim of a famous British miscarriage of justice.
Sally Clark.
In November 1999, Sally Clark was convicted of the murder of two of her sons. Her first son had died suddenly within a few weeks of his birth in 1996. After her second son died in a similar manner, she was arrested in 1998 and tried for the murder of both infants. The convictions were upheld at appeal in October 2000.
Marilyn Stowe volunteered her involvement in the case, providing her services free of charge because she felt that "something was not right". She obtained key medical reports, which showed that one of the babies could have died from natural causes. This evidence had been known to the prosecution's pathologist, Alan Williams, since February 1998, but had not been shared with other medical witnesses, police or lawyers. The Clark family's solicitor described Marilyn Stowe as "the woman who's going to get Sally out of prison".
Sally Clark's convictions were overturned in a second appeal on 29 January 2003. The prosecution's pathologist, Alan Williams, was found guilty of "serious professional misconduct" by the General Medical Council.
Personal life.
Stowe is married to fellow lawyer Grahame Stowe, and has one son. She attributes her decision to embark upon a legal career to her parents: "It was what they wanted for me and it was at a time when women didn’t go into law." 
Publications.
Stowe is the author of three books about life after divorce:
She contributes a monthly family law column to legal trade magazine Solicitors Journal, entitled Family Business. Stowe also writes the popular Marilyn Stowe Family Law & Divorce Blog, which covers a range of family law issues.

Volvat (station)

Volvat is a disused rapid transit station on the Oslo T-bane.
The underground station was located between Majorstuen and Borgen, and opened in 1939. The platform length was only large enough to accommodate two cars. When the Røa Line was upgraded to metro standard on 5 February 1995, it started bypassing Volvat. Finally, as of 7 April 1997 the station was taken out of service when the Kolsås Line trains were extended from two to three cars.
The station was named after the owner of the land nearby, pharmacist Harald Condrad Thaulow (1815-1881, who was the father of noted painter Frits Thaulow). He came from a small village in Denmark; Tavlov and simply reversed the letters in his last name.
Moved underground in 1939 to accommodate the traffic flow in Sørkedalsveien, Volvat was the only station on the Østerås and Kolsås lines that was underground.

Difficile lectu (Mozart)

Difficile lectu, K. 559, is a canon composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The music, in F major, is set for three singers. The words are probably by Mozart himself. 
The work was entered by the composer into his personal catalog on 2 September 1788 as part of a set of ten canons; it was probably written some time during the years 1786-1787.
Text.
Although some of the canons in the 1788 set have serious (that is, religious) lyrics, K. 559 was evidently meant entirely for fun. The work features two bilingual puns and some scatological humor. The lyrics are—ostensibly—in Latin, though as they are given in sequence they do not make sense in this language:
The humor of the work consists of hearing these words instead as vulgar phrases of German and Italian.
The German pun is based on the strong Bavarian accent of the tenor-baritone Johann Nepomuk Peyerl (1761–1800), who can be presumed to have been the lead singer in the first performance (see below). As Jean-Victor Hocquard points out, the pseudo-Latin lyrics "lectu mihi mars", as Peyerl would have sung them, resemble Bavarian German "leck du mi im Arsch", which in a literal English rendering is "lick thou me in-the arse". More idiomatically, the phrase could be translated, "kiss my arse" (American English "kiss my ass").
The second pun in the canon is based on the single Latin word "jonicu". Winternitz (1958) explains that when this word is sung repeatedly and rapidly, as in the canon, its syllables are liable to be heard rearranged as a taboo word of Italian, "cujoni", which means "balls, testicles", akin to Spanish "cojones".
Michael Quinn writes, "Mozart clearly relished the incongruity resulting from ribald verse set as a canon, traditionally regarded as the most learned of all compositional techniques."
First performance.
A tale concerning how the canon was composed and first sung was offered by Gottfried Weber, a musicologist and editor of the early 19th century.
In an 1824 issue of "Caecilia", the journal he edited, Weber published a facsimile of the original manuscript of the canon (see below). In his commentary, Weber included the following.
Weber does not say where his story came from.
For more on Mozart's habit of favoring his friends with vulgar mockery, see Joseph Leutgeb.
Autograph.
The autograph (original manuscript copy) has survived; it is a "tiny slip of paper" (Searle) on the reverse side of which is —as Weber noted— the original copy of K. 560a. In a number of places the lyrics are blurry and difficult to read, a condition Weber attributed to stray droplets of champagne.
The manuscript was at one time in the collection of Stefan Zweig, and in 1986 was given along with the rest of the collection to the British Library, where it currently resides.
A sketch for K. 559 is also preserved; its existence suggests that, contrary to what Weber recounted, Mozart must have planned his joke in advance. Both the autograph and the sketch can be viewed at the NMA website; see External Links below.
Reception.
The canon is probably one of the less frequently performed of Mozart's works. It illustrates the composer's multilingualism and his taste for light-hearted scatological humor.

Cinema Prague

Cinema Prague are an Australian funk metal band, formed in Perth in 1986. 
Cinema Prague are a band who's combination of humour, funk, thrash and Zappa-esque arrangements made them one of the most entertaining and musically dexterous bands to ever come from Perth. Although the band never reached the international fame of some of their contemporaries, such as Jebediah or Beaverloop, they remain one of the more revered bands in Western Australian musical history and are regularly cited by younger bands as an influence.
Biography.
Initially formed as a four piece in 1986, when some of the members were still at high school, the band had little success to start with. Kailis went to South Perth Primary School, whilst Lowe and Horan went to Attadale Primary School. Horan went on to Perth Modern School participating in their music programme, whilst Lowe and Kailis attended Applecross Senior High School. 
By early 1988, after some member and name shuffling, the three-piece band, Cinema Prague came into existence. In 1990 the band undertook their first tour of the eastern states of Australia. Their debut recording was a cassette-single with the songs "Mushroom Cloud" and "Walking Song", released in November, 1991. It was followed much later by their debut album, "Meldatype", which was recorded between 1992 and 1994 and released in March, 1995. The band's next release was a five track EP, "¡Zasph!" which was released in November, 1996. Cinema Prague's third album, "Nordensort", was released in May, 1998 although it was actually recorded in June/July 1995.
In 1997, after returning from Perth following their 'Idiots Crusade' tour of Europe and South Africa they recorded three tracks "We are the Moo Moo", "The Curse of the Shiny Head" and "Bacon and Eggs Part Two" at Poons Head Studio. The band's fourth album "It's Schnapster", although recorded in 1990, was released in December, 1998 whilst the band was in hiatus. Horan having headed to Britain, where he still performs as well as runs musical workshops for under-age offenders in prisons.
Kailis and Lowe played together in various projects, including Rice. They also undertook further studies, with Lowe studying engineering and Kailis studying architecture.
In 2007 they re-formed for a show with a new bassist Roy Martinez (Dave Mann Collective) and a plan was hatched to release the old recordings as part of a new album, "Snakes Alive", the band's first in over eight years.
"Snakes Alive" was released on 30 January 2009. In an interview at the time, Kailis indicated that the band was planning to work on the new album. In support of the album's release the band gave a number of performances in Perth and Melbourne in early 2009.

Johann Nepomuk Beck

Johann Nepomuk Beck (5 May 1827 – 9 April 1904) was a Hungarian operatic baritone. He possessed a flexible and strong voice that was particularly suited to the French and Italian operatic repertoire. Beginning in 1853, he sang for more than thirty years at the Hofoper (now the Vienna State Opera), particularly excelling in works by Giacomo Meyerbeer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Giuseppe Verdi. He notably portrayed the role of King Solomon in the world première of Karl Goldmark’s "Die Königin von Saba" in 1875.
Biography.
Born at Budapest, Beck first trained as a theology student there but was an active member of the choral society. During a touring season at Budapest from the Vienna Hofoper in about 1847, he sought advice over his 'splendid baritone' voice from the bass Karl Formes and tenor Josef Erl. Formes coached him in the role of Riccardo in "I puritani" and performed the opera with him in the same season. He then studied singing in Vienna and made his professional opera début as the Speaker in Mozart's "Die Zauberflöte" at the Hofoper in 1851. He spent the next two years in short commitments at the opera houses in Hamburg, Bremen, Cologne, Düsseldorf, Mainz, Würzburg and Wiesbaden. He also sang in several operas in Frankfurt including Friedrich of Telramund in "Lohengrin" (1852) and in the German premiere of Ambroise Thomas's "Le songe d'une nuit d'été" (1853).
In 1853, Beck was hired as a member of the company at the Hofoper where he sang roles for more than the next three decades. He notably performed the title role in Mozart's "Don Giovanni" for the opening of the new opera house in 1869. He also sang the role of Hans Sachs in Vienna's first performance of Wagner's "Die Meistersinger" in 1870 and the role of King Solomon in the world première of Karl Goldmark’s "Die Königin von Saba" in 1875. His other opera roles included Pizarro in Beethoven's "Fidelio", Alfonso in Donizetti's "Lucrezia Borgia", the tile role in Donizetti's "Belisario", Nélusko in Meyerbeer's "L’Africaine", Tsar Peter in Meyerbeer's "L'étoile du nord", Count Almaviva in Mozart's "Le nozze di Figaro", the title role in Rossini's "William Tell", King Froila in Franz Schubert's "Alfonso und Estrella", Don Carlo in Verdi's "Ernani", and the title role in Verdi's "Rigoletto" among others. His last opera performance was as Mikéli in Luigi Cherubini's "Les deux journées" in 1885.
In the late 1880s, Beck began to show signs of mental instability and was hospitalized in a mental institution in Inzersdorf. He was eventually released in the early 1890s into the care of his son, Joseph Beck, who gave up a successful opera career to look after his father. They lived together happily first in Vienna and then in Pressburg (modern Bratislava) until Joseph became ill and died in 1903. Johann died the following year.

The Balkan Girls

"The Balkan Girls" is a song by Romanian artist Elena Gheorghe and was the Romanian entry in the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest. The song was selected in the Romanian national final "Selecţia Naţională 2009", which Gheorghe won.
The song was performed at the first semi-final of the contest on 12 May 2009 and went through to the final on 16 May 2009, where it finished 19th with 40 points.
Background.
The song was written by Laurenitu Duta, along with Ovidiu Bistriceanu, Alexandru Pelin and Daris Mangal, in the fall of 2008, and it was Elena Gheorghe's entry at the 2009 Selectia Nationala. "The Balkan Girls" passed the pre-selection and the semi-final. On January 31, 2009, in a live show, it was decided that Gheorghe won the National Final and she will be the next Romanian contestant for Eurovision Song Contest. There are two different versions of this song; The first one was presented in the Romanian final, the second one premiered once with the physical release of the single, on March 10, 2010.
Critical reception.
Most of the Romanian critics said that "The Balkan Girls" is an interesting song and Elena's voice is also good, but it doesn't fit with their preferences for the Eurovision Song Contest. Also, some show-mans from Antena 1 said that the lyrics aren't any good, and that the idea of "Balkan Girls as Party Girls" isn't that good for ESC. After Gheorghe's show in Moscow, many Romanian journalists criticized her. Also, the UK newspaper "The Sun" published on the internet that Gheorghe wasn't singing on the stage, but Lucia Dumitrescu, the backing vocals.
Chart performance.
"The Balkan Girls" entered the Romanian Top 100 on March 22, 2009 at number 57. The second week it reached the top 40; The next weeks the song got closer and closer to the number one, becoming the first ESC entry to peak #1, on April 19, 2009. It has spent two weeks at number-one, leaving top 10 in June. The song left the chart in early August, 2009.
Music videos.
There are two music videos for "The Balkan Girls." The first one was released in early January 2009 as a promotional video for the National Selection. The video was shot in a studio of TVR 1. In this video, Gheorghe appears in a pink dress, dancing along with her back-up dancers.
The second music video was shot in March, in Călăraşi, Romania and in a night club from Bucharest. It premiered on March 15, 2009. In this video Gheorghe's style is drastically changed from the one from the first video, wearing more make-up. In the intro, Elena is appearing, ridding alongside two of her back-up dancers. For the chorus, she jumps from an old bridge into a river. In the next scene Gheorghe appears dancing in a club, with other people. As of the lyric "I'll find a boy for a kiss" a young man is introduced to us. The guy is ignored by all of the girls attending the party in that club. In the end, Gheorghe is wearing a Cheetah Coat and is lying on a sofa in that club.
The video was on the shortlist for the "Best Video" award at Romanian Music Awards 2009 and is one of the most watched ESC videos of 2009, on YouTube.
Promotion.
Gheorghe started a promo tour for Eurovision, in order to promote the song. She cancelled three shows, in Moldova, Greece and Turkey, for unknown reasons. She was present in Berlin, Germany, Amsterdam, Netherlands and she sung "The Balkan Girls" on the Preview party in London. She has also sung the song live on several Romanian TV channels, including TVR 1, Prima TV, Pro TV and Antena 1. Kanal D, a Romanian-Turkish TV channel organised a special event entitled "Elena vs Hadise", in order to promote The Balkan Girls and Dum Tek Tek.

Suspension from the UK parliament

In the Parliament of the United Kingdom, Members of Parliament (MPs) can be suspended from sitting in the House of Commons by the Speaker for "disorderly conduct".
The Speaker can order that an MP is removed from the house until the end of the day, but more often "names" an MP.
When an MP is named, a vote is held in the house in the same way as a normal vote on legislation. If the vote is successful, the MP named is suspended for five days for a first offence and 20 days for a second offence, during which time they cannot take part in votes and debates in Parliament. They also have their pay suspended.
Members of the House of Lords can also be suspended. This occurred for the first time since 1642
in May 2009, when Labour peers Lord Truscott and Lord Taylor of Blackburn were suspended after a newspaper accused them of offering to change laws for cash.
It was followed by the suspension of three more peers in October 2010, when Baronness Udin, Lord Paul and Lord Bhatia were suspended following the Parliamentary expenses scandal.

OCCSA founded a spectrum of agencies which still exist: Rural Community Transportation, Northern Communities Investment Corporation, and Gillman Housing, among others.
The successor NEKCA agency was established in 1980.
Controversies.
The original executive director of OCCSA had political difficulties with the then governor of Vermont, Richard Snelling, who had been born out-of-state. The director described the governor to a newspaper reporter as a "porky ." The agency was subsequently dismantled and the director moved to a western state.
When NEKCA attempted to rezone a St. Johnsbury building for transitional housing for parolees, neighbors objected, as did the local paper. Attempting to reverse the rezoning, 13 litigants took them to Environmental Court in 2007. The petition of the litigants was denied in 2009.
When they discovered that Newport police were recording conversations between NEKCA victim advocates and victims, four advocates resigned, two dismissed, for going public with the information.

Sune Jonsson

Olov Sune Jonsson (December 20, 1930 – January 30, 2009) was a Swedish documentary photographer and writer. 
Jonsson was born in Nyåker outside Nordmaling in the province of Västerbotten, Sweden. After studying folklore and literature in Stockholm and Uppsala, Jonsson returned in the early 1960s to northern Sweden. His debut book "Byn med det blå huset" (The village with the blue house) was published in 1959 and includes personal portrays of people in Djupsjönäs and his native village Nyåker. As in his second photobook, "Timotejvägen", the relationship between text and image play an important role. 
Between 1961 and 1995, Jonsson was hired as a photographer at the Museum of Västerbotten in Umeå, where he became dedicated to long-term cultural photographic works, mainly in the province of Västerbotten. Thematically, his photography was focused on the rural population, farmers, the man-made landscape and religious gatherings. Jonsson's artistic visual production was inspired by internationally known photographers such as August Sander, Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Wayne Miller and Edward Steichen, notably in the photo exhibition "The Family of Man" in 1955. Swedish writer Ivar Lo-Johansson and his social work "Den sociala fotobildboken" was an important role model.
In addition to his photographic work, Jonsson was a skilled documentary film maker and he produced, in cooperation with the Museum of Västerbotten and Swedish television, documentary films about small farms, mining and fishing in the sparsely populated northern Sweden.

Explanatory model

An explanatory model is a useful description and explanation of why and how a thing works or an explanation of why a phenomenon is the way it is.
Explanatory models do not claim to be a complete description/explanation of the absolute reality about the thing/phenomenon, nor does it even claim to, necessarily, be fully accurate. The description/explanation does, however, need to fit well enough to a sufficient portion of all the knowledge, observations and theoretical circumstances known about the thing/phenomenon, so that the explanatory model becomes useful.
That is: the description/explanation of an explanatory model, should be useful/helpful when one is about to make a decision or choice or when trying to understand, explain or in some other way relate to the reality of the world around us.
By being mindful of the difference between on the one hand: "absolute reality" and on the other hand: "explanatory models", then one will be better equipped to avoid erroneously rejecting important new knowledge, even when this new knowledge clearly contradicts that which one knows from before.

Bread and butter pudding is a traditional dessert popular in British cuisine. It is made by layering slices of buttered bread scattered with raisins in an oven dish into which an egg and milk (or cream) mixture, commonly seasoned with nutmeg (and sometimes vanilla or other spices), is poured.
History.
The earliest bread and butter puddings were called "whitepot" and used either bone marrow or butter. Whitepots could also be made using rice instead of bread, giving rise to the rice pudding in British cuisine. One of the earliest published recipes for a bread and butter pudding is found in John Nott's "Cook's and Confectioner's Dictionary" of 1723.

<doc id="21345189" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21345189" title="Vladivostok">
Vladivostok

Vladivostok (, lit. "ruler of the East") is a city and the administrative center of Primorsky Krai, Russia, located at the head of the Golden Horn Bay, not far from Russia's borders with China and North Korea. The population of the city, according to the 2010 Census, is 592,034, down from 594,701 recorded in the 2002 Census. The city is the home port of the Russian Pacific Fleet and the largest Russian port on the Pacific Ocean.
Names.
The name Vladivostok loosely translates from Russian as "the ruler of the East"—a name similar to "Vladikavkaz" which means "the ruler of the Caucasus". In Chinese, the city was known since the Qing Dynasty as Hǎishēnwǎi (海參崴, meaning "sea cucumber cliffs"). In modern day China, it is known by the transliteration "Fúlādíwòsītuōkè" (符拉迪沃斯托克), although its historical Chinese name "Hǎishēnwǎi" is still often used. The Japanese name of the city is "Urajiosutoku" (ウラジオストク; a rough transliteration of the Russian originally written in Kanji as 浦塩斯徳 and often shortened to "Urajio"; ウラジオ; 浦塩). In Korean, the name is transliterated as "Beulladiboseutokeu" (블라디보스토크) in South Korea, "Ullajibosŭttokhŭ" (울라지보스또크) in North Korea, and "Beullajiboseu-ttokeu" (블라지보스또크) by Koreans in China.
Geography.
The city is located in the southern extremity of Muravyov-Amursky Peninsula, which is about long and approximately wide.
The highest point is Mount Kholodilnik, the height of which is . Eagle's Nest Hill is often called the highest point of the city; however, with the height of only , or according to other sources, it is the highest point of the downtown area, but not of the whole city.
History.
The aboriginals of the territory on which modern Vladivostok is located are the Udege minority, and a sub-minority called the Taz which emerged through members of the indigenous Udege mixing with the nearby Chinese and Hezhe. The region had been part of many states, such as the Mohe, Balhae, Jīn Dynasty, Yuan Dynasty, and various other Chinese dynasties, before Russia acquired the entire Maritime Province and the island of Sakhalin by the Treaty of Beijing (1860). Qing China, which had just lost the Opium War with Britain, was unable to defend the region. The Pacific coast near "Hǎishēnwǎi" was settled mainly by the Chinese and Manchus during the Qing Dynasty period. A French whaler visiting the Golden Horn Bay in 1852 discovered Chinese or Manchu village fishermen on its shore. The Manchus banned Han Chinese from most of Manchuria including the "Hǎishēnwǎi" area—it was only visited by illegal gatherers of sea cucumbers.
On June 20 (July 2 Gregorian style), 1860, the military supply ship "Manchur", under the command of Captain-Lieutenant Alexey K. Shefner, called at the Golden Horn Bay to found an outpost called Vladivostok. Warrant officer Nikolay Komarov with 28 soldiers and two non-commissioned officers under his command were brought from Nikolayevsk-on-Amur by ship to construct the first buildings of the future city.
The Manza War in 1868 was the first attempt by Russia to expel Chinese from territory it controlled. Hostilities broke out around Vladivostok when the Russians tried to shut off gold mining operations and expel Chinese workers there. The Chinese resisted a Russian attempt to take Ashold Island and in response, two Russian military stations and three Russian towns were attacked by the Chinese, and the Russians failed to oust the Chinese.
An elaborate system of fortifications was erected between the 1870s and 1890s. A telegraph line from Vladivostok to Shanghai and Nagasaki was opened in 1871, the year when a commercial port was relocated here from Nikolayevsk-on-Amur. Town status was granted on April 22, 1880. A coat of arms, representing the Siberian tiger, was adopted in March 1883.
The first high school was opened in 1899. The city's economy was given a boost in 1916, with the completion of the Trans-Siberian Railway, which connected Vladivostok to Moscow and Europe. 
In the wake of the October Revolution, Vladivostok was of great military importance for the Far Eastern Republic, the Provisional Priamurye Government, and the Allied intervention, consisting of foreign troops from Czechoslovakia, Japan, the United States, British, Canada, and other nations. 
The Czechoslovak Legion conquered the city in 1918 and waited for foreign reinforcements. The Japanese forces arrived in April 1918, followed by British soldiers in May, Americans in June, and later other French and Canadian soldiers. They found in Siberia an open warfare going on between the Bolsheviks on one side and the Czechoslovak Legions and White Russians on the other. Czechoslovak Legion (around 67,000 soldiers), exhausted by their long trek across Siberia and eager to return to their new nation, returned via port of Vladivostok to Czechoslovakia. All allied forces were evacuated by 1920, apart from the Japanese who stayed until 1922.
1,600 Chinese troops also intervened in response to a request by the Chinese community in the area for aid. The taking of the city by Ieronim Uborevich's Red Army on October 25, 1922 marked the end of the Russian Civil War.
As the main naval base of the Soviet Pacific Fleet, Vladivostok was officially closed to foreigners during the Soviet years. The city hosted the summit at which Leonid Brezhnev and Gerald Ford conducted the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in 1974. At the time, the two countries decided quantitative limits on various nuclear weapons systems and banned the construction of new land-based ICBM launchers.
In 2012, Vladivostok hosted the 24th APEC summit. Leaders from the APEC member countries met at Russky Island, off the coast of Vladivostok. With the summit on Russky Island, the government and private businesses inaugurated resorts, dinner and entertainment facilities, in addition to the renovation and upgrading of Vladivostok International Airport. Two giant cable-stayed bridges were built in preparation for the summit, namely the Zolotoy Rog bridge over the Zolotoy Rog Bay in the center of the city, and the Russky Island Bridge from the mainland to Russky Island (it is the longest cable-stayed bridge in the world right now). The new campus of Far Eastern Federal University will be completed on Russky Island by 2012.
Politics.
Head of the city of Vladivostok on the principles of unity of command directs the administration of the city of Vladivostok in accordance with federal laws, the laws of the Primorsky Krai and the charter of the city. The structure of the city administration said City Council by the head. The structure of the administration of the city of Vladivostok may include the territorial bodies of administration of the city of Vladivostok.
The responsibilities of the administration of the city of Vladivostok are:
Legislative authority is vested in the City Council. The new City Council began operations in 2001. June 21 deputies of the Duma of the first convocation of Vladivostok started work. On 17 December 2007 Duma of the third convocation began. The deputies consists of 35 elected emmbers, including 18 members were chosen by a single constituency, and 17 deputies from single-mandate constituencies.
Administrative and municipal status.
Vladivostok is the administrative center of the krai. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with five rural localities, incorporated as Vladivostok City Under Krai Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Vladivostok City Under Krai Jurisdiction is incorporated as Vladivostoksky Urban Okrug.
Climate.
Vladivostok has a monsoon influenced humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification "Dwb") with warm, humid and rainy summers and cold, dry winters. Owing to the influence of the Siberian High, winters are far colder than a latitude of 43 degrees north should warrant given its low elevation and coastal location, with a January average of . In winter, temperatures can drop below while mild spells of weather can raise daytime temperatures above freezing. The average precipitation, mainly in the form of snow, is around from December to March. Snowfall is common during the winter months, but individual snowfalls are light, with a maximum snow depth of only in January. During the winter months, clear and sunny days are common.
Summers are warm, humid and rainy, due to the East Asian monsoon. The warmest month is August, with an average temperature of . Most of the precipitation that Vladivostok receives falls during the summer months and with many days receiving precipitation. Cloudy days are fairly common and with the presence of rainfall, humidity is high, reaching up to 90% in July and August. Overall, Vladivostok receives per year but this can vary. The wettest month was August 1943 when of precipitation fell while the wettest year was in 1974 with of precipitation. On the other end, the months December to March have no precipitation at all in some years and the driest year was 1990 with only . Extremes range from in January 1931 to in July 1939.
Economy.
The city's main industries are shipping, commercial fishing, and the naval base. Fishing accounts for almost four-fifths of Vladivostok's commercial production. Other food production totals 11%.
A very important employer and a major source of revenue for the city's inhabitants is the import of Japanese cars. Besides salesmen, the industry employs repairmen, fitters, import clerks as well as shipping and railway companies. The Vladivostok dealers sell 250,000 cars a year, with 200,000 going to other parts of Russia. Every third worker in the Primorsky Krai has some relation to the automobile import business. In recent years, the Russian government has made attempts to improve the country's own car industry. This has included raising tariffs for imported cars, which has put the car import business in Vladivostok in difficulties. To compensate, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin ordered the car manufacturing company Sollers to move one of its factories from Moscow to Vladivostok. The move was completed in 2009, and the factory now employs about 700 locals. It is planned to produce 13,200 cars in Vladivostok in 2010.
Transportation.
Vladivostok is the starting point of Ussuri Highway (M60) to Khabarovsk, the easternmost part of Trans-Siberian Highway that goes all the way to Moscow and Saint Petersburg via Novosibirsk. The other main highways go east to Nakhodka and south to Khasan.
The Trans-Siberian Railway was built to connect European Russia with Vladivostok, Russia's most important Pacific Ocean port. Finished in 1905, the rail line ran from Moscow to Vladivostok via several of Russia's main cities. Part of the railroad, known as the Chinese Eastern Line, crossed over into Manchuria, China, passing through Harbin, a major city in Manchuria. During the Soviet era, Vladivostok's status as a closed city meant that ferry-passenger tourists arriving from Japan to travel the Trans-Siberian railway westbound had to embark in Nakhodka. Today, Vladivostok serves as the main starting point for the Trans-Siberian portion of the Eurasian Land Bridge.
Air routes connect Vladivostok International Airport with
Japan, China, South Korea, North Korea and Vietnam.
It is possible to get to Vladivostok from several of the larger cities in Russia. Regular flights to Seattle, Washington, were available in the 1990s but have been canceled since. Vladivostok Air resumed flying to Anchorage, Alaska, in July 2008.
Urban transportation.
On June 28, 1908, Vladivostok's first tram line was started along Svetlanskaya Street, running from the railway station on Lugovaya Street. On October 9, 1912, the first wooden cars manufactured in Belgium entered service. Today, Vladivostok's means of public transportation include trolleybus, bus, tram, train, funicular, ferryboat and cutter. The main urban traffic lines are City Center—Vtoraya Rechka, City Center—Pervaya Rechka—3ya Rabochaya—Balyayeva, and City Center—Lugovaya Street.
In 2012, Vladivostok hosted the 24th Summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. In preparation for the event, the infrastructure of the city was renovated and improved. Two giant cable-stayed bridges were constructed in Vladivostok, namely the Zolotoy Rog Bridge over the Golden Horn Bay in the center of the city, and the Russky Bridge from the mainland to Russky Island, where the summit took place. The latter bridge is the longest cable-stayed bridge in the world.
Port.
Founded as a military outpost by Russia in 1860, the Port of Vladivostok's geographic location made it an important strategic base for Russia's Navy. In 1872 the Port of Vladivostok began to grow when the country's main naval base was located there.
The Port of Vladivostok is the eastern last stop on Russia's Northern Sea Route that stretches from the country's northwestern shores at the border of Norway. It is the principal base for supplies for Russia's Arctic ports to the east of Cape Chelyuskin.
The arrival of the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1903 connected the Port of Vladivostok to Manchuria and gave the port a better connection to the rest of the Russian Empire and enhanced its importance as a major center in eastern Russia. The Port of Vladivostok was important as a military port that received supplies from the United States during World War I.
When the Russian Revolution of 1917 began, the Port of Vladivostok was occupied by foreign forces, primarily the Japanese, who stayed there until the early 1920s. After they left the city, the Port of Vladivostok became important to the new Soviet Government.
The Port of Vladivostok continued to be the home of Russia's Pacific Fleet after the USSR took control. It grew considerably after World War II as a military base, and the Port of Vladivostok was closed to foreign shipping between 1952 and the and 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed.
After the fall of Communism in Russia, the Port of Vladivostok emerged as a commercial port with links to other eastern Russian ports as well as countries of the Far East. It began to import consumer goods from Japan, China, and other nations.
The port is ice-free all year round, and in 2002 had a foreign trade turnover worth $275 million.
Education.
Vladivostok is home to numerous educational institutions, including five universities:
The Presidium of the Far Eastern Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences (ДВО РАН) as well as ten of its research institutes are also located in Vladivostok, as is the Pacific Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography ( or ).
Media.
Over fifty newspapers and regional editions to Moscow publications are issued in Vladivostok. The largest newspaper of the Primorsky Krai and the whole Russian Far East is "Vladivostok" with a circulation of 124,000 copies at the beginning of 1996. Its founder, joint-stock company Vladivostok-News, also issues a weekly English-language newspaper "Vladivostok News". Another source of information on the city is the online daily Vladivostok Times. The subjects of the publications issued in these newspapers vary from information around Vladivostok and Primorye to major international events. Newspaper "Zolotoy Rog" ("Golden Horn") gives every detail of economic news. Entertainment materials and cultural news constitute a larger part of Novosti (News) newspaper which is the most popular among Primorye's young people. Also, new online mass media about Russian Far East for foreigners Far East Times. This source invites everyone to take part in informational support of RFE for visitors, travellers and businessmen.
Vladivostok operates many online media - newsvl, primamedia, primorye24, VladTop - Breaking News Vladivostok
As of 1999, there are also seven radio stations, the most popular being 24-hour VBC (612 kHz, 101.7 MHz) and Europa+ (738 kHz, 104.2 MHz). Europa+ normally broadcasts popular modern British-American music, while the ratio of Russian and foreign songs over VBC is fifty-fifty. Every hour one can hear local news over these radio stations. Radio Vladivostok (1098 kHz) operates from 06:00 till 01:00. It broadcasts several special programs which are devoted to the music of the 1950s-1980s as well as New Age.
Russian rock band Mumiy Troll hails from Vladivostok and frequently puts on shows there. In addition, the city played host to the now-legendary "VladiROCKstok" International Music Festival in September 1996. Hosted by the Mayor and Governor, and organized by two young American expatriates, the festival drew nearly 10,000 people and top-tier musical acts from St. Petersburg (Akvarium and DDT) and Seattle (Supersuckers, Goodness), as well as several leading local bands. 
It is the nearest city to the massive Sikhote-Alin Meteorite, which fell on February 12, 1947, in the Sikhote-Alin Mountains, approximately northeast of Vladivostok.
Culture.
Theater.
Maxim Gorky Academic Theater, named after Russian author, Maxim Gorky, was founded in 1931 and is used for drama, musical and children's theater performances.
In September 2012, a granite statue of actor Yul Brynner (1920-1985) was inaugurated in Yul Brynner Park, directly in front of the house where he was born at 15 Aleutskaya St.
Museums.
The Arsenyev Primorye Museum (), opened in 1890, is the main museum of the Primorsky Krai. Besides the main facility, it has three branches in Vladivostok itself (including Arsenyev's Memorial House), and five branches elsewhere in the krai. Among the items in the museum's collection are the famous 15th-century Yongning Temple Steles from the lower Amur.
There is a beautiful new opera and ballet theatre.
Pollution.
Local ecologists from the "Ecocenter" organization have claimed that much of Vladivostok's suburbs are polluted and that living in them can be classified as a health hazard. The pollution has a number of causes, according to "Ecocenter" geo-chemical expert Sergey Shlykov. Vladivostok has about eighty industrial sites, which may not be many compared to Russia's most industrialized areas, but those around the city are particularly environmentally unfriendly, such as shipbuilding and repairing, power stations, printing, fur farming and mining. In addition, Vladivostok has a particularly vulnerable geography which compounds the effect of the pollution. Winds cannot clear pollution from some of the most densely populated areas around the Pervaya and Vtoraya Rechka as they sit in basins which the winds blow over. In addition, there is little snow in winter and no leaves or grass to catch the dust to make it settle down.
Sports.
Vladivostok is home to the football club FC Luch-Energiya Vladivostok, who plays in the Russian First Division, ice hockey club Admiral Vladivostok from the Kontinental Hockey League's Chernyshev Division, and basketball club Spartak Primorye, who plays in the Russian Basketball Super League.
International relations.
Twin towns and sister cities.
Vladivostok is twinned with:

Marienau Charterhouse

Marienau Charterhouse ("Kartause Marienau") is a Carthusian monastery, or charterhouse, the successor to the Maria Hain Charterhouse in Düsseldorf, located since 1964 near Bad Wurzach, district of Ravensburg in Baden-Württemberg. It is the only extant Carthusian monastery in Germany.
Maria Hain.
The former Schloss Hain in Düsseldorf-Unterrath was established under the name of Kartause Maria Hain (Maria Hain Charterhouse) as a Carthusian monastery in 1869, where despite the threats of the "Kulturkampf" in the 1880s and of World War II, it survived until 1964, when the site was required for the expansion of Düsseldorf Airport and the monks were forced to leave.
Marienau.
Marienau Charterhouse was established in 1964 in Talacker near Bad Wurzach, Baden-Württemberg, as a replacement for Maria Hain. Its secluded woodland location acts to keep it apart from the world, and the monastery is not open to general visitors.
It was built between 1962 and 1964 to designs by the architects Emil Steffann and Gisberth M. Hülsmann.
Marienau is a "double charterhouse", that is, it has hermitages for 24 monks, rather than the usual 12. The buildings, as specifically required by the Carthusian order through Pater Marianus Marck, fall into five clearly defined areas:
The buildings round the great cloister are single-storied, while the remainder are two-storied. All are of simple brick construction with ceilings of wooden beams and red tiled roofs. The outside walls are painted yellow. The perimeter wall encloses the entire precinct, with a height of some 2.5 metres and a total length of about 1.2 kilometres, with three gates.
At the centre point of the enclosed area, amounting to about 10 hectares, is the simple church. Enclosed within the monastery complex is the graveyard. Carthusians are traditionally buried in their robes without a coffin, on a board; the only monument is a simple wooden cross without a name. The graveyard also contains a large wooden cross under which are buried the bones of the dead from Maria Hain, which were moved to the new charterhouse in 1964 with the rest of the community.

Phorm

Phorm, formerly known as 121Media, is a digital technology company known for its contextual advertising software. Phorm is incorporated in Delaware but announced plans to incorporate in Singapore in 2012. Founded in 2002, the company originally distributed programs that were considered spyware, from which they made millions of dollars in revenue. It has since stopped distributing those programs after complaints from groups in the United States and Canada, and announced it was talking with several United Kingdom Internet service providers (ISPs) to deliver targeted advertising based on the websites that users visit. Phorm currently partners with ISPs Oi, Telefonica in Brazil, Romtelecom in Romania, and TTNet in Turkey. In June 2012, Phorm announced that it would raise £20m for a 20% stake in its Chinese subsidiary.
The company's proposed advertising system, called Webwise, is a behavioral targeting service (similar to NebuAd) that uses deep packet inspection to examine traffic. Phorm says the data collected will be anonymous and will not be used to identify users, and that their service would even include protection against phishing (fraudulent collection of users' personal information). Nonetheless, World Wide Web creator Sir Tim Berners-Lee and others have spoken out against Phorm for tracking users' browsing habits, and the ISP BT Group has been criticised for running secret trials of the service.
The UK Information Commissioner's Office had voiced legal concerns with Webwise as it is currently implemented, and has said it would only be legal as an "opt-in" service, not an opt-out system. The European Commission had called on the UK to protect Web users' privacy, and opened an infringement proceeding against the country in regard to ISPs' use of Phorm. Some groups, including Amazon.com and the Wikimedia Foundation (the non-profit organization that operates Wikipedia and other collaborative wiki projects), have already requested an opt-out of their websites from scans by the system. Phorm has changed to an opt-in policy. According to Phorm’s website, the company will not collect any data from users who have not explicitly opted into its services. Users must provide separate consent for each web browsing device they use.
Company history.
In its previous incarnation as 121Media, the company made products that were described as spyware. 121Media distributed a program called PeopleOnPage, which was classified as spyware by F-Secure. PeopleOnPage was an application built around their advertising engine, called ContextPlus. ContextPlus was also distributed as a rootkit called Apropos, which used tricks to prevent the user from removing the application and sent information back to central servers regarding a user's browsing habits.
The Center for Democracy and Technology, a U.S.-based advocacy group, filed a complaint with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in November 2005 over distribution of what it considered spyware, including ContextPlus. They stated that they had investigated and uncovered deceptive and unfair behaviour. This complaint was filed in concert with the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Internet Center, a group that was filing a similar complaint against Integrated Search Technologies with Canadian authorities.
ContextPlus shut down its operations in May 2006 and stated they were "no longer able to ensure the highest standards of quality and customer care". The shutdown came after several major lawsuits against adware vendors had been launched. By September 2007, 121Media had become known as Phorm, and admitted a company history in adware and stated it had closed down the multi-million dollar revenue stream from its PeopleOnPage toolbar, citing consumers’ identification of adware with spyware as the primary cause for the decision.
In early 2008 Phorm admitted to editing its article on Wikipedia. Phorm admitted removing a quotation from "The Guardian"'s commercial executives describing the opposition they have towards its tracking system, and deleting a passage explaining how BT admitted misleading customers over covert Phorm trials in 2007. The changes were quickly noticed and reversed by the online encyclopedia's editors.
Phorm currently resides in Mortimer Street, London, UK with staffing levels of around 35.
Financial losses.
The company made a loss of $32.1 million in 2007, a loss of $49.8 million in 2008 and a loss of $29.7 million in 2009. 2010 was by no means better, with a net loss of $27.9m By the end of 2010 the company had lost more than $107 million, with no perceivable revenue stream. In 2011, Phorm reported losses of $30.5 million and conducted an equity placing of £33.6 million, which paid off the company’s debt.
Proposed advertisement service.
Phorm had worked with major U.S. and British ISPs—including BT Group (formerly British Telecom), Virgin Media, and TalkTalk (at the time owned by The Carphone Warehouse)—on a behavioral targeting advertisement service to monitor browsing habits and serve relevant advertisements to the end user. Phorm say these deals would have given them access to the surfing habits of 70% of British households with broadband. The service, which uses deep packet inspection to check the content of requested web pages, has been compared to those of NebuAd and Front Porch.
The service, which would have been marketed to end-users as "Webwise", (in 2009 the BBC took legal advice over the trade mark Webwise), would work by categorising user interests and matching them with advertisers who wish to target that type of user. "As you browse we're able to categorise all of your Internet actions", said Phorm COO Virasb Vahidi. "We actually can see the entire Internet".
The company says that data collected would be completely anonymous and that Phorm will never be aware of the identity of the user or what they have browsed, and adds that Phorm's advertising categories exclude sensitive terms and have been widely drawn so as not to reveal the identity of the user. By monitoring users' browsing, Phorm even says they are able to offer some protection against online fraud and phishing.
Phorm formerly maintained an opt out policy for its services. However, according to a spokesman for Phorm, the way the opt-out works means the contents of the websites visited will still be mirrored to its system. All computers, all users, and all http applications used by each user of each computer will need to be configured (or supplemented with add ons) to opt out. It has since been declared by the Information Commissioner's Office that Phorm would only be legal under UK law if it were an opt-in service.
Implementation.
Richard Clayton, a Cambridge University security researcher, attended an on-the-record meeting with Phorm, and published his account of how their advertising system is implemented.
Phorm's system, like many websites, uses HTTP cookies (small pieces of text) to store user settings. The company said that an initial web request is redirected three times (using HTTP 307 responses) within their system, so that they can inspect cookies to determine if the user has opted out. The system then sets a unique Phorm tracking identifier (UID) for the user (or collects it if it already exists), and adds a cookie that is forged to appear to come from the requested website.
In an analysis titled "Stealing Phorm Cookies", Clayton wrote that Phorm's system stores a tracking cookie for each website visited on the user's PC, and that each contains an identical copy of the user's UID. Where possible, Phorm's system strips its tracking cookies from http requests before they are forwarded across the internet to a website's server, but it cannot prevent the UID from being sent to websites using https. This would allow websites to associate the UID to any details the website collects about the visitor.
Phorm Senior Vice President of Technology Marc Burgess has said that the collected information also includes a timestamp. Burgess said, "This is enough information to accurately target an ad in future, but cannot be used to find out a) who you are, or b) where you have browsed".
Incentives.
In 2008 Phorm considered offering an incentive, in addition to the phishing protection it originally planned, as a means to convince end-users to opt into its Webwise system. The alternate incentives, suggested in a Toluna.com market research survey carried out on behalf of Phorm, included further phishing protection, a donation to charity, a free technical support line, or one pound off opted-in users' monthly broadband subscriptions.
Following the decision by Wikimedia Foundation and Amazon to opt their websites out of being profiled by Phorm's Webwise system, and as an incentive for websites to remain opted into the Phorm profiling system, Phorm have launched Webwise Discover. The Korean launch of this web publisher incentive was announced in a press conference in Covent Garden in London on 3 June 2009.
Website publishers are invited to upload a web widget which will provide a small frame to display recommended web links, based on the tracked interests of any Phorm-tracked website visitors (those whose ISP uses Phorm Deep Packet Inspection to intercept and profile web traffic). There would be no charge to the website, and Phorm do not stand to make any money from Webwise Discover; however, there are plans to display targeted adverts in the future.The widget would only deliver link recommendations if the user was signed up for targeted advertising with a Phorm-affiliated ISP, the widget would be invisible to everyone else.. [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/06/03/phorm_webwise_discover/ At the press launch Phorm spokespersons admitted that at present not a single UK ISP or website has yet signed up to Webwise Discover system, although they emphasised it was part of the current Korea Telecom Webwise trials. Legal advice has been offered to websites considering signing up to the OIX system by Susan Singleton.[http://www.marketingdirectmag.co.uk/news/907369/brands-follow-Amazons-lead-opt-Phorm/
Legality.
The Open Rights Group (ORG) raised questions about Phorm's legality and asked for clarification of how the service would work. FIPR has argued that Phorm's online advert system is illegal in the UK. Nicholas Bohm, general counsel at FIPR, said: "The need for both parties to consent to interception in order for it to be lawful is an extremely basic principle within the legislation, and it cannot be lightly ignored or treated as a technicality." His open letter to the Information Commissioner has been published on the FIPR web site.
The Conservative peer Lord Northesk has questioned whether the UK government is taking any action on the targeted advertising service offered by Phorm in the light of the questions about its legality under the Data Protection and Regulation of Investigatory Powers Acts.
On 9 April 2008, the Information Commissioner's Office ruled that Phorm would only be legal under UK law if it were an opt-in service. The Office stated it will closely monitor the testing and implementation of Phorm, in order to ensure data protection laws are observed.
The UK Home Office has indicated that Phorm's proposed service is only legal if users give explicit consent. The Office itself became a subject of controversy when emails between it and Phorm were released. The emails showed that the company edited a draft legal interpretation by the Office, and that an official responded "If we agree this, and this becomes our position do you think your clients and their prospective partners will be comforted". Liberal Democrat spokeswoman on Home Affairs, Baroness Sue Miller, considered it an act of collusion: "The fact the Home Office asks the very company they are worried is actually falling outside the laws whether the draft interpretation of the law is correct is completely bizarre."
"The Register" reported in May 2008 that Phorm's logo strongly resembled that of an unrelated UK company called Phorm Design. They quoted the smaller company's owner, Simon Griffiths: "I've had solicitors look at it and they say we'd have to go to court. are obviously a big player with a lot of clout. I'm a small design agency in Sheffield that employs three people."
Until 21 September 2010, Phorm's Webwise service also shared the same name as BBC WebWise.
Monitoring of the Phorm website using a Website change detection service allerted interested parties to changes on 21 September 2010. Phorm's website had been edited to remove references to the word 'Webwise'. Phorm's Webwise product had become 'PhormDiscover'.
The Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM) Trade Marks and Designs Registration Office of the European Union website CTM-Online database lists Phorm's application for use of the 'Webwise' trade mark name. The British Broadcasting Corporation is listed as an opponent on grounds of 'Likelihood of confusion'. The City of London based legal firm Bristows wrote to the OHIM on 22 September 2010, withdrawing the BBC's opposition saying, "The British Broadcasting Corporation have instructed us to request the withdrawal of the above Opposition No. B11538985" 
On 28 October 2010, BT removed the Webwise pages from their company website although it was not until 12 November 2010 that all pages had finally been confirmed as removed by forum contributors at the campaign group called "NoDPI.org".
, Virgin Media had not removed their Phorm and Webwise FAQs from their customer-news section.
European Commission case against UK over Phorm.
European Union communications commissioner Viviane Reding has said that the commission was concerned Phorm was breaching consumer privacy directives, and called on the UK Government to take action to protect consumers' privacy. The European Commission wrote to the UK government on 30 June 2008 to set out the context of the EU's interest in the controversy, and asked detailed questions ahead of possible Commission intervention. It required the UK to respond to the letter one month after it was sent. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) admitted on 16 August that the UK had not met the deadline.
On 16 September, BERR refused "The Register" request to release the full text of their reply to the European Commission, but released a statement to the effect that the UK authorities consider Phorm's products are capable of being operated in a lawful, appropriate and transparent fashion. Unsatisfied by the response, the European Commission wrote to the UK again on 6 October. Martin Selmayr, spokesman for Reding's Information Society and Media directorate-general said, "For us the matter is not finished. Quite the contrary."
The UK government responded again in November, but the Commission sent another letter to the government in January 2009. This third letter was sent because the Commission was not satisfied with explanations about implementation of European law in the context of the Phorm case. Selmayr was quoted in "The Register" as saying, "The European Commission's investigation with regard to the Phorm case is still ongoing", and he went on to say that the Commission may have to proceed to formal action if the UK authorities do not provide a satisfactory response to the Commission's concerns.
On 14 April, the European Commission said they have "opened an infringement proceeding against the United Kingdom" regarding ISPs' use of Phorm:
That day, in response to a news item by "The Register" regarding the European Commission's preparations to sue the UK government, Phorm said their technology "is fully compliant with UK legislation and relevant EU directives. This has been confirmed by BERR and by the UK regulatory authorities and we note that there is no suggestion to the contrary in the Commission's statement today." However, BERR denied such confirmation when they responded to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request also made that day:
In January 2012, the EU dropped its case against the UK government.
Reaction.
Initial reaction to the proposed service highlighted deep concerns with regards to individual privacy and property rights in data. Phorm has defended its technology in the face of what it called "misinformation" from bloggers claiming it threatens users' privacy.
Most security firms classify Phorm's targeting cookies as adware. Kaspersky Lab, whose anti-virus engine is licensed to many other security vendors, said it would detect the cookie as adware. Trend Micro said there was a "very high chance" that it would add detection for the tracking cookies as adware. PC Tools echoed Trend's concerns about privacy and security, urging Phorm to apply an opt-in approach. Specialist anti-spyware firm Sunbelt Software also expressed concerns, saying Phorm's tracking cookies were candidates for detection by its anti-spyware software.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, said: "The message has to be this: if you care about your privacy, do not use BT, Virgin or Talk-Talk as your internet provider." He added that, historically, anonymising technology had never worked. Even if it did, he stressed, it still posed huge privacy issues.
Phorm has engaged a number of public relations advisers including Freuds, Citigate Dewe Rogerson and ex-House of Commons media adviser John Stonborough in an attempt to save its reputation, and has engaged with audiences via moderated online webchats. 
The creator of the World Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, has criticised the idea of tracking his browsing history saying that "It's mine - you can't have it. If you want to use it for something, then you have to negotiate with me. I have to agree, I have to understand what I'm getting in return." He also said that he would change his ISP if they introduced the Phorm system. As Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Berners-Lee also published a set of personal design notes titled "No Snooping", in which he explains his views on commercial use of packet inspection and references Phorm.
Simon Davies, a privacy advocate and founding member of Privacy International, said "Behavioural advertising is a rather spooky concept for many people." In a separate role at 80/20 Thinking, a consultancy start-up, he was engaged by Phorm to look at the system. He said: "We were impressed with the effort that had been put into minimising the collection of personal information". He was subsequently quoted as saying "International DOES NOT endorse Phorm, though we do applaud a number of developments in its process". "The system does appear to mitigate a number of core privacy problems in profiling, retention and tracking ... we won't as PI support any system that works on an opt-out basis." Kent Ertugrul later said he made a mistake when he suggested Privacy International had endorsed Phorm: "This was my confusion I apologise. The endorsement was in fact from Simon Davies, the MD of 80 / 20 who is also a director of privacy international."
Stopphoulplay.com.
Ertugrul has set up a website called "Stopphoulplay.com", in reaction to Phorm critics Alexander Hanff and Marcus Williamson. Ertugrul called Hanff a "serial agitator" who has run campaigns against both Phorm and other companies such as Procter & Gamble, and says Williamson is trying to disgrace Ertugrul and Phorm through "serial letter writing". Hanff believes the Stopphoulplay website's statements are "completely irrelevant" to his campaign and that they will backfire on Ertugrul, while Williamson laments that Phorm "has now stooped to personal smears".
When it launched on 28 April 2009, Stopphoulplay.com discussed a petition to the UK Prime Minister on the Downing Street website. When originally launched the web page claimed, "The website managers at 10 Downing Street recognised their mistake in allowing a misleading petition to appear on their site, and have since provided assurances to Phorm that they will not permit this to happen again". That same day, the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act was used to request confirmation of the claim by Phorm and on 29 April Phorm removed the quoted text from the website and replaced it with nothing. The Prime Minister's Office replied to the FOI request on 28 May, stating they held no information in relation to the request concerning Phorm's claim.
A day after the site's launch, BBC correspondent Darren Waters wrote, "This is a battle with no sign of a ceasefire, with both sides and anti-Phorm campaigners settling down to a war of attrition, and with governments, both in the UK and the EU, drawn into the crossfire."
The site was closed down in September 2009 and now redirects to the main Phorm site.
BT trials.
After initial denials, BT Group confirmed they ran a small scale trial, at one exchange, of a "prototype advertising platform" in 2007. The trial involved tens of thousands of end users. BT customers will be able to opt out of the trial—BT said they are developing an improved, non-cookie based opt-out of Phorm—but no decision has been made as to their post-trial approach.
"The Register" reported that BT ran an earlier secret trial in 2006, in which it intercepted and profiled the web browsing of 18,000 of its broadband customers. The technical report states that customers who participated in the trial were not made aware of the profiling, as one of the aims of the validation was not to affect their experience.
On 4 June 2008, a copy of a 52-page report allegedly from inside BT, titled "PageSense External Technical Validation", was uploaded to WikiLeaks. The report angered many members of the public; there are questions regarding the involvement of charity ads for Oxfam, Make Trade Fair and SOS Children's Villages, and whether or not they were made aware that their ads were being used in what many feel were highly illegal technical trials.
FIPR's Nicholas Bohm has said that trials of an online ad system carried out by BT involving more than 30,000 of its customers were potentially illegal.
BT's third trial of Phorm's Webwise system repeatedly slipped. The trial was to last for approximately two weeks on 10,000 subscribers, and was originally due to start in March 2008, then pushed to April and again to the end of May; it has yet to occur. The company is facing legal action over trials of Phorm that were carried out without user consent.
On 2 September 2008, while investigating a complaint made by anti-Phorm protestors, the City of London Police met with BT representatives to informally question them about the secret Phorm trials. On 25 September the Police announced that there will be no formal investigation of BT over its secret trials of Phorm in 2006 and 2007. According to Alex Hanff, the police said there was no criminal intent on behalf of BT and there was implied consent because the service was going to benefit customers. Bohm said of that police response:
On 29 September 2008, it was announced in BT's support forum that their trial of Phorm's Webwise system would commence the following day. BT press officer Adam Liversage stated that BT is still working on a network-level opt-out, but that it will not be offered during the trial. Opted-out traffic will pass through the Webwise system but will not be mirrored or profiled. The final full roll-out of Webwise across BT's national network will not necessarily depend the completion of the work either.
The Open Rights Group urged BT's customers not to participate in the BT Webwise trials, saying their "anti-fraud" feature is unlikely to have advantages over features already built into web browsers.
Subscribers to BT forums had used the Beta forums to criticise and raise concerns about BT's implementation of Phorm, but BT responded with a statement: 
According to Kent Ertugrul, BT would have completed the rollout of its software by the end of 2009. The "Wall Street Journal", however, reported in July 2009 that BT had no plans to do so by then, and was concentrating on "other opportunities". Phorm's share price fell 40% on the news.
On July 6, 2009 BT's former chief press officer, Adam Liversage, described his thoughts using Twitter: "A year of the most intensive, personal-reputation-destroying PR trench warfare all comes to nothing". He ended his comment with "Phantastic".
In October 2009, Sergeant Mike Reed of the City of London Police answered a Freedom of Information (FOI) request. He confirmed the crime reference number as 5253/08. In his response, he stated that after originally passing case papers to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in December 2008, the police were '"asked to provide further evidence, by the CPS in October 2009". Asked to "Disclose the date when that investigation was reopened", he said that it was "on instruction of the CPS in October 2009". In Sergeant Reed's response he named the officer in charge as "D/S Murray".
On 25 February 2010, it was reported that the CPS continued to work on a potential criminal case against BT over its secret trials of Phorm's system. Prosecutors considered whether or not to press criminal charges against unnamed individuals under Part I of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act.
It was not until April 2011 the CPS decided not to prosecute as it would not be in the public interest, stating that neither Phorm nor BT had acted in bad faith and any penalty imposed would be nominal.
In April 2012, reports said that an officer of the City of London Police had been taken to lunch by Phorm. A police spokesperson was quoted as saying they were aware of the allegation, and that while no formal complaint had been received, "The force is reviewing the information available to it before deciding the best course of action." The spokesperson also highlighted that, "City of London Police were not involved in an investigation into BT Phorm and that the decision not to investigate was prompted by CPS advice".
Advertisers and websites.
Advertisers which had initially expressed an interest about Phorm include: "Financial Times", "The Guardian", Universal McCann, MySpace, iVillage, MGM OMD, Virgin Media and Unanimis. The Guardian has withdrawn from its targeted advertising deal with Phorm; in an email to a reader, advertising manager Simon Kilby stated "It is true that we have had conversations with them regarding their services but we have concluded at this time that we do not want to be part of the network. Our decision was in no small part down to the conversations we had internally about how this product sits with the values of our company." In response to an article published in "The Register" on 26 March 2008, Phorm has stated that MySpace has not joined OIX as a Publisher. The Financial Times has decided not to participate in Phorm's impending trial.
The ORG's Jim Killock said that many businesses "will think data and relationships should simply be private until they and their customers decide," and might even believe "having their data spied upon is a form of industrial espionage". David Evans of the British Computer Society has questioned whether the act of publishing a website on the net is the same as giving consent for advertisers to make use of the site's content or to monitor the site's interactions with its customers.
Pete John created an add on, called Dephormation, for servers and web users to opt out and remain opted-out of the system; however, John ultimately recommends that users switch from Phorm-equipped Internet providers: "Dephormation is not a solution. Its a fig leaf for your privacy. Do not rely on Dephormation to protect your privacy and security. You need to find a new ISP."
In April 2009, Amazon.com announced that it would not allow Phorm to scan any of its domains. The Wikimedia Foundation has also requested an opt-out from scans, and took the necessary steps to block all Wikimedia and Wikipedia domains from being processed by the Phorm system on the 16th of that month.
In July 2009 the Nationwide Building Society confirmed that it would prevent Phorm from scanning its website, in order to protect the privacy of its customers.
Internet service providers.
MetroFi, an American municipal wireless network provider linked to Phrom, ceased operations in 2008.
Three other ISPs linked to Phorm all changed or clarified their plans since first signing on with the company. In response to customer concerns, TalkTalk said that its implementation would have been "opt-in" only (as opposed to BT's "opt-out") and those that don't "opt in" will have their traffic split to avoid contact with a WebWise (Phorm) server. In July 2009, the company confirmed it would not implement Phorm; Charles Dunstone, boss of its parent company, told the "Times" "We were only going to do it if BT did it and if the whole industry was doing it. We were not interested enough to do it on our own."
Business news magazine "New Media Age" reported on 23 April that Virgin Media moved away from Phorm and was expected to sign a deal with another company named Audience Science, while BT would meet with other advertising companies to gain what the ISP calls "general market intelligence" about Phorm. 
"NMA" had called the moves "a shift in strategy by the two media companies". A day later, the magazine said both companies' relationships with Phorm actually remain unchanged.
Although Virgin Media were reported to have "moved away from Phorm", in November 2010 they were the only UK-based ISP to still carry information about Phorm's Webwise system on their website. In addition, Phorm partners with international ISPs Oi, Telefonica in Brazil, TTNET-Türk Telekom in Turkey, and Romtelecom in Romania.

South Korea.
Phorm announced the beginning of a market trial in South Korea via the London Stock Exchange's Regulatory News Service (RNS) on 30 March 2009. Subsequently they announced via RNS on 21 May 2009 that they had commenced the trial. On 8 July 2009 Phorm indicated that the trials were proceeding as expected. In their Notice of 2009 Interim Report & Accounts, published on 14 September 2009, Phorm stated they were "Nearing completion of a substantial market trial, launched in May, with KT, the largest ISP in South Korea". The existence of the trial in South Korea was publicised by OhmyNews on 2 September 2009. On 9 September 2009 OhMyNews announced that the trial had been shut down.
Brazil.
On 26 March 2010, Phorm announced that its plans for commercial deployment in Brazil.
In May 2012, the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee issued a resolution recommending against the use of Phorm products by any internet service providers in the country, citing privacy risks and concerns that Phorm's products would degrade the quality of internet services.
In respect of the proposed partnership with Telemar (now known as Oi) the claim is that iG, a web portal, only has 5% penetration in the market and Phorm did not clear R$400 million "last year".
Turkey.
Since launching with TTNET, a subsidiary of Türk Telecom Group, in Turkey in 2012, Phorm has now successfully launched its platform with five additional ISPs. Accordingly, on a global basis, there are now over 20 million daily users on Phorm's platform.
China.
Phorm announced on 3 October 2013 that it had launched operationally in China and had commenced a nationwide opt-in process. The company announced that it has commenced commercial operations in China and is serving advertisements on a paid basis.
Privacy concerns in China and Hong Kong are growing, and there have been significant developments in privacy regulation, which could impact on Phorm operations in both the mainland and Hong Kong.
In May 2012 mainland China passed new regulations which implement measures protecting consumer privacy from commercial exploitation.
Further privacy legislation arrived in April 2013, with the publication of two draft rules from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology: "Provisions on the Protection of the Personal Information of Telecommunications (Provisions for Telecommunications and Internet Users), and "Internet Users and the Provisions on Registration of the True Identity Information of Phone Users" (Provisions on Phone Users), along with draft amendments to the 1993 Law of Consumer Rights.
The laws are emerging as e-commerce in China becomes an increasingly significant part of the Chinese economy.
These new regulations, which include provisions regulating data collection by smart devices, are discussed in an article published by the International Association of Privacy Professionals' "Privacy Tracker" blog called "Making Sense of China's New Privacy Laws".
In Hong Kong, The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data ("PCPD") has taken a robust approach to the protection of consumer privacy, as they seek to enforce the provisions of the Personal Data (Privacy) (Amendment) Ordinance 2012 ("Amendment Ordinance") which came into force in April 2013.

Marquis de Sade

Donatien Alphonse François de Sade (2 June 1740 – 2 December 1814), better known as the Marquis de Sade (), was a French aristocrat, revolutionary politician, philosopher and writer, famous for his libertine sexuality. His works include novels, short stories, plays, dialogues and political tracts; in his lifetime some were published under his own name, while others appeared anonymously and Sade denied being their author. He is best known for his erotic works, which combined philosophical discourse with pornography, depicting sexual fantasies with an emphasis on violence, criminality and blasphemy against the Catholic Church. He was a proponent of extreme freedom, unrestrained by morality, religion or law. The words "sadism" and "sadist" are derived from his name.
Sade was incarcerated in various prisons and in an insane asylum for about 32 years of his life; 11 years in Paris (10 of which were spent in the Bastille), a month in the Conciergerie, two years in a fortress, a year in Madelonnettes, three years in Bicêtre, a year in Sainte-Pélagie and 13 years in the Charenton asylum. During the French Revolution he was an elected delegate to the National Convention. Many of his works were written in prison.
Life.
Early life and education.
The Marquis de Sade was born in the Hôtel de Condé, Paris, to Jean Baptiste François Joseph, Count de Sade and Marie Eléonore de Maillé de Carman, cousin and Lady-in-waiting to the Princess of Condé. He was educated by an uncle, the Abbé de Sade. Later, he attended a Jesuit "lycée", then pursued a military career, becoming Colonel of a Dragoon regiment, and fighting in the Seven Years' War. In 1763, on returning from war, he courted a rich magistrate's daughter, but her father rejected his suitorship and, instead, arranged a marriage with his elder daughter, Renée-Pélagie de Montreuil; that marriage produced two sons and a daughter. In 1766, he had a private theatre built in his castle, the Château de Lacoste, in Provence. In January 1767, his father died.
Title and heirs.
The men of the Sade family alternated between using the "marquis" and "comte" (count) titles. His grandfather, Gaspard François de Sade, was the first to use "marquis"; occasionally, he was the "Marquis de Sade", but is identified in documents as the "Marquis de Mazan". The Sade family were "noblesse d'épée", claiming at the time the oldest, Frank-descended nobility, so, assuming a noble title without a King's grant, was customarily "". Alternating title usage indicates that titular hierarchy (below "duc et pair") was notional; theoretically, the "marquis" title was granted to noblemen owning "several" countships, but its use by men of dubious lineage caused its disrepute. At Court, precedence was by seniority and royal favour, not title. There is father-and-son correspondence, wherein father addresses son as "marquis".
For many years, Sade's descendants regarded his life and work as a scandal to be suppressed. This did not change until the mid-twentieth century, when the Comte Xavier de Sade reclaimed the marquis title, long fallen into disuse, on his visiting cards, and took an interest in his ancestor's writings. At that time, the "Divine Marquis" of legend was so unmentionable in his own family that Xavier de Sade only learned of him in the late 1940s when approached by a journalist. He subsequently discovered a store of Sade's papers in the family château at Condé-en-Brie, and worked with scholars for decades to enable their publication. His youngest son, the Marquis Thibault de Sade, has continued the collaboration. The family have also claimed a trademark on the name. The Château de Condé was sold by the family in 1983. As well as the manuscripts they retain, others are held in universities and libraries. Many, however, were lost in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. A substantial amount were destroyed after Sade's death at the instigation of his son, Donatien-Claude-Armand.
Scandals and imprisonment.
Sade lived a scandalous libertine existence and repeatedly procured young prostitutes as well as employees of both sexes in his castle in Lacoste. He was also accused of blasphemy, a serious offence at that time. His behavior included an affair with his wife's sister, Anne-Prospère, who had come to live at the castle.
Beginning in 1763, Sade lived mainly in or near Paris. Several prostitutes there complained about mistreatment by him and he was put under surveillance by the police, who made detailed reports of his activities. After several short imprisonments, which included a brief incarceration in the Château de Saumur (then a prison), he was exiled to his château at Lacoste in 1768.
The first major scandal occurred on Easter Sunday in 1768, in which Sade procured the sexual services of a woman, Rose Keller; whether she was a prostitute or not is widely disputed. He was accused of taking her to his chateau at Arcueil, imprisoning her there and sexually and physically abusing her. She escaped by climbing out of a second-floor window and running away. At this time, la Présidente, de Sade's mother-in-law, obtained a "lettre de cachet" (a royal order of arrest and imprisonment, without stated cause or access to the courts) from the king, excluding Sade from the jurisdiction of the courts. The "lettre de cachet" would later prove disastrous for the marquis.
In 1772, an episode in Marseille involved the non-lethal poisoning of prostitutes with the supposed aphrodisiac Spanish fly and sodomy with Latour, his manservant. That year, the two men were sentenced to death "in absentia" for sodomy and the poisoning. They fled to Italy, Sade taking his wife's sister with him. Sade and Latour were caught and imprisoned at the Fortress of Miolans in late 1772, but escaped four months later.
Sade later hid at Lacoste, where he rejoined his wife, who became an accomplice in his subsequent endeavors. He kept a group of young employees at Lacoste, most of whom complained about sexual mistreatment and quickly left his service. Sade was forced to flee to Italy once again. It was during this time he wrote "Voyage d'Italie". In 1776, he returned to Lacoste, again hired several servant girls, most of whom fled. In 1777, the father of one of those employees went to Lacoste to claim his daughter, and attempted to shoot the Marquis at point-blank range, but the gun misfired.
Later that year, Sade was tricked into going to Paris to visit his supposedly ill mother, who in fact had recently died. He was arrested there and imprisoned in the Château de Vincennes. He successfully appealed his death sentence in 1778, but remained imprisoned under the "lettre de cachet". He escaped but was soon recaptured. He resumed writing and met fellow prisoner Comte de Mirabeau, who also wrote erotic works. Despite this common interest, the two came to dislike each other intensely.
In 1784, Vincennes was closed and Sade was transferred to the Bastille. On 2 July 1789, he reportedly shouted out from his cell to the crowd outside, "They are killing the prisoners here!", and a disturbance began to foment. Two days later, he was transferred to the insane asylum at Charenton near Paris. The storming of the Bastille, a major event of the French Revolution, would occur a few days later on 14 July.
He had been working on his magnum opus "Les 120 Journées de Sodome". To his despair, he believed that the manuscript was lost during his transfer; but he continued to write.
In 1790, he was released from Charenton after the new Constituent Assembly abolished the instrument of "lettre de cachet". His wife obtained a divorce soon after.
Return to freedom, delegate to the National Convention and imprisonment.
During Sade's time of freedom, beginning in 1790, he published several of his books anonymously. He met Marie-Constance Quesnet, a former actress, and mother of a six-year-old son, who had been abandoned by her husband. Constance and de Sade would stay together for the rest of his life.
He initially ingratiated himself with the new political situation after the revolution, supported the Republic, called himself "Citizen de Sade" and managed to obtain several official positions despite his aristocratic background.
Because of the damage done to his estate in Lacoste, which was sacked in 1789 by an angry mob, he moved to Paris. In 1790, he was elected to the National Convention, where he represented the far left. He was a member of the Piques section, notorious for its radical views. He wrote several political pamphlets, in which he called for the implementation of direct vote. However, there is much to suggest that he suffered abuse from his fellow revolutionaries due to his aristocratic background. Matters were not helped by his son's May 1792 desertion from the military, where he had been serving as a second lieutenant and the "aide-de-camp" to an important colonel, the Marquis de Toulengeon. Sade was forced to disavow his son's desertion in order to save his neck. Later that year, his name was added – whether by error or wilful malice – to the list of émigrés of the Bouches-du-Rhône department.
Despite being appalled by the Reign of Terror in 1793, he wrote an admiring eulogy for Jean-Paul Marat. At this stage, he was becoming publicly critical of Maximilien Robespierre, and on 5 December, he was removed from his posts, accused of "moderatism" and imprisoned for almost a year. He was released in 1794, after the overthrow and execution of Robespierre had effectively ended the Reign of Terror.
In 1796, now all but destitute, he had to sell his ruined castle in Lacoste.
Imprisonment for his writings and death.
In 1801, Napoleon Bonaparte ordered the arrest of the anonymous author of "Justine" and "Juliette". Sade was arrested at his publisher's office and imprisoned without trial; first in the Sainte-Pélagie prison and, following allegations that he had tried to seduce young fellow prisoners there, in the harsh fortress of Bicêtre.
After intervention by his family, he was declared insane in 1803 and transferred once more to the asylum at Charenton. His ex-wife and children had agreed to pay his pension there. Constance was allowed to live with him at Charenton. The benign director of the institution, Abbé de Coulmier, allowed and encouraged him to stage several of his plays, with the inmates as actors, to be viewed by the Parisian public. Coulmier's novel approaches to psychotherapy attracted much opposition. In 1809, new police orders put Sade into solitary confinement and deprived him of pens and paper. In 1813, the government ordered Coulmier to suspend all theatrical performances.
Sade began a sexual relationship with 14-year-old Madeleine LeClerc, daughter of an employee at Charenton. This affair lasted some 4 years, until his death in 1814.
He had left instructions in his will forbidding that his body be opened for any reason whatsoever, and that it remain untouched for 48 hours in the chamber in which he died, and then placed in a coffin and buried on his property located in Malmaison near Épernon. His skull was later removed from the grave for phrenological examination. His son had all his remaining unpublished manuscripts burned, including the immense multi-volume work "Les Journées de Florbelle".
Appraisal and criticism.
Numerous writers and artists, especially those concerned with sexuality, have been both repelled and fascinated by Sade.
The contemporary rival pornographer Rétif de la Bretonne published an "Anti-Justine" in 1798.
Geoffrey Gorer, an English anthropologist and author (1905–1985), wrote one of the earliest books on de Sade entitled "The Revolutionary Ideas of the Marquis de Sade" in 1935. He pointed out that Sade was in complete opposition to contemporary philosophers for both his "complete and continual denial of the right to property," and for viewing the struggle in late 18th century French society as being not between "the Crown, the bourgeoisie, the aristocracy or the clergy, or sectional interests of any of these against one another", but rather all of these "more or less united against the proletariat." By holding these views, he cut himself off entirely from the revolutionary thinkers of his time to join those of the mid-nineteenth century. Thus, Gorer argued, "he can with some justice be called the first reasoned socialist."
Simone de Beauvoir (in her essay "Must we burn Sade?", published in "Les Temps modernes", December 1951 and January 1952) and other writers have attempted to locate traces of a radical philosophy of freedom in Sade's writings, preceding modern existentialism by some 150 years. He has also been seen as a precursor of Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis in his focus on sexuality as a motive force. The surrealists admired him as one of their forerunners, and Guillaume Apollinaire famously called him "the freest spirit that has yet existed".
Pierre Klossowski, in his 1947 book "Sade Mon Prochain" ("Sade My Neighbour"), analyzes Sade's philosophy as a precursor of nihilism, negating Christian values and the materialism of the Enlightenment.
One of the essays in Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno's "Dialectic of Enlightenment" (1947) is titled "Juliette or Enlightenment and Morality" and interprets the ruthless and calculating behavior of "Juliette" as the embodiment of the philosophy of enlightenment. Similarly, psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan posited in his 1966 essay "Kant avec de Sade" that Sade's ethics was the complementary completion of the categorical imperative originally formulated by Immanuel Kant. However, at least one philosopher has rejected Adorno and Horkheimer’s claim that Sade’s moral skepticism is actually coherent, or that it reflects Enlightenment thought.
In his 1988 "Political Theory and Modernity", William E. Connolly analyzes Sade's "Philosophy in the Bedroom" as an argument against earlier political philosophers, notably Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Thomas Hobbes, and their attempts to reconcile nature, reason and virtue as basis of ordered society. Similarly, Camille Paglia argued that Sade can be best understood as a satirist, responding "point by point" to Rousseau's claims that society inhibits and corrupts mankind's innate goodness: Paglia notes that Sade wrote in the aftermath of the French Revolution, when Rousseauist Jacobins instituted the bloody Reign of Terror and Rousseau's predictions were brutally disproved.
In "The Sadeian Woman: And the Ideology of Pornography" (1979), Angela Carter provides a feminist reading of Sade, seeing him as a "moral pornographer" who creates spaces for women. Similarly, Susan Sontag defended both Sade and Georges Bataille's "Histoire de l'oeil" ("Story of the Eye") in her essay "The Pornographic Imagination" (1967) on the basis their works were transgressive texts, and argued that neither should be censored. By contrast, Andrea Dworkin saw Sade as the exemplary woman-hating pornographer, supporting her theory that pornography inevitably leads to violence against women. One chapter of her book "Pornography: Men Possessing Women" (1979) is devoted to an analysis of Sade. Susie Bright claims that Dworkin's first novel "Ice and Fire", which is rife with violence and abuse, can be seen as a modern retelling of Sade's "Juliette".
Influence.
Various influential cultural figures have expressed a great interest in Sade's work, including the French philosopher Michel Foucault, the American film maker John Waters and the Spanish filmmaker Jesús Franco. The poet Algernon Charles Swinburne is also said to have been highly influenced by Sade.
Ian Brady, who with Myra Hindley carried out torture and murder of children known as the Moors murders in England during the 1960s, was fascinated by Sade, and the suggestion was made at their trial and appeals that the tortures of the children (the screams and pleadings of whom they tape-recorded) were influenced by Sade's ideas and fantasies. A Sade biographer has claimed that Brady and Hindley had read very little of Sade's actual work; the only book of his they possessed was an anthology of excerpts that included none of his most extreme writings.
However, Hindley herself recalled that Brady would send her to obtain books by Sade; after reading them he became sexually aroused and beat her.
Cultural depictions.
There have been many and varied references to the Marquis de Sade in popular culture, including fictional works and biographies. The eponym of the psychological and subcultural term "sadism", his name is used variously to evoke sexual violence, licentiousness and freedom of speech. In modern culture his works are simultaneously viewed as masterful analyses of how power and economics work, and as erotica. de Sade's sexually explicit works were a medium for the articulation of the corrupt and hypocritical values of the elite in his society, which caused him to become imprisoned. He thus became a symbol of the artist's struggle with the censor. Sade's use of pornographic devices to create provocative works that subvert the prevailing moral values of his time inspired many other artists in a variety of media. The cruelties depicted in his works gave rise to the concept of sadism. Sade's works have to this day been kept alive by artists and intellectuals because they espouse a philosophy of extreme individualism that became reality in the economic liberalism of the following centuries.
In the late 20th century, there was a resurgence of interest in Sade; leading French intellectuals like Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault published studies of the philosopher, and interest in Sade among scholars and artists continued. In the realm of visual arts, many surrealist artists had interest in the Marquis. Sade was celebrated in surrealist periodicals, and feted by figures such as Guillaume Apollinaire, Paul Éluard and Maurice Heine; Man Ray admired Sade because he and other surrealists viewed him as an ideal of freedom. The first "Manifesto of Surrealism" (1924) announced that "Sade is surrealist in sadism", and extracts of the original draft of "Justine" were published in "Le Surréalisme au service de la révolution". In literature, Sade is referenced in several stories by horror and science fiction writer (and author of Psycho) Robert Bloch, while Polish science fiction author Stanisław Lem wrote an essay analyzing the game theory arguments appearing in Sade's "Justine". The writer Georges Bataille applied Sade's methods of writing about sexual transgression to shock and provoke readers.
Sade's life and works have been the subject of numerous fictional plays, films, pornographic or erotic drawings, etchings and more.
These include Peter Weiss's play "Marat/Sade", a fantasia extrapolating from the fact that de Sade directed plays performed by his fellow inmates at the Charenton asylum. Yukio Mishima, Barry Yzereef and Doug Wright also wrote plays about Sade; Weiss's and Wright's plays have been made into films. His work is referenced on film at least as early as
Luis Buñuel's "L'Âge d'Or" (1930), the final segment of which provides a coda to Sade's "120 Days of Sodom", with the four debauched noblemen emerging from their mountain retreat. In 1969, American International Films released a German-made production called "de Sade", with Keir Dullea in the title role. Pier Paolo Pasolini filmed "Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom" (1975),
updating Sade's novel to the brief Salò Republic; Benoît Jacquot's "Sade" and Philip Kaufman's "Quills" (from the play of the same name by Doug Wright) both hit cinemas in 2000. "Quills", inspired by Sade's imprisonment and battles with the censorship in his society, portrays Sade as a literary freedom fighter who is a martyr to the cause of free expression.
Often Sade himself has been depicted in American popular culture less as a revolutionary or even as a libertine and more akin to a sadistic and tyrannical villain. For example, in the final episode of the television series "", Miki, the female protagonist, travels back in time and ends up being imprisoned and tortured by Sade. Similarly, in the horror film "Waxwork", Sade is among the film's wax villains to come alive.
Writing.
Literary criticism.
The Marquis de Sade viewed Gothic fiction as a genre that relied heavily on magic and phantasmagoria. In his literary criticism Sade sought to prevent his fiction from being labeled ‘Gothic’ by emphasizing Gothic's supernatural aspects as the fundamental difference from themes in his own work. But while he sought this separation he believed the Gothic played a necessary role in society and discussed its roots and its uses. He wrote that the Gothic novel was a perfectly natural, predictable consequence of the revolutionary sentiments in Europe. He theorized that the adversity of the period had rightfully caused Gothic writers to "look to hell for help in composing their alluring novels." Sade held the work of writers Matthew Lewis and Ann Radcliffe high above other Gothic authors, praising the brilliant imagination of Radcliffe and pointing to Lewis' "The Monk" as without question the genre’s best achievement. Sade nevertheless believed that the genre was at odds with itself, arguing that the supernatural elements within Gothic fiction created an inescapable dilemma for both its author and its readers. He argued that an author in this genre was forced to choose between elaborate explanations of the supernatural or no explanations at all and that in either case the reader was unavoidably rendered incredulous. Despite his celebration of "The Monk", Sade believed that there was not a single Gothic novel that had been able to overcome these problems. He theorized that if these problems were successfully avoided within the genre that the resulting work would be universally regarded for its excellence in fiction.
Many assume that Sade's criticism of the Gothic novel is a reflection of his frustration with sweeping interpretations of works like "Justine". Within his objections to the lack of verisimilitude in the Gothic may have been an attempt to present his own work as the better representation of the whole nature of man. Since Sade professed that the ultimate goal of an author should be to deliver an accurate portrayal of man, it is believed that Sade's attempts to separate himself from the Gothic novel highlights this conviction. For Sade, that his work was best suited for the accomplishment of this goal was in part because he was not chained down by the supernatural silliness that dominated late 18th-century fiction. Moreover, it is believed that Sade praised "The Monk" (which displays Ambrosio’s sacrifice of his humanity to his unrelenting sexual appetite) as the best Gothic novel chiefly because its themes were the closest to those within his own work.
Libertine novels.
Sade's fiction has been tagged under many different titles, including pornography, Gothic, and baroque. Sade’s most famous books are often classified not as Gothic but as libertine novels, and include the novels "Justine, or the Misfortunes of Virtue"; "Juliette"; "The 120 Days of Sodom"; and "Philosophy in the Bedroom". These works challenge perceptions of sexuality, religion, law, age, and gender in ways that Sade would argue are incompatible with the supernatural. The issues of sexual violence, sadomasochism, and pedophilia stunned even those contemporaries of Sade who were quite familiar with the dark themes of the Gothic novel during its popularity in the late 18th century. Suffering is the primary rule, as in these novels one must often decide between sympathizing with the torturer or the victim. While these works focus on the dark side of human nature, the magic and phantasmagoria that dominates the Gothic is noticeably absent and is the primary reason these works are not considered to fit the genre.
Through the unreleased passions of his libertines, Sade wished to shake the world at its core. With "120 Days", for example, Sade wished to present "the most impure tale that has ever been written since the world exists."
Gothic tales.
Though much of the fiction written by the Marquis de Sade has been classified as libertine, his tales in "The Crimes of Love" utilize Gothic conventions. Subtitled "Heroic and Tragic Tales", Sade combines romance and horror, employing several Gothic tropes for dramatic purposes. There is blood, banditti, corpses and, of course, insatiable lust. Compared to works like "Justine", here Sade is relatively tame, as overt eroticism and torture is subtracted for a more psychological approach. It is the impact of sadism instead of acts of sadism itself that emerge in this work, unlike the aggressive and rapacious approach in his libertine works.
An example is "Eugénie de Franval", a tale of incest and retribution. In its portrayal of conventional moralities it is somewhat of a departure from the erotic cruelties and moral ironies that dominate his libertine works. It opens with a domesticated approach:
"To enlighten mankind and improve its morals is the only lesson which we offer in this story. In reading it, may the world discover how great is the peril which follows the footsteps of those who will stop at nothing to satisfy their desires."
Descriptions in "Justine" seem to anticipate Radcliffe's scenery in "Mysteries of Udolpho" and the vaults in "The Italian", but, unlike these stories, there is no escape for Sade's virtuous heroine, Justine. Unlike the milder Gothic fiction of Radcliffe, Sade's horror ends in sodomy, rape or torture. To have a character like Justine, who is stripped without ceremony and bound to a wheel for fondling and thrashing, would be unthinkable in the domestic Gothic fiction written for the bourgeoisie.Sade even contrives a kind of affection between Justine and her tormentors, suggesting shades of masochism in his heroine.
Sadism in the Gothic novel.
Despite the strong adverse reaction to Sade's work and Sade's own disassociation from the Gothic novel, the similarities between the fiction of sadism and the Gothic novel were much closer than many of its readers or providers even realized. After the controversy surrounding Matthew Lewis' "The Monk", Minerva Press released "The New Monk" as a supposed indictment of a wholly immoral book. It features the sadistic Mrs. Rod, whose boarding school for young women becomes a torture chamber equipped with its own "flogging-room". Ironically, "The New Monk" wound up increasing the level of cruelty, but as a parody of the genre, it illuminates the link between sadism and the Gothic novel.

Surface grinding

Surface grinding is used to produce a smooth finish on flat surfaces. It is a widely used abrasive machining process in which a spinning wheel covered in rough particles (grinding wheel) cuts chips of metallic or nonmetallic substance from a workpiece, making a face of it flat or smooth.
Process.
Surface grinding is the most common of the grinding operations. It is a finishing process that uses a rotating abrasive wheel to smooth the flat surface of metallic or nonmetallic materials to give them a more refined look or to attain a desired surface for a functional purpose.
The surface grinder is composed of an abrasive wheel, a workholding device known as a chuck, and a reciprocating or rotary table. The chuck holds the material in place while it is being worked on. It can do this one of two ways: ferromagnetic pieces are held in place by a magnetic chuck, while non-ferromagnetic and nonmetallic pieces are held in place by vacuum or mechanical means. A machine vise (made from ferromagnetic steel or cast iron) placed on the magnetic chuck can be used to hold non-ferromagnetic workpieces if only a magnetic chuck is available. 
Factors to consider in surface grinding are the material of the grinding wheel and the material of the piece being worked on.
Typical workpiece materials include cast iron and mild steel. These two materials don't tend to clog the grinding wheel while being processed. Other materials are aluminum, stainless steel, brass and some plastics. When grinding at high temperatures, the material tends to become weakened and is more inclined to corrode. This can also result in a loss of magnetism in materials where this is applicable.
The grinding wheel is not limited to a cylindrical shape and can have a myriad of options that are useful in transferring different geometries to the object being worked on. Straight wheels can be dressed by the operator to produce custom geometries. When surface grinding an object, one must keep in mind that the shape of the wheel will be transferred to the material of the object like a mirror image.
"Spark out" is a term used when precision values are sought and literally means "until the sparks are out (no more)". It involves passing the workpiece under the wheel, without resetting the depth of cut, more than once and generally multiple times. This ensures that any inconsistencies in the machine or workpiece are eliminated.
Equipment.
A surface grinder is a machine tool used to provide precision ground surfaces, either to a critical size or for the surface finish.
The typical precision of a surface grinder depends on the type and usage, however +/- 0.002 mm (+/- 0.0001") should be achievable on most surface grinders. 
The machine consists of a table that traverses both longitudinally and across the face of the wheel. The longitudinal feed is usually powered by hydraulics, as may the cross feed, however any mixture of hand, electrical or hydraulic may be used depending on the ultimate usage of the machine (i.e.: production, workshop, cost). The grinding wheel rotates in the spindle head and is also adjustable for height, by any of the methods described previously. Modern surface grinders are semi-automated, depth of cut and spark-out may be preset as to the number of passes and, once set up, the machining process requires very little operator intervention.
Depending on the workpiece material, the work is generally held by the use of a magnetic chuck. This may be either an electromagnetic chuck, or a manually operated, permanent magnet type chuck; both types are shown in the first image.
The machine has provision for the application of coolant as well as the extraction of metal dust (metal and grinding particles).
Types of surface grinders.
Horizontal-spindle (peripheral) surface grinders. 
The periphery (flat edge) of the wheel is in contact with the workpiece, producing the flat surface. Peripheral grinding is used in high-precision work on simple flat surfaces; tapers or angled surfaces; slots; flat surfaces next to shoulders; recessed surfaces; and profiles.
Vertical-spindle (wheel-face) grinders. 
The face of a wheel (cup, cylinder, disc, or segmental wheel) is used on the flat surface. Wheel-face grinding is often used for fast material removal, but some machines can accomplish high-precision work. The workpiece is held on a reciprocating table, which can be varied according to the task, or a rotary-table machine, with continuous or indexed rotation. Indexing allows loading or unloading one station while grinding operations are being performed on another.
Disc grinders and double-disc grinders. 
Disc grinding is similar to surface grinding, but with a larger contact area between disc and workpiece. Disc grinders are available in both vertical and horizontal spindle types. Double disc grinders work both sides of a workpiece simultaneously. Disc grinders are capable of achieving especially fine tolerances.
Grinding wheels for surface grinders.
Aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, diamond, and cubic boron nitride (CBN) are four commonly used abrasive materials for the surface of the grinding wheels. Of these materials, aluminum oxide is the most common. Because of cost, diamond and CBN grinding wheels are generally made with a core of less expensive material surrounded by a layer of diamond or CBN. Diamond and CBN wheels are very hard and are capable of economically grinding materials, such as ceramics and carbides, that cannot be ground by aluminum oxide or silicon carbide wheels.
As with any grinding operation, the condition of the wheel is extremely important. Grinding dressers are used to maintain the condition of the wheel, these may be table mounted or mounted in the wheel head where they can be readily applied.
Lubrication.
Lubricants are sometimes used to cool the workpiece and wheel, lubricate the interface, and remove swarf (chips). It must be applied directly to the cutting area to ensure that the fluid is not carried away by the grinding wheel. Common lubricants include water-soluble chemical fluids, water soluble oils, synthetic oils, and petroleum-based oils. The type of lubrication used depends on the workpiece material and is outlined in the table below.
Effects on work material properties.
The high temperatures encountered at the ground surface create residual stresses and a thin martensitic layer may form on the part surface; this decreases the fatigue strength. In ferromagnetic materials, if the temperature of the surface is raised beyond the Curie temperature then it may lose some magnetic properties. Finally, the surface may be more susceptible to corrosion.

1961 Lombank Trophy

The 2nd Lombank Trophy was a motor race, run to Formula One rules, held on 26 March 1961 at Snetterton Motor Racing Circuit, England. The race was run over 37 laps of the circuit, and was won by Australian driver Jack Brabham in a Cooper T53. 
This was the first Formula One event in Europe to be run to the new 1.5 litre rules, and the field was bolstered by a number of Inter-Continental Formula cars, i.e. cars that conformed to the old 2.5 litre Formula One. Only two of the Inter-Continental Formula cars finished the race, but they were a lap ahead of the other finishers. Some of the cars conforming to the new Formula One regulations were converted Formula Two cars.

16th Weapons Squadron

The 16th Weapons Squadron is a United States Air Force unit. It is assigned to the USAF Weapons School, based at Nellis AFB, Nevada.
The 16th began as the 16th Pursuit Squadron on 20 November 1940. During World War II, the 16th Pursuit Squadron flew missions in New Guinea, India, and China in the P-40, P-47, and P-51. During the Korean War, the 16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron flew missions from Korea and Japan in the F-80 and F-86. After the Korean War, the 16th was stationed in Japan, Florida, Norway, Turkey, Korea, and Utah, flying missions in the F-106 and F-4 Phantom II aircraft.
In January 1979, the 16th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron became the USAF's first F-16A/B operational squadron.
History.
World War II.
Activated at Hamilton Field, California in 1941 as a P-40 Pursuit Squadron to defend the West Coast. Deployed to the CBI in March 1942, initially arriving at Karachi, India moving via Australia and Ceylon. It was assigned to Tenth Air Force. The squadron defended the Indian terminus of the "Hump" airlift route over the Himalaya Mountains between India and China and airfields in that area, operating from the Assam Valley of northeast India. The squadron flew strafing, bombing, reconnaissance, and patrol missions in support of Allied ground troops during a Japanese offensive in northern Burma in 1943. 
Moved to southeast China in October 1943, being assigned to Fourteenth Air Force. The squadron defended the Chinese end of the Hump route and air bases in the Kunming area. Attacked Japanese shipping in the Red River delta of Indochina and supported Chinese ground forces in their late 1944 drive along the Salween River. Was reequipped with North American P-51D Mustangs in 1945 to defend the eastern end of the route over the Hump, and to guard air bases in the Kunming area.
The returned to India in the fall of 1945 and sailed for the United States in November. Inactivated on 13 December 1945.
Cold War.
Reactivated at Yontan Air Base Okinawa in 1946 and moved to Naha AB when Yontan closed in 1947. The squadron was assigned to the Twentieth Air Force, 301st Fighter Wing. Pilots engaged in combat operations in Korean War, 1950–1953, returned to Naha Air Base to resume air defense coverage of the Ryukyu Islands in 1954. 
From August 1958 to January 1959, deployed to Ching Chuan Kang Air Base Taiwan to fly combat air support missions for Nationalist Chinese forces after mainland Communist Chinese forces shelled the Nationalist-held islands of Quemoy and Matsu. 
In the early 1960s, the Air Force was implementing Project Clearwater, an initiative to withdraw Convair F-102 Delta Daggers from overseas bases in order to reduce "gold flow" (negative foreign currency transactions). By 1963, part of Clearwater called for the 16th to move to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, permitting the McDonnell F-101 Voodoos of the 15th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron stationed there to be distributed to other Air Defense Command squadrons. However, the Gulf of Tonkin incident intervened and the 16th was kept in the Pacific to maintain an air defense capability there. It deployed F-102s to the Philippines and South Vietnam from August to October 1964 for air defense against possible Communist North Vietnamese air attacks.
Returned to the United States, activating at Eglin AFB, Florida. Became combat ready in the F-4 aircraft in December 1965 with a program of tactical training operations to maintain proficiency. Participated in numerous airpower demonstrations, provided close air support of Army troops during tactical exercises, and prepared for overseas deployments. 
From December 1966 to mid -1967 performed F-4 replacement training. Through deployment of combat-ready tactical components, with personnel and equipment transferred to Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) units upon arrival, the squadron provided fresh aircraft and aircrews for the forces in Southeast Asia, twice relinquished all its resources for combat in SEA and remanned in October 1967 and April 1969. Deployed to South Korea, and assumed alert status at Kunsan and Osan ABs June–September 1970, providing air defense, participating in exercises, and maintaining combat readiness. 
Reassigned to Hill AFB, Utah, and received first production F-16A Fighting Falcon aircraft to be delivered to an operational squadron on 6 January 1979. Many of the early F-16 pilots went through the 16th TFTS, as it was the first RTU for the F-16 and acted as a worldwide RTU, training over 240 pilots in the F-16. 
In April 1983 the unit became the 16th TFS but still kept its training role, although not for beginner pilots but for higher levels of combat training. It was only fitting that as the world's first F-16 squadron that the 16th TFS received the 1,000th F-16 to come off the General Dynamics assembly line on 22 July 1983. During the three years of operational tasking the squadron continued to train and upgrade its pilots to combat ready status and to maintain the capability to deploy worldwide on short notice and employ the F-16 in the conventional air-to-air and air-to-ground combat roles. The unit became inactivated on June 30, 1986.
Modern era.
Initially there was an F-16 division within what was called the Fighter Weapons School that was created in 1982. The purpose of the school was to train aircrew in a most realistic combat environment.
Reactivated on 3 February 2003 as the 16th Weapons Squadron. The squadron is composed of block 42 and 52's. Only a few days before on 24 January 2003 the squadron officially was redesignated the 16th Weapons Squadron while working towards activation at Nellis AFB, Nevada.

Ministry of Sound Anthems

Anthems 1991-2008 is a compilation album released by Ministry of Sound in Australia and the UK. The three CD set features popular dance singles from the period of 1991-2007 (despite the '2008' in the title). It was a very successful album, and led it to become the first in a series.
UK Series.
"Anthems 1991-2008" is the first in a series of albums released by the Ministry of Sound. The series is split into three mini-series, these are "Anthems", "Chilled" and "Ibiza". There is not an official name for the series, but is often called 'Anthems' after four albums in the series and the first mini-series.
Currently, there are eight different albums in the series. The artwork scheme follows the "Fifteen Years" release of 2006, which is sometimes seen as the pre-runner to "Anthems 1991-2008". The "Ibiza 1991-2009" album notably comes in a 3-CD digipack, rather than the larger fold-away digipacks (which are contained in slipcases) used for the other seven albums. The same album is overlooked when the series is being listed in the booklet for "Anthems R&B". All copies of "Chilled Acoustic" feature a mistake in the artwork, where the top half of the Ministry of Sound logo used on the reverse side of the digipack; is upside-down.
2011 saw the year with the most releases in the series, with seven being released, four of these featuring 'Anthems' in the name. The last two Anthems albums of 2010, "Anthems Disco" and "Anthems Electronic 80s", were released only a week between each other (8 November and 15 November respectively).
Australian Series.
Like in the UK, Ministry of Sound Australia's Anthems series started with "Anthems 1991-2008", but the series in Australia is considerably smaller and less popular compared to MoSA's Sessions and Annual series. "Anthems 1991-2008" and "Anthems Electronic 80's" being the same version as what was released in the UK, however "Anthems II" in Australia didn't include the "1991-2009" subtitle and focused more on Australian dance and dance tracks that were on the ARIA charts for overall and club songs. "Rave Anthems 1990-1996" was released exclusively in Australia and focused on Rave, House and Hi-NRG dance sub-genres.

Abdirahman Farole

Abdirahman Mohamud Farole (, ) (born 1945) is a Somali politician. He served for many years in the government, acting as a governor of the Nugal region of Somalia in the 1990s and later as the Minister of Finance of the autonomous Puntland region in the northeast. From 8 January 2009 to 8 January 2014, Farole was also the President of Puntland.
Biography.
Early years.
Farole was born in 1945 in the coastal town of Eyl, situated in the northeastern Nugal region of Somalia. He hails from the Ciise Mohamud sub-clan of the Majeerteen Darod.
A multi-linguist, he is fluent in Somali, Arabic, Italian and English.
Education.
Farole first pursued his post-secondary education locally, earning a Diploma of Public Health in 1964 from the Scuola Professionale Sanitaria in Mogadishu, the nation's capital. The following year, he earned a Diploma in Statistics from the International Statistical Institute of Beirut in Lebanon.
In 1985, Farole completed a Bachelor of Commerce in Economics and Commerce from the Somali National University in Mogadishu. He followed that five years later with a Master of Business Administration (Major in Financial Management) from a joint partnership between the Somali National University-SOMTAD and the State University of New York at Albany. In 2005, he added to his resume a Bachelor of Arts (Major in Politics) from La Trobe University in Australia.
Career.
In a professional capacity, Farole worked as a senior officer/manager of major branches in Hargeisa and Berbera, and as a senior auditor/divisional manager of foreign and international departments at the Central Bank of Somalia. From 1970 to 1986, he was also director general at the Commercial & Savings Bank.
Top governmental positions Farole has held in the past include a stint as Finance Minister of the northeastern Puntland province of Somalia under the region's first president, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, and as governor of the Nugaal region in the 1990s. He later served as Planning Minister in the regional government of Mohamud "Adde" Muse Hersi, the former president of Puntland. After a falling out with Muse over a deal with the Australian oil company, Range Resources, Farole spent much of the past decade in suburban Melbourne, Australia, where he was a PhD candidate in history at La Trobe University. His dissertation was on the rebuilding of banks and financial institutions after armed conflict.
President of Puntland.
Appointment.
After having reportedly turned down requests from his fellow countrymen to run for office in the past, and with the assurance of support from various political factions, Farole returned to Somalia from Australia to present himself as a candidate in the Puntland region's 2008–2009 presidential elections. In January 2009, he defeated the nine other candidates, including incumbent President Muse, to become the fourth President of Puntland. Despite weeks of political tension prior to the vote, the election itself was also reportedly peaceful, prompting one US-based observer to suggest that the "success of the Puntland elections can begin to provide a model for the whole of Somalia." In his election victory speech, Farole vowed to tackle head-on the pervasive piracy problem off of the Somali coast, including cracking down on local authorities that were then reportedly collaborating with pirates in return for a share of the profits.
General reforms.
Since taking office in 2009, the Farole administration has implemented numerous political reforms, with an emphasis on the expansion and improvement of Puntland's security and judicial sectors. In an effort to improve transparency, the new president issued a first-ever "100 Days in Office report".
To bolster the region's justice system, numerous new prosecutors, judges and other court personnel as well as additional prison guards were hired and trained. In July 2010, the Puntland Council of Ministers unanimously approved a new anti-terrorism law to more efficiently handle terror suspects and their accomplices; a special court is also expected to be established within the region's existing criminal courts system to facilitate the task.
Fiscally, a transparent, budget-based public finance system was established, which has reportedly helped increase public confidence in government.
More modest reforms were also put into motion in the social sector, particularly in the education and healthcare fields. The regional government hired more healthcare workers and teachers, with major plans underway for school and hospital renovations.
Multi-partism.
On 15 June 2009, the Farole administration passed a new regional draft constitution, which is believed to represent a significant step toward the eventual introduction of a multi-party political system to the region for the first time. Such a system already exists in the adjacent Somaliland region.
On 15 April 2012, the Puntland government opened a four-day constitutional convention officially inaugurating the new state constitution. Overseen by the Puntland Electoral Commission (PEC), the constitution represented the final step in the extant regional democratisation process and was scheduled to be followed by the formation of political parties.
On 12 September 2012, the Puntland Election Commission announced that the registration process for political parties in Puntland was now open. This came after the passing of the Political Association Law, the Referendum Act, the District Elections Law and the inauguration of the state constitution. With District Council elections slated for early 2013, the three political organisations that have earned the most seats across 21 demarcated districts will then constitute the region's official parties. They will also be challengers in the next elections, scheduled for January 2014.
On 12 November 2012, Members of the Puntland State Parliament amended the Puntland Electoral Law after convening in the regional capital of Garowe. The amendment lowers the minimum required number of votes that each political association must secure per province from 500 to 300. It also stipulates that parties should have bureaus open in all of Puntland's eight regions.
On 14 November 2012, Farole announced the launching of his new political party, Horseed. The association counts over 200 members and represents the incumbent Puntland government, including Vice-President Abdisamad Ali Shire and the state Ministers. It is the first prospective party to register for an application with the Transitional Puntland Electoral Commission (TPEC). According to Farole, the general public will be eligible for membership in the organisation once it is selected as an official political party.
Puntland Agency For Social Welfare.
One of the most significant new reforms enacted by the incumbent Farole administration was the launching in May 2009 of the Puntland Agency for Social Welfare (PASWE), the first organisation of its kind in Somali history. The agency provides medical, educational and counselling support to vulnerable groups and individuals such as orphans, the disabled and the blind. PASWE is overseen by a board of directors, which consists of religious scholars ("ulema"), businesspeople, intellectuals and traditional elders.
Anti-piracy campaign.
Between 2009 and 2010, the Farole government enacted a number of reforms and pre-emptive measures as a part of its officially declared anti-piracy campaign. The latter include the arrest, trial and conviction of pirate gangs, as well as raids on suspected pirate hideouts and confiscation of weapons and equipment; ensuring the adequate coverage of the regional authority's anti-piracy efforts by both local and international media; sponsoring a social campaign led by Islamic scholars and community activists aimed at discrediting piracy and highlighting its negative effects; and partnering with the NATO alliance to combat pirates at sea. In May 2010, construction also began on a new naval base in the town of Bandar Siyada, located 25 km west of Bosaso, the commercial capital of Puntland. The facility is funded by Puntland's regional government in conjunction with Saracen International, a UK-based security company, and is intended to assist in more effectively combating piracy. The base will include a center for training recruits, and a command post for the naval force.
These numerous security measures appear to have borne fruit, as many pirates were apprehended in 2010, including a prominent leader. Puntland's security forces also reportedly managed to force out the pirate gangs from their traditional safe havens such as Eyl and Gar'ad, with the pirates now primarily operating from the Galmudug region to the south.
Galgala campaign.
In August 2010, Puntland security forces launched an offensive against militants led by Mohamed Said Atom, an arms-smuggler on both US and U.N. security watch-lists who had vowed war on the Farole administration. The insurgents were reportedly hiding out in the Galgala hills. Atom had fled just before the attack that left more than 100 militants dead, having reportedly misled his men prior to the Puntland army's offensive by promising reinforcements from the Islamist Al-Shabaab group via the town of Burao in the Somaliland region.
By late October, Puntland military personnel had seized the last insurgent outposts, though fighting later sporadically flared up again as militants loyal to Atom attempted to ambush Puntland soldiers.
Galmudug Accord.
In response to sporadic targeted assassination attempts by Al-Shabaab militants against Puntland public officials in the north-central city of Galkayo, the Farole administration in 2010–2011 launched a police crackdown and set in motion comprehensive administrative reform. The Puntland and Galmudug authorities subsequently signed an accord in Garowe in February 2011, officially agreeing to co-operate on security, economic and social matters so as to strengthen inter-regional relations. In April of that year, the Puntland government also replaced the Mudug region's Governor and his deputies and dissolved the local district council. A separate interim regional committee tasked with assuring security was also set up.
Puntland Maritime Police Force.
Following a Puntland-Transitional Federal Government cooperative agreement in August 2011 calling for the creation of a Somali Marine Force, of which the already established Puntland Maritime Police Force (PMPF) would form a part, the Farole administration resumed training of PMPF naval officials. The Puntland Maritime Police Force is a locally-recruited, professional maritime security force that is primarily aimed at fighting piracy off of the coast of Somalia, safeguarding the nation's marine resources, and providing logistics support to humanitarian efforts. Supported by the United Arab Emirates, PMPF officials are also trained by the Japanese Coast Guard.
Post-transition.
In February 2012, Farole and other Somali government officials met in Garowe, Puntland's administrative capital, to discuss post-transition arrangements following the end of the TFG's mandate in August 2012. After extensive deliberations attended by regional actors and international observers, the conference ended in a signed agreement between President Farole, TFG President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, Prime Minister Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, Speaker of Parliament Sharif Hassan Sheikh Aden, Galmudug President Mohamed Ahmed Alim and Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a representative Khalif Abdulkadir Noor stipulating that: a) a new 225 member bicameral parliament would be formed, consisting of an upper house seating 54 Senators as well as a lower house; b) 30% of the National Constituent Assembly (NCA) is earmarked for women; c) the President is to be appointed via a constitutional election; and d) the Prime Minister is selected by the President and he/she then names his/her Cabinet. The agreements were known as the Garowe Principles. On 23 June 2012, Farole and the Somali federal and regional leaders met again and approved a draft constitution after several days of deliberation. The new law is scheduled to be ratified by the National Constituent Assembly, with a plebiscite then expected to be held to render the bill permanent.
On 23 June 2012, the Somali federal and regional leaders met again and approved a draft constitution after several days of deliberation. The National Constituent Assembly overwhelmingly passed the new constitution on 1 August, with 96% voting for it, 2% against it, and 2% abstaining.
Term extension.
In late 2012, Farole announced his intention to extend his term as President of Puntland for one more year, pushing back regional elections to 2014. The move was met with resistance by many public officials and civilians, who asserted that he had been elected in the 2008 presidential elections to serve over a four-year period, with the next ballot scheduled to take place in January 2013. Farole argued that the new Puntland Constitution, adopted in April 2012, mandated his administration to serve a five-year-term. Street protests in connection with the term extension were held in Qardho on the eve of Farole's fourth anniversary in office, but were reportedly free of violence. Anti-riot police were also deployed in the littoral hub of Bosaso to ensure security. In his speech marking the historic day, Farole highlighted his administration's various achievements during its tenure, particularly in terms of commerce and counter-piracy operations. The remarks came after the Puntland parliament had on 7 January approved a $49 million state budget for the year, up $10.6 million from 2012's budget.
Oil exploration.
In 2012, the Farole administration gave the green light to the first official oil exploration project in Puntland and Somalia at large. Led by the Canadian oil company Africa Oil and its partner Range Resources, initial drilling in the Shabeel-1 well on Puntland's Dharoor Block in March of the year successfully yielded oil.
2014 Puntland presidential election.
In 2013, Farole ran for a second term as President of the autonomous Puntland state in the northeastern region's 2014 elections. On 8 January 2014, the first and second rounds of voting saw 9 of the 11 presidential contenders eliminated from the running, with Farole and former Prime Minister of Somalia Abdiweli Mohamed Ali left to face off in the third round. Farole initially led the final round with 31 votes, with Ali receiving 18 votes. However, a late rally by Ali saw him eventually win the election, narrowly defeating Farole by 33 votes to 32.
In his acceptance speech, Ali expressed gratitude for the opportunity as well as the work of the Farole administration. He also pledged to defend and adhere to the Puntland Constitution. For his part, Farole indicated that he accepted the outcome of the election, and felicitated Ali on his victory. Farole also reminded Ali of the responsibility now bestowed upon him as leader, urging the new President-elect to prioritise Puntland's interests and calling on all government officials, workers and security forces to co-operate with the region's new leadership.
Shortly after the announcement of the election result, President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud also described Puntland as a democratic model for the rest of the country, and thanked the outgoing regional President Farole for accepting the ballot outcome with grace and for his leadership in Puntland over the past half-decade. Describing the moment as a great day for Somalia, Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed in turn commended the Puntland authorities for ensuring that the elections were peaceful, free and fair. He also thanked President Farole for his service to Puntland.
UN Special Representative for Somalia Nicholas Kay likewise noted that Puntland was spearheading Somalia's ongoing federalisation, and hailed the region's MPs, Speaker and traditional leaders for their respective roles in the election process. He also commended former Puntland President Farole for the latter's constructive role and peaceful transfer of power. Additionally, the US Special Representative for Somalia James P. McAnulty issued a statement saluting Puntland residents for having conducted the ballot in a democratic manner. McAnulty also paid tribute to Farole for his many achievements during his tenure, including his emphasis on security and his key role in the Roadmap federal transition process.
On 14 January 2014, former Puntland President Farole officially handed over power to his successor Ali. The transfer ceremony was held at the Puntland State House in Garowe, with incumbent Puntland Vice-President Abdihakim Abdullahi Haji Omar, former Puntland Vice-President Abdisamad Ali Shire, outgoing and erstwhile Puntland cabinet ministers, the Ethiopian consul-general in the region, UNSOM officials and other international representatives in attendance. During his hand over speech, Farole recapped the accomplishments of his administration, and noted a number of infrastructural development projects in the region that were scheduled for implementation. He also thanked all members of government for having worked for the greater communal good, and pledged to assist the incoming leadership with any advice and consultations should it require them. President Ali in turn thanked the outgoing Puntland administration for its achievements, and vowed to continue and build on them. Wishing Farole well in his future endeavours, Ali also noted that his administration would benefit going forward from Farole's advice and support as a statesman.
Awards.
In January 2011, Farole was named 2010 Person of the Year by various Somali media outlets for his numerous administrative and social reforms and initiatives.

Fort Henry (Virginia)

Fort Henry was an English frontier fort in 17th century colonial Virginia near the falls of the Appomattox River. Its exact location has been debated, but the most popular one (marked by Virginia Historical Marker QA-6) is on a bluff about four blocks north of the corner of W. Washington and N. South Streets in modern-day Petersburg, Virginia. 
Fort Henry was built in 1645 by order of the House of Burgesses. It marked the 1646 treaty frontier between the white settlers and the Native Americans following the Second Anglo-Powhatan War. It was situated near the Appomattoc Indian tribe. It was the only point in Virginia where Indians could be authorized to cross eastward into white territory, or whites westward into Indian territory, from 1646 until around 1691. In later years it also came to be known as Fort Wood, after its first commander, Abraham Wood (1614-82), who sent out several exploratory expeditions from there. In 1675, command of the fort and adjacent Indian trading post passed to Wood's son-in-law, Peter Jones. The post became known as "Peter's Point", and eventually grew into modern Petersburg. At some unknown point the original fort fell into ruins. 
An earlier, smaller fort also known as Fort Henry, with a garrison of 15, had been erected in 1610 by Thomas Gates as part of a series of fortifications within modern Hampton, Virginia; this was defunct by the time the fort on the Appomattox was built.

<doc id="21345474" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21345474" title="Easy money policy">
Easy money policy

Easy money policy (or accommodative monetary policy) is a monetary policy that increases the money supply usually by lowering interest rates. It occurs when a country's central bank decides to allow cash flows to build up in the banking system. Since interest rates are lower, it is easier for banks and lenders to loan money, thus leading to increased economic growth.
Effects.
The most immediate effect of easy money is increased economic growth. However, under this policy, the value of securities rises in the short term. If prolonged, it affects the business sentiment of firms and can reverse course over fears of rampant inflation. This is an effect of forward-looking expectations.
Criticism.
As a policy, easy money underpins the economic thought of John Maynard Keynes, and has been criticized by advocates of Public choice theory, and by New Classical economists.
A study conducted by S.P. Kothari of the MIT Sloan School of Management, which looked at the growth rate of aggregated fixed investment by American companies between 1952 and 2010 found little evidence to support the notion that short term interest rates stimulate corporate investment. His findings illustrate why reducing the Fed's policy of keeping low interest rates has not had the desired effect.

Marie Wilt

Marie Wilt (also Maria Vilda and Marie Liebenthaler) (30 January 1833 – 24 September 1891) was an Austrian dramatic coloratura soprano. Possessing a wide vocal range with a significant amount of power and flexibility, Wilt sang a wide repertoire that encompassed the operas of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the German operas of Richard Wagner, the grand operas of Giuseppe Verdi, and the bel canto operas of Bellini, Rossini, and Donizetti. She sang for many years at the Vienna Hofoper (now Vienna State Opera) and for a number of seasons at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London. She notably portrayed the role of Sulamith in the world premiere of Karl Goldmark's "Die Königin von Saba" in 1875. Also a regular performer of the concert repertoire, Wilt often appeared in performances of works by Beethoven, Haydn, and Mendelssohn.
Biography.
Early life and education.
Born in Vienna, with the name Marie Liebenthaler, Wilt was orphaned as a young child and adopted by a family with the surname Tremier. Beginning in her teenage years, she sang in choirs in Vienna and occasionally appeared as a soloist. She married Franz Wilt, a banker, in 1855 and for the next several years worked as a housewife while still singing in choirs. She joined the Wiener Singakademie in 1858 and drew the attention of its director, Johann von Herbeck, who gave her solos in the oratorios and other large works the ensemble performed. Under Herbeck's persuasion and the influence of Belgian soprano Désirée Artôt she began to study singing with Joseph Gänsbacher.
Career and later life.
Wilt made her professional opera début as Donna Anna in Mozart's "Don Giovanni" with Oper Graz in 1865. She repeated the role later that year at the Berlin State Opera, but had to leave the production in the middle of the opera's run due to carbon monoxide poisoning. The following year she went to England to join the roster at the Covent Garden where she sang roles for two seasons under the name Maria Vilda. She most notably sang the title role in Bellini's "Norma" while she was in London. She also appeared in Venice in November 1866.
In 1867 Wilt returned to Austria to join the roster at the Vienna Hofoper where she sang roles for the next decade. Her first role at the opera house was Leonora in Verdi's "Il trovatore". She notably portrayed the role of Donna Elvira in Mozart's "Don Giovanni" for the opening of Vienna's new opera house in 1869. She also sang the title role in Verdi's "Aida" for the Austrian premiere of that opera in 1874 and portrayed the role of Sulamith in the world premiere of Karl Goldmark's "Die Königin von Saba" in 1875. Her other roles with the company included the Queen of the Night in Mozart's "The Magic Flute", bel canto operas by Donizetti and Bellini, and several Wagner and Verdi heroines among others.
While singing with the Vienna Hofoper, Wilt also traveled periodically throughout Europe to appear as a guest artist in numerous operas and concerts. She was particularly admired for her performances of the soprano solos in Verdi's "Requiem", Beethoven's "9th symphony", Beethoven's "Missa solemnis", and the concert works of Haydn and Mendelssohn. She sang in concerts and operas in Frankfurt and Mannheim in 1868, Prague in 1869, and Riga in 1871. In 1873 she sang in concerts at the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in Düsseldorf and Aachen, and in Bonn for the celebration Robert Schumann. Wilt returned to Covent Garden in both 1874 and 1875 to appear in several productions with the company, including: Marguerite de Valois in Giacomo Meyerbeer's "Les Huguenots", the title role in Donizetti's "Lucrezia Borgia", Alice in Donizetti's "Robert le diable", and the title role in Rossini's "Semiramide". 
Wilt left the Vienna Hofoper in 1877 and moved to Leipzig. While there she sang the role of Brünnhilde in one of the first complete performances of Richard Wagner's "Der Ring des Nibelungen" ("The Ring Cycle") under conductor Anton Seidl. She joinded the Opern- und Schauspielhaus Frankfurt in 1880 for their first season, opening their new opera house with the role of Donna Anna. She left Frankfurt in 1882 and spent the next four years singing in Budapest and Brünn. She returned to the Vienna Hofoper in 1886 and the following year reprised the role of Donna Elvira at the Salzburg Festival for the centenary performance of "Don Giovanni".
Wilt retired from the operatic stage in 1890 and, now a widow, moved to Graz to live with her daughter, Mrs. Gottinger. She fell in love with a younger man who ended up breaking her heart. The end of the romance threw her into a deep depression and she committed suicide by jumping from the window of the fourth floor of a hotel in Vienna.

About You Now (EP)

About You Now is the debut solo remix extended play (EP) by American actress and singer Miranda Cosgrove, released by Columbia Records and Nickelodeon Records to iTunes on February 3, 2009. The extended play was released as a promotional tool, and was not to be taken as her official musical debut. The album was used to promote Cosgrove's single of the same name, released in the final quarter of 2008. Aside from featuring remixes of previous promotional singles of Cosgrove's, the album also featured two tracks, "FYI" and "Party Girl". It is a cover of the Sugababes hit single of the same name.
Due to only being released on promotional terms, the album failed to gain any attention, and failed to chart on any charts worldwide. It did, however, help boost sales of the single, "About You Now". The single became Cosgrove's second song to chart on "Billboard's" Hot 100 singles chart, peaking at number 47, her highest peak to date. The single also became her first single to chart internationally, peaking at number 79 in the United Kingdom.
Cosgrove promoted the single and the accompanying album mainly through interviews and performances. Cosgrove performed "About You Now" at the 2009 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The single was also performed on "The Today Show", along with some of Cosgrove's songs from her official debut studio album, "Sparks Fly". The other songs were the lead single, "Kissin U", as well as the album's second track, "BAM".
Background and development.
Cosgrove's musical career first began with her recording the theme song of the Nickelodeon television series "iCarly" called "Leave It All to Me," on which Cosgrove stars as the title character on the show. The song features her former "Drake and Josh" cast mate Drake Bell, and was written by Michael Corcoran, one of Bell's band members. Following the success of "iCarly", Columbia Records released a soundtrack album of the show on June 10, 2008. The soundtrack album included four songs recorded by Cosgrove that were "Leave It All to Me", "Stay My Baby", "About You Now" and "Headphones On". Cosgrove stated, "Before that, I didn't see myself making an album, but when I spent time in the studio doing the theme song and saw how much fun it was, I wanted to go back."
In July 2008, she officially announced plans for a debut album, stating that the album was "different" from her contributions to the "iCarly" soundtrack, with her "co-writing and getting really into it," and saying that "playing a character on "iCarly", but this shows more of myself. Some people might think I'm just another actress putting out an album, but I wanted to prove that I'm more than that." The album took two years to make, with Columbia Records' marketing manager Chris Poppe stating in May 2010 that "Miranda started working on [the album at 14, and she's 16 now. The difference between those two ages is huge, and the songs have had to grow along with her." On February 5, 2009, Cosgrove released her debut solo recording; the 5-song EP "About You Now" exclusively onto the iTunes Store. The EP included the title track "About You Now", a remix of it, a remix of "Stay My Baby", "F.Y.I." and "Party Girl".
Composition.
The first track on the album is "About You Now". Musically, the song is a mid-tempo pop-rock track, that follows a verse to chorus guideline. The song, a cover of the Sugababes hit single, lyrically speaks of a girl who is over a fight her and her intimate other had, and now knows how she feels "about him now." The single has proven to be a hit for Cosgrove in the US. On the "Billboard" Hot 100, the single is her highest peaking so to date, currently holding a peak of number 47. The single has also been her most successful in the United Kingdom, where it debuted and peaked at number 97. "About You Now" was also featured on the hit compilation album, "Now That's What I Call Music! 30". "FYI" is the second song on the album. Musically, the song is an uptempo punk rock type of song, that lyrically speaks of Cosgrove's romantic feelings for someone, and the song follows Cosgrove expressing her feelings for him in the lyrics. "Party Girl", the third track on the album, has more of a pop feel than the rest of the album. Musically, it is an uptemp pop song, that lyrically speaks of Cosgrove's longing to party and hang out with her friends. 
Also included on the extended play are two remixes. The first of these is the spider remix of "Stay My Baby", a promotional single recently released by Cosgrove from the soundtrack to her "iCarly" television series. The song, originally a ballad, has now been given a pop and dance beat. Lyrically, the song speaks of Cosgrove knowing that everything will be okay, as long as he "stays her baby." The final track on the album is the Spider Remix of "About You Now". The new version of the album has removed the guitar from the song and replaced it with more of an electropop type of sound.
Critical reception.
Commonsensemedia stated that "While Cosgrove's acting career has advanced considerably, her singing sounds similar to her passable vocal performance in School of Rock. Problem is, that was six years ago, when Cosgrove was nine years old. As a result, the synth-pop pattern that pervades so much of today's tween music doesn't come across as well for Cosgrove as it does for other bubblegum popsters with slightly stronger voices, like Miley Cyrus and Jordan McCoy. No doubt her TV popularity will still draw fans to this EP, but the release won't go down as one of the better ones in tween-music history." In their review of the album, The Daily Vault stated "As it turns out, Cosgrove is tackling non-tween material, trying to convince her adult listeners she’s not as young as you might think. She wants to go back in time to a previous point in her relationship with the subject in the disc’s title track since she “knows how I feel about you now.” She sings about how girls “dig rejection” and how she’d rather “rock, that’s how I roll” in “FYI.” Finally, in the third original track on this EP, she spouts on and on about how “you can take the rock out of the roll but you can’t take the party out of the girl” in “Party Girl.” Finally, in “Stay My Baby,” she speculates about being in a long distance relationship when “she’s back at school,” which I infer as being college? So, Cosgrove is tackling adult problems while singing to a tween audience."
Promotion and performances.
The song "About You Now" was first performed live during the 2009 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The performance saw Cosgrove singing the song while on a float. During the Summer of 2010, Cosgrove embarked on a radio promotional tour, and has made appearances at radio concerts. On September 6, 2010, she performed "Kissin U", "BAM", which was written and produced by Rock Mafia and Darkchild, and "About You Now", which is a cover, co-written by Cathy Dennis and Dr. Luke who produced it and was originally recorded by the Sugababes and released as a single on their fifth studio album "Change", on "The Today Show". 
Cosgrove headlined her own tour, titled "Dancing Crazy Tour" which is named after Cosgrove's new single "Dancing Crazy" co-written by Avril Lavigne and Max Martin and Shellback, who produced it and will be released on Cosgrove's second EP "High Maintenance", released on March 15, 2011. The tour began January 24, 2011 and ended February 24, 2011. The tour featured dates in House of Blues locations such as ones located in Houston, TX and Anaheim, CA. She also performed at several theatres on the tour including locations in cities such as Atlanta, GA, Tampa, FL and Orlando FL. Accompanying Cosgrove on the tour was Greyson Chance, who rose to fame when a video of him singing "Paparazzi" by Lady Gaga emerged on popular video sharing website YouTube. Chance performed several of his own original songs, as well as covers from famous artists. The tour was financially successful. The second show on the tour, which took place in Minneapolis, sold about 54% of its tickets. The shows total gross revenue was $37,256. The fourth show of the tour, which took place in Rosemont, Illinois, was much more successful, selling 90% of the available tickets. The total gross revenue for the show was $118,435.
"About You Now" is one of the tracks in the Japanese edition of Cosgrove's debut album "Sparks Fly".

1688 Germantown Quaker Petition Against Slavery

The 1688 Germantown Quaker Petition Against Slavery was the first protest against African-American slavery made by a religious body in the English colonies. It was drafted by Francis Daniel Pastorius and signed by him and three other Quakers living in Germantown, Pennsylvania (now part of Philadelphia) on behalf of the Germantown Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends. It was forwarded to the monthly, quarterly, and yearly meetings without any action being taken on it. According to John Greenleaf Whittier, the original document was discovered in 1844 by the Philadelphia antiquarian Nathan Kite and published in "The Friend" (Vol. XVIII, No. 16).
Historical background.
Pennsylvania was founded in 1682 by William Penn as an English colony where people from any country and faith could settle, free from religious persecution. In payment of a debt to Penn's father, Penn had received from King Charles II of England a large land grant west of New Jersey which King Charles II of England named Pennsylvania after William's father, Admiral Penn. Penn had become a friend of George Fox, the founder of the Society of Friends, called Quakers after their unique way of speaking in Meeting for Worship. Penn had converted to Quakerism and had been imprisoned several times for his beliefs. The king allowed Penn to establish a proprietary colony where Penn appointed the governor and judges but established an otherwise democratic system of government with freedom of religion, fair trials, elected representatives, and separation of church and state.
In the period 1660 to 1680, several Quakers including William Penn visited the Netherlands and the Rhine valley of what would later become Germany, and organized gatherings where they preached the Quaker testimony. Many people, including some who had been Mennonites in Krefeld and Kriegsheim (now part of the modern Mennonite congregation of Monsheim, Germany), in the German "Palatinate", converted to the new Quaker faith. Among them was Francis Daniel Pastorius, a young German born near Würzburg to a family of elite officeholders. After training as an attorney, Pastorius sought spiritual release from his lucrative but uninspiring practice with the local gentry, and he turned inward looking for a philosophical purity in his life. He was attracted to Penn's colony as a place where religious freedom would allow him to start afresh a life free from "libertinism and sins of the European world." Meanwhile, the Mennonites and Quakers in Holland and along the Rhine valley were often imprisoned for belonging to a faith other than the officially recognized Catholicism and Lutheranism.
In 1681, Penn invited people from his native England and from other European countries to the new colony. He arrived in 1682, had the land surveyed, organized Philadelphia as a welcoming town laid out as a grid with many green spaces, and profited by selling lots. Soon, the waterfront was a bustle of activity, town streets were laid out with houses built on narrow lots, and churches of several different faiths were established. The town merchants traded with the largely Quaker colony of West Jersey. The town and surrounding countryside prospered.
The German settlement.
In 1683 Pastorius was delegated authority to purchase land in the new Pennsylvania colony by a group of men from Frankfurt who intended to emigrate. He traveled to Philadelphia in August 1683, having purchased a warrant from Penn's agent on behalf of the Frankfurt men who had supplied the funds. In October, 1683, thirteen German-Dutch families from Krefeld in the Rhine valley arrived with their own land claim. Seizing upon a chance to create a viable German-speaking town, Pastorius negotiated with Penn to combine the two claims. As it turned out, the people from the Frankfurt Company never emigrated to the new colony, but more Quakers and Mennonites came from the Rhine valley and Pastorius's ambitious plan for a German-speaking town near Philadelphia grew and became real.
Pastorius had devised a simple plan for a town, with lots parceled out along one long main thoroughfare, where settlers could build their houses. He required land good for tilling because the emigrants would need to grow their own food to survive. Pastorius and Penn became good friends, and they often discussed plans for the new settlement over dinner. The land originally promised to Pastorius was supposed to be level and along a navigable river, and Pastorius had paid for . However a suitable tract of land near Philadelphia was unavailable on the Delaware River, because level ground there was valuable and most of it had already been sold. Penn suggested land near the Schuylkill Falls (East Falls), but it was too steep for Pastorius's plan, so as an alternative Penn suggested land a little further east, near the top of a gentle hill between two creeks, and Pastorius agreed. Germantown was thus founded along a Lenni Lenape trail four miles (6 km) north of Philadelphia, between the Wissahickon and Wingohocking creeks. Pastorius had the land surveyed, and over the first winter the families lived in downtown Philadelphia while struggling to clear the land for their makeshift log houses. Germantown became a separate and self-sufficient town of Dutch and German speakers.
The thirteen original Krefelder families were Mennonites who had become Quakers in their native Holland before they arrived in the new Pennsylvania colony. Because they had been persecuted in their own land on account of their beliefs they understood the value of a community founded on religious toleration. Unlike Pastorius, they were not wealthy, but were skilled craftsmen who knew they would have to work hard for a living. By trade they were carpenters, weavers, dyers, tailors, and shoemakers, so they were not fully prepared for the hard work of clearing the forest. Over the first year they cleared land and planted crops for food and flax for weaving. They set up looms and soon were producing linen cloth that sold widely throughout the colonies.
The issue of slavery.
Some of the early English settlers of Philadelphia and its surrounding towns were wealthy and purchased slaves to work on their farms. Although many such slaveowners also had immigrated to escape religious persecution, they saw no contradiction in owning slaves, because serfdom, slavery and servitude had existed in Europe since the Middle Ages. Although serfdom was abolished in northwestern Europe by 1500, servitude was ubiquitous in Europe, sometimes under harsh conditions. Many immigrants to the new colony were indentured servants, working for several years in exchange for being carried on a boat to the new colony. Slaves were widely owned in the colonies and local slave markets made purchasing slaves easy. The slave trade was protected by the British crown and some thought it necessary for economic growth in the colonies. It was justified by racism and intolerance towards what many British saw as "uncivilized" cultures. Many ship owners and captains made large profits carrying slaves from Africa to the Caribbean islands and the mainland colonies. William Penn oversaw the economic progress of his colony and once proudly declared that during the course of a year Philadelphia had received 10 slave ships.
The first settlers of Germantown were soon joined by several more Quaker and Mennonite families from Krisheim, also in the Rhine valley, who were ethnic Germans but spoke a similar dialect to the Hollanders from Krefeld. Some out of pragmatism attended the local Quaker Meetings held in the newly built homes of immigrants, becoming involved and accepted in the Philadelphia Quaker community, and eventually joining as members. However, in several ways they felt themselves outsiders, which allowed them to see and question what the English could not. Some attended the Quaker Meeting temporarily while they waited for a Mennonite minister to arrive, and then helped to build the first Mennonite Meetinghouse. The town prospered and grew, and a Quaker Meeting was organized at Thones Kunders's house, under the care of Dublin (Abington Meeting). By 1686 a Quaker Meetinghouse was constructed near the current site of Germantown Friends Meeting.
The German-Dutch settlers were unaccustomed to slaves, although from the shortage of labor they understood why their British neighbors relied on slaves for prosperity. Slaves and indentured servants were a valuable asset for a farmer because they were not paid. Yet the German-Dutch settlers refused to buy slaves themselves and quickly saw the contradiction in the slave trade and in farmers who forced people to work. Although in their native Germany and Holland the Krefelders had been persecuted because of their beliefs, only people who had been convicted of a crime could be forced to work in servitude. In what turned out to be a revolutionary leap of insight, the Germantowners saw a fundamental similarity between the right to be free from persecution on account of their beliefs and the right to be free from being forced to work against their will.
About the contents of the petition.
In 1688, five years after Germantown was founded, Pastorius and three other men petitioned the Dublin Quaker Meeting. The men gathered at Thones Kunders's house and wrote a petition based upon the Bible's Golden Rule, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you," urging the Meeting to abolish slavery. It is an unconventional text in that it avoids the expected salutation to fellow Quakers and does not contain references to Jesus and God. It argues that every human, regardless of belief, color, or ethnicity, has rights that should not be violated.
Throughout the petition the reference to the Golden Rule is used to argue against slavery and for universal human rights. On first reading, the argument presented in the petition seems indirect. Nowhere is the Meeting specifically asked to condemn the practice of slavery. Instead, in reference to the Golden Rule, the four men ask why Christians are allowed to buy and own slaves, almost in mock sarcasm, to get the slaveowners to see their point. In doing so, it arguably was very successful, but it would be easy to miss the sophistication of their argument. They emphatically argue that in their society the capture and sale of ordinary people as slaves, where husband, wife and children are separated, would not be tolerated, again referring to the Golden Rule.
The four men also assert that according to the Golden Rule, the slaves would have the right to revolt, and that inviting more people to the new land would be difficult if prospective settlers saw the contradiction inherent in slavery. In mentioning the possibility of a slave revolt, they clearly were suggesting to the English colonists that slavery would discourage potential settlers from emigrating. In the Caribbean colonies there had been many slave revolts over several decades, so the possibility was real. However, the power of the argument for potential settlers from Europe was more than the fear of a revolt—it was that any such revolt would be justifiable according to the Golden Rule. This logic strengthened the newly defined universal rights, which applied to all humans, not just the "civilized". The petition has several examples of such counter-intuitive but forceful arguments to push the slave-owning reader off his balance.
The petition contains several points of difficulty for the reader unfamiliar with history. First, the petition's grammar seems unusual today but reflects the Krefelders' incomplete knowledge of English as well as typical pre-modern use of variable spelling. The original wording includes "ye." which is a contraction of the word "the", and might be confused with the second person plural "ye" that was in wide use at the time.
Second, the petition mentions Turks as an example of a people who might take someone on a ship into slavery in their native Turkey. The four men were referring to the widely known stories of Barbary pirates who had established outposts on the coast of North Africa and for hundreds of years had plundered ships. After the Moors were driven out of Spain in 1492 they raided the Spanish coast and the Spanish countered with more attacks. The Barbary pirates in the period (1518–1587) were allied with the empire in Constantinople and captured slaves to be brought back to North Africa or Turkey. Thus in their early period, their motivation was political. In the later period during the 17th century the North African pirate communities became more independent and lived mainly on plunder so the motivation for piracy was mainly economic. In that period up to 20,000 captured Christians were said to be kept as slaves in Algiers. The slave raiders traveled throughout the Mediterranean Sea and the North Atlantic, often taking slaves from Italy and Spain, but ranging as far north as Iceland (see Sack of Baltimore etc.). Among the Barbary pirates were renegade individuals from Europe including England and Holland. Some English, French, and Germans were allowed to pay their way out of slavery and so brought back the stories of marauding pirates capturing slaves.
The petition's mention of this point, then, is another example of their sophisticated reasoning. The widely circulated stories of slavery on the Barbary Coast were true, for Europeans had been the prey of political enemies and renegades who had captured them as slaves. Indeed, in the year that the Petition was written, a number of Quakers were enslaved in Morocco. This analogy in the first paragraph of the petition cast the taking of slaves by the English in a questionable light. The four men were claiming that slaves had social and political equality with ordinary citizens.
Third, the petition refers to the black slaves as "negers", which was a German word meaning black or negro. In its 1688 usage the term was simply descriptive and not in any way derogatory. Throughout the petition the four men show respect for enslaved people and declare them equals.
The effect of the document.
The four men presented their petition at the local Monthly Meeting at Dublin (Abington), but it is not clear what they expected to happen. Although they were accepted in the Quaker community, they were outsiders who could not speak or write fluently in English, and they also had a fresh view of slavery that was unique to Germantown. They must have understood from the beginning that it would be difficult to force the whole colony to abolish slavery, as it was generally believed that the colony's prosperity depended on slavery. It is not clear whether the four men expected the local Meeting to affirm their view, because they knew that nearby Meetings might not in be in agreement, and consequences would be far-reaching. The Meeting decided that although the issue was fundamental and just, it was too difficult and consequential for them to judge, and would need to be considered further. In the usual manner the Meeting sent the petition on to the Philadelphia Quarterly Meeting, where it was again considered and sent on to the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting (held in Burlington, NJ). Realizing that the abolition of slavery would have a wide and overreaching impact on the entire colony, none of the Meetings wanted to pass judgment on such a "weighty matter." PYM minuted that they would send the petition to London Yearly Meeting, without mentioning whether they actually did so, and on this point no direct evidence has been discovered. The minutes of London Yearly Meeting do not mention the petition directly, apparently skirting the issue.
The practice of slavery continued and was tolerated in Quaker society in the years immediately following the 1688 petition. Some of the authors continued to protest against slavery, but for a decade their efforts were rejected. Germantown continued to prosper, growing in population and economic strength, becoming widely known for the quality of its products such as paper and woven cloth. Eventually several of the original Krefelders rejoined the Mennonites and moved away from Germantown at least in part because of their insistence not to side with slave-owners. Several other petitions and protests were written by Quakers against slavery in the next several decades, but were based on racist or practical arguments of inferiority and intolerance. Some of the protests became entangled with politics and theology and as a result were dismissed by the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, confusing the issue. Almost three decades passed before another Quaker petition against slavery was written with sophistication comparable to the Germantown 1688 petition. But the Germantowners' condemnation of slavery continued, and their moral leadership on the issue influenced Quaker abolitionists and Philadelphia society.
Gradually over the next century, due to the efforts of many dedicated Quakers such as Benjamin Lay, John Woolman, and Anthony Benezet, Quakers became convinced of the essential wrongness of the institution of slavery. Many of the Quaker abolitionists published their articles anonymously in Benjamin Franklin's newspaper. In 1776 a proclamation was written by Philadelphia Yearly Meeting banning the owning of slaves. By that time, many Quaker monthly meetings in the Delaware Valley were attempting to help freed slaves by providing funds for them to start businesses and encouraging them to attend Quaker meetings and educate their children.
Historical and social importance.
The 1688 petition was the first American document of its kind that made a plea for equal human rights for everyone. It compelled a higher standard of reasoning about fairness and equality that continued to grow in Pennsylvania and the other colonies with the Declaration of Independence and the abolitionist and suffrage movements, eventually giving rise to Lincoln's reference to human rights in the Gettysburg Address. The 1688 petition was set aside and forgotten until 1844 when it was re-discovered and became a focus of the burgeoning abolitionist movement in the United States. After a century of public exposure, it was misplaced and once more re-discovered in March 2005 in the vault at Arch Street Meetinghouse. It was discovered in deteriorating condition, with tears at the edges, paper tape covering voids and handwriting where the petition had originally been folded, and its oak gall ink slowly fading into gray. To preserve the document for future generations, it was treated at the Conservation Center for Art and Historic Artifacts (CCAHA) in downtown Philadelphia. CCAHA conservator Morgan Zinsmeister removed previous repairs and reduced centuries of old and discolored adhesives with various poultices and enzymatic solutions. Acidity and discoloration in the paper were reduced through aqueous treatment. Repairs were made with acrylic-toned Japanese papers that were carefully applied to bridge the voids. Finally, the petition was photographed at high resolution and then encapsulated along its edges(not laminated) between sheets of inert polyester film. The petition was shown at an exhibit of original rare American documents at the National Constitution Center on Independence Mall in the summer of 2007. It currently resides at Haverford College Quaker and Special Collections, the joint repository (with Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College) for the records of Philadelphia Yearly Meeting. Today the 1688 petition is for many a powerful reminder about the basis for freedom and equality for all.
In a world where slavery continues in many forms, the 1688 petition seems relevant to many people because of its statement on the nature of human suffering and institutions that conspire to continue injustice based on power and tradition. In many countries today people have been reported to be duped into being taken to foreign lands where they are held under difficult conditions and forced to work with meager pay. The power of economic progress has in some cases created conditions where those with less education and resources are convinced to travel from familiar surroundings and feel threatened not to complain for fear of losing their work. Ethnic minorities and women of many third-world countries are especially vulnerable. Societies that are sometimes called "advanced" are to some extent dependent on cheap labor and resources taken from those less fortunate. Some believe that our worldwide environmental crisis has been created by our willingness to ignore the pleas and lost lives of people who would work hard for equal pay and privilege. The expectation of equal rights for everyone is a powerful motivator that may help to give economic progress and environmental responsibility worldwide.

Jerzy and Irena Krępeć

Jerzy and Irena Krępeć, a Polish husband and wife, living in Gołąbki near Warsaw during Nazi German occupation of Poland in World War II, were the Righteous who rescued Polish Jews with families including refugees from the Ghetto in Warsaw during the Holocaust. 
The ceremonies.
Jerzy and Irena Krępeć were bestowed the titles of Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem on April 18, 1994. Their medals of honor were presented to a widowed Irena Krępeć by the Israeli Consul General in Canada Daniel Gal, during the ceremony at the Israeli consulate in Montreal, on December 12, 1995 in the presence of the Polish Consul General Małgorzata Dzieduszycki, and the French and English press. 
Daniel Gal explained in his speech that the Holocaust survivors pleaded on behalf of the entire Krępeć family with all its members and that Yad Vashem honored Jerzy and Irena first. Subsequently, their son, Tadeusz living in Montreal, and Jerzy’s two sisters, Eugenia Krępeć–Muszyński and Alina (Halina) Krępeć–Tyszka, were recognized as Righteous in May and November 2002, with more testimonies by their Jewish countrymen. Eugenia’s daughter, Aleksandra Muszyński however, refused to be recognized. The ceremony was written about in 12 newspaper articles in three languages. "My father never sought recognition or compensation for what he did," said André Krepec — the eldest son of Tadeusz Krepec — who attended the forum together with his widowed mother Halina, three brothers, sister, and their families. "For him, it was just a question of human values…"
The rescuers and the rescued.
Following the 1939 invasion of Poland, Jerzy Krępeć (1896–1981) and Irena "née " Adamus (1906–17.11.1999), were forced out by the Nazis from their estate near Płock. They moved to Gołąbki near Warsaw with their three children: Tadeusz (14), Krystyna (13) and Maria (9), and rented a farm called Osada not far from where Irena’s parents lived. Soon they began to take in Jews who escaped from Nazi persecution. Among them: Krystyna Izbicki, Anna Zofia and her son Jozef Ettinger, Krystyna Radziejewski and her foster-daughter Larissa Sztorchan, Czeslawa Konko (children's instructor), Zofia Sidor, her sisters, Eliza Temler and Dr. Tworkowski. More than 20 Jewish refugees joined in after the Warsaw Uprising. They all worked at the farm and in the fields to maintain food supplies and also, for their own cover. Children, both Christian and Jewish, attended classes at an underground school set up by the family.
Jerzy Krępeć rented a second farm nearby where he placed his two sisters: Alina Tyszka (with daughters, Marta and Stefa) and Eugenia Muszynski with her teenage daughter Olenka (14). Alina Tyszka was expelled from her estate near Bydgoszcz (which was incorporated into the 3rd Reich). Her husband Feliks, a Polish officer, was executed by the Nazis with his two uncles. Alina escaped when threatened with arrest, because of her earlier assistance given to Jews at a forced labor camp in Bielin where she worked in 1941. Eugenia's husband was held as a Polish POW in Germany. The two sisters immediately began sheltering more Jews. They all worked together at the farm. Their older children, especially Tadeusz and Olenka helped. The Jews moved from one farm to the other in case of danger. Some received false identification cards thanks to Jerzy's underground contacts, which was good also for their morale. 
The entire Krepec family helped everybody in need with shelter, food, clothing and moral support. People in the village knew about the numerous Jewish families living at both farms, but nobody betrayed them and all refugees survived. Indeed, Jerzy Krepec had many silent partners, including neighbors well aware of the succession of farmhands speaking Polish with an accent. Undeterred by the associated risk, Tadeusz Krepec used to sneak out at night and steal guns and grenades from the German Panzer division stationed nearby, then bury them at the farm for the Polish Underground. 
After the war, the Krepec family kept in touch with the Jewish friends who had stayed with them during the occupation. They were receiving shipments of oranges from Israel, however, they would not accept the offer to help emigrate from their homeland. Their son, Tadeusz Krepec, who studied at the Warsaw Polytechnic eventually came to Montreal in 1973 as an engineer.

Adolfo Kind

Adolf respectively Adolfo Kind (1848, Chur – August 1907) was a Swiss chemical engineer and one of the fathers of Italian skiing.
Life.
Kind was a member of an old Walser family which had been living in Chur for more than four centuries. When his father was appointed pastor of the Evangelic Church the family went to Milan but they removed to Switzerland at the beginning of the Sardinian War in 1859 where they lived in Graubünden. Afterwards Kind studied chemical engineering in Munich und Zürich and went back to Italy in 1879 where he worked in the direction of a candle and soap company. He started a family and went to Turin in 1890 where he worked in a candle wick company. In turin the family and its friends sparked interests for skies from Glarus. Kind started the import to the city since 1896 and so the Kinds and their friends got the kernel of skiing pioneers in Italy. They were concerned with developing and improving of the ascending and skiing down techniques and inspired an increasing number of skiing fans in the region. Kind, Luciano Roiti, Ottorino Mezzalama and some other friends were members of the Club Alpino Italiano (CAI). On his impulse the Italian alpine club founded the Ski Club Torino in 1901, where he was the first president until 1907, and two further ones in Genoa and Milan.
Kind was a numbered member of the Club Alpino Accademico Italiano (CAAI) which cooperated with the skiing club of Turin since 1904. He met with an accident in a tragical way on the ascent to Piz Bernina in 1907. His son Paolo Kind founded the "Unione Ski Club Italiani" in 1908 which passed into the FISI.

Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town

The Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town is both a federally recognized Native American tribe and a traditional township of Muskogean-speaking Alabama and Coushatta (also known as Quassarte) peoples. Their traditional languages include Alabama, Koasati, and Mvskoke. The tribe includes 380 enrolled members, of which 324 live within the state of Oklahoma. 
Other federally recognized Coushatta tribes are the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana and the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas. Two other Muscogee tribal towns are federally recognized, and 40 tribal towns, or "talwa", remain enrolled in the Muscogee Creek Nation.
Government.
The Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town is headquartered in Wetumka, Oklahoma. Its tribal jurisdictional area, as opposed to a reservation, spans Creek, Hughes, Mayes, McIntosh, Muskogee, Okfuskee, Okmulgee, Rogers, Seminole, Tulsa, and Wagoner counties in Oklahoma. 
The Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town is governed by a chief, second chief, secretary, floor speaker, solicitor, chairman of the governing committee, and the governing committee itself, with twelve elected members. Tarpie Yargee is the elected chief, currently serving a four-year term.
Tribal enrollment is based on lineal descent from 1890 and 1895 tribal rolls and does not require a minimum blood quantum. 
The tribe maintains a close relationship with the Muscogee Creek Nation and falls under the jurisdiction of their tribal courts. Some members are dually enrolled in the Muscogee Nation.
Economic development.
The Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town operates a tribal housing program, a smoke shop, and a casino, the Red Hawk Gaming Center in Wetumka.
History.
The Quassarte and Alabama were originally two distinct tribes, who both lived on the banks of the Alabama River from Mobile, Alabama to the upper reaches of the river. Both the river and the state are named after the Alabama. The Quassarte are also known as the Coushatta or "Koasati", in their own language.
The two tribes shared many similarities in their languages and culture, as they were both Muskogean speaking. In the early 17th century, after a conflict with French settlers, the tribes formed an alliance. They intermarried freely and became active trading partners. In 1763, the two tribes joined the Muscogee Nation Confederacy (also called the Creek Confederacy).
Before removal of the Muscogee Creek people from Alabama in the 1830s, the Muscogee Nation Confederacy included over 44 different tribal towns. The Alabama and Quassarte peoples made up six to eight of those towns. Facing increasing encroachment by European-American settlers, some of the Quassarte and Alabama peoples moved into Louisiana and Texas in the late 18th century and early 19th century. These emigrants formed what are today the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana and the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas. Those who stayed in Alabama joined forces and became a single town.
The Indian Removal Act of 1830 forced the tribal town, along with the rest of the Muscogee, to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. They settled in what would become Hughes, McIntosh, Okfuskee, and Seminole Counties. The Dawes Allotment Act of 1887 and the Curtis Act of 1898, intended to increase assimilation, provided for allotments of land to individual households from the communal reservation lands and sale of the "surplus"; in addition, it required the extinguishing of tribal governments and courts. The Bureau of Indian Affairs took an increased role on the reservations. 
The Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town still maintained its cultural identity and kept traditional dances and beliefs alive at the Alabama Ceremonial Grounds near Wetumka. Other Native American peoples also survived culturally and preserved their religious practices. The town took the opportunity afforded by the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act of 1936; it organized as a distinct, federally recognized tribe in April 1939. Due to its historic relationship with the Muscogee Creek Nation, tribal members can maintain dual citizenship in both tribes.

1962 Lombank Trophy

The 3rd Lombank Trophy was a motor race, run to Formula One rules, held on 14 April 1962 at Snetterton Motor Racing Circuit, England. The race was run over 50 laps of the circuit, and was won by British driver Jim Clark in a Lotus 24. 
After Graham Hill had led for the first five laps, Stirling Moss passed him and stretched ahead, his car using the new Coventry Climax V8 engine. However, he experienced throttle problems after 17 laps and had to make a number of pitstops, leaving Clark to dominate the rest of the race. Clark's car was the only other Climax-engined runner to use the new V8 engine.
Prior to the race, two of the entrants withdrew after accidents: Richie Ginther crashed his BRM P57 in testing and suffered injuries which left him unable to race, and Jack Brabham's Lotus 21 had been damaged in a fire at his workshop.

<doc id="21345902" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21345902" title="School Prayer Amendment">
School Prayer Amendment

The School Prayer Amendment is a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution intended by its proponents to legislatively overturn certain Constitutional prohibitions against government sponsored prayer, including at public schools. Those prohibitions, which vary according to the setting in which a prayer may be offered, arise out of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and specifically the Establishment Clause. The interpretation of the Establishment Clause is particularly strict when it comes to primary and secondary public schools, and prohibits prayer that appears to have the imprimatur of the administration on it. Those who believe that schools should be able to require students to join in a group prayer seek an amendment to the Constitution to remove the prohibitions created by the First Amendment. 
Background.
In the cases "Engel v. Vitale" (1962) and "Abington School District v. Schempp" (1963), the United States Supreme Court ruled that government mandated school prayer is unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. 
History.
Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia proposed the amendment in 1962, 1973, 1979, 1982, 1993, 1995, and 1997. 
"The New York Times" reported in July 1999 that the House of Representatives, at that time occupied by a Republican majority, had long been proposing such an amendment but was preoccupied with a competing, more general amendment allowing for "religious freedoms" proposed by Henry Hyde, then-Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Representative Ernest Istook, a Republican from Oklahoma's 5th congressional district, proposed the amendment on May 8, 1997. In March 1998, the Judiciary Committee passed the bill by a 16-11 vote. On June 4, 1998, the full House voted on the amendment, 224-203 in favor. The vote was 61 short of the two-thirds majority required by Article Five of the United States Constitution to pass a constitutional amendment.
Istook reintroduced the amendment to Congress twice: first in 1999 as the House Joint Resolution 66 and in 2001 as the "Religious Speech Amendment". Byrd proposed the amendment again on April 29, 2006.
Though the proposed amendment failed to be adopted, it led to the passing of the Equal Access Act.
Rick Perry, governor of Texas and Republican a former candidate for the 2012 presidential election, said in an interview on "Fox News Sunday" on December 11, 2011: "I would support a constitutional amendment that allows our children to pray in school anytime they would like."
Reception.
The Freedom From Religion Foundation, American Civil Liberties Union, and Americans United for Separation of Church and State have all expressed opposition to this amendment. The Family Research Council has supported it.

Connelly Range

The Connelly Range is a subrange of the Hogem Ranges of the Omineca Mountains, located between Bear Lake and the headwaters of the Omineca River in northern British Columbia, Canada. As the Omineca is in the Arctic Ocean drainage and Bear Lake that of the Pacific, the range is part of the Cnotinental Divide. It includes a group of volcanic plugs, the largest of which is The Thumb.
The range's named derived from that of Fort Connelly, a Hudson's Bay Company outpost founded by James Douglas, later Governor of Vancouver Island and British Columbia, during his tenure with the North West Company in New Caledonia, of which Fort Connelly was at the northwestern edge of. Sources vary as to where it was, either at the outlet of the Bear Lake (i.e. at its northern end) or on an island along the eastern shore near Tsaytut Bay. The name Fort Connelly today is associated with the settlement of Bear Lake.

Geography of Long Island

Long Island is in southeastern New York, United States, separated from the rest of the state by the East River and from Connecticut by Long Island Sound. Long Island contains four counties, of which the western two are boroughs (Queens and Brooklyn) of New York City, and the other two (Nassau and Suffolk) are mainly suburban.
Geology.
Long Island, as part of the Outer Lands region, is formed largely of two spines of glacial moraine, with a large, sandy outwash plain southeastwards, towards its barrier islands and the Atlantic Ocean, These moraines consist of gravel and loose rock left behind during the two most recent pulses of Wisconsin glaciation some 21,000 years ago (19,000 BC). The northern moraine, which directly abuts the North Shore of Long Island at points, is known as the Harbor Hill moraine. The more southerly moraine, known as the Ronkonkoma moraine, forms the "backbone" of Long Island; it runs primarily through the very center of Long Island, roughly coinciding with the length of the Long Island Expressway.
The land to the south of this moraine to the South Shore is the outwash plain of the last glacier. Part of this, known as the Hempstead Plains, supported one of the few natural prairies to exist east of the Appalachian Mountains.
The glaciers melted and receded to the north, resulting in the difference between the North Shore beaches and the South Shore beaches. The North Shore beaches are rocky from the remaining glacial debris, while the South Shore's are crisp, clear, outwash sand. Running along the center of the island like a spine is the moraine left by the glaciers. (Bald Hill, Farmingville, is the highest point along the moraine.) The glaciers also formed Lake Ronkonkoma, a kettle lake.
The island's tallest natural point is Jayne's Hill near Melville, with an elevation of 400.9 feet (122.2 m) above sea level. Long Island is separated from the mainland by the East River, not in fact a river, but a tidal strait. Long Island Sound forms the northern boundary of the island.
Long Island contains a series of sand and gravel aquifers, geologic formations which can hold, transmit, and yield water in usable quantities. All of Long Island's water supply comes from underground water reserves held in aquifers. Stacked one on top of the other like layers in a cake, three major and one minor aquifer make up the Long Island aquifer system. In sequence from shallowest to the deepest, the Long Island aquifers are: the Upper Glacial, the Magothy and the Lloyd Aquifers. All Long Island aquifers receive their fresh water from precipitation which takes from 25 to 1,000 years to migrate through the layers to the aquifers, which hold roughly 70 trillion US gallons (260 km3)—enough to flood the entire surface of Long Island with more than 300 feet (90 m) of water—and can withstand long droughts that could dry up surface-water reservoirs like the ones that supply New York City. Almost four million gallons each day are taken from beneath Nassau and Suffolk Counties, providing the primary source of water for the resident population. While most homes are on a municipal water system, there are still many areas where homes have their own wells to provide water. Both Nassau and Suffolk counties have long recognized their dependence on the aquifers and have stipulated that recharge basins (known locally as sumps) be built to collect ground water. Recharge basins are required and sized based upon the scale of any new development on Long Island. Due to contamination associated with development, concern to preserve the quality of Long Island's groundwater has become the single most important factor limiting the region's growth.
In a 1985 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court treated the island as a peninsula for the purposes of a boundary decision.
Climate.
Long Island has a climate similar to other coastal areas of the Northeastern United States; it has warm, humid summers and cold winters. The Atlantic Ocean helps bring afternoon sea breezes that temper the heat in the warmer months and limit the frequency and severity of thunderstorms. Severe thunderstorms are not uncommon, nevertheless, especially when they approach the island from the mainland areas of the Bronx, Westchester County and Connecticut in the northwest.
Temperatures.
Long Island temperatures vary from west to east, with the western part (Nassau County) of the island warmer on most occasions than the east (Suffolk County). This is due to two factors: the western part is closer to the mainland, and it is more densely developed, causing the "urban heat island" effect. The eastern part is cooler on most occasions due to moderation of the Atlantic Ocean and Long Island Sound, and its being less developed.
On dry nights with no clouds or wind, the Pine Barrens in eastern Suffolk County can be almost 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees Celsius) cooler due to Radiational cooling.
Winter weather.
Long Island sees the majority of its snowfall between the months of December and March, though it is not uncommon to see light snowfalls during mid-late November and early April. In many winters one or more intense storms (called a Nor'easter) produce blizzard conditions with snowfalls of 1–2 feet (30–60 cm) and near-hurricane force winds.
Average yearly snowfall totals range from approximately 20 to 35 inches (50–89 cm), with the north shore and western parts averaging more than the south shore and the east end. In any given winter, however, some parts of the island could see up to 75 inches (190 cm) or more. There are also some very quiet winters, in which most parts of the island could see less than 10 inches (25 cm).
Severe weather.
Long Island is somewhat vulnerable to hurricanes. Its northern location and relatively cool waters tend to weaken storms to below hurricane strength by the time they reach Long Island, although despite this, some storms have made landfall at Category 1 or greater strength, including two unnamed Category 3 storms in 1938 (New England Hurricane of 1938) and 1944, Hurricane Donna in 1960, Hurricane Belle in 1976, Hurricane Gloria in 1985, Hurricane Bob in 1991 (brushed the eastern tip) and Hurricane Floyd in 1999. (There is debate among climatologists as to whether Hurricane Floyd made landfall as a Category 1 or as a very strong "almost hurricane strength" tropical storm. The official records note it as the latter.)
Many other storms crossed the island directly at tropical storm strength, including Hurricane Bertha in 1996 and Hurricane Charley in 2004. In September 2006, the remnants of Hurricane Ernesto swept through the area, causing several temporary power outages on parts of the island. In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy crossed the island making landfall over New Jersey as a post-tropical cyclone with hurricane-force winds. On Long Island, damage from the storm included severe flooding along the south shore and downed trees and utility poles on the north shore.
Some thunderstorms can be extremely severe and tornadoes, although very rare, are possible. In September 1998, a small tornado hit Lynbrook; in August 1999, an F-2 tornado hit parts of Mattituck, in August 2005, a small tornado hit Glen Cove; one year later in August 2006, a small tornado hit Massapequa in Nassau County, and parts of Amityville, located in Suffolk County. On July 18, 2007, an F-1 tornado hit Islip Terrace and on September 27, 2006, a rare waterspout was seen over Long Island Sound near Port Jefferson. In the wintertime, temperatures are warmer than areas further inland (especially in the night and early morning hours), sometimes causing a snowstorm further inland to fall as rain or mixed precipitation on the island. In Late July 2008 off the coast of Quogue on Dune Road, a water spout formed in the ocean; the related severe thunderstorms were the worst reported in years.

Mandali Puja

Mandali Puja is a celebration in Chimkhola and nearby villages in the Dhawalagiri Zone of west-central Nepal. It is celebrated annually on a Tuesday in the month of Mangsir (the eighth month of the Nepalese calendar), after the Marghashirsha (the first month of winter) Sukla Pratipada with a black she-goat (if possible). It may also be observed individually throughout the year on Ujjali (Tuesday) of any month. Mandali Puja is observed to appeal for a cure from illness, relief of misfortune and success in foreign travel. Women who wish to become doctors believe that if they make an offering, 75% of them will be successful. The offering was originally a goat, but since 2025 BS (1968 AD) a pair of pigeons are also used. A comb, thread, ribbon, mirror and a sari are offered to the goddess. She is believed to be very powerful, so she is worshipped by people from different places.
Mandali Bajai.
According to legend, Mandali Bajai (third granddaughter of the last Thakuri king of Dholarthan) was married in Waakhet in Pathlekhet VDC. Her third daughter was Mandali Bajai. Since childhood she was different and at age 17 or 18, she was beaten and scolded by the villagers. Despite pain and illness she came to Chimkhola, crossing the Raghuganga River in 1921 BS (1864 AD). Mallika Puja was taking place at Mulkarha, and Mandali Bajai became a pilgrim. After a long night of celebration, on her way back to Chimkhola she was struck by a cow named Guleni on the north side of Mandali Than (now known as Chulthepathi) and died of her injuries. Eight to ten years after the accident Mandali Bajai began to appear through spiritualists, convincing them to worship her at the present place. Her veneration began in 1930 BS (1873 AD).
The shrine was originally near a large puwale bush, but in 1975 BS (1918 AD) Chambir Tilija, a devotee, built a fence around the area. In 2008 BS (1951 AD), however, a landslide from the Tamkhane Gahra destroyed the puwale bush and surrounding area. After the landslide the temple was moved to the north of the village, in Chamalabot. However, the witch doctors encouraged worship at the old site, near a milky tree. In accordance with their wishes, the villagers searched the area and found a dudelo tree (a tree in the region of Chimkhola which is used to feed domestic animals). Beginning in 2013 BS (1956 AD) worship began at the original site, which was again fenced in by Chambir Tilija. In 2021 BS (1964), G. K. Paha Bahadur Pun dedicated a temple; later, Karna Bahadur Tilija's sons Li Tam Bahaur Tilija, Som Bahadur Tilija, Moti Bahadur Tilija and Man Bahadur Tilija (who lived in the area) built another temple. In 2062 BS (2005), the original temple was renovated by G. K. Paha Bahadur Pun, Jaisara Pun (his oldest wife), Kali Maya Pun (his youngest wife), Indra Bahadur Pun (his oldest son), Ruk Maya Pun (his oldest daughter-in-law), Dek Bahadur Pun (his youngest son) and Bina Pun (his youngest daughter).

Bo Fo Sho is the first EP released by American comedian, Bo Burnham. The six-track, digital-only, comedy EP was released on by Comedy Central Records, and charted well across the "Billboard" charts.
Production.
After performing on Comedy Central's "The World Stands Up" in January 2008, Burnham signed a four-record deal with their label, Comedy Central Records. In a June 2008 interview with "Wired", Burnham described himself as "still a kid in his bedroom, writing songs and playing them" and that if "Bo Fo Sho" were anything else, "it would lose the whole DIY effect of how I started out."
During a 2008 show in Boston, Burnham joked that the song "Sunday School"—wherein he adopts the persona of an "overly exuberant" Sunday school teacher—was the reason he waited until after graduating from the all-boys Catholic high school, St. John's Preparatory, before releasing his EP.
Reception.

Rita Bennett

Rita Bennett ("née" Brandon; later Morgan) is a fictional character created by Jeff Lindsay for his book series about a vigilante serial killer named Dexter Morgan. She also appeared in the television series "Dexter", based on Lindsay's books. She was the girlfriend and later wife of Dexter in both media. Portrayed by Julie Benz, Rita was a series regular in the first four seasons until she was killed in the season four finale, "The Getaway". The character made her last television appearance in 2010; she was a special guest star in "Dexter" season five opener entitled "My Bad". The character remains alive in the "Dexter" novels and has appeared in every book in the series.
In the novels, Dexter initially considers Rita little more than part of his disguise as a normal human being, and the perfect cover for his secret life as a serial killer. He later admits to growing quite fond of Rita, whom he married in the third book, "Dexter in the Dark". In the television series, Rita is portrayed as a loving and caring mother who is emotionally damaged due to physical abuse by her former husband, Paul Bennett. Rita is the mother of Astor Bennett (Christina Robinson) and Cody Bennett (Preston Bailey), and later in the television series, gives birth to Dexter's son, Harrison. In the book series, she and Dexter have a daughter, Lily Anne.
Benz received positive reviews for her portrayal of Rita, winning a Satellite Award and Saturn Award, and receiving a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination. "Dexter" executive producer Clyde Phillips claimed the staff did not know Rita would be killed until late in the fourth season, but that her death began to feel inevitable as the story evolved. Benz was notified the day before the script was distributed to the cast and was disappointed, but found the scene revealing her death to be "very poetic". The character's departure was considered controversial by some reviewers; "E!" writer Kristin Dos Santos said that it "might go down as one of the most shocking deaths "ever" on television."
Appearances.
Literature.
Rita Bennett was a character in the "Dexter" series of novels written by author Jeff Lindsay. As of 2011 there are five books in the Dexter series, all of which include Rita. Rita first appears in the original novel "Darkly Dreaming Dexter". In the book series, Dexter Morgan's "love" for Rita seems less sincere than it does in the television series; he primarily considers her a part of his "disguise". In the TV series, Dexter initially begins dating Rita to seem like a normal person, but later admits he has grown "fond" of her, to the extent that he talks with a psychiatrist about his relationship issues — albeit to a psychiatrist he plans to kill.
In "Darkly Dreaming Dexter", the two are already together, but it is explained that Dexter started dating her solely to improve his "disguise" as a normal person. Because she was brutalized by her now-jailed ex-husband, Rita fears intimacy and does not expect much of Dexter; this suits the asexual Dexter perfectly. By the novel's climax, Dexter admits that he is fond of her children, Astor and Cody, the closest he can get to feeling love. By a humorous misunderstanding, the couple become engaged in "Dearly Devoted Dexter" and married at the end of "Dexter in the Dark". In the TV series, it is explicitly stated that Debra introduced them (after responding to the domestic dispute call) in the hope they would start dating. The books do not explain how they met. In the books, Rita is a physical fitness buff; she and Dexter regularly go for runs, long bike rides, and weightlifting sessions together. In the fifth book, "Dexter is Delicious", she gives birth to Dexter's daughter Lily Anne. In "Dearly Devoted Dexter", Dexter discovers that Rita's children, Cody and Astor, are budding sociopaths and decides to provide them with the same "guidance" that his adoptive father Harry gave to him; namely, to teach them how to be careful, efficient killers of those who "deserve it". Rita is kept in the dark about the true nature of their relationship. She suspects that something is wrong with the children when she discovers them torturing a cat, but Dexter is able to reassure her that they didn't understand what they were doing. The television series is based on "Darkly Dreaming Dexter".
Television.
Rita Bennett appears in the premiere episode of "Dexter", entitled "Dexter" and is introduced as Dexter Morgan's girlfriend. It is revealed early on that Rita was physically and sexually abused by Paul Bennett (Mark Pellegrino), her ex-husband and the father of her children, Astor (Christina Robinson) and Cody (Preston Bailey). Dexter's sister Debra Morgan answered a domestic violence call and saved her life. Rita, who is ignorant of Dexter's secret life as a serial killer, appears regularly throughout the first season as his main source of support. She plays a much larger role in the episode "Return to Sender", in which Paul is released from prison and demands to be at Astor's birthday party. Rita asks that he not come to the party. In "Circle of Friends", Rita tells Paul he can see his children only through supervised visits for six months before she will consider letting him have unsupervised visitation rights. She hands him divorce papers that include that clause, and Paul signs them. In "Father Knows Best", however, Paul begins threatening Rita again when she prevents him from seeing the children. He forces his way into her house, where she defends herself by hitting him over the head with a baseball bat. In "Seeing Red", Paul presses charges against Rita for assault. When Paul visits Rita's house, he threatens Dexter when they are alone in the kitchen; Dexter reacts by hitting him with a frying pan. After Paul loses consciousness, Dexter drives him back to his hotel and plants drugs on him. Dexter alerts the police and Paul is sent back to prison.
In the second season premiere Rita takes Astor and Cody to see Paul in prison. He insists that that Dexter dragged him out of Rita's house before drugging him and tipping off the police — and that if she could find his missing shoe it would prove his innocence. Rita tells him that there is no shoe, despite having found it more than a month previously. She later admits that she found the shoe, but refuses to acknowledge that Dexter is involved. That night she receives a call from the prison and learns that Paul was killed in an inmate altercation. In "Waiting to Exhale", after Paul's funeral, Rita confronts Dexter about his involvement in Paul's death, and he is forced to admit to having a heroin addiction in order to cover up his real secret. Rita threatens to leave Dexter if he does not commit to a program to deal with his "addiction". He starts attending Narcotics Anonymous meetings, where a mysterious woman named Lila Tournay (Jaime Murray) volunteers to be his sponsor. In "See-Through" Rita's visiting mother, Gail (JoBeth Williams), suspects that Dexter is hiding something from the family. In "Dex, Lies, and Videotape", Rita breaks up with Dexter after he admits that he cheated on her with Lila.
In "That Night, a Forest Grew," Rita stands up to her mother and insists that she move out of the house. Rita tells Dexter that he is no longer welcome to visit her house or her children. He apologizes, admitting that his affair with Lila was a mistake, but she is still hesitant to forgive him. When Dexter breaks up with Lila, she retaliates by pursuing his co-worker and friend, Angel Batista. In "There's Something About Harry," Rita and Dexter reconcile and visit the beach together. In the second season finale, Dexter is forced to lie about running away with Lila, in front of Debra. Lila, feeling hurt, leaves with what she recognizes as Dexter's bag of murder equipment. She goes to Rita's house and drugs the babysitter in order to abduct the children. When Dexter realizes that Astor and Cody are missing, he goes to Lila's apartment. She starts a fire and locks the three of them inside. Rita calls Debra for help and Debra decides to skip her flight to Oregon, with her boyfriend Frank Lundy. Dexter manages to pass Astor and Cody through a small window to the outside, and escapes after breaking down a thin wall.
In the season three opener "Our Father," Rita realizes that she is pregnant with Dexter's child. In "All In The Family", after an unsuccessful marriage proposal, Dexter tries to convince Rita that he is looking for more than a convenient merger of finances and parenthood. In "Turning Biminese," Rita is hospitalized after a medical emergency and Dexter cannot be found. Dexter is hesitant when Rita suggests that they buy a house and move in together. Rita becomes angry at Dexter's refusal to help organize their wedding. In the third season finale, "Do You Take Dexter Morgan?", Rita and Dexter get married.
In the fourth season opener, Rita and Dexter are living happily together in a suburban neighborhood with Astor, Cody, and new baby Harrison. In "Remains to be Seen" Dexter is in a terrible car accident, and Rita demands that he give her his keys so that she can drive him. In "If I Had a Hammer," friction begins to develop in the couple's relationship, and Dexter seeks guidance from Arthur Mitchell, a family man who appears to balance his responsibilities with his secret life as the "Trinity Killer". In "Hungry Man," Rita works hard to prepare Thanksgiving dinner. She shares a kiss with the next door neighbor, Elliot, when she asks if she can use his stove. Dexter arrives for an appointment with Rita for marriage counseling, but gets called to a crime scene as soon as he arrives. Soon after, Rita confesses that she and Elliot kissed, although Dexter tries to brush it off. Rita later admits that she felt hurt that he did not seem to care about her indiscretion. Dexter then punches Elliot and warns him to stay away from Rita, which reassures her that Dexter loves her. In the fourth season finale, Dexter asks her to go out of town so they can have a belated honeymoon; in reality, Dexter wants to keep her safe from Mitchell, who has learned his real identity and threatened to kill him and his family. After killing Mitchell, Dexter returns home and finds a message from Rita that she returned to pick up her identification for the flight. Dexter finds her dead in the bathtub — Mitchell's last victim. In the fifth season premiere "My Bad", Dexter realizes, much to his own surprise, that he genuinely loved Rita and is devastated by her death. Julie Benz reprised her role as Rita as a special guest star in a flashback to her and Dexter's first date, and as a corpse.
Development.
Casting and characterization.
The character of Bennett was originally invented by Jeff Lindsay for his series of novels about sociopath Dexter Morgan and she is featured in every book in the series. Clyde Phillips and Melissa Rosenberg wanted to bring the character into the television series when casting for the TV version, "Dexter". Julie Benz was given a copy of the script in 2005 and was asked to audition for the part. She was surprised because the script was "one of the best pilot scripts ever read." She also read for the part of Debra and joked that she would have auditioned for Dexter's role. Benz had been a fan of Michael C. Hall from his role in "Six Feet Under". She said in an interview with "Vanity Fair," "I was such a fan, to the point where my cell-phone ring was the show’s theme song. I had to change it once I got cast!". Benz performed for four seasons, until her character was killed in the series.
Rita is presented in the series as a loving and caring mother. As a result of her abuse from her husband, Rita has no interest in sex, which Dexter is secretly comfortable about. She developed a strong character. At the beginning of season two, the producers approached Benz about character growth. They wanted to make Rita stronger and less shattered than she was in the first season. Benz has said that she was "Very sad to hear that. Because I loved playing her in season one where she was this very damaged, fragile bird who was just struggling so hard to make a better world for her kids, but just could not do it."
Death.
Rita's death was alluded to by "Dexter" producers, who told media outlets "The Getaway" included a series-changing twist, leading to widespread speculation about it. Security precautions were taken to prevent the finale's secrets from becoming exposed. Network staff members were forced to sign non-disclosure agreements, and decoy scripts were drafted and disseminated to protect the twist ending. In one of the alternatives, Dexter learned about a child murderer escaping from prison, and tried to decide whether to join Rita on vacation or go after the escaped killer. Nobody but essential cast and staff were allowed on the set during filming of the episode, and the scripts and DVDs of the episode were watermarked before they were taken off the set.
Clyde Phillips claimed the "Dexter" staff did not know how the finale would conclude until late in the season, but he said Rita's death began to feel inevitable as the story evolved. Benz said she had been told that Lithgow knew about it from the beginning of the season. Phillips said the staff felt obligated to do more than kill the Trinity Killer in the final episode, especially because he felt the death of the third season antagonist (played by Jimmy Smits) was not handled "as well as we could have". The writers discussed the idea of having Debra find out about Dexter's secret life (an idea that was later realized as the season 6 finale), but decided they could not anticipate how drastically the series would be changed by that. Benz heard rumors from David Zayas that her character would be killed in the episode, but she was not notified until much later. The producers met with her the day before the season finale script was distributed to the cast. She said, "It was a tough meeting. In a bizarre way, it felt like a scene from "Defending Your Life"." Benz described the death scene as "very poetic". Clyde Philips said, "She wasn’t happy. She loved being with us. We loved having her with us. She took it... professionally. She was greatly disappointed. She’s a professional. She works in television. She knew that this was a possibility."
The mystery writer J.A. Jance wrote in the "Los Angeles Times", "Yes, it's a bit of a shock to discover that some of the TV series' characters who died last season or the season before are back among the living between the covers of Lindsay's new book. Rita, Dexter's long-suffering wife who died a terrible death in a bathtub in last year's season finale, is alive and well and having a baby in "Dexter Is Delicious". But my advice to readers is this: Don't quibble. Get over it. After all, fiction is an alternate universe to begin with, and Lindsay's dark, comedic fiction is an alternate universe once removed."
Reception.
Critical reaction.
The character of Rita has been well received by critics, who praised Benz’s portrayal. Eric Goldman of IGN has said, “Dexter does a solid job of developing the roles of the supporting cast, with Rita, Deb, Doakes and LaGuerta all getting a good amount of development”. He added, “There were a couple of forced moments in "Popping Cherry", most notably the drug dealer who came to Rita's house, in broad daylight, demanding money for her ex-husband's debts; it was all a bit over the top and cliché. On the other hand, it was interesting to note Dexter's inaction in that scene, making one wonder if perhaps he fears that any public display of physical defense, even for Rita, might result in him going too far and revealing what he is." Jarett Wieselman of the "New York Post" has said, "Rita always felt like the light in that dark show", and "In the beginning Rita was the vessel through which the audience could love Dexter." UGO.com placed Rita Bennett 7th on a list of "Top 11 Girlfriends on TV". Zap2it created a poll entitled "Best Mom" as part of their "Greatest TV Characters" series of polls; Rita was voted 12th on a list of 14 characters.
The TV.com staff were less appreciative, listing her as 7th out of the "Ten Most Annoying Characters on TV". They noted that "While we mostly love the beatific Julie Benz, her complaining wifey character has been reduced to little more than whimpering and murmuring about Dexter's commitment to the family..." and summarised with "Might Rita die next week? For the first time since the series began, we really feel like we wouldn't miss her."
Rita was killed in the fourth season finale "The Getaway." This was a subject of controversy. "E!" writer Kristin Dos Santos called the ending "horrifying" and said, "This death just might go down as one of the most shocking deaths "ever" on television." Claire Zulkey said that the twist ending was intense, and the teleplay was woven with feature several moments that had led him to expect different conclusions. He praised what he expected to be a "re-set" of the series after Rita's death. Marcia White of "The Express-Times" declared "Dexter" "one of the best cable dramas on TV" and called the final scene between Dexter and Rita completely shocking. Mark Dawidziak of "The Plain Dealer" said the episode was shocking and suspenseful, calling "Dexter" "a series that leaves you guessing as the psychological ambiguities run deeper and darker".
Accolades.
Julie Benz has been well received for her portrayal of Rita Bennett, winning and being nominated for a multitude of awards. These including one Satellite Award win for Best Supporting Actress and a Saturn Award win for Best Supporting Actress. She was also nominated for a Scream Award for Best Horror Actress and was jointly nominated, in 2009 and 2010, for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Ensemble in a Drama Series.

Christgarten Charterhouse

Christgarten Charterhouse ("Kloster Christgarten") is a former Carthusian monastery. or charterhouse, near Ederheim in Bavaria, Germany.
History.
The monastery, dedicated to Saint Peter, was founded in 1383 by counts Ludwig and Friedrich von Oettingen. The counts of Oettingen from 1525 supported the Reformation, and from 1558 Carthusian monks from Christgarten were called to be Protestant ministers. In the course of the Reformation the prior of Hürnheim (near Ederheim) also converted to the new teaching and from then on ministered to Christgarten in a Reformist spirit.
Nevertheless, the charterhouse was not dissolved until after the Thirty Years' War, in 1649. In 1656 the bell tower was demolished; further buildings followed in the 18th and 19th centuries. All that remained of the monastic church was the choir, which was used as the Protestant parish church. The "Scheuffelin altar" was given to the Alte Pinakothek in Munich.

Elephant trunk snake

Acrochordus javanicus, commonly known as the Elephant Trunk Snake, belongs to the Acrochordidae family which represents a group of primitive non-venemous aquatic snakes.
Description.
Acrochordus javanicus possesses a wide and flat head, nostrils situated on the top of the snout. Those head's particularities confer to Acrochordus javanicus a certain resemblance with boas. However, its head is also wide as the body.Females are bigger than males and the maximal size of an individual is 240 cms. The dorsal side of the snake's body is brown and its ventral side is pale yellow.
The skin is baggy and loose giving the impression that it is too big for the animal. The skin is covered with small rough adjacent scales. The skin is also used in the tannery industry and its leather is called Karung.
Those aquatics snakes are ovoviviparous, the incubation lasts 5 in 6 months and the female expels from 6 to 17 young.
Distribution.
Acrochordus javanicus is usually met in the central tropical Indo-Pacific waters.
In Indonesia like in Kalimantan, Sumatra, Java and may occur in Bali; in the west coast of Malaysia and also in Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam but not east of the Wallace Line.
Habitat.
Acrochordus javanicus has a costal living habitat like rivers, estuaries and lagoons.
But it prefers freshwater and brackish environments.
Feeding.
Acrochordus javanicus is an ambush predator that likes to capture fishes and amphibians. It usually catch its preys by folding firmly its body around it. Its loose, baggy skin and its sharp scales find their utility by limiting any risk of escape of the prey, in particular fishes which body is covered with a viscous protective mucus.
Behavior.
Acrochordus javanicus is active at night. It spends most of its life under water and rarely goes on land. It can stay under water up to 40 minutes.

Taiheiyo evergreen forests

The Taiheiyo evergreen forests is a temperate broadleaf forest ecoregion of Japan.
The ecoregion covers an area of on the Pacific "(Taiheiyo)" side of the islands of Honshū, Shikoku, and Kyūshū. The influence of the Japan Current creates a humid climate with mild winters and a long growing season, which nurtured evergreen broadleaf forests. Laurel forests grew near the coast, and Oak forests were predominant inland. At higher elevations, the Taiheiyo evergreen forests yielded to the Taiheiyo montane deciduous forests of the interior.
The forests include a mix of species with origins in temperate and tropical Asia. Species with tropical origins include two species of the conifer "Podocarpus,", two species of "Pittosporum", several species in the Laurel family "(Machilus, Neolitsea," and "Cinnamomum)", and the Cycad "Cycas revoluta". Trees with origins in temperate Eurasia include species of evergreen Oaks and "Castanopsis".
The ecoregion is home to Japan's largest cities, including Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, and Nagoya, and most of forests have been converted to agriculture or cities. Remnant areas of forest remain around temples and shrines, on steep slopes, and in gorges. Secondary growth woodlands, called "Satoyama", are found on hillsides bordering farmlands.

Edonia () was an ancient region in present-day Greece, located to the east of Chalkidice, between the Nestus and Strymon rivers, in what is now East Macedonia and Thrace. It was home to the Edonian people, a local Balkan tribe considered "barbarian" by the Greeks. Notable Edonian cities include Drabescus and Myrcinus. Later, the Greeks settled in the region, drove out the Edonians and built several colonies, including Amphipolis, and Eion.
According to the Greek mythology, the Edonians were ruled at one time by Lycurgus who was destroyed by Bacchus for opposing his worship. The Edonides, the women of the Edoni and worshippers of Bacchus, murdered Orpheus, and were turned into oak trees.

Salvia

Salvia is the largest genus of plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae, with nearly 1000 species of shrubs, herbaceous perennials, and annuals. Within the Lamiaceae, "Salvia" is member of the tribe Mentheae within the subfamily Nepetoideae. It is one of several genera commonly referred to as sage.
The genus is distributed throughout the Old World and the Americas, with three distinct regions of diversity: Central and South America (approx. 500 species); Central Asia and Mediterranean (250 species); Eastern Asia (90 species).
Names.
The name "Salvia" "salviya" derives from the Latin "salvere" ("to feel well and healthy, health, heal"), the verb related to "salus" (health, well-being, prosperity or salvation); referring to the herb's healing properties. Pliny the Elder was the first author known to describe a plant called ""Salvia"" by the Romans, likely describing the type species for the genus "Salvia", "Salvia officinalis". 
The common modern English name "sage" derives from Middle English "sawge", which was borrowed from Old French "sauge", and like the botanical name, stems from Latin "salvere". When used without modifiers, the name 'sage' generally refers to "Salvia officinalis" ("common sage" or "culinary sage"); however, it is used with modifiers to refer to any member of the genus. The ornamental species are commonly referred to by their genus name "Salvia".
Description.
"Salvia" species include annual, biennial, or perennial herbs, along with woody subshrubs. The stems are typically angled like other members in Lamiaceae. The leaves are typically entire, but sometimes toothed or pinnately divided. The flowering stems bear small bracts, dissimilar to the basal leaves—in some species the bracts are ornamental and showy. 
The flowers are produced in racemes, or panicles, and generally produce a showy display with flower colors ranging from blue to red, with white and yellow less common. The calyx is normally tubular or bell shaped, without bearded throats, and divided into two parts or lips, the upper lip entire or three-toothed, the lower two-cleft. The corollas are often claw shaped and are two-lipped. The upper lip is usually entire or three-toothed. The lower lip typically has two lobes. The stamens are reduced to two short structures with anthers two-celled, the upper cell fertile, and the lower imperfect. The flower styles are two-cleft. The fruits are smooth ovoid or oblong nutlets and in many species they have a mucilaginous coating.
Many "salvias" have trichomes (hairs) growing on the leaves, stems, and flowers, which help to reduce water loss in some species. Sometimes the hairs are glandular and secrete volatile oils that typically give a distinct aroma to the plant. When the hairs are rubbed or brushed, some of the oil-bearing cells are ruptured, releasing the oil. This often results in the plant being unattractive to grazing animals and some insects.
Staminal lever mechanism.
The defining characteristic of the genus "Salvia" is the unusual pollination mechanism. It is central to any investigation into the systematics, species radiation, or pollination biology of "Salvia". It consists of two stamens (instead of the typical four found in other members of the tribe Mentheae) and the two thecae on each stamen are separated by an elongate connective. It is the elongation of the connective that enables the formation of the lever mechanism. Sprengel (1793) was the first to illustrate and describe the nototribic (dorsal) pollination mechanism in Salvia. When a pollinator probes a male stage flower for nectar, (pushing the posterior anther theca) the lever causes the stamens to move and the pollen to be deposited on the pollinator. When the pollinator withdraws from the flower, the lever returns the stamens to their original position. In older, female stage flowers, the stigma is bent down in a general location that corresponds to where the pollen was deposited on the pollinator's body. The lever of most "Salvia" species is not specialized for a single pollinator, but is generic and selected to be easily released by many bird and bee pollinators of varying shapes and sizes. The lever arm can be specialized to be different lengths so that the pollen is deposited on different parts of the pollinator’s body. For example, if a bee went to one flower and pollen was deposited on the far back of her body, but then it flew to another flower where the stigma was more forward (anterior), pollination could not take place. This can result in reproductive isolation from the parental population and new speciation can occur. It is believed that the lever mechanism is a key factor in the speciation, adaptive radiation, and diversity of this large genus.
Classification of species.
George Bentham was first to give a full monographic account of the genus in 1832-1836, and based his classifications on staminal morphology. Bentham's work on classifying the family Labiatae ("Labiatarum Genera et Species" (1836)) is still the only comprehensive and global organization of the family. While he was clear about the integrity of the overall family, he was less confident about his organization of "Salvia", the largest genus in Labiatae (also called Lamiaceae). Based on his own philosophy of classification, he wrote that he "ought to have formed five or six genera" out of "Salvia". In the end, he felt that the advantage in placing a relatively uniform grouping in one genus was "more than counterbalanced by the necessity of changing more than two hundred names." At that time there were only 291 known "Salvia" species.
Bentham eventually organized "Salvia" into twelve sections (originally fourteen), based on differences in corolla, calyx, and stamens. These were placed into four subgenera that were generally divided into Old World and New World species:
His system is still the most widely studied classification of "Salvia", even though more than 500 new species have been discovered since his work. Other botanists have since offered modified versions of Bentham's classification system, while botanists in the last hundred years generally do not endorse Bentham's system.
It was long assumed that "Salvia"'s unusual pollination and stamen structure had evolved only once, and that therefore "Salvia" was monophyletic, meaning that all members of the genus evolved from one ancestor. However, the immense diversity in staminal structure, vegetative habit, and floral morphology of the species within "Salvia" has opened the debate about its infrageneric classifications. Through DNA sequencing, "Salvia" was shown to not be monophyletic but to consist of three separate clades ("Salvia" clades I-III) each with different sister groups. They also found that the staminal lever mechanism evolved at least two separate times, through convergent evolution. Walker and Sytsma (2007) clarified this parallel evolution in a later paper combining molecular and morphological data to prove three independent lineages of the "Salvia" lever mechanism, each corresponding to a clade within the genus. It is surprising to see how similar the staminal lever mechanism structures are between the three lineages, so "Salvia" proves to be an interesting but excellent example of convergent evolution. 
Walker and Sytsma (2007) also addressed the question of whether "Salvia" is truly polyphyletic or just paraphyletic within the tribe Mentheae. To make "Salvia" monophyletic would require the inclusion of 13 species from "Rosmarinus", "Perovskia", "Dorystaechas", "Meriandra", and "Zhumeria" genera. The information attained by Walker and Sytsma (2007) supporting the three independent origins of the staminal lever indicate that "Salvia" is not the case where 13 species (currently not members of the genus) are actually members of "Salvia" but underwent character reversals—in other words, "Salvia" is paraphyletic. Instead, "Salvia" is defined by its convergent character of distinct staminal evolution that proves its polyphyly.
The description of individual species within "Salvia" has undergone constant revision. Many species are similar to each other, and many species have varieties that have been given different specific names. There have been as many as 2,000 named species and subspecies. Over time, the number has been reduced to less than a thousand. A modern and comprehensive study of "Salvia" species was done by Gabriel Alziar, in his "Catalogue Synonymique des "Salvia" du Monde" (1989) (World Catalog of "Salvia" Synonyms). He found that the number of distinct species and subspecies could be reduced to less than 700.
Selected species and their uses.
Many species are used as herbs, as ornamental plants (usually for flower interest), and sometimes for their ornamental and aromatic foliage. A selection of some well known species is below. 
"Salvia" species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species including the bucculatricid leaf-miner "Bucculatrix taeniola" which feeds exclusively on the genus and the "Coleophora" case-bearers "C. aegyptiacae", "C. salviella" (both feed exclusively on "S. aegyptiaca"), "C. ornatipennella" and "C. virgatella" (both recorded on "S. pratensis").

Transcend Music

Transcend Music, formerly Transcend Records, is a British metal record label and management company. Founded in 2007 by Rob Ferguson, they have signed acts such as Malefice, Crash Mansion, and Stormbringer.
History.
Transcend Music was founded as Transcend Records in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom in 2007. From the beginning the label's main focus was rock and metal, though a wider variety in genre of earlier releases included acid folk and art rock Founder Rob Ferguson has stated, "starting the label was something I was driven to do out of frustration. I was already working with bands in a management capacity and I felt that I could offer a better solution for those artists to get their music out and advance their careers."
Ferguson had previously worked with artists as diverse as George Harrison, Pete Townshend, John Entwhistle, Duran Duran, Iron Maiden, The Spice Girls, and Robbie Williams. He was also personal manager to both Matt Goss and Luke Goss from teen band Bros.
The label's first full length release was "The Unholy Feast" by The More I See, produced by Andy Sneap.
By 2008 the label had expanded to also handle management and merchandise. They also changed their name to Transcend Music Ltd., which is often shortened to Transcend Music. In 2009 they signed an exclusive distribution deal with Plastic Head Music in Europe, the biggest independent distributor in the UK. In March 2010 they announced they had absorbed the management and booking operation Legacy Agency, which had been formed in late 2008 by Carl Sewell. Legacy had by then worked with bands such as Carcer City. Transcend Music announced "a major restructuring program" in June 2012, which involved new signings and streamlining measures, as well as absorbing RMR Management.
Ferguson is featured in a number of real crime books, including two by UK gangster Reggie Kray and more recently in books by modern celebrity gangster Dave Courtney. Ferguson took a number of celebrities to meet Reggie Kray in prison, including the Fun Lovin Criminals. In April 2000 Ferguson was pictured in the funeral cortege of Charlie Kray, in the car with 'Mad' Frankie Fraser and Bartley Gorman King of the Gypsies. Ferguson has also been reported in private meetings with Lord Jeffrey Archer.
Artists.
The label has both a roster of bands it releases music for, and it also manages bands such as Fields of the Nephilim, Sacred Mother Tongue, The Dirty Youth, Viking Skull, Crash Mansion, and Stormbringer. Rob Ferguson has stated that he signed Sacred Mother Tongue after first spotting them playing metal covers and a few original songs in a pub.

Babybel

Babybel is a brand of cheese sold internationally. The Bel Group introduced Babybel in 1952 and in 1977 Mini Babybel was launched in Stoke-on-Trent. In 1979, Mini Babybel was launched in the U.S. under the Laughing Cow umbrella brand. As of 2011, Mini Babybel is sold in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Australia and Asia. As of March 2011, 75% of all Mini Babybel cheese is eaten outside of France.
The brand is marketed as a natural, convenient snack. Flavors distributed in the U.S. are created in Leitchfield, Kentucky, and at times in France.
Product.
Mini Babybel is known for its unique packaging which consists of a netted bag in which each piece of ellipsoid cheese is encased in wax, with an outer cellophane wrapper. Numerous flavors of Mini Babybel are offered across the world. The original Mini Babybel and US distributed Mini Babybel, an Edam variety, is encased in red wax. Other varieties offered in Europe are available such as Mini Babybel Light (diet version of the Edam variety) in red wax with a light blue label, Emmental in yellow wax, Gouda in yellow wax with an orange wrapper, Goat in green wax and Cheddar in purple wax. The original is also available in certified Kosher and Halal variety in the UK, which come in nets of 5 with each cheese wheel weighing 22 grams - slightly more than the original varieties. Tesco and Sainsbury's are the first major UK supermarkets to sell certified Kosher/Halal Mini Babybel ranges. All are suitable for lacto-vegetarians, as they do not use animal rennet.
There are currently eight flavors offered in the US: Original, Sharp Original, Light, Bonbel, Cheddar, White Cheddar, Mozzarella, and Gouda. Original is wrapped in red, Light in white with light blue packaging, Bonbel in yellow, Cheddar in orange, Gouda in brown, Sharp Original in purple, Mozzarella in green, and White Cheddar in white with cream packaging.
Advertising.
Outside the U.S., an advertising jingle associated with the product plays on the lyrics of the song "Barbara Ann", written by Fred Fassert and recorded by The Regents, and later a hit for The Beach Boys. They tout the product as an "always on the go and ready for anything" snack cheese due to its red wax wrapper.
As of 2012, a recording of the song "Get in Line" by I'm from Barcelona has been used in their European adverts, where the band re-recorded the song with a children's choir.
In 2012 there was controversy over its promotional use of the French slogan "Des vacances de malade mental" ("having a mental holiday", or literally "holidaying like a mentally ill person") which was deemed offensive to people with learning difficulties or mental illnesses.

Liposuction

Liposuction, also known as lipoplasty ("fat modeling"), liposculpture suction lipectomy ("suction-assisted fat removal") or simply lipo, is a cosmetic surgery operation that removes fat from many different sites on the human body. Areas affected can range from the abdomen, thighs and buttocks, to the neck, backs of the arms and elsewhere.
Several factors limit the amount of fat that can be safely removed in one session. Ultimately, the operating physician and the patient make the decision. There are negative aspects to removing too much fat. Unusual "lumpiness" and/or "dents" in the skin can be seen in those patients "over-suctioned". The more fat removed, the higher the surgical risk.
While reports of people removing 50 pounds (20 kg or around 4 stone) of fat have been claimed, the contouring possible with liposuction may cause the appearance of weight loss to be greater than the actual amount of fat removed. The procedure may be performed under general, regional, or local anesthesia. The safety of the technique relates not only to the amount of tissue removed, but to the choice of anesthetic and the patient's overall health. It is ideal for the patient to be as fit as possible before the procedure and not to have smoked for several months.
Relatively modern techniques for body contouring and removal of fat were first performed by a French surgeon, Charles Dujarier. A 1926 case that resulted in gangrene in the leg of a French model in a procedure performed by Dr. Dujarier set back interest in body contouring for decades to follow.
History.
Liposuction evolved from work in the late 1960s from surgeons in Europe using primitive curettage techniques which were largely ignored, as they achieved irregular results with significant morbidity and bleeding . The invention of modern liposuction procedure is linked to the name of two Italian gynecologists, Arpad and Giorgio Fischer, who created the blunt tunneling method in 1974. Then, liposuction first burst on the scene in a presentation by the French surgeon, Dr Yves-Gerard Illouz, in 1982. The "Illouz Method" featured a technique of suction-assisted lipolysis after tumesing or infusing fluid into tissues using blunt cannulas and high-vacuum suction and demonstrated both reproducible good results and low morbidity. Another French surgeon, Pierre Fournier used lidocaine as local anesthetic, modified the incision technique, and began to use compression after the operation. During the 1980s, many United States surgeons experimented with liposuction, developing some variation sedation rather than general anesthesia. Concerns over the high volume of fluid and potential toxicity of lidocaine with tumescent techniques eventually led to the concept of lower volume "super wet" tumescence.
In the late 1990s, ultrasound was introduced to facilitate the fat removal by first liquefying the fat using ultrasonic energy. After a flurry of initial interest, an increase in traditional techniques. There are practitioners who report that many of the modern technologies touted to improve liposuction are simply advertising hooks and that the choice of a quality surgeon is the primary determinant of a quality result.
Overall, the advantages of 30 years of improvements have been that more fat cells can more easily be removed, with less blood loss, less discomfort, and less risk. Recent developments suggest that the recovery period can be shortened as well. In addition, fat can also be used as a natural filler. This is sometimes referred to as "autologous fat transfer" and in general, for these procedures, fat is removed from one area of the patient's body (for example, the stomach), cleaned, and then re-injected into an area of the body where contouring is desired, for example, to reduce or eliminate wrinkles.
Popularity.
Removal of very large volumes of fat is a complex and potentially life-threatening procedure. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons defines "large" in this context as being more than 5 liters (around 10½ pints). Most often, liposuction is performed on the arms, abdomen, butt, and thighs in women, and the chest, abdomen, and flanks in men. According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery and ISAPS 2011 Statistics, liposuction was the most common plastic surgery procedure performed in 2006 with 403,684 patients and in the year 2011 with 1,268,287 patients.
Candidacy.
Not everyone is a good candidate for liposuction. It is not a good alternative to dieting or exercising. To be a good candidate, one must usually be over 18 and in good general health, have an ongoing diet and exercise regimen, and have fatty pockets of tissue available in certain body areas. Significant disease limiting risk (e.g. Diabetes, any infection, heart or circulation problems) weigh against the eligibility of a person for the procedure. In older people, the skin is usually less elastic, limiting the ability of the skin to readily tighten around the new shape. Liposuction of the abdominal fat should not be combined with simultaneous tummy tuck procedures due to higher risk of complications and mortality. Laws in Florida prevent practitioners combining liposuction of the upper abdomen and simultaneous abdominoplasty because of higher risks.
Approaches.
The basic surgical challenge of any liposuction procedure is:
As techniques have been refined, many ideas have emerged that have brought liposuction closer to being safe, easy, less uncomfortable, and effective. The marketing that goes on makes it hard for the consumer to determine truth from exaggeration however.
Techniques.
In general, fat is removed via a cannula (a hollow tube) and aspirator (a suction device). Liposuction techniques can be categorized by the amount of fluid injection and by the mechanism in which the cannula works.
Mechanism of liposuction.
Suction-assisted liposuction (SAL).
Suction-assisted liposuction is the standard method of liposuction. In this approach, a small cannula (like a straw) is inserted through a small incision. It is attached to a vacuum device. The surgeon pushes and pulls it in a forwards and backwards motion, carefully through the fat layer, breaking up the fat cells and drawing them out of the body by suction.
Ultrasound-assisted liposuction (UAL).
In ultrasound-assisted or ultrasonic liposuction, a specialized cannula is used which transmits ultrasound vibrations within the body. This vibration bursts the walls of the fat cells, emulsifying the fat (i.e., liquefying it) and making it easier to suction out. UAL is a good choice for working on more fibrous areas, like the upper back or male breast area. It takes longer than traditional liposuction, but not longer than tumescent liposuction. There is slightly less blood loss. There appears to be slightly more risk of seromas forming (pockets of fluid) which may have to be drained with a needle.
After ultrasonic liposuction, it is necessary to perform suction-assisted liposuction to remove the liquified fat, or to deposit additional fat cells, used in high definition liposuction, to create more volume where it is needed. Ultrasound-assisted liposuction techniques used in the 1980s and 1990s were associated with cases of tissue damage, usually from excessive exposure to ultrasound energy. Third-generation UAL devices address this problem by using pulsed energy delivery and a specialized probe that allows physicians to safely remove excess fat.
Power-assisted liposuction (PAL).
PAL uses a specialized cannula with mechanized movement, so that the surgeon does not need to make as many manual movements. Otherwise it is similar to traditional SAL.
Twin-cannula (assisted) liposuction (TCAL or TCL).
Twin cannula (assisted) liposuction uses a tube-within-a-tube specialized cannula pair, so that the cannula which aspirates fat, the mechanically reciprocated inner cannula, does not impact the patient's tissue or the surgeon's joints with each and every forward stroke. The aspirating inner cannula reciprocates within the slotted outer cannula to simulate a surgeon's stroke of up to 5 cm (2 in) rather than merely vibrating 1–2 mm (1/4 in) as other power assisted devices, removing most of the labor from the procedure. Superficial or subdermal liposuction is facilitated by the spacing effect of the outer cannula and the fact that the cannulas do not get hot, eliminating the potential for friction burns.
External ultrasound-assisted liposuction (XUAL or EUAL).
XUAL is a type of UAL where the ultrasonic energy is applied from outside the body, through the skin, making the specialized cannula of the UAL procedure unnecessary. It was developed because surgeons found that in some cases, the UAL method caused skin necrosis (death) and seromas, which are pockets of a pale yellowish fluid from the body, analogous to hematomas (pockets of red blood cells).
XUAL is a possible way to avoid such complications by having the ultrasound applied externally. It can also potentially cause less discomfort for the patient, both during the procedure and afterwards; decrease blood loss; allow better access through scar tissue; and treat larger areas. At this time however, it is not widely used and studies are not conclusive as to its effectiveness .
Water-assisted liposuction (WAL).
WAL uses a thin fan-shaped water beam, which loosens the structure of the fat tissue, so that it can be removed by a special cannula. During the liposuction the water is continually added and almost immediately aspirated via the same cannula. WAL requires less infiltration solution and produces less immediate edema from the tumescent fluid.
Laser Assisted.
A laser is used to melt the fat in the target area, making it easier to remove. This laser is administered through a fibre threaded through a microcannula. The premise is similar to UAL. It is believed that these techniques, such as SmartLipo or SlimLipo, can also reduce bruising and bleeding, as it also cauterizes to a certain extent.
Tumescent technique.
Tumescent liposuction is a technique that provides local anesthesia to large volumes of subcutaneous fat and thus permits liposuction totally by local anesthesia. In the past, liposuction surgery required blood transfusions because of significant blood loss in the liposuction aspirate. The tumescent liposuction technique eliminates both the need for general anesthesia and intravenous narcotics and sedatives while minimizing blood loss.
SAFELipo.
SAFELipo is a form of liposuction that includes steps for both fat shifting and fat grafting. The SAFELipo process employs the use of an exploded-tip probe or cannula to separate and liquefy fat prior to aspiration. Following aspiration, an exploded-tip probe or cannula is used to equalize local fat grafts. This step reduces the risk of complications including skin irregularities and dermal adhesions. SAFELipo is appropriate for both large- and small-volume liposuction procedures.
History.
SAFELipo was developed in the early 2000s by Dr. Simeon Wall, Jr., an American plastic surgeon based in Shreveport, Louisiana. The technique was originally indicated for revisionary liposuction procedures but was eventually determined to be useful on a variety of patients.
Since its inception, a number of plastic surgeons across the United States have adopted SAFELipo for use in their own practices, either on its own or as an alternative to other forms of liposuction.
Process.
SAFELipo employs a proprietary 3-step process:
Sutures.
Since the incisions are small, and the amount of fluid that must drain out is large, some surgeons opt to leave the incisions open, the better to clear the patient's body of excess fluid. They find that the unimpeded departure of that fluid allows the incisions to heal more quickly. Others suture them only partially, leaving space for the fluid to drain out. Others delay suturing until most of the fluid has drained out, about 1 or 2 days. In any case, while the fluid is draining, dressings need to be changed often. After one to three days, small self-adhesive bandages are sufficient. Doctors disagree on the issues of scarring with not suturing versus resolution of the swelling allowed by leaving the wounds open to drain fluid.
Preparation.
Before receiving any of the procedures, no anticoagulants should be taken for two weeks before the surgery. If general anesthesia or sedation will be used, and the surgery will be in the morning, fasting from midnight the night before is required. If only local anesthesia will be used, fasting is not required. Smoking of tobacco must be avoided for about two months prior to surgery, as nicotine interferes with circulation and can result in loss of tissue. Bruising can be seen in people who smoke post surgery.
Procedure.
In all liposuction methods, there are certain things that should be done when having the procedure:
Recovery.
Depending on the extent of the liposuction, patients are generally able to return to work between two days and two weeks. A compression garment which can easily be removed by the patient is worn for two to four weeks, this garment must have elasticity and allow for use of bandages. If non-absorbable sutures are placed, they will be removed after five to ten days.
Any pain is controlled by a prescription or over-the-counter medication, and may last as long as two weeks, depending on the particular procedure. Bruising will fade after a few days or maybe as long as two weeks later. Swelling will subside in anywhere from two weeks to two months, while numbness may last for several weeks. Normal activity can be resumed anywhere from several days to several weeks afterwards, depending on the procedure. The final result will be evident anywhere from one to six months after surgery, although the patient will see noticeable difference within days or weeks, as swelling subsides.
The suctioned fat cells are permanently gone. However, if the patient does not maintain a proper diet and exercise regimen, the remaining fat cell neighbors could still enlarge, creating irregularities.
Health benefits.
Whether or not liposuction provides the health benefits commonly associated with achieving weight loss through other means is a matter of debate in scientific circles. Mainstream doctors agree that liposuction does not help to combat obesity related metabolic disorders like insulin resistance.
Side effects.
A side effect, as opposed to a complication, is medically minor, although it can be uncomfortable, annoying, and even painful.
There could be various factors limiting movement for a short while, such as:
The surgeon should advise on how soon the patient can resume normal activity.
Possible complications.
As with any surgery, there are certain risks, beyond the temporary and minor side effects. The surgeon should mention them during a consultation. Careful patient selection minimizes their occurrence. Their likelihood is somewhat increased when treated areas are very large or numerous and a large amount of fat is removed.
During the 1990s there were some deaths as a result of liposuction, as well as alarmingly high rates of complication. By studying more and educating themselves further, surgeons have reduced complication rates. A study published in "Dermatologic Surgery" (July 2004, pp. 967–978), found that "The overall clinical complication rate liposuction ... was 0.7% (5 out of 702)", the minor complication rate was 0.57%, and the major complication rate was 0.14% with one patient requiring hospitalization.
The more serious possible complications include:
The cosmetic surgeon should give the participant a written list of symptoms to watch for, along with instructions for post-operative self-care.
Combined with other procedures.
Liposuction and tightening / lifting skin.
The removal of quantities of fat from under the skin allows the elastic skin to potentially retract after SAL. Good examples of this effect are seen after liposuction to the arms, stomach areas and breasts. The level of skin retraction following liposuction is affected by the age of the patient, quality of skin, presence of underlying disease or smoking and the presence of previous skin damage such as caused by childbirth and surgery. Liposuction techniques such as subdermal undermining using fine cannulas can stimulate further skin retraction but are more frequently associated with contour irregularity. While subdermal undermining may help the skin contract, patients with severe elasticity loss and heavy stretch marks prior to liposculpture may require removal of redundant skin by surgical means after liposculpture. Usually this can be performed after 6 months.
Surgical lifts such as a rhytidectomy (facelift), mastopexy (breast lift), abdominoplasty (tummy tuck), or lower body lift, thigh lift, or buttock lift can be utilized when sagging skin alone is the issue or after massive weight loss when the combination of large amounts of skin and shrunken fat cause significant skin droop.
Large volume Liposuction (SAL) in combination with other surgery is common, but may have higher complication rates. When done simultaneously, SAL is done minimally in the areas of the undermined tissues to minimize further insult to the blood supply, however a new technique in tummytuck surgery involves vigorous liposuction first before excising the redundant skin.
Non-surgical alternatives.
Cryolipolysis.
Cryolipolysis is the non-invasive cooling of adipose tissue to induce lipolysis - the breaking down of fat cells - to reduce body fat without damage to other tissues.
Diet and exercise.
Healthy eating habits combined with regular exercise also help people lose weight. This natural process, however, takes more time and determination than liposuction. Weight loss via exercise and healthy eating carries little risk compared to liposuction. Some authors argue that weight loss from liposuction is inconsistent at best and make light of those guaranteeing weight loss to liposuction clients.
