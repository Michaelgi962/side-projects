Church of Our Lady, Assens

The Church of Our Lady in Assens is the second largest church on the island of Funen, Denmark. It is a Church of Denmark parish church.
History.
The main chapel on the north side of the church and the lower, square part of the tower are remains of a Romanesque church. In 1488 the church stood in its present form. The Catholic past of the building is heralded in a monstrance, now located to the right of the altar, and a stoup in what was then the porch.
After the Reformation, it came into use as a protestant church. It underwent rough-handed restoration work in 1842-56 and 1881-84.
Architecture.
The church is a three-nave church built in large, red brick of the type in Denmark known as monk stone ("munkesten"). Typically of Gothic churches, the roofs of the aisles are lower than that of the central nave, allowing light to enter through clerestory windows. 
The tower stands at 48 metres. Its octagonal upper part is unusual in Danish church architecture, the only similar design is that of the five towers of Church of Our Lady in Kalundborg.
Furnishings.
The altarpiece dates from about 1620. The painting is from 1826 and by Dankvart Dreyer. It was a gift from the painter who was born in Assens and settled there again later in life. Another work by a local artist found in the church is a marble angel created by the sculptor Jens Adolf Jerichau who was born in Assens in 1816, incidentally the same year as Dreyer.
The pulpit, from the second half of the 17th century, was made in Hans Nielsen Bangs's workshop and is decorated with woodcarvings depicting scenes from the Passion on the sides, and nine wooden figures on the edges, probably representing nine of the disciples. Figures of the last three disciples may have decorated the stairs leading up to the pulpit. It also has an hour glass from the 18th century, probably to ensure that the priest's services did not last more than one hour.
The wrought iron balustrade of the altar rails feature a crossed hammer and key, the trademark of King Christian IV's court smith, Casper Finck.
The pews are from 2007. Individual chairs were introduced as seating in the early 1940s. They have an integrated sound system in the backrests and heated seats.
Burials.
More than 450 people were buried inside the church in the 18th century. Some were covered with richly decorated tomb stones while others were covered with brick or simple wooden planks. All the burials were removed from the church in the beginning of the 19th century when burials inside churches were abolished due to health risk. The tomb stones were then placed along the external walls of the church.

The Complete Studio Albums (1983 – 2008)

The Complete Studio Albums (1983 – 2008) is a box set by American singer-songwriter Madonna. It was released by her former label Warner Bros. Records on March 26, 2012, to coincide with the release of her twelfth studio album, "MDNA". The eleven-disc box set was released in Europe and Japan, and included all of Madonna's studio albums from the years 1983 to 2008. The album artwork consisted of a collage of the album covers, housed in a gold box, it also included a Parental Advisory sticker due to the inclusion of the albums "Erotica" (1992) and "American Life" (2003). On the same date, Warner Bros. released another box set titled "Madonna: Original Album Series" which included five discs.
Background.
On March 6, 2012, Madonna's official website announced that her former record company, Warner Bros. Records (1982–2009), was to release the eleven-disc box set. It was released to coincide and on the same date as the 2012 studio album "MDNA". The set includes every studio album Madonna has released; the remastered versions of "Madonna" (1983), "Like a Virgin" (1984) and "True Blue" (1986), plus the original versions of "Like a Prayer" (1989), "Erotica" (1992), "Bedtime Stories" (1994), "Ray of Light" (1998), "Music" (2000), "American Life" (2003), "Confessions on a Dance Floor" (2005) and "Hard Candy" (2008) with each disc housed in a cardboard sleeve. To complement the release of the box set, iTunes sold every Madonna studio album digitally for £3.95 for a limited period in the UK. On the same day as its release, Warner Bros. released another box set "Madonna: Original Album Series" which included five discs; the remastered version of "True Blue", "Like a Prayer", "Ray of Light", "Music" and "Confessions on a Dance Floor".
The box set also carries the logos for her other former record companies; Sire Records (1982–1995) and Maverick Records (1992–2004). It is her third greatest hits box set to be released after "The Royal Box" (1991) which was a limited edition of "The Immaculate Collection" (1990) and "CD Single Collection" (1996) which was released exclusively in Japan and included forty 3" CD singles, from "Burning Up" (1983) to "One More Chance" (1996), housed in a deluxe black glossy box.
Reception.
In the United Kingdom, the box set debuted at number seventy on the UK Albums Chart and sold 2,055 copies. Madonna's total for album sales for the 21st century in the United Kingdom is 7,279,423, making her one of the biggest selling acts of this period. In Japan it sold 13,000 copies and debuted at number nine (and "MDNA" at number four) making Madonna the first international female artist in Japanese chart history to have two albums in the top ten simultaneously and the first international artist in 20 years to achieve such feat, after Bruce Springsteen, who occupied two simultaneous top-ten albums in 1992 with "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town". With this feat, Madonna has accumulated 22 top-ten albums in Japan, more than any other international artist. It was certified gold in Poland.
Mike Diver from the BBC gave the box set a positive review, commenting that "this is pop history, a document of the most powerful female force in the music industry as she began her ascent, achieved superstar status, overcame a couple of hiccups, and ultimately landed in the 00s as every fledgling pop idol’s ultimate mother figure." He also mentioned the absence of tracks "Into the Groove" (only available on the 1985 reissue of "Like a Virgin"), "Vogue" (from 1990's "I'm Breathless" soundtrack) and "Justify My Love" (from 1990's "The Immaculate Collection") may disappoint some fans.
Track listing.
The box set consists of eleven studio albums from her career with Warner Bros. Records (1982–2009) and its divisions Sire Records (1982–1995) and Maverick Records (1992–2003).

Gibraltar–Spain border

The Gibraltar–Spain border is the international boundary between the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar and Spain. It is also referred to as (The frontier of Gibraltar) or simply as The Frontier.
The border runs east-west for a total of separating Gibraltar from the neighbouring Spanish municipality of La Línea de la Concepción. Since the United Kingdom is outside the European Union's Schengen Area, Gibraltar is too and therefore, identity checks are required to cross the border.
History.
The frontier has not always been marked by a barrier. In 1909 Britain was aware of the need to reduce the number of sentries and built a fence 7 ft (c. 2m) high, however there was suspicion about the motives for the fence.
Spain closed the border to vehicles in 1969 and again completely later on in the year following heightened tensions with Britain as a result of the disputed status of Gibraltar. The border was not fully reopened until February 1985.
In 2013, due to growing tensions between Gibraltar (backed by Britain) and Spain, the Spanish border control began to search every passing car, creating queues on both sides of the border which were several hours long.

Brian Sun

Brian Sun is an American trial lawyer and partner of the law firm Jones Day in the Los Angeles office. His areas of practice are white collar criminal defense, LA-based entertainment litigation, and political sagas, and has been involved in high profile criminal trials.
Early career.
Sun went to University of Southern California for both undergrad and law school. His work experience in law school included internships at the Securities and Exchange Commission and US Attorney's Office, both experiences helped him develop an interest in criminal law. After graduation he became an Assistant US Attorney, prosecuting drug crimes and related money laundering. The latter experience would be put to use when he gave Congressional testimony to Congress on the subject in 1982 and helped draft a bill to counter such money laundering.
Espionage and foreign government influence cases.
The Justice Department investigated fundraising activities related to the 1996 election campaigns, leading to allegations of a covert plot by the Chinese government to influence American politics. Sun represented Democratic Party fundraiser Johnny Chung one of the key figures subject to the investigation. Chung was charged with funneling illegal campaign contributions through use of straw donors for the Clinton reelection campaign. As part of a plea agreement, Chung plead guilty to charges of tax evasion, bank fraud, and conspiracy related to the illegal contributions and although faced with 37 years was able to avoid any prison time.
Sun formed part of the team that represented Wen Ho Lee, who in 2000 was accused by the US government of espionage. He led the civil suit side of legal efforts, charging the Department of Energy for violation of Lee's privacy in a lawsuit. The criminal case against Lee later ended with his release and an apology from the federal judge who presided over the proceedings to Lee for unfair treatment. Lee initiated his civil action against the government for invasion of privacy in 1999 and settled in 2006 for $1,645,000, with five media organizations paying for half the settlement amount. Sun noted to the "New York Times" that the settlement had the unusual stipulation imposed by the government that the government half of the settlement amount could not go to Lee but would instead go to pay "lawyers' fees, litigation costs, and taxes."
The particular expertise Sun gained in the Wen Ho Lee defense on the rules for the disclosure of classified information in criminal cases was put to use again in 2003 when he defended James J. Smith, a FBI counterintelligence agent on the China squad, who was charged with providing classified information to Katrina Leung, a businesswoman in Los Angeles.
The US Senate Subcommittee on Investigations published a report in 2010 detailing the findings of a probe on transfers of corruption tainted funds from African countries. Sun represented an American lawyer alleged by the committee to have helped the son of Equatorial Guinea President Teodoro Obiang Nguema in making transfers when the attorney was called to testify before the Senate panel.
Entertainment business law.
In "Blix Street Records v. Gelbard", a licensing dispute between Blix Street Records and Eva Cassidy Partners, a business partnership that included the parents of Eva Cassidy, Sun represented Eva Cassidy Partners.
Sun was criminal counsel to Elie Samaha during an FBI investigation tied to his dispute with Intertainment, a German financier of movies produced under his company Franchise Pictures.
White collar criminal defense.
In the wake of the 1994 Orange County bankruptcy, several public officials faced criminal and civil charges including Steve E. Lewis, the then auditor-controller of the county, who was represented by Sun.
Sun represented Mike Carona, a former sheriff of Orange County, who was put on trial for conspiracy and mail fraud charges. The government's case relied on damning statements made by Carona while taped by a government informant. Sun portrayed the statements made on the tapes as false chest thumping and argued the government witnesses were white collar felons looking to escape punishment by testifying against Carona. The outcome was favorable to Carona who was acquitted of five of the six charges and convicted of the remaining charge of witness tampering. Carona called the acquittals an "absolute miracle."

Tiberiu Dolniceanu

Tiberiu Dolniceanu (; born 3 April 1988 in Iaşi) is a Romanian sabre fencer, European champion in 2013 and bronze medal in the 2013 World championships. As part of Romania's sabre team, he won the team silver medal in the 2012 Summer Olympics and the team gold medal in the 2009 World Championships in Antalya. He is current number one in FIE rankings.
Biography.
Dolniceanu began fencing at age 13 under the coaching of Iulian Bițucă at CSM Iași. He took his first international podium in the Junior World Cup in Budapest in 2006. The same year, he earned a silver medal in the Junior World Championships in Poznań, after being defeated by future Olympic champion Áron Szilágyi. He took the bronze medal in the Junior European Championships in Prague in 2007 and reached number one in junior rankings in early 2008.
His progress was slower amongst seniors, but he joined the national sabre team. Along with Florin Zalomir, Cosmin Hâncianu, and Rareș Dumitrescu, Romania created a surprise by beating favourite Italy to win the gold medal in the 2009 World Championships in Antalya. For this performance, Dolniceanu and his team-mates received the Order of Sports Merit, class IIa. The same team went on to win the bronze in the 2010 World Championships in Paris. Dolniceanu transferred in 2011 to CS Dinamo București and began training under Mihai Covaliu, who also coaches the national team. He took part in the 2012 Summer Olympics, but was beaten in the second round by United States' Daryl Homer. In the team event, sixth-seeded Romania disposed of China 45–30 to meet Russia in the semi-finals. Dolniceanu gave his team a 20-17 lead, but a crash with Nikolay Kovalev awakened a right-ankle sprain sustained during the 2012 European Championships; he also broke a nail on his weapon hand and had to receive medical treatment. Romania were dominated 45-26 by South Korea in the final, Dolniceanu being the only one to win a bout, and took the silver medal.
Dolniceanu began the 2012–13 season with a silver medal in the Plovdiv Grand Prix. In the European Championships in Zagreb, he defeated 15–11 the three-time incumbent Aleksey Yakimenko of Russia to win the individual gold medal.

Betty Jane Cornett

Betty Jane Cornett (November 24, 1932 – March 18, 2006) was an infielder and pitcher who played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at 5' 5", 125 lb., she batted and threw right handed.
Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Betty Jane Cornett was the youngest of 11 children of Francis T. and Stella (née Bentz) Cornett. She attended St. Ambrose, St. Mary's, Latimer and Allegheny high schools. In her spare time, she went to Cowley Recreation Center on Troy Hill enjoying basketball, softball, swimming and ice skating. As a teenager, she was a member of the Pittsburgh Rockets basketball team, even though her favorite pastime was playing softball. She joined the league in 1950 with the Rockford Peaches.
After spring training camp, Rockford decided that Cornett was not ready for the league and sent her to the Springfield Sallies rookie touring team to acquire more experience. In 1951 she was promoted to the Kalamazoo Lassies and was dealt to the Battle Creek Belles before the 1952 season.
Originally an infielder, the Belles turned her into a pitcher for a couple of games with little success, as she posted an 11.26 earned run average in eight innings of work. She was best suited for the third base job, but she hit a paltry .147 average in 47 games and Battle Creek did not offer her a contract the next season.
″Curly″, as her teammates called her for her drooping hair, still wanted to play, so she had to wait five years to regain her amateur status again. Then she played successfully in Northwest Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania softball leagues until 1970.
Cornett also worked for H. J. Heinz Company in Pennsylvania during 24 years, retiring in 1987 after being diagnosed with CREST syndrome. After that, she was invited to several AAGPBL Players Association reunions. The association was largely responsible for the opening of "Women in Baseball", a permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, which was inaugurated in November 1988.
In addition, a photograph of Cornett in her wheelchair is featured at the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum next to an enlarged copy of her AAGPBL baseball card, while a second-floor display still holds her baseball glove, cap and spikes.
Betty Jane Cornett died in 2006 in Reserve, Pennsylvania at the age of 73, following complications from pulmonary disease.

Sacrilegium (video game)

Sacrilegium is a survival horror video game taking place in modern day Romania and follows a young woman named Alex across the world as she hunts down the Moroi (modern vampires).
Gameplay.
Multiple ranged weapons from handguns to crossbows are at Alex's disposal. The game will feature quick time events similar to "Heavy Rain", a chopper chase, and allow the player to ride a police motorbike. Stereoscopic 3D will be supported.
Plot.
The story follows a 20 year old woman and California college student named Alex across the world, from the misty shores of San Francisco to the fearsome and foreboding corners of the Old Continent. There Alex learns that assumptions can be lethally deceptive and that the seemingly safe modern world is but half of a chamber divided by a dark curtain... that beyond that opaque veil lies the embodiment of nightmares spawned into flesh.
Alone, surrounded, and trapped in darkness Alex is forced to face the Moroi, modern vampires. Thrust in the middle of a deadly plot filled with intrigue and betrayal, Alex must call upon her instincts, skills, knowledge and devotion to survive and make it out alive with her mind and soul intact—as well as save her friends.
Development.
The developers have stated that they hope to revive the survival horror genre by bringing back story and atmosphere. "Sacrilegium" will run on the Graphics Rendition and Creation Engine (GRACE) 2, a game engine developed by Reality Pump Studios. TopWare claims the improvements of GRACE 2 over GRACE on which "Two Worlds" ran will leave players "“awestruck.”" "“It pleased us that we succeeded developing the GRACE 2 engine in a way that enables us to present models and landscapes that make photos look like charcoal drawings compared to the game.”" said Miroslaw Dymek, CEO of Reality Pump Studios. "“After all the years that we‘ve dealt with the appearance of medieval stories, it was time to pool the experience acquired and integrate that into a modern action adventure. We’ve definitely achieved that with Sacrilegium.”"
The game will make use of motion-capture for body movement and facial expressions, acted out by professionals and martial arts experts, directed separately by film industry virtuosos. Every character and enemy has been given a unique and separately designed set of animations.

__NOTOC__
Seinpost is a restaurant located in Scheveningen, in the Netherlands. It is a fine dining restaurant that was awarded one Michelin star in the periods 1985-1989 and 2006–present. It held a Bib Gourmand at least in the period 2001-2003.
GaultMillau awarded the restaurant 17.0 out of 20 points.
The Head chef of "Seinpost" is Gert-Jan Cieremans. Cieremans had previously worked in the Michelin-starred Parkheuvel under Cees Helder, before becoming head chef at Seinpost in 1996. The head chef in the first Michelin period was Henk Savelberg.
A company named "Tartuffe Holding", comprising Henk Savelberg and a group of friends, set up Restaurant Seinpost in 1983. In 1989, they started "Vreugd en Rust" and Savelberg moved. As a consequence of Savelberg leaving, "Seinpost" lost its star.
In 1986, politician Ed Nijpels was an honorary commissioner of the company that ran "Seinpost". When he became minister, he had to give up all other positions he held, including this one. Unfortunately, "Seinpost" forgot to inform the Chamber of Commerce that Nijpels had given up his position, so a weekly magazine tried to create a row over it. The matter was soon defused.

Diocese of the Southeast

The Diocese of the Southeast is a Reformed Episcopal Church diocese and as such an Anglican Church in North America founding diocese. The diocese comprises 32 parishes, 30 in South Carolina and 2 in Georgia, in the United States. Its headquarters are located in Summerville, South Carolina. The current Bishop Ordinary is the Rt. Rev. Alphonza Gadsden and the Bishop Suffragan was the Rt. Rev. William White, who become Bishop Coadjutor on 10 January 2014.
History.
The Diocese of the Southeast, previously the Missionary Jurisdiction of the South, origin goes back to 1865, on the aftermath of the Civil War, with the work of Rev. Peter Fayssoux Stevens, a former Confederate colonel, a member of the Protestant Episcopal Church. He reunited former parishioners and many black freedmen and started working for the establishment of a new church for the coloured people, that would be Immanuel Church, in Berkeley County, South Carolina. Four years later, he already had organized three large congregations of freedmen.
In December 1874, in a convention held in Pinopolis, with members of four parishes, after the rejection of four black men from the ministry by the Protestant Episcopal Church, it was decided to leave the Diocese of South Carolina and to seek membership with the newly created Reformed Episcopal Church. In the same convention, Rev. Frank Crawford Ferguson was elected President and wrote to the Presiding Bishop of the Reformed Episcopal Church, George Cummins. In June 1875, he received a letter by the Rev. Benjamin Johnson, explaining that he had been sent by the General Council of the REC to receive all the black people willing to join the denomination. The new body would be the Missionary Jurisdiction of the South, named Diocese of the Southeast when the division into dioceses was adopted in 1984.
The diocese was a founding jurisdiction of the Anglican Church in North America, as part of the Reformed Episcopal Church, in 2009.
The Diocese of the Southeast is the home of the Cummins Theological Seminary, in Summerville, South Carolina.

List of rocket experiments on Zingst

Rocket Experiments.
During the Cold War, when the area was part of East Germany, the eastern part of the Zingst peninsula on the German Baltic Sea coast in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania was a restricted military area, used for meteorological rocket experiments. Various experiments were conducted between 1970 and 1992 in an area known as Sundi Meadows. There were 5 launches of the Polish rocket "Meteor 1E" in the early 1970s. On 21 October 1988 launches of Russian of the "MMR06-M" type rockets began. The restricted area measured just 23.6 kilometres by 25.5 kilometres. As the rockets reached heights up to 80 kilometres, the launch angle of the unguided rockets had to be determined with an accuracy of 2 degrees in order to prevent an impact outside the restricted area.
The first launches of MMR06-M rockets were not successful due to various technical difficulties. The first successful launch with a meteorological payload occurred on 12 April 1989. Additional launches continued for a short time after the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification (3 October 1990). They were finally ended on 19 December 1990 for safety and technological reasons.
Nevertheless, between 14 February and 10 April 1992 a total of 19 Russian rockets of the MMR06-M type were launched at Zingst, of which 6 were successful. Although further rockets were still available for testing, the launches of MMR06-M rockets in Zingst were stopped in April 1992 because of the removal of German Federal Armed Forces from the place.

The Whole Country is Red

The Whole Country is Red is a Chinese postage stamp, issued on 24 November 1968, which contained a design error. The stamp featured a map of China with the words "The Whole Country is Red" (Chinese: "全国山河一片红"), with a worker, farmer, and soldier standing below with copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao". The face value of the stamp is 8 "fēn" (1 US cent).
Taiwan was not shaded red as at the time of printing, it was (and remains so today) under the control of the Government of the Republic of China independent of the Communists. The official reason given for the withdrawal of the stamp was that the Spratly and Paracel Islands were missing from the map, as well as the borders with Mongolia, Bhutan, and Myanmar being incorrectly drawn. The stamp had been distributed for less than half a day when an editor at SinoMaps Press noticed the mistake and reported it to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. As a result, all Chinese post offices had to stop selling the stamp and return all copies, with only a small quantity making it to private collectors. The designer of the stamp, Wang Weisheng, said in an AFP interview, “For a long time I was really worried that I would be jailed”.
The stamp is today regarded as rare, with one being sold at an auction in 2009 for HK$3.68 million (US$475,000, £290,000). More recent auction realisations have been lower at £31050 in December 2010 (Stanley Gibbons) and HK$747,500 (£60,300) at InterAsia's September 2011 sale.

Ha'Cohen is the Rosh yeshiva of Yeshivat Otniel (Together with Rabbi Binyamin Kalmanzon) and the Rabbi of the Israeli settlement, Otniel.
Biography.
Ha'Cohen grew up in Jerusalem's Sha'arei Hesed neighborhood near Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and visited his home frequently. Ha'Cohen claims to be deeply influenced by Auerbach. Rav Re'em studied under Rav Arieh Binah at Netiv Meir Yeshiva high school and at Yeshivat Har Etzion, under Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein. Ha'Cohen received rabbinical ordination from Lichtenstein and from Rabbi Eliezer Waldenberg (the Tzitz Eliezer). Ha'Cohen was a Ra"m at Shevut Yisrael Yeshiva of Efrat and in Rav Haim Druckman's yeshiva, Or Etzion. In 1993, he joined Harav Beni Kalmanson to found and head Yeshivat Otniel. Since 1998, he has also served as Otniel's community rabbi.
Opinions.
According to Rav Re'em, the learning in the beit midrash must be connected to the outside world, as the inner parts of the Torah must be connected to the outer parts. For this reason, his teaching references many different sources ranging from academic and professional, to halachic and kabalistic sources.
Ha'Cohen thinks that it is legally binding to donate ones organs and have an organ donor card. He forbids smoking as a form of suicide. He requires his followers to wear techelet.

O. Perry Walker College and Career Preparatory High School and Community Center was a high school in Algiers, New Orleans, Louisiana. The school, which opened in 1970, was named after New Orleans teacher Oliver Perry Walker. It was originally controlled by New Orleans Public Schools. In fall of 2013, the original school building was closed, the school was merged with L.B. Landry High School, becoming what is now known as Landry-Walker College and Career Preparatory High School.
The school was on the west bank of New Orleans in Algiers.
History.
In 2005, as Hurricane Katrina was about to hit land, the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority (RTA) designated O. Perry Walker as a place where people could receive transportation to the Louisiana Superdome, a shelter of last resort.
In October 2012 there were plans to merge Walker and Landry High School. The RSD plans to move O. Perry Walker into the Landry building in 2013 and the campus would take the name of Walker High. The alumni of Landry High filed a lawsuit against the state, accusing it of ignoring a 2011 statute that asks the district to create a community outreach plan before finalizing "on any proposed changes in school governance" and unfairly calling Landry "low performing." The lawsuit was filed in District Civil Court in August 2012. The "Associated Press" stated "The case could be the first test of a law that requires community input on any changes in the way state-controlled schools are governed." The merge was successfully done in the fall of 2013. The school is now officially named Landry-Walker College and Career Preparatory High School. The current mascot is the Charging Bucks, deriving from the Chargers and the Buccaneers, previous mascots from O. Perry Walker and L.B. Landry respectively.

The 2010–11 season saw Dynamo Dresden challenge for promotion from the 3. Liga for the first time since its foundation in 2008. After shaky start, they found themselves in contention for third place, behind the top two of Eintracht Braunschweig and Hansa Rostock. When a poor run of form in March and April put this position into jeopardy, manager Matthias Maucksch was sacked and replaced with Ralf Loose. The change had the desired effect - Dynamo win five of their last six games (drawing the other), beating Kickers Offenbach on the last day of the season to secure third place, and a playoff with VfL Osnabrück, who had finished third bottom in the 2.

Mysterious (horse)

Mysterious (1970–1988) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse. In a racing career lasting from July 1972 until October 1973 she ran eight times and won five races. Mysterious won Group races on her first four racecourse appearances including the Classic 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse and Oaks at Epsom. She later finished second to Dahlia in the Irish Oaks at the Curragh and won the Yorkshire Oaks at York.
Background.
Mysterious was a chestnut filly with a narrow white blaze and white socks on her hind feet, bred in England by the California-based George Pope, Jr and raised at the Cliff Stud near Helmsley in Yorkshire. She was sired by the Epsom Derby winner Crepello out of Hill Shade an American-bred mare. Hill Shade won the Nassau Stakes and the Sun Chariot Stakes when trained in Britain and spent most of her breeding career in the United States where she produced several other winners including J. O. Tobin.
Mysterious was sent into training with Noel Murless at his Warren Place stables in Newmarket, Suffolk.
Racing career.
Mysterious bypassed maiden races, beginning her career in the Group Three Cherry Hinton Stakes over six furlongs at the Newmarket July meeting. She won the race from two opponents but did not appear again in 1972.
Mysterious made her first appearance as a three-year-old in the Group Three Fred Darling Stakes over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse. She defeated the Irish-trained favourite Grasse by three quarters of a length to take the event, a recognised trial for the 1000 Guineas. At Newmarket Mysterious was ridden as usual by Geoff Lewis and started at odds of 11/1, with the Cheveley Park Stakes winner Jacinth being made odds-on favourite. Lewis sent Mysterious into the lead two furlongs from the finish and she won decisively, beating Jacinth by three lengths. Her win gave Murless a sixth success in the race, setting a 20th century record.
At Epsom a month later, Mysterious started 13/8 favourite for the Epsom Oaks against nine other fillies. Lewis restrained the filly in the early stages, before moving up along the inside to take the lead in the straight. Mysterious retained her undefeated record, winning easily by four lengths from Where You Lead. Mysterious started 1/2 favourite for the Irish Oaks in July, but was beaten three lengths by the French-trained filly Dahlia. Later that month Dahlia was a six length winner of Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. In the Yorkshire Oaks in August, Mysterious won comfortably from Virunga, a French filly who had finished second to Dahlia in the Prix Saint-Alary.
Mysterious failed to reproduce her best form in her remaining two starts. She started odds-on favourite for the Sun Chariot Stakes but was beaten by Cheveley Princess, her only rival in a two-runner race. In October she finished sixth in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket.
Retirement.
Mysterious spent her breeding career in the United States where she was bred to leading stallions including Northern Dancer, Mr. Prospector and Nijinsky. She produced several winners, but nothing approaching top class. Her most successful descendant has been Quest, whose wins included the Clark Handicap.
Assessment and honours.
Mysterious was given a Timeform rating of 127.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Mysterious an "average" winner of the 1000 Guineas and Oaks.

Fundamental assessment

Functional assessment is an ongoing process collecting information to understand the reason under a problem or target behavior. The function of the assessment is to prove and aid the effectiveness of the interventions or treatments used to help eliminate the problem behavior. Through functional assessments we have learned that there are complex patterns to people's seemingly unproductive behaviors. It is important to not only pay attention to consequences that follow the behavior but also the antecedent that evokes the behavior. More work need s to be done in the future with functional assessment including balancing precision and efficiency, being more specific with variables involved and a more smooth transition from assessment to intervention.
Definition.
Functional assessment is a method developed by applied behavior analysis to identify the variables that maintain a problem behavior. Behavior is lawful. Whether it is desirable or undesirable, behavior is controlled by environmental variables. Behavior is a function of the antecedent and consequences that make up the three-term contingency. Functional assessment is the process of gathering information about the antecedent stimuli and consequences functional to the problem behavior. It attempts to provide an explanation to why the problem behavior may be occurring. The information about the antecedent stimuli may include the time and place, the presence of others and the frequency. The information collected helps identify which of the antecedent and consequences are maintaining the behavior. The information collected from functional assessment can also help develop appropriate treatments for the target behavior. Stimulus that may have been found to be reinforcing for the original behavior could be transferred to reinforce a more appropriate behavior.
Functions of problem behavior.
The purpose of conducting a functional assessment is to identify the function of the target behavior. There are four main classes of functions of problem behavior.
Social positive reinforcement.
Social positive reinforcement is when another person delivers a positive reinforcement after the problem behavior occurs. This is include the giving of attention, fun activities or goods and services provided by the person. An example of social positive reinforcement would be Max's mother (social) dropping what she is doing and provide attention (positive reinforcement) to her son when he engages in head banging on the wall (problem behavior).
Social negative reinforcement.
Social negative reinforcement is when another person delivers a negative reinforcement after the problem behavior occurs. The person may terminate an aversive stimuli (interaction, task or activity) and the behavior is more likely to be maintained. An example of social negative reinforcement would be Max complains (problem behavior) to his parents (social) when he is asked to do chores, as a result, his parents allows him to escape the task (negative reinforcement).
Automatic positive reinforcement.
Automatic positive reinforcement is when a positive reinforcement occurs automatically and is not mediated by another person. The behavior is strengthened by an automatic reinforcing consequence. An example of automatic positive reinforcement would be an autistic child waving his hands in front of his face (problem behavior) because the sensory stimulation (automatic positive reinforcement) produced is reinforcing for the child.
Automatic negative reinforcement.
Automatic negative reinforcement is when a negative reinforcement occurs automatically reducing or eliminating an aversive stimulus as a reinforcing consequence of the behavior. A popular example of automatic negative reinforcement would be binge eating. Binge eating (problem behavior) had been found to temporarily reduce any unpleasant emotions the person may be experiencing before the binge (automatic negative reinforcement).
Assessment methods.
There are various different methods used to conduct functional assessment, all of which falls into three distinct categories.
Indirect methods.
Indirect functional assessment methods use behavior interviews or surveys to gather information about the person exhibiting the behavior from themselves others who know this person well. The main advantage of indirect methods is they are easy and cheap to conduct and do not take much time. The main disadvantage of indirect methods is that the people involved are relying on their memories, thus some information may be lost or inaccurate.
Because of their convenience, indirect methods are used most commonly. It is essential assessment to be clear and objective as this will produce the most accurate answers without interpretation. The goal of the indirect assessment method is to generate information on the antecedent, behavior and consequence that can help generate a hypothesis about the variables that maintains the behavior.
Indirect methods can help develop a correlation hypothesis but not a functional relationship.
Direct observation methods.
Direct observation methods involve is present to observe and record the problem behavior as it occurs. The goal of direct observation is to record the immediate antecedent and consequences that functions with the problem behavior within a natural environment. The main advantage of direct observation is that the antecedents and consequences are recorded as it happens instead of recollection of memory. Therefore, the information recorded is generally more accurate. The main disadvantage of direct observation is it requires a considerable amount of time and effort to implement. Another thing about direct observation is, like indirect methods, it can only demonstrate a correlation but not a functional relationship.
The observer of the direct observation method should be present in the natural environment when the problem behavior is most likely to occur. The observer should also be trained to record the problem behavior and its functional antecedent and consequences immediately, correctly and objectively.
Direct observation can also be can ABC observation. Together with indirect methods, direct and indirect assessments are categorized as descriptive assessment because the antecedent and consequences are described from with memory of events. The information collected aids the development of a hypothesis, but to demonstrate a functional relationship, one must use the experimental method.
Experimental methods.
Experimental methods involve manipulating either the antecedent or consequent variables to determine their influence on the problem behavior. This is the only method that can demonstrate a functional relationship between the antecedent stimulus or the reinforcing consequence and the problem behavior. The main advantage of the experimental method is the demonstration of a functional relationship. The main disadvantage of the experimental method is the extensive use of time and effort to create an experiment.
Experimental methods can also be called experimental analysis or functional analysis.
"For more information please visit functional analysis."
Conducting a functional assessment.
A functional assessment should always be conducted before treating a problem behavior. To develop appropriate treatment, one must have the correct information about the antecedents and consequences controlling the behavior because treatment involves manipulating these environmental events to evoke a change in the problem behavior. Here is the proper procedure to correctly implement a functional assessment.
Functional interventions.
After a function assessment has been conducted with success, the information collected is used to develop appropriate treatments and interventions. Interventions are designed to manipulate the antecedent or/and the consequence of the problem behavior to decrease its occurrence rate and increase the rate of occurrence for more desirable behaviors.
Functional interventions include extinction, differential reinforcement and antecedent manipulations. These intervention are functional because they deal with the environmental events that are functional to the problem behavior. They are also nonaversive as punishment is not involved.
More aversive interventions can be used as latter resort if previous nonaversive intervention have been tried and shown ineffective. Punishment such as time-out and response cost are considered negative punishment, which although is still controversial, is more widely accepted than positive punishment such as overcorrection, contingent exercise, guided compliance and physical restraint. As mentioned punishment should only be used as a last resort when other methods have already been considered.
Research.
A lot of research being done with functional assessment deals with self injurious behaviors of mentally challenged children or adults and autistic children.
Carr, Newsom and Binkoff conducted an experimental method of functional assessment on the two boys with intellectual disabilities exhibiting aggressive behaviors. They hypothesized that their aggressive behaviors were maintained by escape from academic tasks. To test their hypothesis, they set two different experimental conditions; 1. Academic demands were put on the boys, 2. Academic demands were not put on the children. If their hypothesis is true, then the problem behavior should occur much more often in the first condition than the second. Results show that their hypothesis was indeed true as the aggressive behavior occurred at a much higher frequency in the first condition. The researchers concluded that the boy's problem behavior was indeed maintained by the antecedent of academic demands and the consequence of escape from the demands.
Another functional assessment research was done by Iwata in 1982 worked with children with developmental disabilities showing self injurious behaviors. The research could not conclude what was maintain their behavior but believed it either adult attention, escape from demands or sensory stimulation from the injuries. For each of the hypothesis, they created a condition that would fit into the category. For adult attention hypothesis, they created an environment where an adult is in the room with the child but pays no attention to him/her until after the behavior occurs. For the escape from demands hypothesis, they had an adult make a normal demand towards the child, but terminate it if the self injurious behavior occurs. For the sensory stimulation hypothesis, the child is left alone without the presence of anyone or any stimulating activities. Iwata compared the levels of self injurious behaviors across the three conditions and demonstrated that the function of the problem behavior for each child was different. Some wanted attention, others escape while some were maintained by automatic reinforcement. As shown here, it is very important to conduct a functional assessment to determine what exactly is maintaining the behavior before any function interventions are taken.

Kaleidoscope Dream

Kaleidoscope Dream is the second studio album by American R&B recording artist Miguel, released on September 25, 2012, by RCA Records. After attaining commercial standing with his 2010 debut album "All I Want Is You", Miguel wanted to play a larger creative role in his music and principally produced and wrote "Kaleidoscope Dream". He recorded most of the album at Platinum Sound Recording Studios in New York City and MJP Studios in Los Angeles, and worked with producers Warren "Oak" Felder, Jerry "Wonda" Duplessis, and Salaam Remi, among others.
An idiosyncratic album, "Kaleidoscope Dream" features sparse production, eccentric details, thick bass lines, buzzing synthesizers, and hazy, reverbed sounds. Its music incorporates R&B, pop, funk, rock, and soul styles, as well as electronic flourishes, psychedelic textures, and funk rock guitar. Lyrically, the album generally discusses sexual and romantic themes, with existential subject matter on some songs. Miguel titled "Kaleidoscope Dream" as a metaphor for life and sought to represent his own lifestyle and personality with its music and lyrics.
Prior to its release, the album's songs were previewed virally through a series of free digital EPs released by Miguel. It was also promoted with three singles, including Miguel's highest charting single "Adorn", and his touring in North America and Europe during 2012 to 2013. The album debuted at number three on the "Billboard" 200 with first-week sales of 71,000 copies and, as of February 20, 2013, has sold 321,400 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. "Kaleidoscope Dream" received rave reviews from music critics, who praised its eccentric style and Miguel's singing and songwriting, and was named one of the best albums of 2012 in several publications' year-end lists.
Background.
After it was shelved by Jive Records for two years, Miguel released his debut album "All I Want Is You" in November 2010. It initially performed poorly and was underpromoted by Jive, amid the label's dissolution. However, as its singles attained radio airplay and Miguel toured in its promotion, the album became a sleeper hit and helped him garner an audience and commercial standing. He also garnered a following with his fervent concert performances. After Jive was shut down and absorbed by RCA Records, Miguel acquired a new marketing team to develop himself as more than a typical urban artist, having felt pigeonholed into being marketed as one by Jive. He said that the experience of balancing creativity and business sense on his first album made him more confident in his approach on "Kaleidoscope Dream".
Miguel sought to reintroduce himself artistically with the album. Inspired by his more alternative musical influences, he wanted to change the sound and expectations of R&B songs on urban radio. He explained the album's title as "a metaphor for our life; everyone has their own "Kaleidoscope Dream", it is the life that they project and it is the life that they are solidifying with their conscious decision and their subconscious feelings." Miguel also said that the album represents the fantasies that are conveyed through dreams, which he felt embody "the purest form of fantasy we unleash through our subconscious ... the truest freedom we can experience. Totally unrepressed and totally creative."
Writing and recording.
Miguel worked on the album for approximately three months. He sought to play a larger creative role than he had on "All I Want Is You", and produced most of "Kaleidoscope Dream" and either wrote or co-wrote every song on the album. He recorded most of the album at Platinum Sound Recording Studios in New York City and MJP Studios in Los Angeles; the songs "Arch & Point" and "Gravity" were recorded at Gustavo's Golden Gloves Gymnasium in Los Angeles. He spent almost two years in New York City, which he felt let him explore "the edgy side" of his life and consequently made his sonical approach grittier, saying in an interview for "The Village Voice", "I'm not the 'go to the club and pop bottles' kind of guy. That's not my lifestyle. I really like to party, but it's ... just darker. I'm looking for the speakeasy on the Lower East Side that has a secret door and a password." Miguel recorded "Adorn" in 2011 in the bedroom of his Los Angeles apartment, which he used as a makeshift studio at the time. Parts of the album were edited by Miguel and his engineers using Pro Tools.
Miguel wanted the album to be "a pure and honest projection of my lifestyle and my kaleidoscope dream", and used the music's pace and sound to represent his lifestyle and the lyrics to represent his personality. To sustain his creative approach, Miguel avoided media outlets that he usually visited for music, including radio and Internet blogs. He drew on musical influences from early in his life, including classic rock, country rock, and funk, to incorporate rock flourishes on the album. He also incorporated the Roland TR-808 to give the music a distinct percussive feel. He enlisted an orchestra and incorporated string arrangements, along with a drum loop, to the album's title track, which he felt aurally defined the moods of his personality. Miguel also worked with previous collaborators Salaam Remi and Nathan "Happy" Perez, among other producers. Recording artist Alicia Keys sang background vocals on the song "Where's the Fun in Forever", Elle Varner co-wrote "Use Me", and Brook D'Leau of J*Davey played keyboards on "Candles in the Sun".
Apart from sexual themes, Miguel wrote about conversational and existential topics. When writing "Pussy Is Mine", he drew on his sexual behavior as a single man and "moments of power and vulnerability" with a sexually promiscuous woman. Miguel originally wrote "Where's the Fun in Forever" with Alicia Keys for her 2012 album "Girl on Fire" at a recording studio in Jamaica. He conceived the song while spending time with Keys on the roof of the studio, which he recounted in an interview for MTV News: "ll I had was this amazing blanket of stars in the sky and the sound of waves in the distance, great vibe ... So here I am trying to be creative for Alicia and it just dawned on me: Well, what if we did live forever? Could we have accomplished all of these amazing things? Would we have come so far? ... Would we have come up with all these theories or built all of these amazing, amazing architectural beautiful things ... or would we have been lazy?" The album's title track was written by Miguel while he was working on "All I Want Is You". In reaction to Jive's request for more conventional R&B songs, he composed the song with unusual lyrics and without a hook, chorus, or form.
Music and lyrics.
An idiosyncratic album, "Kaleidoscope Dream" incorporates R&B, pop, funk, rock, and soul genres. It features sparse production, eccentric details, thick bass lines, buzzing synthesizers, and hazy, reverbed sounds. Allmusic's Andy Kellman finds the album "funkier and weirder" than "All I Want Is You" and observes an "illusory atmosphere ... intensified by some unexpected touches". Music journalist Maura Johnston comments that much of it "sounds, as the title might suggest, fractal." Stylistically, its music is characterized by electronic flourishes, psychedelic textures, and funk rock guitar. Music journalist Greg Kot writes that the album "blends the raw and the refined; everything from 808 drum machines to orchestras figure in the mix." Miguel sings with expressive falsetto and tenor registers on the album. Alfred Soto of The Quietus observes a "joy" in his singing that "leavens the often brooding nature" of the music.
As an R&B album, "Kaleidoscope Dream" deviates from genre conventions by minimizing the influence of hip hop, and drawing heavily on psychedelic rock and pop. Music writers compare the album's style to Prince, particularly his mid-1980s works such as "Darling Nikki" (1983) and "Around the World in a Day" (1986). Alex Macpherson of "The Guardian" perceives a "headier aesthetic" than on "All I Want Is You", with "faded psychedelia" and "intimate experiments in "Purple Rain"-esque rock". In an interview for the "Chicago Tribune", Miguel said that he "definitely think it's an R&B record, though other people may not," feeling that listeners "are so conditioned to expect certain things out of current R&B, and it's about following a formula. But R&B was once live music, it was psychedelic, it was rock, it was funk, and all these genres stem from soul music ... There would be no hip-hop or rock without R&B. It was important for me to be true to what R&B is, and that is soulful."
The album's lyrics generally deal with themes of adult love, meaningful sex, and romance. Andrew Ryce of Pitchfork Media interprets its "overarching theme" to be "the highly sexualized seen through the lens of the eager and innocent." Miguel's lyrics express modesty, yearning, vulnerability, and cheeky humor. NPR's Frannie Kelley likens his songwriting to Tony! Toni! Toné! and observes "Little Richard-level insinuations" and "absurd provocations in the style of Akinyele". Music journalist Jim DeRogatis views that Miguel eschews braggadocio and is "man enough to admit his own insecurities and question whether he's worthy of love—or lustful indulgence." "Kaleidoscope Dream" also explores the anxiety and momentary nature of sex and clubbing. Consequence of Sound's Jeremy D. Larson views that Miguel employs a "fangs-out approach to R&B" similar to Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, writing that "nothing shrouds Miguel and his directives, and worries, and prayers, and cat calls – it's all there, full of light and love, refracting through a kaleidoscope of rocks glasses, rainy windshields, and blood-shot eyes."
Songs.
"Adorn" has both digital and analog sensibilities, and lyrics comprising brazen declarations of affection, including promises of adoration to a female subject. "Don't Look Back" features amplified bass, bombastic drums, and metallic synths. Rob Markman of MTV News writes that the song "represents the morning after when the reality of the previous night's efforts creep in." Its closing interlude has Miguel crooning lyrics from The Zombies' 1969 song "Time of the Season" over sentimental synths and musky, psychedelic music. "Use Me" features hollow, electronic sounds, heavily multitracked vocals, metronomic rhythms, and an industrialized mix of guitar and percussion. Its lyrics blur expressions of sexual nerves with gentle dominance, as the narrator instructs his lover how she can toy with him, An atmospheric pop rock song, "Do You..." portrays a narcotic tryst and mixes ambiable come-ons with drug imagery. The psychedelic title track incorporates synthesizer arpeggios, minor chords, oscillating blips, fuzzy guitar, and a bassline interpolation of Labi Siffre's 1975 "I Got The". The sample's groove is played at a different tempo than other instruments on the song. The song's lyrics feature synesthetic imagery ("I taste you, infinite colors"), and a boast by the narrator about kissing his subject's third eye.
"The Thrill" has a sparse bass groove, layered keyboards, and existential lyrics with YOLO imagery. "How Many Drinks?" has sardonic, swaggering lyrics and a rap verse by Miguel, who veers between seducer and user. "Where's the Fun in Forever" features atmospheric drums and bass, an a cappella bridge, and rolling dynamics with measures that advance an argument. The song celebrates youthful bliss and preachs a carpe diem philosophy. It transitions into the rock song "Arch & Point", which has sexually charged ballet metaphors and bare power pop elements. "Pussy Is Mine" features a high vocal range by Miguel, a rudimentary chord progression played on electric guitar, and a stripped, demo quality. The song is about sexual jealousy and an ignoble man's plea for exclusivity in a casual relationship. Its sexually explicit, bawdy lyrics eschew masculine hip hop tropes for feelings of insecurity. The song is bookended by background studio chatter. "Candles in the Sun" is a slow burning, political soul song. It touches on senseless killings, drug-infested communities, and questions the existence of God and the motives of governments. Chris Kelly of "Fact" writes that, along with "Adorn", "Candles in the Sun" "bookend the album with another tribute to Marvin Gaye, a la 'What's Going On?'"
Promotion.
After pitching the strategy to RCA, Miguel marketed "Kaleidoscope Dream" virally with a three-volume series of EPs entitled "Art Dealer Chic", which were released as free downloads during February to April 2012 and previewed songs from the album. He released two more EPs—"Kaleidoscope Dream: Water Preview" on July 31 and "Air Preview" on September 11— to digital retailers. In an interview for "The Village Voice", Miguel said that the strategy allowed listeners to absorb the songs at his desired pace and called it "a great way for me to reconnect with my peers ... the people that I hang out with—that go to the same shows, listen to the same music, read the same blogs, same magazines."
Miguel embarked on a short promotional tour in the United States on September 26. He also promoted the album with television performances on "106 & Park", "The Wendy Williams Show", "Late Show with David Letterman", and "Jimmy Kimmel Live!". He subsequently toured in support of the album for six months throughout North America and Europe, including concert dates as a supporting act on Trey Songz' Chapter V World Tour during November 2012 to February 2013, and a headlining tour in the UK and Ireland during January 2013. Miguel opened for Alicia Keys on her Set The World On Fire Tour during March and April. Although he did not choreograph his shows, he routinely rehearsed in a dance studio and practiced singing in front of a mirror. In concert, he performed dramatic leaps, staggers, and other moves fashioned after Little Richard and James Brown. He started ripping his shirt off during performances after being inspired by Songz' concerts.
Commercial performance.
"Kaleidoscope Dream" was first released by RCA in vinyl LP format on September 25 to make the deadline for the Grammy Awards' eligibility period without charting prematurely on lower sales. The following week, it debuted at number three on the "Billboard" 200 on sales of 71,000 copies. It sold 30,000 copies in its second week on the chart. In the United Kingdom, the album charted for 15 weeks on the UK R&B Chart, peaking at number 13. It was Miguel's first album to be released in the UK.
The album's lead single "Adorn", which had been released on August 7, became a sleeper hit on urban radio. It was Miguel's second number-one single on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, and his highest charting single on the "Billboard" Hot 100 at number 17. By September, the single had sold 190,000 copies. According to NPR's Audie Cornish, Miguel "broke through to a national audience in 2012" with both "Adorn" and "Kaleidoscope Dream". The second single "Do You..." was released on September 18, and reached number 32 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.
By November 21, the album had sold 180,900 copies. On March 3, 2013, "How Many Drinks?" was released as its third single. By February 20, "Kaleidoscope Dream" had charted for 20 weeks on the "Billboard" 200 and sold 321,400 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.
Critical reception.
"Kaleidoscope Dream" received rave reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 86, which indicates "universal acclaim", based on 20 reviews. Allmusic's Andy Kellman dubbed it "2012's most pleasurable pop-R&B album" and felt that, although the lyrics occasionally veer "too close to 'artsy' teenage erotic poetry," each song has "an attractive quality, whether it's a heavenly melody, a riveting rhythm, or a boggling production nuance." Greg Kot of the "Chicago Tribune" complimented both his "left turns" and older influences, writing that he "creates a fluid, dreamscape environment that floats across eras with a connoisseur's discerning feel for the telling detail." Alex Macpherson of "The Guardian" found Miguel's occasional "appeal to indie tropes" balanced by "genuinely thoughtful songwriting", and commended him for using his commercial breakthrough "as a springboard to radically change course". "Spin" magazine's Maura Johnston was impressed by his singing and songwriting, and called the album "startling and invigorating, a fully formed statement from an artist hungrily surging toward the front of pop music's creative pack." Sean McCarthy of PopMatters wrote that, along with Frank Ocean's "Channel Orange", it "shows that in terms of mainstream music, the trailblazers of 2012 are firmly entrenched in the R&B community." Randall Roberts of the "Los Angeles Times" felt that the "searing" album "offers further evidence of a genre being reborn in 2012."
In a mixed review, Ken Capobianco of "The Boston Globe" felt that "some tracks are simply overproduced" and found Miguel "too remote for a true soul singer." Jon Caramanica of "The New York Times" found the album to be "purposefully, a little washed-out, a blend of Prince-isms and slurry grooves", and stated, "Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's on the verge." Frannie Kelley of NPR critiqued that the album "requires a few twists to bring Miguel's vision into focus", but commended his effort as a "perfectionist" and found him comparable to "Stevie Wonder, Prince and Van Morrison." Pitchfork Media's Andrew Ryce found the album to be "respectful of tradition, quietly ambitious, and deeply personal", and cited Miguel as "the rare vocalist who makes you "feel" what he's singing about, even when his lyrics can be transparent." Alfred Soto of The Quietus was pleasantly surprised by "the range of sonic ideas, fully realized songs, and prodigious vocal talent" by Miguel after a "tentative" debut and commented that he "articulates how a love man can be louche without being a douche."
Accolades.
"Kaleidoscope Dream" appeared on several critics' year-end top albums lists. Music critic Ann Powers named it the best album of the 2012. The album was also ranked number 26 by Robert Christgau, number 23 by Pitchfork Media, number 13 by "The A.V. Club", number 12 by the "Chicago Sun-Times" and "Exclaim!", number 11 by "The Guardian", number 10 by the "Chicago Tribune", number eight by "Slate", number six by the "Los Angeles Times", number five by Allmusic, Okayplayer, and "Spin", number four by "Entertainment Weekly", number three by "Billboard", "New York", and "Now", and number one by Idolator. Metacritic named it the 12th best-reviewed album of 2012.
The album was voted the fifth best album of 2012 in "The Village Voice"s annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll. In an essay for the poll, the newspaper's Brian McManus wrote that the album's "raw bits of sexuality and frank freak talk were absent in much of r&b in 2012" and called it "a fantastical, steamy, colorful, gritty-but-polished, polished-but-gritty, dripping-with-sex-sweat bacchanal of Marvin Gaye smoothness." "Kaleidoscope Dream" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album. "Adorn" was nominated for Best R&B Performance and Song of the Year, and won for Best R&B Song at the 2013 Grammy Awards.

Karl Gotthelf von Hund

Karl Gotthelf, Baron von Hund und Altengrotkau (1 September 1722, Unwürde - 10 October 1776, Meiningen) was a German freemason. In 1751, he founded the Rite of Strict Observance.
Childhood and youth.
Karl Gotthelf von Hund came from Silesia, descended from Henry von Hund und Altengrotkau (ca 1480). Henry's son was Commander of the Order of Malta in Glatz, where in 1518 and 1523 he held the Office of the Governor. Documents from around 1300 show John and Christopher von Hund, but it is not proven that they belong to the line that later became Altengrotkau. Karl Gotthelf's father, Joachim Hildebrand von Hund was chamberlain and Electoral Saxon landowner. The family of von Hund and Altengrotkau owned their estate from 1607 and from 1704 the estate of Upper Kittlitz in Upper Lusatia. Karl's father died very early, so that his still minor son inherited the estate. The guardianship of the son and his mother fell to Caspar Heinrich von Rodewitz. Karl Gotthelf was the youngest of three children, but his elders died before his birth, so that he was entitled to special care and a good teaching. He studied in Leipzig from 1737 to 1739. Then he joined the Army under the command of Colonel Friedrich von Schoenberg. Because of the death of his beloved, the daughter of his guardian, von Hund decided never to marry. Hund became chamberlain to the elector of Cologne.
First contacts with Freemasonry.
In 1741 Hund was at the coronation of Charles VII in Frankfurt, where he was admitted to the Masonic brotherhood. From December 1742 till September 1743 he was in Paris, and there converted to Catholicism under the influence of a noble lady. Here, on 20 February 1743, he became Master of a lodge. On 25 August 1743 he served at the foundation of a lodge as senior warden.
Later, he claimed that it was in Paris in 1743 that he was initiated, by Scottish knights, into the Order of the Knights Templar, and was the introduced to the pretender to the British throne, Prince Charles Edward Stuart as the Grand Master of the (supposedly resurrected) Knights Templar. Present were the Earl of Kilmarnock and other senior Jacobites. He was initiated by the "Knight of the Red Feather, whose identity he was pledged to conceal, but he may have tried to hint that it was Charles Edward Stuart. There is no documentary proof of any such Masonic lodge. Hund claimed to have been appointed by these "unknown superiors" of the Templars as "commander in chief" (Provincial Grand Master) of the Order of Province VII (Germany). Whether he lied or whether he had been deceived for other purposes, is not known. As proof, he presented an encoded "military chief patent", which remains undeciphered. Hund wrapped himself in silence and in more detailed inquiries repeatedly underlined his discretion with respect to the "unknown superiors", who had supposedly charged him with the revival of the Templar Order in Germany. Hund's relationship to the alleged French Templar Order is unclear, and his surviving diary entries give little information.
Masonic work.
In 1749 Hund established the Lodge of Three Columns on his estate at Unwuerde in association with the brothers of the neighboring Lodge of Three Hammers at Naumburg. After returning to Germany in 1750 Hund settled in Lower Kittlitz. The castle of Kittlitz, built by him, has an octagonal floor plan, which is interpreted as a Masonic symbol. After several failed attempts, the court of the pretender Charles Edward Stuart was contacted, and the establishment of the seventh province of the Templars taken in hand. From 1751 he founded the Rite of Strict Observance within Freemasonry. He always promoted the idea of a line of descent from the Templars to the Freemasons. First he founded in 1751 on his estate, the Strict Observance chapter of "The three pillars", which initially consisted of only him and his best childhood friend from Schoenberg. In 1755 he created for the community of the Knights Templar a plan of operations for the recruitment of persons of high rank. Its members gave themselves religious-sounding names. Hund had the name Carolus Eques ab Ense (Latin for Charles Knight of the Sword) or Chevalier de l'Épée (same in French).
The Rite of Strict Observance.
The new Scottish Rite that Hund introduced to Germany, he named "Rectified Masonry" and, after 1764, the "Rite of Strict Observance", while referring to the English system of Freemasonry as the "Late Observance".
In 1764 Hund's estate had been badly affected by the Seven Years' War, and his confidence was damaged by his inability to contact his Jacobite superiors for certification of his position and ritual. He was contacted by George Frederick Johnson, who had been accepted by the lodge at Jena as their masonic mentor, and now claimed superiority over all other lodges in Germany and Bohemia. Those who accepted his rule had their own charters and papers burned, and their leaders re-initiated (at some expense) into Johnson's system of higher degrees. Hoping that Johnson was his desired link to his own missing superiors, Hund agreed to meet, and Johnson brought his entire entourage, with representatives of his subordinate lodges. However, Johnson's bizarre behaviour, and his failure to produce promised material, convinced both Hund and his own people that he was a fraud. He was later found to be a German confidence trickster called Johann Samuel Lechte. When their discredited mentor left, his lodges turned to Hund as the unexpected hero of the hour, who now found himself at the head of a movement.
The Rite appealed to German national pride, attracted the non-nobility, and was allegedly directed by "Unknown Superiors". The Rite of Strict Observance was particularly devoted to the reform of Masonry, with special reference to the elimination of the occult sciences which at the time were widely practiced in many lodges, and the establishment of cohesion and homogeneity in Masonry through the enforcement of strict discipline, the regulation of functions, etc.
Despite its initial popularity, growing dissatisfaction among members over the failure to being initiated into the mysteries of the Unknown Superiors led to the Strict Observance being dissolved in 1782. They decided at a convent in Wilhelmsbad, under Jean-Baptiste Willermoz, that the Freemasons were not descended from the Templars, and reconstituted the order as the Rectified Scottish Rite
Hund's Legacy.
From today's perspective Hund was not a charlatan, like many of his contemporaries. It is clear that Hund had been enthusiastic and relatively easy to influence. Even as a young man he loved the poets of antiquity and all the ideals of the chivalric spirit. He worshiped chivalric ideals, which in other high-level systems of Freemasonry of the 18th Century were strongly expressed. Hund preached with enthusiasm, all his mature life, the mistaken view that Freemasonry sprang from the alleged remnant of the Templar Order, and strove to resurrect it. Masonic historians considered Hund to be a man of kindness and brotherhood, who sacrificed everything for his ideals. He could have led a life of prosperity, and risen to prominence in court and state. In all this he resigned in favour of religious thought. He suffered pains, hostility and persecution until his death, always in the mistaken view that he had become an emissary of the Knights Templar. Challenged at the 11th Convention of Brunswick (June 1775) about the "unknown superiors" who allegedly introduced him in Paris to the system of the Strict Observance, Hund is said to have assured his questioners, with tears, that his oath and his conscience forbade reply.
For Freemasonry and the system he established, the Strict Observance, he sacrificed a lot of time, money and almost his entire estate. With what sacrifice he persevered in his teaching is shown when, already very ill, in 1776 he traveled to Meiningen to persuade the reigning Duke Friedrich August to adopt the Strict Observance. Shortly after, he died of "a fever" and was buried in full regalia in the town church of Mellrichstadt (Bavaria). He wore his Army Master ring with the initials N.V.I.O., i.e., "nulla vi invertur ordo" ("No power can overthrow the Order"), the motto of the Strict Observance.

Alexey Alexandrovich Glagolev

Alexej Alexandrovich Glagolev (Russian: Алексей Алекса́ндрович Глаго́лев) (2 July 1901 – 23 January 1972) - Ukrainian Orthodox priest, honoured as one of the Righteous among the Nations.
Family and education.
Alexej Glagolev was born to a family of Alexander Glagolev, the priest and professor of Kiev Theological Academy. His father died in Kiev prison in 1937. His mather, Zinaida Petrovna (née Slesarskaya) was a daughter of the head librarian of Kiev Theological Academy. He had a brother named Sergei and a sister named Varavara.
Alexej graduated with distinction from a high school in Kiev. Between 1919 and 1923 he studies at the Kiev Theological Academy. Throughout this period the Academy was shut by Bolsheviks and worked illegally. In 1926 he married Tatiana Pavlovna, née Bulashevich, a daughter of the owner of the sugar plant. They were both members of the Kiev religious community of the priest Anatole Zhurakovsky. Their children: Magdalina (born 1926) and Maria (born 1943).
Life in 1930s.
On the 7th of May 1932 Alexej Glagolev was arrested and accused of acting against revolution. In one week's time he was set free but had no vote rights as a son of "cult worker" (Soviet term for a priest). He worked at the constructions side, security in the nursery at the jam factory. In 1936 he started the degree in Physics and Mathematics in Kiev Pedagogy Institute, graduated in 1940. He continued secretly working in an underground church.
Priest.
In 1941, after the Great Patriotic War began, he was made a priest by Archbishop Veniamin (Novitsky) and served in the Pokrov Church in Kiev.
Saving Jews during the Nazi Occupation.
During the Nazi occupation of Ukraine in the Second World War, Glagolev and his family were saving Jews from the Nazis. Glagolevs hid Jews in their own home and homes of their congregants. Alexej also gave Jews fake christening birth certificates left from his father, priest Alexander Glagolev. Once Alexej's wife Tatiana changed the photo in her own passport and gave it to a Jewish woman which was in hiding. Father Alexej wrote about this episode in his memoirs: "My wife almost paid with her own life for her reckless action. Gestapo walked flat to flat for requisitions. They asked for her papers and when they found out that she did not have a passport, they were going to arrest her and take to Gestapo. Very few people returned to their homes after such arrests. We begged and just about managed to persuade them to leave her alone, a few witnesses having identified her identity."
They also managed to save a family of a Russian Red Army lieutenant colonel - his wife and six kids. Glagolev family took a huge risk, hiding Jews was punished by execution, but they continued doing it despite Tatiana's pregnancy (she gave birth to Maria in 1943).
In 1943 Alexej worked in the hospital church in Pokrov Monastery. He stayed in Podil with the people he was hiding despite the demands of German administration to leave this part of Kiev. In Autumn of 1943 he was detained by German authorities, twice beaten up and deported to Germany with his son, but they managed to escape. In 1945 he wrote a detailed letter about the Jews he has saved to the First Secretary of the Central Committee of Ukraine Nikita Khrushchev.
After the War.
After the war Glagolev carried on working as a priest in the Pokrov church until its closure in 1960. Then he worked in few other churches. Towards the end of his life he was very ill as a result of beatings by Nazis in 1943 and underwent several surgeries.
The journalist Sergei Kokurin in his article «Glagolev: the hard truth» characterized Alexej Glagolev as follows:
It is hard to understand to an average man the determination with which Glagolev went against the tide. <...> In 1936 this fragile-looking intellectual was publicly carrying the cross taken off a Church of Nikola the Kind and despite the threats from Komsomol members kept it in his flat. He was the only priest in Kiev that refused in April 1942 to hold a church service to celebrate Hitler's birthday. He was not afraid in 1946 to host in the church the family ordered by Court to leave Kiev within 24 hours, because NKVD officer occupied their flat.
Memory of Alexej Glagolev.
On September 12, 1991, Yad Vashem recognized Aleksej and Tatyana Glagolev, and their daughter, Magdalina (Mariya) Palyan, as Righteous Among the Nations.
On October 8, 2000, Yad Vashem recognized Nikolay Glagolev as Righteous Among the Nations. Nikolay who served as a messenger between his parents and the people being saved.
On the 30th of January 2002 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Alexej Glagolev's birth, the memorial plaque to Alexander Glagolev and Alexej Glagolev was erected on the wall of National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy (Volshskaja Street 8/5, korpus 4).

Ross Chisholm (born 19 October 1990 in Cuckfield, England), is a rugby union player for Harlequins in the Aviva Premiership. He is a Fullback, also playing on the Wing.
Chisholm started playing rugby at Haywards Heath RFC, his talent earning him a place in Harlequins Elite Player Development Group and then promotion to the senior Academy. He was selected to play in two senior pre-season matches in 2009 before making his first team debut later that year against Newcastle Falcons in the LV Cup. He continued developing and in January 2011 signed his first senior contract.
The 2011/12 season saw Chisholm make his first Premiership start in the opener against London Irish, playing on the wing. The constant presence of Mike Brown at Fullback and stiff competition on the wings limited Chisholm's first team game time, but he did make 11 senior appearances (including 4 Premiership starts) in the season, scoring 5 tries. His last try was scored in the dying moments of an away loss against Gloucester (his second that match), it secured Quins a losing bonus point and Chisholm a nomination for RPA 'Try of the Year'.
His development has severely hampered by serious injuries which have limited his chances to play for the 1st XV

Award criteria.
The award of the Peace Officer Exemplary Service Medal is governed by an Advisory Committee, appointed by the Governor General of Canada, made up from a representative from each organization with personnel eligible for the medal. This committee ensures that personnel nominated for the medal meet all of the criteria for award, as spelled out by regulation, before forwarding the nomination to the Chancellery of Honours. 
Peace officers are eligible for award of the Exemplary Service Medal if they meet various criteria. First among the criteria is the requirement that the employee of an approved organization was actively serving on or after 22 September 1998, and has completed at least twenty years of service with one or more approved organizations. Eligible periods of service must include protecting the safety and security of Canada, with at least ten years served as a peace officer serving at potential risk as determined by the Advisory Committee. The recognized period of service of a nominee for the medal must be of a character that no serious disciplinary action was taken against a nominee and none may be pending. Nominees are expected to have a record of exemplary service of a high standard warranting recognition. Those personnel who are already recipients of the Peace Officer Exemplary Service Medal, may be awarded a bar to the medal for ten additional years of qualifying service.
No period of service previously recognized by any other long service, good conduct or efficiency decoration or medal awarded by the Monarchy of Canada may be used for the award of the medal. However, full-time exemplary service in the Canadian Forces or in any other occupation eligible for award of an Exemplary Service Medal may count as qualifying service, if the service has not been previously recognized.
Extraordinary award criteria.
The Advisory Committee may recommend an award of the Peace Officer Exemplary Service Medal to the Governor General under extraordinary circumstances. The subject of this recommendation need not meet the criteria of length of service. This recommendation may be for a posthumous award, if the person died in the line of duty and was not the recipient of any other award from the Monarchy of Canada directly related to the circumstances of his or her death.
Eligible organizations.
The Governor General maintains a list of organizations eligible to present the Peace Officer Exemplary Service Medal to its personnel. The Advisory Committee may also recommend adding any other federal or provincial organization employing peace officers. The following organizations are eligible to present the medal:
Appearance.
The Peace Officer Exemplary Service Medal is circular, made of silver colored metal, in diameter. The obverse of the medal depicts a maple leaf with a star and shield superimposed upon the center. Circumscribed around the medal are the words "Exemplary Service — Services Distingués". The areas between the edge of the medal and the maple leaf are cut out. The reverse depicts the crowned cypher of the monarch. The recipients name is engraved on the edge of the medal. 
The medal is suspended by a stylized inverted fleur-de-lis on a straight suspension bar. The ribbon of the medal is wide and with a central dark green stripe, bordered by gold, then bordered by a thinner stripe of light blue and a thinner stripe of dark blue at the edges.

Zingster Strom

The Zingster Strom is a distinctive, river-like arm of the Barther Bodden lagoon, south of the Zingst peninsula on Germany's Baltic Sea coast. It lies between the island of Kirr and the Zingst and runs from east to west in a semi-circular arc, both ends being open to the south. It is less than one hundred metres wide in places and about three kilometres long. Unlike its rather shallow neighbouring waterbodies it is over six metres deep in places. At its northernmost point lies the village of Zingst with its harbour and a water fowl roosting area. Two smaller islands, Brunstwerder and Gänsebrink, are located in the Strom. The Strom used to have direct access to the Baltic via the "Alte Stramminke", a former inlet.

__NOTOC__
The Fleetwings PQ-12 was a 1940s American manned aerial-target designed and built by Fleetwings for the United States Army Air Corps.
The PQ-12 was a single-engined monoplane with a Lycoming O-435 piston engine. It had a fixed nose-wheel landing gear, twin vertical tails and an open-cockpit was provided for manned flight. Instead of the optional pilot a 500 lb (225 kg) bomb could be carried in the cockpit. The original prototype was cancelled but a modified variant was built followed by eight test aircraft, although an order for 40 production aircraft was placed it was subsequently cancelled.

Age and female fertility

Age and female fertility encompasses a woman's fertility as affected by her age. A woman's fertility peaks in the early and mid-20s, after which it starts to decline, with advanced maternal age causing an increased risk of female infertility. This is popularly referred to as a woman's "biological clock". Another risk that increases significantly into the mother's midlife is chromosomal abnormalities, to include Down syndrome.
Quantification of effect.
The average age of a girl's first period (menarche) is 12 to 13 (12.5 years in the United States, 12.72 in Canada, 12.9 in the UK) but, in postmenarchal girls, about 80% of the cycles are anovulatory in the first year after menarche, 50% in the third and 10% in the sixth year. A woman's fertility peaks in her early and mid-20s, after which it starts to decline, with this decline being accelerated after age 35. However, the exact estimates of the chances of a woman to conceive after a certain age are not clear, with research giving differing results. The chances of a couple to successfully conceive at an advanced age depend on many factors, such as the general health of a woman and the fertility of the male partner.
According to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, for women aged 35, about 94 out of every 100 who have regular unprotected sexual intercourse will get pregnant within 3 years of trying. For women aged 38, however, only 77 out of every 100 will do so.
According to Henri Leridon, PhD, an epidemiologist with the French Institute of Health and Medical Research, of women trying to get pregnant, without using fertility drugs or in vitro fertilization 
According to a study done on a sample of 782 healthy European couples ages 19–39, fertility starts declining after age 27 and drops at a somewhat greater rate after age 35. The women were divided into four age groups: 19–26, 27–29, 30–34 and 35–39. Statistical analysis showed that the women in the 27–29 age group had significantly less chance on average of becoming pregnant than did the 19– to 26-year-olds. Pregnancy rates did not change notably between the 27–29 age group and the 30–34 age group, but dropped sharply for women over 35. The age of the male partner had a significant impact on female fertility among the women who had reached their mid-30s, but not among the younger women. However, experts said the new study was too small and there were too many variables which were too difficult to sort out, for a clear conclusion to be drawn. Some experts suggested that the main change in fertility in the older women was the fact that it took them "longer" to conceive, not necessary that they were significantly more unlikely to eventually succeed. David Dunson, a biostatistician at the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, said that: "Although we noted a decline in female fertility in the late 20s, what we found was a decrease in the probability of becoming pregnant per menstrual cycle, not in the probability of eventually achieving a pregnancy."
A French study found no difference between the fertility rate of women under 25 and those ages 26–30, after which fertility started to decrease. Estimating the "fertility of a woman" is quite difficult because of the male factor (quality of sperm). This French study looked at 2,193 women who were using artificial insemination because their husbands were azoospermic. The cumulative success rates after 12 cycles of insemination were 73% for women under age 25, 74% in women ages 26–30, 61% for ages 31–35, and 54% in the over 35 age group. (Note that the study is from 1982; artificial insemination techniques and success rates have evolved greatly since then.)
In Hungary, a study by the Központi Statisztikai Hivatal (Central Statistics Office) estimated that 7%–12% of Hungarian women younger than 30 were infertile; 13%–22% of women age 35 were infertile; and 24%–46% of women age 40 were infertile.
The below is a table containing estimates of the percentage of women who, if starting to conceive at a certain age, will fail to obtain a live birth. Note that while for the young ages researchers tend to agree, for older ages there is discrepancy.
As observed in the table above, there isn't much agreement about the ability of women in their forties to have a live birth.
Ovarian reserve.
In terms of ovarian reserve, a typical woman has 12% of her reserve at age 30 and has only 3% at age 40. 81% of variation in ovarian reserve is due to age alone, making age the most important factor in female infertility.
The most common methods of checking the status of the ovarian reserve is to perform a blood test on day 3 of the menstrual cycle to measure serum FSH level, alternatively a blood test to measure the serum AMH level can give similar information. Transvaginal ultrasound can also be used to “count the number of follicles” and this procedure is called Antral Follicle Count.
Historical data.
A study of a population of French women from 1670 and 1789 shows that those who married at age 20–24 had 7.0 children on average and 3.7% remained childless. Women who married at age 25–29 years had a mean of 5.7 children and 5.0% remained childless. Women who married at 30–34 years had a mean of 4.0 children and 8.2% remained childless.
In 1957, a study was done on a large population that never used birth control. The investigators measured the relationship between the age of the female partner and fertility. (Infertility rates today are believed to be higher in the general population than for the population in this study from the 1950s.)
This 1957 study found that:
Impact.
Family planning.
The inverse correlation between age and female fertility in later reproductive life is argued to motivate family planning well before having reached 35 years of age. Mapping of a woman's ovarian reserve, follicular dynamics and associated biomarkers can give an individual prognosis about future chances of pregnancy, facilitating an informed choice of when to have children.
Reproductive medicine.
Most in vitro fertilization (IVF) centers will attempt IVF using the female partner's "own eggs" until about age 43–45. Michael Fox, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist in Jacksonville, Florida states that, in regard to assisted reproduction treatment, "in general our approach to treatment of patients over age 35 is vastly more aggressive than in younger patients."
Elite egg donor agencies that advertise in places such as Ivy League student newspapers offering up to $20,000 or even $50,000 for donor eggs seek donors under the age of 29.
The issues of age need to be taken up with a qualified fertility specialist such as a reproductive endocrinologist.
A review in 2012 came to the result that therapeutic interventions to halt or reverse the process of reproductive ageing in women is limited, despite recent reports of the potential existence of stem cells which may be used to restore the ovarian reserve. a non-profit patient advocacy organization, states that both three out of four men and three out of four women overestimate by five years the age of the onset of the rapid decline which is at 35 instead of 40 as most people commonly believe. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) states, "...women in their 20's to early 30's are most likely to conceive."

The Abbey School, Faversham

The Abbey School is a non-selective secondary school in the town of Faversham in Kent, United Kingdom. Founded with the amalgamation of Ethelbert Road Boys School and Lady Capel School for Girls in 1983, the school consists of 953 pupils from the ages of 11-19.
In 2004 the school became widely known as the first comprehensive school to introduce random drug testing and the scheme operated until 2008. The School was promoted to academy status in 2011.
History.
The School was opened in September 1983 with the amalgamation of Ethelbert Road Boys School and Lady Capel School for Girls. The Boys school was decommissioned with students moving to the south side of Faversham where the school currently stands. In 1987, Peter Walker became the school's 1st headteacher.
In February 2000, Walker reported to Ofsted about the deteriorating conditions of the former canteen that was built in the 1940s. The roof had become a thick layer of moss with asbestos that caused paint to peel of the walls.
In September 2004, with the support of parents, the school became the first to introduce random drug tests which commenced in January 2005. The tests could be performed only when parents gave permission for their child to be tested. Students who refused to be available for testing or tested positive would undergo a counselling program. Critics of the program stated an infringement of privacy would lead to legal action. At the school, 20 students were tested weekly and were given a mouth swab for cannabis, cocaine and heroin. Supporters of the program including former Prime Minister Tony Blair who endorsed Walker's efforts and called for the program to be expanded. In 2005, the school reported that the scheme helped to boost examination results to 40% compared with 32% in 2004, and 28% in 2003.
In 2006, headteacher Peter Walker retired from his position to become Britain's official ambassador for drug testing and gave a presentation to John Walters, the director of the White House drug policy office. His position was taken over by Jenny James who promised to continue drug testing. The scheme was ended in 2008, due to other schools not performing the tests. Within the space of four years, only one student tested positive.
James was succeded by Catrin Woodend after some months and oversaw the school's transition to an academy in 2011. Woodend also organised the building of the school's all-weather pitch which was completed in 2012.
Goverance.
The Governors are responsible for the school on behalf of the Members of the Academy Trust.
The school has 6 Community Governors, 2 Parent Governors and 2 staff Governors.
School structure.
Lower school.
As of 2014, the lower school has an annual intake of 210 students at the beginning of Year Seven (age 11). The lower school (Years 7-11) is 865 students strong, for whom the school uniform for boys consists of a black jacket accompanied with the school badge on the breast pocket, with black trousers and a white shirt. Socks must be black, shoes must also be black and plain and shirts must be worn with a tie. The uniform for girls consists of a fitted black jacket accompanied with the school badge on the breast pocket, with black trousers and a white blouse with no tie.
Sixth form.
In keeping with line with the school's ethos of Business and Enterprise, students have the expectation to dress in clothing suitable for the school's ethos.
The school maintains an Football Academy in Association with Dover Athletic F.C. and is currently run by coach Michael Sandmann. In 2012, two academy players Tom Axford and Lloyd Harrington, were selected for the England Schoolboy Internationals for the spring and the matches were broadcast live on Sky Sports.
Curriculum.
As of 2010, the school follows the National Curriculum in Years 7–11 and offers a broad range of GCSEs (national exams taken by students aged 14–16) and A-levels (national exams taken by pupils aged 16–18). The school has no affiliation with a particular religious denomination, but religious education is given throughout the school.
Students in Key Stage 3 are taught within the national curriculum with timetables arranged to allow students to work at the level of their ability. Students with learning disabilities receive additional support such as teaching in small groups, help from Learning Support Assistants or computer packages which aim to improve literacy and numeracy skills. Students in Key Stage 4 continue to study within the national curriculum but they are able to select a range of additional subjects they wish to study.
The school year runs from September to July, split across three terms: the autumn term (September to December), spring term (January to April) and the summer term (April to July). Students receive two weeks off for Christmas and Easter, a six-week summer break, and three "half term" breaks.
Examination.
League tables published by the The Daily Telegraph based on 2013 A-level results rank Abbey as the 34th best school in Kent. According to the Department of Education, in 2013 A-level students achieved an average of 520.9 QCDA points, against a national average of 796.6 and 51 percent of students achieved five or more grade C results (or equivalent) at GCSE, including Maths and English.
Extra-curricular activities.
The school has many clubs that use the Sport Centre of the school:-
Property.
The school runs a restaurant called 14-19 which opened in 2005 with food prepared, cooked and served by Vocational students who are studying Level 2 BTEC Hospitality and Catering. The majority of the food is locally sourced from Faversham and surrounding villages. Alongside the restaurant, there is an horticulture area and business units.
In 2012, a third generation all-weather football pitch was constructed on the grounds of the school. The pitch had been started by fundraising in 2009 with the final funding coming from the Kent FA with a grant of £390,000 and funds from charities Bensted and Queenborough Fisheries Trust. The construction work was carried out by Charles Lawrence Surfaces in conjunction with Surfacing Standards and Lano Sports, a Football Foundation Framework Partners at a cost of £650,000. The official opening ceremony was held on 19 July 2012 and was attended by Hugh Robertson along with headteacher Catrin Woodend. The 3G pitch surface is estimated to be used for a total of 90 hours with 2,200 players using it weekly.
The school created an all-purpose sports hall which would include improvements to the changing rooms and community gymansium 'The Abbey Sports Centre' with a viewing gallery that would overlook the outdoor pitches. The plans secured backing of Faversham Town Council on 17 December 2012. 
In 2013, the school was awarded £1.2million for a makeover to provide a new modern look and an energy efficient environment.
The Abbey runs a nursery called Twinkle Toes Nursery, which opened in 2009 and operates from a purpose built building on the site. The nursery employs 15 staff with two managers and a cook. The nursery is also suject to Ofsted inspections with the last held on 4 January 2011, stating the nursery is "well led and managed" with the inspection noting that the environment was "thoughfully set out" along with parent relations as "very positive".
The school runs a dining hall and business centre that is located near the Autism Integration Unit and the dining hall is used for wedding receptions, dancing, charity fund-raising events and the annual Year 11 Prom. Usage for the Business room which includes Businesses, Adult Education, use as a conference room, training venue and ICT training. An Outdoor Performance Area (OPA) is maintained with a capacity of 70 people and is used for outdoor performances relating to productions mainly held during the summer. Previous uses of the OPA have included karaoke competitions and events in the style of the musical talent show The X Factor.

2012 Vintage Yachting Games – O-Jolle

The O-Jolle was an event on the 2012 Vintage Yachting Games program at Lake Como, Italy. Five out of the nine scheduled race were completed. 11 sailors, on 20 boats, from 3 nations entered.
Venue overview.
Race area and Course.
Of the three Campo's (Race Area's) available for the 2012 Vintage Yachting Games at Lake Como Campo Bravo was used for the O-Jolle event. In general this Campo is situated in front of the city of Dervio.
For the 2012 edition of the Vintage Yachting Games three different courses were available. The O-Jolle could only use course 3.
Wind conditions.
The Northern part of Lake Como was reportedly a thermic wind venue. In this time of year the normal situation is that at about 13:00 the Swiss mountains are heated up and a Southern wind hits the racing areas with about 10 to 14 knots. As result of this no races were scheduled in the morning. Unfortunately during the event the temperature in Switzerland was low during the Vintage. Also was the thermal South breeze battling with the gradient wind from the North. As result the actual wind did not came above the 8 knots during the races and was instable at times.
Campo Bravo has normally a tendency to have a slightly higher wind speed than the two other Campo's this due to the fact that it is more Northern than Charlie so that the Southern thermal breeze is strengthened and that the fact that the lake narrows in front of Dervio.

Races.
Summary.
In the O-Jolle, Olympic in 1936, at Campo Bravo only five races could be complet. The Dutch sailors took the first three places. Ton OP DE WEEGH once again was victorious at Lake Como. He became European Champion here two years ago and showed once again that this is his lake! Silver was for Martin BAAS and the bronze for Thies BOSCH in his new boat.

Alexander Robert Badcock

General Sir Alexander Robert Badcock, KCB, CSI (1844–1907) was a general in the British Indian Army.
Life.
He was educated at Harrow School, the son of Henry Badcock (1801–1888), a Taunton banker. His grandfather, Isaac Badcock and his great-uncle, John Badcock had founded "Badcock's Bank" at Taunton in 1800, which later became known as "Stuckey's Bank" and then the Westminster Bank.
He obtained his first commission as ensign on 1 Oct. 1861, was promoted lieutenant on 1 Oct. 1862 and captain on 1 Oct. 1873, brevet-colonel on 2 March 1885, major-general on 1 April 1897, lieutenant-general on 3 April 1900.
After a brief period of regimental duty with the 38th foot and then with the 29th Bengal native infantry, he entered in 1864 the commissariat department, in which he remained till 1895, achieving a remarkable success and rising to the highest post of commissary general-in-chief, December 1890. 
In his three earliest campaigns, Bhutan War (1864-5), the Black Mountain Expedition (1868), and Perak (1875-6) he attracted notice for his foresight and power of organisation, winning the thanks of government. 
His next service was rendered as principal commissariat officer under Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts in the Kuram field force (1878-9), taking part in the forcing of the Peiwar Kotal and other actions. 
Returning from furlough when operations were resumed, he joined the Kabul field force, and owing to his admirable preparations Lord Roberts found in Sherpur when it was invested 'supplies for men stored for nearly four months and for animals for six weeks.'
Badcock also assisted in recovering the guns abandoned near Bhagwana, and finally when the Kabul-Kandahar field force, consisting of 9986 men and eighteen guns with 8000 followers and 2300 horses and mules, started on 9 Aug. 1880 he relieved Roberts's 'greatest anxiety,' and the force reached Kandahar, 313 miles from Kabul, on 31 Aug., with a safe margin of supplies. 
For these services he received the medal and three clasps, the bronze star, brevets of major and lieutenant-colonel, and the C.B. Roberts reported to government that he knew of 'no officer so well qualified as Major Badcock to be placed at the head of the commissariat in the field.' 
In 1885, he collected transport for the Sudan, and in 1895 received the C.S.I, and the thanks of government for his services in connection with the Chitral relief force. He was appointed quartermaster-general in India on 7 Nov. 1895. Besides these appointments he acted as secretary in the military department 1890-1 and was president of a committee to consider the grant of compensation for dearness of provisions, October 1894. 
On his retirement at the expiration of his term of office as quartermaster-general in 1900, he took an active part in the organisation of the imperial yeomanry, and was appointed member of the council of India, receiving on 26 June 1902 the K.C.B. He died in London on 23 March 1907, while still holding that office, and was buried at Taunton.
There is no known familial relationship between General Sir Alexander Robert Badcock and another nineteenth century British Army general bearing the same surname, General Sir Lovell Benjamin Badcock.
Family.
He married in 1865, Theophila Lowther, daughter of John Shore Dumergue, I.C.S., judge of Aligarh, by whom he had four sons and a daughter. All his sons entered the army. Sir Alexander appears in the picture of officers who took part in the Kabul - Kandahar march published by Major Whitelock of Birmingham in 1911.

<doc id="36579012" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36579012" title="Passenger Environment Survey">
Passenger Environment Survey

Passenger Environment Survey (PES) is a quality-control type survey used by a number of transit agencies to rate and monitor performance. Generally a PES would include items such as cleanliness, litter, appearance, temperature (heating and air conditioning), graffiti, trash cans, and other quality issues affecting customer perception and quality of the riding experience. There is usually a quality control criteria, and dedicated surveyors are used to gather data that summarize into periodic ratings.
In North America, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), Bay Area Rapid Transit District, and Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority are three agencies currently using this type of surveys. However, many other transit agencies have similar surveys or quality assurance processes—but other names might be used to describe them.
Introduction.
Quantitative measurements require clear and well-defined standards. The majority of PES
standards were developed from the same quality control criteria used by operating departments
to manage their employees. Quality control criteria are found in various agency documents.
Some are codified in rules and regulations, union contracts, standard operating procedures, and
other official documents; others appear in training materials, field manuals, and management
procedures distributed to field staff.
Use of actual operating standards is important: it lends PES a degree of official credibility, and
improves acceptance by management and the public alike. Use of a different criteria to
monitor performance would be unfair to both employees and management. Additionally, use of
operating standards ensures by default all field employees would be familiar with PES indicators,
and thus clearly understand the yardstick by which their performance is measured.
Data Collection.
Because of PES's audit and merit assessment functions, the operator must ensure data collection
forces have no vested interest in survey results. Biases associated with using operating staff for
data collection have been observed in many organizations. Difference between traffic checker
ridership counts, conductor reported passenger counts, and ridership levels implied by fare
receipts often differ in commuter railroads and other transit organizations. To provide a neutral
data collection workforce, a cadre (group) of specially trained surveyors can be used. Surveyors
report directly to a performance measurement unit in central administration, minimizing the
influence of operating departments.
Surveyors should be hired directly from outside through the usual HR process. Therefore, they start at the operating agency
with minimal pre-conceptions about operations. These procedures together ensure that PES truly
represents the perspective of customers – seeing the system as they see it.
Important Features.
Several features are particularly important in this type of quality control survey:
1. Quantitative Measurements are Taken Whenever Possible: Surveyors are required to
count or measure quantities. Number of doors not operating is counted. Interior
temperature is measured with a digital thermometer. Quantitative data enables analysis
to be conducted after the fact, and reduce the risk of surveyor errors in judgment.
2. Auditing Information is Gathered Simultaneously: By collecting information such as
car numbers, boarding and alighting stations and times, an analyst can later establish
whether the surveyor was actually present at the correct location. The fleet numbers can
be cross-checked with block register information independently recorded by operations
personnel in signal towers. This is particularly critical when invariably a bad score
causes operating departments to challenge the validity of one surveyor's work. If
discrepancies are found, results are discarded and surveyor asked to explain how
mismatching car numbers appeared in their data. Additionally, spotchecks by surveyor
supervision helps to maintain data quality.
3. Failing Scores are Clearly Documented: Whenever a failing score is recorded, the
surveyor records the reason on the form. This demonstrates the surveyor understands
PES standards and their correct application. The data is also used to analyze root causes
of failing scores. The requirement to record specifics (e.g. color of observed graffiti)
allows for post-facto auditing of surveyor activity. Analysts regularly review the forms
to gauge surveyors' comprehension level and act proactively to prevent recurring errors,
by reinstructing surveyors as necessary.
4. Qualitative Measures Require Clearly Defined Rating Standards: Occasionally,
quantitative measure is difficult or impossible to collect. An ordinal 'rating' standard is
then used with clear definitions. Bottles and cans,
and food matters trigger an automatic failure rating.
Sampling for PESs.
Statistically valid measurements require even and representative samples. Biases due to
sampling must be minimized, to ensure validity in PES's audit and merit assessment functions.
At the same time, sample size must be minimized for cost reasons. Striking a balance between a
statistically valid sample and minimum surveyor cost is not simple. Historical data analyses
suggest PES scores are correlated with time-of-day, location, and service route, even though
indicators themselves are independent. PES scores are also subject to clustering effects: data
collected sequentially on the same day may be adversely affected by common factors such as a
school condition, weather conditions, or special events. A pure random sample is an inefficient
method of collecting such data, but observations made sequentially cannot be treated as
independent observations.
Generally, a good statistical sample should fulfill three criteria:
1. Sample error margins should be appropriate for the intended use of the statistic.
2. Sample should be representative of the underlying population.
3. Data collection method should not violate assumptions (e.g. assumption of independent observation) used when designing the sample.
A representative sample weighs each sub-class of the population equally. Applying that
principle to PES requires analysts to determine a priori what factors might affect PES scores,
and stratify the sample based on buckets of these variables. However, PES scores are affected by
many factors. With few observations per reporting period and many scheduling constraints,
a true stratified sample is not possible. A heuristic (rule-of-thumb) can be used to minimize the
impacts of skews introduced by uneven sampling:
Application in New York.
Passenger Environment Survey at the NYCTA was introduced by David L. Gunn, former president of the Authority.
PES was introduced in the First Quarter of 1983 and consisted of a handful of very simple
indicators designed to quantify how amenable and comfortable the transit environment was to
our customers. Although it is difficult to objectively assess the many conditions that relate to
passengers’ feelings and perceptions, the early indicators provided a systematic framework to
assess performance in these areas independently of anecdotal customer comments. In that sense
the early PES was a big step forward and an important recognition that NYCT cares deeply about
the environment that is presented everyday to our 7.3 million customers. The early PES
included 11 subway indicators, and 21 bus indicators.
Several indicators were added in 1995, expanding the scope of PES. Indicators relating to the station environment such as functioning turnstiles and escalator/elevators were added. A major revision occurred in 2000, when indicators specifically designed to measure the performance of cleaning crews were added. Quarterly reports were scaled back to semi-annual beginning in 2004. NYCT began monitoring the passenger environment aboard express buses in 2007. Additionally, the PES survey methodologies have been used on a variety of "pilot" policy initiatives designed to measure the impact of allocating additional production resources to cleaning functions. The PES approach has been such a success that NYCT regularly receives requests for details, nationally and internationally, from other transit properties wishing to model quality control programs after NYCT's PES.
Initially, PES data was tabulated manually, and reports were issued quarterly with substantial time lag. Although this enabled managers to act after the fact to improve performance, many months may pass before substantial performance improvement is achieved. With the advent of personal computers, NYCT began keeping PES data and reporting results using spreadsheet applications and databases. Internal reports are now issued much more frequently, allowing management to react to mediocre scores mid-quarter. Data mining capabilities allow special requests from top management to be handled quantitatively.
Today, NYCT routinely produces internal PES monthly reports as a snapshot to assist operating personnel in taking corrective actions. The PES database is being migrated to Transit's enterprise server. The data collection effort is being transitioned from pen and paper to handheld computers. The PES staff provides regular 'Roadshows' in field locations to improve operations managers’ understanding of PES ratings and how they might improve PES scores, thereby improving the customer experience. These PES Roadshows have become an important mechanism of information exchange, improving relationships between PES and operating staff, and allows PES staff to gain valuable understanding of operations processes.
New York City Transit's Passenger Environment Survey (PES) is a quantitative and scientific approach to measuring passenger perception of NYCT's services. The PES standards are consistent, well-defined, and clearly understood by operations personnel. The indicators are measured from a passenger perspective by a group of dedicated and impartial surveyors, and
subject to rigorous data quality control by trained statistical analysts. Internally, PES functions as a performance audit for field operations management. Externally, PES serves as a dispassionate and analytical 'scorecard' measure of passenger experience.
First designed in 1983, PES has evolved over time to include 68 indicators in four distinct categories measured in four different passenger environments. Nine survey forms and 25 surveyors produce semi-annual reports with statistical precision exceeding 95% ± 5%. NYCT has such confidence in these measures that PES results are considered in the promotion and merit
decision-making process. The rich and extensive dataset generated by these periodic sample measurements are used throughout NYCT to support quantitative management decision making.

The Kuwait Water Towers are a prominent group of 31 water towers in Kuwait City, completed in 1976. 
Design and construction.
In 1965, the government of Kuwait commissioned the Swedish engineering company of VBB (since 1997 "Sweco") to develop and implement a plan for a modern water-supply system for Kuwait City. The company built five groups of altogether thirty-one water towers, designed by its chief architect Sune Lindström, called "the mushroom towers". They were built by VBB out of standard reinforced concrete and of prestressed concrete. Each tower holds 3,000 cubic meters of water. The tower groups are distinguished by number, height, color and ornamentation and they serve as landmarks for their districts. 
For a sixth site, the Amir of Kuwait, Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed, wanted a more spectacular design. This last group, known as Kuwait Towers, consists of three towers, two of which also serve as water towers.
These thirty-three towers have together a standard capacity of 102,000 cubic meters of water. "The Water Towers" (The Kuwait Tower and the Kuwait Water Towers) were awarded the Aga Khan Award for Architecture (1980 Cycle).

Norwegian football clubs in European football

Norwegian football teams have entered Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) club competitions every season since 1960. Nineteen clubs have represented Norway in four official tournaments: Champions League (originally the European Cup), Europa League (originally the UEFA Cup), the Cup Winners' Cup and the Intertoto Cup, the latter two which are now defunct. Rosenborg has participated in 30 seasons, more than any other Norwegian team, while Fyllingen, Gjøvik-Lyn, Haugar and Kongsvinger have only participated once each. No Norwegian teams have ever advanced past the quarter-finals of any tournament, with Rosenborg, Lyn, Brann and Vålerenga having reached one quarter-final each.
Fredrikstad made Norway's debut by winning over Ajax in the 1960–61 European Cup. They would represent Norway for the first three seasons until Lyn took the place in 1963–64. The same year Gjøvik-Lyn debuted for Norway in the Cup Winners' Cup. Rosenborg made Norway's debut in the UEFA Cup in 1971. In 93 entries between 1960 and 1992, Norwegian clubs only succeeded at advancing past the first fixture sixteen times, and only once past the second, when Lyn reached the 1968–69 European Cup Winners' Cup quarter-finals. From 1993 Norwegian clubs started advancing past the first rounds more regularly. Rosenborg reached the group state of the 1995–96 UEFA Champions League and would qualify for that level eight consecutive times and eleven in total. The following season Rosenborg reached the quarter-finals, the same season as Brann reached the quarter-finals of the Cup Winners' Cup. Vålerenga would match the feat in the 1998–99 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. The following year Molde qualified to bring two teams to the group state of the 1999–2000 UEFA Champions League. The 2005–06 season saw Rosenborg play in the Champions League group stage and both Viking and Tromsø play in the UEFA Cup group state. Rosenborg is the only team qualify for the UEFA Cup by winning all its matches in the Intertoto Cup, an achievement they completed in 2008.
Werder Bremen has eliminated Norwegian teams a record all of the five attempts. Linfield has played Norwegian teams a record seven times, with the team being eliminated a record five times. Viking holds a Norwegian record 18–0 victory Principat from 1999, while Leeds United served a Norwegian record 0–16 defeat for Lyn in 1969.

Glitters Like Gold

'Glitters Like Gold' arrived in July 2012 as the third release and second official single taken from the fifth studio album by British indie rock band The Cribs. 'Glitters Like Gold' featured throughout the February and March 2012 tour at venues in London, Edinburgh, Brighton and Leeds, and opens fifth LP "In the Belly of the Brazen Bull". Recorded and mixed at Tarbox Road Studios, Cassadaga with producer David Fridmann, the song received mastering treatment in Sterling Sound, New York City from Greg Calbi.
Physical release.
Unlike other Cribs releases, the single came in a transparent sleeve with minimal artwork. However, the transparent vinyl features gold glitter sprinkled throughout, and received the catalogue number 'WEBB338S'.
'On a Hotel Wall'.
'On a Hotel Wall', the 7" vinyl b-side, features a different set-up for the band. Gary plays guitar whereas Ryan takes up bass duties, and although recorded during the album sessions with Fridmann, did not make the final cut. The band originally intended to hold this song back for a future album, but changed their mind at the last minute. The song reached completion though Chris Potter at Electric Mastering, London.
Miscellaneous.
The band released an accompanying video for the song by working with directors Andy Knowles and Stephen Agnew. Based on the 'Pop-Up Videos' of the 90s, the promo features an interactive element coupled with several 'facts' about the band members, often of a humorous nature. The video received a premiere on influential contemporary music website Pitchfork.

Ahmed Hilmi Pasha

Ahmed Hilmi Abd al-Baqi (1883 in Sidon - 1963), was a soldier, economist, and politician, who served in various post-Ottoman Empire governments, and was Prime Minister of the short-lived All-Palestine Government in the Gaza Strip.
Early life.
Before the collapse of the Ottoman Empire Hilmi attained the rank of General in the Ottoman army. In 1920 he was Minister of Finance for the short-lived Arab Kingdom of Syria in Damascus. He subsequently became the finance minister in Transjordan.
In Mandatory Palestine.
In 1925, he became the Director General of Awqaf in Mandatory Palestine, the organisation headed by Haj Amin Husseini, which controlled and regulated properties bequeathed to charities under Islamic Law. He later began his banking career when he joined the Arab Bank, which had been established in Jerusalem by Abdul Hamid Shoman in 1930. A few years later Ahmed Hilmi founded his own bank, the Arab National Bank. He was one of the early members of the Istiqlal (Independence) Party which was set up in 1932 and in April 1936 he was named as a member of the Arab Higher Committee becoming its treasurer.
In 1937 he, along with other members of the Higher Committee not already in exile, was deported to the Seychelles Islands. In 1939 he was allowed to attend the London Conference at St. James Palace, where he urged the Higher Committee to accept the British proposals later set out in the 1939 White paper. Regarded by the authorities as a moderate, he was allowed back to Palestine in the early 1940s and resumed his post as chairman of the National Bank. He purchased the newspaper Filistin and used it to present Istiqlal policies to the public. The war years were very profitable for the Palestinian economy and the bank had large deposits to invest. In August 1943 he set up the Arab National Fund the purpose of which was to buy land from farmers who were heavily in dept and to encourage the establishment of Awqaf whose proceeds would be allocated to the Fund. By the middle of 1946 the Fund had an income of £P150,000 and owned 15,000 dunams (3,750 acres) of land. It had offices in all the Arab towns and in most of the large villages. Since the Supreme Muslim Council had been abolished the Fund was the only institution offering an alternative to land purchases by the Jewish National Fund. Its success was seen as a threat by followers of the Haj Amin Husseini, who had formed the Palestine Arab Party with most of its leaders in exile. With the end of the war the fund went into decline.
As the situation in Palestine deteriorated, the Arab League tried to impose a united front on the various Palestinian Arab factions. Eventually in January 1947, after four attempts, a five-member Higher Arab Committee was set up, which included Hilmi. Husayin al-Khalidi and Hilmi were the only members of this Committee actually resident in Palestine during 1947 and 1948.
Prime Minister of All-Palestine Government.
On 9 July 1948, following the declaration of Israeli statehood, the Arab League set up the Administrative Council for Palestine, chaired by Hilmi. On 22 September the National Assembly was set up in Gaza, with Haj Amin Husseini as President and Hilmi as Prime Minister. The assembly ceased to function following the Israeli army victories in Southern Palestine and the Arab Legion assuming control over Bethlehem and Hebron. In 1949 Hilmi became a district military governor in the West Bank and later he served as the Palestinian representative to the Arab League.

The track's turns are banked differently; the first is banked at 14°, the second turn at 8° and the final turn with 6°. However, each of the three straightaways are banked at 2°. Brad Keselowski was the defending race winner.
Before the race, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. led the Drivers' Championship with 731 points, and Matt Kenseth stood in second with 717. Greg Biffle was third in the Drivers' Championship with 709 points, five ahead of Jimmie Johnson and 42 ahead of Denny Hamlin in fourth and fifth. Kevin Harvick with 653 was even with Martin Truex, Jr., as Tony Stewart with 652 points, was three ahead of Brad Keselowski, and nine in front of Clint Bowyer. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet was leading with144 points, 28 ahead of Toyota. Ford, with 97 points, was fourteen points ahead of Dodge in the battle for third.
Practice and qualifying.
Two practice sessions were held before the race on August 3, 2012. The first and second session were each 90 minutes long. Johnson was quickest with a time of 51.638 seconds in the first session, 0.088 faster than Kyle Busch. Carl Edwards was third quickest, followed by Kenseth, Biffle, and Kasey Kahne. Joey Logano was seventh, still within a three-tenths of a second of Johnson's time. Shortly before the first session concluded, Paul Menard sustained major damages to his car after crashing, causing the team to use their replacement car. In the second and final practice session, Earnhardt, Jr. was quickest with a time of 50.721 seconds. Kenseth with a time of 50.855, was second quickest, ahead of Biffle, Kyle Busch, and Edwards. Jamie McMurray, Truex, Jr., Jeff Gordon, Kurt Busch, and Johnson completed the first ten positions.
Forty-four cars were entered for qualifying, but only forty-three could qualify for the race because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Juan Pablo Montoya clinched his eighth pole position of his career, with a time of 51.124 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Hamlin. Menard qualified third, Kahne took fourth, and Marcos Ambrose started fifth. Kurt Busch, Kenseth, Earnhardt, Jr., Ryan Newman and Johnson rounded out the top ten. The driver that failed to qualify for the race was Stephen Leicht.
Once the qualifying session had concluded, Montoya stated, "I know (Sunday) is going to be a reality check that we've still got to work on it a lot. But the race hasn't even started, and we haven't seen how the car works in clean air. We know there's a lot of really strong cars, but you make the right strategy and if you get track position, we've shown we've got the speed. I'm really open-minded. I told people, 'Let's enjoy today.' "
Race.
The race started started 90 minutes late due to a rain delay. The first ten laps of the race featured two lead changes and four others as Denny Hamlin and pole-sitter Juan Pablo Montoya repassed each other four times in two laps. Dale Earnhardt, Jr. was also in contention for the lead before his transmission broke, and Jimmie Johnson led the most laps, but would crash on a restart with Matt Kenseth and Hamlin in Turn 1 on Lap 91. Jeff Gordon, who was running fifth on the restart avoided the crash, and would become the new leader. Seven laps later under caution, the thunderstorm hit the track and after 98 of the scheduled 160 laps, giving Gordon his 86th career Sprint Cup win. Kasey Kahne came in second, and his contentions in the race were dashed in pit road during the final caution, when he ran over an air hose and had a flat right-rear tire.
Lightning strikes.
After the race, a spectator was killed by a lightning strike, while nine others (one critical) were injured. The nine injured spectators were taken to area hospitals, and five of them were later taken to local hospitals for examination. The track had tweeted for fans to "seek shelter as severe lightning and heavy winds are in our area", and the fans were instructed by public address systems at the track to take cover. However, fans posted on the track's Facebook page that they could not hear the warnings, and a fan tweeted to the Associated Press that the noise levels at races are so loud that little could hear the public address system. The race wasn't called until 42 minutes after the warning, leading to questions over whether or not NASCAR should have ended the race earlier. Race winner Jeff Gordon stated that he had heard a crack while he was on pit road.
The victim, 41-year old Brian Zimmerman from Moosic, Pennsylvania, was standing next to his car at the track's parking lot behind the Turn 3 grandstand. Bystanders had attempted to perform CPR on him until paramedics arrived. Zimmerman was later taken to the track's medical facility, and was pronounced dead at a local hospital at 6:11 pm. The victim that was in critical condition after getting struck was later in stable condition on August 6.
The American flag at the track was flown at half-mast the morning after the race. Pocono Raceway later established the "Pennsylvania 400 Memorial Fund" to help benefit the victims of the strikes.

May Day (Matt Pryor album)

May Day is the second solo album released by The Get Up Kids lead singer Matt Pryor. Released in early 2012, the album was funded entirely through the crowdfunding website Kickstarter.
Recording.
In early 2011, after a world tour with The Get Up Kids supporting their album There Are Rules, lead singer Matt Pryor decided to write and record a second solo album to follow up 2008's Confidence Man. Since the release of his first record, Pryor's longstanding relationship with Vagrant Records had come to an end, and he decided to release the album independently.
On May 2, 2011 Pryor launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the production and release of the album, entitled "May Day." Pryor wrote and recorded the album on his own in his home studio concurrently with the month-long campaign. Much like the last Get Up Kids album, "May Day" was recorded entirely on analog equipment. The funding campaign launched with a goal of raising $10,000 to fund the entire release of the album, but ended up raising more than double that by the end of the campaign.
Release.
"May Day" was released first to Kickstarter backers in late 2011, and released wide on January 24, 2012. The album was released on compact disc, 12-inch vinyl and digital download.

Buffalo Traditional School

Buffalo Traditional High School is a former magnet school in Buffalo, New York. It served Grades 5 through 12 and was located at 450 Masten Avenue in the city's East Side. It closed in 2005.
History.
The building was constructed in 1964 on the site that formerly served as home to the Buffalo Bisons minor-league baseball team. It first served as the home as Woodlawn Junior High School and became a symbol of the Civil Rights and integration battles of Buffalo, due to failed efforts by African-American residents to have the school integrated with white students. Buffalo Traditional was created in 1977 as part of Buffalo's desegregation program.
In 2005, the school was closed. The remaining students were transferred to either Emerson/Harvey Austin Middle School or East High School. The building currently serves home to the Buffalo Academy for Visual and Performing Arts.

Global apartheid

Global apartheid is a term used to mean minority rule in international decision-making. The term comes from apartheid, the system of governmental that ruled South Africa until 27 April 1994 when people of all races were able to vote as equals for the first time.
The concept of global apartheid has been developed by many researchers, including Titus Alexander, Bruno Amoroso, Patrick Bond, Gernot Kohler, Arjun Makhijiani, Ali Mazuri, Vandana Shiva, Anthony Richmond, Joseph Nevins, Muhammed Asadi, Gustav Fridolin, and many others.
Origin and use.
The first use of the term may have been by Gernot Koehler in a 1978 Working Paper for the World Order Models Project. In 1995 Koehler develop this in "The Three Meanings of Global Apartheid: Empirical, Normative, Existential".
Its best known use by a prominent politician was by Thabo Mbeki, then-President of South Africa, in a 2002 speech, drawing comparisons the status of the world's people, economy, and access to natural resources to the apartheid era. Mbeki got the term from Titus Alexander, initiator of Charter 99, a campaign for global democracy, who was also present at the UN Millennium Summit and gave him a copy of "Unravelling Global Apartheid".
Concept.
Minority rule in global governance is based on national sovereignty rather than racial identity, but in many other respects the history and structures of apartheid South Africa can be seen as a microcosm of the world. Following the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Second World War, the United States and United Kingdom used their political power to create systems of economic management and protection to mitigate the worst effects of free trade and neutralise the competing appeals of communism and national socialism. In South Africa "civilized labour" policies restricted public employment to whites, reserved skilled jobs for whites and controlled the movement of non-whites through a system of pass laws. In the West, escalating tariff barriers reserved manufacturing work for Europeans and Americans while immigration laws controlled the movement of non-white people seeking work, introducing a system of passports and visas more draconian than apartheid pass laws. Both the West and South Africa used taxes and other economic instruments to manage demand, create public services and build armed forces to protect minority rule.
At a political level, the West still dominates global decision-making through minority control of the central banking system (Bank of International Settlements), IMF, World Bank, Security Council and other institutions of global governance. The G8 represent less than 15 per cent of world population, yet have over 60 per cent of its income. Eighty per cent of the permanent members of the UN Security Council represent white Western states, 60% from Europe. The West has veto power in the World Bank, IMF and WTO and regulates global monetary policy through the Bank of International Settlements (BIS). By tradition, the head of the World Bank is always a US citizen, nominated by the US President, and the IMF is a European. Although the rest of the world now has a majority in many international institutions, it does not have the political power to reject decisions by the Western minority.
In "The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order", Samuel P. Huntington describes how "the United States together with Britain and France make the crucial decisions on political and security issues; the United States together with Germany and Japan make the crucial decisions on economic issues." Huntington quotes Jeffrey R Bennett to point out that Western nations:
Huntington presents a ‘framework, a paradigm, for viewing global politics’ to protect “Western civilization”. He argues that other civilizations threaten the West through immigration, cultural differences, growing economic strength and potential military power. ‘If North America and Europe renew their moral life, build on their cultural commonality, and develop close forms of economic and political integration to supplement their security collaboration in NATO, they could generate a third Euroamerican phase of Western affluence and political influence. Meaningful political integration would in some measure counter the relative decline in the West’s share of the world’s people, economic product, and military capabilities and revive the power of the West in the eyes of the leaders of other civilizations.’ However, this ‘depends overwhelmingly on whether the United States reaffirms its identity as a Western nation and defines its global role as the leader of Western civilization.’ 
In many respects, minority rule in global governance is worse than apartheid South Africa. Inequality in income and influence between people in the Majority World of Africa, Asia and Latin America and the Western minority is greater than between black and white in South Africa under apartheid. Although the West condemns racism and includes people of African descent at the highest levels of governance (e.g. former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and President Obama), the structures of global decision-making systematically prevent the world’s majority from having an effective say in the economic and political rules which govern their affairs. As a result, states in the Majority World are often treated like Bantustans in South Africa, clients of Western powers, and their needs are neglected.
This inequality can be seen in the way people of different nations are treated in international relations. As in apartheid South Africa, there is a hierarchy of group rights among the world’s people: at the top are citizens of the USA, UK and France, with veto powers in the Security Council, NATO and IMF, World Bank and global economic regimes. Closely below them are members of the OECD, NATO and Western Alliance, who have the vote, access to courts and Western solidarity. Below them are other independent states represented on a regional basis and party to human rights conventions, then come citizens of independent states which do not adhere to human rights conventions and then occupied territories, indigenous people and peoples without states. At the bottom are refugees, asylum-seekers and stateless persons, although how they are treated depends on where they seek refuge. Although not classified by race, this hierarchy is effectively banded by colour. Nationality laws of most countries and the European Union explicitly support this ‘classification' of inequality among people.
Alexander identifies numerous "pillars of global apartheid" including:
Western countries have laws against racial discrimination and for human rights and political equality, but international decision-making has a legacy of inequality which some authors have compared to apartheid in South Africa.

The Unguarded Moment (film)

The Unguarded Moment is a 1956 thriller film directed by Harry Keller and released by Universal Pictures. Shot in Technicolor, the film was based on a story written by actress Rosalind Russell, and features Esther Williams, George Nader and John Saxon.
Plot.
Lois Conway (Williams) works as a music teacher at a local high school in a small town, where recently a woman was found murdered. When she starts receiving notes from an anonymous admirer, she suspects her favorite student Sandy (Wilder) is responsible, and tells him they could never be lovers. The notes grow more violent and when, in her latest letter, she is invited to meet at the school's lockers at night, Lois decides to visit, hoping to stop the young man. There, she is attacked by an initial shadowy figure, whom she later identifies as Leonard Bennett (Saxon), the high school's star football player. She successfully gets away, though drops her purse, and is aided by Lieutenant Harry Graham (Nader). Graham advises her to press charges, but Lois wants to drop the matter in hopes of it blowing over. Back at home, she notices her purse on her table, and aware that the thief is in her home, orders him to leave. As he bashes through the door to get away, Lois is now certain that Leonard is her attacker. Leonard is able to get home without his dominant and overbearing father (Andrews) noticing he is gone. Mr. Bennett lectures his son on the dangers of women, stimulated by the occurrence of him being left by his wife and Leonard's mother when he was very ill.
The following day, Lois reports the incident to the principal Pendleton (Tremayne), but when Leonard denies the whole matter, Pendleton protects the school's most valuable athletic asset by suggesting to Lois that she should provide evidence. Soon the story spreads around school, and with gossip surrounding Lois allegedly pursuing Leonard, both her personal and professional life becomes a mess. One day, she pulls him out of class and tries to reason with him, but he refuses to listen to her. Meanwhile, she grows closer to Graham, who does not understand why she is sympathetic to Leonard. Nonetheless, she decides to visit the Bennetts, but the father does not want her to interfere with his son and accuses her of seducing Leonard. He is startled, though, upon finding out the police are now involved in the matter. Mr. Bennett is unaware that Leonard again sneaked out of his room to visit a waitress whom he has dated in the past.
Sometime later, Graham accompanies Lois to a football game, where Graham is inspired to retrieve Leonard's fingerprints from his locker. It turns out the fingerprints match those found at Lois' place. At a school dance, she tries to warn Leonard about the police discovery, assuring him he will get into big trouble if he does not come clean. Leonard, for the first time, speaks truthfully to her, but they are interrupted by Mr. Bennett, who convinces Leonard Lois is manipulating him. Leonard asks her to meet him in the cloak room to discuss the matter, but Lois is unaware Mr. Bennett and Pendleton are hiding in the same room. Her presence convinces them she must be having an affair with the teenager. Lois, being tricked by Leonard, falls into Graham's arms, and finally allows him to arrest the kid.
At the police station, the now suspended Lois is brought in by Graham to get an honest confession from Leonard. During the interrogation, the couple is informed that another man has admitted to having committed the murder. Graham wants to continue prosecuting Leonard for breaking into Lois' apartment, but she wants to drop the case and orders him to bring the boy home. Back home, Lois is about to undress, when suddenly Mr. Bennett jumps out of her closet and starts assaulting her. At the same moment, Leonard, impressed by having been forgiven by his teacher, confesses to Graham that his father is responsible for the murders. Graham decides to share the news with Lois and arrives at her home just in time to save her from being murdered by Mr. Bennett. Bennett suffers a heart attack after attempting to flee the scene, and dies in front of Leonard.
Production.
The story of the film was written by actress Rosalind Russell (under the pen name C. A. McKnight, her mother's maiden name) in her screenwriting debut. In a 1951 draft of the story, Harry Graham was a fellow teacher instead of a policeman, and Leonard Bennett was revealed to be responsible for the murders, before being killed. Russell envisioned the film would be released under either "The Lie" or "The Hidden Heart", though she was not involved with the film's production due to other commitments, and the film was released as "The Unguarded Moment".
Actor John Saxon had yet to make a name for himself when the film went into production. He received the co-starring role after several screen tests, and the studio attempted to make him fill the void actor James Dean left when he died. For Esther Williams, the film was her first since her contract ended with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and it proved to be her first non-swimming dramatic role since "The Hoodlum Saint" (1946). In her autobiography, she noted:
Reception.
The film flopped at the box office. Saxon received warm reviews for his performance of Leonard Bennett. Some reviewers lauded Williams' performance, others lamented her change of milieu. In present days, the film is regarded as a B film, despite the fact it was heavily promoted in the 1950s.
According to Turner Classic Movies, Williams "unintentionally accents limitations as a dramatic actress though she still looks gorgeous. [.. While Esther Williams is the top-billed star of "The Unguarded Moment", it is Andrews' unexpectedly creepy performance that hijacks the film and imbues it with an underlying mood of malice and menace."

Geological Observations on South America

Geological Observations on South America is a book written by the English naturalist Charles Darwin. The book was published in 1846, and is based on his travels during the second voyage of HMS Beagle, commanded by captain Robert FitzRoy. The HMS Beagle arrived in South America to map out the coastlines and islands of the region for the British Navy. On the journey, Darwin collected fossils and plants, and recorded the continent's geological features.
It is the third book in a series of geology books written by Darwin, which also includes "The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs", published in 1842, and "Geological Observations on the Volcanic Islands visited during the Voyage of the H.M.S. Beagle", published in 1844. It took Darwin four years to write and complete the entire series, from 1842 to 1846. According to his diaries, "Geological Observations of South America" was written between July 1844 to April 1845. 
The text contains eight chapters along with appendices on Darwin's Mesozoic and Tertiary fossils. It describes his travels through the regions of modern Chile, Brazil, and Argentina, including the Pampas, Patagonia, and the Andes. Darwin, in a letter to the geologist Charles Lyell, wrote that the book was "dreadfully dull, yet much condensed." He put a great deal of effort into writing the book, but sardonically commented that "geologists never read each other's works, and that the only object in writing a book is a proof of earnestness, and that you do not form your opinions without undergoing labour of some kind."
In the book, Darwin voiced sceptical support for the "crater of elevation" theory. The theory proposed that volcanoes were not the product of lavas, but are pushed up from within. Darwin later rejected the theory when sufficient evidence was demonstrated by the geologist Charles Lyell to disprove it.
Francis Darwin, a botanist and the son of Charles Darwin, wrote that the book was significant for the "evidence which it brought forward to prove the slow interrupted elevation of the South American continent during a recent geological period." Darwin's geological work is not considered as notable as his work is biology, but nevertheless was important in advancing "the general reception of Lyell's teaching."

Abdominal migraine

Abdominal migraine is a disorder primarily of children which presents with episodes of abdominal pain without an accompanying headache. It is difficult to confirm the diagnosis as there are not a set of features that is specific and thus it can take time before the diagnosis is made. The condition is rare in adults.
History.
This condition was first described in 1921 by Buchanan.

Luteal support

Luteal support is the administration of medication, generally progesterone, progestins or GnRH agonists, to increase the success rate of implantation and early embryogenesis, thereby complementing and/or supporting the function of the corpus luteum.
The live birth rate is significantly higher with progesterone for luteal support in IVF cycles with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Co-treatment with GnRH agonists further improves outcomes, by a live birth rate RD of +16% (95% confidence interval +10 to +22%). 
Formulations of progesterone or progestin.
The main formulations of progesterone or progestins for luteal support are:
While daily intramuscular injections of progesterone-in-oil (PIO) have been the standard route of administration, PIO injections are not FDA-approved for use in pregnancy. A Cochrane review in 2013 stated that synthetic progesterone appears to be better than micronized progesterone. A Cochrane review in 2011 found no evidence favoring a specific route of administration, dosage or duration of progesterone for luteal support.
Progestins used for luteal support include dydrogesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate
For egg donation, there is evidence of a lower pregnancy rate and a higher cycle cancellation rate when the progesterone supplementation in the recipient is commenced "prior" to oocyte retrieval from the donor, as compared to commenced day of oocyte retrieval or the day after.
Other substances tested in luteal phase.
On the other hand, overall, the addition of estrogen or hCG as adjunctives to progesterone do not appear to affect outcomes pregnancy rate and live birth rate in IVF. In fact, luteal support with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) alone or as a supplement to progesterone has been associated with a higher risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). The use of hCG should therefore be avoided for luteal support. Low molecular weight heparin as luteal support may improve the live birth rate but has substantial side effects and has no reliable data on long-term effects. Glucocorticoids such as cortisol do not seem to be effective for luteal support.

Daniel Deffayet

Daniel Deffayet (May 23, 1922 – December 27, 2002) was a French classical saxophonist. He was the professor of saxophone at the Conservatoire de Paris where he succeeded Marcel Mule after Mule's retirement in 1968. He held this position until 1988.
Biography.
Daniel Deffayet was born in Paris, France on May 23, 1922. He began studying solfege at age seven, violin at age eight, and saxophone at age twelve. Entranced by the warmth and beauty of the saxophone's tone quality, which he heard through the recordings of Marcel Mule in the 1930s, Deffayet began to study the instrument with Mule in 1938. When the class of saxophone was established in 1942, and Mule appointed the professor at the Conservatoire de Paris, Deffayet was a member. In the Spring of 1943, he won First Prize for Saxophone, First Named. He also graduated in Chamber Music (1944, J. Benvenuti's class), violin (1945, A. Tourret's class), and harmony (M. Durflé's class).
In October, 1940, Deffayet began replacing Mule for various engagements at the Opéra and Opéra-Comique. As an orchestral musician, Deffayet has performed under the direction of such famous conductors as Dorati, Kubelik, Boulez, Bernstein, Karajan, Maazel, Markevitch, Martinon, Monteux, Leinsdorf, Paray, Villa-Lobos, Fricsay, Cluytens, Munch, and Ozawa. From 1966 until his death in 1988, Herbert von Karajan called him to be his accredited saxophonist for important recordings and to play solos with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. He has also played regularly with several Parisian orchestras, including the Orchestre National, Opera, Philharmonique, and many others.
Deffayet began his teaching career in 1948, and was a professor at municipal Conservatories in Paris, the Ecole municipale de musique de Beauvais, and at the Conservatoire du Mans. For many years he taught beside Allard Mayor, who created the Conservatoire of the 10th arrondissement, the first of the municipal Conservatories in Paris. Tuition was free, to provide a larger access for students to music; some students have thus been able to enter the Conservatoire de Paris.
When Mule retired in 1968 after 25 years of teaching, Deffayet succeeded him and continued the spirit of the French saxophone school. He remained there over 20 years, and was appointed Honorary Professor of the Conservatoire de Paris.
In 1953, the year he debuted as a soloist, playing Ibert's Concertino da camera, he formed the "Quatuor de saxophones Daniel Deffayet". The quartet performed numerous concerts in France, and important tours have taken the group to England, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, the United States, Japan, and Korea, until 1988, when the group disbanded.

Suomensarja

Suomensarja (sometimes also Suomi-sarja) (‘Finland Series’) was the second highest level of league format association football in Finland from 1936 to 1972.
Before the inauguration of the Suomensarja, there had been, in 1930–1935, special qualification matches for the right to play in the Mestaruussarja, ‘Championship series’. A proper league format competition on this level began in 1936 with the 1936 Suomensarja.
In the autumn of 1969, the Finnish football underwent a league system reform, and the Suomensarja was renamed "II divisioona", or 2nd Division, with regional sections.
In 1973, this level of football in Finland became nationwide, and the new name was 1. divisioona, present-day Ykkönen.
The format of the competition on the second level of league format football in Finland changed several times over the years. Suomensarja had regional sections, with the best teams in each section finally competing against each other for promotion into the Mestaruussarja. The number of regional sections would vary from two to six.

John Draper Perrin

John Draper Perrin (August 26, 1890 – September 19, 1967) was a Canadian entrepreneur, mining executive and civic leader.
Life and career.
Perrin was born in Medicine Hat, North-West Territories, to William Perrin, a former British soldier in the Wolseley Expedition, (1st Battalion, 60th King's Royal Rifles) and Sergeant in the North West Mounted Police and Sarah Lytle; both parents were Irish immigrants. Perrin attended school in Regina and Winnipeg, including Aberdeen School. 
He worked for the Canadian Pacific Railway land office from 1906 to 1908, eventually embarking on a mining career. Perrin founded and developed the San Antonio Gold Mine, serving as president from 1931 to 1962. The San Antonio mine was the first dividend paying metal mine between the Great Lakes and the Rocky Mountains in Canada. He financed development of the mining town of Bissett, Manitoba.
Having successfully secured the financial support of Noah Timmins and Hollinger Mines Perrin took the stock public in 1934, one of the first in Manitoba on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The offering made him one of Canada's wealthiest citizens. He was also an early adopter of commercial aviation, organizing charter service Wings Limited, later purchased by Canadian Pacific Airways. Perrin has been credited as the first person in the world to use an aircraft to access a remote mining site. He was financier and president of the minor pro Winnipeg Warriors Hockey Club in the 1950s. Perrin was inducted with the 1955-56 Warriors team into the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame in the Champions category as winners of the Edinburgh Trophy.
Perrin was Chairman and a key leader in the Greater Winnipeg Victory Loan organization, which put on If Day on February 19, 1942. He also served during the Second World War as National Vice Chairman of The Canadian Red Cross Prisoners of War Parcels Committee. In this capacity Perrin was the organizer and sole Director of the Winnipeg Prisoners of War Parcels Packaging Plant(the only such facility in western Canada) which packaged 2,604,990 parcels for shipment overseas to POW's. Beginning in 1948 he was also Chairman of the The Children's Hospital of Winnipeg Building Committee, which successfully raised the funds necessary to build the Children's Hospital on William Avenue, opened in 1958 and now part of the Health Sciences Centre. Perrin served as a Director on the Board of the Children's Hospital from 1946 until his death in 1967. He was President of the Manitoba Club in 1953-54. At one time he owned the rural property that now makes up the largest portion of Beaudry Provincial Park (Manitoba), on the Assiniboine River near Winnipeg.
Perrin died in Winnipeg and is buried at St. Johns Cathedral Cemetery.
Family.
Perrin was married for 53 years to Ruth Taylor Litle; they had one son and three daughters, Alix Elizabeth, Sarah "Sally" Ruth and Marion Joan. His son J. D. "Jack" Perrin, Jr. worked in the family businesses and in their hockey operations, for which he was inducted into the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame and the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame and Museum. He owned Winnipeg's Olympic Rink and Fort Garry Hotel. Perrin's son-in-law Duncan Jessiman served as Chair of the Board of Regents of the University of Winnipeg and was appointed to the Senate of Canada from Manitoba. Perrin's son-in-law W. J. "Jack" Hopwood served in the 1967 Winnipeg Pan American Games organizing committee and as President of the St. Charles Country Club and the Winnipeg Squash Racquet Club. Musician Johnny Perrin is his great grandson.

<doc id="36579809" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36579809" title="Guaranteed Annual Income">
Guaranteed Annual Income

Guaranteed Annual Income in Canada, refers to various proposals discussed in Canada since the 1970s, to implement guaranteed minimum income or basic income; herein referred to as NIT (for negative income tax) and UD (for Universal Demogrant) respectively.
Models.
The first model encompassed under the GAI is the Negative income tax (NIT). Negative Income Tax works on the assumption that families who earn below the low-income threshold should receive aid in the form of direct grants, rather than paying taxes. This allows a family unit to use resources as it best sees fit rather than being constrained by the traditional income assistance programs. Experiments utilizing the Negative Income Tax model have been completed in the United States in the late 1960s through the early 1970s. 
The NIT model was also tested in Canada in the 1970s in Manitoba; it was called the Mincome experiment. It allowed every family unit to receive a minimum cash benefit, with every dollar over the benefit amount taxed at 60%. The results showed a modest impact on labor markets, with family working hours decreasing 5%. These potential economic costs can be offset by the opportunity cost of more time for family and education. Mothers spent more time rearing newborns, and the educational impacts are regarded as a success. Students in these families showed higher test scores and lower dropout rates. There was also an increase in adults continuing education.
The second model that falls under the Guaranteed Annual Income concept is the Unconditional Basic Income also known as the universal demogrant (UD) model. This is a payment to all persons regardless of income. It is usually favored by those who see the GAI as a right of citizenship and whose purpose is to eliminate poverty through the basic income and lead to more equal sharing of the economic benefits of society.
Implementation of similar proposals.
In Namibia, back in 2008 a non-profit coalition implemented a monthly cash grant of ~13 U.S. dollars to every Namibian citizen until they were of pension age where they would then be eligible for the existing universal state old age pension. The results were outstanding in improving health outcomes due to child malnutrition and absolute poverty declined. To help deal with inflation of prices and the low-income/poverty in Iran, the government is now providing a general subsidy to every citizen each month to guarantee a basic income; with results that are showing a great deal of promise. Brazil has also implemented a Citizens Basic Income for all of its citizens, again with positive results in terms of health and economic stimulation.
Criticism.
There are some obvious impediments to the implementation of a Guaranteed Annual Income in Canada. First, at the heart of the issue is whether or not work incentives would decrease and by extension, the eventual cost of a nationwide GAI would balloon beyond feasibility. Eliminating poverty can be a costly endeavour depending on the support levels and taxation rates that are chosen by the government. If individuals stop working economic growth and productivity may be jeopardized. Economic growth leads back to the cost issue, where substantial public revenue must be used to ensure basic economic security for all. Depending on the approach taken by the government there are ways to create a cost-neutral GAI.
Another obstacle to the concept of Guaranteed Annual Income would be single employer subsidization and an incentive for employers to reduce workers’ wages, as the government will guarantee their employee’s a minimum living standard.
A third obstruction to the GAI is the public argument of “why should the lazy be paid”? Those individuals that choose not to “work” insults the moral principle of reciprocity. The removal of a tie between income and contribution encourages parasitism.
Financial model.
For any income earned up to a break point value, the government would provide a progressively small cash transfer. The concept is summarized by the formula B=G-TY where B is the net amount paid by the government to the citizen (if it is a negative value) or tax paid (if a positive value), G is minimum guaranteed payment, Y is the gross annual income, and T is the tax rate. As such, if a person has no income, they will receive a minimum guaranteed payment (G); all subsequent income is taxed at a rate T which is less than 100 percent. A classic diagram in economics illustrating this is shown in Figure 1. It is important to remember that while the y axis demonstrates increasing gross income, the x axis displays decreasing number of hours worked. With a negative income tax, individuals who have no income would earn a minimum amount (represented on Figure 1 as a value equal to ‘C’) instead of nothing (A). As part of a traditional welfare system, individuals receiving assistance would be taxed at a rate of 100% (demonstrated in the line connecting ‘C’ and ‘D’) and as such the net income level is unchanged. However, negative income tax provides an incentive for those receiving government assistance to work (as represented by the line C to D’), as they are taxed at a rate less than 100%. Last ‘F’ is the break-point value for annual income, above which an individual would not qualify for assistance.
History.
In 1970 the Department of National Health and Welfare issued a white paper which both emphasized the ability of NIT to decrease poverty but at the potential expense of decreased work incentive. Specifically, the white paper stated:
Following this stance, the National Council of Welfare advocated in 1976 for the implementation of the guaranteed annual income in Canada.
In order to determine real-life responses to NIT implementation, the US government undertook four income maintenance experiments; they transpired in New Jersey and Pennsylvania (1968-1972), rural areas of North Carolina and Iowa (1970–72), Seattle and Denver (1970–78), and Gary Indiana (1971-1974). These prospective large-scale field studies were truly remarkable due to their size and the fact that families were randomized to either an experimental arm (i.e., NIT) or control arm (usual tax practice). Three major objectives of these interventions were to measure the labour supply response of NIT recipients, understand the effect of varying the base guarantee level and tax rate, and to make a better estimate of the cost of implementing such a program. 
In Canada, an analogous experiment called Mincome took place in Winnipeg and Dauphin, Manitoba between 1974 - 1979. Importantly, the city of Dauphin served as a saturation site, since all 10,000 community members were eligible to participate (the elderly and disabled were exempt from the four American NIT experiments); four foci of Mincome were an economic arm (examining labour response), a sociologic research division (examining family formation and community cohesion), an administrative programme, and a statistical division. Unfortunately, the ambitious project ran into significant budgetary problems early on and neither the newly elected Progressive Conservative government in Ottawa nor the Tory government in Manitoba felt strongly about providing further funding. As stated by Hum and Simpson:
Ultimately the Dauphin data which was collected at great expense to the taxpayers and time from participants (in the first social experiment ever conducted in Canada) remains largely unexamined. However, some of the participant interviews were released and provide support for the efficacy of NIT. For instance Amy Richardson, a mother of six whose husband was disabled said:
Doreen Henderson, a stay at home mother whose husband worked as a janitor also appreciated the benefits of NIT; she said:
In general, the average reduction in work force in the US sites was about 13%, with most of the reduction in labour from secondary (typically the wives) and tertiary (typically older children) earners as opposed to the primary earner (usually the husbands). In Mincome the reduction in work effort was more modest: 1% for men and 3% for wives. It is important to remember that when the experiments were conducted, it was less socially acceptable for women to work outside the home. According to Rossi and Lyall only 40% of wives who participated in the experiment worked outside the home and their earning power was low due to limited and discontinuous work experience. As such, the authors contend that wives’ labour involvement was marginal and when faced with competing tasks of looking after the household and raising children, the additional income provided by NIT was sufficient to justify an exit from the labor market. However this phenomenon was predominantly observed in Caucasian wives whereas African American and Hispanic women exhibited a small increase in labor force participation. Interestingly, the decrease in labor involvement of teenage children was correlated to higher rates of high school graduation. A potential explanation is that the additional income from government assistance meant that young adults could stay in school as opposed to join the workforce in order to support their family. This has the potential positive long term effect of allowing youth to find higher wage employment. In summary, the work supply response to NIT was very complex however data from the American studies would argue against a dramatic decline in the labour force.

<doc id="36580062" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36580062" title="Portland (steam tug 1947)">
Portland (steam tug 1947)

Portland (or the Portland) is a sternwheel steamboat built in 1947 for the Port of Portland (the port district in Portland, Oregon, United States) that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The vessel is moored at the Willamette River seawall next to Tom McCall Waterfront Park in downtown Portland when not underway, and the "Portland" now hosts the Oregon Maritime Museum and is owned by the non-profit organization of the same name.
Last of her kind.
The "Portland" was built in 1947, at a time when steam paddlewheels were giving way to more modern propulsion systems. The "Portland" was originally proposed as a diesel-powered screw-driven vessel, but at the request of the Columbia River Pilots Association she was built with more traditional propulsion. As a result, she was the last steam-powered, sternwheel tugboat built in the United States. She was also the last such vessel still in service in the U.S. at the time of her retirement in 1981. For these reasons, she is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as "an outstanding representative of her type and method of construction."
The "Portland" was built to replace her predecessor of the same name, built in 1919. Unlike her predecessor, the present "Portland" is built with a steel hull, and a wooden superstructure.
Service history.
The "Portland" was delivered to the Port of Portland on August 29, 1947, and was operated by both Willamette Tug & Barge and Shaver Transportation until she was retired in 1981. By that time, the Port of Portland was serving oil supertankers from Alaska that were too large for the "Portland" to assist, and container ships with bow thrusting capabilities that reduced the need for tug assistance.
Oregon Maritime Museum.
In 1991, nearly ten years after the "Portland" was retired, ownership was transferred to the Oregon Maritime Museum for $1, where restoration work began with the intent of turning her into a stationary museum ship. Interest and fundraising for the project exceeded expectations, allowing the "Portland" to be restored to a functioning, seaworthy condition. Restoration work was completed in 1993. In 1994, she was moved to her present location, at Tom McCall Waterfront Park in downtown Portland, where she is available most days for tours. In 2002, the static displays for the Oregon Maritime Museumcalled the Oregon Maritime Center and Museum until 2004were brought on board and are now a part of the tour.
Notable events.
1952 freeing "S.G. Follis".
The heavy-laden "S.G. Follis", inbound to Portland, ran firm aground at the Sauvie Island dike. Other tugs tried to free her to no avail when the "Portland" came on the scene. With lines fast to "S.G. Follis," the wash from "Portland's" paddle wheel in full reverse began to loosen the sand under "S.G. Follis," allowing the "Portland" to work her free. 
1957 "Portland" saves the Hawthorne Bridge.
On April 14, 1957, two ships set to be scrapped broke from their moorings and collided with the Hawthorne Bridge. Two of the most powerful diesel tugs available were unable to do much more than relieve some of the strain from the bridge. The "Portland" was able to free the ships and tow them to moorings before the strain broke the bridge. The Columbia River Pilots Association saw this incident as justification for having insisted that the "Portland" be a steam-powered sternwheeler.
2008 grounding.
In 2008, the "Portland" was set to participate in the first steamboat race on the Columbia River in more than half a century. She was set to race against the sternwheeler "Columbia Gorge", as a part of the Sternwheeler Days Festival in Cascade Locks, Oregon. "Portland"s steering locked, and she ran into the bank, damaging her wheel. Without power or steering, she drifted towards the Bonneville Dam until another tug secured a line and towed her to safety. A Coast Guard investigation cited a problem with an improperly repaired gear in the steering system dating back to 1997. "Portland" and "Columbia Gorge" have since raced at least three times, with the "Portland" winning two of the races.
2012 collision.
As the "Portland" was docking for the Heritage Maritime Festival in St. Helens, she backed into the Portland Pirate Festival's tall ship "Royaliste". While no one was injured, significant damage was done to "Royaliste". As of July 2012, an investigation was ongoing.

Holly Springs Female Institute

The Holly Springs Female Institute was an early female seminary for white women, founded in Holly Springs, Mississippi in 1836.
By 1838 the school had over 80 students and owned two pianos. The state of Mississippi granted the school a charter in 1839, at which time it had five faculty members including the Rev. C. Parish, president of the school. The charter was, evidently in error, assigned to the "Holly Springs Female Academy."
By 1839, the school had a permanent building in the Greek revival style.
In 1841 the confusion over the name encouraged an Episcopalian clergyman named C. A. Foster to open a rival school also called the Holly Springs Female Institute. In early 1842, for reasons that are not clear, Foster replaced Parish as president of the original school.
The school building was used as a hospital during the Civil War. The building was destroyed by the Union Army in 1864 and the school was unable to reopen.

"Dave's Picks Volume 3" was the third in the "Dave's Picks" series of Grateful Dead archival releases, the successor to the "Road Trips" series. It was produced as a limited edition of 12,000 copies.
Critical reception.
On All About Jazz, Doug Collette said, "Previous entries in Grateful Dead archive series have documented the quietly courageous, not to mention authoritative, fashion, by which keyboardist Keith Godchaux made a place of himself in the iconic band's lineup late in 1971, having been enlisted when charter member Ron "Pigpen" McKernan became too ill to tour regularly. But neither "Dick's Picks Volume 35" (Grateful Dead/Rhino, 2005) nor "Road Trips Volume 1 Number 3" (Grateful Dead/Rhino, 2009) made the case so vividly as does this latest entry in "Dave's Pick's Volume 3"."

Pedro Fernández Manrique

Pedro Fernández Manrique (c1500–1540) was a Spanish Roman Catholic bishop and cardinal.
Biography.
Pedro Fernández Manrique was born in Aguilar de Campoo ca. 1500, the son of Fernández Manrique, 2nd Marquis of Aguilar de Campoo and María Manrique de Lara, daughter of Manrique de Lara, 1st Duke of Nájera. He was educated at the University of Salamanca in the 1520s.
In 1525, Charles I of Spain named him "maestrescula" of the cathedral chapter of Salamanca Cathedral, a post that also made him chancellor of the University of Salamanca. The cathedral chapter, however, elected Martín de Espinosa, an auditor of the Roman Rota, for the same position. Espinosa ultimately prevailed in the dispute over this double appointment. In compensation, Charles I of Spain in 1530 made him major chaplain of the Chapel of the New Monarchs in the Cathedral of Toledo.
Six months later, Charles nominated him to be Bishop of Canarias and he was elected as bishop on June 22, 1530. He was transferred to the see of Ciudad Rodrigo on December 14, 1530. On April 11, 1537, he was transferred to the see of Córdoba, entering the diocese on March 2, 1538. He participated in the "Cortes" held in Toledo beginning on October 15, 1538.
At the request of King Charles I, Pope Paul III created Fernández Manrique a cardinal priest in the consistory of December 20, 1538. He received the red hat on April 26, 1540 and the titular church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo on May 21, 1540.
He died of the plague in Rome on October 7, 1540. He was temporarily buried in Santa Maria in Aracoeli, and his remains were later transferred to Spain and reburied.

2012 Olympics one minute of silence campaign

The 2012 Olympics one minute of silence campaign refers to an international campaign created to persuade the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to hold one minute of silence at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics to remember the Israeli athletes killed in the Munich massacre at the 1972 Olympics by the Palestinian terrorist organization Black September. Support for the campaign has come from a number of high-ranking officials and governments, including the United States Congress, U.S. President Barack Obama, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, U.S. Republican Party presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the Italian Parliament, the Australian Parliament, the Canadian Parliament, the German Parliament, and German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle.
The IOC declined the request for a minute of silence at the opening ceremony, but IOC officials honoured the victims at a ceremony organised by the Israeli embassy and the Jewish community in London during the Olympics on August 6, 2012. A further ceremony was planned in Germany on the anniversary of the attack on September 5, 2012 at the military airfield of Fürstenfeldbruck. IOC President Rogge led a spontaneous minute of silence during a ceremony on July 23, 2012 which promoted the Olympic truce, marking the first time ever that the IOC honored the Israeli victims in a ceremony inside an Olympic village.
Background.
The Munich massacre occurred during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, in southern West Germany, when members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage and eventually murdered by the Palestinian group Black September. The kidnappers killed eleven Israeli athletes and coaches, as well as a West German police officer.
Following the attack, a memorial service was held in the Olympic Stadium, although the International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Avery Brundage did not refer to the athletes during his speech. Since the memorial, the IOC has repeatedly rejected calls to commemorate the victims during the Olympics or hold an official memorial service.
Initial attempts.
The families of the murdered athletes have attempted since the massacre to receive official remembrance for those killed in the massacre, starting with the Montreal Olympics in 1976.
Ankie Spitzer, the widow of Israeli coach Andrei Spitzer, has helped lead the campaign, and has described the idea of a minute of silence or other form of commemoration as "natural in our families' eyes." However, Spitzer said,
"But they told us very clearly: 'There are 21 Arab delegations that will leave if we say something about the Israeli athletes.' So I said: 'Let them leave if they can't understand what the Olympics are all about – a connection between people through sport.'"
Since the Montreal Olympics, the IOC has continued to reject any official commemoration of the victims. Spitzer explained that the International Olympics Committee says it's not in the "protocol of the opening ceremony to have a commemoration." However, Spitzer said, "Well, my husband coming home in a coffin was not in the protocol either. This was the blackest page in Olympic history. These 11 athletes were part of the Olympic family, they were not accidental tourists. They should be remembered as part of the Olympic framework."
2012 London Olympics campaign.
In April 2012, the year of the 40th anniversary of the Munich Massacre, an online petition was created titled “Tell the International Olympic Committee: 40 Years is Enough!” to urge the International Olympic Committee to honour the memory of the eleven murdered athletes in one minute of silence. The Jewish Community Center of Rockland County, NY, initiated the petition with Ankie Spitzer, the wife of Andrei Spitzer, who was killed at the Munich Olympics. The petition says, "Just one minute — at the 2012 London Summer Olympics and at every Olympic Game, to promote peace." When the London Olympics took place in July, over 100,000 people had signed the petition in support of one minute of silence.
Later during the same month, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon wrote an official letter to the International Olympic Committee, in which he requested the commemoration of the eleven murdered athletes in a minute of silence, as well as an emphasis on the Olympic principles of equality and brotherhood. Ayalon said, "We must remain vigilant against acts of hate and intolerance that stand in contrast to the ideals of the international Olympics."
Support for 2012 campaign.
Support for the one minute of silence campaign for the London 2012 Olympics emerged from across the globe. Calls for a minute of silence also came from various parliaments and government officials. In addition, over 100,000 people signed a petition in support of one minute of silence.
United Kingdom.
"This Assembly notes the widespread, cross-party, support for one minute's silence during the London Olympic Games to mark the 10th Olympiad since and 40th anniversary of the terrorist massacre of Israeli competitors and their coaches during the 1972 Munich Olympics. 
This Assembly urges the Mayor of London to use his position and influence to ensure an official minute's silence remembrance is observed in the Olympic Park during the Opening or Closing Ceremonies of the London Olympic Games."
International Olympic Committee response.
The International Olympic Committee refused to hold one minute of silence at the 40th anniversary of the Munich massacre. IOC President Jacques Rogge said that, "We feel that the opening ceremony is an atmosphere that is not fit to remember such a tragic incident." However, Rogge said that the IOC would honour the victims of the Munich massacre at a reception in London during the Olympics on August 6, and that IOC officials would attend a ceremony in Germany on the anniversary of the attack on September 5 at the military airfield of Fürstenfeldbruck, where most of the Israelis died during a botched rescue attempt. Rogge also said that he has attended several ceremonies with the Israeli Olympic Committee and Israeli athletes during recent games.
Despite the refusal to honour the victims during the opening ceremony of the Olympics, on July 23 IOC President Jacques Rogge led a minute of silence during a ceremony which promoted the Olympic truce. This was the first time that the IOC honoured the Israeli victims in a ceremony inside an Olympic village. Rogge started by “honoring the memory of the 11 Israeli Olympians who shared the ideals that have brought us together in this beautiful Olympic village" and said that the Israelis “came to Munich in the spirit of peace and solidarity.” Rogge added, "we owe it to them to keep that spirit alive and to remember them.” In response to Rogge's spontaneous minute of silence, Ilana Romano, the widow of Israeli weightlifter Yossef Romano, said, "He is trying to do the bare minimum,” and called it "shameful." Ankie Spitzer, the widow of Israeli coach Andrei Spitzer, also criticized Rogge, saying, “This is not the right solution, to hold some ceremony in front of 30 or 40 people. We asked for a moment of silence at the opening ceremony, not for someone to mumble something in front of a few dozen people.” At the London commemoration on August 6, Romano told Rogge he had "submitted to terrorism", and would be "written down on the pages of history as ... a president who violated the Olympic charter calls for brotherhood, friendship and peace." Their attacks were applauded by the audience, but afterwards some attendees privately expressed discomfort at the sustained attack on Rogge, and Andrew Gilbert, formerly chair of Limmud International tweeted that “the memorial service for Munich 11 became an anti-IOC rally and heavy-handed humiliation of Rogge".'
Reactions to IOC response.
Jibril Rajoub, the president of the Palestinian Olympic Committee, thanked Jacques Rogge in a letter for refusing to hold a minute of silence, saying that it promotes the "spread of racism" and that the Palestinian Olympic team was prepared to "confront the Israeli provocations," referring to a minute of silence. Rajoub added that "sport in Palestine is a means to achieve national goals" as well as “a tool of struggle to present the Palestinian cause,” and that "sports are a bridge to love, interconnection, and spreading of peace among nations." Al-Hayat al-Jadida, the official daily newspaper of the Palestinian National Authority referred to the Munich massacre as “the Munich Operation.” Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon denounced the use of the term "racist" by Rajoub, and insisted that the murder of the Israeli Olympians due to their nationality was the racist act.
Ankie Spitzer and Ilana Romano urged members of the crowd to stand for a spontaneous minute of silence during the opening ceremony. Spitzer claimed that Rogge was using a Munich ceremony organised by the Israelis and the London Jewish community on August 6 as an excuse not to hold the moment of silence. Spitzer said, “Jacques Rogge is using it as a hideaway. If the Israeli embassy and London Jewish community were not organizing it, he would not have any memorial to go to."
When the Israeli delegation entered the Olympic Stadium, NBC sportscaster Bob Costas noted that the International Olympic Committee denied the requests for a minute of silence, saying in an interview that "many people find that denial more than puzzling but insensitive." During the opening ceremony, Costas referred to the spontaneous minute of silence the week before as insufficient, saying, "Still, for many, tonight with the world watching is the true time and place to remember those who were lost and how and why they died."
Congressman Eliot Engel condemned the IOC's refusal, saying, "Shame on you!" Joseph Potasnik, vice president of the New York board of rabbis, said, "37,360: these are the number of minutes in the entire Olympics and they didn't find one."
Barbara Berger, whose brother, David Mark Berger was killed in the Munich massacre, felt dismayed and offended at the rejection, explaining that "A moment of silence may not seem like much. But to us, to the families who lost so much, that silent respect will speak volumes." Such a moment 
Aly Raisman, a Jewish-American gymnast who won a gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics, expressed her support for a minute of silence at the Olympics, saying that, “The fact it was on the 40th anniversary is special, and winning the gold today means a lot to me. If there had been a moment's silence, I would have supported it and respected it.”
On August 9, former Canadian justice minister and attorney-general and current member of parliament Irwin Cotler wrote a last-minute plea to Rogge to hold a minute of silence at the closing ceremony of the Olympics. Cotler wrote:
The refusal of the IOC to observe a moment of silence on the 40th anniversary of the Munich massacre – the slaughter of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches for no other reason than that they were Israelis and Jews – is as offensive as it is incomprehensible. 
It is not hard to infer that not only were the athletes killed because they were Israeli and Jewish, but that the moment of silence is being denied them also because they are Israeli and Jewish.
These 11 Israeli Olympians were part of the Olympic family, they were murdered as members of the Olympic family, they should be remembered by the Olympic family at these Olympic Games themselves.
Cotler said that the IOC's “steadfast reluctance” to hold a minute of silence ignores and mocks "the calls for a moment of silence by Government leaders... and the sustained international public campaign and anguished civil society appeals.” Cotler also mentioned that such a memorial would not be unprecedent, mentioning the minute of silence observed in memory of the Georgian athlete Nodar Kumaritashvili in the 2010 Olympics, the 2002 Olympics' memorialization of the victims of 9/11, and the 2012 Olympics' memorialization of the victims of the 2005 London Bombings, which happened the day after London was awarded the games. Cotler noted that the last two terrorist attacks he mentioned were not connected to the Olympics either.
Non-IOC commemorations.
On July 25, 2012, the Italian Chamber of Deputies held a minute of silence to mark the 40th anniversary of the Munich massacre and in honour of the victims of the massacre. On July 29, members of the Italian Olympic delegation also held a moment of silence. Those in attendance consisted of approximately 30 individuals, as well as the Italian Tourism and Sports Minister Piero Gnudi, the head of the Italian Olympic Committee Gianni Petrucci, the Chairman of the Israeli Olympic Committee Zvi Varshaviak, and the head of the Israeli delegation Efraim Zinger.
On July 27, 2012, over 20,000 people throughout London attended a "Minute for Munich" program organised by the British Zionist Federation. On the same day, a memorial was held in Trafalgar Square that was attended by approximately 400 people to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Munich massacre. The event, organised by the British Israel Coalition, was "a response to the International Olympic Committee's sustained refusal to include a minute of silence in the opening ceremony due to be held tonight."
British Prime Minister David Cameron agreed to attend a commemoration at Guildhall to mark the 40th anniversary of the Munich massacre and in honour of the victims of the massacre. Prime Minister Cameron said, “It's right that in 2012 – 40 years on from the Munich Olympics – we remember the Israeli team members who were killed there."
Israelis marked the 40th anniversary of the Munich massacre in London, during which prayers were read for the 11 murdered Israelis, wreaths were laid, and a plaque was unveiled approximately four miles from the Olympic Stadium. London Mayor Boris Johnson attended the event, and recalled watching the massacre in 1972 unfold when he was 8 years old. Johnson said, “What sticks in my mind is that sense of sacrilege and a feeling of horror that the world's greatest sporting event should suffer such an attack, and that an attack should be mounted against people who had been training for what should have been the greatest event in their lives. And I think the world watched with a sense of numb disbelief as those events unfolded because sport should transcend politics." In addition, Israeli TV commentators held an informal 30-second silence during the Olympics opening ceremony.
On July 31, a minute of silence was held aboard an Easy Jet flight from London to Israel as their airplane flew over Munich, Germany. The captain of the flight agreed to a request from the passengers to hold a minute of silence, and asked passengers to do so.
A memorial ceremony was held on August 6, organised by the National Olympic Committee of Israel, the embassy of Israel in London, and the Jewish Committee for the London Games. IOC president Jacques Rogge, British Prime Minister David Cameron, London mayor Boris Johnson, Israeli Sports and Culture Minister Limor Livnat and other representatives attended the ceremony. A message of support was read from Charles, the Prince of Wales. Prime Minister Cameron said:
Cameron also recalled the 7 July 2005 London bombings, and that Britain too had suffered from terrorism. Livnat said that "not observing a silence grants a moral victory to the evil." Ankie Spitzer said "Is the IOC only interested in power and money and politics? Did they forget that they are supposed to promote peace, brotherhood and fair play?" Spitzer and Ilana Romana, who had previously requested that Rogge be banned from the ceremony, said that the IOC had discriminated against the dead athletes because they were Israelis and Jews. They added that they were personally hurt and felt insulted by Rogge. Spitzer exclaimed, "Shame on you!" in reference to IOC President Rogge for refusing to hold one minute of silence.
US gymnast and gold medal winner at the 2012 London Olympics, Aly Raisman, who won her gold on the floor exercise to the music of Hava Nagila, while the music was not chosen specifically with the Munich 11 in mind, she said she would have supported and respected a moment of silence in tribute.
At the JCC Maccabi Games opening ceremonies at the JCC Rockland in suburban New York, Ankie Spitzer will lead a livestreamed, worldwide minute of silence to honour the 11 Israeli athletes who were killed in the Munich massacre.

Keedz

Keedz is a musical project of a group of young French singers who release songs as a choir accompanied by electro-disco-dance influences. In 2008, Keedz released a studio album entitled "Stand on the Word" containing 11 tracks on Elias Music / Mercury Records / Universal Music. It was produced by Julien Jabre, Jimmy Mikaoui and Laurent Tordjman with David Eugène Joubert and Phyliss McKoy Joubert, with the latter having written 7 of the 11 tracks. The vocals were by formation named The Children of God. 
Keedz claim to fame was the big commercial success of the title track "Stand on the Word" from the album. The single remixed by MiMa made up of Michael Tordjman and Maxime Desprez was a remake of a Joubert Singers song. Many drew similarities between it and the musical project Justice, particularly their single "D.A.N.C.E.", but this was refuted later, saying Keedz was an independent project on its own. The Keedz release was accompanied by a music video which became equally popular. The single has been in the SNEP French Singles Chart since October 2011 totalling 28 weeks until end of July 2012 and reaching its peak position at #12 on chart dated 23 June 2012. 
Keedz' version of "Stand on the Word" was used as a short introduction to "Le Grand Journal" broadcast on Canal+ for the week 29 September to 3 October 2008. "Le Grand Journal" picks weekly one particular song (called "coming next") as a jingle to its introduction and changes it on a weekly basis. The choices prove usually to be future hits. The Keedz version of the song was also used in 2008 in an episode of the Australian television series "Underbelly".

The Rise and Fall of English Montreal

The Rise and Fall of English Montreal is a 1993 Canadian documentary film directed by William Weintraub and produced by the National Film Board of Canada in Montreal.
The film deals with exodus of English-speaking Quebecers that began in the 1960s and was accelerated by the Quebec general election, 1976.
Overview.
The film includes interviews with English-speaking professionals and students that are preparing to leave Montreal, joining an exodus of 300,000 anglophones that left the province in the last two decades.
This exodus is reflected in over 100 English-speaking schools that have closed in recent years. The students at McGill University and Concordia University cite better work opportunities outside of the province as a reason for leaving. Frequently the lack of a Francophone background is cited as an obstacle for anglophones, even for those that are bilingual. 
Weintraub also looks at the role that the Office québécois de la langue française plays in making anglophone businesses comply with language laws, calling for the use of French language signage in favour of English. 
The film juxtaposes a worried minority's present position with their past in Montreal, where English-speakers once outnumbered Francophones, where the mayor was English-speaking and it was difficult to be served in French in downtown department stores. 
The film also addresses key moments of significance to the Anglo commununity in Montreal, such as the demolition of the Van Horne Mansion in 1973. Weintraub also displays the significant role that Anglo business has played in cultivating Montreal's overseas image as a "North American Paris."
As the Anglo youth leave Montreal and the elderly stay behind, the film poses questions about the future and sustainability of the Anglo community in Montreal and the province itself.

Bend in the Road

Bend in the Road is an album by British blues musician Jeremy Spencer, who was a member of Fleetwood Mac from 1967–71. It is his fifth official solo album and was released on the Propelz Records label on 21 April 2012, to coincide with Record Store Day.
Recording.
Spencer continued his tradition of recording songs by Elmore James and Homesick James, and also took inspiration from poetry and passages from the Bible. Some of Spencer's songs were written during his time with Fleetwood Mac, while some others dated from the 1970s and 1980s. The track "Refugees" is a re-working of "Flee", from Spencer's 1979 album of the same name.
The album was recorded during the first half of 2010, at Tempermill Studio in Ferndale, Michigan. For his backing band, Spencer used a new group of Detroit-based musicians: guitarist Brett Lucas, bass guitarist James Simonson and drummer Todd Glass. Together, the trio have formed their own band called Saint Cecilia, and they also released their own self-titled album in 2012.
Release information.
"Bend in the Road" was first released as a double vinyl LP in the US (limited to 2000 copies), with a CD release following on 28 August. The LP features a cover painted by Spencer himself, whereas the CD uses a photo. The tracklistings are also slightly different, with four tracks exclusive to the LP, and one exclusive to the CD.

SL Jones

Bryan Jones, better known by his stage name, SL Jones, is an American rapper and songwriter from Little Rock, Arkansas.
Early life.
SL Jones, birth name Bryan Jones, was born in Flint, Michigan and shortly after moved with his family to Little Rock, Arkansas, where he was raised in a neighborhood known as 23rd & Wolfe Street. The rapper has described his neighborhood as being in a gang-heavy part of the city, a collection of smaller Crip and Blood affiliated neighborhoods often referred to as the "War Zone." He regularly raps about and references his hometown and neighborhood, with the number 23, taken from the street's name, serving as a recurring theme in his music.
While growing up, SL Jones spent a brief time back in Flint, Michigan, where he was pursuing studies in visual arts, before ultimately moving to Atlanta to pursue a career in music. Upon beginning his career in music, the name SL Jones was selected with SL representing the words "Second Letter," as in the letter B (for Bryan), the second letter of the alphabet.
Grind Time Rap Gang.
SL Jones first gained awareness when he began working with Killer Mike, Pill, Nario, Big Slimm, Da Bill Collector, and others as a part of Grind Time Official, also referred to as Grind Time Rap Gang. While working closely with Grind Time, SL Jones appeared on a number of mixtapes and official retail albums, including I Pledge Allegiance To The Grind, Underground Atlanta (album), and more.
Solo career.
In 2009, SL Jones released his first solo mixtape "C.O.L.O.R.S.: Bangin' On Wax". The mixtape included features from Killer Mike, Trae Tha Truth, Clipse, Chamillionaire, and more. Upon release, the project earned SL Jones accolades from a variety of press outlets, including Complex Magazine, which named SL Jones as one of The 10 Most Underrated New Rappers, writing, "With an analytical Mind and lyrical dexterity to go with impeccable flows and harmonies, Jones brings a complexity that's rare for both Southern and gang-affiliated rap."
In 2011, SL Jones released four projects:
On May 23, SL Jones released the Don Cannon-hosted mixtape The Number 23, a project which included features from Killer Mike, Pill, Trae Tha Truth, Waka Flocka Flame, and Yo Gotti, along with production from various producers, most notably: Lex Luger, Shawty Redd, Don Cannon, and Smiff & Cash. The mixtape received positive feedback, with "XXL Magazine" awarding the project an L-rated review, while Atlanta's leading alternative weekly, "Creative Loafing" gave the project a 4/5.
On August 23, "The Number 23" was re-released in a slimmed down, non-DJ format titled ""'The Number 23: Editor's Cut. This version, a total of 16 songs, included two new tracks: "Out Here," which features Rocko and JBar, and "Michael Jordan," produced by Lex Luger.
On September 14, SL Jones released Pandamonium""', a project that remixed Clams Casino's "Rainforest" EP. The project contained five tracks.
On December 14, SL Jones released his mixtape, Flight Risk. The 10-track project, includes production by several producers, notably: Sonny Digital, Young L, Lex Luger, and Shawty Redd. XXL writes, "...the tape is another dosage of quality material from SL. Streets approved, no questions."
To start 2012, SL Jones announced his intention to release a series of EP projects; instead he began working to complete a 12-track mixtape with Atlanta producer DJ Burn One for the first five months of the year. In February 2012, SL Jones announced the collaborative project, titled Paraphernalia. In concert with the announcement, SL Jones released “Wave Runner,” a song produced by DJ Burn One that ultimately was not included on the mixtape. On May 23, SL Jones released "Paraphernalia", which includes features from rappers Freddie Gibbs and Rittz and singer Ebony Love.
Critical response to "Paraphernalia" was positive. Complex Magazine hailed the mixtape as "an expertly crafted piece of Southern-fried hip-hop." FADER Magazine wrote, "Paraphernalia boasts variety, songcraft and attention to detail, a tough trifecta to find." RCRD LBL wrote, "Paraphernalia is like spending the day at a barbecue. There's soulful lyricism and the sort of stoned throwback organic funk at which Burn One excels." The Smoking Section wrote, "My best advice is not to sleep on Paraphernalia."
To start 2013, SL Jones announced a new EP, "Trapper's Delight", produced by M16 and hosted by Hoodrich and Grand Hustle DJ, MLK. The EP was seven songs and again earned strong marks from outlets like Complex, XXL, and others. In April, SL Jones went out on his first headline tour, The Way Of Life No Hobby Tour, to support "Trapper's Delight" and prepare for his new mixtape. The nine-city tour made stops in states including Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas.
In August 2013, SL jones announced a new mixtape, Way Of Life No Hobby, hosted by popular mixtape DJ and record executive Don Cannon. The mixtape was preceded by three singles, "Big Bank (No Ones)", "America's Nightmare", and "Don't Want Nan". Like "Trapper's Delight" and "Paraphernalia", SL Jones collaborated exclusively with one producer, Metro Boomin, for "Way Of Life No Hobby". The mixtape was released on September 4, 2013, via popular mixtape website LiveMixtapes and includes features from Killer Mike, Kevin Gates, Starlito, Trouble, Mibbs of the rap group Pac Div, and others.

Eric Slater

" This article is about the artist and print maker. He is not to be confused with another Eric Slater who designed ceramics in the 1930s."
Eric Brindley Slater (1896 - 13 Mar 1963) was an English print maker.
Biography.
Eric Slater was a colour woodcut artist who had an international reputation in the 1920s and 1930s. The son of a silversmith, he was born in Hampstead, London. When he was eight, his father died and he moved with his mother to East Sussex, first to Bexhill-on-Sea, then to Winchelsea, and finally, in 1929, to Seaford. He attended the Hastings School of Art.
Notable for their beautifully observed skies, many of Slater's prints are inspired by the South Downs and the coastline near his home. His printmaking was revered during his relatively short career, and much admired by Campbell Dodgson, then Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum. Slater was a member of the Society of Graver Printers in Colour and the Society of Print Makers of California. His work was exhibited in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Austria and South Africa, but he stopped making woodcuts soon after the death of his mother in 1938. 
By the time Slater died in 1963, he had sunk into obscurity. With no close surviving relatives, he was buried in a shared grave in Seaford. An exhibition of his landscapes was held at the Towner Gallery in Eastbourne, East Sussex, in 2012 - the first public display of his work for 70 years. Exhibitions in Seaford and Lewes followed in 2013, that year being the 50th anniversary of Slater's death.
Slater's prints are held by the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, and can also be found in national museums in Canada and New Zealand. The Towner exhibition helped revive interest in his work and the output of other British artists who used Japanese techniques to make colour woodcuts - a printing method introduced to the UK by Frank Morley Fletcher (1866-1949) in the 1890s. A book about Slater by James Trollope, called Slater's Sussex, has been published by Towner.

Artur Alberto de Campos Henriques, GCTE GCC (Porto, 28 April 1853 – Lisbon, 7 November 1922) was a Portuguese politician who once served as Prime Minister of Portugal.
Biography.
Campos Henriques was of Jewish ancestry. His brother was the first Viscount of Vila Nova da Foz Côa and his maternal uncle was the second Viscount of Lagoaça, Júlio César de Castro Pereira. He served as a member of Parliament, and was the Prefect ("Governador Civil") of Porto from 1891 to 1894 (interim 1891 to 1893). He became Minister for Public Works in 1894. From 26 December 1908 to 11 April 1909, he served as the President of the Council of Ministers (today Prime Minister) in a nonpartisan administration created on the initiative of King Manuel II. 
Campos Henriques was close to the conservative wing of the Regenerator Party, but was ultimately without formal party affiliation. From 25 June 1900 to 20 October 1904 and from 20 March to 19 May 1906 he served as Minister for Justice during the second and third administrations of Ernesto Hintze Ribeiro. 
He served once again as Minister for Justice in the Francisco Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral administration, from 4 February to 25 December 1908, after which he became President of the Council of Ministers, on Ferreira do Amaral's loss of parliamentary support.
Campos Henriques was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword.

<doc id="36580619" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36580619" title="Evacuation of the La Romana Division">
Evacuation of the La Romana Division

The Evacuation of the La Romana Division in August 1808 was a military operation in which a division of troops belonging to the Kingdom of Spain and commanded by Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana defected from the armies of the First French Empire. The Spanish troops were part of the Imperial forces in Denmark, which were under the leadership of Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte. Most of the Spanish troops were successfully spirited away by the British navy and shipped to Santander, Spain to fight against France in the Peninsular War.
In 1807, the Spanish Division of the North was sent to northern Europe to fight in the War of the Fourth Coalition. Formerly loyal to the alliance with Imperial France, the Spanish officers and men found in 1808 that Emperor Napoleon I of France had overthrown King Charles IV of Spain and Prince Ferdinand and placed his brother Joseph Bonaparte on the Spanish throne. The British sent an agent to contact La Romana and found that the general desired to escape from Denmark. The two arranged a secret plan for the Spanish troops to be evacuated by the British fleet. One cavalry and two infantry regiments failed to get away and remained in Napoleon's power. But in August 1808, most units were able to seize Danish shipping and make their way to the rendezvous with the British navy. About 9,000 Spanish troops disembarked at Santander in October 1808 and had a chance to fight against the French.
Division of the North.
In 1806, Spain was an ally of Emperor Napoleon's First French Empire. After all, it was the combined fleets of France and Spain that were defeated by the British at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. At this time, Manuel de Godoy, Prince of the Peace was a favorite of King Charles IV of Spain, enjoying great influence. At the start of the War of the Fourth Coalition, which pitted the Kingdom of Prussia against Napoleon, Godoy issued a proclamation that was obviously aimed at France, even though it did not specify an enemy. After Napoleon's decisive victory at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, Godoy quickly withdrew the proclamation. But it was too late to avert the emperor's suspicion. From that moment, Napoleon planned to deal with his inconstant ally at some future time. In the meantime, the French emperor dragooned Godoy and Charles IV into providing a division of Spanish troops to serve in northern Europe. 
In March 1807, 15,000 Spanish troops set out for northern Europe under the command of Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana. Altogether, there were 14 battalions of foot soldiers and five regiments of horse. Their first destination was Hamburg. La Romana's Division served under Marshal Guillaume Brune at the Siege of Stralsund which ended on 20 August 1807 when the Swedish garrison evacuated the city. Brune commanded 40,000 troops from France, the Kingdom of Holland, the Kingdom of Italy, the Grand Duchy of Baden, and some lesser German states. The Spanish contingent included 9,763 infantry, 2,340 cavalry in 12 squadrons, 324 gunners in four foot artillery batteries, and 104 sappers. The besiegers lost 998 men killed, wounded, missing, or died from disease. Spanish casualties are unknown. 
The Division of the North spent the winter of 1807–1808 in Swedish Pomerania, Mecklenburg, and towns of the old Hanseatic League. In early 1808, the Spanish troops marched into Denmark. According to an 1808 state of the army, the line infantry regiments each had three battalions of four companies and their strengths were, "Asturias" (2,103), "Guadalajara" (2,069), "Princesa" (1,969), and "Zamora" (2,096). The light infantry regiments each consisted of one battalion of six companies and their numbers were, "1st of Barcelona" (1,266) and "1st of Catalonia" (1,164). The heavy cavalry regiments each counted five squadrons and their strengths were, "Rey" Nr. 1 (634), "Infante" Nr. 4 (615), and "Algarve" Nr. 9 (572). The Light Cavalry also had five squadrons and their numbers were, "Almanza" Nr. 3 (598) and "Villaviciosa" Nr. 5 (628). 
The Division of the North came under the command of Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte who was tasked with defending the southwestern shore of the Baltic Sea. In addition to La Romana's Spaniards, the marshal controlled 30,000 Danish troops plus French and Dutch units. Napoleon, whose plans to seize Spain were well advanced, made sure that the Spanish units were spread out so that it would be difficult to assemble them in one place. Furthermore, Danish troops were always posted nearby. 
The 4,000 men of the "Asturias" and "Guadalajara" Regiments were stationed near Roskilde on the island of Zealand (Sjælland). The 4,500-strong "Princesa", "1st of Barcelona", "Almanza", and "Villaviciosa" Regiments were posted on the island of Funen (Fyn) along with La Romana's headquarters which were at Nyborg. The "1st of Catalonia" Regiment was quartered on Langeland. The "Algarve", "Infante", "Rey", and "Zamora" Regiments were stationed at Aarhus (Århus), Fredericia, and Randers on Jutland. Watching the various Spanish contingents were the main Danish army on Zealand, 3,000 Danes at Odense on Funen, 800 Danes and a company of French on Langeland, and a Dutch light cavalry brigade and Danish infantry on Jutland. To keep the soldiers quiet, Napoleon increased the officers' pay and promised La Romana the Grand Cross of the Légion d'Honneur. In order to flatter the Spaniards, Bernadotte used a troop of the "Rey" Regiment as his personal escort.
During the spring, the French authorities began intercepting the dispatches between La Romana and the Spanish government. However, they failed to stop a Spanish officer who arrived in April with a message protesting that 15 messages had been sent from Spain without a reply from the Division of the North. At last, La Romana and his officers became aware of the French seizure of Barcelona, Figueras, and Pamplona in March. Soon afterward came the tidings of the Dos de Mayo Uprising. Nearly all of the officers and men were infuriated by the news but realized that they were encompassed by enemies and far from home. On 24 June, La Romana learned that Joseph Bonaparte had been proclaimed king. One of his staff officers, Joseph O'Donnell noted, "The more they tried to persuade us that Spain was tranquil, and had settled down to enjoy an age of felicity under Napoleon, the more clearly did we forsee the scenes of blood, strife, and disaster which were to follow these incredible events."
Spy.
After the outbreak of the Peninsular War, the British government desired to get in touch with the Division of the North to see whether its soldiers wished to fight against Napoleon. An authority consulted Francisco Javier Castaños, who assured him that the troops would do so. Since the British navy totally dominated the Baltic Sea it was feasible to pick up the Spaniards if only they could reach the coast. First, an agent had to brave Napoleon's secret police in order to get in touch with La Romana. Luckily, Sir Arthur Wellesley had suggested such a person to British Foreign Secretary George Canning before departing to command the army in Portugal that went on to win the Battle of Vimeiro in August 1808. 
James Robertson was a Roman Catholic priest who was born in Scotland but spent much of his life in a monastery in Regensberg, Germany. He went to England where he took employment as a tutor to an aristocratic family. While there, he let Wellesley know that he was willing to serve the British government in its struggle against Napoleon's empire. Canning contacted Robertson who accepted the mission to get in touch with La Romana. The spy was introduced into Europe via a smuggling ship that passed from Heligoland to Bremerhaven. Finding that the Spaniards were no longer in the vicinity of the Hanseatic towns, Robertson traveled north into Denmark, posing as a German merchant of chocolate and cigars, which were contraband goods. 
Robertson made his way to Nyborg and introduced himself to La Romana with his chocolate and cigars, which he knew were especially desired by the Spanish officers. But as soon as he and the Spanish general were in private, he blurted out his mission. He knew it was possible that La Romana might turn him over to Napoleon's police to be hanged as a spy. At first, the Spaniard regarded Robertson as a likely French agent trying to test his loyalty. Finally, the priest convinced La Romana that he was working for the British government. The general admitted that he was dismayed by his position and certain that Napoleon's intentions toward Spain were bad. 
The Scottish priest then revealed the plan for the British navy to evacuate the Division of the North from Denmark and land it at any location in the Spanish empire that La Romana wanted to go. After talking it over with his staff, the Spanish general told Robertson of his desire to go ahead with the operation. Soon afterward, the plan nearly miscarried when the Scot was picked up by a Danish patrol while attempting to signal a British warship off Funen. The priest managed to talk his way out of the situation and later was able to get his message to a British vessel. At length, the commander of the Baltic fleet, Admiral Richard Goodwin Keats contacted Canning that the plan could be put into motion. Transport vessels set out from England for the Baltic.
Plans and escape.
La Romana let a few trusted subordinates into the secret. However, the plan was not confided to the pro-French Brigadier General Jean de Kindelan on Jutland. In order for the evacuation to be a success, La Romana needed to concentrate his scattered troops and seize the nearby ports when the British fleet was close by. The initial strategy was to assemble all the Spanish troops in one place for a grand review for Marshal Bernadotte. This plot was not carried out because orders arrived from France that all Spanish soldiers were required to swear an oath of loyalty to King Joseph Bonaparte. The troops on Jutland and Funen took the oath, their officers ignoring it when the soldiers swore allegiance to Prince Ferdinand rather than to Joseph. However, on Zealand there was a full scale mutiny on 31 July in which an aide de camp to General François Nicolas Fririon was killed. The next day, the "Asturias" and "Guadalajara" Regiments were surrounded by superior numbers of Danish troops and compelled to surrender. Thereafter, the soldiers were interned in small groups. 
This incident alarmed Bernadotte, but before he could take stronger measures, the news reached La Romana that Rafael Lobo, an agent of the Spanish Junta had arrived offshore. Lobo indicated that the British fleet was en route, so the Spanish general got the word to his subordinates that it was time to execute the plan. The Spanish troops on Funen seized the port of Nyborg on 7 August. The only resistance was from two Danish vessels in the harbour - the brig Fama and the smaller Søe-Ormen - which were attacked by a British frigate and overwhelmed. The next day, the soldiers on Jutland commandeered some small craft at Fredericia and Aarhus and sailed to Funen. The "Infante", "Rey", and "Zamora" Regiments made a clean getaway, but the colonel of the "Algarve" regiment refused to budge. Finally, the senior captain put the plan into motion but it was too late. Finally aware of the plot, Kindelan rode to a nearby French camp and told them what was going on. A brigade of Dutch hussars intercepted the "Algarve" Regiment and forced their surrender; the senior captain then killed himself. Those troops who did not escape were eventually formed into the Joseph Napoleon's Regiment in the service of France.
By this time La Romana had 8,000 Spanish soldiers assembled on Funen. The badly outnumbered Danish contingent at Odense prudently left them alone. Between 9 and 11 August, the troops on Funen sailed across to Langeland where the "1st of Catalonia" had overcome the Danish garrison. La Romana's 9,000 Spanish troops waited on Langeland until 21 August when Keats arrived with three ships of the line and other warships. Keats transshipped the Division of the North to Gothenburg, Sweden where 37 naval transports awaited them. The squadron sailed to Santander where they deposited La Romana's troops by 11 October. The foot soldiers immediately prepared to fight while the cavalrymen marched to Extremadura where they were to collect horses.
Postscript.
When the troops arrived at Santander, La Romana formed the infantry into the 5th Division of the "Army of Galicia" and placed the Conde de San Roman in command. The division was ordered to join Joaquín Blake's army but only the "1st of Catalonia" with 1,066 men arrived in time to participate in the Battle of Pancorbo on 29 October 1808. The 5th Division formed the army's rear guard during the subsequent retreat. The French pursuit was so aggressive that San Roman reported to his army commander that he was about to be cut off, so Blake offered battle on 10 November. In the two-day Battle of Espinosa de los Monteros the 5,294-strong division repulsed several French attacks on the first day and suffered about 1,000 casualties including San Roman. A month later, the 5th Division still counted 3,953 bayonets.
The soldiers from the regiments that failed to escape Napoleon's clutches were employed in the French invasion of Russia and fought at the Battle of Borodino on 7 September 1812. The 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the "Joseph Napoleon" Regiment formed part of Louis Friant's 2nd Division of the I Corps while the 1st and 4th Battalions fought with Jean-Baptiste Broussier's 14th Division of the IV Corps. As many as 4,000 Spaniards were captured during the retreat from Russia and were handed over to the British Royal Navy at Kronstadt for repatriation to Spain.

Royal Nova Scotia Volunteer Regiment

"Not to be confused with the Royal Nova Scotia Regiment"
The Royal Regiment of Nova Scotia Volunteers was a Loyalist battalion of infantry raised in 1775 to defend British interests in the colony of Nova Scotia. The unit was commanded by Col. Francis Legge until replaced by Col. John Parr in 1782. The Royal NS Volunteers had an undistinguished history through most of its existence, and never saw combat, but did play an important role in the defense of the colony of Nova Scotia in the later years of the American Revolution.
Formation.
Francis Legge was appointed as the royal governor of Nova Scotia in 1773, just as troubles were brewing in the American colonies. Legge, "an earnest but highly prejudiced and therefore much disliked man" proposed to the Secretary of State on July 31, 1775 that he be permitted to raise a regiment of 1,000 men, to be recruited from the German, neutral and Irish settlers in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Legge had grave doubts about the loyalty of the New England Planters who made up the majority of Nova Scotia's settlers at this point. (Legge's distrust was not entirely misplaced, as the Eddy Rebellion was to prove.) He proposed the name "Royal Nova Scotia Volunteers", but this was denied and changed to "Loyal". Some time around 1780 the "Royal" designation was bestowed for the duration of the war.
Legge received a despatch from London, dated October 16, authorizing him to raise the regiment as a Fencible unit, for local defense only. The men were to be paid and equipped like regular soldiers; they would be, in effect, a full-time home guard.
The officers of the Regiment were mostly lawyers and other men of the Halifax establishment and Legge's political hangers-on, with little or no military experience, along with a number of subalterns brought in from the Fleet. The most distinguished senior officer was George Henry Monk, who became major and served for the duration.
Recruiting proved to be extremely difficult, owing to Legge's unpopularity. He was finally ordered back to Britain in May, 1776, although he remained colonel and governor "in absentia" until replaced by John Parr in 1782. Despite a recruiting bounty of two guineas, by April, 1776 only sixty men had been mustered, at very heavy expense. The officers were so discouraged that they sent a petition of grievances to the Secretary of State on June 14. Rather than being trained as soldiers, the men were sent to Spanish River, Cape Breton to dig coal for the army. The next summer, forty men went back to colliery while twenty served as marines on the Royal Navy sloop HMS Gage. The subalterns were returned to the Fleet.
Service.
As resentment of Legge died away, the fortunes of the Regiment changed. Returns show that by February, 1780, 568 men had enlisted, 92 deserted, for an overall strength of 476 rank and file. This was very close to the re-authorized strength of a half-battalion (500). Due to officer absences, the unit was under day-to-day command of the senior captain, John Solomon, at Fort Sackville. The Volunteers were taking a full share of garrison duties in Halifax and several outposts. Given the importance of Halifax to the overall British war effort, this was useful employment. In 1782 a detachment was sent to the Island of St. John.
Not only the size, but the reputation of the Regiment grew in these later years. A few months before disbandment, Brigadier-General Henry Edward Fox expressed:
...the great satisfaction he has received in seeing the two provincial battalions of Royal N.S. Volunteers and the King's Orange Rangers, and highly approves of their discipline and military appearance, more particularly of the soldierlike manoeuvres and quick-step of the Royal N. Sco. Volunteers which has so much the appearance of troops that have been employed in active service.
The Royal Nova Scotia Volunteer Regiment was disbanded at noon on Mon., October 20, 1783. The officers went on half-pay, and those officers and men who wished received land grants in the area of Ship Harbour. Cpt. Thomas Green, two sergeants, five corporals, and 22 private soldiers, some with their families, took up grants ranging from 100 to 450 acres.
Uniforms.
In 1775-76, the men of the Volunteers mostly wore civilian clothing, essentially, whatever they were wearing when enlisted. Their first uniforms arrived in early 1777, green coats faced white, with white smallclothes, in common with most other Loyalist corps of the American command at that time. Officers wore silver lace. By 1779 the regiment was wearing red coats faced buff, and officers' metal had changed to gold. There is a reference to red coats faced green in 1783.

John Mucknell

John Mucknell (born 1608, Stepney, London) was an English pirate in the 17th century. A staunch Royalist, he was knighted and appointed as a Vice Admiral by the future Charles II, and licensed as a privateer.
Biography.
Mucknell was born to Catholic parents in Stepney, in the East End of London, and baptised at St Dunstan's Church in September 1608. He and his wife Elizabeth later lived in the neighbouring parish of Poplar.
Mucknell became a ship's commander under the East India Company, a powerful firm trading between England and the East Indies. By 1643, Mucknell was unhappy with Puritan opinions and set sail on the "John", a new East India Company 44-gun ship, bound for 
Surat. After marooning his enemies on a small island called Johanna, among the Comoros in the north end of the Mozambique Channel, Mucknell sailed first to Bristol and then to the Isles of Scilly.
There, Mucknell united and took control of local pirates and the "John" became the flagship. There were about 11 ships in the group. Mucknell operated in the English Channel and the Western Approaches between 1644 and 1651.
Legacy.
There are three extant first hand accounts from crew members of the "John".
Todd Stevens, a shipwreck hunter, claims to have found the wreck of the "John". English Heritage announced plans to dive the wreck in June 2012.
Stevens has written a book on the subject of Mucknell, "The Pirate John Mucknell and the Hunt for the Wreck of the John".

Wyman Dam is a hydroelectric dam in Somerset County, Maine.
The dam was built in 1930 and connects the southwest corner of the town of Moscow with the southeast corner of Pleasant Ridge Plantation. Owned and operated by NextEra Energy, one of six of their hydroelectric facilities on the Kennebec River, it's named in honor of Walter Wyman, the president of the original builder Central Maine Power Company. The dam is partly earthen and partly concrete, with a height of 155 feet and 3054 feet long at its crest. The dam's power plant houses three 24 MW turbine generators.
Wyman Lake, the riverine reservoir formed by the dam, contains 194,016 acre-feet, among the largest lakes in Maine. Its normal surface area is over five square miles. It stretches northward from the dam, and forms the border between not only Moscow and Pleasant Ridge Plantation, but also between the town of Caratunk and Northwest Somerset.

The song has been subject to various interpretations. Of particular popularity are the mixes by Larry Levan. Cover versions have included one by the Celestial Choir in 2003.
Keedz version.
The biggest commercial success of the song has been by the French musical project "Keedz" that recorded it in 2008 and was the title track of their similarly titled album "Stand on the Word". The revamped electronic production of the soul and funk song remixed by MiMa made up of Michael Tordjman and Maxime Desprez did not enter the French charts in its initial release in 2008. But it proved to be very popular after Keedz' version of "Stand on the Word" was used as a short introduction to "Le Grand Journal" broadcast on Canal+ for the week 29 September to 3 October 2008. The French "Le Grand Journal" picks weekly one particular song (called "coming next") as a jingle to its introduction and changes it on a weekly basis. The choices prove usually to be future hits. The Keedz version of the song was also used in 2008 in an episode of the Australian television series "Underbelly".
The single was re-released a second time around in 2011. The single has been in the SNEP French Singles Chart since October 2011 totalling 28 weeks until end of July 2012 and reaching its peak position at #12 on chart dated 23 June 2012. The Keedz release was accompanied by a music video which became equally popular.

2012 Olympics.
Djibou Issaka, a gardener and swimming pool attendant, was chosen by Niger to train as a sculler just three months prior to the 2012 Summer Olympic games, receiving his first training in competitive rowing in Egypt, then spending two months at the International Rowing Development Centre in Tunisia. He was chosen for a wild card from the IOC Tripartite Commission, adding him to the full pool of otherwise qualified rowers, in a program that seeks to develop sports outside traditional competitors. In the 12 weeks prior to the Olympics he was named Nigerien national rowing champion. He trained in the Belgian town of Hazewinkel, prior to the opening of the games.
On 28 July, Djibo Issaka gained widespread press attention for his first Olympic appearance in the 2000 metre single sculls heat, in which he finished last with a time of 8:25.56, almost a minute behind his nearest competitor and almost 1 minute 40 seconds behind the winner.
The British press gave Djibo Issaka a wave of attention following his first appearance on 28 July, comparing him with Equiguinean swimmer Eric "the Eel" Moussambani from the Sydney games in 2000, and giving Djibo Issaka headline nicknames of "Issaka the Otter", "Hamadou The Keel," and the "Sculling Sloth". 
While crowds and the press cheered him, British former Olympic Gold Medal rower Steve Redgrave criticised Djibo Issaka's inclusion. Despite these comments, the IOC explained Djibo Issaka had not taken the place of any other qualified rower, but was one of a number of Olympians added to additional places created after qualification.
Djibo Issaka finished 4th (last) with a time of 8:39.66 in a second Repechage placement heat for non-qualifiers on 29 July.
On 31 July, Djibo Issaka started in the Semifinal E and finished 4th with a time of 9:07.99.

Northern Access Network

Northern Access Network was a Canadian unlicensed television system which broadcast taped programming to remote Canadian communities in the late 1970s.
History.
David Brough (born ) was a special education teacher at an institution for the mentally challenged and an entertainer for the Toronto-based "Uncle Bobby" children's TV series. In 1969 Brough travelled throughout remote northern Canada as a solo performer. During these tours he noted the lack of radio and television service in many regions and developed methods to bring television to remote Canadian communities. In 1971, Brough created a prototype television program in Yellowknife using portable videotape technology and demonstrated this to the CBC's board of directors. When the CBC rejected his proposals for extending television service.
Brough then developed an inexpensive television system which could be installed in remote communities. The station depended on taped programming which would be shipped to the station, rather than on microwave or satellite transmissions. A camera was available at the station for local broadcasts. Brough installed the first Northern Access Network station at Pickle Lake, Ontario in December 1976 with support by Umex, the operator of a local mine. Operating costs of recording and shipping programming tapes were covered with subscriber fees through a locally-run trust fund.
The television channel was not licensed by the federal broadcast regulatorCanadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). When police attempted to confiscate the station equipment local miners defended the equipment.
A Northern Access Network station was opened at Longlac, Ontario in 1977. French programming was included on that station to support the predominantly francophone community. Previously, only the CBC English network television service was available there. On 2 February 1978, the Longlac transmitter was seized by RCMP and Ontario Provincial Police officers accompanied by a representative from the federal Department of Communications. 
In May 1977, the CRTC and the Department of Communications indicated that they would demonstrate some tolerance to the unlicensed Northern Access Network stations. They adopted an approach where further attempts at station closures were unlikely, particularly where television service was otherwise unavailable.
Brough applied to the CRTC to formally license his stations. A hearing for that application was conducted that October. The CRTC awarded licences for five of his northern Ontario stations in late 1979, but rejected licences for many other existing stations. Brough's dilemma was that the smaller licensed stations would not be viable without income support from the unlicensed stations in more populous communities. 
The Northern Access Network grew from 30 stations in its first year to 50 by 1979. There were plans for up to 100 additional stations at that point.
By 1981, Brough turned his attention to the development of satellite television receive-only systems. He began Commander Satellite Systems that year.
Equipment.
A typical Northern Access Network station consisted of a tower with a low power transmitter. The programming signal originated from either a local video camera or a Betamax videocassette recorder. Brough recorded television programming in Toronto onto Betamax tapes which he then sent to the stations for broadcast.
For example, the initial Pickle Lake station featured a tower of supported by a one watt transmitter to provide an approximately coverage area. Total equipment cost at Pickle Lake was approximately $4000.
Brough modified the Betamax cassette system so that it could contain 10 hours of programming which reduced shipping costs. In the late 1970s, each modified cassette cost Brough $30 compared to the $47 cost of each conventional Betamax cassette.
Later, an inexpensive television encryption was developed for approximately $8 per descrambling unit. This allowed Northern Access Network to enforce a subscriber fee system in its communities.
Coverage.
Ontario communities served by Northern Access Network besides Pickle Lake and Loglac included Armstrong, Balmertown, Caramat, Cochenour, Dubreuilville, Ear Falls, Ignace, Mattabi Mines, Moosonee, Nakina, Sioux Lookout, South Bay Mine, Wawa
In early 1978, Manitoba stations were established at Gillam, Leaf Rapids and Lynn Lake, where the only existing television at the time was from CBC.
Other stations were established in the Northwest Territories (Inuvik, Tuktoyaktuk) and in Newfoundland (St Anthony)

2012 North Korean floods

The 2012 North Korean floods began in mid-July 2012 when Tropical Storm Khanun affected parts of the country, killing at least 88 people and leaving more than 62,000 people homeless. Torrential rains on 29 and 30 July 2012 worsened the situation, causing additional damage and casualties and forcing the government to request international assistance. Severe rainfall also affected the southern region of North Korea in August, killing at least six.
Tropical Storm Khanun.
Khanun made landfall in South Korea on 19 July and weakened as it moved over North Korea before dissipating over China. The government on 29 July increased the number of fatalities as a result of flooding caused by Khanun from 8 to 88, with an additional 134 injured. The biggest loss of human life was in two counties of South Pyongan province. At least 62,900 were made homeless by the flooding, while more than 30,000 hectares of land for growing crops were submerged and will add to growing fears of another looming famine in the country. Three hundred public buildings and 60 factories were damaged during the storm.
July 29-30 rains.
Torrential rains hit North Korea again on 29 and 30 July, with approximately 442 millimeters (17.4 inches) of rain recorded in Pakchon County of North Phyongan Province during a 24-hour period from 6 a.m. local time 29 July. The rains worsened the flood situation caused by Khanun, destroying railways, roads, bridges and 'many' dwelling houses. The government said many residents in the affected region were left homeless, but no figures have yet been released about damage and casualties. 
The North Korean government has asked assistance from resident United Nations agencies, the Red Cross, and European Union Program Support Units. The North Korean government also supported two inter-agency assessment missions in South Pyongan and Kangwon provinces on 31 July.
On 1 August, KCNA announced that North and South Pyongan provinces and Nyongwon county were severely affected by floods, landslides and thunderbolts, which destroyed 4,900 dwellings, submerged 8,530 homes and destroyed or submerged 200 public buildings and factories. KCNA also reported significant damage to coal mining and processing infrastructure in the area. Some 179,000 tonnes of coal were washed away, along with about 200 pieces of equipment at the Kaechon and Tokchon mining complexes. Railways serving the complexes were also damaged. State media reported at least 31 were killed by landslides and lightning, with 16 others missing.
On 4 August, the North Korean government said the death toll from both Khanun and the torrential rains in late July had risen to 169, with around 400 others missing. It said 8,600 houses were destroyed and 44,000 houses were flooded, leaving more than 212,200 people homeless.
17–20 August rains.
Torrential rains hit North Korea again between late 17 August and early 20 August, causing at least six deaths and destroying more than 530 buildings in the southern region of the country. Three people were killed in North Hwanghae Province, three people were also killed in South Phyongan Province, and an unknown number of people were killed in South Hwanghae Province.
Typhoon Bolaven.
In North Korea, heavy rains from the storm triggered significant flooding and many landslides in late August. In South Hamgyong Province, at least 100 homes were flooded by the storm. KCNA reported wind speeds of more than in North and South Hwanghae, South Hamgyong, South Pyongan and the city of Nampho, and waves as high as in the sea of Kimchaek. Widespread damage took place throughout the country as a result of the storm. At least 6,700 homes were destroyed and approximately 101,000 hectares (250,000 acres) of crop and rice fields were flooded. Additionally, 16,730 trees were downed and 880 public and industrial buildings were severely damaged. In all, at least 48 people were killed and 21,800 others were left homeless.
