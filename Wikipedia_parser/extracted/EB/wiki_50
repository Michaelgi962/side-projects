Waybury Inn

The Waybury Inn is an inn located in Middlebury, Vermont, United States in the Green Mountains region. The inn was built in 1810 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The inn maintains a tradition in which, in room 9, there is an antique desk with a secret drawer. Following the lead of a couple who found the drawer in 1987, guests often put notes in the drawer.
The Waybury Inn was also used as a location for exterior shots on the Bob Newhart television series, "Newhart", from 1982 to 1990. Featured as the Stratford Inn, the Waybury Inn was painted white for the show. After the show went off the air in 1990, the inn was repainted green to match the nearby Green Mountains.

Channel hookup

In theatrical productions, the channel hookup is a printout of a lighting database such as Lightwright that organizes all the lighting information for a stage show by the channel number associated with the lighting equipment and limits the information associated with a particular lighting instrument such that a designer or electrician can access needed information rapidly and efficiently.
Lighting equipment is often organized by lighting system thereby granting coherence to consecutive channel numbers. Channels 1 through 10 might be Frontlight while 21 through 30 could be Sidelight from left. In Repertory Opera and other large venues channel numbers are often granted to lighting equipment by position as the purpose of the light will change from show to show.
A Channel Hookup will commonly include Channel, Dimmer, Color, Template and Purpose information

Takht Singh

Takht Singh, GCSI(6 June 1819 – 13 February 1873) was first the regent (1839–1841) and the final Maharaja of Ahmednagar 1841–1843 as a result of an agreement with the British. Once he ceded Ahmednagar to Idar, he was recognized as Maharaja of Jodhpur (1843–1873).
He was born in Ahmednagar, the second son of Karan Singh and grandson of Sagram Singh, the Maharaja of Ahmednagar from 1798 to 1835. He had little prospect of ascending the throne, yet after the death of his brother, Prithi Singh in 1839, he became the regent over the whole state and served as such until the birth of his brother's son, Balwant Singh, who was proclaimed ruler at his birth. Takht Singh then became the new ruler's regent and served as such until the death of his nephew on 23 September 1841, when he became the Maharaja of Ahmednagar.
However,two years into his reign in 1843, Man Singh, the Maharaja of Jodhpur died. He was persuaded by his widows to take the succession (he was a member of the Rulers of Marwar (Jodhpur); The Rathore Dynasty through his grandfather, Sagram Singh. The son of Sagram Singh, a Maharaja of Idar, who himself was the son of Anand Singh, the first Maharaja of Idar and a younger son of Maharaja Ajit Singh, Raja of Jodhpur), however, he had to cede Ahmednagar back to the state of Idar to be recognized in Jodhpur by the British.
So, on 29 October 1843, he ascended the "gadi" at the Sringar Chowki in Mehrangarh. Later in his life, he served loyal service to British at the time of Indian Mutiny of 1857 and in 1862 he received a "sanad" of adoption . During his life he was a chronic womanizer.;He married 30 wives. He died in Jodhpur on 13 February 1873 and was cremated at Mandore. He was succeeded by his eldest son Jaswant Singh II in Jodhpur, while his third son, Pratap Singh would go on to become the Maharaja of Idar.His first-born daughter, "Kumari" Chand-Kanwar Bai-Lal, would be married to Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II, the Maharaja of Jaipur.

Stranger (Hilary Duff song)

"Stranger" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Hilary Duff for her fourth studio album, "Dignity" (2007). It was written by Duff, Kara DioGuardi, Vada Nobles, Derrick Haruin and Julius "Logic" Diaz and produced by Nobles, Haruin and Diaz.
Background and release.
In mid April 2007, in a post on Duff's blog, she told her fans that they could vote for what they thought should be the next single from "Dignity". According to a later post, fan feedback via votes was "overwhelmingly" in favor of "Stranger" as the next single. Duff promoted the song with a performance on "So You Think You Can Dance".
In mid-2007, concurrent to the preparation of the radio release of "Stranger", Duff was featured in a bikini on the July covers of the magazines "Us Weekly" and "Shape", and on the August cover of "Maxim" accompanied by the declaration that she had gone "from the queen of teen to breakout sex symbol". The Associated Press wrote that the first two were representative of "a clear move Duff's part to put her Lizzie McGuire past behind her", and that more provocative imaging of her would help her singles to garner mainstream radio play: "Ultimately, nature, time and genetics may help Duff in a way Disney, despite all its might, cannot." Guy Zapoleon, a radio consultant and former programmer for top 40 radio, said such imaging would "definitely have a positive effect on the attitude of programmers, who are mostly male, as Disney tries to mature her image".
The single was released to U.S. contemporary hit radio stations on July 10, 2007.
Composition.
The song was rumored to be about Duff and her relationship with her ex-boyfriend, Joel Madden; "Entertainment Weekly" wrote, "When the fairy-tale romance between and Madden went belly-up late last year.
According to Duff, the song is actually about how she thought her mother feels around her father, who had an extramarital affair with another woman. Duff said she wrote "Stranger" to appear to be about one of her own relationships, because she didn't want people to know about the strained relationship between her parents. "But I've realized that so many can relate to what I've gone through", she said. Another song on the album, "Gypsy Woman", was inspired by the same situation. Duff told "Access Hollywood" that writing the song "was like therapy, you know. Just a total release of all the things you hold inside".
Critical reception.
A writer for BBC Radio 1 gave the song three stars, commenting on how it "continues the more grown-up, serious side of Hilary Duff"; he called the vocals "definitely more in the ballpark of 'husky' rather than 'impressive'" and said the Eastern sound owed much to songs such as the Pussycat Dolls' "Buttons". Although he stated he would prefer "Danger", another song on "Dignity", to be a single, he said "Stranger" "sound out of place on a Britney Spears album, which suggests to me that she's done a passable job of leaving behind her bubblegum past", and that it made him "[do a fair bit of seat-dancing".
A review from Music Focus called the track "unashamedly pop" and said that it was "one of the strongest cuts from Duff's latest album and pushes her into a maturer pop sound". They gave the song a positive review, adding that "Stranger" "needto be a success" and was "cool, confident slice of dance pop and some of Duff's best work to date". Gary Lancaster of TeenSpot gave the song four stars, calling it an "example of how a modern pop anthem really should sound". He also called it "sleek and sophisticated" and a "catchy, chart worthy track". The song was well received by "Billboard" reviewer Chuck Taylor, who called it "uptempo" and "dance-friendly", but said that "Top 40 is a tough call".
"Blender" magazine included the song in the "Dangerously in Love" category on its year-end "Oh Yeah... 209 Songs We Like" list.
Chart performance.
But, due to the lack of promotion given to the song, it reached number ninety-seven on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot 100 to become Duff's lowest peaking song on the chart, on which it spent one week. The single received frequent airplay in U.S. nightclubs, peaking at number one on the "Billboard" Hot Dance Club Play chart—it was Duff's third entry on the chart, and her second consecutive number-one single. On the year-end Hot Dance Club Play Tracks chart, "Stranger" was ranked thirty-ninth. It reached number eighty-six on the Canadian Hot 100, and is included on the MuchMusic compilation album "MuchDance 2008".
The WaWa club mix of the song was premiered at the opening party of the Ibiza nightclub Space, which named it "Single of the Week" in its weekly podcast. The UK single release of "Stranger" was to be on July 9, according to FemaleFirst.co.uk, but it was moved back to August 20 to allow the remix to gain airplay in clubs, and then to September 3, when it received a download-only release. "Stranger" debuted at 102 on the UK Singles Chart. In Australia, the song was the third most-added to radio in the week ending October 24; it entered the Australian ARIA Singles Chart on November 12 at number sixty-eight on download sales alone. It subsequently left the chart, and re-entered at number forty-nine.
Music video.
The video for the single was directed by Fatima Robinson and was shot in Los Angeles, California, including at a mansion in Silver Lake, between May 10 and May 12, 2007. Duff said she was ill during the shoot, but that it went well because she liked the song and the director; she also said she thought it was her best music video to date. The video premiered on Yahoo! Music on May 30, 2007 and had its "First Look" on "Total Request Live" on June 6, 2007.
The video begins with Duff's character running out of her home to look for her romantic partner, who drives away. It cuts to her waking up and finding a letter and a bracelet, and then shows Duff watching a woman seducing her partner. At a dinner party, Duff's partner kisses her and then flirts with the other woman. The video cuts to a scene at a lounge where dancers entertain the guests, among whom are Duff's partner and two other men. Duff's partner flirts with one of the dancers. Recurring shots of Duff wearing a hooded jacket are edited into the video. The second verse begins with Duff belly dancing in a harem costume and wearing henna tattoos and beads; according to Duff, they took several hours to apply and reflected the "Indian type beat" in the song. During the second chorus, the dinner party scene is shown again. Duff is introduced to the other woman, and she talks to other guests. The chorus plays again with Duff walking into a nightclub and teasing her partner, before dancing with another man. She then breaks into another dance routine with two other dancers. The final two choruses show Duff and her partner fighting, and Duff looking at a cellphone before leaving the house with a suitcase.
Bill Lamb of About.com named it the week's "Friday Fun Video", writing "Visually, this is probably Hilary Duff's best video yet." "Blender" magazine wrote, "Her dancing skills are still a tad stilted but she makes up for it with some key "despondent" and "perturbed" acting faces", also noting what it described as "shameless close-ups of a certain cell phone". "The Sun" editorialized, "Nope this isn't the next big Bollywood star—it's Hilary Duff taking her image to a whole new level. The singer's reinvention from squeaky teen star to sexy pop starlet is obviously well underway [...] all well and good for Hilary—just as long as she doesn't do a Britney."

Castle Saunderson

Castle Saunderson is a castle near Belturbet, County Cavan, Ireland. It was the family seat of the Saunderson family, who acquired the original castle in 1573 during the Ulster plantation. The original castle was inhabited by the O'Reillys of Breffni and formerly known as Breffni Castle since the 14th century. The present castle dating from the 1840s. A notable member of the family born there was Edward Saunderson, founder of the Ulster Unionist Party. 
Captain Alexander Saunderson sold the Castle in 1977 to a businessman, who planned to use it as a residence, but this never transpired. It later served as a hotel, but was damaged by fire, the third fire to occur at the Castle. In 1997 it was acquired by Scouting Ireland (CSI). The subsequent formation of Scouting Ireland and financial difficulties had delayed its development as a cross-border Scout campsite, but substantial progress occurred with the announcement in November 2008 of EU funding for the project, amounting to over €3 million. 
Michael D Higgins, President of Ireland, opened the €3.7 million European-funded Castle Saunderson International Scouting Centre in Cavan on 18 August 2012. The President was joined by dignitaries from both sides of the Border, including Northern Ireland Executive Ministers Jonathan Bell, Nelson McCausland and Jennifer McCann and Minster of State in the Republic Fergus O’Dowd. 
The Saunderson Castle estate (currently only 103 acres) has an entrance in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. These grounds include a church and family grave yard.

Gallium halides

There are three sets of gallium halides, the trihalides where gallium has oxidation state +3, the intermediate halides containing gallium in oxidation states +1, +2 and +3 and some unstable monohalides, where gallium has oxidation state +1.
Trihalides.
All four trihalides are known. They all contain gallium in the +3 oxidation state. Their proper names are gallium(III) fluoride, gallium(III) chloride, gallium(III) bromide and gallium(III) iodide.
Intermediate halides.
Intermediate chlorides, bromides and iodides exist. They contain gallium in oxidation states +1, +2 and +3.
Monohalides.
None of the monohalides are stable at room temperature. The previously reported GaBr and GaI produced from fusing gallium with the trihalide have been shown to be mixtures of metallic gallium with, respectively, Ga2Br3 and Ga2I3.
Anionic halide complexes.
Salts containing GaCl4−, GaBr4− and GaI4− are all known. Gallium is very different from indium in that it is only known to form 6 coordinate complexes with the fluoride ion. This can be rationalised by the smaller size of gallium (ionic radii of Ga(III) 62 pm, In(III) 80 pm).
Salts containing the Ga2Cl62− anion, where gallium has an oxidation state of +2, are known.

Amo Bessone

Amo "Betts" Bessone (November 22, 1916 – January 9, 2010) was a collegiate ice hockey player and head coach.
Bessone was born in Sagamore, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod, and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, where he learned to play hockey.
As a hockey coach, Bessone is best remembered for winning a national championship as a heavy underdog in 1966 with the "Cinderella Spartans." He was one of the most colorful college coaches of his era with a trademark whistle he used to signal line changes.
As intense as Bessone was behind the bench, he was warm and endearing off the ice. During his coaching days, he regularly invited fellow coaches, officials and reporters out for drinks or back to his house for spaghetti following games.
Playing career.
High School.
Bessone played high school hockey in West Springfield, Massachusetts, and for two preparatory schools in Maine, Hebron Academy and Kents Hill School. Bessone also played hockey for Association Saint-Dominique, a Lewiston amateur team. During his days in Maine, he was described as cocky but one of the best defensemen in high school hockey. Bessone was graduated from Kents Hill in 1939.
College.
After prep school, he played college hockey from 1940-43 at the University of Illinois under legendary coach Vic Heyliger. He was team captain his senior season of 1942-43. In addition to hockey, Bessone earned letters in baseball and basketball.
Professional.
Following Illinois, Bessone played minor league hockey in the AHL for the Providence Reds. He made his professional debut with the Reds on March 16, 1943 in the first game of the opening round of the AHL playoffs against the Cleveland Barons. His career in the AHL was cut short by serving in World War II. Bessone also played for his hometown Springfield minor league baseball team of the Eastern League.
Coaching career.
Westfield.
Bessone was head ice hockey coach for Westfield High School for three seasons following his playing career.
Michigan Tech.
Bessone got his first collegiate head coaching job on September 13, 1948, when he was hired by Michigan College of Mines and Technology (now Michigan Technological University). He coached at Michigan Tech for three seasons compiling a record of 20-31-2.
Michigan State.
Following the 1951 season, Bessone accepted the head coaching position at Michigan State University after Harold Paulsen resigned. Bessone would remain at MSU for the next 28 years.
When Bessone arrived at Michigan State, the ice hockey program was just beginning its third season and its youth was evident with a 6-25 record over two seasons. The Spartans struggled with six losing seasons before Bessone turned things around in his seventh season as coach. In 1957-58, Michigan State enjoyed its first winning season. The following season, Bessone guided MSU to a Big Ten championship and a berth in the NCAA tournament. The Spartans lost the 1959 national championship game in overtime to North Dakota.
Following 1959, Michigan State became a charter member of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA), which was a reincarnation of the loosely affiliated Midwest Collegiate Hockey League and Western Intercollegiate Hockey League that disbanded following the 1957-58 season. Bessone and MSU struggled during the first five seasons of the WCHA.
Again, Bessone turned things around with a winning season in 1964-65. The following season, Bessone coached Michigan State to an improbable NCAA National Championship.
MSU began the 1965-66 season 4-10, but rebounded winning 12 of their last 15 games including both WCHA playoff games which earned MSU a spot in the NCAA tournament. In the national semifinals, Bessone squeaked out a 2-1 victory over highly favored Boston University. In the national championship game, Bessone and the Spartans faced Len Ceglarski's Clarkson team that owned the national-best record of 24-2. Michigan State shocked Clarkson with a dominant 6-1 victory sealing MSU's first national championship. Len Ceglarski and Bessone shared the Spencer Penrose Award as the national coach of the year in 1966. The national title and coaching award cemented Bessone's legacy as a coach. To this day, Bessone's 1966 Michigan State team remains one of the biggest underdog stories in NCAA ice hockey history. The total number of team victories (16) and team winning percentage (.551) is the lowest of any NCAA ice hockey champion. MSU made the NCAA tournament again with a strong WCHA playoff finish in 1967, but lost in the national semifinals.
Bessone began the 1970s with six straight winning seasons. As MSU hockey was building momentum, the 7,000-seat Munn Ice Arena was opened in 1974 just south of the old ice rink, Dem Hall. The peak of the momentum came in 1975-76 when Bessone guided MSU to its best WCHA conference finish. Michigan State was on the verge of earning an NCAA tournament berth when Minnesota knocked MSU out of the WCHA playoffs in triple overtime. Minnesota, who had finished below Michigan State in the conference, received an NCAA tournament bid instead.
The loss proved devastating to Bessone and the MSU hockey program. The Spartans suffered three straight losing seasons following 1976.
Bessone announced his retirement effective at the end of the 1978-79 season. He finished his coaching career with a 5-3 victory over archrival Michigan completing the weekend series sweep of the Wolverines. His success at Michigan State helped form a loyal group of MSU hockey supporters dubbed "Amo's Army." Bessone holds a 387-458-22 career record in 31 seasons.
Legacy.
Bessone's legacy extends beyond his accomplishments at Michigan State. Bessone helped establish the Greater Lansing Area Hockey Association (GLAHA), the first organized youth hockey program in Mid-Michigan. He assisted the league by donating used equipment and encouraging his players to volunteer as coaches. GLAHA started with three players in 1953 and by Bessone's retirement from coaching in 1979, the organization boasted 450 players. GLAHA alumni include current and former NHL players: Jeff Brubaker, Danton Cole, Kelly Miller, Kevin Miller, Kip Miller, Ryan Miller and Alfie Turcotte.
For his efforts in establishing GLAHA, Bessone received the first John MacInnes Award in 1983. The award, given out by the American Hockey Coaches Association, recognizes great concern for amateur hockey and youth programs.
In 1992, Bessone was inducted into the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame.
Bessone is also the namesake of numerous awards including:
Personal.
Bessone was married to the late Mary Kennedy Bessone. They had one son, John, who wrote for Sports Illustrated and was an associate television director for ABC Sports.
His older brother, Pete, played six games for the Detroit Red Wings in 1937-38. Pete had a successful career as a player in the AHL and is a member of the United States Hockey Hall of Fame.
Bessone retired first to Englewood, Florida with his brother Pete Bessone, then later to Santa Fe, New Mexico, with his son John Bessone. His final visit to the Michigan State campus was October 2006 for a reunion of the 1966 and 1986 NCAA national championship teams.

Project Magnet

Project Magnet was an unidentified flying object (UFO) study programme established by the Canadian Department of Transport (DOT) on December 2, 1950, under the direction of Wilbert B. Smith, senior radio engineer for the DOT's Broadcast and Measurements Section. It was formally active until mid-1954, and informally active without government funding until Smith's death in 1962. Smith eventually concluded that UFOs were probably extraterrestrial in origin and likely operated by manipulation of magnetism.
History.
Smith made a request to use the facilities of the Department of Transport to study UFOs. The project was formally approved on December 2, 1950 with the intention to collect data about UFOs and apply any recovered data to practical engineering and technology. The ultimate goal of the project was to apply any findings on the subject of geomagnetism to the possibility of exploiting Earth's magnetic field as a source of propulsion for vehicles. Smith and his colleagues in government believed that UFOs, if real, might hold the key to this new source of power. A small-scale undertaking, the project used DOT facilities, with some assistance from personnel at the Defence Research Board (DRB) and the National Research Council. In June 1952 Smith issued a preliminary report arguing that UFOs likely came from intelligent, extraterrestrial sources and almost certainly manipulated magnetism for flight. A 1953 report reiterated these conclusions. Also in April 1952 the Canadian government established Project Second Storey, a parallel UFO research project, with Smith also involved. It consisted of a group of scientists and military officers who met periodically to consider the UFO question and to recommend government action. Smith reported to Second Storey on some of Project Magnet's findings and conclusions. 
Smith believed UFOs were linked to psychic phenomena and believed himself to be in contact with extraterrestrial beings who communicated to him through telepathy. Smith wrote a number of articles for "Topside", the publication of the Ottawa New Sciences Club which he founded, outlining the philosophy of the "Space Brothers" with whom he claimed to be in contact. The articles were later collected and published posthumously in 1969 under the title "The Boys from Topside".
Shirley's Bay.
In October of 1952, Smith set up an observatory at Shirley's Bay, outside Ottawa to study reports of UFO sightings, believing that UFOs would emit physical characteristics that could be measured. A number of sighting reports were investigated by Project Magnet, but in 1954, the project was shut down. Smith was allowed to use the Shirley's Bay facilities with his own funding and did so until his death in 1962.

Antoine Lepautre

Antoine Lepautre or Le Pautre (1621–1679) was a French architect and engraver. Born in Paris, he was the brother of the prolific and inventive designer-engraver Jean Lepautre. Antoine Lepautre has been called " "one of the most inventive architects of the early years of Louis XIV's reign". He was a protégé of Cardinal Mazarin, to whom he dedicated his "Desseins de plusieurs palais" (Paris, 1652/3), in which his imagination is given free rein. 
In 1646–1648, Lepautre built a chapel for the Jansenist Convent of Port-Royal at Paris. 
His Hôtel de Beauvais (1655–1660), rue François-Miron, built for Pierre de Beauvais and his wife Catherine Henriette Bellier, "première dame de chambre" to Anne of Austria, brought Lepautre celebrity for the ingenious way he made use of a highly irregular parcel of land, ranging his structure round an oval court. The Hôtel de Beauvais's architectural qualities were noted by Bernini during his Paris sojourn, and it remains Lepautre's outstanding surviving monument.
He built the Château du Vaudreuil (Eure) in 1658–1660.
In 1660 Lepautre was appointed house architect to Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, the brother of Louis XIV. In this quality he built the wings for the lost Château de Saint-Cloud and constructed the celebrated Grand Cascade that survives in its park.
Drawings conserved in the Swedish National Museum of Fine Arts, Stockholm, demonstrate that Lepautre was the designer of stables for Jean-Baptiste Colbert at the Château de Sceaux, in the early 1670s.
Madame de Montespan commissioned him to make plans for her Château de Clagny, close to Versailles; the unfinished project was completed after Lepautre's death by Jules Hardouin-Mansart. For Antoine Nompar de Caumont, duc de Lauzun, Lepautre built the Hôtel de Lauzun at Saint-Germain-en-Laye.
In 1671 he was made a member of the Académie Royale d'Architecture.
The monograph in English is Robert W. Berger, "Antoine Le Pautre: a French architect of the era of Louis XIV" (New York University Press) 1969.

Rathor Dynasty

The Rathor Dynasty was a ruling dynasty in India.
History.
Its origins can be traced back to, the Surendar Singh Rathoe of Godhan Naguar between 1226 or 1250 and 1273. Later scholars claim that he was a son of Set Ram, a descendant of Maharajadhiraj Jai Chand.
In 1273, after Shivaji's death, Rao Asthanji became the sovereign of Palli when he expelled the Mer and Meenas tribes and later ousted Paliwal Brahmins. He later became the Rao of Khed, now Rajasthan, through military conquest defeating Gahlot ruler.
The later Rathors descended from Rao Shri Salkha's second son Rao Shri Viram Deo, whose son Rao Shri Chandra Sahib became the Rao of Mandore. The succession continued until Rao Shri Jodhaji Sahib became the Rao. He was eventually driven out of his capital by the man who killed his father, Chonda of Chittorgarh. The Rao later retook Mandore, though abandoned it and founded a new capital at Jodhpur. The Rathors established themselves in other states as well, first in Idar, Sailana and later in Ahmednagar.

Proto-Dené-Caucasian roots

The Proto-Dené–Caucasian language is the hypothetical common ancestor of the Basque, Burushaski, North Caucasian, Sino-Tibetan, Yeniseian, Na-Dené and possibly also other languages of Eurasia and North America.
The relationship among these languages and the existence of a Dene–Caucasian family is disputed or rejected by most linguists.
Several remarks must be made:
Other words.
The majority of the word forms in the table represent reconstructions in the respective proto-languages, to wit, Proto-Basque, Proto-North Caucasian, Proto-Burushaski, Proto-Sino-Tibetan, Proto-Yeniseian and Proto-Na-Dené (here meant to include Haida). Nevertheless, especially in the cases of Na-Dené, North Caucasian and Sino-Tibetan, some expressions have not been attested in the whole family and can only be traced back to the individual intermediate daughter (proto-)languages. See the footnotes for details. As for Proto-Na-Dené, its reconstruction is still in its infancy but may soon be improved thanks to the recently finished dictionary of Haida.

Wilhelm Mauser

Wilhelm Mauser, (May 2, 1834 - January 13, 1882) was a German weapon designer and manufacturer/industrialist.
Mauser was born in Oberndorf am Neckar, in what was then the Kingdom of Württemberg. His father and his four brothers were gunsmiths.
Together with his brother Paul Mauser (1838 - 1914) Wilhelm Mauser designed the Mauser Model 1871 rifle, the first of a successful line of Mauser rifles and pistols. The rifle was adopted as the Gewehr 71 or Infanterie-Gewehr 71 and was the first metal cartridge weapon of the German Empire. While Paul was the more technical of the two, Wilhelm handled this business side of the factory.
The Mauser company later developed the Gewehr 98 and Karabiner 98k rifle series. The Gewehr 98 itself was the latest in a line of Mauser rifles that were introduced in 1898.

Although Bradshaw was capable of designing fine Gothic Revival houses, like Watermillock (1880–86) near Bolton, he mainly produced industrial buildings. The technical challenges of early iron and concrete framed factories led Bradshaw to employ engineers and quantity surveyors and thus founded one of the first multidisciplinary practices. The emphasis on engineering in the practice seems to have benefited John Parkinson (1861–1935), Bradshaw's apprentice from 1877 to 1882, who immigrated to America where he designed a number of high-rise buildings including Los Angeles City Hall (1928).
In the early twentieth century, Bradshaw Gass & Hope gained national prominence after winning a number of architectural competitions; the firm built seven town halls between 1928 and 1939 and extended Bolton Town Hall. During this period, Bradshaw Gass & Hope attracted many architecture students; half a dozen of these students would later head council architects departments across the country.
Until the 1960s most of the firm's work was in the Classical idiom.
Sir George Grenfell-Baines, the founder of Building Design Partnership, worked in the Bolton office from 1930 to 1934; he was impressed by the firm's multidisciplinary nature but dismayed by its strict hierarchical structure (at that time).
Bradshaw Gass & Hope operates from its Bolton office. In 2007 it was the subject of a monograph and its archive drawings were exhibited in London and Manchester.

Airdrie Public Observatory

Airdrie Public Observatory (55° 51' 56" N, 03° 58' 58" W) is in the town of Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, Scotland. The observatory is open to the public by request, and is housed in Airdrie Public Library. Installed on the roof of the first purpose-built library building in 1896, it is the smallest, and second oldest, of four public observatories operating in the UK, all of which are sited in Scotland. The present library building was opened in 1925.
The observatory is owned and funded by North Lanarkshire Council and operated on their behalf by "Airdrie Astronomical Association (AAA)", a Scottish astronomy society and registered charity. Current honorary curators are Bob Webster and Gavin Bain.
Cooke Telescope.
The observatory's Cooke of York 6 inch refracting telescope is mounted equatorially and has a clockwork drive to track the stars across the sky. A manual mechanism is now used to rotate the observatory’s dome.
The Cooke eye-pieces for the telescope provided a range between 60 and 450 times magnification. The telescope has been adapted by the AAA to use more modern eye-pieces. Although the Cooke is not the original Airdrie telescope, it is believed that it is approximately 140 years old and, in its day, would have been considered to be a research grade telescope.
Other Telescopes.
The observatory has a number of smaller telescopes, binoculars, and two reflector telescopes (each belonging to the AAA or its members) which can be used on the roof of the observatory (no longer permitted), or alternatively, they can be removed to a dark sky site for observing sessions.
Original Telescope.
The original telescope was a 3 inch, brass-bodied, refracting telescope donated to the town by Dr. Thomas Reid, an eminent Glasgow oculist, in 1896.
This has now been retired as repairs cannot be undertaken due to its age and fragility, but it can still be seen in the local history room of the library to this day.
Observatory Buildings.
The observatory was founded in 1896 in the first purpose built library building of 1894. The second purpose built, and current, building was opened on 25 September 1925.
History.
In 1896 Dr. Thomas Reid, an eminent Glasgow oculist, donated a 3 inch brass-bodied, refracting telescope to the town, and it was housed in the library. He also donated the sum of £35 to convert a top-floor room, where a dome was built on the roof of the building for it. Robert Dunlop was the first Honorary Curator, followed shortly by Mr Peter Scotland.
A new library was built, near the first purpose-built library, with financial assistance from Airdrie Savings Bank and a second Carnegie grant (this time from the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust). It incorporated a new observatory dome on the library roof, and the original Dr Reid telescope was brought from the old observatory. A Cooke of York brass-bodied 6 inch refracting telescope was obtained by the observatory curator Ex-Baillie James Lewis for the sum of £500. Before the recent discovery of a receipt for this, local oral tradition had it that this was donated by Mr Coats of Coats Ironworks, Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire.
In 1977, the Observatory was threatened with closure due to storm damage. This is when Association in Scotland to Research into Astronautics stepped in (Ian Downie wrote to the local Council on 7 July 1977) and offered to repair the damage to the telescope and drive if the then Monkland's Council would fit a new dome. They duly did and ASTRA repaired the telescope.
The Observatory was re-opened on 4 October 1978 (Sputnik 1 anniversary) by Professor Vincent Reddish, Astronomer Royal for Scotland. ASTRA had been managing Airdrie Public Observatory on behalf of the local council until 2008.
In 2009 the curatorship passed to Airdrie Astronomical Association in Partnership with Airdrie Public Library.
The observatory has 2 Honorary Curators, Mr Bob Webster and Gavin Bain.
The observatory was visited by Brigadier General Charles Moss Duke Jr. Apollo 16 Lunar Module Pilot visited the observatory on 9 September 2010. Charlie also accepted the post of Honorary President of Airdrie Astronomical Association.
Colonel Al Worden Command Module Pilot of Apollo 15 was their next major visitor and new Honorary President.
Now a magnet for Apollo Astronauts1 having just welcomed Captain Dick Gordon Command Module Pilot of Apollo 12 to Airdrie.

Edric Connor

Edric Connor (2 August 1913–13 October 1968) was a pioneering Caribbean singer, folklorist and actor who was born in Trinidad. He was one of the trailblazers of the calypso genre in the United Kingdom, where he migrated in 1944 and chiefly lived and worked until his death from ancylostomiasis in Putney, London, at the age of 55.
Career.
Edric Esclus Connor was born in 1913 in Mayaro, Trinidad. He settled in England in 1944, making his debut on BBC radio two weeks later, in "Calling the West Indies". In 1951 he was responsible for bringing the Trinidad All Steel Percussion Orchestra - TASPO - to the Festival of Britain. In 1955, he recorded the first Manchester United Football Club song, "The Manchester United Calypso", FTB Pro. That same year, he and his wife Pearl, whom he had married in 1948, set up the Edric Connor Agency, representing black actors, dancers, writers and musicians, which later, in the 1970s, she ran under the name of the Afro-Asian-Caribbean Agency. In 1963 they set up the Negro Theatre Workshop, one of the UK's first black theatre groups.
Connor appeared on stage at London's Princess Theatre in 1956 in "Summer Song", the life told through the music of Antonín Dvořák, in which Connor was "given two of the show's most memorable moments in 'Deep Blue Evening' and 'Cotton Tail'." In 1958 he became the first black actor to perform for the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford, playing Gower in "Pericles", having been rrecommended for the role by Paul Robeson. Connor acted in a total of 18 films and was best noted for his role as Daggoo in "Moby Dick."
Connor also co-starred with Rita Hayworth, Robert Mitchum, and Jack Lemmon in the 1957 film "Fire Down Below", directed by Robert Parrish, playing the character Jimmy Jean, who was the third man on the "boat-for-hire" along with Mitchum and Lemmon.
In 1952, with his band "The Caribbeans" (subsequently called The Southlanders) Connor recorded a "groundbreaking LP of Jamaican folk music" entitled "Songs from Jamaica". This included the song "Day Dah Light", which portrayed the hard life of Caribbean field workers. The song was later recorded by Jamaican folk singer Louise Bennett in 1954, and was later rewritten by Irving Burgie and William Attaway in 1955. The version performed by legendary singer Harry Belafonte became popularly known as "Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)", reaching number five on the "Billboard" charts in 1957, and was even featured in the popular film directed by Tim Burton, "Beetlejuice", in 1988.
Connor's acting for television included roles in the espionage series "Danger Man": as the character Thompson in "Deadline" (1962, the final episode of the first series, which unusually featured an almost all-black cast), and memorably as opposition leader Dr Manudu in the series 2 episode entitled "The Galloping Major" (first aired on 3 November 1964).
Connor appeared on the BBC programme "Desert Island Discs" on 13 April 1959, when one of his choices was "Deep Blue Evening", from the show "Summer Song", a track on which he was a soloist.
Legacy.
His daughter Geraldine Connor (1952–2011) - herself a singer and ethnomusicologist - was instrumental in bringing to light her father's autobiography, "Horizons: The Life and Times of Edric Connor 1913-1968", which was written in the mid-1960s and only finally published in 2006. In 2005, Geraldine accepted an award on behalf of the Connor family from the British Association of Steelbands, in celebration of her family’s contribution to the Promotion of Steelband Music, Caribbean Art, Culture and Heritage throughout the United Kingdom. The Edric and Pearl Connor Papers, 1941-1978, were donated to the Alma Jordan Library at the University of the West Indies, St Augustine, Trinidad & Tobago, and additional material on them is housed in the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.
A prestigious annual award named after him, the Edric Connor Inspiration Award, is made annually in his honour in the Screen Nation Film & TV Awards. It was won by Joseph Marcell in 2012 and in 2011 by Sir Trevor MacDonald OBE, other previous winners including Moira Stuart (2007), Mona Hammond (2006) and Lenny Henry (2002). In 2014 the award was posthumously given to Felix Dexter.
His name is also associated with the "Edric Connor Trailblazer Award", of which a notable winner in 2003 was Rudolph Walker (who, coincidentally, in 1989, like Connor before him also played Gower in Shakespeare's "Pericles").

Ralph Salaway

Ralph Wellner Salaway (November 13, 1913 – October 25, 1991) was a California novelist who authored five books of hardboiled crime fiction in the 1950s and 1960 under the pseudonym Al Fray. Salaway's pseudonym is derived from the Pig Latin translation of his first name (and thus is a "pen" name in two senses.)
While his 1955 book, "And Kill Once More", is a whodunit in the classic style, Salaway's 1957 and 1958 novels have more to do with the common man's involvement in crime and the moral dilemmas that arise as he confronts his own behavior and that of others. In this way, Salaway's fiction may reflect the same zeitgeist that produced many of the most cerebral television scripts of the late 1950s and early 1960s such as those of Rod Serling ("The Twilight Zone", etc.) and Gene Roddenberry ("Have Gun, Will Travel", etc.). 
Salaway's final novel as Al Fray, 1960's "The Dame's the Game," involves a lawman of sorts—a Las Vegas casino house detective—who leaves legitimacy behind in the name of vengeance. Notes on the cover of that book refer to it as "A Barney Conroy Suspense Novel," suggesting that others existed or were planned; however, no others were published.

<doc id="9772713" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9772713" title="Feast (The Creatures album)">
Feast (The Creatures album)

Feast is the debut album by British duo The Creatures (comprised by Siouxsie Sioux and musician Budgie, then-members of the band Siouxsie and the Banshees). It reached number 17 in the U.K. charts and the "Miss the Girl" single peaked at number 21.
"Feast" was originally released in May 1983, two years after the "Wild Things" EP. It was entirely remastered in 1997 and reissued as part of the "A Bestiary Of" compilation.
Album history.
Siouxsie and Budgie decided where to record the album by randomly placing a pin on a map of the world; the result was the U.S. state of Hawaii. Several songs are about their experiences in that region, including "Festival of Colours" and "A Strutting Rooster".
The song title "Inoaʻole" is Hawaiian for "no name". "Ice House" was inspired by an obscure television play. "Dancing on Glass" is based on an Indian musical; during the studio session, the sounds of broken glass were created by Siouxsie and Budgie dancing on broken mirrors with tough shoes on.
The single "Miss the Girl" is a combination of a love affair and a crash car: it was inspired by the book "Crash", by J. G. Ballard.
Critical reception.
"Record Mirror" praised the album by the note of 4/5, and Paul Prayag wrote: "Siouxsie and Budgie are wondering deeper and deeper into a jungle that looks like having no easily definable boundaries".
"Melody Maker" described "Feast" as "an album of filtered brilliance, fertile, sensual and erotic; an album that, in its desperate naivety, attempts to articulate that moment when the monsoon ends, when the smell and the heat conspire in a perfumed mist and life sprouts instantly, green and luxurious."
"NME" also hailed it: "The Creatures have assembled a multifarious sonic boom that is as various and kaleidoscopic as can be imagined. The humours of Sioux's frosty larynx are nakedly outlined against skins of sometimes fabulous quality. The drum sound on 'Ice House' must be one of the greatest on record."

Ron Sellers

Ronald "Jingle Joints" Sellers (born February 5, 1947) is a former American football player. He played college football for Florida State University, where he was a two-time All-American (1967, 1968). Despite being limited to a total of 30 games of regular season eligibility, Sellers still holds Florida State career records for receptions, receiving yards, and most 200-yard receiving games.. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1988. A wide receiver, he played for the American Football League's Boston Patriots in 1969, when he was an AFL All-Star, then for the National Football League's Patriots, Dallas Cowboys and Miami Dolphins.
Early years.
Sellers attended Paxson High School where he excelled in football and basketball, helping his team win the 1965 state basketball championship.
He went on to star at Florida State University as a split end and flanker in the team's pro-style offense. In 1967 and 1968 he received All-America honors. He recorded 212 passes for 3,598 yards (an NCAA record at the time) and 23 touchdowns. He wore the number 34 which was retired by the school, until he gave linebacker Ernie Sims permission to use it while playing for the Seminoles.
Sellers still holds 17 receiving and scoring records at Florida State University- including 5 touchdowns against Wake Forest University. In 2007, he was named to The State of Florida’s “100 Greatest High School Football Players in Florida History”.
In 1973 he was inducted into the Florida Sports Hall of Fame, in 1977 he was inducted into the Florida State University Hall of Fame and in 1988 he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.
Professional career.
New England Patriots.
Sellers was drafted in the first round of the 1969 NFL Draft by the Boston Patriots. He earned AFL All-Star honors as a rookie after making 27 receptions for 705 yards, with 6 touchdowns and 26.1 average yards per reception.
In 1971 the team changed its name to the New England Patriots after relocating to Foxborough. During that season he missed four games due to injuries, lost his starting position. At the end of the year he was traded to the Super Bowl champions the Dallas Cowboys, in exchange for a third round draft choice.
Dallas Cowboys.
In 1972 he was a backup until the seventh game, when he was promoted to replace Bob Hayes in the starting lineup, in order to take advantage of his big play ability. Even though he finished the season as the Cowboys top receiver, registering 31 receptions for 653 yards, five touchdowns and a 21.1 yards average per reception, the team looked to upgrade its receiving corps, by trading him along with a second round draft choice to the Super Bowl champions the Miami Dolphins, in exchange for Otto Stowe.
Miami Dolphins.
With the Miami Dolphins he had a disappointing year and was released before the 1974 season started, after playing in three games and catching only two passes.

Edward Gordon Jones

Air Marshal Sir Edward ("Tap") Gordon Jones KCB, CBE, DSO, DFC (31 August 1914 – 20 February 2007) was an officer in the Royal Air Force for 34 years, from 1935 to 1969. He commanded a squadron of obsolescent biplane Gladiator fighters during the Greek Campaign in the Second World War, where he shot down five Italian Fiat CR.42 fighters. He served in mainly operational posts in Europe until he retired in 1969. Unusually, he never served a post in the Air Ministry or the UK Ministry of Defence.
Early life.
Jones was born in Widnes, the third of four sons of Lt.Col. Dr Albert Jones DSO, MC. His father was the borough medical officer. Jones spent time in India as a child, where his brothers nicknamed him "Doolally Tap" (meaning "slightly mad"). He retained the nickname "Tap" for the rest of his life.
After grammar school, he studied medicine at Liverpool University, where he met his future wife. His three brothers all became doctors, like their father, but Jones soon switched to veterinary science. He was a keen sportsman, representing Liverpool University and Lancashire at rugby union. He also enjoyed shooting and the outdoor life, but he showed little interest in his studies.
RAF.
Edward joined the RAF in 1935. He trained as a pilot at Netheravon and joined "B" Flight of No. 17 Squadron in Kenley, flying Gauntlet fighters. His flight was detached to form No. 80 Squadron in March 1937, which flew the Gladiator, the RAF's last biplane fighter. As a Pilot Officer, he was its adjutant from May 1937. He also played rugby for the RAF.
Promoted to Flying Officer, his squadron deployed to Egypt in April 1938. He became commander of "A" Flight of No. 80 Squadron in March 1940, while he was based in Amriya in Egypt.
Second World War.
After Italy declared war on the United Kingdom and France on 10 June 1940, Jones took charge of a flight armed with modern Hurricane fighters. He took charge of a flight of Gladiator when it moved to Trikala in central Greece in November 1940. He was in action within days, engaging a formation of more modern Fiat CR.42 fighters, also biplanes, of the Italian Regia Aeronautica to the north of Yanina. He shot down one on 27 November, then two more the next day over Delvinakion, but was injured in the dogfight and spent a month recovering from a bullet wound in his neck. He returned to duty on 21 December, and took command of No. 80 Squadron on 27 December, after its commander, Squadron Leader Bill Hickey, was killed in action.
Jones shot down two further Fiats on 28 February 1941, and was awarded an immediate DFC. He also received a DFC from the Greek government.
After leave in Egypt, Jones returned to No. 80 Squadron. It had been re-equipped with modern Hurricane fighters shortly before Germany invaded Greece on 6 April 1941. His battered squadron withdrew to Crete, then back to Egypt. Finally, it moved to RAF Aqir in Palestine to regroup, where it fought against the Vichy French in Syria. He left No. 80 Squadron in 1942, and was awarded the DSO.
He spent a year with the Rhodesian Air Training Group, then took command of the RAF fighter base at Hawkinge in Kent. He was promoted to Acting Group Captain in May 1943, and joined the staff preparing tactical fighter operations for D-Day. His group, No. 83 Group, transferred to France shortly after D-Day, and moved eastwards with the front line. He was appointed OBE in December 1944, when he returned to operational duties, taking command of No. 121 Wing with its four squadrons of Typhoon fighters, based at Volkel in the Netherlands.
Post-war career.
Jones had a succession of mainly operational appointments in Europe after the War. Unusually, he never served a post in the Air Ministry or the Ministry of Defence.
He served at the School of Land/Air Warfare, and then commanded a jet flying school. He was appointed CBE in 1956. He served at the Headquarters of the Second Tactical Air Force and with the Air Task Force during the Suez Crisis. He took command of RAF Wyton in 1957, the home base of the RAF's strategic reconnaissance forces.
He was promoted to Acting Air Commodore in January 1959, and took command of the Central Reconnaissance Establishment. He was appointed CB in 1960. He commanded RAF forces in Germany from 1961 to 1963, then spent two years as Senior RAF Officer at the Imperial Defence College. He took command of air forces in Malta as Deputy Commander-in-Chief (Air) of Allied Forces in the Mediterranean in 1965.
He was promoted to Air Marshal in November 1966, and took up the position of Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Near East Air Force (including responsibility for British Forces Cyprus and Administration of the Sovereign Base Areas). He was appointed KCB in 1967 and retired from the RAF in August 1969.
He continued to enjoy sport in his retirement.
Family.
He married Margery Thurston Hatfield in 1938. His wife died in 2002. He was survived by their two sons.

After his family returned to California, Kent attended Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley beginning in 1919. He then boarded for three years at the Thacher School to prepare for college. He graduated from Yale College in 1928. He stayed in New Haven after graduation, attending Yale Law School, from which he graduated in 1931. Kent practiced law in California and was admitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1937.
During World War II, he was a Naval officer, receiving the Silver Star for conspicuous gallantry in action at Guadalcanal.
After two unsuccessful campaigns as a Democratic candidate for Congress in 1948 and 1950, Kent went to Washington in 1952, at the close of the Truman Administration, as General Counsel for the U.S. Department of Defense, at a time when the Pentagon was under attack by Senator Joseph McCarthy.
Returning to California, Kent became Chairman of the Democratic State Central Committee, helping to elect Edmund G.

Fenmore Baldwin

Fenmore Michael "Fen" Baldwin is a fictional character from the American CBS soap opera "The Young and the Restless". Created by former head writers Lynn Marie Latham and Kay Alden as the son of Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc) and Lauren Fenmore (Tracey Bregman), the character was born onscreen during the episode airing on October 13, 2006. Initially portrayed by various child actors including Robbie Tucker, the character was rapidly aged to a teenager in 2012, with Max Ehrich assuming the role. 
As a teenager, the character's storylines have included a romance with Summer Newman (Hunter King), as well as a cyberbullying plot with Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo), which was generally well received by the actors and public. Fenmore has also developed a "dark side", coinciding with teenage angst. Ehrich characterized the character as being at a "vulnerable age", while "trying to find his place in the world". Ehrich's portrayal has received a positive response; Michael Fairman of "On-Air On-Soaps" described the actor as talented, as well as Luke Kerr of Zap2it praising Ehrich for "mastering the crazy behind-the-eyes element" of the character's relatives. Ehrich's portrayal garnered him a Daytime Emmy Award nomination in 2013.
Casting.
The role was first portrayed by three sets of twins, including Avital and Amiel Weiss, Matthew and Riley Esham, and Aiden and Andrew Gonzales over the course of 2006 to 2009. The role was then rapidly aged for the first time when Tucker assumed the role in October 2009. In May 2012, it was announced that the character had been rapidly aged again to a teenager, with Ehrich scheduled to join the cast. He made his debut on June 11, 2012. In an interview with "Soap Opera Digest", Ehrich stated that he had went through a "long audition process", saying: "I got a callback and did a chemistry read with someone, then came back to read with Christian LeBlanc. By the end of that audition, I knew something felt right and that he could be my father." When asked about signing a contract with the series, Ehrich stated: "I'm still on recurring right now. I think it's all relevant to your character and either way, in my book, it's awesome. I would sign, yes, but it'll happen when the time is right."
Development.
Characterization.
When Ehrich first stepped into the role, he stated: "There so many places where they can go with this role. I have just gotten back into Genoa City. It’s such a vulnerable age, so really there [are so many different paths I can go down. And there’s so much that can happen. I’m very, very curious to see where they go with it." When asked how he would describe Fenmore, Ehrich said: "He is definitely figuring himself out. You’re on the brink of adulthood. You have to start taking a bit of responsibility. your hormones start kicking in hardcore. So he’s definitely going through some stuff." In another interview, he described Fenmore as "trying to find his place in the world", saying: "When Fen first came back, I think he was at a very vulnerable age and was trying to find his place in the world; just really figure out who he is. He has such a strict dad, who just became D.A., so of course his morals are so strong and everything is black and white, right or wrong." Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that the character had become "creepy" during his angst and acting out.
Teenage angst.
When Fenmore and female character Summer Newman (Hunter King) were rapidly aged to teenagers at the same time, Deanna Barnert of MSN Entertainment previewed: "These two kids may learn about some of the insane things their parents have done – as fans know, that says a lot!" She also wrote that given who their parents are, "that can only mean trouble". Fenmore has dated Summer, to which Ehrich stated: "Everything he does is for his love for Summer. He has this obsession with her. Every action he does stems from that." In another interview, he stated of their relationship: "I think Fen’s first love is Summer; he falls in love; he’s infatuated with her. She plays games with him, and where it’s going is – will Fen get into her ways, or will he stand his ground? Everything Fenmore does is coming from his love for Summer, so he’s still the same kid, it’s just sometimes love makes you do some crazy thing Fenmore later began to enter a rebellious phase." Tracey Bregman (who portrays his mother Lauren) stated that she "was always hoping they would show the dark side of our child, because both Lauren and Michael have dark sides. That is something they both work hard on to suppress, that comes out now and them." Christian LeBlanc (who portrays his father Michael) stated Michael has "troubled youth to deal with", saying: "It’s the first time on "Y&R" that such a young storyline has pulled such focus. It’s going to be really fascinating. The whole family gets drawn in. The trouble with Fenmore affects Lauren and Michael. a rippling effect, like every good story." The character was later involved in a cyberbullying storyline with Summer and Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo). Michael Logan of "TV Guide" previewed the storyline, writing: "Adding fuel to the fire is young Fen Baldwin (Max Ehrich), who is so infatuated with Summer that he becomes her partner in crime — in fact, he takes things a few dangerous steps further once he sees Summer's growing fondness for Jamie." Ehrich liked the plot as he was bullied as a child, stating: "Kids do it out of their own sadness or insecurity, but needless to say that doesn’t matter when you’re a victim of it - you feel so isolated and so alone. To have a storyline that addresses it, it’s like, "This is real; this is what happens". People need to know the truth of what is going on out there." 
In another interview, Ehrich expressed more of his opinions on the storyline, stating: "It’s so relevant now and it’s such an epidemic. Just for it to be out there to show that it happens. This is a real issue that needs to be addressed. To be a part of that, and to spread awareness feels so nice because I’ve personally experience bullying and I know many friends who have. Whether people’s reason behind it are good or bad, nonetheless, it affects kids to such an extent especially young, vulnerable kids." Of the character's "dark side", Ehrich stated: "I love playing dark, but justifiably dark. It's never coming from a psychopathic place. First, he got obsessed with Summer, and that caused the bullying storyline, and now he's dealing with his parents' problems and possible divorce. Fenmore's issues come from a place that makes sense. It's interesting, because everyone around him is pretty much lying, and Fen is supposed to be the crazy one. Yet he's actually the truthful one." He also stated that "as an actor, it's fun to go out of control", saying: "As an actor, it’s fun when you’re out of control, and you don’t even know you’re acting. Like, literally, you just escape. And I got to feel that. And I’ve had numerous times on this show where I’ve gotten to be out of control, and it’s a really nice feeling. It’s exhilarating." He also revealed that he had been listening to the music of John Mayer and Bruno Mars to get into Fenmore's head space. Ehrich also conceded that he didn't want Fenmore to go "too far", saying: "He's a really troubled kid who is just trying to find his way in life. He's not evil. I don't think he's asking for too much except for some love and trust. He's on a journey—a long, long journey to find some peace."
Storylines.
Lauren Fenmore (Tracey Bregman) gave birth to Fenmore prematurely, and he was forced to remain in the hospital for a short time. Shortly after his birth, he was kidnapped, along with Phyllis Newman (Michelle Stafford) and her daughter, Summer Newman, by Sheila Carter, who had had cosmetic surgery to look like Phyllis. All are rescued when Lauren tracked down Sheila and shot her. In 2012, Fenmore was sent to stay with his half-brother, Scotty Grainger, in Canada due to Lauren's fear that Daisy Carter (Yvonne Zima), Sheila's daughter, would end up harming him. Months later, Fenmore returns a moody teenager, kindling a friendship with a teenaged Summer. They became close and later began a relationship. When Summer began harassing a boy named Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo) online, Fenmore was against the idea, but when his father, Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc), began looking out for Jamie, he became jealous and took over the bullying by sending him harassing text messages from a disposable cell phone. Fenmore's jealously continued when Michael and Lauren had Jamie move in with them temporarily. He attempted to frame Jamie for stealing his mother's expensive decoration, and attempted to take pictures of him with the decoration on a rooftop. The boys struggled and Jamie was found face down in the snow below. He accused Fenmore of pushing him, Michael believed Jamie over his own son and he was arrested. However, Jamie later confessed that Fenmore did not push him and he was exonerated. Michael and Lauren's marriage suffered due to the bullying ordeal. 
Fenmore was befriended by Carmine Basco (Marco Dapper), the man whom Lauren was having an affair with, while also trying to win over Summer again, who was crushing on Kyle Abbott (Hartley Sawyer). Fenmore asked Summer to their senior prom, and instead of going, Summer threw a party at her mother's penthouse. During a game of truth or dare, Fenmore was dared to kiss Summer, who had text messaged Kyle that she was in trouble. Kyle later punched Fenmore in the face; footage was caught on video and uploaded online, weakening Fenmore's social status. Afterward, he is befriended by Raven (Amanda Leighton); they go to a graduation party, do drugs and talk about their social struggles. When Fenmore discovers Carmine's affair with his mother, he isolates himself from his family and continues to do drugs. Afterward, he asks Carmine to help him obtain more drugs, and while he refuses, he finds Fenmore unconscious in the back of the local restaurant. When he awakens in the hospital, he tells his parents that Carmine gave him the drugs that he overdosed on, but he later confesses that this was a lie. After stealing drugs from the hospital and getting caught, Michael and Lauren send Fenmore to rehab. After being released for an event in which Lauren would be crowned businesswoman of the year, Carmine is shot to death in an alleyway. Fenmore is convinced he murdered Carmine but admits to being high on drugs at the time and can't remember clearly. Michael decides to confess to the murder to protect his family, and he is sent to prison. Knowing that his father did not kill Carmine, Fenmore steals drugs and purposely gets caught so he can be put in prison as well. While in prison, Fenmore tries to make deals with other prisoners to get his father's sentence reduced, as Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) and Christine Blair (Lauralee Bell) try to uncover the truth behind Carmine's death.
Reception.
Jillian Bowe of Zap2it was surprised by the decision to age both Fenmore and Summer Newman (Hunter King) at the same time. Omar White-Nobles of "TVSource" wrote, "Don't they grow up fast?", referring to soap opera rapid aging syndrome. Michael Fairman of "On-Air On-Soaps" wrote that aging the characters would help to "beef up" the soap opera's summer storylines. Roger Newcomb of the website We Love Soaps wondered if the character would "have issues with his parents the way other aged kids on the show have of late". Fairman later stated of Ehrich's portrayal: "Recently, the powers-that-be at "Y&R" chose to age Lauren and Michael’s tot of a son, Fenmore, to a teenager (another victim of Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome) and with that comes new complex problems for the Baldwins, and as it appears “Fen” may be a chip off the old block ... sort to speak. The talented Max Ehrich was cast as the new Fen, and since he has begun to air in the part he has received high marks, not only from his scene partners, but daytime fans, too." He also called Fenmore's family "one of the most fascinating TV families". Luke Kerr, also of Zap2it, wrote that he "really likes" Ehrich as Fenmore, stating: "He has totally mastered the Baldwin/Fisher crazy behind-the-eyes element of early Michael and Kevin (Greg Rikaart)." Jamey Giddens also wrote of the character's family storyline, saying: "A father hellbent on preventing his son from going down the same unspeakable path he once traveled; a mother who refuses to believe her child could be guilty of the heinous crime he's being accused of committing. No, this isn't the back page copy for Jodi Picoult's next best-selling novel, it's the saga of the Baldwins on "The Young and the Restless"!" 
In 2013, Ehrich received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal of Fenmore. On the day the actor was informed of his nomination, Ehrich stated: "I’ve been in daydream all day. I feel like I was hit by an electrical current." He admitted that it was a "pretty easy choice" choosing which scene to submit for consideration; Ehrich chose a scene where Fenmore tells Jamie that Summer is the one cyberbullying him. He stated that he chose that episode "because that day, I felt this outer body experience. I was not in control at all". Of his nomination, Ehrich stated: "It’s an honor, and it’s something I hope will hit me really soon, because it doesn’t feel real at all!" However, Ehrich lost the award to "Days of our Lives" star Chandler Massey for his portrayal of Will Horton.

Kinarut

Kinarut is a town in the outside of Kota Kinabalu in Sabah, Malaysia. It is located about 20 kilometres in the south of Kota Kinabalu, and has become one of the stops for the Sabah State Railway. Kinarut is currently under the administration of the Papar district, which is led by the district officer.
History.
Kinarut originally belonged to the Sultanate of Brunei. In the late 17th century, when Sultan Abdul Hakkul Mubin had to withdraw from Pulau Chermin during the Brunei Civil War, he built a base here at a strategic location protected by two rivers. He remained there for ten years as the Sultan of Kinarut and during this time the piracy off the coast significantly decreased. With help from the local Bajau and Dusun, he managed to counter several attacks from Sultan Muhyiddin.
The name of Kinarut is probably from the term "China Road" which emerged as a reference to a road that runs through the town. Maybe from the local Dusun word for "Kinorot" which means "cutting using a knife". The Dusuns of Kinarut originally from an area called "Nunuk Ragang" which is located in Ranau District. They migrated from Nunuk Ragang (Red Banyan tree) when that place was too populated. They dispersed to different areas. Some went to Tambunan, Keningau, Sandakan and Kudat. Some of them travelled south westerly towards the open areas of Kaiduan. The name "Kaiduan" comes from the Dusun word for "pogiduan" which means "a place to settle down". Some of them traveled further west downhill following a river called the Kinarut River where they settled down until today. Their first settlement in Kinarut was Kampung Labak and Langkuas.
Population.
The population of 18,029, according to the most recent census in 2010, consists mainly of Bajau (Samah), Bruneian Malay, Kadazan, Chinese, Dusun and a small number of Muruts. There is also a large Filipino refugee settlement in Kinarut, which has reportedly been the cause of some ethnic tension.
Infrastructure.
The main town of Pekan consists of shopping, residences, a kindergarten, and primary and secondary schools. Every Saturday, there is a street market known as "Tamu", where vendors set up tents and stalls and yell to advertise their goods and food. The Kinarut River park, the latest housing development in Kinarut, greatly increased the local population. Some popular tourist destinations in Kinarut include Kindawan Horse Riding Centre, Dinawan Island, Lok Kawi Wildlife Center and the beautiful beaches. There are also historical sites in the town, such as the ruins of Kinarut Mansion. The Jovi Souvenirs Shop, the only Kinarut handicraft shop is located at the Kinarut Railway station booth and is very popular with the International tourists from around the world who took the "Train Ride" or locomotive ride on Wednesdays and Saturdays.
Village.
Kinarut has divided into several villages:
Kampung Anak,
Kampung Laut,
Kampung Somboi,
Kampung Lepasan,
Kampung Sabok,
Kampung Tampasak,
Kampung Mook,
Kampung Langsat,
Kampung Kilirip,
Kampung Labak,
Kampung Kapalid,
Kampung Kaiduan,
Kampung Bisuang,
Kampung Bolotikon,
Kampung Nubong,

Line (ice hockey)

In ice hockey, a line is a group of forwards that play in a group, or "shift", during a game.
A complete forward line consists of a left wing, a center, and a right wing, while a pair of defensemen who play together are called "partners." Typically, an NHL team dresses twelve forwards along four lines and three pairs of defensemen, though some teams elect to dress a seventh defenseman, or a thirteenth forward. In ice hockey, players are substituted "on the fly," meaning a substitution can occur even in the middle of play as long as proper protocol is followed (under typical ice hockey rules, the substituting player cannot enter the ice until the substituted player is within a short distance of the bench and not actively playing the puck); substitutions can still be made during stoppages. Usually, coordinated groups of players (called linemates) are substituted simultaneously in what are called line changes. Linemates may change throughout the game at the coach's discretion.
Ice hockey is one of only a handful of sports (gridiron football being one of the most prominent others) that allows for unlimited free substitution and uses a system of multiple sets of players for different situations. Because of the use of lines in hockey, ice hockey rosters have relatively large rosters compared to the number of players on the ice (23 for a typical NHL team, with six on the ice at any given time). Only gridiron football has a larger relative roster size (the NFL has 53 players, 46 active on gameday, 11 on the field).

Trevor Hebberd

Trevor Neal Hebberd (born Winchester, Hampshire, 19 June 1958) is a retired English footballer who played as a midfielder.
Southampton.
He signed for Southampton on leaving school in 1974 and made his first team debut two years later in a 2–2 draw against Hull City at Boothferry Park in the Second Division. He managed 12 league appearances 1976–77, scoring twice. He made 12 appearances again in the 1977–78 season, scoring once, as the Saints won promotion to the First Division – where they would remain for the next 27 years.
Hebberd established himself as a regular player in the 1979–80 season, but lost his place in the team a year later. He played 11 league games in 1980–81 and just four in 1981–82. He had played 95 league games for the Saints, scoring seven goals.
He remained at Southampton until 1982, when he was sold to Oxford United. During his final season at Southampton, he had loan spells with Bolton Wanderers and Leicester City.
Oxford United and Derby County.
Hebberd was a key player in Oxford's Third Division title triumph in 1984 and their Second Division championship glory the following year. In 1986 he achieved the finest moment of his career by helping Oxford win the League Cup at Wembley with the opening goal in a 3–0 victory. He received the man of the match award.
When Oxford were relegated from the First Division in 1988, Hebberd was sold to Derby County and in his first season he helped them finish fifth in the league. But, like Oxford's League Cup triumph three years earlier, the ban on English clubs in European competition meant that Hebberd was unable to experience the UEFA Cup, and County were relegated to the Second Division two years later.
Later career.
In the autumn of 1991, Hebberd spent a month on loan at Portsmouth before leaving the Baseball Ground for good and being signed by Fourth Division side Chesterfield. He spent three years at Saltergate before signing for Lincoln City.
Hebberd joined Lincoln for the 1994–95 season. He made his senior debut for them on the opening day of the campaign, in a 2–0 victory over Exeter City. He played in most league games for Lincoln up until his final match, against Hartlepool United on 4 March 1995. In total he made 33 appearances for Lincoln before being given a free transfer at the end of the season.
Post-playing career.
He later worked in a warehouse in Leicester.

Philby's partridge

Philby's partridge ("Alectoris philbyi"), is a relative of the chukar, red-legged partridge and barbary partridges native to southwestern Arabia and northern Yemen. Although similar in appearance to other "Alectoris" species, Philby's partridge can be distinguished by its black cheeks and throat. Although not currently listed as an endangered species, the Arab Spring and destruction of its fragile habitat in the tribal areas of Northern Yemen had led to concerns about the survival of this species.
Kosher bird expert Chaim Loike is investigating whether this species is kosher.
The name commemorates the British explorer St. John Philby.

Joint stability

Joint stability refers to the resistance offered by various musculoskeletal tissues that surround a skeletal joint. Several subsystems ensure the stability of a joint. These are the passive, active and neural subsystems. The opposite of stability is instability. It is believed that one or more of the subsystems must have failed if joint instability occurs.
The bony components that may relate to the potential for joint instability can be measured by use of x-rays. Plain film lateral x-rays can be used to evaluate for translations anteriorly (anterolisthesis) or posteriorly (retrolisthesis). Where plain films indicate the likelihood of these translations being significant, flexion-extension views can be utilized to determine the dynamic range of movement of joints. This allows for a more accurate view of any potential instability issues.

<doc id="9772947" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9772947" title="Boiler feedwater">
Boiler feedwater

Boiler feedwater is water used to supply ("feed") a boiler to generate steam or hot water. At thermal power stations the feedwater is usually stored, pre-heated and conditioned in a feedwater tank and supplied to the boiler by a boiler feedwater pump.
History of Feedwater treatment.
During the early development of boilers, water treatment was not so much of an issue, as temperatures and pressures were so low that high amounts of scale and rust would not form to such a high amount, especially if the boiler was cleaned and/or “blown down”. It was general practice though, to install zinc plates and/or alkaline chemicals to reduce corrosion within the boiler. Many tests had been preformed to try and determine the cause and possible protection from corrosion in boilers using distilled water, various chemicals, and sacrificial metals. Use of lime for alkalinity control had been mentioned as early as 1900, and was used by the French and British Navies up until about 1935. In modern boilers though, treatment of boiler feedwater is extremely critical, as many problems can result from the use of untreated water in extreme pressure and temperature environments; this includes lower efficiency in terms of heat transfer, overheating, damage, and high costs of cleaning.
Conditioning.
The feedwater must be specially treated to avoid problems in the boiler and downstream systems. Untreated boiler feed water can cause corrosion and fouling.
Boiler corrosion.
Corrosive compounds, especially O2 and CO2 must be removed, usually by use of a deaerator. Residual amounts can be removed chemically, by use of oxygen scavengers. Additionally, feed water is typically alkalized to a pH of 9.0 or higher, to reduce oxidation and to support the formation of a stable layer of magnetite on the water-side surface of the boiler, protecting the material underneath from further corrosion. This is usually done by dosing alkaline agents into the feed water, such as sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) or ammonia. Corrosion in boilers is due to the presence of dissolved oxygen, dissolve carbon dioxide,dissolved salts
Fouling.
Deposits reduce the heat transfer in the boiler, reduce the flow rate and eventually block boiler tubes. Any non-volatile salts and minerals that will remain when the feedwater is evaporated must be removed, because they will become concentrated in the liquid phase and require excessive "blow-down" (draining) to prevent the formation of solid precipitates. Even worse are minerals that form scale. Therefore, the make-up water added to replace any losses of feedwater must be demineralized/deionized water, unless a purge valve is used to remove dissolved minerals.
Locomotive boilers.
Steam locomotives usually do not have condensers so the feedwater is not recycled and water consumption is high. The use of deionized water would be prohibitively expensive so other types of water treatment are used. Chemicals employed typically include sodium carbonate, sodium bisulfite, tannin, phosphate and an anti-foaming agent.
Treatment systems have included:

Bovine ephemeral fever

Bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) also known as Three Day Sickness is an arthropod vector-borne disease of cattle and is caused by the "Ephemerovirus" virus of the "Rhabdoviridae" family of virus. The "Rhabdoviridae" are a class V virus according to the Baltimore classification of viruses. The BEF virus is a bullet or cone shaped virion which consists of a negative, single stranded RNA genome with a lipid envelope and 5 structural proteins. The envelope glycoprotein G contains type-specific and neutralizing antigenic sites. Theres has been recent evidence which demonstrated that the BEF virus induces apoptosis in several cell lines. It was however shown that apoptosis could be blocked by the caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-fmk), indicating that bovine ephemeral fever virus induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in cultured cells.
Location.
The virus has been found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa and through eastern Australia.
Transmission.
The virus is transmitted by an insect vector. The particular species linked to the virus are the biting midges "Culicoides oxystoma" and "C. nipponensis".
Disease Characteristics.
The characteristics of the disease are the sudden onset of fever, stiffness, lameness and nasal and ocular discharges. BEF often causes hypocalcaemia which in turn generates clinical signs such as depression, cessation of rumination, muscle tremors and constipation. 
Although the pathogensis of the disease is complex it seems clear that the host inflammatory responses, mediated by the release of cytokines, are involved in the expression of the disease.
Diagnosis.
The virus can be isolated from blood and can be identified by immunofluorescence and immunostaining. Rising antibodies in two samples taken 2-4 weeks apart also indicate infection.
Treatment.
Calcium borogluconate and NSAIDs often help to alleviate clinical signs, but rest is absolutely imperative, for a mimimum of one week or death can still occur.
Control.
A vaccine is available in Japan but is very expensive which limits its use. Movement regulations are in place in several countries.

Birmingham Stechford by-election, 1977

The Birmingham Stechford by-election, in Birmingham, on 31 March 1977 was held after Labour Member of Parliament (MP) Roy Jenkins resigned his seat following his appointment as President of the European Commission. A seat that had been solidly Labour since its formation in 1950, it was won by Andrew MacKay of the Conservative Party, before being regained by Labour in 1979. The by-election was noted for the strong performance of the National Front candidate and the presence of two far left candidates.
Background.
As a leading Labour sitting MP Roy Jenkins had hoped to become Foreign Secretary in the government of James Callaghan but was overlooked in favour of Anthony Crosland. Following this Jenkins was nominated as President of the European Commission in succession to François-Xavier Ortoli, a move which necessitated his departure from Parliament.
Candidates.
With the seat being solid Labour Party territory the by-election presented the possibility of a return to Parliament for Terry Davis, who had served as member for the defunct Bromsgrove seat from 1970 until its abolition in 1974. Davis however failed to take the seat and began a pattern for the ailing Labour government who also lost the next by-election in Ashfield when David Marquand followed Jenkins to a role in the Commission.
It also left the governing Labour Party without a majority and resulted in a vote of no confidence being issued, although the government won and was able to cling onto power by forming a pact with the Liberals.
The Conservative candidate Andrew MacKay won the election with a majority of nearly 2000, although ultimately he would only hold the seat until 1979 when it was regained for Labour. MacKay would go on to enjoy a long parliamentary career representing a number of constituencies.
The Liberal Party candidate was Graham Gopsill, a Birmingham councillor who finished the by-election in a lowly fourth place. Gopsill would later serve the Liberal Democrats in Droitwich Spa until his death in 2009. He was beaten into fourth by National Front candidate Andrew Brons, a veteran of a number of far right movements and member of the NF National Directorate who eventually became NF chairman in 1980. Other candidates to appear on the ballot were leftist duo Brian Heron of the International Marxist Group and journalist Paul Foot for the Socialist Workers Party.

The Springfield Three

The Springfield Three is an unsolved missing person case that began on June 7, 1992, when Sherrill Levitt, Suzie Streeter and Stacy McCall went missing from their home on 1717 E. Delmar St, Springfield, Missouri. Their whereabouts or their remains have never been discovered.
Sherrill Elizabeth Levitt ("nee" Williams).
Sherrill, the mother of Suzanne Streeter, was born on November 1, 1944 (age 47 in June 1992). At the time of her disappearance, she was , , with short light blonde hair and brown eyes. Her ears are pierced.
Suzanne "Suzie" Elizabeth Streeter.
Suzanne was born on March 9, 1973 (age 19 in 1992), and at the time of her disappearance was , , with shoulder length blonde hair and brown eyes. She has a scar on her upper right forearm and a small mole on the left corner of her mouth. Her teeth may appear larger than normal. Both of her ears are pierced; the left ear is pierced twice, including a hole in the upper portion of her ear,
Stacy Kathleen McCall.
Stacy was born on April 23, 1974 (age 18 in 1992), and at the time of her disappearance was and . She has pierced ears, long dark blonde hair and light-colored eyes, and a birthmark on her chin near her lip and on her right arm.
Events leading up to the disappearance.
Stacy McCall and Suzanne Streeter graduated from Kickapoo High School on June 6, 1992. They were last seen at around 2:00 am on June 7 as they left a graduation party at a friend's house. They were also at Battlefield, Missouri at some point that night. The pair planned to spend the night at a friend's house, but when the friend's house became too crowded, they instead left to go to Streeter's mother's house. Sherrill Levitt, 47, a hairdresser at a local salon, was a single mother and especially close to her only daughter. It appeared that they arrived at the residence, because their clothing, jewelry, purses and vehicles were still at this location.
Facts surrounding the case.
The parents of Stacy McCall contacted police in reference to their daughter's disappearance from Levitt's home, at least twelve hours after the women were last seen. Other friends and family began calling and visited the house during the day. The police later admitted that the crime scene had possibly been tainted by the twenty or so people who visited Levitt's house. Upon officers' arrival, the house bore no signs of a struggle, except for a shattered porch globe (the light bulb was still illuminated) that was cleaned up by well-meaning friends of the missing women. All personal property was left behind including purses, money, cars, keys, cigarettes, and the family dog.
Levitt was last heard from at approximately 11:15 p.m. on June 6, 1992, when she talked with a friend about painting a chest of drawers. Levitt's car and the furniture she was refinishing as well as her personal belongings were found inside the residence, and it appeared her bed had been slept in when friends and police arrived to check the residence.
Suspects.
Robert Craig Cox told journalists that he knew the women had been murdered and buried and claimed their bodies would never be recovered. Cox, a convicted kidnapper and robber and the suspect in a Florida murder (convicted of the murder until overturned by the Florida Supreme Court), told investigators that he was staying the night with his girlfriend in the Springfield area the night the women disappeared; he later told investigators that he stayed at the home of his parents, who confirmed his alibi. Authorities are uncertain if Cox was involved in the case or if he is seeking attention by issuing false statements. Cox has told authorities and journalists that he will tell them what happened to the three women after his mother dies.
Local rumors surround Springfield businessman Gerald Carnahan. Carnahan was convicted December 2010 of the abduction, rape and murder of 20-year-old Jackie Johns of Nixa, Missouri, in 1985. Although he had been the prime suspect in that case since it occurred, attempts to charge him with the crime failed due to lack of evidence until 2007, after his DNA was matched to a preserved semen sample from the 22-year-old cold case. He served a two-year sentence for the attempted abduction of 18-year-old Heather Starkey in 1993, and another four-year sentence for burglary and arson after attempting to burn down a rival business. He was a free man in 1992; there is nothing to suggest that Carnahan was ever questioned or considered a suspect in the case of the Springfield Three by police. Carnahan is serving a life sentence for the Johns murder.
In media.
The case remains unsolved despite over 5,000 tips from the public. In June 2002 a bench dedicated to the women inside the Victim’s Memorial Garden in Springfield’s Phelps Grove Park was covered with flowers and mementos, marking the 10th anniversary of the disappearance.
The case has been featured on "48 Hours," "Unsolved Mysteries" and "America's Most Wanted". In March 2011 Investigation Discovery aired "The Springfield Three" on its "Disappeared" TV series.

Campus High School

Campus High School is a fully accredited public high school located in Wichita, Kansas, serving students in grades 9-12. The current principal is Myron Regier. Campus High School is the only high school that serves the Wichita suburb of Haysville. The school colors are black and white with an accent of gold. The current enrollment is approximately 1,500 students.
Campus High School is a member of the Kansas State High School Activities Association and offers a variety of sports programs. Athletic teams compete in the 6A division and are known as the "Colts". Extracurricular activities are also offered in the form of performing arts, school publications, and clubs. 
The school layout features and College "Campus" type courtyard with sidewalks going to each end of the building, and a clock-tower with a bell underneath. It also has numerous sports fields north of the building, and a nearby lake which is used for Science classes.
History.
Early Years.
Campus High School was established in 1960 with the name, Rural High School District 191. At the time, it served several communities including Oatville, South Riverside, and Enterprise. The name "Campus" was chosen by the students who were to attend the new high school. The following year, the Wichita district annexed part of the high school, reducing the student population by nearly half and causing large public sentiment. The annexed buildings would remain empty from 1961 until Freeman Elementary School was relocated to the site in 1966. Campus has had four additions to the original facility in the past 40 years.
Recent Years.
The school underwent renovation to turn it into a single building. The renovation includes a new, larger cafeteria, a new library, and new offices, as well as renovations on all of the other buildings except "J", now renamed "F" building, the science building. The renovation was completed before the 2008-09 school year. The courtyard, media center, and theatre were all completed in December 2008.
Extracurricular activities.
Athletics.
The Colts compete in the Ark Valley Chisholm Trail League and are classified as a 6A school, the largest classification in Kansas according to the Kansas State High School Activities Association. Throughout its history, Campus has won one state championship. In recent years, Derby High School has become their main rival.
Non-athletic Programs.
Theatre.
Campus High School's Theatre Department is under the direction of Roxana Stitt. Campus calls their theatre department Campus Mane Stage Theatre ("Mane" being like the colt's mane). Campus theatre has a Thespian troupe called Thespian Troupe #573 which is a part of the International Thespian Society, because of this the troupe members go to Kansas State Thespian Conference once every year in January. Honors include many Gold Honor Troupe 2004, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014; Silver Honor Troupe 2005, 2007 and 2011; and Bronze Honor Troupe 2003. The theatre department also has an improv troupe, Mane Stage Maniacs. Productions take place in the Campus High School auditorium which seats over 700 people. Recent Productions include The King and I, EAT: It's Not About Food, Where the Lilies Bloom, The Pajama Game, The Surprising Story of the Three Little Pigs, and Rehearsal for Murder, A Year With Frog & Toad, Meet Me in St. Louis, and George Washington Slept Here. Campus High School enters into the Music Theatre of Wichita Jester Awards, which honors Wichita area high schools for the quality of their musicals, Campus has received 11 awards in the past 4 years entering. On Friday May 17, 2013 Thespian Troupe #573 won 2 Jester awards for the King and I. The King and I won small ensemble for their dance in 'Small House of Uncle Thomas'.
Band.
Campus also has a band program. The band is directed by Becky Hughes assisted by Jim Maxwell and Scott Griffith. The marching band is one of 10% in the nation that does different halftime shows at the school's football games. In the past 10 years the band has received a 1 rating.

Costotransverse joint

The costotransverse joint is the joint formed between the facet of the tubercle of the rib and the adjacent transverse process of a thoracic vertebra. 
The costotransverse joint is a plane type synovial joint which, under physiological conditions, allows only gliding movement.
This costotransverse joint is present in all but the eleventh and twelfth ribs. The first ten ribs have two joints in close proximity posteriorly; the costovertebral joints and the costotranseverse joints. This arrangement restrains the motion of the ribs allowing them to work in a parallel fashion during breathing. If a typical rib had only one joint posteriorly the resultant swivel action would allow a rib to be non-parallel with respect to the neighboring ribs making for a very inefficient breathing.
The intercostal nerves innervate the costotransverse joints. Therefore, therapeutic medial branch blocks are ineffectual. 
The ligaments of the joint are:

Beaver Dam State Park (Illinois)

Beaver Dam State Park is an Illinois state park on in Macoupin County, Illinois in the United States. The park is southwest of Carlinville, Illinois and is managed by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) as a public place for fishing. 
The state park centers on the Beaver Dam Lake, an artificial reservoir which was created by a private Carlinville fishing club in the 1890s. The club later became a private resort which catered to visitors who arrived via the adjacent Chicago and Alton Railroad. During the Great Depression, the resort failed. The state of Illinois purchased the lake and some adjacent property in 1947. Additional land purchases have created the present-day Beaver Dam State Park.
The IDNR manages Beaver Dam Lake for the fishing of largemouth bass, bluegill, channel catfish, and sunfish. In addition, the park offers opportunities for the hunting of deer, wild turkey, and small game. There is a power limit for boats using the Beaver Dam Lake reservoir, with no gasoline-powered motors allowed. 
Beaver Dam State Park preserves part of the historic oak-hickory forests that line upper Macoupin Creek. There are of hiking trails in the park. The reservoir and park drain into a tributary of Macoupin Creek.

<doc id="9773128" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9773128" title="Line array">
Line array

A line array is a loudspeaker system that is made up of a number of usually identical loudspeaker elements mounted in a line and fed in phase, to create a near-line source of sound. The distance between adjacent drivers is close enough that they constructively interfere with each other to send sound waves farther than traditional horn-loaded loudspeakers, and with a more evenly distributed sound output pattern.
Line arrays can be oriented in any direction, but their primary use in public address is in vertical arrays which provide a very narrow vertical output pattern useful for focusing sound at audiences without wasting output energy on ceilings or empty air above the audience. A vertical line array displays a normally wide horizontal pattern useful for supplying sound to the majority of a concert audience. Horizontal line arrays, by contrast, have a very narrow horizontal output pattern and a tall vertical pattern. A row of subwoofers along the front edge of a concert stage can behave as a horizontal line array unless the signal supplied to them is adjusted (delayed, polarized, equalized) to shape the pattern otherwise. Loudspeakers can be designed to be arrayed horizontally without behaving as a horizontal line source. 
Modern line arrays use separate drivers for high-, mid- and low-frequency passbands. For the line source to work, the drivers in each passband need to be in a line. Therefore, each enclosure must be designed to rig together closely to form columns composed of high-, mid- and low-frequency speaker drivers. Increasing the number of drivers in each enclosure increases the frequency range and maximum sound pressure level, while adding additional boxes to the array will also lower the frequency in which the array achieves a directional dispersion pattern.
The large format line array has become the standard for large concert venues and outdoor festivals, where such systems can be flown (rigged, suspended) from a structural beam, ground support tower or off a tall A-frame truss tower. Since the enclosures rig together and hang from a single point, they are more convenient to assemble and cable than other methods of arraying loudspeakers. The lower portion of the line array is generally curved backward to increase dispersion at the bottom of the array and allow sound to reach more audience members. Typically, cabinets used in line arrays are trapezoidal, connected by specialized rigging hardware.
History.
The line array effect of the narrowing of the beam with increasing frequency was first demonstrated by acoustical pioneer Harry Olson. He published his findings in his 1957 text, "Acoustical Engineering". Olson used line array concepts to develop the column speaker in which vertically aligned drivers in a single enclosure produced mid-range output in a wide horizontal and narrow vertical pattern. Line arrays have been around for over half a century but until recently most were voice range only. The application for these were for highly reverberant spaces where a narrow vertical design kept from exciting the reverberant field.
A multi-band line array elements in a horizontally oriented enclosure was suggested by Joseph D'Appolito in 1983. However, it was L-Acoustics' V-DOSC line array in the mid-1990s that would show the concert world that a more level and smoother frequency response can come from fewer boxes in a line array. As soon as people realized that there was no destructive interference in the horizontal plane and waves combine mostly in phase in the vertical plane, the race was on for loudspeaker manufacturers.
Theory.
Pure line array theory is based on pure geometry and the thought experiment of the "free field" where sound is free to propagate free of environmental factors such as room reflections or temperature refraction.
In the free field, sound which has its origin at a point (a point source) will be propagated equally in all directions as a sphere. Since the surface area of a sphere = 4π r² where r is the radius, every doubling of the radius results in a four-fold increase in the sphere's surface area. The result of this is that the sound intensity quarters for every doubling of distance from the point source. Sound intensity is the acoustic power per unit area, and it decreases as the surface area increases since the acoustic power is spread over a greater area. The ratio between two acoustic pressures in deciBels is expressed by the equation dB = 20log(p1/p2), so for every doubling of distance from the point source p1 = 1 and p2 = 2, thus there is an sound pressure loss of approximately 6 dB.
A line source is a hypothetical one-dimensional source of sound, as opposed to the dimensionless point source. As a line source propagates sound equally in all directions in the free field, the sound propagates in the shape of a cylinder rather than a sphere. Since the surface area of the curved surface of a cylinder = 2π r h, where r is the radius and h is the height, every doubling of the radius results in a doubling of the surface area, thus the sound pressure halves with each doubling of distance from the line source. Since p1 = 1 and p2 = 4 for every distance doubled, this results in a sound pressure loss of approximately 3 dB.
In reality, dimensionless point sources and one-dimensional line sources cannot exist; however, calculations can be made based on these theoretical models for simplicity. A cone driver, for instance, may have an actual width of 12 inches, but the farther a listener is from the driver, the more it behaves as a point source as its dimensions become less significant. Thus there is only a certain distance where a line source of a finite length will behave as one -- past a certain point, it begins to act more as a point source when its length becomes insignificant. Thus, a true line source has to be infinitely long.
Interference pattern is the term applied to the dispersion pattern of a line array. It means that when you stack a number of loudspeakers vertically, the vertical dispersion angle decreases because the individual drivers are out of phase with each other at listening positions off-axis in the vertical plane. The taller the stack is, the narrower the vertical dispersion will be and the higher the sensitivity will be on-axis. A vertical array of like drivers will have the same horizontal polar pattern as a single driver.
Other than the narrowing vertical coverage, the length of the array also plays a role in what wavelengths will be affected by this narrowing of dispersion. The longer the array, the lower frequency the pattern will control. At frequencies below 100 Hz (wavelength of 11.3 ft) the drivers in a line array will start to become omnidirectional, so the system will not conform to line array theory across all frequencies. It is theoretically possible to construct an audio line array that follows the theory at low frequencies. However, the array requires more than 1,000 fifteen-inch drivers, spaced twenty inches center to center, to do it. Above about 400 Hz the low-frequency cones become directional, again violating the theory’s assumptions, and at high frequencies, many practical systems use directional waveguides whose behavior cannot be described using classical line array theory. In short, the geometry of real-world audio line arrays is too complicated to be modeled accurately by ‘pure’ line array theory.
High frequencies.
Practical line array systems act as line sources only in the low- and mid- frequencies. For the high frequencies, some other method must be employed to attain directional characteristics that match those of the lows and mids. The most practical method for reinforcement systems is to use wave guides (horns) coupled to compression drivers. Each horn must have a very narrow vertical and a very wide horizontal dispersion.
Rather than using constructive and destructive interference, horns achieve directionality by reflecting sound into a specified coverage pattern. In a properly designed line array system, that pattern should closely match the low-frequency directional characteristic of the array. If the array's vertical dispersion is 60 degrees and there are 12 boxes, then each horn would need to have 5 degree vertical coverage. (Narrow vertical coverage has the benefit that it minimizes multiple arrivals, which would harm intelligibility.) If this is achieved, then the wave guide elements can be integrated into the line array and, with proper equalization and crossovers, the beam from the high frequencies and the constructive interference of the low frequencies can be made to align so that the resulting arrayed system provides consistent coverage.
Configurations.
Two configurations that are rarely used are the straight and curved array. The problem with curved arrays is that they are not very well suited to the average venue. While the bottom half will be angled down to provide extra coverage at locations close to the front of stage, the top half will be angled upwards at the ceiling. Also, the problem with straight line arrays is that the beam is far too narrow at high frequencies. A solution to utilise the best features of both arrays is to use a ‘J’ array. This is made up of a straight line portion and a curved portion, normally at the bottom. This provides a long throw straight line component for people relatively far away, while the curve at the bottom acts as an in-fill for the area underneath the array that would otherwise be neglected
Spiral arrays are the next development from J-arrays, and have a superior frequency response due to their similar polar pattern at shifting frequencies, while still retaining the long throw and in-fill benefits that J-arrays provide. The concept is that spiral arrays are curved all the way along the array, but the curve is progressive. This means that the top of the array is almost straight with angles of 1° between boxes, and increases at the bottom to between 6° and about 10°. A well designed spiral array could have an almost constant directivity pattern with frequency, with some small lobes exhibited at low frequencies.
Design and rigging.
Large-format line arrays are designed for large venues or outdoor festivals. These boxes typically included multiple vertically aligned high frequency compression drivers and multiple midrange and low drivers arranged symmetrically around the compression driver. The low frequency driver is typically 15 or 18 inches in diameter. Mid-format line arrays are typically two or three way and use 10 or 12 inch low-frequency drivers. The horizontal coverage is typically 90 degrees wide but some systems employ narrower boxes at the top or wider boxes at the bottom of the array. Using a transition frame (which aligns the rigging on dissimilar systems), system engineers may sometimes hang a mid-format box below a large-format box to cover the closest audience members. Speaker boxes from different manufacturers are not mixed because each system has a particular 'voicing' which may be common to a single manufacturer.
Manufacturers typically provide a spreadsheet or custom program to design arrays. Examples include L-Acoustics SOUNDVISION, Adamson Shooter, Electro-Voice LAPS (Line Array Prediction Software), and JBL Vertec Line Array Calculator. Renkus Heinz offers a program called EaseFocus. It is similar to EASE but has only features and calculations specific to Line arrays. EaseFocus has data for a large number of manufacturers allowing comparison of several loudspeaker systems. Meyer Sound offers a different solution by providing an online system called MAPP Online Pro.
The design process starts by entering the dimensions of the room and the required sound pressure level. The program then suggests the number and arrangement of boxes. Alternatively some programs require you to enter the number of boxes and it will predict the resulting sound pressure levels in different parts of the room.
Once designed, the rigging points are hung from the structure, followed by chain motors (or blocks), flying frame and then the speakers. The individual boxes may be connected one at a time or rigged together on the ground and then pulled up. As the array is lifted, individual box angles are adjusted to match the array prediction program. The top frame may have an inclinometer to confirm the angle of the frame or laser attached which indicates the upper aiming point of the array.
If height or lack of rigging points does not permit flying the speakers, the speakers are typically stacked on the stage or on subwoofers using a custom stacking frame. Stacking of line arrays is common in smaller venues and in temporary installations. Compared to flown speakers, they require less vertical dispersion to cover front to back and the resulting array will have little curvature.

Elisabeth Scott

Elisabeth Whitworth Scott (20 September 1898 – 19 June 1972) was a British architect who designed the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford-upon-Avon, England. This was the first important public building in Britain to be designed by a female architect.
Early life.
Scott was born in Bournemouth, England, one of ten children of Bernard Scott, a surgeon. She was a great-niece of the architects George Gilbert Scott and George Frederick Bodley and second cousin of Giles Gilbert Scott, architect of Liverpool Cathedral. She was educated at home until the age of fourteen, when she enrolled at the Redmoor School, Bournemouth. In 1919 she became one of the early students at the Architectural Association's new school in Bedford Square, London, graduating in 1924.
Career.
Scott's first position was with the architects David Niven and Herbert Wigglesworth, a practice specialising in the Scandinavian style. In turn she became an assistant to Louis de Soissons, a progressive architect producing work in the contemporary style for the new garden city of Welwyn, Hertfordshire, and the modernist Oliver Hill.
Shakespeare Memorial Theatre.
In 1927 a competition for a replacement to the burnt-out Shakespeare Memorial Theatre was announced and Scott entered, with a confidence in her own abilities taken from the sound theoretical grounding at the Architectural Association's school. At the time she was working for Maurice Chesterton's practice at Hampstead, London, and Chesterton agreed to oversee her proposals for feasibility. She was assisted by two fellow AA students: Alison Sleigh and John Chiene Shepherd. On winning the competition (against seventy-one other entries) the four formed a partnership to prepare the detailed plans and supervise the construction.
The reaction to Scott's design was mixed. The "Manchester Guardian" suggested that, although the design reflected the building's purpose, its bulk in the small town was "startling...monstrous brutal." "The Times" did not agree, noting how well the building "adapt[ed itself to the lines of the river and landscape". Sir Edward Elgar, then 75, was to be the theatre's new musical director but, after visiting the building, he so was furiously angry with that "awful female" and her "unspeakably ugly and wrong" design that he would have nothing further to do with it, refusing even to go inside. On the other hand playwright George Bernard Shaw, a member the SMT committee notwithstanding his earlier telegram of congratulations to its chairman on having the unsuitable old building burnt down, was a firm supporter of Scott's design as the only one to show any theatrical sense. Scott herself acknowledged that in her design she had not intended to conceal the functionality of the building.
Although most criticism was directed at the building's external form, in the auditorium the performers—although acknowledging that Scott had been at the mercy of her theatrical advisors: William Bridges-Adams, Barry Jackson and stage designer Norman Wilkinson (1882–1934)—found that it was curiously difficult to connect with their audience: evidently the large, plain expanse of the cream-painted side walls had the effect of diffusing attention from the stage. Only in 1951, when the gallery seating was extended along the sides, was this overcome. However the building's lack of "meaningless decoration" was one of the features enthusiastically praised in the special June 1932 edition of the modernist "Architectural Review".
From today's viewpoint the theatre, now called the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, is regarded as a "nationally significant building" representing the "best modern municipal style of architecture". It was made a listed building on 14 October 1980.
Later practice.
Scott was joined in the partnership by John Breakwell and—as John Shepherd and Alison Sleigh had married—the practice became "Scott, Shepherd and Breakwell". None of their subsequent commissions had the prominence of the SMT, although their 1938 work on the Fawcett Building at Newnham College, Cambridge, is of note. In the post-war period Scott returned to Bournemouth, working with the practice of Ronald Phillips & Partners. In the 1960s she joined the public sector, working for Bournemouth Borough Architect's Department on such projects as the new pavilion and theatre on Bournemouth Pier. These relatively mundane schemes were no reflection of Scott's early talent; largely forgotten, she was "unable to live up to her perceived early promise". She retired in 1968.
Feminism.
In 1924, when Scott entered practice, there were no prominent women architects and her selection for the project to rebuild the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre after it was destroyed by fire was only through her success in an international competition. Her achievement, and her decision to employ where possible women architects to assist her on the Stratford design, was instrumental in opening up the profession to women. Although Scott was identified with the progressive movement to overturn traditional assumptions about women and the professions, she was by nature more of a quiet and practical feminist, ensuring that women were represented on her design projects and working through the Fawcett Society to promote wider acceptance.
Family.
In 1936 she married George Richards. She died in Bournemouth on 19 June 1972.

Harold W. McGraw Prize in Education

The Harold W. McGraw Prize in Education is awarded annually by the McGraw-Hill Research Foundation to recognize outstanding individuals who have dedicated themselves to improving education in the United States. The Prize was established in 1988 to honor the company's founder, James H. McGraw's lifelong commitment to education and to mark the corporation's 100th anniversary.
It has been called the equivalent of a Nobel Prize in Education. There are, however, several important differences between the two Prizes. First, it is not based on a single research discovery but rather on the importance of an individual's career-long impact on the field of education. It is also, apparently, restricted to US citizens. A large, distinguished panel determines three annual winners covering pre-k and elementary, secondary, and post-secondary education. Each recipient receives a statue and US$50,000. Like the Nobel Prize, it is only awarded to living recipients. 
Past honorees include: 
former U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley;
former U.S. Secretary of Education Rod Paige; 
the Honorable James B. Hunt, Jr., former Governor of North Carolina; 
Ellen Moir, co-founder and executive director, New Teacher Center at the University of California, Santa Cruz;

Cerro Bolívar

Cerro Bolívar is a mountain in the state of Bolívar, Venezuela, about 600 metres high. It has been described as "the richest concentration of iron ore on the face of the earth." At the time of its discovery it promised to outdo the great Hull-Rust-Mahoning mine in Hibbing, Minnesota, USA. More than half the mountain is thought to consist of top-grade iron ore – anything up to half a billion tons.
Cerro Bolivar has been mined since the 1950s, being first mined by U.S. Steel. In 1975, the mining operation was nationalized by the government of president Carlos Andrés Pérez. Mining stopped in 1997, but resumed again in 2009 when the Swiss company Commodities and Minerals Ltd took over operations on invitation by president Hugo Chávez.

Clarel

Clarel: A Poem and Pilgrimage in the Holy Land (1876) is an epic poem by American writer Herman Melville, published in two volumes. "Clarel" is the longest poem in American literature, stretching to almost 18,000 lines (longer even than European classics such as the "Iliad", "Aeneid" and "Paradise Lost"). As well its great length, "Clarel" is notable for being the major work of Melville's later years.
Plot.
Part One: Jerusalem.
Clarel, a young theology student whose belief has begun to waver, travels to Jerusalem to renew his faith in the sites and scenes of Jesus Christ’s mortal ministry. He stays in a hostel run by Abdon, the Black Jew—a living representation of Jerusalem. Clarel is initially amazed by the religious diversity of Jerusalem; he sees Jews, Protestants, Catholics, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists walking its streets and recognizes their common faith in divinity. Clarel also senses a kinship with an Italian youth and Catholic doubter named Celio, whom he sees walking in the distance, but does not take the initiative and greet him. When Celio dies shortly thereafter, Clarel feels he may have passed up an opportunity to regain his faith.
While walking through Jerusalem’s streets, Clarel meets Nehemiah, a Christian who hands out proselytizing tracts to pilgrims and tourists. Nehemiah becomes Clarel’s guide and shows him the sights of Jerusalem. At the Wailing Wall, Clarel notices an American Jew and his daughter, whom he learns are Agar and Ruth. Nehemiah later introduces Clarel to Ruth, with whom he falls in love. But Jewish custom and a jealous rabbi keep Clarel and Ruth apart much of the time, so the student continues sightseeing with Nehemiah.
In Gethsemane, Clarel meets Vine and Rolfe, two opposites. Rolfe is a Protestant and religious skeptic who historicizes Jerusalem and calls into question Christ's claim to divinity. Vine is a quiet man whose example leads Clarel to hope for faith—at least initially. When Vine and Rolfe decide to take a tour of other important sites in the Holy Land—the wilderness where John the Baptist preached, the monastery at Mar Saba, and Bethlehem—Clarel wants to accompany them, but he does not wish to leave Ruth.
At this critical juncture, Ruth's father Nathan dies. As Jewish customs prohibit Clarel’s presence, so the student decides to take the journey, confident that he will see his beloved when he returns to Jerusalem. The night before his departure, he sees a frieze depicting the death of a young bride, which makes him pause with foreboding. He banishes his doubts and sets off on his pilgrimage.
Part Two: The Wilderness.
Clarel travels with a wide range of fellow pilgrims —Nehemiah, Rolfe and Vine accompany him, and Melville introduces new characters for this book: Djalea, son of an emir, turned tour guide; Belex, the leader of six armed guards protecting the pilgrimage; a Greek banker and his son-in-law Glaucon; a Lutheran minister named Derwent; an unnamed former elder who has lost the faith; and a Swedish Jew named Mortmain, whose black skull cap constantly forebodes ill. The tour through the desert starts with an explicit invitation to compare Clarel and his companions’ journey to “brave Chaucer’s” pilgrims to Canterbury.
Unaccustomed to desert hardships, the banker and his son-in-law soon abandon the group for a caravan headed back to Jerusalem. When Clarel and his companions come to the stretch of road where Christ’s good Samaritan rescued a Jew from robbers, the taciturn elder also departs, scoffing at the cautions of Djalea and Belex, who fear robbers. Mortmain is the final deserter; he leaves before the party makes a stop at Jericho, refusing to enter a city he considers wicked. During their travels, Clarel’s party is joined by Margoth, an apostate Jewish geologist who scoffs at the faith expressed by Derwent, As an atheist, Margoth prompts Rolfe to move closer to Derwent’s faith than he had formerly been. The company also speaks briefly with a Dominican monk traveling through the desert.
In the absence of these travelers, Derwent and Rolfe engage in a number of heated debates as to the veracity of biblical accounts and the relationship between the various Protestant sects. Derwent staunchly maintains his faith in biblical accuracy, while Rolfe questions the Holy Book’s basis as factual history even as he acknowledges his desire to believe. Clarel eagerly listens to these conversations but rarely participates, unsure of whether his faith is being shored up or torn down by the debates. He seeks Vine out for companionship, but Vine’s stoic silence resists interpretation, and Vine denies Clarel’s request for more open talk.
When the party arrives at the Dead Sea, they make camp, and are rejoined by Mortmain. Seeming disturbed, he drinks the salty Dead Sea water despite warnings that it is poisonous. Mortmain survives but, when the pilgrims wake in the morning, they discover that Nehemiah has died in the night. He saw a vision of John’s heavenly city in the air, above the ruins of Sodom and Gomorrah. While the company buries the man by the Dead Sea, Clarel looks out over the water. He sees a faint rainbow, which seems to offer hope as it did for Noah, but the bow “showed half spent— / Hovered and trembled, paled away, and—went.”
Part Three: Mar Saba.
Clarel and the other pilgrims travel to the Greek Orthodox monastery of Mar Saba, where one St. Saba discovered a fountain in the desert and planted a palm tree now more than one thousand years old. On their way to the monastery, they meet a young man from Cyprus who has just left Mar Saba and is traveling to the Dead Sea. The Cypriot's faith is unshaken, and all who hear his singing envy him. On their way to Mar Saba, the travelers pass through the “tents of Kedar,” where a band of robbers camp and exact a toll of travelers to the monastery. These robbers recognize Arab royalty in Djalea, however, and let the pilgrims pass without molesting them.
At Mar Saba, Clarel and his friends are fed by the monks and entertained with a masque portraying the story of Cataphilus, a wandering Jew. Hearing Cataphilus described as having lost his faith “and meriteth no ruth,” Clarel thinks he resembles the Jew. The monks leave the group with Lesbos, a Muslim merchant visiting the monastery. Lesbos leads the group in a drunken revel, persuading even the staid Derwent to participate. He also introduces the group to Agath, another visitor at Mar Saba, a Greek sailor who was sent to Mar Saba to recover after being attacked in the Judean desert, similarly to the wounded Jew in Christ’s parable of the Good Samaritan. Reminiscent of Melville's novels such as "White-Jacket" and "Moby-Dick", Agath and Lesbos tell several sea stories to Clarel, who listens attentively to the tales.
In conversations among the pilgrims and monks, Clarel learns that no one has faith—not Vine, Rolfe, Belex, Lesbos—nor Derwent, whose professions until this point had been staunch. After confessing his lack of faith to Clarel, Derwent takes a tour of the monastery. He cannot appreciate the monks’ faith; he scoffs at the holy relics showed him by the abbot, considers several of the monks to be insane, and cannot believe that the holy palm tree is either holy or a thousand years old. When he takes his eyes from the palm, Derwent sees Mortmain’s skull cap flutter down from an outcropping where the Jew is observing the palm.
All of the pilgrims fall asleep looking at the palm tree. In the morning, when the caravan is about to leave, Mortmain is missing. They find him on the outcropping, his glassy, dead eyes fixed on the palm tree. The monks bury the Jew outside the monastery, in an unconsecrated grave, “Where vulture unto vulture calls, / And only ill things find a friend.”
Part Four: Bethlehem.
When the pilgrims leave Mar Saba, they take Lesbos and Agath with them. After a short distance, Lesbos turns back and returns to the monastery,giving the pilgrims a military salute. Ungar, a new traveling companion, joins the company. A veteran of the American Civil War, he is descended from Catholic colonists and American Indians, and is the only one among them with faith. This new group travels to Bethlehem together. Once in Bethlehem, Agath leaves to join a new caravan. The remaining pilgrims pay Djaleal and Belex for their services in guiding them through the desert.
Ungar’s faith attracts Clarel. Derwent is antagonized by his insistence that man is "fallen" and cannot reclaim his lost glory without divine aid. Their debates over human nature and religion reach to the morality of democracy and capitalism. Vine, Rolfe and Clarel, all Americans, take Ungar’s part, leaving the Englishman to believe that they argue with him out of prejudice against the Old World.
In Bethlehem, the group is shown the cave where Christ was born by a young Franciscan monk named Salvaterra (save the earth in Italian). He seems almost divine to them, as if he were a reincarnation of St. Francis. The monk inspires Clarel’s faith. Clarel’s faith is strengthened after his time with Ungar and Salvaterra, and he views the setting sun as an inspiring beacon.
Ungar leaves the group and Salvaterra remains in the monastery, leaving Clarel to grapple alone with his fledgling faith. He returns to Jerusalem hopeful, eager to rescue Ruth and Agar from their exile in Palestine, and return with them both to the United States. As Clarel approaches Jerusalem during the night before Ash Wednesday, he meets a Jewish burial party. In his absence, Ruth and Agar have died. His newfound faith is rocked to its depths. All through the rituals of Holy Week, Clarel waits for a miracle: for Ruth to return from the dead as Christ did. But Easter passes without Ruth’s resurrection. Clarel is left a lone man in Jerusalem, wondering why, though “They wire the world—far under sea / They talk; but never comes to me / A message from beneath the stone.”
The last canto of "Clarel", the epilogue, offers Melville’s commentary on the existential crisis of faith suffered by Clarel in the wake of Ruth’s death. Though Clarel remains beset by troubles and doubts, Melville offers the poem as an exordium to faith:
 "Then keep thy heart, though yet but ill-resigned—<br>
Clarel, thy heart, the issues there but mind;<br>
That like the crocus budding through the snow—<br>
That like a swimmer rising from the deep—<br>
That like a burning secret which doth go<br>
Even from the bosom that would hoard and keep;<br>
Emerge thou mayst from the last whelming sea,<br>
And prove that death but routs life into victory."
Origins.
Melville had visited the Holy Land in the winter of 1856, and traveled along the route he describes in "Clarel". The visit followed a trip to England on October of the same year, in which he met his friend Nathaniel Hawthorne, who was working there. Melville gave Hawthorne his manuscript for "The Confidence Man", which essentially amounted to his 'farewell to prose.' Hawthorne later recorded his concern about Melville, noting how they
"took a pretty long walk together, and sat down in the hollow among the sand hills (sheltering ourselves from the high, cool wind) and smoked a cigar. Melville, as he always does, began to reason of Providence and futurity, and of everything that lies beyond human ken, and informed me that he had "pretty much made up his mind to be annihilated"; but still he does not seem to rest in that anticipation; and, I think, will never rest until he gets hold of a definite belief. It is strange how he persists -- and has persisted ever since I knew him, and probably long before -- in wandering to and fro over these deserts, as dismal and monotonous as the sand hills amid which we were sitting. He can neither believe, nor be comfortable in his unbelief; and he is too honest and courageous not to try to do one or the other."
"Journal of a Visit to Europe and the Levant", Melville's record of the winter voyage of 1856 (which took him five months and 15,000 miles), demonstrates that he did not leave behind his doubts or melancholy. Sailing through the Greek Islands, he became disillusioned with classical mythology. He was still in doubt following his time in Jerusalem. Passing Cyprus on the way home, he wrote: "From these waters rose Venus from the foam. Found it as hard to realize such a thing as to realize on Mt Olivet that from there Christ rose." (p. 164)
Melville explored the divide between the preternatural, the religious, and historical reality; he also was influenced by the crisis faced by mid-19th century Christianity in the wake of the discoveries of Charles Darwin. Melville saw these scientific developments as simultaneously fascinating (cf. the focus on natural history in "Moby-Dick") and terrifying, representing a challenge to traditional Christianity that was almost apocalyptic in its significance, especially when combined with the more theological attacks of Protestantism. As he writes in the troubled, and inconclusive, Epilogue to "Clarel":
If Luther's day expand to Darwin's year,
Should that exclude the hope -- foreclose the fear?
Form.
The poem is composed in irregularly rhymed iambic tetrameter (except for the "Epilogue"), and contains 150 Cantos divided into four books: "Jerusalem", "The Wilderness", "Mar Saba", and "Bethlehem".
Trying to determine the strange appeal of the work's "detuned poetic style", William C. Spengeman has suggested that the "impacted tetrameters of "Clarel"" reveal the origin of the "modernist note", and that they thus anticipate the "prosody of Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot and William Carlos Williams".
Similarly, Walter E. Bezanson notes the "curious mixture of the archaic and the contemporary both in language and materials", leading to the inclusion of antique words such as "kern, scrip, carl, tilth and caitiff", alongside modern technical terms taken "from ship and factory, from the laboratory, from trading, seafaring, and war." Commenting on the rhyme-scheme and the restricted meter, Bezanson responded to the common objection that Melville ought to have composed the work in prose, or at least in blank verse, arguing:
To wish that "Clarel" had been written in blank verse, for example, is simply to wish for a completely different poem. In earlier years Melville had often set Shakespearean rhythms echoing through his high-keyed prose with extraordinary effect. But now the bravura mood was gone. Melville did not propose a broad heroic drama in the Elizabethan manner. Pentameter -- especially blank verse -- was too ample and overflowing for his present mood and theme. "The tragedy of modern man, as Melville now viewed it, was one of constriction"... Variations from the basic prosodic pattern are so infrequent as to keep the movement along an insistently narrow corridor.
Reception.
Contemporary.
The poem was barely noticed on its original publication, and the few reviews that did appear showed that mainstream critical taste in the States leant towards the polished, genteel lines of poets such as Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and James Russell Lowell. The "New York Times" was the first to insist that "it should have been written in prose," while the reviewer for the "World" complained that he had got "lost in the overwhelming tide of mediocrity." The "Independent" called it a "vast work... destitute of interest or metrical skill," and "Lippincott's Magazine" claimed that there were "not six lines of genuine poetry in it." In his collection of these quotes, Walter E. Bezanson suggests that the overwhelmingly negative response was partly due to the fact that none of the critics had "actually read it," noting in particular the "Lippincott" critic's baffling comment that the poet was evidently a "bright and genial" individual, an observation entirely out of keeping with the tone of the vast majority of the work.
Early 20th century.
Subsequent criticism, especially since the so-called "Melville Revival" of the early-20s, has been more positive about the poem. Frank Jewett Mather called it the "America's best example of Victorian faith-doubt literature", and Raymond Weaver declared that it contained "more irony, vividness and intellect than almost all the contemporary poets put together." In 1924, amid the rising tide of literary modernism, the British critic John Middleton Murry approvingly noted the "compressed and craggy" quality of Melville's poetic line, and the French critic Jean Simon called the work "an extraordinary revelation of a tormented soul."
Post World War II.
Seeing the whole work as an obscure elder sibling to T. S. Eliot's "The Waste Land", literary scholar, Richard Chase has argued that the "sterility of modern life is the central symbolic idea of the poem," and that, after the "extremities of titanism in """, Melville reached the culmination of his later thought: "the core of the high Promethean hero." These remarks paved the way for a generation of critics who saw the poem as the crucial document of Melville's later years, such as Ronald Mason, who reads the poem as "a contemplative recapitulation of all Melville's imaginative life," and Newton Arvin, who calls it "Melville's great novel of ideas in verse."
In 1994, Harold Bloom chose "Clarel" as one of four Melville works to be included in his book, "The Western Canon."

Nabesna Road

The Nabesna Road is a minor highway in the U.S. state of Alaska that extends from the Slana River to Nabesna, providing access to some interior components of Wrangell-St. Elias National Park. The entire length of the road is gravel and has few services. Flat tires and washouts are fairly common along the entire length of the road. 
Route description.
Today, the Alaska Department of Transportation maintains the Nabesna Road and, generally, the road is passable by most two-wheel drive vehicles. However, higher clearance and/or four-wheel drive are occasionally needed beyond Mile 29 due to stream crossings. Wet conditions such as spring run-off and heavy rain can make these stream crossings impassable. The maintained portion of the road ends at a private hunting lodge at mile 42. The last four miles (6 km) of the road are not maintained and may be deeply rutted and wet. Vehicle travel on this portion of the road is not recommended.
The Slana Roadhouse, a historic site dating to 1928, is located on Nabesna Road in Slana.
Motorists may stop at the Slana Ranger Station, mile .5, to check current road conditions and to pick up a Nabesna Road Guide brochure.
History.
The Nabesna Road was originally built in 1933 by the Alaska Road Commission to supply Nabesna Mine and to ship out its ore.

T-type calcium channel

T-type calcium channels are low-voltage activated calcium channels that open during membrane depolarization. These channels aid in mediating calcium influx into cells after an action potential or depolarizing signal. The entry of calcium into various cells has many different physiological responses associated with it. Within cardiac and smooth muscle cells voltage-gated calcium channel activation initiates contraction directly by allowing the cytosolic calcium concentration to increase. Not only are T-type calcium channels known to be present within cardiac and smooth muscle, but also are present in many neuronal cells within the central nervous system. Different experimental studies within the 1970s allowed for the distinction of T-type calcium channels (transient opening calcium channels) from the already well-known L-type calcium channels (low-voltage opening calcium channels). The new T-type channels were much different from the L-type calcium channels due to their ability to be activated by more negative membrane potentials, had small single channel conductance, and also were unresponsive to calcium antagonist drugs that were present. These distinct calcium channels are generally located within the brain, peripheral nervous system, heart, smooth muscle, bone, and endocrine system.
The distinct structures of T-type calcium channels are what allow them to conduct in these manners, consisting of a primary α1 subunit. The α1 subunit of T-type channels is the primary subunit that forms the pore of the channel, and allows for entry of calcium.
T-type calcium channels function to control the pace-making activity of the SA Node within the heart and relay rapid action potentials within the thalamus. These channels allow for continuous rhythmic bursts that control the SA Node of the heart.
Pharmacological evidence of T-type calcium channels suggest that they play a key role in diseases such as absence epilepsy, diabetes, and several forms of cancer. Further research is continuously occurring to better understand these distinct channels, as well as create drugs to select for these channels.
Function.
Like any other channel in a cell membrane, the primary function of the T-type voltage gated calcium channel is to allow passage of ions, in this case calcium, through the membrane when the channel is activated. When membrane depolarization occurs in a cell membrane where these channels are embedded, they open and allow calcium to enter the cell, which leads to several different cellular events depending on where in the body the cell is found. As a member of the Cav3 subfamily of voltage-gated calcium channels, the function of the T-type channel is important for the repetitive firing of action potentials in cells with rhythmic firing patterns such as cardiac muscle cells and neurons in the thalamus of the brain. T-type calcium channels are activated in the same range as voltage-gated sodium channels, which is at about -55 mV. Because of this very negative value at which these channels are active, there is a large driving force for calcium going into the cell. The T-type channel is regulated by both dopamine and other neurotransmitters, which inhibit T-type currents. Additionally, in certain cells angiotensin II enhances the activation of T-type channels.
Heart.
This is important in the aforementioned depolarization events in the pace-making activity of the sinoatrial (SA) Node in the heart and in the neuron relays of the thalamus so that quick transmission of action potentials can occur. This is very important for the heart when stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system that causes the heart rate to increase, in that not only does the T-type calcium channel provide an extra depolarization punch in addition to the voltage gated sodium channels to cause a stronger depolarization, but it also helps provide a quicker depolarization of the cardiac cells.
Fast-acting.
Another important facet of the T-type voltage gated calcium channel is its fast voltage-dependent inactivation compared to that of other calcium channels. Therefore, while they helped provide stronger and quicker depolarization of cardiac muscle cells and thalamus nerve cells, T-type channels also allow for more frequent depolarization events. This is very important in the heart in the simple fact that the heart is better apt to increase its rate of firing when stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system innervating its tissues. Although all of these functions of the T-type voltage gated calcium channel are important, quite possibly the most important of its functions is its ability to generate potentials that allow for rhythmic bursts of action potentials in cardiac cells of the sinoatrial node of the heart and in the thalamus of the brain. Because the T-type channels are voltage dependent, hyperpolarization of the cell past its inactivation voltage will close the channels throughout the SA node, and allow for another depolarizing event to occur. The voltage dependency of the T-type channel contributes to the rhythmic beating of the heart.
Structure.
Voltage-gated calcium channels are made up of several subunits. The α1 subunit is the primary subunit that forms the transmembrane pore of the channel. The α1 subunit also determines the type of calcium channel. The β, α2δ, and γ subunits, present in only some types of calcium channels, are auxiliary subunits that play secondary roles in the channel.
α1 Subunit.
The α1 subunit of T-type calcium channels is similar in structure to the α subunits of K+(potassium ion) channels, Na+(sodium ion) channels, and other Ca2+(calcium ion) channels. The α1 subunit is composed of four domains (I-IV), with each domain containing 6 transmembrane segments (S1-S6). The hydrophobic loops between the S5 and S6 segments of each domain form the pore of the channel. The S4 segment contains a high quantity of positively charged residues and functions as the voltage sensor of the channel opening or closing based on the membrane potential. The exact method by which the S4 segment controls the opening and closing of the channel is currently unknown.
Auxiliary subunits.
The β, α2δ, and γ subunits are auxiliary subunits that affect channel properties in some calcium channels. The α2δ subunit is a dimer with an extracellular α2 portion linked to a transmembrane δ portion. The β subunit is an intracellular membrane protein. The α2δ and β subunits have an effect on the conductance and kinetics of the channel. The γ subunit is a membrane protein that has an effect on the voltage sensitivity of the channel. Current evidence shows that isolated T-type α1 subunits have similar behavior to natural T-type channels, suggesting that the β, α2δ, and γ subunits are absent from T-type calcium channels and the channels are made up of only an α1 subunit.
Variation.
There are three known types of T-type calcium channels, each associated with a specific α1 subunit.
Pharmacology.
T-type calcium channels are involved in diseases such as absence epilepsy, diabetes, and several forms of cancer.
Improper function.
When these channels are not functioning correctly, or are absent from their usual domains, several issues can result. The major disease that involves the T-type calcium channel is absence epilepsy. This disease is caused by mutations of T-type calcium channel itself. When an individual has this disease, they will move in and out of a sleep-like state, even during normal activities.
Absence epilepsy.
Experiments on the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat of Strasbourg (GAERS) suggested that absence epilepsy in the rat was linked to T-type channel protein expression. In fact, neurons isolated from the reticular nucleus of the thalamus of the GAERS showed 55% greater T-type currents, and these currents were attributed to an increase in the Cav3.2 mRNA, according to Tally et al. suggesting that T-type protein expression was up regulated in the GAERS. Further experiments on the GAERS showed that, indeed, the expression of T-type calcium channels play a key role in seizures caused by absence epilepsy in the GAERS. Also, other evidence suggest that T-type calcium channel expression is not only up regulated in absence epilepsy, but also in other forms of epilepsy as well.
Cancer.
T-type Calcium channels are expressed in different human cancers such as breast, colon, prostate, insulinoma, retinoblastoma, leukemia, ovarian, and melanoma, and they also play key roles in proliferation, survival, and the regulation of cell cycle progression in these forms of cancer . This was demonstrated through studies that showed that down regulating T-type channel isoforms, or just blocking the T-type calcium channels caused cytostatic effects in cancer cells such as gliomas, breast, melanomas, and ovarian, esophageal, and colorectal cancers . 
Some of the most notorious forms of cancer tumors contain cancer stem cells (CSC), which makes them particularly resistant to any cancer therapy . Furthermore, there is evidence that suggests that the presence of the CSC in human tumors may be associated with the expression of T-type calcium channels in the tumors.
Diabetes.
The Cav3.2 isoform of T-type calcium channels has been found to cause neuropathic pain in animal models with peripheral diabetic neuropathy (PDN) . Actually, the Cav3.2 isoform of T-type calcium channels enhances excitability of nociceptors in animals with type 1 or 2 PDN . As a result, this enhanced excitability causes neuropathic pain.
Current research.
Studies have shown that calcium channel blockers (CCB) such as mibefradil can also block L-type calcium channels, other enzymes, as well as other channels. Consequently, research is still being conducted to design highly selective drugs that can target T-type calcium channels alone. 
Furthermore, since T-type calcium channels are involved in proliferation, survival and cell cycle progression of these cells, they are potential targets for anticancer therapy. Like mentioned above, blockage or down regulation of the T-type calcium channels causes cytostasis in tumors; but this blockage or down regulation of the T-channels may also induce cytotoxic effects. Consequently, it is not yet clear what the benefits or disadvantages of targeting T-type calcium channels in anticancer therapy are. On the other hand, a combined therapy involving administration of a T-type channel antagonist followed by cytotoxic therapy is currently in its clinical trial phase. 
In addition, drugs that target the CaV3.2 isoform (responsible for development of neuropathic pain in PDN) are associated with serious side effects. As a result, research to improve or design new drugs is currently on-going.

Maskirovka

Maskirovka is a Russian word ("Маскировка") pertaining to the business of military deception. Although the word is sometimes translated as 'camouflage', this belies its much broader meaning that includes all measures, active and passive, designed to deceive the enemy, which includes: concealment ("skrytie"), imitation using decoys and military dummies ("imitasiia"), manoeuvres intended to deceive ("demonstrativnye manevry") and disinformation ("dezinformatsiia")
The "Soviet Military Encyclopeadia" defines "maskirovka" thus: 
 'The means of securing combat operations and the daily activities of forces; a complexity of measures, directed to mislead the enemy regarding the presence and disposition of forces, various military objectives, their condition, combat readiness and operations, and also the plans of the commander ... "maskirovka" contributes to the achievement of surprise for the actions of forces, the preservation of combat readiness and the increased survivability of objectives.' 
It was developed as a military doctrine in the 1920s, and used by Zhukov in the 1939 Battles of Khalkhin Gol against Japan. For example the "Field Regulations of the Red Army" (1929) stated that "Surprise has a stunning effect on the enemy. For this reason all troop operations must be accomplished with the greatest concealment and speed." Concealment was to be attained by confusing the enemy with movements, camouflage and use of terrain, speed, use of night and fog, and secrecy. 
"Maskirovka" was put into practice on a large scale in the Battle of Kursk, especially on the Steppe Front commanded by Ivan Konev. The result was that the Germans attacked Russian forces four times stronger than they were expecting. The German general Friedrich von Mellenthin wrote "The horrible counter-attacks, in which huge masses of manpower and equipment took part, were an unpleasant surprise for us... The most clever camouflage of the Russians should be emphasized again. We did not .. detect even one minefield or anti-tank area until .. the first tank was blown up by a mine or the first Russian anti-tank guns opened fire".
Operation Bagration is another often cited example of "maskirovka" on a grand scale.
It continued to be a vital element of Soviet military doctrine during the cold war.

R-type calcium channel

The R-type calcium channel is a type of voltage-dependent calcium channel. Like the others of this class, the α1 subunit forms the pore through which calcium enters the cell and determines most of the channel's properties. This α1 subunit is also known as the calcium channel, voltage-dependent, R type, alpha 1E subunit (CACNA1E) or Cav2.3 which in humans is encoded by the "CACNA1E" gene.
They are strongly expressed in cortex, hippocampus, striatum, amygdala and interpeduncular nucleus. 
They are poorly understood, but like Q-type calcium channels, they appear to be present in cerebellar granule cells. They have a high threshold of activation and relatively slow kinetics.

P-type calcium channel

The P-type calcium channel is a type of voltage-dependent calcium channel. Similar to many other high-voltage-gated calcium channels, the α1 subunit determines most of the channel's properties. The 'P' signifies cerebellar Purkinje cells, referring to the channels initial site of discovery. P-type calcium channels play a similar role to the N-type calcium channel in neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic terminal and in neuronal integration in many neuronal types.
History.
The calcium channel experiments that led to the discovery of P-type calcium channels were initially completed by Llinás and Sugimori in 1980. P type calcium channels were named in 1989 because they were discovered within mammalian Purkinje neurons. They were able to use an "in vitro" preparation to examine the ionic currents that account for Purkinje cells' electrophysiological properties. They found that there are calcium dependent action potentials which rise slowly and fall quickly then undergo hyperpolarization. The action potentials were voltage dependent and the afterhyperpolarizing potentials were connected to the spike bursts, located within the dendrites of the Purkinje cells. Without calcium flux in the Purkinje cells, action potentials fire sporadically at a high frequency.
Basic features and structure.
P-type calcium channels are voltage dependent calcium channels that are classified under the high voltage activated class channel, along with L-, N-, Q- and R-type channels. These channels require a strong depolarization in order to be activated. They are found at axon terminals, as well as in somatodendritic areas of neurons within the central and peripheral nervous system. P-type calcium channels are also critical to vesicle release, specifically neurotransmitters and hormones at synaptic terminals of excitatory and inhibitory synapses.
Voltage gated P-type calcium channels consist of a main pore-forming α1 subunit (which is more specifically referred to as CaV2.1), an α2 subunit and a β subunit. There can be γ subunits found in calcium channels of skeletal muscles. The α1 subunit is encoded specifically by the CACNA1A gene and is composed of four domains, each containing six transmembrane (S1-S6) spanning α helices. The S1-S2 loop and the S6 region are thought to be responsible for the channel's inactivation, the S4 region serves as the voltage sensor and S5-S6 loop forms the pore. There are seven subunits within the α1 subunit. The A subunit, called α1ACa2+, corresponds to what is functionally defined as the P-type and Q-type isoforms. P-type and Q-type calcium channels are closely related as they are produced from the same gene via alternative splicing. As a complication of the alternative splicing, P-type and Q-type channels may have different subunit compositions. The β subunit regulates the kinetics and expression of the channel, along with the α2δ subunit.
Channel distribution.
Areas of high expression in mammalian systems include:
Channel blockers.
P-type calcium channel blockers act to impede the flow of calcium. The blocking of calcium currents may cause the organism to experience impaired functioning and viability. These effects can lead to various diseases which are described in more detail in the section below. 
The pore of P-type calcium channels are sensitive to compounds that can be divided into three groups:
There are only two peptide toxins that selectively block P-type channels: ω-agatoxin IVA and ω-agatoxin IVB. The other blockers mentioned, such as the low molecular weight and therapeutic blockers, are nonselective. This means they act can act on P-type channels as well as other channels.
Selective peptide toxin ω-agatoxin.
The two known blockers which are specific to P-type calcium channels are peptides derived from the spider venom of "Agelenopsis aperta". The toxins from this venom which show selectivity for P-type channels are ω-agatoxin IVA and ω-agatoxin IVB. Each of these peptide toxins are made of 48 amino acids which are bound by four disulfide bonds. Although ω-agatoxin IVA and ω-agatoxin IVB have the same affinity and selectivity for P-type channels, their kinetics are different. The ω-agatoxin IVA effects the gating mechanism of the P-type channel. When there is a strong depolarization to activate the channel, ω-agatoxin IVA can no longer block the channel. Therefore, ω-agatoxin IVA has a very low affinity for the channel when it is open. It binds to the α1A subunit on the outside of the pore. The ω-agatoxin IVA receptor on the P-type channel is located at the S3-S4 linker. On the other hand, channel blocking by ω-agatoxin IVB occurs much more slowly. Yet, similar to ω-agatoxin IVA, ω-agatoxin IVB cannot bind to the channel upon a strong depolarization.
Low molecular weight P-type channel blockers.
Low molecular weight channel blockers have advantages over peptide blockers in drug development. One advantage of low molecular weight channel blockers is that they can penetrate tissue, which is important for crossing the blood-brain barrier. There is no specific low molecular weight channel blocker for P-type channels. However,there are a number of these blocker compounds which can effect the activity of the P-type channels. These include:
Therapeutics.
There are therapeutics used clinically which can effect the activity of P-type calcium channels. However, the primary target of these therapeutics are not thought to be P-type channels. For example, calcium antagonists, which are used to treat coronary heart disease, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmia, act by inhibiting L-type or T-type calcium channels. Some of these calcium antagonists include verapamil, diltiazem, amlodipine, benidipine, cilnidipine, nicardipine, and barnidipine. Although their main target is not P-type channels, these calcium antagonists also act to block the function of P-type channels. Moreover, flunarizine is another calcium antagonist which is used to treat migraines. Its main targets are voltage-gated calcium channels and sodium channels. Flunarizine inhibits the P-type channels that are located in the neocortical slices. It works to inhibit the inward flux of calcium. The migraines that it helps to prevent are due to mutations within the "cacna1a" gene of the P-type channel subunit. Also, compounds that block P-type channels are shown to help with seizures. Epileptic seizures are caused by increased neurotransmission, which is partially a result of P-type channels. Compounds such as levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine are known to block the P-type channels, which have helped to decrease the occurrence of seizures. Overall, there are various non-selective calcium channel blockers that help alleviate symptoms of hypertension, schizophrenia, cardiac arrhythmia, epilepsy, pain, asthma, bradycardia, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease. Although many of the therapeutic compounds' main target is not P-type channels, further research needs to determine if the clinical effects of these compounds are also influenced by the P-type channel blockage.
Related diseases.
There are a number of neurological diseases that have been attributed to malfunctioning or mutated P/Q type channels.
Alzheimer's disease.
In Alzheimer Disease, there is a progressive accumulation of β-amyloid protein (Aβ) in brain. Amyloid plaques develop which result in the key symptoms of Alzheimer Disease. Aβ globulomer protein is an artificial substance used in research experiments that has similar properties to Aβ oligomer which is present in the body. Aβ oligomer directly regulates P/Q type calcium channels. The α1A subunit is the responsible for the conduction of calcium current. When only P/Q type calcium channels are present with Aβ globulomer protein, there is a direct effect on the α1A subunit and results in an increased calcium current through the P/Q type calcium channel. The response is dose dependent as concentrations of 20nM and 200nM of Aβ globulomer are necessary for significant increase of calcium current through channel in Xenopus oocytes, showing that a certain build up of Aβ globulomer is necessary before the effects are seen. When the calcium current is increased, neurotransmitter release also rises, offering a possible cause for the toxicity in Alzheimer Disease patients.
Migraine headaches.
The CACNA1A gene codes for the alpha subunit of the P/Q type calcium channel. The R192Q mutation of the CACNA1A gene is a gain of function mutation for P2X3 receptors. P2X3 receptors are present in trigeminal ganglion neurons and are believed to be a main contributor to familial hemiplegic migraine. By using a knockin experiment, this mutation could be expressed in mice so research could be conducted. The mutant mouse has a significantly higher P2X3 receptor activity than the wild type mouse due to increased channel open probability and channel activation at lower voltages. This increased receptor activity results in a higher flux of calcium through the P/Q type calcium channel. The increased intracellular calcium concentration may contribute to the acute trigeminal pain that typically results in a headache. Evidence supports that migraines are a disorder of brain excitability characterized by deficient regulation of the cortical excitatory–inhibitory balance.
Seizures.
Levetiracetam is an anti-epileptic drug than can be used to treat partial and generalized seizures. Levetiracetam inhibits the release of glutamate from P/Q type calcium channels and decreases the excitatory post synaptic currents of both AMPA and NMDA receptors in the hippocampus, specifically the dentate gyrus, which is known to propagate seizure activities. The inhibition of glutamate release results in an anti-epileptic response in patients because it decreases the excitatory postsynaptic current. There are many different types of calcium channels, so to prove that the P/Q type calcium channels are directly involved, a P/Q type voltage gated calcium channel inhibitor, omega-agatoxin TK, was used to block the channel. When blocked, patients no longer benefited from the anti-epileptic effects from the drugs. When blockers for L type and N type calcium channels were used, the effects of Levetiracetam were still seen. This is strong evidence that the P/Q type calcium channels are involved in the Levetiracetam treatment which allow for relief from seizures.
Mutation studies.
Many P-type calcium channels mutations result in a decreased level of intracellular free calcium. Maintaining calcium homeostasis is essential for normally functioning neurons. Changing the cellular calcium ion concentration acts as a trigger for multiple diseases, in severe cases these diseases can result in mass neuronal death.
Mutation studies allow experimenters to study genetically inherited channelopathies. A channelopathy is any disease that results from an ion channel with malfunctioning subunits or regulatory proteins. One example of a P-type calcium channel channelopathy is shown in homozygous ataxic mice, who are recessive for both the "tottering" and "leaner" genes. These mice present with mutations in the alpha1A subunit of their P/Q type channels. Mutations in these channels result in deficiencies within the cerebellar Purkinje cells that dramatically reduce the channels current density. 
The tottering mutations within mice result from a missense mutation and causes delayed-onset of seizures and ataxia. The "tottering" mutation substitutes a single proline instead of a leucine within the P-region of the channel. The P-region is responsible for the formation of the ion channel pore. The "leaner" mutation, which results in more severe symptoms than the "tottering" mutation, has been shown to result from a single nucleotide substitution that causes splicing failures within the channels open reading frame. Mutations in the pore forming subunit of P type calcium channels cause ataxia, severely altered respiration, by decreasing minute ventilation and producing symptoms associated with atelectasis. Mutations to CaV2.1 have also been shown to affect transmission within the pre-Bötzinger Complex, a cluster of interneurons in the brainstem which help to regulate breathing.

N-type calcium channel

The N-type calcium channel is a type of voltage-dependent calcium channel. As with other sub-types of voltage-gated calcium channel, the α1 subunit forms the pore through which calcium enters the cell and determines most of the channel's properties. The α1 subunit is also known as the calcium channel, voltage-dependent, N type, alpha 1B subunit (CACNA1B) or Cav2.2 which in humans is encoded by the "CACNA1B" gene.
Structure.
In addition to the α1 subunit, the following subunits are present in the N-type calcium channel:
Function.
N-type ('N' for "Neural-Type" ) calcium channels are found primarily at presynaptic terminals and are involved in neurotransmitter release. Strong depolarization by an action potential causes these channels to open and allow influx of Ca2+, initiating vesicle fusion and release of stored neurotransmitter. N-type channels are blocked by ω-conotoxin.
Therapeutic Potential.
Blockade of the N-type calcium channel is a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of alcoholism. It is also used to treat certain types of pain.

<doc id="9773358" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9773358" title="L-type calcium channel">
L-type calcium channel

The L-type calcium channel (also known as the DHP receptor) is a type of voltage-dependent calcium channel. "L" stands for long-lasting referring to the length of activation. 
L-type calcium channels are responsible for excitation-contraction coupling of skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscle and for hormone secretion in cells in endocrine glands.
This channel lets L-type calcium current go through it. This current can be seen in Phase 2 of the action potential of atrial, ventricular and Purkinje fibers. This is a slow inward current that is opposed by K current going outside. 
As with other sub-types of voltage-gated calcium channel, the α1 subunit is the one that determines most of the channel's properties.
L-type calcium channel blocker drugs are used as cardiac antiarrhythmics or antihypertensives, depending on whether the drugs have higher affinity for the heart (the phenylalkylamines, like verapamil), or for the vessels (the dihydropyridines, like nifedipine).
In skeletal muscle, there is a very high concentration of L-type calcium channels, situated in
the T-tubules. Muscle depolarization results in large gating
currents, but anomalously low calcium flux, which is now
explained by the very slow activation of the ionic currents. For
this reason, little or no Ca2+ passes across the T-tubule
membrane during a single action potential.

Brown's Hotel

Brown's Hotel is a luxury 5-star hotel in London, United Kingdom. Opened in 1837, it is one of London's most established hotels, celebrating its 175th anniversary in 2012. Brown's has been owned by The Rocco Forte Collection since 3 July 2003 and is a member of The Leading Hotels of the World.
Brown's Hotel is set in the heart of Mayfair on Albemarle Street. It is located within walking distance of shopping streets such as Bond Street and Regent Street in addition to theatres, art galleries and central London landmarks. It also is in walking distance of Green Park and Hyde Park.
History.
Brown's Hotel was founded in 1837, by James and Sarah Brown.
In 1889, Brown's Hotel purchased St George's Hotel in Albemarle Street, which backed on to Brown's, and combined the two hotels, adding a fifth floor to both properties. On Albemarle Street, a new front of stucco and entrance portico were built, and two panels of blue and gold mosaic bearing the legend of Brown's and St George's were placed on the wall (both still exist today).
The hotel has hosted some notable people. Alexander Graham Bell went to stay in 1876 to demonstrate his new invention – the telephone – and the first successful telephone call in Great Britain was made from Brown's in 1876. The Niagara Room commemorates the meeting held there in 1890 by the "International Niagara Commission", which agreed on 'the adoption of electrical methods as the chief means of distributing Niagara power'; the inauguration of the alternating current system resulted and has subsequently been adopted throughout the world.
In 1886, Theodore Roosevelt stayed at Brown's prior to his second marriage. Royal guests have included Napoleon III and Empress Eugenie in 1871, Elizabeth, Queen of the Belgians (who took refuge in the hotel during World War I), Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia and George II, King of the Hellenes, who stayed at Brown's for nine years after his exile from Greece in 1924.
Other notable people who have stayed at Brown's include Cecil Rhodes, founder of Rhodesia, Rudyard Kipling (who completed "The Jungle Book" there) and Agatha Christie, who is popularly believed to have based her 1965 mystery "At Bertram's Hotel" on Brown's. However, the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography" says Christie's model was a different Mayfair hotel, Fleming's. Historian John Lothrop Motley stayed at the hotel in 1874, as shown in a letter he wrote on the 17th of June of that year, to Dutch historian Groen van Prinsterer. Celebrated Victorian writers Oscar Wilde, Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert Louis Stevenson, JM Barrie and Bram Stoker were also all regular visitors.
The hotel became part of the Rocco Forte collection of luxury hotels on 3 July 2003, having once been managed by Raffles International Hotels. During 2004–2005 the hotel underwent a £24 million refurbishment and re-opened in December 2005.
Interior.
The Brown's Hotel is noted for its traditional English Victorian sophistication fused with a contemporary feel. The bedrooms are designed by Olga Polizzi and combine modern features with traditional furnishing and are all individually decorated.

William Pryor Letchworth

William Pryor Letchworth (May 26, 1823 – December 1, 1910) was an American businessman notable for his charitable work.
Early years.
William was born in Brownville, New York on May 26, 1823, the fourth of eight children born to Josiah and Ann Hance Letchworth. Raised as a Quaker, Letchworth learned the values of hard work, charity, and development of the intellect from his family.
At age 15, Letchworh was hired as a clerk at Hayden & Holmes, a saddlery and hardware company. Letchworth succeeded at his tasks and in business in general, and by age 22 was partner at Pratt & Letchworth, a company involved in the "malleable iron" business.
Glen Iris Estate.
Although successful, Letchworth found the day-to-day operations of business burdensome. He sought refuge from the business world and decided to build a retreat estate. He settled on a location in former Seneca territory in western New York. They were pushed out of the area following the American Revolutionary War, as they had been allies of the defeated British. 
As a tourist, Letchworth visited the Sehgahunda Valley of the Genesee River in western New York. In 1859 he purchased his first tract of land near Portage Falls.
Letchworth hired noted landscape architect William Webster to design the grounds of the estate, and named it Glen Iris. In 1906 he bequeathed his estate to New York state. It now makes up the heart of Letchworth State Park.
Charity and social work.
In 1873, Letchworth was appointed to the New York State Board of Charities. "In 1875 he had inspected all the orphan asylums, poor-houses, city alms houses, and juvenile reformatories in the state which had an aggregate population of 17,791 children." Following his investigation, he recommended that all children under 2 years of age be removed from these institutions, which was accepted by the state. In 1878, Letchworth was elected as President of the Board. Letchworth resigned from the State Board of Charities in 1897. 
He spent the next few years traveling around Europe and the United States at his own expense to explore the treatment and condition of the insane, epileptics and poor children. From this research, he wrote two books: "The Insane in Foreign Countries" and "Care and Treatment of Epileptics". Many of his recommendations were later adopted by Craig Colony, a state epileptic hospital which he helped to establish in Western New York in 1896.
He served as President for the National Association for the Study of Epilepsy and the Care of Treatment of Epilepsy, and as President of the First New York State Conference of Charities and Corrections, as well as President of the National Conference of Charities and Correction, held in St. Louis in 1884.

Cathy Small

Cathy Small is professor and graduate coordinator of anthropology at Northern Arizona University, and has written under the pen name of Rebekah Nathan. During a leave of absence from teaching, during the fall of 2002 at the age of 52 she enrolled as a student at Northern Arizona University, signing up for a standard first year range of courses.After teaching for more than fifteen years, she realized that she no longer understood the behavior and attitudes of her students. As fewer people participated in class discussions or had decided not to discuss problems during her office hours. Her contributions to anthropology have focused on understanding long-term social change including the rise and fall of social institutions, the long-term implications of social structures, and the processes by which culture changes. Her work is characterized by a critical empathetic feminism, reflexivity, and a creative re-adaptation of focus: From Tonga to computer simulations of gender in Polynesian hierarchies, to U.S. college life.In 1997, Dr. Cathy Small was awarded a National Science Foundation grant for 1998 and 1999 to model and simulate Polynesian social systems.It was the publication of her ethnography of American university student life under the pen name 'Rebekah Nathan', and the ensuing discussions of ethnographic ethics, for which she has most received attention.
Biography.
She was born in 1953 and raised in New York City, New York.
She is 59 years old. Rebekah Nathan is a pseudonym for Cathy Small, an anthropology professor at Northern Arizona University. Nathan had to use a fake name to protect the identity of her students and her university.Throughout the writing of "My Freshman Year", Nathan paid for all the expenses in order to protect students’ confidentiality that could lead to situations that could harm them. Her projects formed alliances with numerous regional groups, such as Big Brothers and Big Sisters, the Institute for Law & Systems Research, and the Hopi Arts & Crafts Coop Guild. She earned state and national recognition, including the Praxis Award for Excellence in Applied Anthropology, the National Points of Light award, the Governor's Special Recognition, and Best Educational Practices in Post-Secondary Education in the state of Arizona award (for her co-founded mentoring and college scholarship program for low-income youth). Dedicated to her love of teaching, Cathy is unmarried and does not have children.
Ethnographic ethics.
Cathy A. Small is a cultural anthropologist, with a Ph.D. from Temple University, and currently a professor of anthropology at Northern Arizona University. Her ethnographic work, including her book "Voyages" (1997, Cornell University Press) about Tongan islander immigration to the U.S., has focused on understanding long-term social change. Dr. Small’s journey in ethnographic studies has expanded to the South Pacific. In the region more than 100 universities have adopted her book "Voyages". Her works were even selected by Pacific Studies for scholarly review. Small used the anthropological methodology of participant observation to study the contemporary life and practices of American university students. During a leave of absence from teaching, during the fall of 2002, at the age of 52, she enrolled as a student at Northern Arizona University, signing up for a standard first year range of courses. So as to more closely understand first year students' emotional, social and academic experiences, she moved into the student dorms and sequestered herself from family and friends. Two weeks before the date of her publication for this book, there was an article in the "New York Times", because people had figured out she was going by a different name the whole time she was attending this school. Small attended classes, completed homework, and participated in student activities. For one year, Small took classes, hung out in the student lounge (where she once got busted by the R.A. for drinking beer), participated in pickup volleyball games, and asked her fellow students a lot of questions. She also conducted interviews with her peers to get a closer look into the lives of other college students living on campus.Using the name “Rebekah Nathan”, the main focus of her book was to prove that college campuses are not a total unity and do not have a sense of community, but rather the social life is more controlled by ego centered networks or self selected peoples. During her stay at Northern Arizona University she collected her data need to write her book "My Freshman Year" by taking numerous surveys visually to see what races of people sit with each other to add to her central idea of how a social life actual is. When asked, she described herself as a writer interested in seeing what university was like.Dr. Cathy Small began Pipeline NAU, a program with the support of university adminis­tration and the help of committed faculty members. Approximately half of her interlocutors figured out she was a professor of anthropology at NAU. Small obtained informed consent from students she wanted to quote, although in her book she never identified them by name. She used the pseudonyms 'Rebekah Nathan' and 'AnyU', to protect the students and her university. Her intention was to offer enough ambiguity to provide privacy to her interlocutors while they were still in school. By the end of the year, Cathy had come to the conclusion that "ego-centered networks" are present all over university campuses.
However, "New York Sun" journalist Jacob Gershman reviewed the book just before it was released, and correctly suggested to which university and professor the pseudonyms referred. The book consequently became the subject of a media frenzy. It sparked numerous debates about the ethics of 'going undercover' in research, and Small's own career motives for writing the book.
In 1997, Dr. Cathy Small was awarded a National Science Foundation grant for 1998 and 1999 to model and simulate Polynesian social systems.
Cathy Smalls or known to some as “Rebekah Nathan” also received the American Anthropology Association/Oxford University Press Award for Undergraduate Teaching of Anthropology in 2008-2009 academic year.
Using pen names in anthropology has several precedents, including "Elenore Smith Bowen" (Laura Bohannan) and "Cesara Manda" (Karla Poewe), although it does seem to be a female practice. Equally, ethnographic studies of student life have precedents, the most well known being by Michael Moffatt (1989) and Dorothy C. Holland and Margaret A. Eisenhart. Cathy Small however, was the first anthropologist to attempt to use pseudonyms specifically to protect her interlocutors, while raising the issue of secrecy and ethnographic ethics in an afterward to the same book.
The book also stimulated discussions about the intellectual laziness of university students, and the difficulties of fully engaging in university without adequate financial support. Most students worked while attending school and rather than engaging in political, philosophical social justice or intellectual matters, students prioritized courses that promised to help them repay heavy student loans and spent a lot of time discussing bodily functions.

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1991 video game)

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a video game released in 1991, by Taito, for the NES based on the film by the same name. NOTE: There was also an NES game with the same title released by Ubisoft in 1993 that was a completely different game in itself, but also based on the movie.
Gameplay.
In the game, the player controls protagonist Indiana Jones going through levels taken directly from the film, albeit with a shorten and simplified plot. The game begins in 1938, with Indy receiving a package from Venice, Italy, that turns out to be his father’s Grail Diary. At the same time, he receives a telegram from Marcus Brody telling him the Cross of Coronado is on a ship off the Portuguese coast. The player is then presented with the choice of recovering the Cross of Coronado or going to Venice. 
When the player goes to recover the Cross, they are on a ship and must defeat a certain number of Panama Hat’s goons before fighting the boss himself. By recovering the cross Indy will receive a telegraph from Sallah who knows the location of the Holy Grail. Afterwards the player can head to Venice where they are presented with a sliding puzzle challenge. The player must complete the puzzle before the fire, traveling through the tunnel, engulfs the room. By solving the puzzle in time Indy receives a sketch showing the true holy grail. Another telegraph arrives from Sallah telling that Henry Jones, Sr. was taken captive by the Nazis is being held at Brunwald Castle and Marcus Brody has gone missing.
Saving Marcus takes place on top of a German tank in Iskenderun where Indy has to kill Nazis and Colonel Vogel before the tank plunges over a cliff. If the player fails, the Nazis steal the diary and Indy must travel to Berlin to recover it via a motorcycle riding sequence. At Brunwald Castle the player must navigate a convoluted maze to find Henry Jones Sr, although if caught they again must travel to Berlin to recover the diary.
At the final level of the game, the player finds themselves at the Lost Temple. They must carefully navigate the floor to spell out the word “Jehovah”. If they stand on the same tile for too long it falls or if they take too long the torch goes out. Afterwards they reach the final sanctum containing the Knight and several grails. If the player has the sketch from Venice it will aid in identifying the correct grail. Choosing the correct Grail will show the ending.
The game presents bitmapped pictures of the real movie actors, such as Harrison Ford and Sean Connery.

Venezia Santa Lucia railway station

Venezia Santa Lucia railway station () is a terminal railway station serving the city of Venice, Italy. It is also the only railway station in the historic city of Venice ().
The station is one of Venice's two most important railway stations, the other one being Venezia Mestre, a junction station in Venice's mainland frazione of Mestre. Both stations are managed by Grandi Stazioni and they are linked with each other by the Ponte della Libertà () between the mainland and the historic city.
Location.
Venezia Santa Lucia is located in Cannaregio, the northernmost of the six historic "sestieri" (districts) of the historic city, near the western end of the Grand Canal. It lies at the mark of the Milan–Venice railway.
A bridge over the Grand Canal, the Ponte degli Scalzi (or Ponte dei Scalzi) (), links the concourse in front of the station with the sestiere of Santa Croce.
Since 2008, the concourse has also been linked with Piazzale Roma, the car terminal in the historic city and main terminus for all bus routes in and out of Venice, and by another Grand Canal bridge, the controversial Ponte della Costituzione ().
History.
Construction of the Santa Lucia station began in 1860. In order to make room for both the station and its forecourt, a convent and the Church of Santa Lucia were demolished in 1861. The station, in turn, took up the name of the church.
The current station building is one of the few modernist buildings facing the Grand Canal. It is the result of a series of plans started up by the rationalist architect Angiolo Mazzoni in 1924 and developed by him over the next decade.
In 1934, a contest for a detailed design for the current station was won by Virgilio Vallot. Between 1936 and 1943, Mazzoni and Vallot collaborated on the construction of the station building, whereas Mazzoni also designed the train hall. This work, however, was completed only some years later, in 1952, on a design developed by another architect, Paul Perilli.
In November 2009, work began on the renovation of the station. The renovation programme would include improvements to the use of spaces and the flow of internal transit. Additionally, certain architectural elements will be recovered and restored; the atrium will be altered to house several retail spaces. This project is estimated to take two years and cost 24 million euros.
Features.
As the current station building is low and wide, it does not dominate its surroundings. The flanks of its façade are decorated with Venetian lions. Behind the façade, there is a sizeable main hall with ticketing facilities, shops, offices and luggage storage facilities. The main hall also leads to the station's 16 platforms.
Train services.
The following services call at the station (incomplete):
Traffic.
The station is used by about 82,000 passengers per day, or a total of around 30 million passengers per annum.
Every day, approximately 450 trains stop at the station. Long-distance trains use the central platforms, and the regional and suburban platforms are located to the west.
The station is the terminus of several famous trains, including the Venice Simplon Orient Express.
Interchange.
Overview.
The station is connected with the rest of Venice by the Vaporetto (public water bus) or private water taxi boats. The nearby Piazzale Roma is the departure point for all car services and taxis for the mainland.
Vaporetto lines in the transit station.
The stop (dock) is called "Ferrovia" and is served by eight ACTV Vaporetto lines:

Originally scheduled for January 26 to February 5, the festival was postponed because of a lack of available venues, since Bangkok cinemas at the time had planned to be fully booked with screenings of the part one of "The Legend of King Naresuan".
In addition, the film festival organization was hit with a massive budget cut, from 180 million baht to 60 million baht, which resulted in festival organizers, the Tourism Authority of Thailand, having to break their contract with Los Angeles-based Film Festival Management, which had programmed the festival since 2004.
In previous years, the festival's focus had been on big-budget Hollywood films and lavish, red-carpet appearances by celebrities, flown to Bangkok at the festival's expense. With the budget cut and the focus on Asian films, the 2007 festival was expected to be a departure from past years.
Controversy.
The festival initially announced that the French-produced animated feature "Persepolis" would open the festival. The film is an adaptation of a graphic novel by Marjane Satrapi (who co-directed the film), telling the story of her childhood growing up in Iran during the Islamic Revolution. However, the Embassy of Iran asked the festival organizers to consider showing another film from Iran, so "Persepolis" was dropped from the program. The festival director, Chattan Kunjara Na Ayudhya, was quoted as saying:
I was invited by the Iranian embassy to discuss the matter and we both came to mutual agreement that it would be beneficial to both countries if the film was not shown. It's a good film, but there are other considerations.
We had a request from the Iranian Embassy that the film festival remove the film, and we did. Now we move on.
However, Chattan also said that the decision to cancel the film was his alone and that "there was no outside pressure".
The Hungarian film, "Children of Glory", depicting the "Blood in the Water" Olympic water polo match and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, was chosen as the replacement opening film.
Program highlights.
The festival's lineup featured a retrospective of films by Spanish director Luis Buñuel and a tribute to Indian actress Hema Malini. Malini was among the celebrities taking part in the festival's opening night festivities.
The main competition categories for the Golden Kinaree were for international films and ASEAN films from Southeast Asia, as well as an international short-film competition. Non-competition sections were for Thai Panorama (Thai films released in 2006 and 2007) Asian films, ASEAN films, documentaries and the wide-ranging Windows on the World.
The closing film was "Muay Thai Chaiya", a Thai boxing drama film directed by Kongkiat Khomsiri.
Competition.
Competition trophies were given out in an awards banquet presided over by Princess Ubol Ratana in the World Ballroom in the Centara Grand and Bangkok Convention Centre at CentralWorld.

Prostaglandin antagonist

A Prostaglandin antagonist is a hormone antagonist acting upon prostaglandin.
NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase and reduce prostaglandin synthesis. Corticosteroids inhibit phospholipase A2 production by boosting production of lipocortin, an inhibitor protein. Relatively new drugs, known as COX-2 selective inhibitors or coxibs, are used as specific inhibitors of COX-2. The development of these drugs allowed the circumvention of the negative gastrointestinal effects while effectively reducing inflammation.
Adverse effects.
Both NSAIDs and Coxibs can raise the risk of myocardial infarction, when taken on a chronic basis for at least 18 months. One emerging hypothesis that may explain the cardiovascular effects is that coxibs create an imbalance in circulating TxA2 (thromboxane) and PGI2 (prostacyclin) levels. An increased in the ratio of TxA2/PGI2 could lead to increased platelet aggregation and dysregulation of platelet homeostasis.

List of Combined Statistical Areas

The United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has defined 166 Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs) for the United States and three for Puerto Rico. The OMB defines a Combined Statistical Area as an aggregate of adjacent Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) (either Metropolitan Statistical Areas or Micropolitan Statistical Areas) that are linked by commuting ties.
The Combined Statistical Area is the most extensive of the metropolitan area concepts defined by the OMB. The population of a Combined Statistical Area is the sum of its (often similarly named) constituent Core Based Statistical Areas. Many other metropolitan areas such as Phoenix, San Diego, Tampa and San Antonio have only a single urban core, and thus have no associated CSA. In addition, the U.S. Census Bureau considers only the U.S. resident population of metropolitan areas adjacent to international borders, such as Detroit, San Diego, Buffalo, and El Paso. The bureau does not count people living near the United States but not actually in the country, such as Canadians living near Detroit or Buffalo, or Mexicans living near El Paso or San Diego.

The King Edward Breeders' Cup Stakes is a Canadian Thoroughbred horse race run annually at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario. The Grade II turf race is open to horses aged three and older and is raced over a distance of one mile (8 furlongs). Run in mid June, it currently offers a purse of approximately $200,000.
Named for Edward VII of the United Kingdom who had been crowned king in 1901, the race was created the following year with its first running taking place in 1903 as the King Edward Gold Cup. It was raced on dirt at the Old Woodbine Park until 1958 when it was moved to Woodbine Racetrack and changed to a turf race. Renamed the King Edward Breeders' Handicap, in 2007 it became a Stakes event.
Since inception, the King Edward Stakes has been raced at a variety of distances:
Due to the large number of entries, the King Edward was raced in two divisions in 1978, 1984, 1985, 1987, and 1988. There was no race held in 1918, 1919, 143, 1945, and 1956.

He is regarded as a leading intellectual figure on the island and is influential in literature and the media. His native language is Mauritian Creole, though he is fluent in French and English as well (Asgarally teaches in the latter).
Biography.
Asgarally was born in a part of Mauritius where many ethnic groups are co-located and has tried to bring the groups together through a philosophy of peace. In this regard, Asgarally opposes the “multicultural” approach, which he believes emphasizes an understanding of the various cultures and the differences between them, and instead advocates an emphasis upon the commonalities between people. He asserts that there is a fundamental unity of people as human beings which can then become the basis upon which any balanced system needs be built. As a result of such balance, Asgarally explains that people would see each other as equal partners and enjoy a confidence in both themselves and each other - there would also be equal access to economic and political power.
Asgarally has published ten books on diverse but related topics, including literature, social issues, philosophy, history, education, culture and the arts. He has also written about the consequences of slavery in the Indian Ocean.
Together with the winner of the 2008 Nobel Prize for Literature, Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio (Clézio's parents had strong ties with Mauritius), Asgarally has created the Fondation pour l'Interculturel et la Paix (FIP) website.

Leukotriene antagonist

A leukotriene antagonist (sometimes referred to as a leukast) is a drug that inhibits leukotrienes, which are fatty compounds produced by the immune system that cause inflammation in asthma and bronchitis, and constrict airways. 
Leukotriene inhibitors (or modifiers), such as montelukast (trade names Singulair and Montelo-10), zafirlukast, pranlukast and zileuton, are used to treat those diseases. They are less effective than corticosteroids and are thus less preferred in the treatment of asthma.
Approaches.
There are two main approaches to block the actions of leukotrienes.
Inhibition of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway.
Drugs such as zileuton block 5-lipoxygenase, inhibiting the synthetic pathway of leukotriene metabolism, whereas drugs such as MK-886 block the 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) and may help in treating atherosclerosis.
Antagonism of cysteinyl-leukotriene type 1 receptors.
Agents such as montelukast and zafirlukast block the actions of cysteinyl leukotrienes at the CysLT1 receptor on target cells such as bronchial smooth muscle.
These modifiers have been shown to improve asthma symptoms, reduce asthma exacerbations and limit markers of inflammation such as eosinophil counts in the peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. This demonstrates that they have anti-inflammatory properties.

<doc id="9773858" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9773858" title="Bisulfite sequencing">
Bisulfite sequencing

Bisulphite sequencing (also known as bisulfite sequencing) is the use of bisulphite treatment of DNA to determine its pattern of methylation. DNA methylation was the first discovered epigenetic mark, and remains the most studied. In animals it predominantly involves the addition of a methyl group to the carbon-5 position of cytosine residues of the dinucleotide CpG, and is implicated in repression of transcriptional activity.
Treatment of DNA with bisulphite converts cytosine residues to uracil, but leaves 5-methylcytosine residues unaffected. Thus, bisulphite treatment introduces specific changes in the DNA sequence that depend on the methylation status of individual cytosine residues, yielding single- nucleotide resolution information about the methylation status of a segment of DNA. Various analyses can be performed on the altered sequence to retrieve this information. The objective of this analysis is therefore reduced to differentiating between single nucleotide polymorphisms (cytosines and thymidine) resulting from bisulphite conversion (Figure 1).
Methods.
Bisulphite sequencing applies routine sequencing methods on bisulphite-treated genomic DNA to determine methylation status at CpG dinucleotides. Other non-sequencing strategies are also employed to interrogate the methylation at specific loci or at a genome-wide level. All strategies assume that bisulphite-induced conversion of unmethylated cytosines to uracil is complete, and this serves as the basis of all subsequent techniques. Ideally, the method used would determine the methylation status separately for each allele. Alternative methods to bisulphite sequencing include Combined Bisulphite Restriction Analysis and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP).
Methodologies to analyze bisulphite-treated DNA are continuously being developed. To summarize these rapidly evolving methologies, numerous review articles have been written.
The methodologies can be generally divided into strategies based on methylation-specific PCR (MSP) (Figure 4), and strategies employing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed under non-methylation-specific conditions (Figure 3). Microarray-based methods use PCR based on non-methylation-specific conditions also.
Non-methylation-specific PCR based methods.
Direct sequencing.
The first reported method of methylation analysis using bisulphite-treated DNA utilized PCR and standard dideoxynucleotide DNA sequencing to directly determine the nucleotides resistant to bisulphite conversion. Primers are designed to be strand-specific as well as bisulphite-specific (i.e., primers containing non-CpG cytosines such that they are not complementary to non-bisulphite-treated DNA), flanking (but not involving) the methylation site of interest. Therefore, it will amplify both methylated and unmethylated sequences, in contrast to methylation-specific PCR. All sites of unmethylated cytosines are displayed as thymines in the resulting amplified sequence of the sense strand, and as adenines in the amplified antisense strand. This technique required cloning of the PCR product prior to sequencing for adequate sensitivity, and therefore was a very labour-intensive method unsuitable for higher throughput. Alternatively, nested PCR methods can be used to enhance the product for sequencing.
All subsequent DNA methylation analysis techniques using bisulphite-treated DNA is based on this report by Frommer et al. (Figure 2) (). Although most other modalities are not true sequencing-based techniques, the term "bisulphite sequencing" is often used to describe bisulphite-conversion DNA methylation analysis techniques in general.
Pyrosequencing.
Pyrosequencing has also been used to analyze bisulphite-treated DNA without using methylation-specific PCR. Following PCR amplification of the region of interest, Pyrosequencing is used to determine the bisulphite-converted sequence of specific CpG sites in the region. The ratio of C-to-T at individual sites can be determined quantitatively based on the amount of C and T incorporation during the sequence extension. The main limitation of this method is the cost of the technology. However, Pyrosequencing does well allow for extension to high-throughput screening methods.
A further improvement to this technique was recently described by Wong et al., which uses allele-specific primers that incorporate single-nucleotide polymorphisms into the sequence of the sequencing primer, thus allowing for separate analysis of maternal and paternal alleles. This technique is of particular usefulness for genomic imprinting analysis.
Methylation-sensitive single-strand conformation analysis (MS-SSCA).
This method is based on the single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCA) method developed for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. SSCA differentiates between single-stranded DNA fragments of identical size but distinct sequence based on differential migration in non-denaturating electrophoresis. In MS-SSCA, this is used to distinguish between bisulphite-treated, PCR-amplified regions containing the CpG sites of interest. Although SSCA lacks sensitivity when only a single nucleotide difference is present, bisulphite treatment frequently makes a number of C-to-T conversions in most regions of interest, and the resulting sensitivity approaches 100%. MS-SSCA also provides semi-quantitative analysis of the degree of DNA methylation based on the ratio of band intensities. However, this method is designed to assess all CpG sites as a whole in the region of interest rather than individual methylation sites.
High resolution melting analysis (HRM).
A further method to differentiate converted from unconverted bisulphite-treated DNA is using high-resolution melting analysis (HRM), a quantitative PCR-based technique initially designed to distinguish SNPs. The PCR amplicons are analyzed directly by temperature ramping and resulting liberation of an intercalating fluorescent dye during melting. The degree of methylation, as represented by the C-to-T content in the amplicon, determines the rapidity of melting and consequent release of the dye. This method allows direct quantitation in a single-tube assay, but assesses methylation in the amplified region as a whole rather than at specific CpG sites.
Methylation-sensitive single-nucleotide primer extension (MS-SnuPE).
MS-SnuPE employs the primer extension method initially designed for analyzing single-nucleotide polymorphisms. DNA is bisulphite-converted, and bisulphite-specific primers are annealed to the sequence up to the base pair immediately before the CpG of interest. The primer is allowed to extend one base pair into the C (or T) using DNA polymerase terminating dideoxynucleotides, and the ratio of C to T is determined quantitatively.
A number of methods can be used to determine this C:T ratio. At the beginning, MS-SnuPE relied on radioactive ddNTPs as the reporter of the primer extension. Fluorescence-based methods or Pyrosequencing can also be used. However, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analysis to differentiate between the two polymorphic primer extension products can be used, in essence, based on the GOOD assay designed for SNP genotyping. Ion pair reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (IP-RP-HPLC) has also been used to distinguish primer extension products.
Base-specific cleavage/MALDI-TOF.
A recently described method by Ehrich et al. further takes advantage of bisulphite-conversions by adding a base-specific cleavage step to enhance the information gained from the nucleotide changes. By first using in vitro transcription of the region of interest into RNA (by adding an RNA polymerase promoter site to the PCR primer in the initial amplification), RNase A can be used to cleave the RNA transcript at base-specific sites. As RNase A cleaves RNA specifically at cytosine and uracil ribonucleotides, base-specificity is achieved by adding incorporating cleavage-resistant dTTP when cytosine-specific (C-specific) cleavage is desired, and incorporating dCTP when uracil-specific (U-specific) cleavage is desired. The cleaved fragments can then be analyzed by MALDI-TOF. Bisulphite treatment results in either introduction/removal of cleavage sites by C-to-U conversions or shift in fragment mass by G-to-A conversions in the amplified reverse strand. C-specific cleavage will cut specifically at all methylated CpG sites. By analyzing the sizes of the resulting fragments, it is possible to determine the specific pattern of DNA methylation of CpG sites within the region, rather than determining the extent of methylation of the region as a whole. This method demonstrated efficacy for high-throughput screening, allowing for interrogation of numerous CpG sites in multiple tissues in a cost-efficient manner.
Methylation-specific PCR (MSP).
This alternative method of methylation analysis also uses bisulphite-treated DNA but avoids the need to sequence the area of interest. Instead, primer pairs are designed themselves to be "methylated-specific" by including sequences complementing only unconverted 5-methylcytosines, or, on the converse, "unmethylated-specific", complementing thymines converted from unmethylated cytosines. Methylation is determined by the ability of the specific primer to achieve amplification. This method is particularly useful to interrogate CpG islands with possibly high methylation density, as increased numbers of CpG pairs in the primer increase the specificity of the assay. Placing the CpG pair at the 3'-end of the primer also improves the sensitivity. The initial report using MSP described sufficient sensitivity to detect methylation of 0.1% of alleles. In general, MSP and its related protocols are considered to be the most sensitive when interrogating the methylation status at a specific locus.
The MethyLight method is based on MSP, but provides a quantitative analysis using quantitative PCR. Methylated-specific primers are used, and a methylated-specific fluorescence reporter probe is also used that anneals to the amplified region. In alternative fashion, the primers or probe can be designed without methylation specificity if discrimination is needed between the CpG pairs within the involved sequences. Quantitation is made in reference to a methylated reference DNA. A modification to this protocol to increase the specificity of the PCR for successfully bisulphite-converted DNA (ConLight-MSP) uses an additional probe to bisulphite-unconverted DNA to quantify this non-specific amplification.
Further methodology using MSP-amplified DNA analyzes the products using melting curve analysis (Mc-MSP). This method amplifies bisulphite-converted DNA with both methylated-specific and unmethylated-specific primers, and determines the quantitative ratio of the two products by comparing the differential peaks generated in a melting curve analysis. A high-resolution melting analysis method that uses both quantitative PCR and melting analysis has been introduced, in particular, for sensitive detection of low-level methylation
Microarray-based methods.
Microarray-based methods are a logical extension of the technologies available to analyze bisulphite-treated DNA to allow for genome-wide analysis of methylation. Oligonucleotide microarrays are designed using pairs of oligonucleotide hybridization probes targeting CpG sites of interest. One is complementary to the unaltered methylated sequence, and the other is complementary to the C-to-U-converted unmethylated sequence. The probes are also bisulphite-specific to prevent binding to DNA incompletely converted by bisulphite. The Illumina Methylation Assay is one such assay that applies the bisulphite sequencing technology on a microarray level to generate genome-wide methylation data.
Limitations.
5-Hydroxymethylcytosine.
Bisulphite sequencing is used widely across mammalian genomes, however complications have arisen with the discovery of a new mammalian DNA modification 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine converts to cytosine-5-methylsulfonate upon bisulphite treatment, which then reads as a C when sequenced. Therefore, bisulphite sequencing cannot discriminate between 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcyosine. This means that the output from bisulphite sequencing can no longer be defined as solely DNA methylation, as it is the composite of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. The development of Tet-assisted bisulphite sequencing is now able to distinguish between the two modifications at single base resolution.
Incomplete conversion.
Bisulphite sequencing relies on the conversion of every single unmethylated cytosine residue to uracil. If conversion is incomplete, the subsequent analysis will incorrectly interpret the unconverted unmethylated cytosines as methylated cytosines, resulting in false positive results for methylation. Only cytosines in single-stranded DNA are susceptible to attack by bisulphite, therefore denaturation of the DNA undergoing analysis is critical. It is important to ensure that reaction parameters such as temperature and salt concentration are suitable to maintain the DNA in a single-stranded conformation and allow for complete conversion. Embedding the DNA in agarose gel has been reported to improve the rate of conversion by keeping strands of DNA physically separate.
Degradation of DNA during bisulphite treatment.
A major challenge in bisulphite sequencing is the degradation of DNA that takes place concurrently with the conversion. The conditions necessary for complete conversion, such as long incubation times, elevated temperature, and high bisulphite concentration, can lead to the degradation of about 90% of the incubated DNA. Given that the starting amount of DNA is often limited, such extensive degradation can be problematic. The degradation occurs as depurinations resulting in random strand breaks. Therefore the longer the desired PCR amplicon, the more limited the number of intact template molecules will likely be. This could lead to the failure of the PCR amplification, or the loss of quantitatively accurate information on methylation levels resulting from the limited sampling of template molecules. Thus, it is important to assess the amount of DNA degradation resulting from the reaction conditions employed, and consider how this will affect the desired amplicon. Techniques can also be used to minimize DNA degradation, such as cycling the incubation temperature.
Other concerns.
A potentially significant problem following bisulphite treatment is incomplete desulfonation of pyrimidine residues due to inadequate alkalization of the solution. This may inhibit some DNA polymerases, rendering subsequent PCR difficult. However, this situation can be avoided by monitoring the pH of the solution to ensure that desulfonation will be complete.
A final concern is that bisulphite treatment greatly reduces the level of complexity in the sample, which can be problematic if multiple PCR reactions are to be performed (2006). Primer design is more difficult, and inappropriate cross-hybridization is more frequent.
Applications: genome-wide methylation analysis.
The advances in bisulphite sequencing have led to the possibility of applying them at a genome-wide scale, where, previously, global measure of DNA methylation was feasible only using other techniques, such as Restriction landmark genomic scanning. The mapping of the human epigenome is seen by many scientists as the logical follow-up to the completion of the Human Genome Project. This epigenomic information will be important in understanding how the function of the genetic sequence is implemented and regulated. Since the epigenome is less stable than the genome, it is thought to be important in gene-environment interactions.
Epigenomic mapping is inherently more complex than genome sequencing, however, since the epigenome is much more variable than the genome. One’s epigenome varies with age, differs between tissues, is altered by environmental factors, and shows aberrations in diseases. Such rich epigenomic mapping, however, representing different ages, tissue types, and disease states, would yield valuable information on the normal function of epigenetic marks as well as the mechanisms leading to aging and disease.
Direct benefits of epigenomic mapping include probable advances in cloning technology. It is believed that failures to produce cloned animals with normal viability and lifespan result from inappropriate patterns of epigenetic marks. Also, aberrant methylation patterns are well characterized in many cancers. Global hypomethylation results in decreased genomic stability, while local hypermethylation of tumour suppressor gene promoters often accounts for their loss of function. Specific patterns of methylation are indicative of specific cancer types, have prognostic value, and can help to guide the best course of treatment.
Large-scale epigenome mapping efforts are under way around the world and have been organized under the Human Epigenome Project. This is based on a multi-tiered strategy, whereby bisulphite sequencing is used to obtain high-resolution methylation profiles for a limited number of reference epigenomes, while less thorough analysis is performed on a wider spectrum of samples. This approach is intended to maximize the insight gained from a given amount of resources, as high-resolution genome-wide mapping remains a costly undertaking.
Gene-set analysis (for example using tools like DAVID and GoSeq) has been shown to be severely baised when applied to high-throughput methylation data (e.g. genome-wide bisulphite sequencing); it has been suggested that this can be corrected using sample label permutations or using a statistical model to control for differences in the numberes of CpG probes / CpG sites that target each gene.
Oxidative Bisulphite Sequencing.
5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine both read as a C in bisulphite sequencing. Oxidative bisulphite sequencing is a method to discriminate between 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine at single base resolution. The method employs a specific chemical oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine to 5-formylcytosine, which subsequently converts to uracil during bisulphite treatment. The only base that then reads as a C is 5‑methylcytosine, giving a map of the true methylation status in the DNA sample. Levels of 5‑hydroxymethylcytosine can also be quantified by measuring the difference between bisulphite and oxidative bisulphite sequencing.

<doc id="9773940" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9773940" title="Antithyroid agent">
Antithyroid agent

An antithyroid agent is a hormone antagonist acting upon thyroid hormones.
The main antithyroid drugs are carbimazole (in the UK), methimazole (in the US), and propylthiouracil/PTU. A less common antithyroid agent is potassium perchlorate.
Mechanism of action.
The mechanisms of action are not completely understood. Some scientists believe that anti-thyroids inhibit iodination of tyrosyl residues in thyroglobulin. It is thought that they inhibit the thyroperoxidase catalyzed oxidation reactions by acting as substrates for the postulated peroxidase-iodine complex, thus competitively inhibiting the interaction with the amino acid tyrosine. Propylthiouracil additionally may reduce the de-iodination of T4 into T3 in peripheral tissues.
Adverse effects.
The most dangerous side-effect is agranulocytosis (1/250, more in PTU); this is an idiosyncratic reaction which generally resolves on cessation of drug. It occurs in about 0.2 to 0.3% of cases treated with antithyroid drugs. Others include granulocytopenia (dose dependent, which improves on cessation of the drug) and aplastic anemia, and for propylthiouracil severe, fulminant liver failure. Patients on these medications should see a doctor if they develop sore throat or fever. 
The most common side effects are rash and peripheral neuritis. These drugs also cross the placenta and are secreted in breast milk. Lugol's iodine is used to block hormone synthesis before surgery.
Usage in Graves' disease.
In Graves' disease, treatment with antithyroid medications must be given for six months to two years, in order to be effective. Even then, upon cessation of the drugs, the hyperthyroid state may recur. Side effects of the antithyroid medications include a potentially fatal reduction in the level of white blood cells.
A randomized control trial testing single dose treatment for Graves' found methimazole achieved euthyroid state more effectively after 12 weeks than did propylthyouracil (77.1% on methimazole 15 mg vs 19.4% in the propylthiouracil 150 mg groups). But generally both drugs are considered equivalent.
A study has shown no difference in outcome for adding thyroxine to antithyroid medication and continuing thyroxine versus placebo after antithyroid medication withdrawal. However, two markers were found that can help predict the risk of recurrence. These two markers are an elevated level of thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TSHR-Ab) and smoking. A positive TSHR-Ab at the end of antithyroid drug treatment increases the risk of recurrence to 90% (sensitivity 39%, specificity 98%), a negative TSHR-Ab at the end of antithyroid drug treatment is associated with a 78% chance of remaining in remission. Smoking was shown to have an impact independent to a positive TSHR-Ab.

Lansky (film)

Lansky is a 1999 American made-for-television crime drama film. Directed by John McNaughton, it stars Richard Dreyfuss as the famous gangster Meyer Lansky, Eric Roberts as Bugsy Siegel, and Ryan Merriman as the young Lansky.
Plot summary.
The movie circuits around flashbacks of Lansky's life, the first showing is as Lansky as an old man looking for a rock to put on his grandfather's grave in Jerusalem. Upon seeing soldiers of the Israeli Defense Force, Lansky expresses regret that his Grandfather never lived to see them. As he walks through a tunnel, he catches sight of an old man. He recalls how at the age of 10 years old, he witnessed an elderly Jew being bludgeoned to death with an axe during a pogrom.
Later, as the shtetl is burning down, his parents hastily pack up their valuables and prepare to flee to America. Lansky's Grandfather watches sceptically. Meanwhile, his father suggests, "You think I should fight? You stay, and you fight."
The film then changes to the Lower East Side, Manhattan. After his mother gives him money to go buy challah for Shabbat, Lansky comes upon a game of craps on the street corner. Later, Lansky returns home penniless and deeply ashamed.
Later, Benjamin Siegel and Lansky are eyeing the Irish-American boy who operates the craps game, Lansky makes his bet as he's throwing the dice the owner's friend slides him some dice. Certain that the game is rigged, Lansky shouts that he won the bet. The Irish boy pushes at the young Lansky, Lansky pushes him back then the teenager's friend slides out his knife and cuts Lansky's arm, Benjamin Seigel come into the scene and hits the knife kid with a brick shouting at him telling him to give him the money. As Lansky and Benjamin are walking down the docks they see the Irish kid who bet against them in the alley the Irish kid is shouting Irish word about him being Jewish, Lansky jumps into the sea where the Irish kid is hanging about, Lansky then goes under water and slits the Irish kid's neck.
As the blood is sliding around the water is goes back to Lansky as an old man drinking wine with the Jewish man. The Jewish man goes of to pray in the synagogue. The film goes on showing Lansky owning the crap games as a kid Lansky goes of into an alley to count his money this is where he meets Charles "Lucky" Luciano when Charles was telling him to give protection money the gang start to give Lansky a beating. Lansky is saying "Nothing For Nothing" Luciano takes a liking to Lansky's guts, they the work together selling illegal booze, Bugsy, Luciano and Lansky are making their way driving the truck with booze in. They are ambushed by Arnold Rothstein's associates. Luciano and Lansky make a deal saying they will give them 1 truck full of booze and no one will be shot at, when Lansky, Bugsy and Luciano get into the truck we find out the truck was full of empty suitcases. Impressed, Rothstein invites them to his house for a sit-down. He offers Bugsy and Lansky a job to work for him as he knows Lansky is smart. After Rothstein is taken out Meyer and Bugsy work with Luciano to take over the crime world killing the Italian bosses Joe Masseria and Salvatore Maranzano. Luciano then sets up the Commission and the 5 Italian families can now work freely with Jews. Meyer builds his prestige by running all the casinos in Cuba and helping Bugsy get a start in Las Vegas. After Bugsy spends more money than the plan and his girlfriend is questioned in taking money, Meyer buys his childhood friend time to turn the venture around. A month after warning Siegel the Flamingo is not earning money and Lansky can no longer prevent the Commission from taking out Siegel. Years later Lansky is on the run in Israel to avoid tax evasion charges but is extradited back to the U.S. He is lucky to get off on the charges and retires to Miami.
At the climax of the film, Lansky gives an interview to a French journalist. When the journalist asks him what he would do if he could live his life over, Lansky responds, "I wouldn't change a thing."
Critical reception.
The TV film got 5.0/10 at the IMDb. The film received mixed reviews.

<doc id="9774017" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9774017" title="Biomolecular Object Network Databank">
Biomolecular Object Network Databank

The Biomolecular Object Network Databank (BOND) is a bioinformatics databank containing information on small molecule and protein sequences, structures and interactions. The databank integrates a number of existing databases to provide a comprehensive overview of the information currently available for a given molecule.
Background.
The Blueprint Initiative started as a research program in the lab of Dr. Christopher Hogue at the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. On December 14, 2005 Unleashed Informatics Limited acquired the commercial rights to The Blueprint Initiative intellectual property. This included rights to the protein interaction database BIND, the small molecule interaction database SMID, as well as the data warehouse SeqHound. Unleashed Informatics is a data management service provider and is overseeing the management and curation of The Blueprint Initiative under the guidance of Dr. Hogue.
Construction.
BOND integrates the original Blueprint Initiative databases as well as other databases, such as Genbank, combined with many tools required to analyze these data. Annotation links for sequences, including taxon identifiers, redundant sequences, Gene Ontology descriptions, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man identifiers, conserved domains, data base cross-references, LocusLink Identifiers and complete genomes are also available. BOND facilitates cross-database queries and is an open access resource which integrates interaction and sequence data.
Small Molecule Interaction Database (SMID).
The Small Molecule Interaction Database is a database containing protein domain-small molecule interactions. It uses a domain-based approach to identify domain families, found in the Conserved Domain Database (CDD), which interact with a query small molecule. The CDD from NCBI amalgamates data from several different sources; Protein FAMilies (PFAM), Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART), Cluster of Orthologous Genes (COGs), and NCBI’s own curated sequences. The data in SMID is derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a database of known protein crystal structures.
SMID can be queried by entering a protein GI, domain identifier, PDB ID or SMID ID. The results of a search provide small molecule, protein, and domain information for each interaction identified in the database. Interactions with non-biological contacts are normally screened out by default. 
SMID-BLAST is a tool developed to annotate known small-molecule binding sites as well as to predict binding sites in proteins whose crystal structures have not yet been determined. The prediction is based on extrapolation of known interactions, found in the PDB, to interactions between an uncrystallized protein with a small molecule of interest. SMID-BLAST was validated against a test set of known small molecule interactions from the PDB. It was shown to be an accurate predictor of protein-small molecule interactions; 60% of predicted interactions identically matched the PDB annotated binding site, and of these 73% had greater than 80% of the binding residues of the protein correctly identified. Hogue, C et al. estimated that 45% of predictions that were not observed in the PDB data do in fact represent true positives.
Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND).
Introduction.
The idea of a database to document all known molecular interactions was originally put forth by Tony Pawson in the 1990s and was later developed by scientists at the University of Toronto in collaboration with the University of British Columbia. The development of the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND) has been supported by grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), Genome Canada, the Canadian Foundation for Innovation and the Ontario Research and Development Fund. BIND was originally designed to be a constantly growing depository for information regarding biomolecular interactions, molecular complexes and pathways. As proteomics is a rapidly advancing field, there is a need to have information from scientific journals readily available to researchers. BIND facilitates the understanding of molecular interactions and pathways involved in cellular processes and will eventually give scientists a better understanding of developmental processes and disease pathogenesis
The major goals of the BIND project are: to create a public proteomics resource that is available to all; to create a platform to enable datamining from other sources (PreBIND); to create a platform capable of presenting visualizations of complex molecular interactions. From the beginning, BIND has been open access and software can be freely distributed and modified. Currently, BIND includes a data specification, a database and associated data mining and visualization tools. Eventually, it is hoped that BIND will be a collection of all the interactions occurring in each of the major model organisms.
Database structure.
BIND contains information on three types of data: interactions, molecular complexes and pathways. 
The minimum amount of information needed to create an entry in BIND is a PubMed publication reference and an entry in another database (e.g. GenBank). Each entry withiin the database provides references/authors for the data. As BIND is a constantly growing database, all components of BIND track updates and changes.
BIND is based on a data specification written using Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (ASN.1) language. ASN.1 is used also by NCBI when storing data for their Entrez system and because of this BIND uses the same standards as NCBI for data representation. The ASN.1 language is preferred because it can be easily translated into other data specification languages (e.g. XML), can easily handle complex data and can be applied to all biological interactions – not just proteins. Bader and Hogue (2000) have prepared a detailed manuscript on the ASN.1 data specification used by BIND.
Data submission and curation.
User submission to the database is encouraged. To contribute to the database, one must submit: contact info, PubMed identifier and the two molecules that interact. The person who submits a record is the owner of it. All records are validated before being made public and BIND is curated for quality assurance. BIND curation has two tracks: high-throughput (HTP) and low-throughput (LTP). HTP records are from papers which have reported more than 40 interaction results from one experimental methodology. HTP curators typically have a bioinformatics backgrounds. The HTP curators are responsible for the collection of storage of experimental data and they also create scripts to update BIND based on new publications. LTP records are curated by individuals with either an MSc or PhD and laboratory experience in interaction research. LTP curators are given further training through the Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops. Information on small molecule chemistry is curated separately by chemists to ensure the curator is knowledgeable about the subject. The priority for BIND curation is to focus on LTP to collect information as it is published. Although, HTP studies provide more information at once, there are more LTP studies being reported and similar numbers of interactions are being reported by both tracks. In 2004, BIND collected data from 110 journals.
Database growth.
BIND has grown significantly since its conception; in fact, the database saw a 10 fold increase in entries between 2003 and 2004. By September 2004, there were over 100,000 interaction records by 2004 (including 58,266 protein-protein, 4,225 genetic, 874 protein-small molecule, 25,857 protein-DNA, and 19,348 biopolymer interactions). The database also contains sequence information for 31,972 proteins, 4560 DNA samples and 759 RNA samples. These entries have been collected from 11,649 publications; therefore, the database represents an important amalgamation of data. The organisms with entries in the database include: "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Homo sapiens", "Mus musculus", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Helicobacter pylori", "Bos taurus", HIV-1, "Gallus gallus", "Arabidopsis thaliana", as well as others. In total, 901 taxa were included by September 2004 and BIND has been split up into BIND-Metazoa, BIND-Fungi, and BIND-Taxroot.
Not only is the information contained within the database continually updated, the software itself has gone through several revisions. Version 1.0 of BIND was released in 1999 and based on user feedback it was modified to include additional detail on experimental conditions required for binding and a hierarchical description of cellular location of the interaction. Version 2.0 was released in 2001 and included the capability to link to information available in other databases. Version 3.0 (2002) expanded the database from physical/biochemical interactions to also include genetic interactions. Version 3.5 (2004) included a refined user-interface that aimed to simplify information retrieval. In 2006, BIND was incorporated into the Biomolecular Object Network Database (BOND) where it continues to be updated and improved.
Special features.
BIND was the first database of its kind to contain info on biomolecular interactions, reactions and pathways in one schema. It is also the first to base its ontology on chemistry which allows 3D representation of molecular interactions. The underlying chemistry allows molecular interactions to be described down to the atomic level of resolution.
PreBIND an associated system for data mining to locate biomolecular interaction information in the scientific literature. The name or accession number of a protein can be entered and PreBIND will scan the literature and return a list of potentially interacting proteins. BIND BLAST is also available to find interactions with proteins that are similar to the one specified in the query.
BIND offers several “features” that many other proteomics databases do not include. The authors of this program have created an extension to traditional IUPAC nomenclature to help describe post-translational modifications that occur to amino acids. These modifications include: acetylation, formylation, methylation, palmitoylation, etc. the extension of the traditional IUPAC codes allows these amino acids to be represented in sequence form as well. BIND also utilizes a unique visualization tool known as OntoGlyphs. The OntoGlyphs were developed based on Gene Ontology (GO) and provide a link back to the original GO information. A number of GO terms have been grouped into categories, each one representing a specific function, binding specificity, or localization in the cell. There are 83 OntoGlyph characters in total. There are 34 functional OntoGlyphs which contain information about the role of the molecule (e.g. cell physiology, ion transport, signaling). There are 25 binding OntoGlyphs which describe what the molecule binds (e.g. ligands, DNA, ions). The other 24 OntoGlyphs provide information about the location of the molecule within a cell (e.g. nucleus, cytoskeleton). The OntoGlyphs can be selected and manipulated to include or exclude certain characteristics from search results. The visual nature of the OntoGlyphs also facilitates pattern recognition when looking at search results. ProteoGlyphs are graphical representations of the structural and binding properties of proteins at the level of conserved domains. The protein is diagrammed as a straight horizontal line and glyphs are inserted to represent conserved domains. Each glyph is displayed to represent the relative position and length of its alignment in the protein sequence.
Accessing the database.
The database user interface is web-based and can be queried using text or accession numbers/identifiers. Since its integration with the other components of BOND, sequences have been added to interactions, molecular complexes and pathways in the results. Records include information on: BIND ID, description of the interaction/complex/pathway, publications, update records, organism, OntoGlyphs, ProteoGlyphs, and links to other databases where additional information can be found. BIND records include various viewing formats (e.g. HTML, ASN.1, XML, FASTA), various formats for exporting results (e.g. ASN.1, XML, GI list, PDF), and visualizations (e.g. Cytoscape). The exact viewing and exporting options vary depending on what type of data has been retrieved.
User statistics.
The number of Unleashed Registrants has increased 10 fold since the integration of BIND. As of December 2006 registration fell just short of 10,000. Subscribers to the commercial versions of BOND fall into six general categories; agriculture and food, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, informatics, materials and other. The biotechnology sector is the largest of these groups, holding 28% of subscriptions. Pharmaceuticals and informatics follow with 22% and 18% respectively. The United States holds the bulk of these subscriptions, 69%. Other countries with access to the commercial versions of BOND include Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, China, Korea, Germany, France, India and Australia. All of these countries fall below 6% in user share.

St. Joseph's High School (Barrie)

Saint Joseph's Catholic High School is located in Barrie, Ontario, Canada.
Recent construction.
In 2001, the school began construction of a new, two-story wing to accommodate the growing influx of students. The construction did not complete soon enough, however, and the school was soon faced with the problem of a ballooning student population in an inadequate facility. During the construction, overflow classes were relocated to portable classrooms, as well as bussed to a nearby "teaching annex", located on Bell Farm Road, approximately ten minutes from the school. Students were asked to share lockers to accommodate the space shortage. The school ran lunch periods in shifts throughout the day, as the cafeteria was ill-equipped to hold even half of its students. The wing opened in September 2003, complete with new music and art rooms, three new computer labs, a recording and green-screen studio, an extension on the existing cafeteria, a darkroom, as well as many new classrooms and hundreds of additional lockers. Unfortunately many lockers and class rooms at the school remain empty as enrollment has fallen in recent years.
The "Sandal Scandal".
In spring 2005, approximately 50 students were sent to the office for dressing inappropriately on a casual dress, or "civvies", day. Their unruly behaviour in the hall outside the main office led the vice-principals to tell them to quiet down or go outside. Misunderstanding, they thought they were told to leave because of their footwear, and so they walked out the front doors of the school. A few then re-entered the school through other doors and encouraged their friends to join them outside. As it was a warm spring day, many did, and soon approximately 100 students gathered around the front steps. In their attempts to make a media event of the situation, a few students contacted the local news outlets. All but one declined to report on the story, and the one that did displayed photographs of students holding hastily made signs reading "Jesus wore sandals; why can't we?" A small number of agitated parents contacted the school to find out what was going on, and soon the "protest" fizzled. The students returned to classes and were merely issued warning letters about appropriate dress. Subsequent retellings, including a humorous valedictory address at the June graduation ceremony, distorted and magnified the story into a mass protest by hundreds of students.
Theatre Arts program.
After a lengthy hiatus, the St. Joe's Drama Club re-formed in 2003. The student group has since undertaken many ambitious projects, including a full-length musical, an adaptation of William Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream", several variety shows, and an annual independent rock show known as "Battle of the Bands". The St. Joe's Drama Club has won several awards from the Sears Drama festival for ensemble acting, songwriting, and directing.
Past productions are as follows:
Prior to the "hiatus", St. Joe's hosted the Sears Ontario Drama Festival in 1998, in which the top 15 schools performed at Georgian College Theatre, the first time the showcase event was held outside Toronto. During workshops and social events at the school irony played a hand when a teacher pulled the plug on the music during an outdoor BBQ.
Music Program.
St. Joseph's Catholic High School is home to the St. Joe's Junior and Senior bands. They perform annually at a music competition in Collingwood and have previously received a rank of gold at the national competition in Ottawa. They have also traveled to Chicago, New York and Boston. On April 3, 2009, the St. Joe's music department held its very first 12 Hour Music Marathon, this included performances by several music classes, Junior and Senior Band, several musical ensembles, and several rock bands formed by students.
Monsignor Clair Cup.
Every year St. Joseph's High School competes with the other two Catholic High Schools in a Hockey Game in Barrie for the Monsignor Clair Cup. The competition has historically taken place between St. Joseph's and St. Peter's (St. Pete's) but in more recent years, St. Joan of Arc has been a participant. The competition is well received in the school with students being allowed to miss classes for the day to attend the game. In 2011, the Monsignor Clair Cup game took place on December 7. The annual game takes place at the Barrie Molson Centre. 
Communications Technology.
Since the Regional Communications Technology Contest began again in 2005, St. Joseph's Catholic High School has competed twice. St. Joseph's hosted the event in 2005, winning first place overall that year. In 2006, the school placed second. St. Joseph's did not compete the following year, as a teaching exchange left the Communications Technology team without a staff sponsor and organizer.
St. Joe's rowing team.
Rowing at St. Joeseph's has been a long-standing tradition. Started in 1745 by Sir. Barrie Robinson, athletes have competed in regattas across the county. Despite the long term commitment, dedicated training and positive attitude, no significant accomplishments have been made, ever. Despite its long-standing roots, the rowing team is largely considered a new addition to the athletics program as it is still awaiting its first notable victory. Confidence is held, however, that the team will manage small victories in the regatta held in Barrie, Ontario, a large deal for many. 
In 2007 the team celebrated its first appearance in the CSSRA Finals. Trevor Neelin and Nick Sarchuk placed 5th overall against teams from across Canada and the northern United States, in the Senior Boys Heavy Pair event.
The first St. Joe's team to win a race at Schoolboy was the Junior Women's Four consisting of Michelle Hayano as the coxie, and Melissa McKinnon, Courtney Horne, Sarah McGarry, and Meggie Letman in seats four through one, respectively. They qualified for semi-finals with the best time ever from a St. Joe's women's four team. They came in 5th out of 6 teams in the semi-finals after a faulty start.
Major Events.
In January 2011 the school was shut down for 2 & 1/2 days due to an unknown substance. The students were evacuated into nearby Monsignor Clair Catholic Elementary School and École Frère-André Elementary School. A total of 29 students were sent to hospital, then were released shortly after. The school was cleaned by an industrial hygienist company and the tests were inconclusive as to what chemical/substance was released. The person(s) was never found that might have released the substance, although it was suspected to be a student's doing trying to avoid exams.[http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/926190--barrie-high-school-evacuated-after-reports-of-suspicious-chemical] Some students speculate that it may also have been a teacher who detected an odd odor coming from a science room but was unaware of the science experiments taking place and called school administration.
Deaths.
Between the years of 2006-2009, there were four deaths. Two were suicide and two were accidents.

Preakness, New Jersey

Preakness is a section of Wayne located in Passaic County, New Jersey, United States.
The colt Preakness, for whom the Preakness Stakes Thoroughbred horse race at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland is named, was owned by Milton H. Sanford's Preakness Stables located at the corner of Valley Road and Preakness Avenue.
Preakness is the birthplace of Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame trainer, Barry Littlefield and his brother Fred Littlefield, a jockey who won the 1888 Preakness Stakes.
The name itself was said to have come from the Native American name Pra-qua-les for "Quail Woods" in the area. An alternative translation derives the name from "per-ukunees", which is thought to mean "young buck".

Pulsenet

PulseNet is a network run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which brings together public health and food regulatory agency laboratories around the United States. Through the network, cooperating groups can share pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) results which act as fingerprints to distinguish strains of organisms such as "E. coli" (O157:H7 and non O157), Salmonella, Shigella, Listeria, Campylobacter, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Yersinia pestis. In this way, efforts to combat infectious disease outbreaks are strengthened. Specifically, by sharing results, it is easier to identify large scale outbreaks. For example, if an outbreak of "E. coli" occurred in two distant parts of the country, PulseNet might help prove a link between the two. In such a case, the pathogen would have the same genetic fingerprint at both locations.
Due to the success of Pulsenet USA since its inception in 1996, similar networks have been established internationally in Canada (2000), the Asia Pacific (2002), Europe (2003), Latin America (2003), and the Middle East (2006). These networks collaborate under the umbrella of PulseNet International. PulseNet participants use the BioNumerics software suite for database maintenance, tiff image normalization, and analysis and pattern comparisons. 
The objectives of PulseNet International are to perform molecular surveillance of foodborne diseases at the global level in order to facilitate international outbreak detection and investigation by partnering with public health laboratories throughout the world and by building capacity for molecular surveillance of foodborne pathogens.
Additionally, the participants collaborate on the development, validation and implementation of internationally standardized subtyping methods to be used in the networks and perform collaborative studies on the geographic distribution and spread of different clones of foodborne pathogens.

Leukotriene E4

Leukotriene E4 is a cysteinyl leukotriene involved in inflammation. It is known to be produced by several types of white blood cells, including eosinophils, mast cells, tissue macrophages, and basophils, and recently was also found to be produced by platelets adhering to neutrophils. It is formed from the sequential conversion of LTC4 to LTD4 and then to LTE4, which is the final and most stable cysteinyl leukotriene. Compared to the short half lives of LTC4 and LTD4, LTE4 is relatively stable and accumulates in breath condensation, in plasma, and in urine, making it the dominate cysteinyl leukotriene detected in biologic fluids. Therefore, measurements of LTE4, especially in the urine, are commonly monitored in clinical research studies.
Increased production and excretion of LTE4 has been linked to several respiratory diseases, and urinary LTE4 levels are increased during severe asthma attacks and are especially high in people with Aspirin-induced asthma, also known as Samter’s Triad or aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). 
Studies have suggested that LTE4 works through its own distinct receptor, and although one has not yet been discovered, research is ongoing to isolated and characterize an LTE4-specific receptor.

Toca's Miracle

"Toca's Miracle" is a song by the German musical group Fragma, featuring the vocals of British singer Coco Star. Taken as the second single off the studio album "Toca", the song is actually a mashup from Star's 1996 song "I Need a Miracle" and Fragma's "Toca Me". The instrumental was written by Dirk Duderstadt, Marco Duderstadt, Ramon Zenker ("Toca Me"); the lyrics were written by Rob Davis and Victor Imbres ("I Need a Miracle"); while some of the song's production was produced by Ramon Zenker, the vocals were produced many years earlier by Imbres and Tim Orford.
The song was critically acclaimed worldwide, with many critics citing the song one of the best dance anthems of all time, praising its catchy tune. The song was a commercial success as well, remaining both Star's and Fragma's best selling single to date. The song peaked inside the top ten in countries including the United Kingdom, Norway, Italy and Australia. A music video was issued, showing Coco at an indoor soccer game.
The song was re-issued in 2008 by Tiger Records, with new remixes. The song also received mixed reviews from music critics, but managed to gain commercial success around the globe. Additionally, a new music video was issued for the single, but did not feature Star in the video. The song was then re-released in 2012 by Tiger Records. Controversy has also been raised, mostly due to the further releases and titling.
Conception.
Recording background.
In 2000, British DJ Vimto had the idea of taking the 1996 sound recording of Coco's a cappella vocals from the song "I Need a Miracle" and mixing it with the music of Fragma's "Toca Me." By amalgamating the titles, it became "Toca's Miracle." He pressed an illegal bootleg which got much attention from leading DJs. At the time, Fragma were signed to Positiva records, so a release was made. "I Need a Miracle", was originally released by Greenlight Recordings in 1996 and re-recorded for EMI/Positiva in 1997. It is noted that Coco was never a member of Fragma.
"I Need a Miracle" was written by Rob Davis (musician) and Victor Imbres. When "Coco - I Need a Miracle" was subject to a mash-up with "Toca Me", the production was by Ramon Zenker. With the interview with Zenker, he stated; "One day and [Marco gave me a rough demo with this magic plugged-guitar line which I thought was really good. I called it 'Toca Me.' Toca in Spanish means touch, so it became known as Touch Me."
Production.
Zenker stated about the production; ""I produced it as a club track. I thought it was a good idea, with the guitar sample, but I thought it was only a thing for clubs, and wouldn't really be that successful [...]" He carried on saying "They started the composition, they offered some chord lines, sequences and bass lines, and started looking for interesting sounds. I collected these, put my own ideas to it and mixed it together into a track."
Musically, the song was based on a "typical-trance" style, which features instrumentation of guitars and synthesizers. Zenker used a Roland TR909 for the drums, arpeggiated sequence from the Nord Lead, chord sounds from the Korg O5R/W and used the bass was from the Waldorf Pulse. He also used a string pad from Emu Audity 2000 and occasionally used some synth chords from the Access Virus.
While mixing both recordings, he stated he couldn't "believe" both versions fit perfectly. He mistakely concluded Coco as being on the same label as them, stating: "Fortunately, this Coco single was on Positiva, which is the same label we are on, That was very good, so Kevin from Positiva A&R sorted things out with Coco and her management, and it was very quick to find a deal to use the vocals. 'I Need A Miracle' was three years old -- a long time ago -- and 'Toca's Miracle' was more successful than both knocked together, so there was benefit for both sides."
Re-releases.
In 2008, it was announced that a re-release of "Toca's Miracle" will be release under the name "Toca's Miracle 2008". One of the remixes production is similar to the original version, but features a more "retro-rave" edit, with the song being remixed by InPetto. Inpetto's production was heavily confused with Deadmau5, where people believed it was produced by him, but this was eventually clarified. The song's composition was described as "subdued, electro-tinged sound, which betrays a marked deep house influence, 'Toca's Miracle 2008' veers perilously close to sounding classy." The song was eventually re-released in Australia as a CD Single by Tinted Records, while it was release in Europe around Spring 2008 by Tiger Records and Spinnin' Records with new artwork. Other remixes by Wideboys, Richard Durand and Wes Clarke feature little or no Fragma production. These are technically new productions of Coco-I Need a Miracle, incorrectly attributed.
In 2012, the song was re-released as "Toca's Miracle (2012 Update)". The song was issued on a compilation series which was issued by Ministry of Sound. The song was issued in late 2011 as a digital download, while a physical release was bound in early 2012. by Tiger Records.
Critical reception.
"Toca's Miracle" received positive reviews from most music critics. DJ Ron Slomowicz from About.com said ""Toca's Miracle" became one of those dance (and even club) standards - reaching the same pinnacle as Darude's "Sandstorm" and Cher's "Believe." Another review from the publication compared the work to American disc jockey Deadmau5, saying " The In Petto remix of "Toca's Miracle" so eerily resembled Deadmau5 that online leaks mistakenly credited it to him [...]" With the same publication, the song was a runner-up for being the Best Remix/Re-release of 2008. "Dancingastronaugh.net" called it "one of the more classic progressive tunes of our time."
Nick Levine from "Digital Spy" gave it a fairly mixed review, only awarding it two stars out of five. He believed that though the original version was better saying "t remained pretty much inescapable for the rest of the year, especially for those who frequented provincial nightclubs and/or cultivated a fondness for freeview video channels.", he called it "modest beginnings." He later concluded saying the song presented more "class", but criticized the use of "class" in a "Euro club banger."
Commercial performances.
"Toca Me" and "I Need a Miracle" performances.
The original version for "Toca Me" received moderate chart success before the mash-up version. The song managed to enter the top forty on the UK Singles Chart, where it peaked at number twenty. The song also entered inside the top twenty on the Irish Singles Chart, peaking at twenty as well. The song, however did not pursue the same success on the Dutch Top 100, peaking at number forty-nine.
Coco Star's song, "I Need a Miracle", entered the UK singles chart at #39 in addition to #1 on the UK DJ and Club charts in October 1997
Original edit.
The song was additionally a commercial success when it was first released. The mash-up debuted at number twenty on the Australian Singles Chart and eventually peaked at number eight for three non-consecutive weeks. The mash-up spanned the charts for eighteen weeks. The mash-up entered at number sixteen on the Norwegian Singles Chart and peaked at number two for a sole week. The mash-up only spent one week on the Italian Singles Chart, peaking at number nineteen. The track entered at eleven on the Spanish Singles Chart, where it ultimately peaked. The track re-entered on 10 May 2009 after it's re-release.
The mash-up generated generally moderate success around Europe. Toca's Miracle peaked inside the top forty in Finland, Sweden, Belgium and managed to chart in countries including Switzerland, France and The Netherlands. The track managed to debuted at number ninety-nine on the US "Billboard" Hot 100, giving moderate success in the United States.
In Coco's native United Kingdom, the mash-up peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart. The track entered with over 185,000 copies sold in its first week, becoming the highest charting single that month and was eventually certified Silver. becoming a huge success and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). As of August 2000, however, the track alone has sold over 500,000 copies in the United Kingdom.
2008 InPetto remix.
The 2008 edit received generally good commercial success. The song reached number two in Spain, a better position than the original version. The song also peaked inside the top ten in Sweden at seven, and eighteen in The Netherlands. The song peaked at ten on the New Zealand Airplay Charts and inside the top twenty on the Australian Dance Singles Chart.
To date, with the re-release, the song has reportedly sold over 3 million copies worldwide.
I Need A Miracle.
After several mixes were released worldwide, some versions have been lucky to chart on record charts around the globe. In Austria, a 2012 update version of Coco's original (known as the "Guru Project Remix") debuted at number sixty for a sole week until falling out. Then, in Belgium, a Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike Remix of Coco's 2009 version of "I Need a Miracle" was issued at charted at number thirty-seven on the Belgium Singles Chart and stayed in there for four weeks in total. It peaked at three on the Belgium Dance Charts. These recordings an entirely different sound recording of "I Need a Miracle" and are not to be confused with "Toca's Miracle".
Music videos.
The original version, which broadcast in 2000, features an indoor soccer team of girls, including Coco Star. Another team enter the locker rooms, where they look intimidating towards the other team. Both teams head towards the court and toss a coin, where Star's team kicks-off first. The opposition begin to become more aggressive or competitive towards the game, obstructing the other team. At the end of the video, it show's Star's team win the game and the opposition team losing.
The 2008 video is completely different to the 2000 video and is the only video not to feature vocalist Coco Star. The video starts with a woman in a room, lip-syncing the song, then begins to strip her clothes off and tries to kiss a man. The next shot features another woman in her bra and underwear, dancing in a supposed bathroom, with another man in the room. Another scene then shows, yet another woman on her bed, where she also has her bra and underwear. She too also lip-syncs to the song playing and starts to seduce a man, laying near the bed. The video ends with one of the woman's eye closes.
Controversy.
Disputes of title.
The song has been known for some controversy, surrounding the copyright infringement of "I Need a Miracle". One of the controversies associated with the song was the naming of the song, in which re-branding of the original song "I Need a Miracle" to Fragma's "Toca's Miracle" occurred without permission or prior agreement.
Unauthorized releases.
Many song releases of "Toca's Miracle" had been branded "illegal", because rights were never received from either act. In late 2012, CoCo Star revealed on her official Facebook page that the record companies had confused the vocal recordings and sampled the original 1996 version of "I Need a Miracle" (released on Greenlight Records), instead of the 1997 re-recording (released on EMI/Positiva). She also wrote that the agreements that were entered “are now known to be ‘Unauthorised’”. On CoCo Star’s SoundCloud page she wrote that the 2008 Inpetto remix of "Toca’s Miracle", made by the talented Duderstadt brothers, as well as other remixes, were never authorised either.
Shortly after, Kirsty Hawkshaw revealed that Fragma had never paid her royalties for her contribution to the 2006 single "Radio Waves". Legally binding contracts were never issued, and the release was illegal. She further wrote that she loves the Bastian remix of the track, released in October 2012, and that she was sure Bastian had nothing to do with “the rogue label Tiger Records”. Kirsty Hawkshaw and Coco Star have both stated that they support each other.

Brocks Fireworks

Brocks Fireworks Ltd is a manufacturer of fireworks, founded in London and subsequently based in Hemel Hempstead, Dumfriesshire and Norfolk.
Brocks was founded in 1698 in Islington by John Brock and it is the oldest British firework manufacturer. John Brock died on 5th November 1720 aged 43. In 1825 the factory was located in a residential area in Baker's Row, Whitechapel, London: it was destroyed when a boy who was ramming gunpowder into a firework accidentally created a spark which ignited it, and threw it aside as he ran out in fright. Fifty pounds of gunpowder and a large amount of saltpetre exploded immediately, blowing the roof off, setting fire to the building, and smashing every pane of glass in most of the adjoining streets.
The company moved to south London, to South Norwood and Sutton and developed an association with The Crystal Palace, devising free public displays (known as "Brock's Benefits") and adopting "Crystal Palace" as a brand name.
The 1887 and several subsequent editions of "Whitaker's Almanack" have advertisements for Brocks, under an earlier name: it provided for the Crystal Palace company, the UK War Office, Government of India, and other bodies.
The company moved to Hemel Hempstead in 1910 and stayed there until 1971, when it moved again, this time to Swaffham, Norfolk and Sanquhar, Scotland. In the 1930s, Brocks built homes and a sports club for its workers near to its site on the north eastern side of Hemel Hempstead. The street names (Ranelagh Road and Vauxhall Road) reflected earlier associations in south London. Henry Brock died in 1938 and was buried at Holy Trinity Church, Leverstock Green.
Brocks Fireworks was bought by Standard Fireworks in 1988,and Standard Fireworks were bought by the Chinese Firework Company Black Cat in 1998, but the Brocks name lasted as a brand name for some imported products from China for a while.
Brocks Fireworks Limited is now back in the UK and in the hands of UK Directors. Brocks Fireworks Limited aims are to produce high quality Pyrotechnics back in the UK and to protect the history of the UK fireworks industry.

Riksgatan

Riksgatan (Swedish: "National Street") is a street in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. Located on Helgeandsholmen, and passing between the eastern and the western buildings of the Swedish Parliament Buildings, makes it the official address of the Parliament.
In its northern end, the bridge Riksbron extends it over Norrström to Drottninggatan on Norrmalm, while the bridge Stallbron extends it south over Stallkanalen to Mynttorget on Stadsholmen. The quay Bankkajen forms a semi-circular parallel street along the western waterfront of Helgeandsholmen, while Norra Helgeandstrappan and Södra Helgeandstrappan leads to Riksplan, the open space in front of the Parliament's east façade.
The present name was made official in 1947, while the Bank of Sweden was still located in the western building. Before this the street was regarded as part of Drottninggatan. It is, arguably, the only street in the capital not own by the city, but by the Parliament.
The Parliament Building ("Riksdagshuset") was from its completion in the early 20th century subject to fiery criticism - its bombastic decorations, triumphal arches, etcetera regarded as falling short of "hemortsrätt" ("domiciliary right") in Scandinavia, the home of a more simple and fastidious taste, at the time by many regarded as something irrefutable. The building was, however, constructed to the design of Aron Johansson during the period 1892-1905, and, following the transition from a bicameral to a unicameral system in 1971, rebuilt in 1977-1983, the Bank of Sweden subsequently relocated to its present building at Brunkebergstorg in 1976 in order to house the single chamber west of Riksgatan. The communication system between the various part of the Parliament are hidden by, except the triumphal arches overpassing the street, a subterranean system of subways stretching under the bridges extending the street.

Belarusian minority in Poland

Belarusian minority in Poland is composed of 47,000 people according to the Polish census of 2011. This number decreased in the last decades from over 300,000 due to an active process of assimilation. Most of them live in the Podlaskie Voivodeship.
However, a small but unconfirmed Belarusian population is in the West Pomeranian Voivodeship in western Poland. They may been assimilated in the Polish population, but Belarusian culture has not firmly disappeared in the whole of Poland since WWII.
History.
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
Poland first acquired a Ruthenian (predominant ancestors of modern Belarusians) minority in 16th century, when after the Union of Lublin in 1569 Poland gained control over some of eastern territories formerly belonging to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Poland retained control over that region until the partitions of Poland in the late 18th century. In time, the Belarusian culture and nationality started to develop in that region, but also increasing number of people became Polonized. Later influences, particularly Lithuanization and Russification, further contributed to the blurry ethnic border and resulted in a region with many territories with significant minority of one culture or another.
1918-1939.
In 1921, at the end of the Polish-Soviet War, Belarusian territories were divided between Second Polish Republic and Soviet Russia under the terms of the Peace of Riga. Thus the newly reborn Poland gained a disputed territory, known as Kresy or West Belarus, inhabited by both Belarusians and Poles. According to the Polish census of 1921, there were around 1 million Belarusians in the country. According to Soviet sources, there were 3 million Belarusians in 1921. Most historians estimate the number of Belarusians in Poland at that time to be from 1.7 million up to 2 million. Belarusians formed 3.1% of the populations of the Second Polish Republic, mostly inhabiting the east-central voivodeships, particularly the Nowogródek Voivodeship. Belarusians consisted the majority of population of Polesie Voivodship, however most of them didn't declare themselves as Belarusians, but at Tutejsi ("Locals").
Several thousand Poles were settled in the area pursuant to the legislation of December 20, 1920. In the elections of November 1922, a Belarusian party (in the "Blok Mniejszości Narodowych" coalition) obtained 14 seats in the Polish parliament (11 of them in the lower chamber, Sejm). In the spring of 1923, Prime Minister of Poland Władysław Sikorski ordered a report on the situation of the Belarusian minority in Poland. That summer, a new regulation was passed allowing for the Belarusian language to be used officially both in courts and in schools. Obligatory teaching of the Belarusian language was introduced in all Polish gymnasia in areas inhabited by Belarusians in 1927.
In the 1921-1926 period Poland did not have a consistent policy towards its ethnic minorities. Belarusian schools, not being subsidized by the Polish government, were facing severe financial problems already by 1921. After an early period of liberalization, tensions between increasingly nationalistic Polish government and various increasingly separatist ethnic minorities started to grow, and Belarusian minority was no exception. Belarusian organization, The "Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union", was banned in 1927, and opposition to Polish government was met with state repressions. Nonetheless compared to the (larger) Ukrainian minority, Belarusian was much less politically aware and active, and thus suffered fewer repressions then the Ukrainians.
Increasingly, Belarusians in Poland faced extensive Polonization, though the suppression of Belarusian identity was not as deep compared to the Russification of Soviet Belarus across the border. After the 1930 elections in Poland, Belarusian representation in the Polish parliament was reduced and in the early 1930s the Polish government started to introduce policies intended to Polonize minorities.
In 1935, after the death of Józef Piłsudski, a new wave of repressions was released upon the minorities, with many Orthodox churches and Belarusian schools being closed. In 1938 about 100 Orthodox churches were destroyed or converted to Roman Catholic ones in the eastern parts of Poland, the majority of them in ethnically Ukrainian territories. Use of the Belarusian language was discouraged. Not a single Belarusian school survived until the spring of 1939, and only 44 schools teaching the Belarusian language still existed in Poland at the beginning of World War II.
Belarusian leadership was sent to Bereza Kartuska prison. Earlier, Belarusian political leaders reported to the League of Nations of tens of thousands being flogged by police, and subject to torture in interrogations. According to Belarusian accounts, sixty to seventy peasants were hanged daily during anti-guerrilla campaigns.
After the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and pursuant German and Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, portrayed by Soviet propaganda as 'liberation of Western Belarus and Western Ukraine', some Belarusians welcomed unification with Belorussian SSR, although attitudes of many changed after experiencing the Soviet terror. Nonetheless from 1939, with the exception of a brief period of Nazi occupation, almost all Belarusians previously living in Poland would live in the Belorussian SSR.
It was initially planned to move the capital of the Byelorussian SSR to Vilnius. However, the same year Joseph Stalin ordered that the city and surrounding region be transferred to Lithuania, which some months later was also invaded by Soviet Union and became a new Soviet Republic - Lithuanian SSR. Minsk therefore was proclaimed the capital of the enlarged Byelorussian SSR. The borders of the BSSR were again altered somewhat after the war (notably the largely Polish area around the city of Białystok was returned to Poland) but in general they coincide with the borders of the modern Republic of Belarus.
After entering the Soviet Union, the people of Western Belarus, especially those who favored democracy and Belarusian independence, immediately faced violent repression from the NKVD, which may explain incidents of local collaboration with Germans during the Nazi occupation of Belarus. Refugees from Western Belarus were arrested by Soviet authorities and frequently executed, Kurapaty graves contain many products from Poland - cloths, shoes. The most prominent victim of NKVD was the activist and linguist Branislaw Tarashkyevich.
1989 - present.
The Belarusian minority has been active in political life in Poland since 1989.
In the 2006 elections to the Podlasie Sejmik, the Białoruski Komitet Wyborczy (Belarusian Electoral Committee) received 7,914 votes (2.05%), however this was not enough to receive any seats in the Council. The most votes from this list were for Jan Czykwin (2,405), Eugeniusz Wappa (1,669) and Eugeniusz Mironowicz (1,119).
When the local elections were repeated in the region on 20 May 2007, the Belarusians again submitted their own electoral committee, which for the first time had several Lithuanians running on the list, in their region of Sejny and Punsk.
There's an unknown number of Belarusians in northwest Poland, but some Polish Belarusians were relocated there by the Soviet invasion of Germany in April 1945 and the captured lands of formerly German Pomerania was annexed by Poland.

Salmon River (Nova Scotia)

The Salmon River is a Canadian river in central Nova Scotia's Colchester County.
Rising in the Cobequid Hills in the central-northeastern part of the county, the river descends through a broad glacial valley at the head of Cobequid Bay, the eastern extremity of the Bay of Fundy. The river discharges into the bay at a point between Lower Truro and Lower Onslow, the historic head of navigation.
A tidal bore is observed daily on the lower part of the river to the head of the tide at Truro.
The river is known for ice jams during the spring freshet. Poor planning has led to urban sprawl in Truro and the neighbouring areas of the county impacting the river's floodplain. During the 1869 Saxby Gale, the entire floodplain and significant areas of Truro were inundated by ocean waters.
The community of Salmon River takes its name from the river.

Blessed Edward Jones (died 6 May 1590) was born in the diocese of St Asaph and baptised an Anglican. He was received into the Catholic Church in Reims in 1587 and ordained priest in 1588. He returned to England and was arrested in Fleet Street in 1590. Tortured in the Tower, he made a skilful defence, for which the court complimented him. This, however, did not stop him being convicted of high treason. He was hanged, drawn and quartered on 6 May 1590, opposite the grocer’s shop where he had been captured.

<doc id="9774218" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9774218" title="Religious views on the self">
Religious views on the self

Religious views on the self vary widely. The self is a complex and core subject in many forms of spirituality. Two types of self are commonly considered - the self that is the ego, also called the learned, superficial self of mind and body, "false self", an egoic creation, and the Self which is sometimes called the "True Self", the "Observing Self", or the "Witness".
Discussion.
Human beings have a self—that is, they are able to look back on themselves as both subjects and objects in the universe. Ultimately, this brings questions about who we are and the nature of our own importance. Traditions such as Buddhism see the apparent self (our identification as souls, minds, bodies and egos) as a "grasping-after" self—i.e., inasmuch as one has a "self," one has it only through a deluded attempt to shore it up. Christianity also sees the true self negatively, distorted through sin: 'The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?' (Jeremiah 17:9)Alternately, Each human self or spirit is a unique, creation by God. The "desperately wicked self" is the sinful self that has chosen to be "curved back upon itself", but ever with the potential or changing and (by God's grace) turning toward "'new life', opened out to love of God and neighbor"
See Albert Outler as quoted in "Outler on the Holy Spirit" by George Aikinson, Bristol House, 2004 p.54. and p.87. 
According to Marcia, identity comes from both political and religious views. He also identified exploration and commitmAlternaent as interactive parts of identity formation, which includes religious identity. Erik Erikson compared faith with doubt and found that healthy adults take heed to their spiritual side.
One description of spirituality is the self's search for "ultimate meaning" through an independent comprehension of the sacred. Spiritual identity appears when the symbolic religious and spiritual of a culture is found by individuals in the setting of their own life. There can be different types of spiritual self because it is determined on one's life and experiences. Another definition of spiritual identity is " a persistent sense of self that addresses ultimate questions about the nature, purpose, and meaning of life, resulting in behaviors that are consonant with the individual’s core values." 
Another description of Mind, body, soul, and spirit is a holism of one inner self being of one whole. It all combines together as one whole instead of different parts. Individuals one thoughts, one feeling, one breathing is all completed and occurs as one whole. GT </truth knowledge of one self, and the universe.
Maslow's theory.
According to Abraham Maslow's theory of "self-actualization needs: to find self fulfillment and realize one's potential." He thought that once a person realizes what they are capable of it gives them a motivation to do whatever they intend.
Bandura.
Albert Bandura believed in "self-efficacy, which refers to a person's learned expectations of success." This theory states that people are bound to complete a task more effectively if they think they will succeed. If a person is more negative about their abilities the chances of them completing the task accordingly are less.
Winnicott.
D. W. Winnicott was of the opinion that psychopathology was in large part generated by an overvaluation of the false self, at the expense of the true self which was linked to the individual's own creativity.
Rogers on self and self-concept.
Carl Rogers' theory is that "people use the term self concept to refer to all the information and beliefs you have as an individual regarding your own nature, unique qualities, and typical behaviors." Rogers thought that people develop through relationships with others and also in relation to themselves. An encouraging environment helps people towards this development.
Commenting on his clients' search for a real self, Rogers quoted with approval Kierkegaard's statement that "the most common despair is to be in despair at not choosing, or willing, to be oneself; but that the deepest form of despair is to choose 'to be another than himself'. On the other hand, 'to will to be that self which one truly is, is indeed the opposite of despair'".
The observing self.
The "Visible" self is mainly dependent on a subjective view, that is, as viewed from the specific self. For example: looking in the mirror, we perceive the reflection to be our true "self"...
The witnessing self.
Ken Wilber describes the Witnessing (or Observing) Self in the following terms: 
He adds that the Self is not an Emergent, but an aspect present from the start as the basic form of awareness, but which becomes increasingly obvious and self-aware "as growth and transcendence matures." As Depth increases, consciousness shines forth more noticeably, until:
In a similar vein, Evelyn Underhill states: "It is clear that under ordinary conditions, and save for sudden gusts of "Transcendental Feeling" induced by some saving madness such as Religion, Art, or Love, the superficial self knows nothing of the attitude of this silent watcher—this "Dweller in the Innermost"—towards the incoming messages of the external world: nor of the activities which they awake in it. Concentrated on the sense-world, and the messages she receives from it, she knows nothing of the relations which exist between this subject and the unattainable Object of all thought. But by a deliberate inattention to the messages of the senses, such as that which is induced by contemplation, the mystic can bring the ground of the soul, the seat of "Transcendental Feeling," within the area of consciousness: making it amenable to the activity of the will. Thus becoming unaware of his usual and largely fictitious "external world," another and more substantial set of perceptions, which never have their chance under normal conditions, rise to the surface. Sometimes these unite with the normal reasoning faculties. More often, they supersede them. Some such exchange, such "losing to find," appears to be necessary, if man's transcendental powers are to have their full chance."

Flatbed truck

A flatbed truck (or flatbed lorry in British English) is a type of truck which can be either articulated or rigid. As the name suggests, it has an entirely flat, level 'bed' body with no sides or roof. This allows for quick and easy loading of goods, and consequently they are used to transport heavy loads that are not delicate or vulnerable to precipitation, such as construction equipment, and also for abnormal loads that require more space than is available on a closed body.
Railway flatbeds.
Railways also employ flatbed trucks in engineering trains and freight trains. In Britain and the Commonwealth the term "Bogie Flat" is often applied to a bogie flatbed truck. Although less common, flatbed railway trucks on rigid frames and axles are sometimes used, with both 4-wheel and 6-wheel versions being extant. In British English, the term 'truck' most commonly relates to railway vehicles, with the word 'lorry' more commonly applied to road vehicles.

The Blossoms

The Blossoms are an American girl-group group that initially originated from California. During their height of success in the 1960s, the group's lineup most famously consisted of Darlene Love, Fanita James, and Jean King. 
Although the group had a recording career in their own right, they was most famously known for being the group to actually record the #1 hit "He's a Rebel" (which producer Phil Spector credited to The Crystals), and for providing backing vocals for many of the biggest hits of the 1960s.
It has been said that The Blossoms were to the American West Coast what The Sweet Inspirations were to the East Coast and The Andantes were for Motown.
History.
Early Years: Formation, Name and Lineup Changes, and inclusion of Darlene Love.
Their career began in Los Angeles, California, while still in high school in 1954. Originally the group was a sextet of young girls singing for fun. Calling themselves The Dreamers the group originally sang spirituals since two of the members had parents who were against their daughters singing secular rhythm and blues music popular on the radio during the early 1950s.
Fanita Barrett (later known as Fanita James), Gloria Jones, Jewel Cobbs, Pat Howard and twin sisters Annette and Nanette Williams all came from musical backgrounds. The twins had taken vocal and dancing lessons as youngsters. Fanita's brother Ronald was already a success with his vocal group, The Meadowlarks. The Dreamers were introduced to local musicians through Dexter Tisby, then successful with his own group The Penguins who had a hit with "Earth Angel".
The Dreamers joined Richard Berry in the studio and during 1955 and 1956 made several recordings for Flair and RPM Records. Among them was a version of Harry Warren and Mac Gordon's "At Last" and several of Richard Berry's compositions: "Together", "Wait For Me", and "Daddy, Daddy". The Dreamers gained attention as versatile singers and began to get studio work singing backup for other artists as well as recording a few singles of their own as The Dreamers.
The Dreamers signed with Capitol Records where one of the executives, noticing their different skin tones, said they looked like a bouquet; which is how they became The Blossoms. Even though signing to Capitol was considered a step up, the group's stay at Capitol was short - yielding only three singles - none of which made the charts. The Blossoms also underwent significant changes at this time. By 1958 Nanette was married, pregnant, and planning a leave of absence from the group.
Darlene Wright (later known as Darlene Love) replaced Nanette and was selected to be the lead, which the ensemble-based Blossoms had not previously had. The addition of Wright would change the style of the group but chart success was still elusive, despite Darlene's unique presence as lead, on songs like "No Other Love" for Capitol in 1958, "Sugarbeat" for RCA (as The Playgirls) in 1960 and "Write Me A Letter" for Challenge in 1961.
The 1960s: Phil Spector, Backing Vocalists, The Crystals, and Solo Success.
During the summer of 1962, The Blossoms finally emerged successful on the charts, although their biggest hit song, "He's a Rebel", would not be credited to them.
Then-unknown producer Phil Spector had learned that Vikki Carr was soon to record "He's a Rebel" for Liberty Records as her debut single, and decided he had to rush his own version to stores. Since The Crystals (his biggest girl group at the time) were touring on the east coast at the time, The Blossoms were instead brought in to record the track. Prior to this, Spector had been using The Blossoms to contribute backing vocals behind many of his artist's tracks including the Crystals' "Da Doo Ron Ron".
However, when Spector released the record, the song was instead credited to The Crystals (much to the dismay of the actual Crystals). The Blossoms in turn only received a meager session fee (Darlene Love states they were paid "triple scale") and are not credited for contributing to the record. The song peaked at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and firmly established Spector as a force to be reckoned with in the music industry. Over the next three years, the Blossoms, with Darlene as lead, would be the favored singers on all of Spector's sessions recorded in California. 
Darlene and Fanita sang with Bobby Sheen as Bob B. Soxx & the Blue Jeans. This combo achieved hit singles for Spector, including a version of the Disney classic "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah."
Although The Blossoms were attempting to establish themselves as primary artists, they still contributed backing vocals behind many of the biggest hits of the 1960s including The Ronettes' "Be My Baby", Shelley Fabares' "Johnny Angel", and The Blossoms lead singer Darlene Love's solo efforts (which included "He's Sure the Boy I Love" although again Spector credited the song to The Crystals). 
Fabares stated in an interview quoted in "The Billboard Book of #1 Hits" that her strongest memory of that recording session was the "beautiful voices of the backup singers". 
In 1964, the group was reduced to a trio of Darlene, Fanita, and newcomer Jean King and were a featured part of a relatively successful weekly rock'n'roll television program called "Shindig!". The Blossoms used their vocal versatility to their advantage, singing in various styles behind a variety of artists including Patty Duke, Shelley Fabares and Marvin Gaye. 
The Blossoms appeared in 1964's "The T.A.M.I. Show" providing backup vocals and dancing for all of Marvin Gaye's songs; their name appeared in the opening credits, but they were not introduced. They are later seen at stage left encouraging an exhausted James Brown to take the stage one last time after his climactic performance. In 1968 they appeared in the "Elvis (NBC TV Special)". The Blossoms also provided backing vocals to Doris Day's "Move Over, Darling" from the film of the same name. They resumed recording under their own name later in the 1960s for labels such as Reprise, Ode, and MGM. While with Ode, they recorded a pop-gospel version of Laura Nyro's "Stoney End", which was first released in 1967 as the B-side to the "Wonderful" single, and then again in 1969 as an A-side single. They recorded their only album, "Shockwave", in 1972 for Lion Records.
1970s-Present: Lineup Changes, Post-Breakup, Revival, and "20 Feet From Stardom".
Darlene eventually left The Blossoms in 1974 and Jean King died of a heart attack in Las Vegas in 1983. Fanita kept The Blossoms going with varying personnel, backing Tom Jones, and performing on the Las Vegas circuit until 1990 when she became a backing singer for Doris Kenner Jackson of The Shirelles. Darlene stayed out of the music business for about five years after a brief reunion with Phil Spector in late 1974. She made a comeback in 1981 and two years later was starring in "Leader of the Pack", the Broadway musical based on the life of songwriter Ellie Greenwich. Darlene began a film acting career portraying Trish in the "Lethal Weapon" movie series. She also had her own one-woman show "Darlene Love: Portrait of a Woman" at The Bottom Line in New York City. Darlene is also remembered for her hit "Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)" from the 1963 album "A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector".
Following Doris Kenner Jackson’s death in 2000 from breast cancer, Fanita revived The Blossoms with original member Gloria Jones and a new third member.
In 2013, The Blossoms (namely Darlene Love, Fanita James, Edna Wright, and Gloria Jones) were highlighted in the oscar-winning documentary "20 Feet From Stardom", in which it was revealed that they also sang backing vocals for Bobby "Boris" Pickett's "Monster Mash", Frank Sinatra's version of "That's Life", and Betty Everett's "The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)".

Hardware virtualization

Computer hardware virtualization is the virtualization of computers or operating systems. It hides the physical characteristics of a computing platform from users, instead showing another abstract computing platform. At its origins, the software that controlled virtualization was called a "control program", but the terms "hypervisor" or "virtual machine monitor" are now preferred.
Concept.
The term "virtualization" was coined in the 1960s to refer to a virtual machine (sometimes called "pseudo machine"), a term which itself dates from the experimental IBM M44/44X system. The creation and management of virtual machines has been called "platform virtualization", or "server virtualization", more recently.
Platform virtualization is performed on a given hardware platform by "host" software (a "control program"), which creates a simulated computer environment, a "virtual machine" (VM), for its "guest" software. The guest software is not limited to user applications; many hosts allow the execution of complete operating systems. The guest software executes as if it were running directly on the physical hardware, with several notable caveats. Access to physical system resources (such as the network access, display, keyboard, and disk storage) is generally managed at a more restrictive level than the "host" processor and system-memory. Guests are often restricted from accessing specific peripheral devices, or may be limited to a subset of the device's native capabilities, depending on the hardware access policy implemented by the virtualization host.
Virtualization often exacts performance penalties, both in resources required to run the hypervisor, and as well as in reduced performance on the virtual machine compared to running native on the physical machine.
Reasons for virtualization.
However, when multiple VMs are concurrently running on the same physical host, each VM may exhibit a varying and unstable performance, which highly depends on the workload imposed on the system by other VMs, unless proper techniques are used for temporal isolation among virtual machines.
There are several approaches to platform virtualization.
Examples of virtualization scenarios:
Full virtualization.
In full virtualization, the virtual machine simulates enough hardware to allow an unmodified "guest" OS (one designed for the same instruction set) to be run in isolation. This approach was pioneered in 1966 with the IBM CP-40 and CP-67, predecessors of the VM family. Examples outside the mainframe field include Parallels Workstation, Parallels Desktop for Mac, VirtualBox, Virtual Iron, Oracle VM, Virtual PC, Virtual Server, Hyper-V, VMware Workstation, VMware Server (formerly GSX Server), QEMU, Adeos, Mac-on-Linux, Win4BSD, Win4Lin Pro, and Egenera vBlade technology.
Hardware-assisted virtualization.
In hardware-assisted virtualization, the hardware provides architectural support that facilitates building a virtual machine monitor and allows guest OSes to be run in isolation. Hardware-assisted virtualization was first introduced on the IBM System/370 in 1972, for use with VM/370, the first virtual machine operating system. In 2005 and 2006, Intel and AMD provided additional hardware to support virtualization. Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation) added similar features in their UltraSPARC T-Series processors in 2005. Examples of virtualization platforms adapted to such hardware include Linux KVM, VMware Workstation, VMware Fusion, Microsoft Hyper-V, Microsoft Virtual PC, Xen, Parallels Desktop for Mac, Oracle VM Server for SPARC, VirtualBox and Parallels Workstation.
In 2006 first-generation 32- and 64-bit x86 hardware support was found rarely to offer performance advantages over software virtualization.
Partial virtualization.
In partial virtualization, including address space virtualization, the virtual machine simulates multiple instances of much of an underlying hardware environment, particularly address spaces. Usually, this means that entire operating systems cannot run in the virtual machine – which would be the sign of full virtualization – but that many applications can run. A key form of partial virtualization is address space virtualization, in which each virtual machine consists of an independent address space. This capability requires address relocation hardware, and has been present in most practical examples of partial virtualization.
Partial virtualization was an important historical milestone on the way to full virtualization. It was used in the first-generation time-sharing system CTSS, in the IBM M44/44X experimental paging system, and arguably systems like MVS and the Commodore 64 (a couple of 'task switch' programs). The term could also be used to describe any operating system that provides separate address spaces for individual users or processes, including many that today would not be considered virtual machine systems. Experience with partial virtualization, and its limitations, led to the creation of the first full virtualization system (IBM's CP-40, the first iteration of CP/CMS which would eventually become IBM's VM family). (Many more recent systems, such as Microsoft Windows and Linux, as well as the remaining categories below, also use this basic approach.)
Partial virtualization is significantly easier to implement than full virtualization. It has often provided useful, robust virtual machines, capable of supporting important applications. Partial virtualization has proven highly successful for sharing computer resources among multiple users.
However, in comparison with full virtualization, its drawback is in situations requiring backward compatibility or portability. It can be hard to anticipate precisely which features have been used by a given application. If certain hardware features are not simulated, then any software using those features will fail.
Paravirtualization.
In paravirtualization, the virtual machine does not necessarily simulate hardware, but instead (or in addition) offers a special API that can only be used by modifying the "guest" OS. For this to be possible, the "guest" OS's source code must be available. If the source code is available, it is sufficient to replace sensitive instructions with calls to VMM APIs (e.g.: "cli" with "vm_handle_cli()"), then re-compile the OS and use the new binaries. This system call to the hypervisor is called a "hypercall" in TRANGO and Xen; it is implemented via a DIAG ("diagnose") hardware instruction in IBM's CMS under VM (which was the origin of the term "hypervisor"). Examples include IBM's LPARs, Win4Lin 9x, Sun's Logical Domains, z/VM, and TRANGO.
Operating system-level virtualization.
In operating system-level virtualization, a physical server is virtualized at the operating system level, enabling multiple isolated and secure virtualized servers to run on a single physical server. The "guest" OS environments share the same OS as the host system – i.e. the same OS kernel is used to implement the "guest" environments. Applications running in a given "guest" environment view it as a stand-alone system. The pioneer implementation was FreeBSD jails; other examples include Solaris Containers, OpenVZ, Linux-VServer, LXC, AIX Workload Partitions, Parallels Virtuozzo Containers, and iCore Virtual Accounts.
Hardware virtualization disaster recovery.
A disaster recovery (DR) plan is good business practice for a hardware virtualization platform solution. DR of a virtualization environment can ensure high rate of availability during a wide range of situations that disrupt normal business operations. Continued operations of VMs is mission critical and a DR can compensate for concerns of hardware performance and maintenance requirements. A hardware virtualization DR environment will involve hardware and software protection solutions based on business continuity needs.

Binali Yıldırım

Binali Yıldırım (born 1955) is a Turkish politician and the former Minister of Transport, Maritime and Communication of Turkey and a MP for Izmir of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).
Born in Refahiye, Erzincan Province to a Kurdish family originally from Ağrı, Yıldırım was educated at the Istanbul Technical University's School of Maritime in Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering and in 1991 he graduated from the World Maritime University with a Master of Science degree in Maritime Safety and Environmental Protection. After graduation, Yıldırım served as the director general of the Istanbul Fast Ferries Company (İDO) from 1994 to 2000 while the current Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was mayor of Istanbul.
He entered politics and became a co-founder of the Justice and Development Party in August 2001. During his term of transport minister, Turkey met with high-speed rail lines. Under his leadership, Turkey constructed high-speed rail between Ankara-Eskişehir and Ankara-Konya. Also Eskisehir-Istanbul line is under construction to connect Istanbul and Ankara. The project collapsed after the fatal derailment of a train in Pamukova, Sakarya Province on 22 July 2004 during one of the first journeys between Istanbul and Eskişehir. Calls for Yıldırım's resignation followed the incident.
His repeated appointment to the ministry was declared by Prime Minister Erdoğan on 6 July 2011 with other members of the new cabinet. He was removed from office on 25 December 2013 in a cabinet reshuffle.
A photograph of Yıldırım's veiled wife seated separately from him during a business lunch went viral and produced an outcry in Turkey in 2005, many criticizing him for sexism. On another occasion, he commented that he did not attend Boğaziçi University in his youth because he "saw boys and girls sitting and talking together in the university's yard" and found the genders intermixing unacceptable. As the minister of communications, Yıldırım has also been the source of numerous other controversies, including replying to criticisms about government surveillance of phone lines with, "If you are not up to anything illegal, don't worry about surveillance."
Yıldırım was the unsuccessful AKP candidate for the mayor of İzmir against incumbent Aziz Kocaoğlu in the 2014 local elections in Turkey.

British Film Designers Guild

"(Also known as Designer's Guild or B.F.D.G. and can be seen after a member's name as a professional certification abbreviation)"
A society of British Film Directors and Designers was founded in 1946, for the betterment of the Design in British Films. Out of this society grew the Guild of Film Art Directors, and the present British Film Designers Guild, who now include in their membership all the various branches of the Art Department. They are not a trade union. The British equivalent of the Art Directors Guild (of America), although smaller in size are one of the key organisations in the Cine Guilds of Great Britain that work directly with the UK Government: Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport. 
This Guild is presented primarily to assist Producers and others to select Department members who will maintain the highest standards of Art Direction, even on the smallest of productions, and whose knowledge, experience and talent have been proven to be the highest in a medium where four-fifths of the spectators' attention is visual.
The British Film Designers Guild has members in every grade of the art department, from draughtspersons to costume designers, set decorators to production designers, and was formed with the aim of raising the standards and the profile of the art department and protecting the interest of its members.
Art Department positions.
The hierarchy in the United Kingdom does have some title variants with job descriptions. Here is a guide to the main positions within each area, as there are many alternatives dependent on the film requirements and to which country the film is based in. Some titles vary like for example Draughtsman "UK", to Set Designer or Draftsman "USA" [http://www.wiki.artdirectors.org/~wiki2/index.php?title=Set_Designer].
The Production Designer is the head of various departments, Art, Construction, Decorating, Property & Prop Making. Here is a guide to the main positions within each area.
Other titles include Visual Effects art director, Vehicles art director, Locations art director, Concept artist "(Illustrator U.S.)", Storyboard artist, Graphic designer, Sign writer or Lettering artist, Model maker, Armourer, Greensman "(Greenskeeper U.S.)", Drapes master and Scenic artist.

Collecting Society.
This Society was formed out of work done within the Guild to benefit members and has since grown to assist many other departments within film production. 
The BFDG no longer operates as a collecting society, after a reorganising of its core business model. They are proud to have championed the establishment of the principles behind "Copyright" and the definition of "Authors" within the Film and Television Industries, and to have paved the way for residuals to be paid to Key UK based technicians.

Stan Benjamin

Alfred Stanley "Stan" Benjamin (May 20, 1914 – December 24, 2009) was a right fielder in Major League Baseball for five seasons; four with the Philadelphia Phillies (–), of the National League (NL), and one with the Cleveland Indians (), of the American League (AL). The 6' 2", 194 lb. Benjamin batted and threw right-handed, and was born in Framingham, Massachusetts. After graduating from high school, he attended Western Maryland College, now known as McDaniel College, where he played baseball, basketball, and football.
In addition to his major league playing career, he played in minor league baseball for ten seasons. He began at the age of 23, with the Thomasville Orioles of the Georgia-Florida League in 1937, and finished as the player-manager for the Fresno Cardinals of the California League in 1948. During that time, he played in 955 minor league games, and batted .304, and hit 52 home runs. In the early 1940s, he was an assistant football coach at Northeastern University. Later, during his minor league career, he began coaching high school football, part-time, in his home town of Framingham, and then full-time once his playing and managing career ended. 
Starting in 1948, he was the head baseball coach and assistant football coach for Greenfield High School in Greenfield, Massachusetts, and took over the head football coaching duties in 1958. He held both positions, in addition to being a physical education teacher for a local middle school and part-time basketball referee until 1964. In 1965, he was hired as a talent scout for the Houston Astros, a job he held for nearly 40 years. It was his evaluation of Jeff Bagwell that led the Astros to acquire him from the Boston Red Sox for Larry Andersen.
Early life.
Born on May 20, 1914, in Framingham, Massachusetts, Benjamin graduated from Framingham High School in 1932, and later attended Western Maryland College, later renamed McDaniel College, on an athletic scholarship. He played football, basketball, and baseball and claimed to have once competed against Ohio State University track star and Olympic gold medalist Jesse Owens. When he was an end on the college’s football team, he was presented with the game ball autographed by his teammates after a 12–6 victory over Boston College.
Career.
Minor leagues.
Benjamin signed his first professional baseball contract with the Thomasville Orioles of the Class D minor league baseball Georgia-Florida League in 1937. He played for this team for the 1937 and 1938 seasons as their third baseman. In 1937, he batted .310, and hit one home run. In 97 games played during the 1938 season, he batted .348, hit 32 doubles, 12 triples, and three home runs. For the 1939 season, he joined the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Class A1 Southern Association as an outfielder; he batted .323, and hit 27 doubles, eight triples, and five home runs in 135 games played. It was at the conclusion of this minor league season, that he became a late-season acquisition of the Philadelphia Phillies.
Major leagues.
Benjamin made his Major League Baseball debut on September 16, 1939, with the Phillies, and appeared in 12 games, fielding a variety of positions, including all three outfield positions, and third base as well. He had 50 at bats that season, and collected seven hits for a .140 batting average.
The next season, he was optioned by the Phillies to the Baltimore Orioles of the Class AA International League, one of their minor league affiliates, as an outfielder. During the 1940 season, he played in 108 games, batted .304, and hit 16 doubles, seven triples, and 11 home runs. At the conclusion of this season, he was a late-season call-up by the Phillies. He played in eight games and had two hits in nine at bats for a .222 batting average.
His most productive major league season came in 1941, when he played a full season with the Phillies. He posted career-highs in home runs (3), RBIs (27), runs scored (47), hits (113), doubles (20), triples (7), stolen bases (17) and games played (129). In a game against the New York Giants on June 28, Benjamin singled to bring home the game-winning run in bottom of the 12th inning. On July 1, he again produced a game-winning single, this time in the bottom of the tenth inning, defeating the Brooklyn Dodgers. He began the 1942 season with the Phillies and batted .224 in 78 games before being sold, on August 5, to the Louisville Colonels, a Class AA American Association affiliate of the Boston Red Sox.
Return to the minors.
Benjamin finished the 1942 season with the Colonels as their third baseman. He appeared in 38 games, hit three home runs, and had a .303 batting average. Before the 1943 season, the Red Sox were in need of more outfielders, so manager Joe Cronin gave Benjamin a tryout in mid-March; however, he was not signed, and he continued to play with the Colonels, moving back to the outfield. In 123 games played, he hit just .237, and did not hit a home run. 
He returned to the Baltimore Orioles of the International League for the 1944 season, which had switched its major league affiliation to the Cleveland Indians. He enjoyed a resurgence in his offensive statistics that season, as his batting average rose to .301, and he hit 24 doubles, eight triples, and 12 home runs in 133 games played. The Indians called up Benjamin for the 1945 season, and even though he was part of their regular roster, he appeared in only 14 games, batting .333. On March 26, 1946, he was released by the Cleveland Indians, and he would never appear in another major league game. In his five-season major league career, Benjamin hit .229 with five home runs and 41 RBIs in 241 games. 
He played for and managed the Nazareth Cement Dusters of the Class D North Atlantic League. He played several different positions that season, including two games at pitcher. He batted .312 and hit four home runs during his only season with the Cement Dusters. Benjamin played for several different teams in 1947, beginning the season with the Houston Buffaloes, a St. Louis Cardinals affiliate, but later joined the San Antonio Missions, a St. Louis Browns affiliate. Both teams were in the Texas League. Late in the season, the Browns promoted him to their Class AAA team, the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association. In 1948, he played for, and managed, the Fresno Cardinals of the Class C California League, an affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals. In 125 games played that season, he batted .326 and hit 27 doubles, five triples, and nine home runs. After the season completed, he retired as a player.
Post-playing career.
High school athletics.
After his baseball playing career ended, he moved to Greenfield, Massachusetts, and became an assistant football coach at Greenfield High School, while also working as a physical education teacher at a near-by middle school. Benjamin was Greenfield’s head football coach from 1958 to 1964, as well as the head baseball coach from 1948 to 1964. He coached the baseball team to several Western Massachusetts championships. Among the other duties, he also refereed high school and college basketball games in New England, as well as working as an assistant football coach at Deerfield Academy in 1964 and 1965. He was also an assistant football coach for Northeastern University in the early 1940s.
Scouting career.
Benjamin began his career as a talent scout for the Houston Astros in 1965, and stayed in that capacity until retiring in 2002. During his time with the Astros franchise he scouted amateur players in the New England region, as well as the American League East teams and their minor league affiliates. He later became the team's scouting supervisor for the Northeast. He also scouted major league teams during spring training in Florida and spent many summer evenings evaluating some of the nation’s best college players in the Cape Cod Baseball League.
In 1970, Mike Flanagan was suffering arm problems, and many scouts decided that he did not have a future baseball career, but he could hit well, so Benjamin suggested to the Astros that they could use him in that capacity and wait to see if his arm would recuperate. The Astros drafted Flanagan, but he decided not to sign, and instead attended University of Massachusetts Amherst on a baseball scholarship. During the 1990 season, the Astros were approached by the Boston Red Sox, who needed pitching and were interested in Larry Andersen. Benjamin recommended that they ask for Red Sox minor leaguer Jeff Bagwell in return. The Astros were hesitant initially due to Bagwell's low home run totals, but Benjamin convinced them by explaining that his numbers were deceiving due to the large ballpark that he played in.
Personal life.
Benjamin was married to his wife Barbara, maiden name Hall, from 1941 until her death 54 years later in 1995. She was attending Framingham State Teachers College when they met, and school rules forbade female students from getting married or they faced expulsion. Town records didn't publish marriages until after January 1, each year, so the couple got married at 1 a.m. on New Year’s Day 1941 at her home in Raynham, Massachusetts. This prevented the school from learning about her marriage until after she had graduated. The Benjamins had one son, Richard, and three daughters, Nancy, Janice, and Joanne; as well as 12 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.
Benjamin died at the age of 95, of heart failure, in his daughter's home on December 24, 2009, in Harwich, Massachusetts. He is interred at Green River Cemetery in Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Benjamin was a member of both the McDaniel College and Massachusetts Baseball Coaches Association hall of fame, and in 2008, he received a special recognition award from the Professional Baseball Scouts Foundation. Tal Smith, Astros' president of baseball operations, said of Benjamin, “Stan’s positive evaluation of Bagwell was definitely a catalyst in our taking him... He was a vital cog in our organization who had the ability to convey his opinion in a precise manner. You always knew where you stood with him. He was a longtime employee, but more important, a longtime friend.’’ Smith also called him a "keen judge of talent."

Kusamono and shitakusa

Kusamono (literally "grass thing") and shitakusa (literally "undergrass") are a potted collection of plants designed to either be viewed in accompaniment with bonsai, or alone. Normally the term "kusamono" is used when the planting is displayed as the center of attention, while the term "shitakusa" is used for plantings that accompany bonsai displays. In contrast to underplantings (which are potted in with the bonsai), kusamono and shitakusa are displayed separately in special pots, driftwood, or even stones. 
Plants used are typically moss, grass, lichen, small flowers, bamboo, or bulbs, that may heighten the beauty or reflect a certain season. While traditionally in Japan, plants gathered from mountains contributed to the bulk of companion plantings, modern use has extended to more creative and artistic design.

Biomass heating system

Biomass heating systems generate heat from biomass.<br>
The systems fall under the categories of:
Benefits of biomass heating.
The use of biomass in heating systems is beneficial because it uses agricultural, forest, urban and industrial residues and waste to produce heat and electricity with less effect on the environment than fossil fuels. This type of energy production has a limited long term effect on the environment because the carbon in biomass is part of the natural carbon cycle; while the carbon in fossil fuels is not, and permanently adds carbon to the environment when burned for fuel (carbon footprint). Historically, before the use of fossil fuels in significant quantities, biomass in the form of wood fuel provided most of humanity's heating.
Drawbacks of biomass heating.
On a large scale, the use of biomass takes agricultural land out of food production, reduces the carbon sequestration capacity of forests, and extracts nutrients from the soil. Combustion of biomass creates air pollutants and adds significant quantities of carbon to the atmosphere that may not be returned to the soil for many decades.
Using biomass as a fuel produces air pollution in the form of carbon monoxide, NOx (nitrogen oxides), VOCs (volatile organic compounds), particulates and other pollutants, in some cases at levels above those from traditional fuel sources such as coal or natural gas. Black carbon – a pollutant created by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass – is possibly the second largest contributor to global warming. In 2009 a Swedish study of the giant brown haze that periodically covers large areas in South Asia determined that it had been principally produced by biomass burning, and to a lesser extent by fossil-fuel burning. Researchers measured a significant concentration of 14C, which is associated with recent plant life rather than with fossil fuels.
On combustion, the carbon from biomass is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2). The amount of carbon stored in dry wood is approximately 50% by weight. When from agricultural sources, plant matter used as a fuel can be replaced by planting for new growth. When the biomass is from forests, the time to recapture the carbon stored is generally longer, and the carbon storage capacity of the forest may be reduced overall if destructive forestry techniques are employed.
The biomass-is-carbon-neutral proposal put forward in the early 1990s has been superseded by more recent science that recognizes that mature, intact forests sequester carbon more effectively than cut-over areas. When a tree’s carbon is released into the atmosphere in a single pulse, it contributes to climate change much more than woodland timber rotting slowly over decades. Current studies indicate that "even after 50 years the forest has not recovered to its initial carbon storage" and "the optimal strategy is likely to be protection of the standing forest".
Biomass heating in our world.
The oil price increases since 2003 and consequent price increases for natural gas and coal have increased the value of biomass for heat generation. Forest renderings, agricultural waste, and crops grown specifically for energy production become competitive as the prices of energy dense fossil fuels rise. Efforts to develop this potential may have the effect of regenerating mismanaged croplands and be a cog in the wheel of a decentralized, multi-dimensional renewable energy industry. Efforts to promote and advance these methods became common throughout the European Union through the 2000s. In other areas of the world, inefficient and polluting means to generate heat from biomass coupled with poor forest practices have significantly added to environmental degradation.
Buffer tanks.
Buffer tanks, sometimes referred to as 'thermal stores' are crucial for the efficient operation of all biomass boilers where the system loading fluctuates rapidly, or the volume of water in the complete hydraulic system is relatively small. Using a suitably sized buffer vessel prevents rapid cycling of the boiler when the loading is below the minimum boiler output. Rapid cycling of the boiler causes a large increase in harmful emissions such as Carbon monoxide, dust, and NOx, greatly reduces boiler efficiency and increases electrical consumption of the unit. In addition, service and maintenance requirements will be increased as parts are stressed by rapid heating and cooling cycles. Although most boilers claim to be able to turn down to 30% of nominal output, in the real world this is often not achievable due to differences in the fuel from the 'ideal' or test fuel. A suitably sized buffer tank should therefore be considered where the loading of the boiler drops below 50% of the nominal output – in other words unless the biomass component is purely base load, the system should include a buffer tank. In any case where the secondary system does not contain sufficient water for safe removal of residual heat from the biomass boiler irrespective of the loading conditions, the system must include a suitably sized buffer tank. The residual heat from a biomass unit varies greatly depending on the boiler design and the thermal mass of the combustion chamber. light weight, fast response boilers require only 10ltr/kW, while industrial wet wood units with very high thermal mass require 40ltr/kW
Types of biomass heating systems.
The use of Biomass in heating systems has a use in many different types of buildings, and all have different uses. There are four main types of heating systems that use biomass to heat a boiler. The types are Fully Automated, Semi-Automated, Pellet-Fired, and Combined Heat and Power.
Fully automated.
Fully automated systems operate exactly how they sound. Chipped or ground up waste wood is brought to the site by delivery trucks and dropped into a holding tank. A system of conveyors then transports the wood from the holding tank to the boiler at a certain managed rate. This rate is managed by computer controls and a laser that measures the load of fuel the conveyor is bringing in. The system automatically goes on and off to maintain the pressure and temperature within the boiler. Fully automated systems offer a great deal of ease in their operation because they only require the operator of the system to control the computer, and not the transport of wood.
Semi-automated or "surge bin".
Semi-Automated or "Surge Bin" systems are very similar to fully automated systems except they require more manpower to keep operational. They have smaller holding tanks, and a much simpler conveyor systems which will require personnel to maintain the systems operation. The reasoning for the changes from the fully automated system is the efficiency of the system. Wood fire fueled boilers are most efficient when they are running at their highest capacity, and the heat required most days of the year will not be the peak heat requirement for the year. Considering that the system will only need to run at a high capacity a few days of the year, it is made to meet the requirements for the majority of the year to maintain its high efficiency.
Pellet-fired.
The third main type of biomass heating systems are pellet-fired systems. Pellets are a processed form of wood, which make them more expensive. Although they are more expensive, they are much more condensed and uniform, and therefore are more efficient. In these systems, the pellets are stored in a grain-type storage silo, and gravity is used to move them to the boiler. The storage requirements are much smaller for pellet-fired systems because of their condensed nature, which also helps cut down costs. these systems are used for a wide variety of facilities, but they are most efficient and cost effective for places where space for storage and conveyor systems is limited, and where the pellets are made fairly close to the facility.
Agricultural pellet systems.
Sub category of pellet systems are boilers or burners capable of burning pellet with higher ash rate (paper pellets, hay pellets, straw pellets). One of this kind is PETROJET pellet burner with rotating cylindrical burning chamber.
In terms of efficiencies advanced pellet boilers can exceed other forms of biomass because of the more stable fuel charataristics. Advanced pellet boilers can even work in condensing mode and cool down combustion gases to 30-40°C, instead of 120°C before sent into the flue. 
Combined heat and power.
Combined heat and power systems are very useful systems in which wood waste, such as wood chips, is used to generate power, and heat is created as a byproduct of the power generation system. They have a very high cost because of the high pressure operation. Because of this high pressure operation, the need for a highly trained operator is mandatory, and will raise the cost of operation. Another drawback is that while they produce electricity they will produce heat, and if producing heat is not desirable for certain parts of the year, the addition of a cooling tower is necessary, and will also raise the cost.
There are certain situations where CHP is a good option. Wood product manufacturers would use a combined heat and power system because they have a large supply of waste wood, and a need for both heat and power. Other places where these systems would be optimal are hospitals and prisons, which need energy, and heat for hot water. These systems are sized so that they will produce enough heat to match the average heat load so that no additional heat is needed, and a cooling tower is not needed.

<doc id="9774561" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9774561" title="Wetzlar Cathedral">
Wetzlar Cathedral

Wetzlar Cathedral is a large church in the town of Wetzlar, located on the Lahn river some 50 km north of Frankfurt (Hesse, Germany). Construction began in 1230 and is still unfinished, since the western front is still missing its northern belfry. Because of its long period of construction, the church combines romanesque, gothic and baroque architecture.
The church has never been a bishop's seat, and therefore is not a cathedral in the English sense. The German term for "cathedral", "Dom", often includes churches that lack a "cathedra" (a bishop's throne) and instead refers to any large medieval church. In Wetzlar, the main church has been called a "Dom" since the 17th century.
In 897, Rudolf I, Bishop of Würzburg consecrated a Salvator Church replacing an older church on the same location. In early 10th century it became an Collegiate church devoted to St. Mary. Around 1170 the church was rebuilt into a romanesque basilica with two western spires. Parts of the western portal are still visible in the contemporary building.
After 1230, the cathedral was rebuilt and extended again. Construction lasted until 1490 and remained unfinished. The church became a Hall church with two towers. Construction of the northern spire was started but abandoned long before completion (see image). The southern tower's steep pinnacle was made of wood and was destroyed by a fire in 1561. It was replaced by the baroque tower roof still extant today.
In World War II the cathedral was damaged by bombs. Most of the damage was repairable, but the precious stained glass windows and the organ were lost and had to be replaced by modern equipment.
Wetzlar Cathedral has been used as a simultaneum by both Roman Catholics and Protestants since the 16th century. Today, the church is the main tourist attraction inside the historical city center of Wetzlar.

Joel Tepp

Joel Tepp is a multi-instrumentalist (guitar, harmonica, clarinet) with a 40-year history in live and recorded music. He was born in 1948. He majored in criminology at UC Berkeley, where he was a gymnast, a gold medalist on the pommel horse and a member of the 1968 NCAA national championship team along with Dan Millman ("Way of the Peaceful Warrior"). He then completed another round of studies in music at UCLA.
His performance beginnings were in American Roots music where Tepp learned his trade directly from masters such as Johnny Shines, Bukka White, Earl Hooker, John Lee Hooker, Sippie Wallace, Magic Sam and Shakey Jake Harris. His first instrumental acclaim came on harmonica and clarinet. Working out of Los Angeles, he transitioned to folk, rock and songwriter based music in the mid-1970s, performing or recording with Bonnie Raitt, Iain Matthews, Danny O'Keefe and Spencer Davis Wendy Waldman and others. At this same time, Joel's slide guitar work began to attract attention as well. While certainly facile in traditional blues and rock styles on that instrument, he has gradually developed a signature sound that includes elements of pedal steel and other various unusual harmonics and voicings.
Other activities in the Los Angeles music scene included his stint as the MC at The Troubadour for the legendary Monday night talent showcases. In conjunction with his partner Matt Kramer, the two introduced or previewed many artists who have become mainstays in the music world including Tom Waits, Rikki Lee Jones, Karla Bonoff, Billy Vera and Gail Davies, among many others.
Today, Joel resides in Seattle and is a familiar face as a multi-instrument accompanist at Northwest concerts, in California, Kerrville and elsewhere. He still regularly adds his slide guitar, harmonica and clarinet playing to the music of Bonnie Raitt, Little Feat, Danny O'Keefe, Caroline Aiken and many others. His recording credits include Jerry Garcia, Crazy Horse, John David Souther, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, several major films, television shows and much more. His slide guitar workshops and classes on the Art of Accompaniment are often parts of various music festivals, particularly on the West Coast.
In addition to his work as a musician, Joel Tepp is a financial advisor and father of Rhea Tepp, an experimental artist/musician who performs in the project Magick Orchids and is co-founder of the Los Angeles distro and free form radio station Only For the Open Minded.

Tom Healy (hurler)

Tom or Tommy Healy (born 1855 in Littleton, County Tipperary) was an Irish sportsperson. He played hurling with his local club Thurles Sarsfields and was a member of the very first Tipperary inter-county team in 1887.
Tommy Healy was born in Coolcroo, Littleton, County Tipperary in 1855. He was noted as a fine sportsperson and represented his native Thurles hurling club in the 1880s. In 1887 he won a Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship title with the club, and was consequently picked, with the rest of the team, to represent Tipperary in the inaugural All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. Healy's most notable moment came when he scored the very first goal in an All-Ireland Hurling Final. This happened in the 1887 final, when Tipperary played against Galway. Healy took a pass from team captain Jim Stapleton and made no mistake in sending a low, hard drive to the back of the opposition's net.

Kings Park is a station on the Port Jefferson Branch of the Long Island Rail Road. It is located at the southwest corner of Suffolk CR 14 (Indian Head Road) and NY 25A (Main Street) in Kings Park, New York. This train station is located in the Kings Park Central School District.
History.
Originally known as St. Johnsland station when it was built by the Smithtown and Port Jefferson Railroad between November and December 1872, it was renamed Kings Park station in June 1891. The Kings Park area was the site of a major derailment on February 16, 1947, but there were no casualties. The station was rebuilt in 1948 with an attached freight storage area, and rebuilt again during the 1990s. Kings Park station also had a spur called the Kings Park Psychiatric Center Spur to the former Kings Park Psychiatric Center, which was originally built in 1896, and officially decommissioned in 1971, although trains were used to bring coal to the hospital until 1987. Today the right-of-way serves as the Kings Park Hike and Bike Trail, which leads to the Nissequogue River State Park.
Platforms and tracks.
This station has two high-level side platforms, each 12 cars long. The Port Jefferson Branch has two tracks at this location (main track and siding).

Topo in climbing is a term which refers to the graphical representation (sketch drawing or a photograph with routes depicted) of a climbing route.
It is also used for a climbing guidebook of a crag or climbing area in which most routes are described graphically by such topos.
Individual topo gives the approximate shape of the route, the important rock formations close to the route and details of the grade and protection of each section of the climb. Topo guides usually also include the length of the climbs, where exactly each climb starts, and how to get to the area of the climbs. It will usually specify if a climb is a sport climb (with fixed protection) or a trad climb (traditional, e.g. needing gear to install protection during climb).

Katherine Kelly (actress)

Katherine Kelly (born 19 November 1979) is an English actress, best known for her role in the ITV soap opera "Coronation Street".
After graduating from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 2001, Kelly began her career on stage. Her roles included, Eva in "The Acrington Pals" at the Chichester Festival Theatre and Bianca in "Othello" at the Manchester Royal Exchange. 
In 2006, she began playing Becky McDonald in the soap opera "Coronation Street". She appeared for six years until her departure in 2012. For this role, she won Best Actress at the 2009 British Soap Awards and Best Serial Drama Performance at the 2012 National Television Awards. Her next role was on stage, playing Kate Hardcastle in "She Stoops to Conquer" at the National Theatre.
Her other screen roles include, Lee Middleton in the BBC Four TV film "Best Possible Taste: The Kenny Everett Story" (2012), Lady Mae Loxley in the ITV drama series "Mr Selfridge" (2013-2014), Claire Reid in the ITV miniseries "The Guilty" (2013) and Maloney in the BBC One drama "The Field of Blood" (2013). 
Early life and career.
Kelly was born in Barnsley, South Yorkshire and grew up in both Barnsley and Wakefield, West Yorkshire. She attended Wakefield Girls High School. She has strong links with The Lamproom Theatre in Barnsley, established in 1998 by her father John (who is originally from Castleisland, County Kerry, Ireland), and has regularly supported fund-raising events held there. Kelly said in a 2012 interview: "My parents are still massively involved, and so am I. We even did a Family Fortunes to raise money because we needed a new roof. It's so special to me."
She trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), London, with fellow students Meredith MacNeill and Laurence Fox, graduating in 2001. She worked at Chichester Festival Theatre in "The Accrington Pals" with actress Amy Robbins and at Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester in "Othello" with Andy Serkis and Lorraine Ashbourne. Since then, she has worked in TV, film, radio and voice-over. She was a leading lady at the Royal Shakespeare Company from 2004–2005, performing in both Stratford-Upon-Avon and the West End.
On 18 April 2011 it was announced that she would be leaving "Coronation Street" at her own request by the end of the year. She then starred as Miss Hardcastle in "She Stoops to Conquer" at the National Theatre from 24 January 2012. Kelly appeared on ITV's "This Morning" to discuss her departure from Coronation Street and she said "I decided to leave Coronation Street for a change". She also talked about her role in 'She Stoops To Conquer' and said that "you've got to be careful what you wish for because this couldn't be more different, really!"
Kelly's first television role after leaving "Coronation Street" was in the ninety minute BBC4 biopic "The Best Possible Taste" in which she played Lee Middleton, wife of Kenny Everett. In early 2013 she played socialite Lady Mae in the ten part ITV1 drama series "Mr Selfridge", and later signed on to appear in a second series of the show.
Later in the year she joined the lead cast of "The Field of Blood", based on the novel by Denise Mina. Kelly will play Maloney, an ambitious woman in the "ferociously male-dominated world of 1980s newspaper journalism". In January 2013 it was announced that Kelly would star in "The Last Witch" - a supernatural drama written by BAFTA nominated writer Sally Wainwright, as part of Sky Living's "Reckless" series. In 2013 she will star in an ITV thriller, entitled "The Guilty", as Claire Reid, mother to a missing five year old child.
Music.
In November 2010 it was revealed that Kelly would be appearing on the album, "Coronation Street: Rogues, Angels, Heroes & Fools".
The album, released on 29 November 2010, was specially produced as part of the "Coronation Street" 50th Anniversary celebrations. Kelly, in character as Becky McDonald, sang the lead single from the album, "If It's Too Late" written by Trisha Ward. The single was released exclusively by Tesco on 6 December 2010.
On 20 April 2011, the "Daily Mirror" reported that "If It's Too Late" had been specially remixed by former PWL and Stock Aitken Waterman "Mixmaster", Pete Hammond as a "surprise present" for Kelly after she announced she was leaving "Coronation Street". No release date has been given for the Pete Hammond single, although the "Daily Mirror" stated that it had been released in the US under the name "Angel K".

Jason Galanis

Jason Woodruff Galanis is an American businessman, author and publisher. His investment activity concentrates on venture capital stage opportunities and investments in middle-market companies facing financial distress. He is the owner and publisher of Equities Magazine, a financial publication founded in 1951, and is the author and publisher of a family of branded content-focused websites.
Business.
Galanis is a principal of Holmby Capital Group, a private equity and consulting firm where he is CEO. He has invested in financial technology, patents, trademarks and other intellectual property since 1988. 
He is the principal and CEO of IP Global Investors Ltd. IP Global is an investment company that invests in intellectual property and financial technology businesses. The firm's portfolio investments include the largest beneficial owner of an asset management firm with $1.7 billion of assets under management (as of April 2014).
Small Business Founder.
Galanis co-founded a small business called The Credit Store, Inc., which grew to employ over 350 employees in California and South Dakota. The Credit Store was a consumer advocacy and credit card issuer. Galanis and his partner obtained institutional funding from Cargill and minority owned by Electronic Data Systems (now owned by HP).
Cargill Financial Services provided The Credit Store a $200 million credit facility. Galanis led the refinancing for The Credit Store of the $200 million Cargill credit facility with Morgans Waterfall Vintiadis & Co. Morgans Waterfall was a $2 billion hedge fund that Cargill introduced to The Credit Store.
The Credit Store was a technology and information based financial services company, provides credit card products to consumers who may otherwise fail to qualify for a traditional unsecured bank credit card. The company focused on consumers who have previously defaulted on debt. It reaches these consumers by acquiring their defaulted debt from the lender or subsequent debt owner. Through direct mail and telemarketing operations, these consumers are offered an opportunity to settle their debt, typically at a discount, transfer the agreed settlement amount to a newly issued unsecured MasterCard® or Visa® credit card, and establish a positive credit history on their newly issued card by making timely and consistent payments. The Credit Store accepts lump sum settlements and installment payment plans from those consumers who do not accept the credit card offer, and also resells defaulted debt in the secondary market to other debt buyers.
The origin of the business was Galanis' acquisition of delinquent loans from banks while in college. He developed a proprietary credit-scoring algorithm used to apply a credit ranking and “collectibility” index to non-performing debt. He filed for patents on the technology. To commercialize the patent-pending technology (patents filed by Galanis in 1994), he co-founded Triage Information Systems, a nationwide buyer of consumer debt, with which he closed 31 transactions representing over $2 billion in loans. Triage was an affiliate of The Credit Store.
Galanis and his partner exited The Credit Store in a $152 million transaction in which The Credit Store, together with the trademarks and the patent-pending financial algorithm Galanis invented, was sold to an investment group financed by GE Capital and Chaired by the former President of HSBC USA. The transaction was advised by Wasserstein Perella.
After the sale of The Credit Store in October 1996, Galanis temporarily retired and moved to London, England.
Credit Card Issuer Buy-Out.
Galanis had led the acquisition of 100% of another established credit card company called Service One International of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in a leveraged buyout. Service One was a full service consumer credit provider that specialized exclusively in the issuance of VISA and MasterCard branded credit cards to consumers. Service One is regarded as the pioneers in credit card products to credit-impaired Americans and at one time was the largest issuer of credit cards in the United States to this demographic.
Online Credit Card Billing Technology Company.
Galanis arranged and financed the acquisition of a third credit card company called Internet Billing Company in 2004 (iBill).
In 2004, Galanis organized the leveraged buy-out of Internet Billing Company (iBill) from a NASDAQ listed company as a-carve-out of a division of a public company. iBill was the largest credit card processor in the United States of online transactions. iBill focused on processing transactions for online subscriptions and memberships, which consisted predominately access to adult themed content. iBill created and maintained the most extensive database in the nation on consumer transactions for adult content with over 29 million unique records.
iBill had been acquired by a public company in 2002 for $112 million in cash. The public company came under criticism for the ownership of a credit card processor that primarily served adult transactions and determined to dispose of the subsidiary. The Galanis lead group acquired the company in 2004 for $34 million.
The business plan included the combination of iBill and Penthouse where the iBill database and the iBill proprietary financial technology was to be combined with the Penthouse intellectual property and adult industry expertise. The combination of the iBill database and financial technology with the registered trademarks of Penthouse was intended to create a fully integrated ‘new media’ company on the Internet.
The iBill/Penthouse combination plan was part of the efforts of Penthouse to emerge from bankruptcy protection filed in 2003. The extended contentious Penthouse bankruptcy reorganization and litigation adversely affected iBill’s business.
The company was resold to an American Stock Exchange listed public company for $54 million a year after acquisition.
Trademark Investments.
Galanis is known for providing reorganization financing to Robert Guccione’s General Media, the owner of the PENTHOUSE trademarks and publisher of Penthouse Magazine. He provided financing prior to the bankruptcy reorganization and as part of the bankruptcy exit plan. The permanent financing was led by Post Advisory Group, a Principal Financial Group (NYSE: PFG) subsidiary that manages approximately $9 billion in various credit strategies. Galanis introduced Post Advisory to Penthouse and worked with Post tot structure the senior debt facility.
In 2002, Galanis identified an opportunity to acquire certain Internet licensing rights to registered trademarks owned by Penthouse, the company founded by Robert Guccione in 1965. Galanis and Guccione reached agreement to acquire the rights to the Penthouse brand for use on the Internet and Galanis agreed to finance Guccione’s magazine publishing business. Galanis paid Guccione an upfront fee of $1.0 million for the Internet rights.
In October 2002, a public company of which Galanis beneficially owned 73%, acquired 99.5% of General Media, the parent company of Penthouse. Galanis was the first outside equity shareholder of Penthouse since its founding in the 1960s, and he continued to invest in Penthouse through 2003, when Guccione ordered the company placed into voluntary bankruptcy protection.
Galanis then led the investment group that committed $68 million to the bankruptcy Plan of Reorganization to restructure General Media through chapter 11. Galanis and his financial partner from Mexico City led the refinancing group, which was participated by Post Advisory Group.
Penthouse Media Group, now known as FriendFinder Networks, is one of the largest social media companies in the world with 38,000 websites, more than 445 million registrants and more than 298 million members in more than 200 countries and $345 million in revenues in 2010. It was previously controlled by financier and technology entrepreneur, Marc Bell.
Real Estate Investments.
Galanis also completed the 2004 acquisition of the 22,000-square-foot (2,000 m2) Guccione Mansion in New York City, one of the largest residences in Manhattan.
Guccione had been unsuccessfully seeking financing for the home for eight years. The property was in the process of being foreclosed on by his mortgage holders. Galanis created, negotiated and closed a financing structure that resulted the acquisition of the property for $26.5 million from the lenders. Galanis funded the equity and placed the new mortgage. 
In March 2008, hedge fund manager Phil Falcone, founder of Harbinger Capital, acquired the Guccione Mansion for $49 million.

Thud Ridge

Thud Ridge is a 1969 memoir by Jack Broughton about flying the F-105 "Thud" for the United States Air Force in the Vietnam War during Operation Rolling Thunder. The title "Thud Ridge" derives from the nickname given by F-105 pilots to the Tam Dao range (), which was both a waypoint during air attacks in the vicinity of Hanoi, North Vietnam, and a terrain masking feature for ingressing fighters.
The book set a style that was followed over the next several decades by a spate of gritty memoirs by air veterans of the Vietnam War. Broughton's book is unique to the extent that it was described as "history in the making" by Hanson W. Baldwin of the "New York Times".
Inspiration and publication.
The book is based on Broughton's tour of duty between September 1966 and June 1967 as Vice Commander of the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing, based at Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. The narrative is anecdotal in nature, a commentary of his observations of persons, aircraft, and events during his tour, more or less chronologically, but without dated references. Few individuals are identified by other than first or nicknames, but Broughton develops most as characters through descriptions of their career backgrounds. Broughton's accounts of missions "up north" were enhanced in both accuracy and verisimilitude by verbatim transcriptions of radio transmissions he recorded using a small tape recorder mounted in the cockpit of his aircraft.
In "Thud Ridge" Broughton is highly critical of the U.S. command structure directing air operations against North Vietnam. He blames micromanagement by the highest levels in Washington down to the Thirteenth Air Force, a command echelon based in the Philippines, for losses of men and aircraft that he characterizes as "astronomical" and "worthless". He is particularly critical, however, of the "bomber mentality" management by generals who came up through the Strategic Air Command and then occupied key command slots in the war, which was being fought by pilots of the Tactical Air Command.
The book came about when, at the completion of his tour of duty, Broughton and two of his pilots were court martialed by the USAF for allegedly conspiring to violate the rules of engagement regarding U.S. air operations. Although acquitted of the most serious charges, Broughton, who had been personally relieved of duty by Pacific Air Forces commander Gen. John D. Ryan, was subsequently transferred to an obscure post in the Pentagon, allegedly as a vendetta because his punishment was so slight. Required by office protocol to work only two or three days a month, he used both his extra time and his bitterness at the Air Force to compose "Thud Ridge" while he awaited approval of an application to appeal of his conviction to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records.
After his conviction was overturned and expunged from his record because of "undue command influence", Broughton retired from the Air Force in August 1968 and had the memoir published by J. B. Lippincott. The book appeared soon after as a Bantam paperback, with reprint editions in 1985, 2002, and 2006.
Legacy.
Broughton's book brought him into immediate disfavor with the Air Force hierarchy. However, thirty years after the incident resulting in the court martial, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General Ronald R. Fogleman added "Thud Ridge" to the CSAF Professional Reading Program he instituted in 1996 and directed the Air Force to purchase 10,000 copies. Along with 12 other books on the reading list, "Thud Ridge" was provided at no expense to all Air Force officers upon their promotion to captain.

Topo (robot)

Topo is a robot designed in the 1980s by Androbot Inc., for the consumer and education markets. It was programmable via Apple II and there was also a user made program for the Windows 9x operating systems. The programming language allows the robot to perform a set of geometric movements, to move about a room and perform tasks. It was like a servant robot, although it did not truly meet the requirements of a robot, as it had no sensors to use to receive input and then make decisions accordingly.
The robots were sold commercially starting in early 1983, and were intended to be inexpensive, lacking a complicated manipulating device. Units were beige molded plastic with two drive wheels as "feet" and stood about 36" tall. Arms on Topo 1 and 2 would fold out, but Topo 3 lacked arms all together. Operation was based on one of two programming languages, either Apple BASIC, a modified version of the Logo language, or a version of Forth.
Communication was via a radio or infrared transmitter attached to a personal computer. Topo 2 and 3 used an infrared transmitter, and could be controlled by a four way pad on the top of their head that also served as the infrared receiver.
In its final versions, Topo abilities included a text-to-speech processor, so that users could program their robots to wander around the house and "speak" to humans. However, a fourth model was made but it never went into production (a Topo IV sheet was mailed during the final days of Androbot). It was more like the B.O.B. (Brains On Board, an unreleased robot that was produced after the Topo series) robot than a Topo.

Elise Ottesen-Jensen

Elise Ottesen-Jensen, also known as Ottar, (2 January 1886 − 4 September 1973) was a Norwegian-Swedish sex educator, journalist and anarchist agitator, whose main mission was to fight for women's rights to understand and control their own body and sexuality. She was a member of the Swedish anarcho-syndicalist union Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden. Her followers consider her a pioneer in the field of women's rights and feminism.
Her personal motto was ""I dream of the day when every new born child is welcome, when men and women are equal, and when sexuality is an expression of intimacy, joy and tenderness.""
Life and career.
A vicar's daughter, Ottar was born as "Elise Ottesen", the 17th of 18 children, in the municipality of Høyland (incorporated into Sandnes in 1965) in Rogaland county, Norway. Later in life, her father sent away her little sister Magnhild to give birth in Denmark, so that she could be forced to give up her child. Maghild was told nothing about pregnancy or birth, and for nine months she feared that her stomach would just split. She committed suicide because of the longing for the child she had to leave behind. For this, Ottar could never forgive her father, and the fate of her sister became a strong driving force for her commitment to the struggle for women's rights.
Ottar's dream was to become a dentist, but an explosion in the chemistry laboratory of her high school injured her fingers, spoiling her chances to pursue a dentist career. Instead she started to work in a newspaper, and eventually became a journalist. She had always questioned the preachings of her father, and early arrived at the conclusion that she was not a christian. She now found that her sympathies were with the socialists, and it was with them she would struggle for the rest of her life.
She made several attempts to organize working class women. But soon they started asking her for advice in sexual matters, asking her questions like "Do I always have to when my husband wants to?", "What can I do to avoid getting pregnant?".
By the end of the First World War, Ottar met and developed a close friendship with the Swedish anarcho-syndicalist peace agitator Albert Jensen. They later married, and Elise Ottesen changed her surname to Ottesen-Jensen. When Albert Jensen was expelled from Norway, she came with him to Denmark. There, she gave birth to their child, who died soon after birth.
Ottar and Albert moved to Sweden, and she came to know a doctor who amongst other things taught her how to use a diaphragm. She then set out for her first nation-wide tour, in Sweden. She travelled from Skåne to Norrland, teaching female workers how to avoid pregnancy. She agitated for the right for women to experience sexual pleasure, for free abortion, for the repealing of the laws against contraceptives, for gay rights, and more. What she did was illegal and she risked harsh penalties.
In the 1920s, Ottar was a regular writer for Arbetaren, with her own column focusing on feminist issues. After a disagreements with the other editors of Arbetaren in 1925, she started her own paper, "Vi kvinnor". The paper did however not last for long. A few years later, she also wrote for the anarchist magazine Brand.
In 1933, Ottar, together with a number of radical medical doctors and trade union representatives, founded the Swedish Association for Sexuality Education (, RFSU). She became its first President, and held this post until 1956. Ottesen-Jensen was also one of the founders of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), in 1953. A paper published by RFSU bears the name "Ottar", to honour Elise Ottesen-Jensen. This paper changed its name to "Ottar" in 2001, and was earlier known as "RFSU bulletin".

Los Alfaques disaster

The Los Alfaques disaster was a road accident and tanker explosion which occurred on 11 July 1978 in Alcanar, near Tarragona, in Spain. The tanker truck was loaded with 23 tons of highly flammable liquefied propylene. 217 people (including the driver) were killed and 200 more severely burned.
The campsite is located at km 159 on the N-340 national road, 2 km south of the town of Sant Carles de la Ràpita. It has been renovated since and still exists today.
Circumstances.
The truck, consisting of a Pegaso tractor unit registered M-7034-C and a Fruehauf semi-trailer tanker registered M-7981-R, was owned by Cisternas Reunidas S.A. At 10:15 that day, the truck, driven by 50-year old Francisco Imbernón Villena, arrived at the state-owned ENPETROL refinery, located at La Pobla de Mafumet, 9 km North of Tarragona, to be loaded with propylene for another state-owned company, Paular (now REPSOL), from Puertollano.
At 12:05 the truck left the refinery carrying 23 tons of propylene, nearly 4 tons over the maximum design load of 19.35 tons. The tanker drivers were under instructions to take the smaller N-340 national road instead of the larger A-7 motorway when carrying cargo to Barcelona, in order to avoid the motorway toll. The N-340 was much narrower and more winding than the A-7, and also carried drivers directly through several densely populated areas.
On a summer day with temperatures from 20–35 °C, the pressure in the tank would have been .
Accident.
The disaster occurred at ca. 14:35, while the truck was moving past the Los Alfaques campsite after having travelled 102 km.
There are several different witness reports as to the events directly preceding the blast, all of which are more or less equally plausible. Some reported the tank was already leaking as it approached the site, or sprung a leak with a loud bang while passing the site, and was then stopped by the driver. Others reported the bang being caused by a blown tire which caused the truck to swerve out of control and strike the wall separating the campsite from the roadside, possibly overturning in the process.
In either case, the leaking tanker formed a cloud of gaseous propylene that partially entered the campsite and also drifted on the wind towards the discothèque to the northeast. The white cloud attracted the attention of campsite patrons, who approached the cloud with curiosity as it continued to spread. As the cloud began to permeate the crowded discothèque, it reached an ignition source and immediately flashed back into the tanker, causing a fire that nearly instantaneously ruptured the weakened tank and ignited the full load of gas.
At that time the campsite to the south was crowded with nearly 1000 vacationers, mostly German and other foreign tourists, packed tightly in trailers and tents. The blast and fireball (which was estimated at over 1000 °C and left a 65'x5' x 1.5 meters crater) destroyed everything – cars, trailers and buildings – within a 300-metre radius, gutting over 90% of the main camping area. The discothèque to the northeast, which contained almost 100 people and was later determined to be the likely source of the ignition, was also razed, killing all inside.
Victims and emergency response.
The explosion and fireball instantly killed the driver and other people within the area. A total of 157 people died on site as a result of the initial explosion and the subsequent fires and explosions of cars and gas cylinders used by the tourists. Victims were seen with their hair and clothing aflame running into the sea in an attempt to extinguish the flames.
In the first 45 minutes after the disaster, the wounded were removed in an uncoordinated fashion with the help of other survivors using their own cars and vans. Locals also provided help and took the wounded to the hospitals. Ambulances and other emergency forces gradually arrived. The Civil Guard and the armed forces searched the devastated camp for survivors. It took 3 hours until the last wounded was removed and taken to hospital.
The burning tanker blocked the road, dividing the injured into two groups, one being taken northwards and the other southwards. On the road to the north, the injured received adequate medical care, once they had reached either the hospitals at Amposta or at Tortosa. At this stage, the final destination of 58 severely burned patients was the Francisco Franco Hospital in Barcelona. 82 severely burned patients were taken south to the La Fe Hospital in Valencia. In most cases no medical steps of any importance were taken during the journey. Several of the injured developed severe shock on the journey and had no measurable blood pressure on arrival. Many of the patients had burns covering more than 90% of their bodies, and most of them died during the following days. Contributing to the high mortality figure was the inappropriate medical care given en route to the hospital.
In the week following the disaster, the patients from France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands were evacuated to their own countries.
300 people were wounded, some of them severely. 217 people died as a result of the disaster, while the total number of people who died over the following months as a result of their injuries was at least 270. Among them, four were Spaniards, and all the others were foreigners. The official figure for the number of victims is 215.
Many of the victims were burned beyond recognition. Most of them were wearing only swimming suits, and the building where their documents were stored was destroyed in the explosion. There was no DNA test available at that time. As a result of the work done by the forensic teams from the tourists' home countries, all the victims were eventually identified.
Seven of the victims remained unidentified until some time later, and they were interred at the cemetery of Tortosa (Tarragona). The bodies of a French family, consisting of a couple and their two children, were returned to France some years later, after compensation had been settled. The bodies of another family of three originating from Colombia were never sent home, and they remain the only foreigners to be interred at the cemetery of Tortosa along with local victims.
Inquiry.
Following the accident, Cisternas Reunidas accepted responsibility for the disaster, but denied any order or prohibition to the drivers to use the motorway instead of the national road, claiming that it is the driver who chooses which road to take. Later, some workers at the Tarragona plant stated they heard Imbernón heatedly arguing with someone on the phone and demanding money for the motorway toll.
Enpetrol initially declined any responsibility, claiming that the delivery of the cargo is on the carrier's responsibility, and they have not received any complaint.
The official inquiry identified that the truck had been severely overloaded, and also lacked emergency pressure release valves, which are designed to help prevent a BLEVE in case of a fire. However, these valves were no longer mandatory in 1978, although they previously were. The truck was due for an inspection check-over in 1980, and it had passed the previous inspection.
The tank container was manufactured at 13 December 1973 by a workshop from Bilbao, and at that time it did not meet the requirements for carrying flammable liquids, since it lacked emergency pressure release valves. Therefore, the tank had been used to carry other substances, some of which were highly corrosive. Tests on the remnants of the steel tank revealed microscopic stress cracks consistent with corrosion caused by previous loads of improperly overpressurized anhydrous ammonia. Combined with whether the tanker suffered an impact that caused additional structural damage, these factors likely led to the almost instantaneous rupture of the tank when the flames flashed back into the tanker. Even without safety valves, a structurally sound and properly filled tanker should have been able to maintain structural integrity in a fire long enough to at least allow nearby people to escape.
The inquiry also revealed that overloading of tankers was common practice at ENPETROL refineries. The Tarragona facility lacked either a meter to measure the amount of gas dispensed or an automatic shut-off device to prevent overfilling, and consequently most tanks were consistently overloaded. The driver was neither informed of the overloading, nor about the type and class of the cargo, and there was no means for him to check the pressure level of the tank before he departed or to monitor it in transit. He had not attended the HAZMAT training program for drivers of dangerous goods, because the company considered his experience of 20 years as a truck driver to be sufficient. The inquiry also determined that, between 3 January and 7 July that year, 32 tanks left the Tarragona refinery overloaded, with drivers other than Imbernón.
Aftermath.
After the tragedy, the transit of populated areas by vehicles carrying dangerous cargo was prohibited in Spain, and would only be driven at night.
In 1982, four employees of ENPETROL and two of Cisternas Reunidas were convicted of criminal negligence, and were sentenced to prison for between one and four years. Later, four of them were released after appealing the Court's decision, and all prison sentences were suspended or reduced. The two companies paid an equivalent of €13.23 million (not allowing for inflation) as compensation to the victims.
In popular culture.
The accident is featured in the 2007 German film Day of Disaster, directed by Peter Keglevic. However, the film is loosely based on real facts, and contains blunders and factual errors, such as cars or registration plates which could only have appeared years later, or the driver spending the night before at home with the already (over)loaded tanker parked in front of his house.
Los Alfaques today.
It took six months after the tragedy, until the campsite was completely renovated and reopened to tourists.
The owners of the Los Alfaques campsite have sought relief through Spanish courts under the newly approved "Right to Be Forgotten" Act passed by Spain in regard to having the disaster land as the top 12 search results on Google, including thumbnail images of remains and coroner procedures during cleanup of the campground. The trial was dismissed, informing the plaintiffs that they would need to pursue a U.S. lawsuit against Google.

Los Topos

Los Topos was a subversive, community theater group in California during the 1970s. They named themselves after the Spanish word for "mole" (topo), referring to their undergroup activities. One member of this group even adopted Topo as his stage name. He later specialised in 'robotics' miming mechanical robots. Together with Jimini Hignett he formed his own fringe company 'Christians from Outer Space' performing satirical theatre together, and on July 29, 1981 (the same day as Prince Charles and Lady Diana) they were married - he dressed as Diana, Jimini as Charles. At the wedding - dubbed ‘The Royal Drag’ by the "Soho News" - all guests are also cross-dressed (the Queen Mum sporting an enormous hairy back and a hat made from pizza boxes). The preacher at first refuses to conduct the ceremony, thinking they were both men. The event is shown on the Channel 7 TV-news.

Veronica Hardstaff

Veronica Mary Hardstaff (born Veronica Mary Tutt, 23 October 1941) is a British politician, who has served as a City councillor in Sheffield and in the European Parliament. A member of the Labour Party, she is on the left of the party.
Education and career.
Hardstaff went to the University of Manchester where she obtained a degree in German, and then studied at the University of Cologne. She married in 1964 and had a son and daughter, but divorced in 1977, retaining her married name. Hardstaff worked as a teacher of German and French, first at High Storrs Girls' Grammar School in Sheffield, then at St Peter's Secondary Modern School. 
In 1971 she was elected as a Labour Party candidate to Sheffield City Council in Walkley ward, becoming a full-time councillor; she served for seven years. In 1977 she went back to work at Knottingley High School, moving in 1979 to the Frecheville School in Sheffield, and from 1986 to the Birley School.
1994 European election.
At the 1994 European Parliament election, Hardstaff was the Labour Party candidate in Lincolnshire and Humberside South. This constituency was made up of seven constituencies for the United Kingdom Parliament, of which six were held by the Conservative Party. The Labour Party considered winning this election would be taking "a prize Tory scalp". In the end, Hardstaff was elected as Member of the European Parliament with a majority of 13,745.
European Parliament.
She was chosen by her colleagues as Chairwoman of the European Parliamentary Labour Party. In January 1995, she abstained from signing a declaration against a change in Clause IV of the Labour Party constitution, despite 36 Labour MEPs doing so. With an agricultural constituency she took up farming issues, calling for a new approach to food quality after the BSE scandal including stricter regulation of intensive farming. When Lincolnshire was described as a prosperous area, she wrote to object based on the low wages paid to some farmworkers. She was also Vice-Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee between the European Parliament and Poland from 1995.
For the 1999 European Parliament election, the electoral system was changed to list-based proportional representation. Hardstaff was placed at sixth out of seven on the regional list for Yorkshire and the Humber, a place which made it practically impossible for her to be re-elected; this low placing was attributed to her alliance with the left. In the election, Labour won only three seats in the region.
Sheffield City council.
In 2002, Hardstaff was elected to Sheffield City Council for a second term, from Walkley ward. In May 2005 she was appointed to the cabinet of Sheffield as member for Children's Services, responsible both for education and for social services to children. She supported plans to bring in a City Academy to replace an existing secondary school, sponsored by a Christian educational charity; she also defended the use of the Private Finance Initiative as a pragmatic way of supporting investment. She left the Sheffield cabinet in May 2006 and in May 2007 was defeated in her re-election bid in Walkley. She stood again in Walkley ward in 2008, but was defeated. At the same election Hardstaff's brother, Chris Tutt, was re-elected to Sheffield City Council, in Mosborough ward, for the Liberal Democrats.

American Piano Company

American Piano Company (abbr. Ampico) was an American piano manufacturer located in East Rochester, New York, which was known from the beginning for the production of high quality player pianos. The company was established in 1908 under the aegis of Wm. Knabe & Co. of Baltimore as a merger between Chickering & Sons of Boston, Haines Brothers, Marshall & Wendell, and Foster, Armstrong & Company, all of Rochester, New York.
From 1913 Ampico was one of the leading producers of reproducing pianos, the others being Duo-Art (1913) and Welte-Mignon (1905). The player piano and reproducing mechanism was designed by Charles Fuller Stoddard (1876–1958). A great number of distinguished classical and popular pianists, such as Sergei Rachmaninoff, Leo Ornstein, Winifred MacBride, and Marguerite Volavy (1886–19??), recorded for Ampico, and their rolls are a legacy of 19th and early 20th century aesthetic and musical practice. By 1929 Ampico was in essential economic difficulties and was finally taken over by the Aeolian Company.
Despite the Ampico's decline, the company did not officially close until 1941, which exceeded past the Great Depression. The last model introduced was the Ampico Spinet Reproducing Piano, which had all the functionality of a reproducing piano, and although having a low cost of $495, still failed in sales.
Rythmodik Music Corporation.
In May 1918, The Music Roll Division of the American Piano Company became a separate company and henceforth was named Rythmodik Music Corporation, based in Belleville, New Jersey.

Mike Reynolds (architect)

Michael E. "Mike" Reynolds is an American architect based in New Mexico known for the design and construction of Earthships. He is a proponent of "radically sustainable living". He has been a critic of the profession of architecture for its failure to deal with the amount of waste that building design creates.
Career.
After graduating from the University of Cincinnati in 1969, Reynolds immediately began producing his provocative work. His thesis was published in "Architectural Record" in 1971 and the following year he built his first house from recycled materials. The structures built under his direction utilize everyday trash items like aluminum cans, plastic bottles and used tires. Instead of using conventional (and energy-consuming) recycling methods, however, Reynolds takes the discarded item and recycles them as-is. His "Thumb House", built in 1972, used beer cans wired together into "bricks," which were mortared together and then plastered over. The brick design was patented in 1973.
Reynolds calls this practice "Earthship Biotecture". He cites as an epiphany the moment he realized that any object, be it a pop bottle or an old tire, could become powerful and durable insulation when it was filled with dirt. He has written five books on the subject.
Soon he was building and selling his experimental homes while continuing to use trial and error to improve them.
Over time, the Earthships incorporated features designed to make them comfortable to live in while existing off the grid. Solar panels and geothermal cooling were added. The unusual homes caught the attention of celebrities and environmental activists. Actors Dennis Weaver and Keith Carradine each commissioned Reynolds to build high-end Earthships for them.
Though Reynolds always stressed the experimental nature of his homes, disillusioned buyers filed lawsuits and complaints over defects such as leaky roofs and inadequate climate control. Spurred by the many claims against Reynolds, the State Architects Board of New Mexico stripped him of his credentials, saying his home designs were illegal and unsafe. In 1990, Reynolds gave up his New Mexico architecture and construction licenses after a year-long dispute with several clients. 
With the rise in concern over global warming, Reynolds has been elevated as a prophet of the green movement. A 2007 documentary, "Garbage Warrior", glorifies his life and work. In the film, Reynolds is quoted as saying he fell into depression after his licensing troubles. Faced with the end of his career, Reynolds agreed to follow state and federal codes, though not without protest. Relationships with his former clients whose earthships failed were never repaired, though the state's intervention left some satisfied that at least others would not be affected in the same ways they had. Reynolds' architect's license was reinstated in 2007 after a 17 year battle, and he resumed building Earthships. Since then, the American Institute of Architects has asked Reynolds to give a lecture at its headquarters in Colorado. 
In "Garbage Warrior", Reynolds describes one of his new homes, called the "Phoenix": "There's nothing coming into this house, no power lines, no gas lines, no sewage lines coming out, no water lines coming in, no energy being used ... We're sitting on 6,000 gallons of water, growing food, sewage internalized, 70 degrees 21 degrees C year-round ... What these kind of houses are doing is taking every aspect of your life and putting it into your own hands ... A family of four could totally survive here without having to go to the store."
Reynolds features in episode 5 of the 2008 documentary 'Stephen Fry in America'. Reynolds gives Fry a guided tour of his house, describing the various features and their functions.
Reynolds claims that his buildings can operate off the electricity grid, requiring little or no mortgage payment and no utility bills.
