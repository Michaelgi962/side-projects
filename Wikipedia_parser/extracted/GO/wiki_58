Grote Chair of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic

The Grote Chair of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic is an endowed chair at University College London.
Origin.
Along with Moral Philosophy, Philosophy of Mind and Logic (originally called Logic and the Philosophy of the Human Mind) was one of two Philosophy chairs established at the founding of University College London. The first Mind and Logic professorship was awarded to John Hoppus, a Congregational minister, who held the position from 1830 to 1866. George Grote, one of the College's founders and a member of its governing Council, objected to the appointment on the grounds that the College was intended to be non-sectarian and that therefore a Philosophy chair should not be held by a minister of religion. Because of this incident, Grote resigned from the Council in 1830. In 1866 Grote, who had returned to the Council in 1849, was instrumental in preventing the awarding of the Chair to James Martineau, a Unitarian minister, for the same reasons. Grote's preferred candidate, George Croom Robertson, was appointed to the Chair in 1867.
Grote's will provided an endowment of £6000 for the Chair of Philosophy of Mind and Logic, with the stipulation that the income could not be awarded to a holder of the Chair who was a minister of any religion. Instead, the income was to be held back and reinvested until a lay person was again appointed. Grote died in 1871 and in 1876, two years before her own death, his widow Harriet Grote passed on the £6000 to the College.

Donald Bell

Donald Bell (born 19 June 1934) is a Canadian bass-baritone and vocal pedagogue. For over four decades he actively performed in concerts and operas internationally. He retired from performance in 1994. As a vocal pedagogue he has researched and published studies on vocal acoustics and laryngeal function. He is the founder of the Vocal Arts Acoustical Research Group at the University of Calgary where he currently serves on the voice faculty.
Life and career.
Born in South Burnaby, British Columbia, Bell graduated from South Burnaby High School in 1952. He began his voice studies in his youth with conductor and educator Nancy Paisley Benn. While studying with Benn he made his professional debut in 1948 at the age of 14 as a soloist with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. He was then active as a recitalist and singer on CBC Radio while a highschool student. After highschool, he continued to perform and study with Benn while working for a Vancouver plywood mill for one year.
In 1953 Bell entered the Royal College of Music in London on a scholarship. Upon earning his artist dilploma from the RCM in 1955 he was awarded the Harriet Cohen Award and Arnold Bax Memorial Medal. He then continued his studied in Berlin with Hermann Weissenborn from 1955 to 1957. He later studied singing with Judith Boroschek in Düsseldorf from 1967 to 1976, and with Richard Miller at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music from 1985 to 1990.
Bell made his professional opera debut at the Glyndebourne Festival Opera in 1955, which was followed by performances later that year at the Berlin State Opera. From 1958 to 1961 he was heard annually at the Bayreuth Festival as the Night Watchman in Richard Wagner's "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg". He appeared at the Berlin Festival in 1958 in Boris Blacher's "Abstrakte Oper". In 1961 he portrayed Ford in Giuseppe Verdi's "Falstaff" in a CBC Television production starring Louis Quilico in the title role.
During the late 1950s and early 1960s Bell was frequently heard as a soloist in choral-orchestral works with major symphony orchestras. In 1958 he appeared with the Berlin Philharmonic in Johann Sebastian Bach's "St Matthew Passion". In 1959 he was a soloist in two different presentations of George Frideric Handel's "Messiah": one in Lucerne with conductor Thomas Beecham and the other in Berlin under the baton of Malcolm Sargent. That same year he performed as a soloist with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy in concerts of Bach's "Christmas Oratorio" at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia and at Carnegie Hall in New York City. He made his first appearance with the New York Philharmonic singing in the inaugural concert of Lincoln Center's Philharmonic Hall (now Avery Fisher Hall) on 28 September 1962 with Leonard Bernstein conducting.
In 1961 Bell toured Israel and in 1963 he toured the USSR. He moved to Düsseldorf in 1964 where he worked for the next three years as a resident artist at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein. At that opera house he sang such roles as Amfortas in "Parsifal", Count Almaviva in "The Marriage of Figaro", Kurwenal in "Tristan und Isolde", Méphistophélès in "Faust", Wolfram in "Tannhäuser", and the title role in "Don Giovanni" among others. In 1973 he performed the role of Alfred in the British premiere of Gottfried von Einem's "Der Besuch der alten Dame" at the Glyndebourne Festival. The following year he sang the part of Catiline in the premiere of Iain Hamilton's "The Catiline Conspiracy" at the Scottish Opera.
Bell retired from performance in 1994. He joined the faculty of voice at music department of the University of Calgary in 1982. He became a full professor at that institution in 1991.

Jan Gulbrandsen

Jan Gulbrandsen (29 May 1938 – 4 September 2007) was a Norwegian hurdler, politician and sports official.
His main event was the 400 metres hurdles. He became Norwegian champion in the event from 1957 through 1964, and won a silver medal in 1965. He held the Norwegian record between 1958 and 1960, with 51.5 as the best time, achieved in 1964. His best electronic time was 52.40 seconds. He competed in 400 metres hurdles at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, but was knocked out in the semi-final. At both the 1958 and 1962 European Championships he was knocked out in the heats.
In the 110 metres hurdles he became Norwegian champion in 1960, 1961 and 1962 before the rivals Weum/Fimland started their more-than-decade-long dominance. Gulbrandsen also won national silver medals in 110 metres hurdles in 1957, 1958, 1959, 1963 and 1964. His personal best time was 14.5 seconds, achieved in 1962. In the sprint/running distances he had 22.5 in the 200 metres (1959), 49.1 in the 400 metres (1958) and 1:51.9 in the 800 metres (1960). He also had 6.81 metres in the long jump (1958) and 14.29 in the triple jump (1956). With these diverse abilities he also became Norwegian pentathlon and decathlon champion in 1959. He scored his personal bests the same year; 3.556 points and 6.551 points respectively. He held Norwegian records in both events until 1962, when both were overtaken by Hans B. Skaset. Gulbrandsen also had a record in the 4 x 400 metres relay with the national team. From 1960 to 1965 he was a national team coach. He represented the club SK Vidar.
He was a department director at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences from 1968 to 1973. From 1974 to 1975 he was a State Secretary in the Ministry of the Environment as a part of Labour's Bratteli Cabinet. He was later director of park and sports in Oslo Municipality from 1977 to 1984, and from 1985 to 1989 he was the managing director of the Norwegian Automobile Federation and president of the Norwegian Olympic Committee.

Effects of stress on memory

The effects of stress on memory include interference with a person's capacity to encode memory and the ability to retrieve information. During times of stress, the body reacts by secreting stress hormones into the bloodstream. Stress can cause acute and chronic changes in certain brain areas which can cause long-term damages. Over-secretion of stress hormones most frequently affects memory negatively, but in a few cases can affect it positively. In particular, the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and the amygdala are affected. One class of stress hormone responsible for negatively affecting memory is the glucocorticoids (GCs), the most notable of which is cortisol. Glucocorticoids facilitate and impair the actions of stress in the brain memory process. Cortisol is a known biomarker for stress. Under normal circumstances, the hippocampus regulates the production of cortisol through negative feedback because it has many receptors that are sensitive to these stress hormones. However, an excess of cortisol can impair the ability of the hippocampus to both encode and recall memories. These stress hormones are also hindering the hippocampus from receiving enough energy by diverting glucose levels to surrounding muscles.
Stress affects many memory functions and cognitive functioning of the brain. There are different levels of stress and the high levels can be intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic stress level is triggered by a cognitive challenge whereas extrinsic can be triggered by a condition not related to a cognitive task. Intrinsic stress can be acutely and chronically experienced by a person. The varying effects of stress on performance or stress hormones are often compared to or known as “inverted-u” which induce areas in learning, memory and plasticity. Chronic stress can affect the brain structure and cognition.
Studies considered the effects of stress on both intrinsic and extrinsic memory functions, using for both of them Pavlovian conditioning and spatial learning. In regard to intrinsic memory functions, the study evaluated how stress affected memory functions that was triggered by a learning challenge. In regard to extrinsic stress, the study focused on stress that was not related to cognitive task but was elicited by other situations. The results determined that intrinsic stress was facilitated by memory consolidation process and extrinsic stress was determined to be heterogeneous in regard to memory consolidation. Researchers found that high stress conditions were a good representative of the impact that extrinsic stress can cause on memory functioning. It was also proven that extrinsic stress does have an impact on spatial learning whereas acute extrinsic stress does not.
Physiology.
When a stressful situation is encountered, stress hormones are released into the blood stream. Adrenaline is released by the adrenal glands to begin the response in the body. Adrenaline acts as a catalyst for the fight-or-flight response, which is a response of the sympathetic nervous system to encourage the body to react to the apparent stressor. This response causes an increase in heart-rate, blood pressure, and accelerated breathing. The kidneys release glucose, providing energy to combat or flee the stressor. Blood is redirected to the brain and major muscle groups, diverted away from energy consuming bodily functions unrelated to survival at the present time. There are three important axes, the adrenocorticotropic axis, the vasopressin axis and the thyroxine axis, which are responsible for the physiologic response to stress.
Adrenocorticotropic hormone axis.
When a receptor within the body senses a stressor, a signal is sent to the anterior hypothalamus. At the reception of the signal, corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) acts on the anterior pituitary. The anterior pituitary in turn releases adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH induces the release of corticosteriods and aldosterone from the adrenal gland. These substances are the main factors responsible for the stress response in humans. Cortisol for example stimulates the mobilization of free fatty acids and proteins and the breakdown of amino acids, and increases serum glucos level and blood pressure, among other effects. On the other hand, aldosterone is responsible for water retention associated with stress. As a result of cells retaining sodium and eliminating potassium, water is retained and blood pressure is increased by increasing the blood volume.
Vasopressin axis.
A second physiological response in relation to stress occurs via the vasopressin axis. Vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), is synthesized["where, when and how?"] and regulates fluid loss by manipulating the urinary tract. This pathway allows water reabsorption within the body and decreases the amount of water lost through perspiration. ADH has the greatest["greatest among what?"] effect on blood pressure within the body. Under normal circumstances, ADH will regulate the blood pressure and increase or decrease the blood volume when needed. However, when stress becomes chronic, homeostatic regulation of blood pressure is lost. Vasopressin is released and causes a static increase in blood pressure. This increase in blood pressure under stressful conditions ensures that muscles receive the oxygen that they need to be active and respond accordingly. If these stressful conditions remain elevated, muscles will become fatigued, resulting in hypertension and in extreme cases can result in death.
Thyroxine axis.
The third physiological response results in the release of thyrotropic hormone-release factor (TRF)["Where, when and how?"] which results in the release of thyrotropic hormone (TTH). TTH stimulates the release of thyroxine and triiodothyronine from the thyroid. This results in an increased basal metabolic rate (BMR).["What effect does that have?"] This effect is not as immediate as the other two, and can take days to weeks to become prevalent.
Chronic stress.
Chronic stress is a stressor that is ongoing for a long period of time. When chronic stress is experienced, our body is in a state of continuous physiological arousal. Normally, our body activates our fight-or-flight-response, and when the perceived stress is over our body returns to a state of homeostasis. When chronic stress is perceived, however, the body is in a continuous state of fight-or-flight response and never reaches a state of homeostasis. The physiological effects of chronic stress can negatively affect memory and learning. One study used rats to show the effects of chronic psychosocial stress on memory by exposing them to a cat for five weeks and being randomly assigned to a different group each day. Their stress was measured in a naturalistic setting by observing their open field behaviour, and the effect on memory was estimated using the radial arm water maze (RAWM). In the RAWM, rats are taught the place of a platform that is placed below the surface of the water. They must recall this later to discover the platform to exit the water. It was found that the rats exposed to chronic psychosocial stress could not learn to adapt to new situations and environments, and had impaired memory on the RAWM.
Chronic stress affects a person’s cognitive functioning differently than a person with cognitively normal subjects versus a person with mild cognitive impairment. Chronic stress and elevated cortisol (a biomarker for stress) has been known to lead to dementia in elderly people. A longitudinal study was performed which included 61 cognitively normal people and 41 people who suffered from mild cognitive impairment. The participants were between 65 to 97 years old. 52 of the participants were followed for three years and repeatedly received stress and cognitive test assessments. Any patient that suffered from signs or conditions that would affect their cortisol level or cognitive functioning was exempt from participating.
In general, higher event based stress was associated with more rapid cognitive impairment. However, participants with greater cortisol levels showed signs of slower decline. Neither of these effects held for the non-cognitively-impaired group.
Acute stress.
Acute stress is a stressor that is an immediate perceived threat. Unlike chronic stress, acute stress is not ongoing and the physiological arousal associated with acute stress is not nearly as demanding. There are mixed findings on the effects of acute stress on memory. One view is that acute stress can impair memory, while others believe that acute stress can actually enhance memory. For acute stress to enhance memory certain circumstances must be met. First, the context in which the stress is being perceived must match the context of the information or material being encoded. Second, the brain regions involved in the retrieval of the memory must match the regions targeted by glucocorticoids. There are also differences in the type of information being remembered or being forgotten while being exposed to acute stress. In some cases neutral stimuli tend to be remembered, while emotionally charged (salient) stimuli tend to be forgotten. In other cases the opposite effect is obtained. What seems to be an important factor in determining what will be impaired and what will be enhanced is the timing of the perceived stressful exposure and the timing of the retrieval. For emotionally salient information to be remembered, the perceived stress must be induced before encoding, and retrieval must follow shortly afterwards. In contrast, for emotionally charged stimuli to be forgotten, the stressful exposure must be after encoding and retrieval must follow after a longer delay.
If stressful information is relatable to a person, the event more prone to be stored in permanent memory. When a person is under stress, the sympathetic system will shift to a constantly (tonically) active state. To further study how acute stress affect memory formation, a study would appropriate to add examine. Acute stress exposure induces the activation of different hormonal and neurotransmitters which effect the memory's working processes.
A study published in 2009 tested eighteen young healthy males between 19 to 31 years old. All participants were right-handed and had no history of a head injury, or of any medication that could affect a person central nervous system or endocrine system. All of the volunteers participated in two different sessions a month apart. The study consisted on the participants viewing movie clips and pictures that belonged to two different categories: neutral or negative. The participants had to memorize then rate each movie clip or picture by pressing a button with their right hand. They were also monitored in other areas such as their heart rate, pupil diameter, and stress measures by collection of saliva throughout the experiment. The participants mood was assessed by using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule.
The results from the study confirmed that there were physiological measures in regard to stress induction. The participant’s heart rate was elevated and pupil dilation was decreased when viewing the pictures. The study also showed psychological measures that proved that stress induction did cause an increase in subjective stress. In regard to memory enhancement, participants that were shown a stressful picture, often remembered them a day later, which is in accordance with the theory that negative incidents have lasting effects on our memory.
Acute stress can also affect a person’s neural correlates which interfere with the memory formation. During a stressful time, a person’s attention and emotional state may be affected, which could hinder the ability to focus while processing an image. Stress can also enhance the neural state of memory formation.
Short-term memory.
Short-term memory (STM) is the ability to store small amounts of information for a limited amount of time. The "Miller's Law" that the capacity of an average person's STM is 7±2 objects, and lasts for a matter of seconds. This means that when given a series of items to remember, most people can remember 5-9 of those items, the average being 7. However, this limit can be increased by rehearsing the information. Information in STM can be transferred to long-term memory (LTM) by rehearsal and association with other information previously stored in LTM.
Most of the research on stress and memory has been done on working memory (WM), as opposed to STM.
Working memory.
Working memory (WM), similar to STM, is the ability to temporarily store information in order to manipulate it for performing complex tasks, such as reasoning.
WM is affected to a greater extent by stress than LTM. Stress has been shown to both improve and impair WM. In a study by Duncko "et al.", the positive effect of stress manifested itself as a decreased reaction time in participants, while the negative effect of stress causes more false alarms and mistakes when compared to a normal condition. The researchers hypothesize that this could be representative of faster information processing, something helpful in a threatening situation. Anxiety has also been shown to adversely affect some of the components of WM, those being the phonological loop, the visuo-spatial sketchpad, and the central executive. The phonological loop is used for auditory STM, the visuo-spatial sketchpad is used for visual and spatial STM, and the central executive links and controls these systems. The disruption of these components impairs the transfer of information from WM to LTM, thus affecting learning. For instance, several studies have demonstrated that acute stress can impair working memory processing likely though reduced neural activity in the prefrontal cortex in both monkeys and humans [40,41] (Qin et al., 2009: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000632230900300X; Porcelli et al., 2009: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.368.5822&rep=rep1&type=pdf). Moreover, these modulatory effects seem to depend on individuals with different geneotypes (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3350069/).
Long-term memory.
Long-term memory (LTM) is the ability to store an unlimited amount of information over long periods of time, ranging from a few days to many years.
Less is known about the effect of stress on LTM than is known about the effect of stress on STM. This could be due to the fact that LTM is not affected as severely as STM and WM are, and is also influenced by the effect of stress on STM and WM.
The major effect of stress on LTM is that it improves consolidation of memory, while also impairing the reconsolidation of memory. That is, one will be able to remember information relating to a stressful situation after the fact, but while in a stressful situation it is hard to recall specific information. In a study by Park "et al." done on rats, the researchers found that shock induced stress caused the rats to forget what they learned in the phase prior to the shock, but to have distinct memory for where the shock occurred. This negative effect on reconsolidation of memories caused by stress can be attributed to cortisol, the stress hormone that is released in stressful situations.
A study by Marin "et al." demonstrated that stress enhances recall of information reviewed prior to the stressful situation, and that this effect is long lasting.
Explicit memory.
Explicit memory, or declarative memory, is the intentional recall of past events or learned information and is a discipline of LTM. Explicit memory includes memory for remembering a specific event, such as dinner the week prior, or information about the world, such as the definition for explicit memory. When an anxious state is provoked, percentage recall on explicit memory tasks is enhanced. However, this effect is only present for emotionally associated words. Stress hormones influence the processes carried out in the hippocampus and amygdala which are also associated with emotional responses. Thus, emotional memories are enhanced when stress is induced, as they are both associated with the same areas of the brain, whereas neutral stimuli and stress are not. However, enhancement of explicit memory depends on the time of day. Explicit memory is enhanced by stress when assessed in the afternoon, but impaired when assessed in the morning. Basal cortisol levels are relatively low in the afternoon and much higher in the morning, which can alter the interaction and effects of stress hormones.
Implicit memory.
Implicit memory, or more precisely procedural memory, is memory of information without conscious awareness or ability to verbalize the process, and is also a discipline of LTM. There are three types of implicit memory, which are: conditioning (emotional behavior), tasks and priming (verbal behavior). For example, the process of riding a bicycle cannot be verbalized, but the action can still be executed. When implicit memory is assessed in tandem with stressful cues there is no change in procedural recall.
Autobiographical memory.
Autobiographical memory is personal episodic memory of self-related information and specific events. Stress tends to impair the accuracy of autobiographical memories, but does not impair the frequency or confidence in them. After exposure to an emotional and stressful negative event, flashback memories can be evident. However, the more flashback memories present, the less accurate the autobiographical memory. Both aspects of autobiographical memory, episodic memory, the memory system regarding specific events, and semantic memory, the memory system regarding general information about the world, are impaired by an event that induces a stressful response. This causes the recall of an experience of a specific event and the information about the event to be recalled less accurately.
Autobiographical memory, however, is not impaired on a continual decline from the first recall of the information when anxiety is induced. At first recall attempt, the memory is fairly accurate. The impairment begins when reconsolidation is present, such that the more times the memory is brought to conscious awareness, the less accurate it will become. When stress is induced the memory will be susceptible to other influences, such as suggestions from other people, or emotions unrelated to the event but present during recall. Therefore, stress at the encoding of an event positively influences memory, but stress at the time of recollection impairs memory.
Attention.
Attention is the process by which a concentration is focused on a point of interest, such as an event or physical stimulus. It is theorized that attention toward a stimulus will increase ability to recall information, therefore enhancing memory. When threatening information or a stimulus that provokes anxiety are present, it is difficult to release attention from the negative cue. When in a state of high anxiety, a conceptual memory bias is produced toward the negative stimulus. Therefore, it is difficult to redirect the attention focus away from the negative, anxiety provoking cue. This increases the activation of the pathways associated with the threatening cues, and thus increases the ability to recall the information present while in a high anxious state. However, when in a high anxious state and presented with positive information, there is no memory bias produced. This occurs because it is not as difficult to redirect attention from the positive stimulus as it is from the negative stimulus. This is due to the fact that the negative cue is perceived as a factor in the induced stress, whereas the positive cue is not.
Learning.
Learning is the modification of behaviour by experience. For example, learning to avoid certain stimuli such as a tornadoes, thunderstorms, large animals, and toxic chemicals, because they can be harmful. This is classified as aversion conditioning, and is related to fear responses.
Fear response.
An anxious state at the time of learning can create a stronger aversion to the stimuli. A stronger aversion can lead to stronger associations in memory between the stimulus and response, therefore enhancing the memory of the response to the stimulus. When extinction is attempted in male and female humans, compared to a neutral control without anxiety, extinction does not occur. This suggests that memory is enhanced for learning, specifically fear learning, when anxiety is present.
Reversal learning.
Conversely, reversal learning["What is it?"] is inhibited by the presence of anxiety. Reversal learning is assessed through the reversal learning task; a stimulus and response relationship is learned through the trial and error method and then without notice, the relationship is reversed, examining the role of cognitive flexibility. Inhibited reversal learning can be associated with the idea that subjects experiencing symptoms of anxiety frustrate easily and are unable to successfully adapt to a changing environment. Thus, anxiety can negatively affect learning when the stimulus and response relationship are reversed or altered.
Stress, memory and animals.
Much of the research relating to stress and memory has been conducted on animals and can be generalized to humans. One type of stress that is not easily translatable to humans is predator stress: the anxiety an animal experiences when in the presence of a predator. In studies, stress is induced by introducing a predator to a subject either before the learning phase or between the learning phase and the testing phase. Memory is measured by various tests, such as the radial arm water maze (RAWM). In the RAWM, rats are taught the location of a hidden platform and must recall this information later on to find the platform and get out of the water.
Short-term memory.
Predator Stress has been shown to impair STM. It has been determined that this effect on STM is not due to the fact that a predator is a novel and arousing stimulus, but rather because of the fear that is provoked in the test subjects by the predator.
Long-term memory.
Predator stress has been shown to increase LTM. In a study done by Sundata "et al." on snails, it was shown that when trained in the presence of a predator, snails' memory persisted for at least 24 hours in adults, while it usually lasts only 3 hours. Juvenile snails, who usually do not have any LTM showed signs of LTM after exposure to a predator.
Classical conditioning.
Predator stress has been shown to improve classical conditioning in males and hinder it in females. A study done by Maeng "et al." demonstrated that stress allowed faster classical conditioning of male rats while disrupting the same type of learning in female rats. These gender differences were shown to be caused by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). When the researchers inactivated that brain region by administering muscimol to the females, no gender differences in classical conditioning were observed 24 hours later. Inactivating the mPFC in the male rats did not prevent the enhanced conditioning that the males previously exhibited. This discrepancy between genders has also been shown to be present in humans. In a 2005 study, Jackson "et al." reported that stress enhanced classical conditioning in human males and impaired classical condition in human females.
Anxiety disorders.
Post-traumatic stress disorder.
Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that can occur after exposure to horrific events, or after a terrifying ordeal where there is immense physical harm that directly or indirectly affects a person. When the memories of these traumas do not subside, a person may begin to avoid anything that would cause them to relive these events. When this persists over an extended period of time, one may be said to be suffering from PTSD. Examples of events that could lead to the onset of PTSD are war, rape, assault, and childhood neglect. It is estimated that approximately 8% of American may suffer from this disease which can lead to long-term problems.
Symptoms include persistent frightened thoughts and memories of the trauma or ordeal and emotional numbness. The individual may experience sleeping problems, be easily startled, or experience feelings of detachment or numbness. Sufferers may experience depression and/or display self-destructive behaviours.
There are 3 Categories of symptoms associated with PTSD:
The most effective treatments for PTSD are psychotherapy, medication, and in some circumstance both. Effective psychotherapy involves helping the individual with managing the symptoms, coping with the traumatic event, and working through the traumatic experiences. Medications such as antidepressants has proven to be an effective way to block the effects of stress and to also promote neurogenesis. The medication phenytoin can also block stress caused to the hippocampus with the help of modulation of excitatory amino acids.
PTSD affects memory recall and accuracy. The more the traumatic event is brought to conscious awareness and recalled, the less accurate the memory. PTSD affects the verbal memory of the traumatic event, but does not affect the memory in general. One of the ways traumatic stress affects individuals is that the traumatic event tends to disrupt the stream of memories people obtain through life, creating memories that do not blend in with the rest. This has the effect of creating a split in identity as the person now has good memories they can attribute to one personality and bad memories the can attribute to the “other” personality. For example, a victim of childhood abuse can group their good and happy experiences under the “pleasant” personality and their abuse experiences under one “bad or wicked” personality. This then creates a split personality disorder. Individuals suffering from post traumatic stress disorder often have difficulty remembering facts, appointments and autobiographical details. The traumatic event can result in psychogenic amnesia and in the occurrence of intrusive recollections of the event. Children with PTSD have deficits in cognitive processes essential for learning; their memory systems also under-performs those of normal children. A study using the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test showed that individuals with PTSD scored lower than controls on the memory test, indicating a poorer general knowledge. The study revealed that 78% of PTSD patients under-performed, and where in the categories labelled “poor memory” or “impaired memory”. PTSD patients were specifically worse at the prospective and orientation items on the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test.
A few studies done in the past proved that PTSD can cause cognition and brain structure changes that involve verbal declarative memory deficits. Children that have experienced child abuse may according to neuropsychological testing experience a deficit in verbal declarative memory functioning.
Studies have been conducted on people that were involved in the Vietnam War or the Holocaust, returning Iraq soldiers and people that also suffered from rape and childhood abuse. Different tests were administered such as the Selective Reminding Test, Verbal Learning Test, Paired Associate Recall, the California Verbal New Learning Test, and the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test. The test results showed that the returning Iraq soldiers did have less verbal memory performance as compared to pre-deployment.
The studies performed on the Vietnam veterans that suffer from PTSD show that there are hippocampal changes in the brain associated with this disorder. The veterans with PTSD showed an 8% reduction in their right hippocampal volume. The patients that suffered from child abuse showed a 12% reduction in their mean left hippocampal volume. Several of the studies has also shown that people with PTSD have deficits while performing verbal declarative memory task in their hippicampal.
PTSD can impact several parts of the brain such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and the prefrontal cortex. The amygdala controls our memory and emotional processing; the hippocampus helps with organizing, storing and memory forming. Hippocampus is the most sensitive area to stress. The prefrontal cortex helps with our expression and personality and helps regulate complex cognitive and our behavior functions.
Social anxiety disorder.
Social anxiety disorder is an anxiety disorder consisting of overwhelming anxiety and excessive self-consciousness in everyday social situations. It is an extreme fear of being scrutinized and judged by others in social and/or performance situations. This fear about a situation can become so severe that it affects work, school, and other typical activities. Social anxiety can be related to one situation (such as talking to people) or it can be much more broad, where a person experiences anxiety around everyone except family members.
People with social anxiety disorder have a constant, chronic fear of being watched and judged by peers and strangers, and of doing something that will embarrass them. People that suffer from this may physically feel sick from the situation, even when the situation is non-threatening. Physical symptoms of the disorder include blushing, profuse sweating, trembling, nausea or abdominal distress, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, dizziness or lightheadedness, headaches, and feelings of detachment. Development of low self-esteem, poor social skills, and trouble being assertive are also common signs of social anxiety disorder.
Social Anxiety Disorder can be treated with many different types of therapy and medication. Exposure therapy is an effective method of treating social anxiety. In exposure therapy a patient is presented with situations that they are afraid of, gradually building up to facing the situation that the patient fears most. This type of therapy helps the patient learn new techniques to cope with different situations that they fear. Role-playing has proven effective for the treatment or social anxiety. Role-playing therapy helps to boost individuals' confidence relating to other people and helps increase social skills. Medication is another effective method for treating social anxiety. Antidepressants, Beta blockers, and anti-anxiety medications are the most commonly prescribed types of medication to treat social anxiety.
Social Phobics display a tendency to recall negative emotions about a situation when asked to recall the event. Their emotions typically revolve around themselves, with no recollection of other people's environments. Social anxiety results in negative aspects of the event to be remembered, leading to a biased opinion of the situation from the perspective of the social phobic compared to the non-social phobic. Social phobics typically displayed better recall than control participants. However, Individuals with social anxiety recalled angry faces rather than happy or neutral faces better than control participants.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) involves both obsessions and compulsions that disrupt daily routines and activities. The obsessions include recurrent unwanted thoughts that cause compulsions, including repetitive behaviors. Individuals that suffer from OCD may realize that their obsessions are not normal and try to stop their actions, but this only increases the person's anxiety towards the situation, and has an adverse effect. OCD often revolves around themes in one's life; for example, fear of coming in contact with germs (obsession). To deal with the fear of germs one may compulsively wash their hands until they are chapped. OCD is a constituent of many other disorders including Autism, Tourette’s syndrome, and frontal lobe lesions.
A person that shows a constant need to complete a certain “ritual”, or is constantly plagued with unwelcome thoughts, may suffer from OCD. Themes of obsessions include fear of germs or dirt, having things orderly and symmetrical, and sexual thoughts and images.
Signs of obsessions:
Compulsions follow the theme of the obsessions, and are repetitive behaviors that individuals suffering from OCD feel will diminish the effect of the obsession. Compulsions also follow the theme, including hand washing, cleaning, performing actions repeatedly, or extreme orderliness.
Signs of compulsions:
Behavior therapy has proven to be an effective method for treating OCD. Patients are exposed to the theme that is typically avoided, while being restricted from performing their usual anxiety reducing rituals. Behavior therapy rarely eliminates OCD, but it helps to reduce the signs and symptoms. With medication, this reduction of the disorder is even more evident. Antidepressants are usually the first prescribed medication to a patient with OCD. Medications that treat OCD typically inhibit the reuptake of serotonin.
Obsessive-compulsive individuals have difficulty forgetting unwanted thoughts. When they encode this information into memory they encode it as a neutral or positive thought. This is inconsistent with what a person without OCD would think about this thought, leading the individual with OCD to continue displaying their specific “ritual” to help deal with their anxiety. When asked to forget information they have encoded, OCD patients have difficult forget what they are told to forget only when the subject is negative. Individuals not affected by OCD do not show this tendency. Researchers have proposed a general deficit hypothesis for memory related problems in OCD. There are limited studies investigating this hypothesis. These studies propose that memory is enhanced for menacing events that have occurred during the individuals life. For example a study demonstrated that individuals with OCD exhibit exceptional recall for previously encountered events, but only when the event promoted anxiety in the individual.

Coalition Avenir Québec

The Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ; , "Coalition for Quebec's Future"), is a provincial political party in Quebec, Canada.
It was founded by former Parti Québécois (PQ) cabinet minister François Legault and businessman Charles Sirois; Legault also serves as the party leader of CAQ. The party membership includes both Quebec nationalists and federalists, however its leader Francois Legault has said it will never endorse a referendum or sovereignty, but more autonomy if necessary.
Not long after its formation, the party gained nine sitting Members of the National Assembly of Quebec (MNAs) who had originally been elected as members of the PQ and of the Action démocratique du Québec (ADQ); the latter party merged with the CAQ in January 2012. The party is formally registered with the Director-General of Elections in Quebec under the name Coalition avenir Québec - L'équipe François Legault (Coalition Avenir Quebec-Team François Legault).
Members and supporters of the party are referred to as "caquistes", derived from the French pronunciation of the party's initials. However, the party originally requested that the term "coalisés" be used instead.
History.
In February 2011, François Legault and Charles Sirois held a press conference to announce the formation of a movement to be known as the "Coalition pour l'avenir du Québec", literally "Coalition for the Future of Quebec".
In September 2011, the CAQ began discussions with the ADQ on the possibility of a merger between the two groups.
On November 14, 2011, Legault held a press conference to launch the movement as a political party under the slightly modified name of Coalition Avenir Québec, unveiling a new logo at the same time. The actual registration of the party with the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec had already taken place on 4 November.
On December 13, 2011, the coalition and the ADQ announced an agreement in principle to merge, pending final approval with the ADQ membership.
On December 19, 2011, two former PQ MNAs (Benoit Charette, Daniel Ratthé) and two former ADQ MNAs (Éric Caire and Marc Picard) who had earlier left their respective parties to sit as independents announced that they were joining the CAQ.
In January 2012, PQ MNA François Rebello switched party affiliation to the CAQ, becoming its fifth sitting member.
On January 21, 2012, the results of the ADQ's mail-in vote were announced: of the 54% of members who voted, 70% approved the merger with the CAQ. The ADQ's four remaining MNAs -- Sylvie Roy of Lotbinière, Janvier Grondin of Beauce-Nord, François Bonnardel of Shefford, and leader Gérard Deltell of Chauveau—joined the CAQ, boosting its caucus to nine.
On January 23, 2012, the CAQ announced its first president, Dominique Anglade, who would also be a candidate for the party in the next election.
On August 5, 2012, Jacques Duchesneau, the whistleblower behind Quebec's anti-corruption unit, announced his candidacy for the riding of Saint-Jérôme in the 2012 provincial election. He won the MNA seat.
On September 4, 2012, the CAQ won 19 seats in the National Assembly September 2012 provincial election.
2014 Quebec general election.
In the 2014 provincial election held on April 7, the CAQ won 22 seats, a gain of three seats. The TVA-sponsored second televised debate was noted as a turning point in the campaign and party leader François Legault's performance reflected positively on the CAQ's standing. Therefore, early voting results revealed a disastrous outcome for the party, while ballots cast on Election Day were much more favorable.
Also, overall returns marked a significant geographic shift in the CAQ electoral base.
In the Capitale-Nationale area, reputed for its conservative leanings and the influence of its talk-radio hosts, the Quebec Liberal Party won four of the six seats previously held by the CAQ. A strategic vote of the anti-Parti Québécois electorate, as well as a pledge by Legault to spend no public money on projects dear to Mayor Régis Labeaume, such as the construction of a $ 97.5 million covered ice rink, the completion of the $ 60 million theater Le Diamant, promoted by Robert Lepage, and the $ 20 million revitalization of the French colonial era new barracks, are possible causes for the backlash.
The CAQ losses in the Capitale-Nationale area were largely compensated with a significant breakthrough in the “450 area” (Laurentides, Lanaudière and Montérégie), where it ended up with 7 more seats.
Meanwhile, the CAQ support in Chaudière-Appalaches and Centre-du-Québec remained steady.
Official positions.
The party proposes government investment in education and partial decentralisation of the healthcare system. They promise "to further develop the entrepreneurial culture in Québec" and provide government resources for the private sector. The party also supports austerity "to provide the government with the flexibility it needs to adapt to the ongoing changes in the economy"; one measure specifically mentioned is leaving 6,000 open Hydro-Québec employment positions unfilled. Although the party does not support independence, it advocates Quebec nationalism. This includes limiting immigration and promoting the use of French without creating new barriers. The party supports multiculturalism insofar as to "integrate newcomers".
According to the party, Quebec is defined by "its historical heritage, the French language, its democratic ideals and the principles of the secularity of the State, and equality among men and women".
On April 10, 2014, the party stated that it would never hold a referendum: "(There) will never be a referendum for the life of the coalition even after 10 years, even after 20 years, so that's clear. And I was clear but people understood something else." François Legault also pointed out that "Once it is clear that there will never be a referendum with the Coalition Avenir Québec, the anglophones and allophones, who don’t want a referendum, have to understand that we offer an alternative to the Liberals.”
The party describes itself as of neither the left nor the right: It describes itself as conservative on economic issues, while liberal on social issues, however its politics have been described in the press as centre-right.
Projet St-Laurent.
The centerpiece of the Coalition's policy platform is the Projet St-Laurent, a detailed program designed to modernize Quebec's economy, education and health systems.

Spider (Bourgeois)

Spider is a sculpture by Louise Bourgeois.
Executed in 1996 as an edition of six and cast in 1997; bronze with a silver nitrate patina, with the first of the edition being steel.
An example was acquired by the Denver Art Museum for its new addition in 2006.
Other locations in permanent collections include the National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden, Washington DC, and the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, Kansas City, Missouri.
Exhibitions.
The steel "Spider" was exhibited at Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal from April to September, 1996. Various editions of this artwork have traveled extensively, including an example shown at the Hermitage Museum in 2001.
Art market.
In 2006, Bourgeois became the highest-paid living woman artist after a "Spider" sold for $4 million at Christie's in London; which was surpassed in 2008, when another "Spider" sold for $4.5 million. A new record price for the artist was achieved when "Spider" number two acquired from Gallery Paule Anglim, San Francisco, was auctioned by a private collector with an estimate of $4 million to $6 million. The price realized at Christie's on 8 November 2011 was $10,722,500. This is the highest price paid for an artwork by a woman artist at the time.

United Nations Security Council Resolution 1971

United Nations Security Council Resolution 1971, adopted unanimously on March 3, 2011, after recalling previous resolutions on the situation in Liberia and Sierra Leone, including Resolution 1626 (2005), the Council requested the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) to withdraw its military personnel providing security for the Special Court for Sierra Leone, and placed the responsibility for security with the Sierra Leone Police.
Resolution.
Observations.
Resolution 1626 had authorised an UNMIL contingent to protect the Special Court. The Security Council praised the role of UNMIL, particularly the Mongolian contingent of the mission. It noted that the Registrar of the Special Court had stated that there would be no need for a military guard after February 2011, while the Sierra Leone government had requested that a withdrawal be postponed until late February or early March 2011. 
Acts.
Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council ended the authorisation given to 150 UNMIL personnel to protect the Special Court and asked it to withdraw by 7 March 2011. UNMIL could also no longer evacuate officials of the Special Court in the event of an emergency. The Council awaited security to be provided by local security, while the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone (UNIPSIL) was instructed to include officials of the Special Court within its evacuation procedures.

The Eternal Husband

The Eternal Husband (, "Vechny muzh") is a novel by Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky that was first published in 1870 in "Zarya" magazine. The novella's plot revolves around the complicated relationship between Velchaninov and Trusotsky, the husband of his deceased former lover.
Plot summary.
Alexei Ivanovich Velchaninov is a land owner who stays in Saint Petersburg for a trial about a piece of land. He receives a visit from Pavel Pavlovich Trusotsky, an old acquaintance who recently became a widower. Velchaninov had an affair with Trusotsky's wife Natalia, and he realizes that he is the biological father of Liza, Trusotsky's eight-year-old daughter. Velchaninov, who doesn't want Liza to be raised by an alcoholic, brings Liza to a foster family. Liza dies there.
Trusotsky now wants to marry Nadia, the fifteen-year-old daughter of civil servant Zakhlyobinin. She's the sixth daughter of eight. Trusotsky takes Velchaninov with him to visit his fiancee, and buys her a bracelet. Trusotsky is ridiculed by Zakhlyobinin's daughters and locked up during a game of hide-and-seek. Nadia gives the bracelet to Velchaninov, asking him to return it to Trusotsky and tell him she doesn't want to marry him. Nadia is secretly engaged to Alexander Lobov, a nineteen-year-old boy.
Trusotsky spends the night in Velchaninov's room and tries to kill him with a razor knife. Velchaninov manages to defend himself, injuring his left hand. 
Sometime later, when Velchaninov has won his trial, the two meet again at a railway station. Trusotsky is remarried, but a young army officer is travelling with him and his wife. Trusotsky's new wife invites Velchaninov to visit them, but Trusotsky asks him to ignore this invitation.
Analysis.
The story starts in medias res. Details about Velchaninov's adulterous past are revealed gradually.
The novel is comparable to a tragicomedy. The main tragic event is Liza's death. The comical element is the character of Trusotsky, who seems to be predestined to be the cuckold every time again.
Critical reception.
"The Eternal Husband" is one of Dostoyevsky lesser known novels. The subject of a deceived husband is lighter than in his other novels, but some critics say this novel ranks among his best works because of its style and structure. Alfred Bem calls it "one of the most complete works by Dostoyevsky in regards to its composition and development."

Freda Adler

Freda Adler (born 1934) is a criminologist and educator, currently serving as Professor Emeritus at Rutgers University and a visiting Professor at the University of Pennsylvania. She was President of the American Society of Criminology in 1994-1995. She has acted as a consultant to the United Nations on criminal justice matters since 1975, holding various roles within United Nations organizations. A prolific writer, Adler has published in a variety of criminological areas, including female criminality, international issues in crime, piracy, drug abuse, and social control theories.
Adler received a B.A. in sociology, her M.A. in criminology, and her Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Pennsylvania, under the guidance of professor Thorsten Sellin, publishing her Ph.D. dissertation in 1971. She began her career in criminal justice as an evaluator of drug and alcohol treatment programs for federal and state governments. For several decades she has taught subjects such as criminal justice, criminology, comparative criminal justice systems, statistics, and research methods.
Adler first gained prominence in 1975 by articulating a controversial theory (known generally as the Liberation Theory of Female Criminality) in which she predicted rising crime rates for women as a result of the success of the women’s liberation movement. In other words, according to this theory the feministic social movement had increased women’s opportunities, and thirst, for crime. From a criminological viewpoint, her thesis strongly contradicted the pathological explanations of female criminality prevalent in the preceding century. By the following year, with the publication of her book, "Sisters in Crime: The Rise of the New Female Criminal", she was reported as being "billed as the 'foremost female criminologist in the United States'"
Adler's publications include thirteen books as author or co-author, nine edited or co-edited books, and over 100 journal articles. She is the recipient of the Beccaria Medal in Gold of the Deutsche Kriminologische Gesellschaft (representing Germany, Luxembourg and Switzerland), the Chi Omega Sociology Award, the American Society of Criminology International Division Award, and the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences Founder's Award. She has occasionally collaborated with her husband, Gerhard O.W. Mueller, who served as chief of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice section.
Adler has three children, Mark, Jill, and Nanci. Adler's husband died on April 20, 2006.

<doc id="31110955" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31110955" title="Memory and social interactions">
Memory and social interactions

Memory underpins and enables social interactions in a variety of ways. In order to engage in successful social interaction, organisms must be able to remember how they should interact with one another, whom they have interacted with previously, and what occurred during those interactions.
Failure in any of these areas can lead to social rejection or violent conflict, which can be detrimental to an organism's well being.
Memory for Faces.
The ability to visually identify previous social partners is essential for successful interactions because it aids in recognizing which partners can and cannot be trusted. In humans, this is accomplished by facial recognition. Research suggests that humans are born with an innate ability to process other human faces. In one study, Pascalis, et al. (1995) found that four-day-old neonates (infants) prefer to look at their mothers' faces rather than at a stranger's. This finding suggests that neonates are able to remember, recognize, and differentiate between faces. Further research suggests that humans prefer to attend to faces rather than non-face alternatives. Such specialized processing for faces aids in the encoding of memory for people. This preference is one explanation for why humans are more proficient at memorizing faces than non-faces.
Brain Structures.
There are several areas of the brain associated with this highly specialized form of memory.
Fusiform face area.
The fusiform face area (FFA) is associated with facial recognition. It is generally located on the fusiform gyrus in the temporal lobe, but its precise location varies between individuals. The FFA has been found to show a degree of lateralization. Typically, it is larger in the right hemisphere of the brain. It is widely accepted that the FFA is involved in the encoding and retrieval of memory for faces and other familiar categorical processing.
Damage to the FFA has been shown to lead to severe deficits in facial recognition and processing. These deficits can lead to difficulty in maintaining normal social relationships over an extended period.
Amygdala.
The amygdala is one of the major structures in the limbic system. It is also known to play a role in the processing of and memory for emotional events.
One study, performed by Adolphs, et al. (1998), found striking differences in perceived trustworthiness and approachability ratings between subjects with complete bilateral amygdala damage and a control group. The results showed that all of the amygdally impaired subjects rated unfamiliar faces as much more trustworthy and approachable than familiar faces. Furthermore, the impaired subjects rated faces as trustworthy which the control group considered dubious. These findings illustrate a large difference in the amygdally impaired subjects' perception of faces. The same study went on to determine whether or not the difference generalizes to an auditory description of a person. Interestingly enough, the impaired subjects made entirely normal perceptions in this task. Overall, the research suggests that the amygdala is important for the making and retrieval of social judgements.
Hippocampus.
The hippocampus is a structure located in the medial temporal lobe. It is thought to be involved in the encoding, consolidation and retrieval of memories. This structure's function is probably best known from specific case studies, the most famous being Henry Molaison, formerly known as patient H.M., whose medial temporal lobes were bilaterally removed in an attempt to cure his epileptic seizures. As a result, he experienced severe anterograde amnesia.
Difficulties with Facial Recognition.
Several disorders or impairments have been found to disrupt an individual's ability to successfully process faces.
Autism Spectrum Disorders.
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurological development disorders characterized by repetitive behaviours and impaired social skills. Patients with ASD are also characterized by over-selectivity, which is a tendency to attend to only a few stimuli. Over-selectivity causes memory encoding problems, as relevant information is not attended to, and thus not stored in memory. These encoding problems are associated with an impaired memory for faces, which is in turn associated with impairments in social functioning.
Prosopagnosia.
Prosopagnosia is an inability to identify faces and face-like objects. This represents a failure to encode incoming visual information. Neurological studies indicate that prosopagnosia is associated with bilateral lesions of the central visual system, primarily located in the mesial occipitotemporal region. The inability to correctly recognize a face can have detrimental consequences for building social relationships due to the fact that recognition is required for associating feelings or experiences with a stimulus.
Memory for previous interactions.
Memory for previous interactions is critical for successful long-term social relationships. This is largely due to a human expectation of reciprocity, which requires humans to have a better memory for favours or debts owed. These memories play an important role in deciding whether or not a human interacts with another in the future, as they contribute to the construction of a person's reputation. Milinski, Semmann & Krambeck (2002) have demonstrated, through the use of public goods games and indirect reciprocity games, that humans are less likely to interact with those who have a reputation for not equivalently returning the favour.
Research indicates that long-term memory can directly influence a person's choice of strategy during interaction. Participants with normal memory functioning were found to use a wider variety of techniques in the Prisoner's Dilemma task. Thus, memory constraints alter the strategies used during social interactions.
Evolutionary psychologists have shown that memories for social interactions are subject to natural selection. As demonstrated through free recall and recognition tasks, humans are able to discern between cooperators and cheaters in social interactions.
Impression formation.
The impressions humans leave each other with after interactions, whether active or passive, help to build reputations.
A study by Espejo (2003) has demonstrated that the extent of a social interaction does not significantly impact short-term memory retention for that interaction. This indicates that the processes by which impressions are formed do not take much time to occur. Furthermore, as these results were demonstrated in rats with lesioning in the medial prefrontal cortex, a key brain structure for social interaction, they suggest a multi-component system of memory. However, a study by Belmore (1987) on impression formation and serial position indicated that behaviours from early in an acquaintance are no better recalled than later events.
Expectations about a person can influence what is remembered about that individual after an initial interaction. Therefore, such information impacts the impression one person makes on another. For example, Srull (1981) found that people had better recall for memories of a person acting in a way opposite to previous expectations. This was attributed to the repeated retrieval of such memories in attempts to reconcile them with the person’s reputation.
Furthermore, the memories that contribute to an impression appear to be influenced by negativity and the source of behaviour. Research on the subject indicates that people are more likely to remember negative behaviour when it is perceived as coming from a moral or dispositional source, and positive behaviour when seen as coming from either a person’s ability or a need to suit the situation. Positive behaviours result from a desire to appear socially acceptable, whereas negative behaviours are more revealing of the individual's personality. Thus, negative behaviours lead to more questioning of the individual’s actual personality, which in turn results in more methodical processing of that person’s behaviour. This is believed to produce better memory for events by forming more associative links to the memory of that behaviour. However, positive behaviour may also be subject to this improved memory if there is reason to doubt the behaviour. If a critical assessment of an individual’s actions results in a contrast to their positive image, the amount of interaction with that person will decrease.
Memory for cheaters and cooperators.
From a psychological standpoint, friends and foes have been defined in a number of ways, but do not have a consistent operational definition. One definition of friends and foes is as cheaters and non-cheaters, with non-cheaters also referred to as cooperators. Cheaters are defined as those who benefit from cooperation, but endure no costs, thereby discouraging cooperators. Cheaters benefit from others’ cooperation without the costs of reciprocation. Cooperation is risky because those who cooperate gamble with the possibility of being exploited by a cheater.
Enhanced memory for faces of cheaters has been well demonstrated in humans. Specifically, when exposed to trustworthy and untrustworthy faces, the memories of untrustworthy faces persist longer through an extinction procedure than do trustworthy faces, and when presented with pictures of faces with accompanying descriptions of cheating, trustworthy, or irrelevant information, people have enhanced source memory for the faces of cheaters. However, the existence of a cognitive module specific to cheater detection is the subject of scientific debate. While enhanced memory for cheaters is most likely due to a specific cognitive module, there is currently insufficient evidence to support the existence of this specific module due to the difficulty of demonstrating such an evolutionary cognitive trait.
Cheater recognition is closely related to the recognition of specific emotions. Bell et al. argue for the existence of an emotional incongruity effect. Memory is better for the face of a smiling cheater than of a smiling cooperator, because the incongruity captures the attention of the participant. If the emotion violates the expectancy then it is much better remembered. Furthermore, negative information is much better remembered whether it violates expectancies or not. Negative emotions have a strong effect on source memory due to the presence of threatening stimuli.
Memory is determined by the emotional reaction of people at the encoding stage for both trustworthy and cheaters' facial expressions. Furthermore, encoding levels process the recognition for traits and features of face recognition over expression of the face. Memory is more readily remembered for emotionally involving information than for emotionally neutral information.
Friends and foes are represented differently in the brain. The fusiform cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, amygdala, and areas involved in motivational control were differentially activated as a function of previous social encounters. In general, these areas were more active when faces were perceived as foes rather than friends.
Destination memory.
Destination memory is the ability to remember information one has conveyed to others. Telling a story multiple times, unaware that listeners have heard the story before, is an example of destination memory failure. Destination memory is important for conversations because it allows people to recall what was already talked about. Deficiency in destination memory is more common among older adults, but has been reported by university students as well. Destination memory is notoriously poor due to ineffective integration of components of episodic memory. However, there appear to be few, if any, negative social implications for poor destination memory.
Implicit memory.
Implicit memory is the non-declarative, or unspoken, aspects of memory. Priming, motor memory and classical conditioning are all examples of implicit memory. An example of implicit memory's effect on our social interactions has been illustrated by the pin-in-hand phenomenon. This phenomenon was first observed by Claparède while dealing with an amnesiac patient. Normally, he would shake the patient's hand and introduce himself, as the patient thought it was their first time meeting. However, on one occasion he hid a pin and pricked the patient with it when she reached to shake his hand. Later, when he offered his hand, she drew away and refused to shake, in spite of the fact she could not explicitly recall the pinprick itself. The patient was unable to provide a reason for her hesitation.
Memory for social norms.
Social norms are unspoken rules that govern acceptable behaviours in a given social situation. Violation of these norms can be considered extremely offensive, and may lead to social rejection. Thus, it is adaptive to be able to adhere to social norms, which requires memory of them. As a person matures, they tend to passively gain an intricate understanding of the norms associated with their culture.
Schemata.
One way memory can affect social interactions is through schemata. A schema is a mental structure implemented in order to sort knowledge around central themes or subjects. Although schemata develop from experience, not all experiences are organized with schemata. Schemata can influence the way in which new people and situations are understood, which has a direct impact on social interaction.
Many research studies have been conducted concerning the effect of schemata on individuals' perceptions of others. It has been found that preschoolers are aware of gender schemata and are capable of pointing out behaviours which are inconsistent with them. In a Canadian study, participants were asked to rate various diverse groups based on how well a given characteristic applied to them. The results confirmed that participants were quicker to assign a rating if the given characteristics fit the schema for that group.
Schemata have been proposed as a way to explain the persistence of stereotypes. According to this theory, negative stereotypes persist because information that is incongruent with a schema is not organized and thus less likely to be remembered. Therefore, schemata influence what information is encoded and retrieved from memory, thereby influencing social interactions.
Impairments.
Any condition that causes a memory deficit will have an impact on social functioning. This will differ based on the nature and severity of the deficit. For example, patients with Alzheimer's disease have difficulty during social interactions because of agnosia, and aphasia.

Memory errors

Memory gaps and errors refer to the incorrect recall, or complete loss, of information in the memory system for a specific detail and/or event. Memory errors may include remembering events that never occurred, or remembering them differently from the way they actually happened. These errors or gaps can occur due to a number of different reasons, including the emotional involvement in the situation, expectations and environmental changes. As the retention interval between encoding and retrieval of the memory lengthens, there is an increase in both the amount that is forgotten, and the likelihood of a memory error occurring.
Overview.
There are several different types of memory errors, in which people may inaccurately recall details of events that did not occur, or they may simply misattribute the source of a memory. In other instances, imagination of a certain event can create confidence that such an event actually occurred. Causes of such memory errors may be due to certain cognitive factors, such as spreading activation, or to physiological factors, including brain damage, age or emotional factors. Furthermore, memory errors have been reported in individuals with schizophrenia and depression. The consequences of memory errors can have significant implications. Two main areas of concern regarding memory errors are in eyewitness testimony and cases of child abuse.
Types of memory errors.
Blocking.
The feeling that a person gets when they know the information, but can not remember a specific detail, like an individuals name or the name of a place is described as the ""tip-of-the-tongue"" experience.The "tip-of-the-tongue" experience is a classic example of blocking, which is a failure to retrieve information that is available in memory even though you are trying to produce it. The information you are trying to remember has been encoded and stored, and a cue is available that would usually trigger its recollection. The information has not faded from memory and a person is not forgetting to retrieve the information. What a person is experiencing is a complete retrieval failure, which makes blocking especially frustrating. Blocking occurs especially often for the names of people and places, because their links to related concepts and knowledge are weaker than for common names. The experience of blocking occurs more often as we get older; this "tip of the tongue" experience is a common complaint amongst 60 and 70 year olds.
Transience.
Transience refers to forgetting what occurs with the passage of time. Transience occurs during the storage phase of memory, after an experience has been encoded and before it is retrieved. As time passes, the quality of our memory also changes, deteriorating from specific to more general. German philosopher named Hermann Ebbinghaus decided to measure his own memory for lists of nonsense syllables at various times after studying them. He decided to draw out a curve of his forgetting pattern over time. He realized that there is a rapid drop-off in retention during the first tests and there is a slower rate of forgetting later on. Therefore, transience denotes the gradual change of a specific knowledge or idea into more general memories.
Absentmindedness.
Absentmindedness is a gap in attention which causes memory failure. In this situation the information does not disappear from memory, it can later be recalled. But the lack of attention at a specific moment prevents the information from being recalled at that specific moment. A common cause of absentmindedness is a lack of attention. Attention is vital to encoding information in long-term memory. Without proper attention, material is much less likely to be stored properly and recalled later. When attention is divided, less activity in the lower left frontal lobe diminishes the ability for elaborative memory encoding to take place, and results in absentminded forgetting. More recent research has shown that divided attention also leads to less hippocampal involvement in encoding. A common cause of absentmindedness is not being able to remember to carry out actions that had been planned to be done in the future, for example, picking up grocery items, and remembering times of meetings.
False memories.
False memories, sometimes referred to as confabulation, refer to the recollection of inaccurate details of an event, or recollection of a whole event that never occurred. Studies investigating this memory error have been able to successfully implant memories among participants that never existed, such as being lost in a mall as a child (termed the lost in the mall technique) or spilling a bowl of punch at a wedding reception. In this case, false memories were implanted among participants by their family members who claimed that the event had happened. This evidence demonstrates the possibility of implanting false memories on individuals by leading them to remember such events that never occurred. This memory error can be particularly worrisome in judicial settings, in which witnesses may have false recollections of a crime after it has happened, especially when told by others that particular things may have happened which did not. Another area of concern regarding false memories is in cases of child abuse. Some people believe therapists plant false memories into patients, leading them to believe that they have experienced abuse in their childhood even though they did not.
Problem of bias.
The problem of bias, which is the distorting influences of present knowledge, beliefs, and feelings on recollection of previous experiences. Sometimes what people remember from their past says less about what actually happened than about what they personally believe, feel, and the knowledge they have acquired at the present time. An individuals current moods can bias their memory recall, researchers have found. There are three types of memory biases, "consistency bias", "change bias" and "egocentric bias". Consistency bias is the bias to reconstruct the past to fit the present. Change bias is the tendency to exaggerate differences between what we feel or believe in the present and what we previously felt or believed in the past. Egocentric bias is a form of "change bias", the tendency to exaggerate the change between the past and the present in order to make ourselves look good in any given situation.
Misinformation effect.
The misinformation effect refers to the change in memory due to the presentation of information that is relevant to the target memory, such as leading questions or suggestions. Memories are likely to be altered when questions are worded differently or when inaccurate information is presented. For example, in one experiment participants watched a video of an automobile accident and were then asked questions regarding the accident. When asked how fast the automobiles were driving when they "smashed" into each other, the speed estimate was higher than when asked how fast the automobiles were driving when they "hit", "bumped" or "collided" into each other. Similarly, participants were more likely to report there being shattered glass present when the word "smashed" was used instead of other verbs. Evidently, memory recollection can be altered with misleading information after the event.
Source confusion.
Source confusion or unconscious transference, involves the misattribution of the source of a memory. For instance, an individual may recall seeing an event in person when in reality they only witnessed the event on television. Ultimately, the individual has an inability to remember the source of information in which the content and the source become dissociated. This may be more likely for more distant memories, such as childhood memories. In more severe cases of source confusion, you can take fictional stories you heard from when you were younger and assimilated these stories being your childhood. For example, say your father told you stories about his life when he was a child every night before you went to sleep when you were a child. When you grow up, you might mistakenly remember these stories you dad told you as your own and integrate them into your childhood memories.
Imagination inflation.
Imagination inflation refers to when a person remembers details of a memory that are exaggerated versions of the actual event or remember an entire memory that never occurred due to the act of imagination. That is, when one imagines an event occurring, their confidence that this event actually did occur increases. One reason for this may be due to the act of imagination increasing the familiarity of the event. When the event seems more familiar, it may become more likely for people to report it actually occurring. For instance, in an experiment participants were asked to imagine playing inside and then running outside toward a window, falling and breaking it, while other participants did not imagine anything. Participants who had imagined this scenario reported an increased level of confidence that the event had actually happened in comparison to those who did not imagine the event. This error can be caused simply by imagining an event.
Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) paradigm.
Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm refers to the incorrect recall of features of an event that were not actually present, due to the features being related to a common theme. This paradigm has been demonstrated with the use of word lists and subsequent recognition tests. For example, experiments have shown that if a research participant is presented with the words: "bed rest awake tired dream wake snooze snore nap yawn drowsy", there is a high likelihood that the participant will falsely recall that the word "sleep" was in the list of words. These results show a significant illusion in memory, in which people remember items that were never presented simply due to their relation with other items in a common theme.
Schematic errors.
Schematic errors refer to the use of a schema to help reconstruct parts of an experience that cannot be remembered. This may include parts of the schema that did not actually take place, or aspects of a schema that are stereotypical of an event. Schemas can be described as mental guidelines (scripts) for events that are encountered in daily life. For example, when going to the gas station, there is a general pattern of how things will occur (i.e. turn car off, get out of car, open gas tank, punch the gas button, put nozzle into the tank, fill up the tank, put the nozzle back, close the tank, pay, turn car on, leave). Schemas make the world more predictable, allowing expectations to be formed of how things will enfold and to take note of things that happen out of context. However, schemas also allow for memory errors, in that if certain aspects of a scene or event are missing from memory, people may incorrectly remember having actually seen or experienced them due to the fact they are usually a regular aspect of the schema. For example, an individual may not remember paying the waiter, but may believe they have done so, as this is a regular step in the script of going to a restaurant. Similarly, a person may recall seeing a fridge in a picture of a kitchen, even if one was not actually depicted due to existing schemas which suggest that kitchens almost always contain a fridge.
Intrusion errors.
Intrusion errors refer to when information that is related to the theme of a certain memory, but was not actually a part of the original episode, become associated with the event. This makes it difficult to distinguish which elements are in fact part of the original memory. One idea regarding how intrusion errors work is due to a lack of recall inhibition, which allows irrelevant information to be brought to awareness while attempting to remember. Another possible explanation is that intrusion errors result from a lack of new context integration into a viable memory trace, or into an already existing memory trace that is related to the appropriate memory. More explanations involve the temporal aspect of recall, meaning that as the time difference between the study periods of different lists approaches zero, the amount of intrusions between the lists tends to increase, the semantic aspect, meaning that the list of target words may have induced a false recall of non-target words that happen to have a similar or same meaning as the targets, and the similarity aspect, for example subjects who were given list of letters to recall were likely to replace target vowels with non-target vowels. Intrusion errors can be divided into two categories. The first are known as extra-list errors, which occur when incorrect and non-related items are recalled, and were not part of the word study list. These types of intrusion errors often follow the DRM Paradigm effects, in which the incorrectly recalled items are often thematically related to the study list one is attempting to recall from. Another pattern for extra-list intrusions would be an acoustic similarity pattern, this pattern states that targets that have a similar sound to non-targets may be replaced with those non-targets in recall. One major type of extra-list intrusions is called the "Prior-List Intrusion" (PLI), a PLI occurs when targets from previously studied lists are recalled instead of the targets in the current list. PLIs often follow under the temporal aspect of intrusions in that since they were recalled recently they have a high chance of being recalled now. The second type of intrusion error is known as intra-list errors, which is similar to extra-list errors, except it refers to irrelevant recall for items that were on the word study list. Although these two categories of intrusion errors are based on word list studies in laboratories, the concepts can be extrapolated to real-life situations. Also, the same three factors that play a critical role in correct recall (recency, temporal association and semantic relatedness) play a role in intrusions as well. .
Time-slice errors.
Time-slice errors occur when a correct event is in fact recalled; however the event that was asked to be recalled is not the one that is recalled. In other words, the timing of events is incorrectly remembered. As discovered in a study by Brewer (1988), often the event or event details that are recalled occurred within a short time proximity to the memory required to be recalled. There are three possible theories as to why time-slice errors occur. First, they may be a form of interference, in which the memory information from one time impairs the recall of information from a different time. (see interference below). A second theory is that intrusion errors may be responsible, in that memories revolving around a similar time period thus share a common theme, and memories of various points of time within that larger time period become mixed with each other and intrude on each other's recall. Last, the recall of memories often have holes due to forgotten details. Thus, individuals may be using a script (see schema errors) to help fill in these holes with general knowledge of what they know happened around this time. Since scripts are a time-based knowledge structure, which puts details of a memory in sequence to make it easier to understand, time-slice errors can occur if a detail is mistakenly placed in the wrong sequence.
Personal life effects.
Personal life effects refer to the recall and belief in events as declared by family members or friends for having actually happened. Personal life effects are largely based on suggestive influences from external sources, such as family members or a therapist. Other influential sources may include media or literature stories which involve details that are believed to have been experienced or witnessed, such as a natural disaster close to where one resides, or a situation that is common and could have occurred, such as getting lost as a child. Personal life effects are most powerful when claimed to be true by a family member, and even more powerful when a secondary source confirms the event having happened. Personal life effects are believed to be a form of source confusion, in which the individual cannot recall where the memory is coming from Therefore, without being able to confirm the source of the memory, the individual may accept the false memory as true. Three factors may be responsible for the implantation of false autobiographical memories. The first factor is time. As time passes, memories fade. Therefore, source confusion may result due to time delay. The second factor is the imagination inflation effect. As the amount of imagination increases, so does one’s familiarity for the contents of the imagination. Thus, source confusion may also occur due to the individual confusing the source of the memory for being true, when in fact it was imaginary. Lastly, social pressure to recall the memory may affect the individual’s belief in the false memory. For example, with increase in pressure, the individual may lower their criteria for validating a memory, and come to accept a false memory for being true. Personal life effects can be extremely crucial to recognize in cases of recovered memories, especially those of abuse, in which the individual may have been led to believe they had been abused as a child by a therapist during psychological therapy, when in fact they had not been. Personal life effects can also be important in witness testimonies, in which suggestions from authorities may incorrectly implant memories regarding witnesses a particular detail about a crime (see the Childhood Abuse and Eye Witness Testimony sections below).
Memory error relating to food.
In a study done by J. Mojet and E.P. Köster, participants were asked to have a drink, yoghurt, and some biscuits for breakfast. A few hours later, they were asked to identify and the items they had during breakfast out of five variations of the drinks, yoghurts, and biscuits. The results showed that participants remember the texture of the foods much better than for fatty content, although they could discern the difference of both among the different items. Participants were also most certain about foods that they did not have during breakfast, but were the least certain about foods that they said were in their breakfast and about foods that were in their breakfast but were not recognized. This suggests that incidental and implicit memory for foods are more focused on discerning new and potentially unsafe food rather than remembering the details of familiar foods.
Causes.
Cognitive factors.
Spreading activation
One theory on how memory works is through a concept called spreading activation. Spreading activation refers to the firing of connected nodes in associated memory links. The theory states that memory is organized in a theoretical web of associated ideas and related features. Each feature, or node, is connected to related features or ideas, which in turn are themselves connected to other related nodes. The theory of spreading activation states that, when you think about a specific idea/object, that node becomes activated and fires, causing the connections of related features to also become activated, to a lesser degree. This theory explains the theory of retrieval cues, in which a cue that is related to a target memory is used to help remember a certain memory.
Spreading activation can also demonstrate how memory errors may occur. As the network of memory associations increases in the number of connections–the connection density–the likelihood of memory gaps and errors occurring also increases. Put simply, the amount of activation a secondary connection receives depends on how many connections the initial node has associated with it. This is because the initial node must divide the amount of activation it spreads to related nodes by the number of connecting nodes it is associated with. If node 1 has three connecting nodes, and node 2 has 15 connecting nodes, the three connecting nodes from node 1 will receive greater activation levels (the activation level is divided less) than for the 15 connecting nodes from node 2, and the components of these nodes will be more easily brought to mind. What this means is that, with more connections a node has, the more difficulty there is bringing to mind one of its connecting features. This can lead to memory errors, in that if the connection density is so great that there is not enough activation reaching the secondary nodes, then the person may not recall a target memory that is actually present, and a memory error occurs.
Activation levels to secondary nodes is also determined by the strength of the association to the primary node. Some connections have greater association with the primary node (e.g. fire truck and fire or red, versus fire truck and hose or Dalmatian), and thus will receive a greater portion of the divided activation than less associated connections. Thus, associations that receive less activation will be out-competed by associations with stronger connections, and may fail to be brought into awareness, again causing a memory error.
Connection density 
The connection densities, or neighbourhood densities of memory arrangements help distinguish which elements are a part of, or related to, the target memory. As the density of neural networks increases, the number of retrieval cues (associated nodes) also increases, which may allow for enhanced memory of the event. However, too many connections can inhibit memory in two ways. First, as described under the sub-section Spreading Activation, the total activation being spread from node 1 to connecting nodes is divided by the number of connections. With a greater number of connections, each connecting node receives less activation, which may result in too little activation for the memory cue to be brought to awareness. Connection strength, in which more strongly connected associations receive more activation than less-related associations, may also prevent specific connections from being brought to awareness due to being out-competed by the stronger associations. Second, with more connections branching from various other nodes, there is a greater probability of linking associated connections of different memories together (transplant errors) so that memory errors occur and incorrect features are recalled.
Retrieval cues
A retrieval cue is a type of hint that can be used to evoke a memory that has been stored but cannot be recalled. Retrieval cues work by selecting traces or associations in memory that contain specific content. With regards to the theory of spreading activation, retrieval cues use associated nodes to help activate a specific or target node. When no cues are available, recall is greatly reduced, leading to forgetting and possible memory errors. This is called retrieval failure, or cue-dependent forgetting.
Retrieval cues can be divided into two subsets, although they are by no means used independent of each other. The first are called feature cues, in which information of the content of the original memory, or related content, is used to aid recall. The second category is context cues, in which information based on the specific context (environment) in which the memory or learning occurred is used to aid recall.
Although retrieval cues are usually helpful in helping to remember something, they can produce memory errors in three ways. First, incorrect cues can be used, leading to recall of an incorrect memory. Second, although the correct retrieval cues may be used, they may still produce an incorrect memory. This is likely to occur with high connection densities, in which the incorrect (but associated) node was activated and thus recalled, instead of the target memory. Third, the retrieval cue chosen may be correct and associated with the target memory, but it may not have a strong connection to the target memory, and thus may not produce enough activation to produce the target memory.
Encoding specificity
Encoding specificity is when retrieval is successful to the extent that the retrieval cues used to help recall, match the cues the individual used during learning or encoding. Memory errors due to encoding specificity means that the memory is likely not forgotten, however, the specific cues used during encoding the primary event are now unavailable to help remember the event. The cues used during encoding are dependent on the environment of the individual at the time the memory occurred. In context-dependent memory, recall is based on the difference between the encoding and recall environments. Recall for items learned in a particular context is better when recall occurs in the same place as when the initial memory occurred. This is why it is sometimes useful to “return to the scene of the crime” to help witnesses remember details of a crime, or for explaining why going to a specific location such as a residence or community setting, may lead to becoming flooded with memories of things that happened in that context. Recall can also depend on state-dependency, or the conditions of one's internal environment, at both the time of the event and of recall. For example, if intoxicated at the time the memory actually occurred, recall for details of the event is greater when recalling while intoxicated. Associated with state-dependency, recall can also depend on mood-dependency, in which recall is greater when the mood for when the memory occurred matches the mood during recall. These specific dependencies are based on the fact that the cues used during the initial event can be specific to the context or state one was in. In other words, various features of the environment (both internal and external) can be used to help encode the memory, and thus become retrieval cues. However, if the context or state changes at the time of recall, these cues may no longer be available, and thus recall is hindered.
Transfer-appropriate processing
Memory errors can also depend on the method of encoding used when initially experiencing or learning information, known as transfer-appropriate processing. Encoding processes can occur at three levels: visual form (the letters that make up a word), phonology (the sound of a word), and semantics (the meaning of the word or sentence). With relation to memory errors, the level of processing at the time of encoding and at the time of recall should be the same. Although semantic processing generally produces greater recall that shallower levels of processing, a study by Morris et al. demonstrated that what might be the key factor to greater recall is transfer-appropriate processing–when the level of processing at the original memory/learning time matches the level of processing used to help recall. In other words, if learning occurred by rhyming the target words to other words, then recall is best if testing is also at the phonological level of processing, such as a rhyming recognition test. Thus, memory errors can occur when the levels of processing between encoding and recall do not match.
Interference
Interference occurs when specific information inhibits learning and /or recall for a specific memory. There are two forms of interference. First, proactive interference has to do with difficulty in learning new material based on the inability to override information from older memories. In such cases, retrieval cues continue to be associated and aimed at recalling previously learned information, affecting the recall of new material. Retroactive interference is the opposite of proactive interference, in which there is difficulty in the recall of previously learned information based on the interference of newly acquired information. In this case, retrieval cues are associated with the new information and not the older memory. thus affecting recall of older material. Interference of either form can produce memory errors, in which there is interference with the recall of material. In other words, previously used retrieval cues are no longer associated with prior memories, and thus memory confusion or even an inability to recall the memory can occur.
Physiological factors.
Brain damage
Neuroimaging studies have provided evidence for links between brain damage and memory errors. Brain areas implicated include the frontal lobe and medial-temporal regions of the brain. Such damage may result in significant confabulations and source confusion. 
The prefrontal cortex is in charge of making heuristic judgments and systematic judgments, which involve analyzing the qualities of memories and the retrieval and evaluation of supporting or disconfirming information. Thus, if the frontal region is damaged, these abilities will be impaired and memories may not be retrieved or evaluated correctly. For example, one patient who suffered frontal lobe damage after an automobile accident reported memories of the support his family provided for him after the accident, which in reality, was false.
The temporal region of the brain contains the hippocampus, which plays a significant role in memory. Thus, damage in this region may impair the function of this brain structure and result in memory problems.
Age
Studies have shown that the likelihood of memory errors occurring increases as age increases. Possible reasons for this are increased source confusion for the event and findings that older persons have decreased levels of processing when first presented with new information. Source confusion refers to the inability to distinguish how one came upon different information. Older individuals can become confused with where they learnt information (e.g. TV, radio, newspaper, word of mouth, etc.), who presented them with the information (e.g. which of two experimenters presented them with facts and which presented them with irrelevant information), and whether the information came from an imagined source, and is thus not factual, or a real world source. This in itself is a form of memory error but can also create larger memory errors. When an older individual is confused whether the information is factual or was imagined they can begin to accept imagined memories as real and thus begin to rely on new false information. Levels of processing refers to the manner in which someone encodes information into their memory and how deeply it is encoded. There are three different levels of processing ranging from shallow to deep, deep being stored in long-term memory for a longer period and thus better remembered. The three levels are; visual form, being the shallowest form, phonology, being a medium level of processing, and semantics (meaning), which is the deepest form of processing. The visual form of processing relies on the ability to see information and break it down into its components (e.g. see the word "dog", composed D, O, and G). Phonology relies on creating links to information through sound such as cues and tricks for memory (e.g. Dog rhymes with Fog). Finally, semantics refer to the creation of meaning behind information such as adding detail to allow the information to create links throughout our memory with other memories and thus be held in long-term memory for a longer period (e.g. A dog is a four-legged pet that often chases cats and chews on bones). Older individuals often begin to lose the quick ability to add meaning to new information, which leads to shallower processing and easier forgetting of the information gained. Both of these possible factors can decrease the validity of the memory due to retrieval for details of the event being more difficult to perform. This leads to details of memories being confused with others or lost completely, which lead to many errors in recall of a memory.
Emotion
The emotional impact of an event can have a direct impact on how the memory is first encoded, how it is later recalled, and what details of the event are accurately recalled. Highly emotional events tend to be recalled easily due to their emotional impact, as well as their distinctiveness relative to other memories (highly emotional events do not occur on a regular basis, and thus are easily separated from other events that are more commonly met). Emotional events may affect memory not only because of their distinctiveness, but also because of their arousal on the individual. Studies have found that prime or central features of such highly emotional events tend to be accurately recalled, whereas subtle details of the events are not remembered, or are remembered with vague consistency. Memory errors related to highly emotional events are influenced in ways such as:
• Whether the event was positive or negative in nature - The nature of the event can affect memory, negative events tend to be remembered with greater accuracy than positive events.
• Implicit theories of consistency and change - This term was coined by Ross (1989), and is used to describe the phenomena of memory change based on the belief of how the person felt at the time of the event compared to their current feelings about it. In other words, the memory of one's emotion towards an event can change depending on their current emotional state toward the same event. If a person believes their feelings at both times continue to be the same, then the current emotion to "remember" how they felt about the event at a previous time is used. If feelings are believed to have changed, then recall of the emotional involvement in the past event is adjusted to the current feelings.
• Intrusion errors - This term refers to the inclusion of details that may have been commonly experienced in the event, but not by the individual. For example, in the September 11 terrorist attacks, many people may state that they remember hearing about the attacks on the television news, as this was a common way of finding out this information, whereas they may have actually heard about it from a neighbour or on the radio.
• Mood-congruency - Items/events are better recalled when the mood of the individual at the time of the event and the time of recall are the same. Thus, if the mood at the time of recall does not match the mood experienced at the time the event occurred, there is an increased chance that complete recall will be affected/interrupted.
Memory errors in Abnormal Psychology.
Abnormal psychology is the branch of psychology that studies unusual patterns of behavior, emotion and thought, which may or may not be understood as a mental disorder. Memory errors can commonly be found in types of abnormal psychology such as Alzheimer's Disease, depression and schizophrenia.
Alzheimer's Disease.
Alzheimer’s Disease is characterized by progressive memory impairment and decline, usually beginning short-term memory. As it is a progressive disease, Alzheimer’s usually begins with memory errors before proceeding to long-term memory stores. One form of memory error occurs in contrast to the theory of retrieval cues in being a reason for the occurrence of memory errors. As noted above, memory errors may be due to the lack of cues that can trigger a memory trace and bring it to awareness. However, studies have shown that the opposite may be true for patients with Alzheimer’s, such that cues may actually decrease perform on
priming tasks. Patients also demonstrate errors known as misattribution errors, otherwise known as source confusion. However, studies show that these misattribution errors are dependent on whether the task is a familiarity or recollection tas. Although patients tend to exhibit a higher level of false recognitions than control groups. researchers have shown that they may exhibit less false-recognition early in the test due to familiarity being slower to develop. However, the observation of increasing instances of misattribution errors can be seen once familiarity does occur. This may be related to the retrieval cue speculation, in that familiar memories often contain cues we know, and thus may be the reason why familiarity can contribute to memory errors. Lastly, many studies have shown that Alzheimer’s patients commonly suffer from intrusion errors. Relative to the findings that retrieval cues may actually hurt recall performance, one study by Kramer et al. showed that intrusions are most commonly associated with cue-recall tasks. This study suggests that cues may lead to intrusions because patients may have a difficult time distinguishing between cues and distractions, which may help explain why cues increase memory errors in patients with Alzheimer’s. Since verbal intrusions are a common aspect of Alzheimer’s. some researchers believe that this characteristic may be helpful in the diagnosis of the disease.
Depression.
Memory errors can occur in patients with depression or with depressive symptoms. Patients with depressive symptoms have a tendency to experience what is known as the negative triad, which is the perspective use of negative schemas and self-concepts to relate to the external world. Due to this negative triad, depressive patients have a tendency to have a much greater focus on, and recall for, negative details and events over positive ones. This may lead to memory errors related to the positive details of memories, impairing the accuracy or even complete recall of such memories. Depressed patients also experience deficits in psychomotor speed and in free recall of material both immediate and delayed. This suggests that material has been encoded but that patients are particularly impaired with regard to search and retrieval processes. Diverse aspects of memory such as short-term memory, long-term memory, semantic memory and implicit memory, have been studied and linked to depression. Short-term memory, a temporary store for newly acquired information, seems to show no major impairments in the case of depressive patients who do seem to complain about poor concentration, which by itself can cause simple memory errors. Long-term memory, large capacity able to retain information over long periods of time, does however show impairment in the case of depressed individuals. They tend to have difficulties in recall and recognition for both verbal and visuo-spatial material with intervals of a few minutes or even hours creating complex memory errors in relation to speech and surrounding details. Individuals suffering with depression also showed a specific deficit in retrieving information meaningfully organized in their semantic memory, conceptual knowledge about the real world. Therefore, depressive patients can show memory errors for the most meaningful events in their lives, unable to recall these specific moments vividly like someone not suffering from depression might. In the case of implicit memory, when previous information influences ongoing responses, there has been little to no proof of a deficit in relations to depressed individuals.
Schizophrenia.
Memory errors, specifically intrusion errors and imagination inflation effects, have been found to occur in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Intrusion errors can commonly be found in the recall portion of a memory test when a participant includes items that were not on the original list that was presented. These types of errors are linked to problems with self-monitoring, increased positive and disorganized symptoms (confusion within the brain), and poor executive functioning. Intrusion errors are found to be more likely in patients with positive schizophrenic symptoms, which involve an excess of normal bodily functions (e.g. delusions), versus negative schizophrenic symptoms, which involve a decrease in normal bodily functions (e.g. refusal to speak). Possible reasons for this are reduced function in the central executive of the working memory, as well as defects in self-reflectivity, organization and reasoning. Self-reflectivity is the ability to recognize and reason about one’s own thought process, recognize that one has thoughts, and that those thoughts are one’s own and differentiate between cognitive operations. Self-reflectivity has been shown to be one of the biggest deficits faced by schizophrenics and data suggests that verbal memory intrusions are linked to deficits in the ability to identify, organize, and reason about one's own thoughts in patients with schizophrenia.
Imagination inflation effects were also common memory errors in patients with schizophrenia. This effect refers to events that individuals have imagined so vividly in their minds that this adds belief to the fact that the event truly occurred, although it did not. Possible reasons for this are increased source confusion and/or decreased source recollection of an event, which shows poor use of source-monitoring processes. Source-monitoring processes allow one to distinguish between a memory that we may believe has happened because it seems familiar and one that has truly occurred. In the case of schizophrenics, whose abilities to reason through their thoughts is impaired, something that they have imagined and thus, seems familiar can easily be mistaken for an actual event, especially in the case of quick heuristic processes and snap judgments. Continuously imagining an action or event makes this action more and more familiar thus making it harder for a patient with schizophrenia to distinguish its source, questioning whether it is familiar because they have imagined it or if it is familiar because it happened. This leads to many memory errors for these individuals who are led to believe by their imagination of the event that it is real, has occurred and thus is stored in their memory for that reason.
Consequences of memory errors.
Memory errors often lead to the belief of new memories, which are problematic. In the case of eyewitness testimony new false memories can often lead to wrong information and lack of conviction or wrongful conviction of individuals. Also in the case of child abuse, memory errors can lead to the creation of false traumatic childhood memories, which can lead to false accusations and loss of trust.
Eyewitness testimony.
Memory errors can occur in eyewitness testimonies due to a number of features commonly present in a trial, all of which may influence the authenticity of the memory, and may be detrimental to the outcome of the case at hand. 
Such features include:
• Leading questions – refers to how wording of questions can influence how an event is remembered. This can result from a misinformation effect or an imagination inflation effect. The misinformation effect occurs when information is presented after the events in question have occurred which leads to memory errors in later retrieval. Studies have suggested that witnesses may misattribute accuracy to misleading information because the sources of misleading information and witnessed information become confused. Misleading information can be acquired through reading of the newspaper, watching the news, being interviewed or when sitting in the courthouse during the trial. When witnesses are asked to recall specific details of an event they can begin to doubt their memory, which can cause memory errors. Misinformation can manifest itself as a memory leading the individual to believe it as true and witnesses may also begin to doubt their own memories of the event deciding instead that they must be wrong. Memory errors also occur through the imagination inflation effect. As stated earlier, the imagination inflation effect takes place when an individual imagines an event to the point where it is believed as a memory of an actual event. During trial, witnesses hear many different possible occurrences of events and are led to imagine these situations. Through imagining and rehearsal of the occurrences, witnesses may begin to see vividness and validity in the stories simply from rehearsal, not factual memories. This can create problems for witnesses when trying to distinguish between imagined events and the actual occurrence of the events. Small but largely significant details become easily mixed and these occurrences of memory errors can make or break a trial.
• Weapons Focus Effect–refers to the fact that witnesses are highly likely to pay close attention to the weapon being used during an event, which creates a reduction in the ability to remember other details regarding the crime. This can in turn create memory errors leaving the witness less able to remember details such as what the assailant was wearing or what distinctive features could be found on their body or face. One explanation for why witnesses tend to gravitate toward the weapon being used is said to be that the arousal of the witness is increased. When arousal becomes increased the number of perceptional cues being utilized by the brain decreases. This allows the individual to focus on the weapon cue and ignore other cues such as distinct scars or a bright red shirt. The weapons focus effect can also refer to how the report of the use of weapons in the case can influence the memory of the event, leading to a false memory of having heard a weapon being fired even if the witness did not. For example, if a newspaper reports that the victim was beaten with a hammer, upon reading this, the witness will begin to believe that a hammer was in fact used, even if they at no point saw a hammer. This can cause many memory errors and conflict of stories for witnesses. As a society we believe that newspapers or televised news reports have fact behind them. If they report the hammer being used, a witness might begin to second-guess their memory wondering if they missed the hammer or failed to remember that detail. Also, their story may become mixed with the media's representation of the story and the knife that they did see will be forgotten and instead be replaced with the hammer that was reported.
• Familiarity Effect–refers to the tendency of individuals to develop a preference for things simply because they are familiar. This can leave an individual to identify familiar people as guilty, even if they are not. When we are continuously exposed to the same object or person we begin to develop a positive attraction towards said object or person. Simply their familiarity creates a positive sense when re-exposed to the individual or object. In reality one can know very little about a person but by seeing them over and over again can gain unconscious positive recall for their face. This can create memory errors when individuals are asked to identify a criminal and someone familiar to them is placed in the line up. When a familiar face is in among the individuals that the witness is being asked to study, the witness will find himself or herself gravitating towards the familiar face whether or not this is who they witnessed committing the crime. This leaves them more likely to ignore the cues that are leading them towards other individuals and concentrate on the familiar face, resulting in a false accusation. The sense of familiarity can play a large role in the identification of criminals but when the familiarity of a criminal is mixed in with the familiarity of other individuals, choosing the right person can become quite difficult.
Child abuse.
Memory errors regarding the recovery of repressed childhood abuse can occur due to post-event suggestions from a trusted source, such as a family member, or more commonly, a mental health professional. Due to possible relationships between childhood abuse and mental illness later in life, some mental health professionals believe in the Freudian theory of repressed memories as a defense mechanism for the anxiety that recall of the abuse would cause. Freud said that repression operates unconsciously in individuals who are not able to recall a threatening situation or may even forget that the abusive individual was ever part of their lives. Therefore, mental health professionals will sometimes seek to uncover possible instances of childhood abuse in patients, which may lead to suggestibility and cause a false memory of childhood abuse to arise, in an attempt to seek a cause to a mental illness No matter the confidence in the memory, this does not necessarily equate to the memory being true. This is an example of the misinformation effect and false memory effect. The fact that memories are not retrieved as whole entities but rather are reconstructed from information remaining in memory and other related knowledge make them easily susceptible to memory errors. This explains why working with mental health professionals and leading questions can sometimes manifest false memories by creating knowledge of possible events and asking individuals to focus on if these events actually took place Individuals begin to overthink these situations visualizing them in their mind and overanalyzing them. This in turn leads to the belief of situations and vivid memories. Patients are left with memories they believe are real and new events from their childhood which can lead to stress and trauma in their adult life and loss of relationships with those who are believed to be the abuser.

The Truth (1998 film)

The Truth is a 1998 Malayalam investigative thriller film written by S. N. Swamy and directed by Shaji Kailas. Mammootty plays the lead role of the investigating officer in the film.The film was an excellent thriller and was a super hit at the box office. The film had a successful Tamil dubbed release as Unmai.
Plot.
The film begins with some insight into a Brahmin family, with Patteri Thilakan as the patriarch, who is a great astrologer and helps a policeman (Janardhanan) crack a robbery case. The story then moves on to a political arena, where Balachandra Menon is presiding as the Chief Minister and battling against ministers among his own party who are keen to oust him in the next elections. During a chance encounter with Patteri (Thilakan), Patteri predicts the by-elections won't happen.
Meanwhile, a mysterious and alluring woman is seen entering a flat where she meets an accomplice and they go through the details of an assassination which they plan to carry out very soon.The plan is successful and the Chief Minister is killed along with a few other officers. The initial investigations are headed by Vani Vishwanath who, aided by a camera found on the spot (presumably the killer woman's who sneaked in the avenue using a journalist pass) she manages to track down the flat where the woman stayed for a few days. They arrest the home owner (Babu Namboodiri) but are unable to go further as there is no sign of the woman anywhere nor has any one seen her. The judge hearing the case is unhappy that an innocent man (Babu Namboodiri) has to face the tribulations for no fault of his orders Vani Vishwanath off the case and orders the Special Investigation Team (SIT) to take over.
The SIT arrives from Delhi and is headed by Mammootty, who also happens to be Patteri's son. In the beginning there is friction between Mammootty and Vani Vishwanath but later she helps him in the investigation. Further investigations go on, complicating the case. Later it turns out that the woman they were searching for is really a man. On reaching his hideout, Bharat (Mammooty), finds him dead. In the ending, Bharath reveals the shocking identity of the mastermind who had plotted the entire assassination, DGP Hariprasad (Murali). He had masterminded the plot for money as he was the one who had been pumping illicit weapons into the state for the terrorists. In the end, Hariprasad is arrested by his own department officers and sent to jail. Bharat and his team return to Delhi.

Bath College of Domestic Science

Bath College of Domestic Science was a small college in Bath, Somerset, England.
The teaching of domestic subjects in Bath started in 1892 at 19 Green Park with the founding of the Bath Technical Schools. The Technical Instruction Act of 1889 had given local authorities power to levy a rate to provide such education. In this building instruction also started in subjects including cabinet making, carpentry, joinery, masonry, mathematics and French. The prospectus for domestic subjects offered "Household and High-Class Cookery, Laundry Work, Dressmaking, Stitchery and Ornamental Needlework".
In 1960 a local newspaper published a history of the college which stated:
A photograph of the first group of students and another of Miss Lawrie were published in a commemorative brochure by Bath Spa University. In April 1896 the temporary homes of the various Technical Schools were united in the new north extension of the Guildhall. Miss Lawrie was succeeded as Headmistress by Miss A M Heygate in 1907, and in 1915 by Miss W M King who remained until 1945. In 1910 the main part of the domestic science teaching was moved to numbers 2 and 3, Long Acre, Bath. By the end of the First World War there were forty resident students. In 1920 the name Training College for Teachers of Domestic Subjects was adopted. In its early days the College's students had a uniform of a bright red blouse, black full-length skirt and white apron, and they were nicknamed "the scarlet runners".
In 1934 the Domestic Science College moved to a building in Brougham Hayes which had been built as the Somerset Industrial School for Boys in 1832. In the emergency of wartime in 1939 this building was taken over by the Admiralty and the College moved to The Elms, a large house in the Weston area of the city, returning to Brougham Hayes in 1944. In 1942 German bombing destroyed the original premises at Green Park but also flattened a large private house called St Winifreds at Sion Hill which was to become its future home. A hostel for students opened in the 1950s in Somerset Place. The first overseas student arrived from Nigeria in 1946 and in the following years many Commonwealth countries were represented in the student body. A course in Institutional Management began in 1946. 
Planning for a new building at Sion Hill began after the war and the new Domestic Science College 
The formal opening of the new premises by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother took place on March 23, 1960 and a history appeared in a special supplement in the local newspaper to mark both this and the renovation of Bath Abbey. The "Chronicle" feature notes that some of the stones from the ruined premises of St Winifred's were incorporated in the new structure. A change of name to Bath College of Education (Home Economics) took place in 1964/65. The final Principal of the independent College was Miss Eileen Phillips. Validation of courses was by the University of Bristol. In 1975 the College was merged with Newton Park College to create Bath College of Higher Education, later Bath Spa University College and Bath Spa University. Bachelors degrees in Home Economics and in Secondary teaching were subsequently awarded by the University of Bath and later by the Council for National Academic Awards. In 1985/86 the food-based courses were moved to new premises at Newton Park allowing the Sion Hill building to be used for the courses of the Bath School of Art and Design returning to Bath from Corsham Court. Further degree course developments included BSc Honours courses in Human Ecology, Food Management, Human Nutrition and in Food, Nutrition and Consumer Protection, with the University finally receiving the authority to award its own degrees.

Croydon Rugby Football Club, founded in 1956 as Shirley Wanderers RFC, and are based at Addington Road, West Wickham, in the London Borough of Croydon, South London.
Croydon are currently playing in the Rugby Football Union Surrey 2 league, and the RFU Junior Vase.
Club History.
Formed as Shirley Wanderers RFC in 1956, by a mixture of experienced players and those who were new to the game. After 7 years as a wandering size the club opened a clubhouse on the present site and leased 3 pitches, of which 2 remain.
In 2003, Croydon RFC welcomed the players of Old Croydonian RFC after the club lost its supply on youth players, and then had to rely on players relocating to the area for employment and from non-playing rugby schools, and therefore started having troubles fielding a side, leading to the renaming of the club as Croydon RFC.
Croydon currently field 3 senior sides, and 2 junior sides, with all sides competing in rugby leagues.

The First Japan Arena Tour is the first Japanese concert tour by South Korean girl group Girls' Generation to promote their 2011 self-titled album in Japanese.
History.
It was announced on March 7, 2011 that Girls' Generation would embark on their first nationwide Japan tour on May 18, 2011 at Yoyogi National Stadium in Tokyo, with a total of seven stops in Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka and Fukuoka. The start of the tour was postponed to May 31, 2011 because of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Due to overwhelming demand with up to 300,000 applicants applying for tickets, additional stops were added to the tour.
The tour covered Osaka, Saitama, Tokyo, Hiroshima, Nagoya, and Fukuoka with total of fourteen performances. The tour attracted 140,000 fans overall. It was also revealed that the estimated revenue collected from the tour could reach 20 billion Won.
Media coverage.
Various Japanese media, including Mezamashi TV, covered the start of their concert with detailed reports. NHK's Music Japan presented a Girls' Generation special, detailing their meteoric rise in Korea and subsequent debut in Japan, with an interview session interspersed with footage from the Osaka stop of the First Japan Arena Tour. Girls' Generation First Japan Arena Tour in 3D was be broadcast on Japan's SkyPerfectTv on the 21st of August.

Andrés never learns of these events. He marries his old girlfriend, Lucrecia, who is pregnant with what he believes to be his child. In reality, the baby is the product of a one-night-stand Lucrecia had. Alma spends the next 20 years in prison thinking Andrés didn't care to help her, meanwhile Andrés thinks she preferred to stay with her husband. 
When Alma gets out of prison, she is determined to find her daughter. She is courted by Gonzalo Molina, a much older rich ranch owner, who has always liked her.

Goodliffe's Abracadabra

Abracadabra was a British weekly magic magazine whose publication life spanned sixty-three years. The first issue was published on 2 February 1946; the last issue was published on the 28th of March 2009; a total of 3,296 issues.
The Name of the Magazine.
Although the magazine name was "Abracadabra", it was also known as "Goodliffe’s Abracadabra" and the readers nicknamed the magazine "Abra".
Origins.
The weekly magazine, "Abracadabra", was created by Charles Goodliffe Neale (1912 - December 26, 1980). He was a magician and author. From the very first issue, Goodliffe (as he preferred to be called) gave the magazine the cover tag line of "Abracadabra" being “The Only Magical Weekly in the World.”
Goodliffe was a man of strong views and the magazine became the arena of many controversial debates about magic and magicians, sometimes initiated by the readers themselves through their contributions and letters.
After Goodliffe’s Death.
After Goodliffe’s death "Davenports" (one of London’s oldest family run magic shops) and Rabbi Sam Gringras ("Magico" of New York) put together a rescue package and the magazine continued its publication uninterrupted.
The Editors.
All the editors have been professional magicians.
Originally, Goodliffe himself was the principal editor with the help of associate editor Fabian (Ernest Raymond Griffiths, b.1912-d.1965).
The next editor, who continued as editor after Goodliffe's death and kept "Abracadabra" running, was Donald Bevan. 
The final editor was Walt Lees.
The Contributors.
Over the decades the magazine not only included articles from its regular readers but also from television magicians such as David Nixon, Wayne Dobson, Paul Daniels and Jerry Sadowitz. In its later years, contributions came from authors such as Paul Gordon and John Helvin. The contents of the magazine was news, reviews, magic tricks and articles on magic as a performing art and its history; the quality of the content varied over the years.
The Demise of Abracadabra.
In issue 3295, on March 21 of 2009, the Davenport family announced that "Abracadabra" was to change owners. The new owner would be a “magical enthusiast” named Stephen Martin. However, for undisclosed reasons, the deal fell through and the next issue of "Abracadabra" announced its closure as a publication. In his final editorial Walt Lees wrote “…when I took over the job, it was made clear to me that "Abra" was struggling. Times were changing and with the growth of so much internet traffic, the demand for a hardcopy weekly was falling off dramatically.” Lees was initially given a year to salvage the magazine, which became two years. Lees wrote “… I did my best. Sadly my best wasn’t good enough.”. For some, this statement made it appear that Lees was taking the blame for the magazine’s demise and articles were written in his defence by people, such as John Helvin. and Al Smith, which highlighted contributing factors to the magazine’s demise which were beyond Walt Lees’ control.

Rupert Mills

Rupert Frank Mills (October 12, 1892 – July 20, 1929) was a professional baseball player. He played part of one season in Major League Baseball for the 1915 Newark Peppers of the now-defunct Federal League, primarily as a first baseman. He batted .201 in 41 games for the Peppers.
Born in Newark, New Jersey, Mills attended Barringer High School and the University of Notre Dame, where he studied law. At Notre Dame he starred in football, baseball, basketball and track.
Mills was the only native-born Jerseyan on the Peppers' squad. Thanks to his law education, he signed an "ironclad" two-year contract with the Peppers. Though the team disbanded after the 1915 season, Mills "played" the non-existent 1916 "season." A clause in his 1915 contract guaranteed him a salary the following year as long as he continued to show up at the park, suited and ready to play for the team. Mills fulfilled his contractual obligations, coming to the empty park each day at 9 a.m., donning his uniform, and performing a rigorous physical workout to remain in playing condition. Partway through the summer, former team co-owner Patrick Powers bought out the balance of Mills' contract, after which Mills signed with a minor league club in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania that was affiliated with the Detroit Tigers. He batted .256 in 70 games. 
In 1917 he played with the Denver Bears of the Western League, leading the league in games played (149), doubles (37), assists (75) and fielding percentage (.987).
In 1918 he enlisted in the U.S. military and during World War I served in France as lieutenant with the 11th field artillery division. Upon military discharge, he entered local politics and served as Undersheriff of Essex County, New Jersey.
On July 20, 1929, Mills was canoeing with former New Jersey state assemblyman Louis Freeman on Lake Hopatcong, when the boat capsized. Freeman could not swim, but Mills rescued him. While passing Freeman's unconscious body to people on shore, Mills suffered a heart attack and drowned. At the time of his death, he was campaigning as the Republican candidate for Sheriff of Essex County.

Harald Schultz-Hencke

Harald Schultz-Hencke (18 August 1892, Berlin – 23 May 1953, Berlin) was a German psychiatrist and psychotherapist. After an initial introduction to psychoanalysis, with Sandor Rado as psychoanalyst, he was excluded from the German Society of Psychoanalysis because of, among other things, his divergent views on sexuality.
In 1933, like several non-Jewish psychotherapists (Felix Boehm, Carl Mueller-Braunschweig and Werner Kemper) he helped set up the "Goering Institute" (Matthias Göring), which was closely linked to the Nazi regime and promoted a “New German soul medicine,” a psychotherapy for the Germanborn. After the war, his participation in this institute created controversy in professional circles such as the International Psychoanalytical Association.
With other psychotherapists and analysts who had left or had been excluded from other psychoanalytic organizations, he started the DPV ("Deutsche Psychoanalytische Vereinigung"). After numerous debates regarding whether or not these analysts should join the International Psychoanalytical Association, Schultz-Hencke, who had long been in disagreement with the basic tenets of Freudian theory, created “Neopsychanalyse.”
“Neopsychanalyse” or neopsychoanalysis is a psychotherapeutic technique thus named by Harald Schultz-Hencke.
In one of his books, Dr. Schultz-Hencke had asserted that all psychotherapy should be submitted to the Leibnizian principle that "all science must be expressed in mathematical terms.” This implies that even a young science must strive towards this goal. In this perspective, Schultz-Hencke analyzed all Freudian concepts and eliminated all those that do not respond to this precept, or that, according to him, could never respond to it, such as infantile sexuality, etc. 
So, in a way, the dualistic view of Freudian psychoanalysis is challenged in favor of a monistic view (and thus do not include notions of conflict between psychic entities, etc..). Schultz-Hencke also wanted to subject the concept named Oedipus complex to statistical studies. To some extent, this criticism joined that of Karl Popper and other more modern scientists who, before anything else, advocated quantitative analysis and, thus, statistics.
The treatment technique advocated by Schultz-Hencke was subsequently developed by Helmut Bach, among others, who progressively demarcated the ideas of its founder to create a "psychoanalysis" within the limits of practices imposed by the IPA; psychotherapists such as Franz Alexander, Karen Horney, René Laforgue and Erich Fromm have contributed significantly to this endeavor.

2011 Sidecarcross World Championship

The 2011 FIM Sidecarcross World Championship, the 32nd edition of the competition, started on 3 April and finished after thirteen race weekends on 11 September 2011.
The defending champions were eight time winners Daniël Willemsen from the Netherlands and his passenger Gertie Eggink. In 2011, Willemsen raced with 43-year old Sven Verbrugge as his passenger, after an injury to first-choice passenger Roman Vasyliaka. Willemsen and Verbrugge were a team for a fifth time in the history of the competition, with the combination winning the 2005 and 2006 titles together. Willemsen temporarily switched to Ondrej Cermak as his passenger for the first of two German GP's because of an injury to Verbrugge. Willemsen and his passenger clinched the World Championship at the second-last race of the season, at Slagelse, Denmark, having a 53 point lead over Latvians Janis and Lauris Daiders. The Belgian-Latvian combination Joris Hendrickx-Kaspars Liepins, the 2009 World Champions and long the main rivals of Willemsen-Verbrugge during the 2011 season, suffered a season-ending injury at the qualifying of the German Grand Prix in July 2011, being able to compete in the race but requiring surgery afterwards. 
Parallel to the riders competition, a manufacturers championship was also held. Like in 2010, the competition was a close contest between 2010 champions WSP and eventual winners VMC.
The Sidecarcross World Championship, first held in 1980 and organised by the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme, is an annual competition. All races, manufacturers and the vast majority of riders in the competition being in and from Europe. Sidecarcross is similar to motocross except that the teams consist of two riders, a driver and a passenger. Races are held on the same tracks as solo motocross but the handling of the machines differs as sidecars don't lean. The majority of physical work in the sport is carried out by the passenger, who speeds up the sidecarcross in corners by leaning out. The coordination between the driver and the passenger are therefore of highest importance.
Overview.
The thirteen races of the season were held in eleven countries, Netherlands, Switzerland, France, Poland, Ukraine, Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Russia and Denmark. In comparison to the 2010 edition, the Grand Prix of Great Britain and Italy have been dropped off the calendar while the Swiss GP made a return.
Format.
Every Grand Prix weekend is split into two races, both held on the same day. This means, the 2011 season with its thirteen Grand Prix has 26 races. Each race lasts for 30 minutes plus two laps. The two races on a weekend actually get combined to determined an overall winner. In case of a tie, the results of the second race as used to determined the winner. While this overall winners receives no extra WC points, they usually are awarded a special trophy. Race start times are set at 13:30 and 16:00.
Events typically consist of a qualifying competition, held in multiple stages on Saturdays of a race weekend while the two race events are typically held on Sundays. One exception to this rule is Easter weekends, when the races are held on Easter Monday. Race weekends can consist of additional motocross or quart support races as well, but the FIM stipulates that the World Championship races have priority. Riders have to be provided with at least one 30 minute free practice season, which will be timed. A race can consist of up to 30 starters and the qualifying modus is dependend on the number of entries. Up to 32 entries, it will be held in one group split into two sesions of 30 minutes each. Above 32 entries, the starter field will be sub-divided into two groups through ballot and the current standings. Each qualifying group can consist of up to 30 racers. Should there be more than 60 entries, a pre-qualifying has to be held. Of the riders in the two groups, the top-twelve directly qualify for the races. The remaining teams then go to a second-chance qualifying, in which the best six advance. The riders placed seventh and eighth remain in reserve should one of the qualified teams not be able to participate.
The FIM stipulates that all drivers must be of a minimum age of 18 while passengers have to be at least 16 years old to compete, but no older than 50. Riders older than 50 have to provide a certificate of medical fitness to be permitted to compete. The driver has the right to exchange his passenger under certain conditions.
Starting numbers for the season are awarded according to the previous seasons overall finishing position of the driver. Current or former World Champions have however the right to pick any number they wish, except the number one which is reserved for the current World Champion.
The competition is open for motor cycles with two-stroke engines from between 350 and 750cc and four-stroke engines of up to 1,000cc. Each team is permitted the use of two motorcycles with the possibility of changing machines between races.
The FIM does not permit radio communication between riders and their teams. Outside assistance during the race on the course is not permitted unless it is through race marshals in the interest of safety. Limited repairs in the designated repair zone during the race are permitted.
The first twenty teams of each race score competition points. The point system for the season was as follows:
Prize money.
In 2011, prize money was awarded to all rider scoring points, with €300 going to each race winner, €250 to the runners-up, gradually declining from there, with €50 going to all teams placed 12th to 20th. Additionally, every team qualified for the race plus the two reserve teams receive €500 in travel compensation.

Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Pondicherry

Immaculate Conception Cathedral is the cathedral mother church for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Pondicherry and Cuddalore. It is located in the Union territory of Puducherry. It is also known as "Samba Kovil" (), which is a phonetic corruption of "Saint Paul’s Kovil" where "Kovil" means church.
History.
The Jesuit Fathers came to the French colony of Pondicherry as missionaries in 1689. There they bought a very large garden to the west of the French Fort. In the 1692 they, with the financial help of Louis XIV, king of France, erected a church which was demolished by the Dutch in the following year. A second Church was quickly built in 1699 but could not last long.
From 1728 to 1736 a large church was built on the site of the present Cathedral. This third church was razed to the ground by the British in 1761 during the Seven Years' War.
Erecting in 1765 provisionally (fourth in serial) a functional kind of irregular shaped shed where the Mission Press (official press depot of the archdiocese) is now, since the year 1770 the Fathers were earnest in building the present cathedral on the foundations of the 3rd Church. On 20 June 1791 the main work was finished and the Church was consecrated by Bishop Champenois. The Bell tower was built later. The choir loft was added in 1905. The Sanctuary was remodeled in the year 1970. The esplanade in front of the Cathedral was remodeled in 1987, to allow people to take part in liturgical ceremonies and special functions held outside.
The Fest of this Church i.e., Immaculate Conception of Blessed Virgin Mary falls on the 8th of December. Now The church which stands for around 300 years is also the place where the bishop house is also situated. Mass services in Tamil and English are conducted.
It is one of the oldest tourist sites in Puducherry., and was visited by Mother Teresa during her visit to Puducherry.

St Mary's Church, Bungay

St Mary's Church, Bungay, is a redundant Anglican church in the town of Bungay, Suffolk, England. The church and the ruins of the adjacent priory are designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building, and are under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands in the centre of the town on St Mary's Street, the A144 road.
History.
St Mary's was built as the church to a Benedictine priory. This was established in the late 12th century, but the main part of the present church dates from the 14th–15th century. The Domesday Survey records a church dedicated to the Holy Cross in the town, and it is thought that St Mary's stands on the site of an earlier Saxon church. The priory was closed in 1536 as a result of the dissolution of the monasteries, St Mary's became a parish church, and a grammar school was established in one of the priory's chapels. In 1577 the church was struck by lightning, and this event led to the "Legend of the Black Dog" (see below).
The church was damaged in a great fire in the town in 1688. The roof of the south aisle and some of the fittings, including benches and possibly the pulpit, were burnt, but the roof of the nave was not damaged. The south aisle was re-roofed in 1699, and the church re-opened in 1701. In 1879 the tower was repaired, and the rest of the church was restored, at a cost of £3,000 (£ as of ). During the 20th century the size of the congregation declined and the church was declared redundant. Its benefice has been united with that of Holy Trinity Church. A society, The Friends of St Mary's, cleans the church and organises concerts and other events in the church.
Architecture.
Exterior.
The church is constructed in flint and stone in Perpendicular style. Its plan consists of a nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, and a tower. The tower stands at the west end of the south aisle, and it is surmounted by four tall crocketted pinnacles. There is no chancel. The tower is high. There are ruined remains of the priory in the churchyard to the east of the church.
Interior.
The arcades are supported on five columns consisting of clustered shafts. The west window is particularly large, and has complicated tracery in its upper part. The bosses in the roof are carved with a variety of objects, including angels, a lion, two-headed eagles, and a bat. Near the entrance to the church is a dole cupboard, carved with a rat. Bread was placed in the dole cupboard to be given to the poor. Part of the church has been converted into a War Memorial Chapel. This contains a 17th-century Flemish panel depicting the Resurrection that was given to the church by the author H. Rider Haggard. The two-manual organ was made by E. W. Norman, and was moved to the church from Rose Hall, Bungay. It was rebuilt in 1961 by Walker. There is a ring of eight bells, all cast in 1820 by Thomas Mears II of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry.
Legend of the Black Dog.
The church was struck by lightning on Sunday, 4 August 1577. During the thunderstorm an apparition appeared, consisting of a black Hell Hound which dashed around the church, attacking members of the congregation. It then suddenly disappeared and re-appeared in Holy Trinity Church, Blythburgh away, injuring members of the congregation there. The dog has been associated with Black Shuck, a dog haunting the coasts of Norfolk, Essex and Suffolk. An image of the Black Dog has been incorporated in the coat of arms of Bungay, and has been used in the titles of various enterprises associated with Bungay.

Impeachment of Merceditas Gutierrez

The Philippine Ombudsman Merceditas Gutierrez was impeached by the House of Representatives on charges of the office's alleged underperformance and failure to act on several cases during the presidency of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. She became the second official after President Joseph Estrada in 2000 to be impeached.
While the first impeachment complaint against her was filed in 2009, it was dismissed later in that year in a 14th Congress dominated by Arroyo's Lakas Kampi CMD party. In 2010, with the election of Benigno Aquino III of the Liberal Party as president and the concurrent elections to the House of Representatives and the subsequent political realignment, two impeachment cases against her were voted as sufficient in form, substance and grounds, and the House of Representatives Committee on Justice had found probable cause on alleged betrayal of public trust as based on the two complaints.
On March 22, 2011, the House of Representatives voted to impeach Gutierrez, sending the committee report as the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate which will act as an impeachment court. A vote of at least two-thirds (16) of all senators (24) is required to convict Gutierrez and remove her from office. However, Gutierrez resigned on April 29, 2011, thereby canceling the impeachment trial of the Senate.
Background.
The ombudsman is one of the several impeachable officials: the others being the president, vice president, justices of the Supreme Court and the members of the constitutional commissions (Audit, Civil Service and Elections). The following acts are considered as impeachable offenses: culpable violation of the Constitution, treasons, bribery, graft and corruption, other high crimes, and betrayal of public trust. Furthermore, only one "impeachment proceeding" is allowed to be held against an official in a year, although the definition of the term "impeachment proceeding" and "year" have been vague. The House of Representatives has the sole power to impeach, while the Senate has the sole power to try the impeached official. The House of Representatives needs one-third of its members to impeach an official, while the Senate needs to muster two-thirds of its members to convict.
2009 case.
In 2005, Merceditas Gutierrez was appointed by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as ombudsman, succeeding outgoing Simeon Marcelo who had resigned. After her appointment, several figures of the Arroyo administration were involved in political scandals such as the NBN-ZTE controversy, the Fertilizer Fund scam, the Euro Generals scandal, among others.
In 2009, a group of civil society personalities led by former Senate President Jovito Salonga filed an impeachment case against Gutierrez on March 2. The complaint, referred to the Committee on Justice headed by Arroyo's partymate at Lakas Kampi CMD Matias Defensor, Jr. of Quezon City, cited these issues:
On November 18, the House Committee on Justice dismissed the case; while deeming the complaint "sufficient in form," it was deemed as not "sufficient in substance." The committee report stated that "The factual allegations are, at best, a rehash of the allegations for the impeachable offense of betrayal of public trust," and that the suspensions of Tupas and Garcia were justifiable. The report was brought to the plenary on November 18.
2010 cases.
In 2010, two impeachment cases were filed against Gutierrez, both by left-leaning parties: first from Akbayan Citizens' Action Party and one from the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (BAYAN; New Patriotic Alliance). These two complaints were referred to the Committee on Justice which is now chaired by Iloilo's 5th district representative Niel Tupas, Jr. of President Aquino's Liberal Party at August 22.
While Akbayan and BAYAN are both left-leaning parties, they are ideological rivals.
Complaints.
Akbayan complaint.
On July 2010, former Akbayan representative Risa Hontiveros-Baraquel led the filing of an impeachment complaint against Gutierrez. The complaint cited these issues:
BAYAN complaint.
BAYAN filed their own case on early August 2010. Led by Renato Reyes, BAYAN cited these issues on their complaint:
Sufficient in form and substance.
The House of Representatives' Committee on Justice voted on September 1, 2010 that the two complaints are sufficient in form. With the result, further hearings would be held to determine if the two complaints are sufficient in substance.
A week later, the committee voted that the two complaints are sufficient in substance: the first complaint passed via a 41–14 vote, while the second complaint passed with a 41–16 vote, with Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino (PMP; Force of the Filipino Masses)'s Rufus Rodriguez of Cagayan de Oro's 2nd district abstaining as he refused to recognize the second complaint. The committee vote was the first time an impeachment complaint was deemed to be sufficient in substance since the Arroyo presidency. The minority bloc tried to delay the vote by objecting the approval of the minutes, and denying that they were supplied with copies of the complaints, even if their staff had earlier stated that they had received them. Lakas Kampi CMD's Simeon Datumanong of Maguindanao's 2nd district insisted that the second complaint be barred; Majority leader Neptali Gonzales II of Mandaluyong answered that while the constitution forbids two impeachment proceedings, it does not forbid two impeachment complaints, adding that the two complaints can be consolidated for they were simultaneously referred to the committee.
On the same day, Iloilo 4th district Representative Ferjenel Biron and former Iloilo vice governor Rolex Suplico of the Nacionalista Party disclosed that Tupas has a pending case on the ombudsman, and that he should inhibit himself from the proceedings. Suplico filed a complaint against Tupas on the latter's alleged "ghost seminars" while he was still a member of the Iloilo Provincial Board. Tupas defeated Suplico in the 2010 Iloilo 5th district House of Representatives election, while Biron defeated Tupas' father in the 2010 Iloilo 4th district House of Representatives election.
Supreme Court's "status quo ante" order.
On September 13, Gutierrez filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition to the Supreme Court to stop the impeachment proceedings against her. Gutierrez cited the one-year ban hearing more than one impeachment proceedings. Tupas said that in a previous decision, the Supreme Court allowed two separate complaints initiated at the same time. The next day, the court granted Gutierrez a "status quo ante" order, or all parties should observe the conditions prior to the proceedings, thereby suspending impeachment proceedings against her.
The representatives protested the "status quo ante" order, with Akbayan representative Walden Bello saying that "it is an interference with the prerogative of a co-equal branch of government," adding that only Congress can "promulgate" its own rules on impeachment. Speaker of the House of Representatives Feliciano Belmonte (Liberal, Quezon City–4th) had earlier said that while it respects the court's decision, the House of Representatives will proceed with its impeachment proceedings. The move was seen to benefit Gutierrez, and former president and now Pampanga 2nd district representative Arroyo;
Five months later on February 15, 2011, the Supreme Court dismissed their "status quo ante" order, "thereby effectively allowing the House committee on justice to proceed with the impeachment," said court spokesman Midas Marquez. There were seven justices concurring, five dissenting, and another two concurring on allowing the first of the complaints from proceeding; Justice Presbitero Velasco inhibited himself as his son is a member of the House of Representatives (representing Marinduque as member of the Lakas-Kampi). Marquez said that while there were two separate complaints, "there is only one proceeding." The court ruled that since Gutierrez can still file an answer, hence there was no violation of due process.
However, further hearings were held off as the Supreme Court as not given a final decision on Gutierrez's petition. Speaker Belmonte said that the committee cannot meet until the court's decision is finalized. Meanwhile, the executive announced that it would not interfere with the proceedings at the House of Representatives. On February 22, the committee voted to resume their impeachment hearings in a 21–5 vote, after a meeting with Belmonte, who became convinced that the committee can proceed even without the court's final decision, as stated by Deputy Speaker Lorenzo Taňada III of the Liberal Party from Quezon's 4th district.
Supreme Court Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno later disclosed that the Supreme Court did not debate on the merits on Gutierrez's petition, saying that "several members of the court" had not seen the petition, and that no resolution was made; spokesman Marquez just delivered a news conference to announce the court's ruling. Sereno is the sole appointee of President Aquino; the other 14 justices are appointed by Arroyo.
Sufficient grounds.
A day before the committee (February 28) met to decide if the two complaints are sufficient in grounds, Gutierrez filed before the Supreme Court a motion for reconsideration.
At the hearing, Alagad party-list representative Rodante Marcoleta questioned if the committee should wait for the court's decision on Gutierrez's motion for reconsideration. After the minutes of the previous meeting was approved, Nacionalista Party member Marc Douglas Cagas IV from Davao del Sur's 1st district motioned to reconsider the approval of the minutes, which was denied by vice chairperson Rodolfo Fariñas (Nacionalista, Ilocos Norte–1st) since Cagas was absent at the previous meeting. After several minutes of arguing whether to wait for a Supreme Court decision, Rodolfo Albano (Lakas-Kampi, Isabela–1st) motioned to wait for the decision; the motion was defeated 8–37. Tupas read a letter submitted by Gutierrez, and the representatives debated anew on whether to wait for the court's decision; Fariñas later bared his plan on filing impeachment cases against the justices for not reading Gutierrez's petition before issuing the "status quo ante" order. The committee ultimately voted that both complaints were sufficient in grounds, with the first complaint passing on a 41–12 vote, and the second complaint approved on a 42–12 decision.
Determination of probable cause.
The day before the hearing for the determination of probable cause, the Liberal Party members of the House of Representatives adapted a position to support the impeachment proceedings at a meeting where President Aquino attended. Apart from the Liberals, seven representatives from militant parties support the impeachment of Gutierrez.
Gutierrez, who had been boycotting the hearings of the committee, instead sent her lawyer and a reply at the March 8 hearing. On her reply, she stated that "She cannot produce documents because this would render, according to her, moot and academic the issues raised in the motion for reconsideration with the Supreme Court," said Tupas, quoting Gutierrez. She further said that the subpoena given to her was oppressive, and that she has confidentiality of records. She instead attended a press conference of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines where she branded the committee as a "kangaroo court," citing that as a reason for her non-appearance. Gutierrez said that the proceedings were a "partisan political exercise," and that she denied asking for support of Representative Arroyo and her allies in the House of Representatives.
At the hearing, the representatives from the minority hit the lack of due process accorded to Gutierrez, and the railroading of the proceedings. To emphasize the point, minority leader Edcel Lagman (Lakas-Kampi, Albay–1st) and Pedro Romualdo (Lakas-Kampi, Camiguin) brought with them a stack of documents two feet high delivered to them the day before, on which they have to read to make an intelligent assessment of the complaints. Representative from Iloilo's 2nd district Augusto Syjuco asked Tupas to inhibit himself as he has a pending case before the ombudsman, but Tupas dismissed his request. Deputy Speaker Raul Daza (Liberal, Northern Samar–1st) remarked that Gutierrez had already been given enough time to respond to the complaints.
While the hearing was ongoing, the Supreme Court dismissed Gutierrez's motion for reconsideration as the committee did not violate the one-year ban on multiple impeachment proceedings, with the spokesman explaining that "These two complaints were received (by the Justice committee) at the same time. Provided there is only one proceeding – regardless of number of complaints – the impeachment proceeding can go on," adding that the decision was final and no more appeals would be accepted. After the committee was notified of the court's decision, the committee decided to put to a vote in determining probable cause. The first (Akbayan's) complaint was voted upon first, and passed with a 39–12 vote and one abstention, while the BAYAN complaint also passed via 39–6 vote, with one abstention; the abstentions came from Lagman.
Result of the vote.
This were the results of the votes according the Justice Committee:
Referral to the plenary.
After the committee votes, the committee will submit a committee report to the plenary which shall be voted upon by the entire House. The committee created an 11-man prosecution panel in case the House of Representatives votes to impeach the ombudsman, while a seven-man committee was formed to draft the report.
The senators from the Liberal Party on the hand, say that they were not given instructions on how to deal with an impeachment trial, as there were no senators present at the aforementioned meeting. Sergio Osmeña III said that the president may have to be more discreet on it, while Gregorio Honasan remarked that Aquino should "refrain from making statements that will be misconstrued as partisan statements." Senators Honasan and Osmeña are independents.
Meanwhile, the executive department denied that President Aquino "gave marching orders" to Liberal Party members of the House of Representatives, and that the separation of powers was not violated. This comes as members of the minority bloc criticized Aquino for "dictating" to his allies in the House of Representatives, with Lagman saying that impeachment is not solely political process but is "impressed with judicial process."
The committee report will include the following six allegations that will prove that Gutierrez betrayed the public trust:
The following representatives shall compose the House of Representatives' legal team that will present the committee report to the plenary. All are from the Liberal Party unless stated otherwise:
The weekend before the plenary votes on the committee report, Joseph Emilio Abaya, chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, denied accusations that a text attributed to him saying those who would not vote for the impeachment will not receive their share of their pork barrel. Several non-Liberal Party representatives were angry with the text message. Meanwhile, Tupas disclosed that a "high-ranking officer" of the Iglesia ni Cristo had been calling representatives to kill the impeachment complaint, or don't show up at the vote. Bello remarked that this is against the separation of church and state.
On March 21, the House of Representatives tackled the committee's report. Tupas, Daza, Fariñas and Tañada delivered their sponsorship speeches in support of the committee report. After the sponsorship speeches, Representatives Lagman, Suarez, Marcoleta, Carlos M. Padilla, Syjuco, Albano, Mitos Magsaysay and Cagas served as interpellators. In the period of interpellation, Tupas gave way to Fariñas when it was Syjuco's turn to interpellate. Syjuco then accused Tupas of vested interest; Deputy Speaker Arnulfo Fuentebella (NPC, Camarines Sur–4th) reminded him to "to avoid attacking personalities," and motioned to strike off Syjuco's remarks from the record for being "unparliamentary language." Syjuco, who called Tupas "a coward," was about to divulge the meeting among Tupas, Tupas Sr., and Gutierrez; Tupas said that as being his godfather at his wedding, he could not face Syjuco. Syjuco later cut short his interpellation, but after accusing Tupas anew of using the impeachment as part of his senatorial ambitions.
Before midnight, the impeachment was put through a vote, after which Deputy Speaker Fuentebella announced the result. With 4 representatives abstaining, 47 against, and 210 for the impeachment, the House impeached Gutierrez. The minority bloc, Nacionalista Party and the NPC did not have a common stand but instead had a "conscience vote." Tañada announced a correction in the tally after some votes were misrecorded, with the revised tally having 212 votes for impeachment, with 46 against and four abstentions. The NPC withdrew the conscience vote and voted for impeachment as a bloc; the newly formed National Unity Party, a party created by Lakas-Kampi defectors was split with some members led by Southern Leyte representative Roger Mercado going against the party's "no" stand. The sectoral representatives also voted for impeachment, in opposition to their leader Rodante Marcoleta (Alagad) who was against. Gutierrez lambasted her impeachment, calling the decision "flimsy" and "lamentable," saying that she did not receive fair treatment and that she is prepared to face the Senate, and blaming "dark" politics with the Justice Committee's undue haste on the proceedings.
The House of Representatives was having a difficult time on naming other members of the prosecution, with Magtanggol Gunigundo I (Lakas-Kampi, Valenzuela–2nd) being added; Elpidio Barzaga (NUP, Dasmariñas (Cavite–4th)) was reportedly considered but his links to Arroyo was seen to be too strong.
Senate impeachment trial.
On March 23, Tupas and company, including the two leading complainants, personally submitted to the Senate the Articles of Impeachment. Later that day, the Senate adopted its rules for impeachment, adopting the rules used in the 2000 impeachment of Joseph Estrada with amendments such as maintaining the silence of the visitors and neutrality among the senators.
Gutierrez resigned on April 29, personally handling her resignation letter to President Aquino; the president accepted the ombudsman's resignation. With her resignation, the senate canceled the impeachment trial. The senators thanked the ombudsman for "sparing" the country from a "tedious, divisive, and painful" impeachment process; Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile thanked her as the senate can now concentrate on legislative matters.

Cambroclave

Cambroclaves are a group of enigmatic, phosphatized, hollow spine-shaped sclerites, known from their geographically widespread Early to Middle Cambrian fossils. They were probably originally aragonitic. They are lobate with long spines protruding centrally; these spines are in some cases (e.g. "Zhijinites") pillar-like, constituted of a bundle rods (originally aragonite?) with an Ionic-like appearance. It has been suggested that they represent the spicules of an ecdysozoan worm.

Afro-Central American

There are African descended population of the countries of Central America, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama, all part of the Western Caribbean Zone. One group was delivered largely in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to work in mines on the Pacific site of the area, and most lost their specific African identity over time and through custom. Their present day descendants speak Spanish. The other group had more diverse origins, but often had connections with England. One group arrived with a shipwrecked slave ship in the seventeenth century, the Miskito Sambu, another group were brought by English settlers on the Mosquito Coast and in Belize, a third group arrived from the island of St Vincent, deported by the English in 1797, the Garifuna, and another came in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries from Jamaica, the Bay Islands, Cayman Islands and occasionally other English Caribbean colonies through labor schemes of the large American transportation and fruit growing concerns.
Origins and History.
Afro-Central Americans were initially formed by the trans-Atlantic slave trade that brought African workers to the mines of the "Kingdom of Guatemala" as the Spanish called their main Central American colony. In addition, the Spanish brought many slaves to Panamá to assist in transporting silver from the mines at Potosí from the Pacific to the Atlantic side of the isthmus. In addition to providing a good portion of the inhabitants of the towns of Panama and Portobello, many ran away to the nearby mountains which were outside Spanish control to form cimarron communities. Some of these Africans also transported metals from mines in Guatemala to the Atlantic coast ports of Trujillo or Puerto de Caballos in modern day Honduras. Some of the slaves from these regions also ran away and formed their own communities as well.
Miskito Sambu.
In the 1640s slaves on a Portuguese vessel revolted, captured the ship and ran it aground at Cape Gracias a Dios. They were received by the indigenous Miskito people and intermarried with them, creating the Miskitu-Sambu. This mixed race element, in turn, eventually came to dominate the Mosquito Kingdom (as the Miskito region was called), controlling the office of king and several subordinate positions. In the eighteenth century, they became feared raiders who captured slaves and sold them, often to English merchants.
The English alliance, which had been pioneered by Miskito kings as early as 1640, continued under Zambo leadership, eventually allowing the English to settle on the coast in the 1740s. Many of the English settlers, concentrated around Black River and Bluefields, brought slaves with them to work in wood cutting and transport, though creating a new African-descended element in the population. Though the Spanish eventually forced the evacuation of the coast, the Miskito remained in possession and the English continued to have an important role to play. Many of the English and their slaves left the Mosquito Coast in the 1780s following the treating giving the areas back to Spain and relocated in British Honduras.
English Slaves in the Bay of Honduras and Mosquito Coast.
As the British were trading with and settling in the lands of the Mosquito Coast, they were also cutting wood in the Yucatan Peninsula. In the early eighteenth century they founded a settlement around the Belize River which would become the colony of British Honduras (Belize). After 1720 they began importing slaves in fair numbers, largely from Jamaica,or occasionally directly from Africa. Most of these slaves worked in logging, others in domestic service.
English settlers in the Miskito Kingdom following the Anglo-Misito treaty of 1740 began importing African slaves in fair numbers. Their estates were especially concentrated in the Black River (Rio Tinto) in today's Honduras, and around Bluefields in modern Nicaragua. These slaves were employed in cutting timber, and in small scale agricultural enterprises growing subsistence crops or export crops like sarsaparilla. Some sugar was grown, and English planners sometimes spoke of expanding this sector, but in the end sugar never took off and a sugar complex like that of Jamaica or other Caribbean islands never developed. In 1786, following the London Conference, the English agreed to vacate the Miskito Kingdom of its English residents and their slaves, and several thousands left, bound for Belize.
However, a fairly large number of the slaves took advantage of the situation to flee, or to remain where they were. Others were free but did not heed the order to depart. Most of those who remained took to subsistence farming, fishing and trading on a small scale on the coast, and a few became locally prominent, especially the former slaves of Robert Hodgson, once the Superintendent of the Mosquito Shore, who had abandoned the coast in 1790.
The Garifuna.
In 1797 the English introduced a new element onto the coast of Central America, which was the introduction of the Garifuna, people of mixed African and Carib descent who were deported from the Island of St Vincent for supporting France during the wars of the French Revolution in the Caribbean. Garifuna soon defected to the Spanish and many settled around Trujillo, while others accepted land grants in the Miskito Kingdom. Others still settled in British Honduras after 1802, especially in the Stanns Creek area.
The Anglo-Caribbean Migrants.
Following the end of slavery in the British Empire in 1838 a fairly large number of former slaves, disappointed with the limited opportunities available in post-slavery society, decided to leave the islands for destinations elsewhere in the Caribbean, such as the Cayman Islands, or the Bay Islands of Honduras. Many of them found the Miskito Kingdom to be a good destination, especially those from Jamaica which had long ties with the coast, not only through diplomatic contact but also informal activities such as Miskito turtle fishing.
In the 1830s the kingdom was completely independent, had no master class, and relaxed concepts of race and authority. As a result many of the ex-slaves founded or joined settlements at the major rivers, or sites of previous plantations whose masters had abandoned them when the British evacuated the Mosquito Coast in 1786. The existence of a free former slave population there, who spoke English primarily made the coast particularly attractive. By the 1860s they formed prosperous communities and were willing to cooperate with English designs to protect the region from outside interference, while also welcoming the special relationship they enjoyed with English officials who came with the Protectorate, founded in 1844.
The willingness of Miskito king George Augustus Frederic to allow a special council to govern in his behalf, in 1846 led to the domination of the council by the African descended population, both those drawn from the slaves of the previous English residents and the more recently arrived mostly Jamaicans led to an increase in their power and influence. As a result the region, and particularly Bluefields, the capital of the Miskito Kingdom since 1844, became a magnet for a wide range of Afro-Caribbean people seeking freedom, opportunity and even self-government.
The two distinct Afro-Caribbean groups gradually merged to create the Creoles, as they are known locally, and they gained even more power as Britain abandoned its claims to Protectorate status in 1860 and Nicaragua proved unable to step in and take over the government of the area. It was only in 1894 that Nicaraguan forces stopped the actual autonomy of the Miskito Kingdom, and real Nicaraguan authority really began only in the early twentieth century.
Beginning in the late nineteenth century a number of United States based firms, notably the United Fruit and Standard Fruit brought many workers from the English speaking Caribbean to work on their infrastructure (mostly railroad) projects and the banana plantations that they developed all along the coast of Central America. Others came as a result of the construction of the Panama Canal.
The American companies, exploiting timber and tropical fruit, especially bananas, created valuable resources on the Atlantic side of all the Central American countries and increased both their interest and their capacity to occupy the regions effectively. As they did so, the Afro-Caribbean influence was eclipsed.

Cyberphobia is a concept introduced in 1985, described as a specific phobia expressed as "an irrational fear of or aversion to computers" or more generally, a fear and/or inability to learn about new technologies. 
Some forms of cyberphobia may range from the more passive forms of technophobia of those who are indifferent toward cyberspace to the responses of those who see digital technology as a medium of intrusive surveillance; more extreme responses may involve anti-technological paranoia expressed by social movements that radically oppose ‘technological society’ and ‘the New World Order’.
Suggested treatments include hypnotherapy, Neuro-linguistic programming, and medication prescribed for general symptoms of anxiety or phobias (SSRIs, MAOIs, Beta blockers).

Battle of Barcelona (1359)

The Battle of Barcelona (June 9–11, 1359) was a naval engagement fought in the coastal region of Barcelona, Spain, between the navies of the Crowns of Aragon and Castile, during the War of the Two Peters. A number of months beforehand, a large Castilian fleet had been assembled at Seville by order of the King of Castile, Peter I. Consisting of 128 warships including royal vessels, ships from the King of Castile's vassals, and several others that had been sent by the Castilian-allied monarchs of Portugal and Granada, this large fleet had been entrusted to the Genoese admiral, Egidio Boccanegra, who was seconded by two of his relatives, Ambrogio and Bartolome.
With Peter I also on board, as well as many distinguished noblemen and knights, the Castilian fleet set sail from Seville in April. Traversing the coast of Valencia and forcing the surrender of the Castle of Guardamar, it appeared before Barcelona on June 9. The king, Peter IV of Aragon and III of Barcelona, who was present at the city, organized the defense, together with the counts, Bernat III of Cabrera and Hug II of Cardona. The Catalans disposed of ten galleys, a nau, and several small craft garrisoned by companies of crossbowmen, besides a line of siege weapons. Despite its inferior size, the fleet managed to repulse the Castilian attacks in a two-day battle that saw the first use of naval artillery: a bombard was mounted aboard the Catalan nau and her shots heavily damaged one of the biggest naus of Peter I.
Background.
The "War of the Two Peters" broke out in 1356, when a squadron of nine Catalan galleys under Francesc de Perellós (sent by King Peter IV of Aragon to assist the House of Valois in their succession conflict with the House of Plantagenet) captured two ships under the flag of the Republic of Genoa near Sanlúcar de Barrameda. At that time, the captured ships were engaged in a war against the Republic of Venice and the Crown of Aragon. King Peter I of Castile, who was present at Sanlúcar during the event, felt offended and demanded that the Genoese vessels be liberated from Perellós.
Perellós refused Peter's demands and was chased by Castilian warships as far as the Portuguese coast. Peter of Castile complained afterwards to King Peter IV of Aragon, but as he did not obtain the desired results, he declared war on the Crown of Aragon. While both crowns promptly engaged in a bloody frontier war by land, in mid-1358 the naval campaign began with the landing of a Castilian army at the Valencian town of Guardamar. Led by Peter I, they quickly occupied the town. Its castle, however, held out for longer, and when a storm drove most of the Castilian fleet ashore, including six hired Genoese galleys, Peter I had to set them on fire and return to Castile through Murcia, defeated.
The following year Peter of Castile organized a larger expedition. Numerous ships were built at the shipyards of Seville, and many others were requested from Cantabria. The king, Peter I of Portugal, and Muhammed V, Sultan of Granada, also contributed ships to the increase in Peter's fleet. In all, the Castilian expedition numbered 128 vessels, of which twenty-eight galleys and two galiots were royal ships. Eighty others were Atlantic naus from the Cantabrian "Villas", while the Portuguese and the Granadines sent ten and three galleys, respectively; a Venetian nau was also hired. Peter hoisted his flag in a large nau captured from the Marinids during the Siege of Algeciras by Alfonso X, which had been reinforced with three castles, one of them entrusted to the chronicler and naval captain, Pedro López de Ayala; another was entrusted to Arias González de Valdés, while the third was overseen by García Álvarez de Toledo. The ship's crew consisted of 100 men-at-arms and 120 crossbowmen, along with its sailors and Peter's entourage. This fleet set sail on April and moved along the coast of Valencia, where the Castle of Guardamar was captured. On June 9 it was within sight of Barcelona.
Battle.
The naval forces gathered at the port of Barcelona consisted of ten well-armed galleys, several sailing ships and a very large vessel following the appearance of Peter I in the city. The forces were under the command of the generals, Bernat III of Cabrera and Hug II of Cardona, with Bernat and Gilabert de Cruilles, Bernat Margarit, and Pere Asbert as captains. The king, Peter of Aragon, took the command of the fleet and detached the galleys in a line along the beach, with the huge nau in middle of the line. All the vessels were covered by a shoal known as ""Las Tascas"", which stretched from just before the Convent of Sant Nicolau de Bari to he road of Regomir. Four machines named "brigoles" were installed near the shores to give additional coverage to the ships, which were reinforced by many companies of crossbowmen who had come from the Vallès under the command of several knights including Ramón de Pujol, Ramón and Bernat Planella, Bernat de Perapetusa, Ramón Berenguer de Vilafranca and Humbert de Ballestar. Armed parties of Barcelona's civilians organized according to their office were also divided along the perimeter to support the fleet.
According to the Castilian chronicler and captain López de Ayala, during the night the Catalans ran down numerous anchors before their line with the aim of keeping the Castilian ships as they approached the port to began the attack. Whether true or not, the Castilian fleet sailed through the shoals and a stubborn battle ensued. At nightfall, Peter I withdrew his vessels and the battle renewed at 10 AM, the following day. Then the Catalan crossbowmen inflicted heavy casualties upon the Castilian seamen and soldiers, and the Catalan artillery also caused serious damage to many ships. One of the biggest Castilian naus was hit twice by the fire of a bombard mounted aboard the largest Catalan nau, which demolished its castles and dismasted it.
Aftermath.
The Castilian fleet divided and part of the ships headed to the Llobregat river to get water. There they were confronted by many peasants of Barcelona and Sant Boi, and Peter I reorganized his forces and sailed to Ibiza, where he placed its castle under siege. Peter IV gathered a force of 50 galleys collected from Collioure, which he entrusted to Admiral Count of Osona with Cardona as vice-admiral. Relieving the island, the Castilian army left the siege and reembarked. Though he had numerical advantage, Peter I chose not to join the battle and withdrew. He was pursued by 15 or 20 galleys under Bernat de Cabrera. This force then anchored at the Denia estuary. The Castilians were then willing of fight, but as the Aragonese position was strong and supported by land forces, Peter I decided to sail back to Seville. Upon his arrival, Peter found that his armies had been defeated on 22 September in the largest land battle of the war at Araviana.

Scanlon plan

The Scanlon plan has been successfully used by a variety of public and private companies for many decades. These plans combine leadership, total workforce education, and widespread employee participation with a reward system linked to group and/or organization performance. The Scanlon plan is a gain sharing program in which employees share in pre-established cost savings, based upon employee effort. Formal employee participation is necessary with the Scanlon Plan, as well as periodic progress reporting and an incentive formula 
Origin.
The first Scanlon plan was instituted by Joseph N.Scanlon(1899–1956) a steelworker, cost accountant, professional boxer, local union president, Acting Director of the Steelworkers Research Department, and Lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). As the local union president of the steel mill in which he was employed, he witnessed the depressed economy of the 1930s. His employees wanted increased wages, his company had barely survived the depression. He was advised by the Steelworkers International to see if he could harness the energy and talents of the workers to save the company. Scanlon set up joint union/management committees to solve organizational problems. The committees became successful and Scanlon was soon asked to help other organizations in trouble. His success led him to become Acting Director of the Steelworker's Research Department. Scanlon became active in setting up many labor/management committees in support of War production for WWII. 
Scanlon's work with joint union/management committees convinced him of the power of cooperation and he was an advocate of working with management in the Steelworkers. At the end of WWII the faction advocating a cooperative approach in labor/management was displaced by those advocating a return to traditional adversarial relations in the Steelworkers. Scanlon accepted an invitation by Douglas McGregor to become a Lecturer at MIT where he remained until his death.
At MIT, Scanlon continued to develop his ideas about labor/management cooperation and organizational improvement. It was at MIT that the term "Scanlon Plan" was coined by accident. There were two conferences going on at MIT and signs were needed to guide attendees. Thus those headed to Scanlon's event were directed to the Scanlon Plan and the name stuck.
The original labor/management teams that Scanlon created did not include a bonus. Early on they were created to save distressed companies or to encourage war production. Scanlon believed that much distrust existed between labor and management because there was a lack of information sharing. He believed that, given information about the company and a chance to participate in helping solve problems, the average worker would contribute to the success of the company. Scanlon did not believe in what he called "the economic man theory." Piece work systems and ideas about human motivation at the time reduced the worker to something that was thought to be only motivated by money. Scanlon believed that people were motivated by many things besides money—a chance to make a difference, pride, fellowship, etc. Eventually Scanlon included an organizational bonus system as part of the plan. Often these systems replaced piece work systems that were common at that time. Douglas McGregor would study Scanlon'd clients to develop his Theory Y vs Theory X. Scanlon Plans were considered one of the best ways to develop Theory Y.
Scanlon's work with the Admanson Company was featured in a Life Magazine article "Every man a Capitalist" by John Chamberlain, December 1946. His work with Lapointe was featured in a Fortune article "Enterprise for Everyman" by John Davenport, January 1950. Time Magazine wrote that Joe Scanlon was the most sought after consultant of his time in "Management: The Scanlon Plan, September 1955. 
Two of Scanlon's colleagues carried on his work - Fred Lesieur who he had met at the Lapointe Tool Company and Dr. Carl F. Frost at MIT. Carl Frost would take the ideas west to Michigan State University which became a center for Scanlon thought and practice for many years. Frost would also create the Frost/Scanlon Principles of Identity, Participation, Equity and Competence. Frost's clients would create the Scanlon Plan Association which today is the Scanlon Leadership Network...a nonprofit Network of Organizations with Scanlon Plans. Frost worked with Herman Miller, Donnelly, Motorola, and Beth Israel Hospital all who were in the top 50 Best Places to Work while they were practicing Scanlon methods.
Fred Lesieur carried on the Scanlon Conferences at MIT until the 1980s. He consulted and implemented Scanlon Plans widely. Dana corporation was in the top 100 Best Places to work while they had their Lesieur Scanlon Plan.
Because the Scanlon plan was originated during the crisis of depression, it was initially presumed that it was for failing companies. However it later got instituted in Adamson Company to improve a healthy situation. Scanlon Plans have been successfully installed in Manufacturing, Retail, Health care, Financial Services and Telecommunications. There is no central registry of Scanlon Plans and the Scanlon Plan was not copyrighted or trademarked. Scanlon Plans were implemented in at least the following organizations: Adamson, Advanced Business Graphics, Atlantic Automotive, ARaymond, Atwood, American Tape, Beth Israel Hospital, Bradford, Bridgestone-Firestone, Briggs & Stratton, Canon, Dana, ELGA, Fairchild-Burns, Ferro, Harley Davidson,Herman Miller, Hitachi Magnetics, Hron Signs, ITT, Kysor-Cadillac, Lapointe, Landscape Forms, Limerick Veterinary Hospital, Lorin, Magna-Donnelly, Martin-Marietta, Meier, Michigan Bell, Motorola, National Manufacturing, Neelon Castings, Nicholas Plastics, Pacific Cast, Parker Pen, Pohlman, Quality Container, Raynor, S & L Plastics, Sara Lee, Sears, SGS Tool Company, Sligh, Spring, Thermatron, Thomson-Shore, TG Fluids, Trans-Matic, United Building Centers, US Vision, Watermark Credit Union, Wescast, Westling, Wolverine Worldwide, and Xaloy. Thus Scanlon plans have been utilized both as a means of saving firms from economic collapse as well as a mechanism for reducing labor and production costs and to provide increased worker participation in organization whose immediate economic situation is not bad. They have been installed in union and nonunion organizations, for profit and not for profits and large as well as small organizations.
Participation and Committees.
The philosophy of the plan is to promote group co-operation and solving of organizational problems. Cooperation and involvement start in the creation of the plan with a Design Team and continue once the Plan is implemented with Production and Screening Teams.
Design Team.
Scanlon Plans, unlike most other gainsharing systems, are installed using a high engagement process. The process was labelled the Roadmap by Carl Frost. It begins with an exploration of Scanlon by the top leader of the organization considering a Scanlon Plan. If the leader feels the Scanlon Plan makes sense for his/her organization a "mandate" is drafted. The mandate explains why change is necessary. The top leader then brings together the top leadership team and explains the mandate and asks the following questions. 1) Is there a compelling need to change? 2) Are we able, willing and ready? 3)Can the Scanlon Plan help us to meet the mandate? The top leader asks for a secret ballot vote to proceed. Usually unless the vote is unanimous the Scanlon Roadmap does not proceed further. If the top team is ready, willing and able, they explain the mandate and Scanlon Roadmap to the organization's Middle Managers and Supervisors. They asks the entire management team to support the mandate and the Scanlon Roadmap. Usually unless 80% of the entire management team supports Scanlon by secret ballot the roadmap does not go any further. The Managers and Supervisors along with the top Leadership Team then explain the mandate and Scanlon Roadmap to the entire workforce. Again a secret ballot is taken and unless 80–90% of the workforce support the Mandate and the roadmap the process stops. This top down approach coupled with multiple secret ballots assures the following: 1) Top level commitment and support 2) A reason for Scanlon and change 3) Alignment of the entire management team including front line supervisors 4) Understanding and commitment by the entire work force
Assuming the organization supports the Scanlon Roadmap a Design Team is created. The Design Team is made up of both elected and appointed members. The Design Team takes the theory of Scanlon and creates a written Plan for how Scanlon will be practiced in the organization. Often today, the Design Team will break into four subcommittees based on the Frost/Scanlon Principles of Identity, Participation, Equity and Competence. While the plan is being drafted minutes are shared throughout the Organization so that everyone is aware of the progress of the Design Team. When the Design Team feels it has done its best work they vote on taking the plan to the Organization. Unless the Design Team is unanimous in their decision to proceed they continue working on the plan. The plan is then taken to the Board of Directors for final approval. The Design Team then takes the Plan to the entire Organization and asks for a vote to try the Plan for a trial period of a year or two. Most Organizations will require an 80–90% vote of approval. If the vote passes the plan is put into effect and the Design Team will monitor the plan and make adjustments during the trial period. At the end of the trial period the Plan is voted on one more time and made a permanent part of culture of the Organization. (Some organizations will renew the plan after a number of years by recreating a Design Team. Others will only vote or change the plan if there is a major change to the bonus formula or other aspects of the Plan).

Historically it was found that employee ideas were often not heard. This resulted in a two tiered system of committees. The first often called "Production Committees" were made up of employees and managers closest to the work. A second committee often called the "Screening or Scanlon Committees" were made up of representatives from throughout the Company or Organization. This committee is distributed throughout the organization including the clerical and office positions. Their jurisdictions generally correspond to departmental and shift responsibilities. This committee is usually composed of one management representative and one or more non-elected non-supervisory employees. The committees' job was to identify problems which interfered with increasing productivity, reduce costs and increase output. Small expenditure suggestions could be put into effect immediately, while large expenditure items or suggestions that involved multiple departments were sent to the second committee, which was the screening committee.
Screening Committee.
Oversight capability is contained within the screening committee. The screening committee holds representatives of senior management and an equal or greater number of elected non-supervisory representatives. In Organizations with a Union, they also may have a representative on the screening committee. This Committee has four main responsibilities. First it oversees the operation of the production committee. Secondly, all suggestions rejected by the production committee are reviewed by the screening committee. Third, it considers current business problems and internal and environmental issues and communicates them down throughout the organization. The final responsibility it the administration of the bonus plan. This often means communicating organizational performance.
The committee problem solving and communication structure in turn contribute to the achievement of a bonus. These benefits are shared by the entire workforce.
Participation and High Involvement Today.
Today there are many different ways that Scanlon Systems involve employees in Organizational problem solving. At Donnelly the Donnelly Committee approved all changes in Personnel Policies and adjudicated issues of fairness and equity. They even recommended pay increases. Six Sigma and Lean Practices are often used in Scanlon Organizations as part of their improvement plans.
Calculation of Scanlon Plan Bonus.
One of the greatest misconceptions of the Scanlon Plan is that it can be defined by the way the bonus is calculated. Historically, the Scanlon plan bonus was calculated on the historical ratio of labor cost to sales value of production. Scanlon believed that is was very important that employees understand how the bonus is calculated and this method was easy for employees to understand. He felt that profit sharing as a way to create a bonus was fine as long as everyone understood "profits." He concluded that most don't understand how profits are calculated. Today Scanlon Plans have been created that use only financial measures (like profits), operational measures (like quality) Combinations of financial measures and operational measures and no bonus at all.
Financial incentives under the Scanlon Plan are ordinarily offered to all employees including managers and sometimes executives. In several small Scanlon organizations the bonus was even offered to key suppliers.

Advantages.
A great deal of research has been conducted on the Scanlon Plan. Scanlon research was conducted at MIT, Michigan State University, The American Productivity Center, and The Scanlon Leadership Network. Dr. Mike Schuster, and Dr. Dow Scott have published many papers and chapters on the results of the Scanlon Plan. The Scanlon Plan has also been featured in The Compensation Handbook and many articles and chapters by the World of Work (American Compensation Association). In earlier studies the Scanlon Plan could be compared to the two other "named" gainsharing plans and the Scanlon Plan was found to produce higher levels of employee involvement. Scanlon Plans increase job satisfaction, financial literacy, engagement, financial performance, quality, and on time delivery. In studies of the Sears Scanlon Goalsharing plans, Scanlon Units were found to have higher levels of customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction and higher financial performance than control units. Most research today lumps Scanlon Plans into research on gainsharing as almost all plans are now customized.
A 1986 General Accounting Office Report on Gainsharing noted that Organizational-based gainsharing programs are achieving high success ...
All the gainsharing efforts in the DOD report cost savings (ranging from $7,000 to over $1 Million). Some of the installations also report indirect benefits, including decreased sick leave usage and reductions in work backlogs and overtime costs. In addition, some installations report that the gainsharing efforts, by focusing attention on organizational barriers to productivity improvements, help provide mechanisms and incentive for solving these problems.
A 1981 General Accounting Office Report on gainsharing concluded that the use of gainsharing programs in private industry had resulted in significant productivity improvements. Many of the firms in their review attributed significant work force savings to their gainsharing plans. "Savings averaged 17.3 percent at the 13 firms with annual sales of less than $100 million. At the other 11 firms annual sales were $110 million or greater, and savings averaged 16.4 percent." Of the 24 firms providing financial data, those with a gainsharing system "in effect the longest showed the best performance. Firms that had plans in operation over 5 years averaged almost 29 percent savings in work force cost for the most recent 5 year period, with individual firms' average savings ranging from 13.5 to 77.4 percent. Those firms with plans in operation less than 5 years averaged savings of 8.5 percent." These data support the contention that gainsharing systems continue to grow in terms of the benefits they provide and are an effective long term strategy to improve organizational performance. Regarding non-monetary benefits of gainsharing systems as reported in the 1981 GAO study, 80.6% reported improved labor-management relations, 47.2% reported fewer grievances, and 36.1% reported less absenteeism and reduced turnover.
In general, the vast majority of the firms in this study "expressed satisfaction with their plans," and believed "that the benefits originally anticipated were realized." They expressed belief "that their plans gave them a competitive advantage in marketing their products or services."
A 1982 New York Stock Exchange study reported that gainsharing programs were one of the six fastest growing human resource activities in companies with 500 or more employees.
A 1984 study of 33 documented case studies of gainsharing programs reported that "eighty percent of the companies reported measurable improvements in some hard measure of productivity, cost savings, or quality. Many of these gains were remarkable, ranging from 20 to 30 percent with some even larger. About three-quarters reported that some index of quality of work life improved, such as a decline in grievances, improvement in satisfaction or morale, or an enhanced work climate. Almost all of the cases found outstanding improvements in employee­ generated ideas for saving money and improving productivity and quality. More than half the gainsharing plans revealed improvements in every dimension studied, indicating that where gainsharing plans work, they work in a variety of areas. The gainsharing plans went beyond wage­ incentive plans by focusing on several key factors, including communication, cooperation between workers and management and problem-solving teams to improve product quality. Despite the need for a significant investment in development and implementation, the results were often dramatic and across the board. Bullock, R. J. (1984). Gainsharing – A Successful Track Record, World of Work Report, 9
In 1994 the Consortium for Alternative Reward Strategies (CARS) conducted an exhaustive benchmark study of Organization Performance & Rewards. The study is available for purchase from the World of Work (American Compensation Association). Among their findings: These Plans lead organization change as often as they lag it. Plans are installed to improve business performance through people rather than to attract and retain. Payouts are modest about 3% of base pay. Median organizations earned $2.34 for every dollar spent on payouts. Net return on plan investment is 134 percent! Rewards themselves were just one part of a total strategy to improve performance. Communications, employee involvement, feedback and financial justification of the plans were also important.
Scanlon Plans that follow the Frost Roadmap process find the process develops employees and allows them to manage, and change their plans with little need for outside expertise or consulting expenses. Also since the Scanlon Plan is an open-source system there is no cost to use the process, name or ideas. The main cost is the cost of employee time in the development and maintenance of the Plan. Most Plan bonuses are self funded from the gains that are created. This allows an organization to increase employee engagement and organizational performance and pay a bonus while generating over a 125% percent return.
Disadvantages.
The Scanlon Plan especially as practiced by Carl Frost with the Scanlon Roadmap installation process takes time to implement. It is not unusual for an organization of 200–300 people to spend a year involving, researching, and creating a plan. The Scanlon Plan is leader dependent. It requires top level involvement in creating the mandate and building commitment. It requires a servant-leader—someone who is willing to develop others. Since Scanlon Plans are relatively rare it can become difficult to find leaders with experience in knowing how to lead in a Scanlon organization. The Scanlon Plan requires Theory Y assumptions among most of the managers to be successful. (Workers want to work, the average employee has great creativity and ingenuity if given a chance to express them, etc.) Once a plan is installed it requires time and energy to maintain. A Scanlon Plan also requires a great deal of training and development of employees. In Organizations with large part-time staff and/or turnover it can become difficult to develop employees sufficiently. The Scanlon Plan requires a great deal of sharing of information. Most Scanlon organizations are "open-book" organizations. This can be a disadvantage for organizations that prefer or require greater secrecy. While the Scanlon Plan can lead organizational change once a plan is installed and becomes a way of life for an organization it is difficult to go back. Employees like the information sharing, high involvement, equitable culture Scanlon creates. This can make it difficult in Scanlon organizations to acquire or merge with non Scanlon organizations. Some Scanlon organizations have become rigid especially in regard to how the bonus is calculated and have resisted needed change. The Scanlon Plan is an organizational wide system. It requires an organizational unit that makes sense to employees. For example, a plant, or a self-sufficient unit, or a store, could develop a Scanlon Plan. An individual, team or department could not. While Scanlon plans have been installed in small and large organizations, very small organizations (30 or less employees) tend to not need the structure that Scanlon provides. Very large organizations may find it difficult to create the collaboration that Scanlon requires.

Robert Pye (Roundhead)

Sir Robert Pye (ca. 16201701) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1640 and 1660. He fought on the Parliamentary side in the English Civil War.
Biography.
Pye was the son of Sir Robert Pye the Elder, Auditor of the Exchequer, and his wife Mary Croker, daughter of John Croker of Batsford in Gloucestershire.
In December 1640, Pye was elected Member of Parliament for Woodstock in the Long Parliament. He was knighted by 1642. In the Civil War, he became colonel of Horse in General Fairfax's regiment. In the course of the war he besieged his father's mansion at Faringdon in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), which the latter allowed the royalists to garrison. In 1648 he was excluded from parliament under Pride's Purge.
Pye was elected MP for Berkshire for the First Protectorate Parliament in 1654 and for the Third Protectorate Parliament in 1659. He was involved in the attempt to restore King Charles II. and was appointed one of the treasurers for the money put aside for that purpose. Later he presented a petition from the county of Berkshire, complaining of the lack of a settled form of government and as a result was committed to the Tower of London for a breach of privilege. He moved for an Habeas Corpus, but judge Richard Newdigate decided that the court of King's Bench did not have the power to discharge him. When General Monck came to London, MPs passed a vote to release Pye from prison. In 1660, Pye was elected Member of Parliament for Berkshire in the Convention Parliament and after the Restoration he was nominated equerry to the king. 
Family.
Pye married Anne, eldest daughter of the famous parliamentarian, John Hampden, and had a family of three sons and one daughter, including Richard Pye MP and Edmund Pye MD, the great grandfather of the poet laureate, Henry James Pye. Pye inherited his father's ruinous estates in 1662 and eventually died in December 1701 and was buried in All Saints' Church, Faringdon.

Douglas Leopold

Douglas Leopold, nicknamed Coco, was a television and radio personality in Quebec, along with being a public relations specialist.
Douglas Leopold studied political science and music at McGill University and the Sorbonne. Upon his return to Montreal, Leopold first worked in public relations for the Saidye Bronfman Centre for the Arts (now the Segal Centre for Performing Arts) and Les Grands Ballets Canadiens.
His professional introduction to disco came in promoting the Montreal branch of Régine (an international chain of discotheques presided over by Régine Zylberberg). This in turn led to a radio show with CKMF-FM, an association which lasted from 1979 to 1988. He then moved to Los Angeles to work in public relations for Universal Studios Theme Parks.
Leopold was openly gay and earned the nickname Coco because he peppered his speech with this expression, as a form of punctuation. He appeared as "Coco" in "Scandale" (1982) and made many appearances on local television, identifying and commenting on new trends in fashion and lifestyles. Leopold's key concept was the jet set, which he did not identify simply with money or extravagance, but rather a certain conception of good taste and appropriate conduct.
Leopold was sued by Alain Montpetit, another Montreal media personality (and like Leopold, also worked at CKMF), when he accused him on air of the murder of a model. This led to the payment of a settlement of thirty thousand dollars to Montpetit. Two decades later, the case was reopened by the New York City Police, who received statements from a number of witnesses which linked Montpetit to the murder. These included a confession, from the woman who had provided Montpetit's alibi, that she had lied about Montpetit being with her.
Leopold did not smoke, drink or take drugs. Although a few months before his death Leopold continued to claim publicly that he was in perfect health and did not have AIDS, he died due to this illness on 4 April 1993, at the Chris Brownlie Hospice in Los Angeles.
A fictionalised version of Leopold, played by Paul Doucet, is one of the central characters in the 2010 Canadian film "Funkytown". Steve Galluccio, the scriptwriter for the film, had in fact once been interviewed by Leopold to be his assistant.

C/1999 F1 (Catalina) is a long-period comet discovered on March 23, 1999, by the Catalina Sky Survey.
The comet has an observation arc of 2,360 days allowing a good estimate of the orbit. The orbit of a long-period comet is properly obtained when the osculating orbit is computed at an epoch after leaving the planetary region and is calculated with respect to the center of mass of the solar system. C/1999 F1 will make its closest approach to Neptune in 2017. Using JPL Horizons, the barycentric orbital elements for epoch 2035-Jan-01 generate a semi-major axis of 33,300 AU, an apoapsis distance of 66,600 AU, and a period of approximately 6 million years.

<doc id="31111824" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31111824" title="Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group">
Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group

The Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) has been a standing body of the U.S. House of Representatives since 1993. Comprising five members of the House leadership (the Speaker, the majority and minority leaders, the majority and minority whips), it directs the activities of the . BLAG can direct the General Counsel to participate in litigation or file an amicus curiae brief in cases involving the interests of the House or BLAG can call for legislation or a House resolution authorizing the General Counsel to represent the House itself.
The House Office of General Counsel evolved from a low-level position that handled routine contracts. In the mid-1970s Speaker Tip O'Neil authorized it to handle constitutional questions, though it remained under the supervision of the House Clerk. The House authorized the Speaker to intervene in "Chadha v. INS", and after that lawsuit's resolution in 1983 the five members of the House leadership, without authorization from the House, established the "House Bipartisan Leadership Group" to represent the interests of the House in litigation, which it did several times as either intervenor or amicus over the next decade.
On January 5, 1993, the Democratic-majority House adopted a rule creating the Office of General Counsel under the control of the Speaker "who shall consult with a Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group which shall include the majority and minority leaderships." Republicans had offered without success an amendment that would have required approval by the entire House for the Office of Counsel to undertake certain kinds of litigation and enhanced BLAG's control of the office.
BLAG has acted in a wide range of cases. In 1997, BLAG filed an amicus brief in "Raines v. Byrd", an unsuccessful challenge to the Line Item Veto Act of 1996. During consideration of "Dickerson v. United States" (2000), BLAG submitted an amicus brief to the Fourth Circuit and to the Supreme Court arguing that judicial review of a statute should not extend to the political considerations underlying its enactment. In 2002, when a group of Democratic congressmen sued the Bush administration over access to census information, BLAG's Republican majority had the Office of House Council oppose them and argue that courts should not interfere in such disputes between the executive and legislative branches. In 2004, BLAG filed an amicus brief in "Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow" in support of a school district's practice of leading students in the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, including the words "under God." During the criminal proceedings against Rep. William Jefferson of Louisiana, following a unanimous vote of its five members, BLAG filed a brief calling for the return of papers seized from Jefferson's offices by the FBI in May 2006.
Defending the Defense of Marriage Act.
In 2011, when President Barack Obama announced that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) would no longer defend the constitutionality of Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), House Speaker John Boehner convened BLAG to authorize the House Office of General Counsel or other outside attorneys to take the place of the DOJ in defending the law. On March 9, 2011, BLAG by a vote of 3–2 directed the Office of General Counsel to defend DOMA. Attorneys representing BLAG filed a brief in U.S. District Court in San Francisco in "Golinski v. Office of Personnel Management", opposing an action brought by a federal employee to invalidate Section 3 of DOMA under which health insurance coverage to her same-sex spouse was denied. In "Golinski" and a series of lawsuits challenging DOMA, BLAG's role has not been limited to filing amicus briefs. Without opposition from opposing counsel, several District Courts have granted BLAG intervenor-defendant status. In one DOMA case, "McLaughlin v. Panetta", plaintiffs' attorneys asked the court, without success, to limit BLAG to filing an amicus curiae brief rather than participating as intervenor-defendant as it did in other DOMA cases. They argued that the House did not properly authorize BLAG to intervene and that BLAG's direct participation violated the separation of powers doctrine. The DOJ also questioned BLAG's standing to appeal a District Court decision, relying on "Buckley v. Valeo" (1976). Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi questioned the funding of BLAG's defense of DOMA, which in January 2013 BLAG capped at $3 million. 
On December 7, 2012, the Supreme Court, in agreeing to hear another DOMA case, "United States v. Windsor", asked the parties to address "whether the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the United States House of Representatives has Article III standing in this case". Article III of the U.S. Constitution restricts the judiciary to hearing cases and controversies, which the Supreme Court has long interpreted to require parties to a case to have a direct interest in the outcome, rather than the "generalized interest" that the Department of Justice claims BLAG has in the defense of DOMA. BLAG has countered, citing the Supreme Court's decision in "Chadha" that "Congress is ... a proper party" to defend the validity of a statute" in such circumstances.
On January 3, 2013, at the start of the 113th Congress, the House of Representatives included in its rules a provision authorizing BLAG to defend DOMA and related laws, mentioning the "Windsor" case by name. It also made BLAG's role explicit: "the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group continues to speak for, and articulate the institutional position of, the House in all litigation matters in which it appears". The Supreme Court ruled against BLAG in "Windsor" on June 26, and on July 18, BLAG acknowledged that in "Windsor" "he Supreme Court recently resolved the issue of DOMA Section 3's constitutionality" and said "it no longer will defend that statute".
Justice Anthony Kennedy's decision for the majority in "Windsor" noted that BLAG's participation in the case helped reassure the court that it was presented proper adversarial argument despite the fact that principal parties to the case, the administration and Windsor, were not at odds. The court also found that it "need not decide whether BLAG would have standing to challenge the District Court’s ruling and its affirmance in the Court of Appeals on BLAG's own authority." Justice Alito in dissent nevertheless argued that BLAG should have been allowed to defend the statute. He wrote that it was properly authorized to act on behalf of the House and had standing as an aggrieved party once part of DOMA was ruled unconstitutional because "the House of Representatives was a necessary party to DOMA's passage". He concluded: "in the narrow category of cases in which a court strikes down an Act of Congress and the Executive declines to defend the Act, Congress both has standing to defend the undefended statute and is a proper party to do so." Justice Scalia in his dissent, without addressing the immediate instance of BLAG's standing, wrote that Alito's theory would improperly elevate the role of the courts and substitute lawsuits initiated by Congress or the executive branch for the political process.

Maidstone Borough Council election, 2007

Background.
Before the election the Conservatives were the largest party on the council with 27 seats, compared to 20 Liberal Democrats, 4 Labour and 4 independent councillors. 20 seats were up for election, with 2 of these in Bridge and South wards being by-elections after the resignation of the previous councillors.
The Conservatives held the seats of Detling and Thurnham and Sutton Valence and Langley without a contest after no other candidates stood in those seats. In total 64 candidates stood in the election, comprising 20 Conservatives, 16 Liberal Democrats, 11 Green party, 10 Labour, 5 independents and 2 British National Party. As well as the by-elections, 2 sitting councillors did not stand in the election, Liberal Democrat John Williams from Coxheath and Hunton ward and independent Janetta Sams from Harrietsham and Lenham ward.

Overall turnout in the election was 37.68%.

Tangential speech

Tangential speech is a communication disorder in which the train of thought of the speaker wanders and shows a lack of focus, never returning to the initial topic of the conversation. It is less severe than Logorrhea and may be associated with the middle stage in dementia. It is, however, more severe than circumstantial speech in which the speaker wanders, but eventually returns to the topic.
Some adults with right hemisphere brain damage may exhibit behavior that includes tangential speech. Those who exhibit these behaviors may also have related symptoms such as seemingly inappropriate or self-centered social responses, and a deterioration in pragmatic abilities (including appropriate eye contact as well as topic maintenance).

Béla Mavrák

Béla Mavrák (April 7, 1966) is an Hungarian tenor singer.
Early life and studies.
Béla Mavrák was born in Baden bei Wien (Austria) of Hungarian parents and grew up in the city of Zrenjanin in SAP Vojvodina, SR Serbia, SFR Yugoslavia.
From an early age he followed piano lessons in the local music school. He finished the high school medicine education and was preparing for a medical university study, but during his compulsory year in the army he got more involved with music and started trying to write his own songs. After his military duty was fulfilled he asked a friend of the family who was a music professor to help him develop his composition abilities. It was this professor Bursać who first noticed Mavrák's vocal talent and who encouraged him to enroll in the Belgrade Music Academy in 1989, where he was taught by Yugoslavian tenor Zvonimir Krnetić.
At the invitation of his uncle, a saxophonist who lived in Germany, Mavrák moved to Cologne in 1991 to continue his studies there.
Alongside his education under Wilfried Jochims at the prestigious Cologne University of Music, he received private lessons by Franco Corelli in Milano and Gianni Raimondi in Bologna. He also followed master classes with Gianni Raimondi as well as with Nicolai Gedda.
In 1994, he completed his studies and received his arts diploma.
He lives in Cologne up till this day.
Career.
In 1993, Mavrák won the gold medal and first prize in the international singing competition in Santa Margherita Ligure (Italy) with Rodolfo's aria from Puccini's opera La bohème. He also sang in a CD production of Rossini's Petite messe solennelle. Following his success in Santa Margherita Ligure, the Belgrade State Opera hired him for his first operatic role, Rodolfo in the 1994 production of La bohème.
He sang in a cd production of Vivaldi's Magnificat as well as appearing in the Beethoven Hall (Bonn, Germany) together with the Philharmonica Hungarica in a production of Verdi's Requiem.
In the Cologne Philharmony he sang in the world premier of Marianna Martinez' In Exitu Israel and Dixit Dominus.
He reprised his role in the Requiem a year later in the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires and the Teatro Municipal in São Paulo (Brazil).<br>Also in 1995, he sang the main role of Faust in Berlioz' Damnation of Faust in the Salzburg Festspielhaus (Austria).
He continued this role in a new setting when the German National Theater in Weimar contracted him for two years in 1998 as part of the Weimar European Capital of Culture festivities. Over the course of these two years he starred in ten different opera productions.
Amongst his roles were those of Faust in Gounod's Faust, Don Ottavio in Mozart's Don Giovanni, Pinkerton in Puccini's Madame Butterfly and the Italian singer in Richard Strauss' Der Rosenkavalier. In 1999, still as a part of the Cultural Capital program, he sang in the European premier of Giya Kancheli's Music for the living.
1999 also saw what Mavrák considers one of the high points of his career: he sang in a concert in aid of the Menuhin Fund, conducted by Yehudi Menuhin himself.
In 2000 Mavrák, together with Gary Bennett and Thomas Greuel, became one of the three Platin Tenors.
From 2000 till 2003 Mavrák was hired as a guest singer by several German theatres. Roles from this period are amongst others: Prince Sou Chong in Lehar's The Land of Smiles, Sandor Barinkay in Johann Strauss's Der Zigeunerbaron and Edwin in Emmerich Kálmán's Die Csárdásfürstin.
He sang in the first Berlin performance of Paul McCartney's Liverpool Oratorio, in the Konzerthaus Gendarmenmarkt in 2003.
In 2004, he sang in Mendelssohn's Lobgesang in the Berlin Philharmonic Hall.
In that year he appeared more than 20 times as Tamino in The Magic Flute by Mozart.
In 2005 he sang the role of Alfredo in Verdi's La traviata in the Budapest State Opera.
Starting in 2005, Mavrák started working with André Rieu in his role as one of the Platin Tenors. Up till now they have performed more than 600 times in locations all over the world such as Semperoper in Dresden, Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna and Radio City Music Hall in New York. They also appeared in several CD and DVD productions.
In 2008, the city of Maastricht (the Netherlands) awarded Mavrák the gold honorary medal of merit, in recognition of his contributions to the city as part of André Rieu and the Strauss Orchestra.
A new direction.
In 2010, Mavrák recorded his solo CD in Cuba, Un soplo en el aire (a breeze in the wind).
During the recording of the CD in the Abdala Studio and Radio Progreso in Havana, he worked together with the Stars of Buena Vista. Amongst them are such prominent Cuban musicians as Guillermo Rubalcaba and José "Maracaibo Oriental" Castañeda. The CD was first released in Mexico in November 2010, and since then it keeps appearing in more and more countries and attracted the attention of the Universal Music Group. Mavrák has chosen for a combination of traditional Cuban songs mixed with classic Hollywood songs and more traditional songs from his childhood.

Mazda Étude

The Mazda Étude was originally a luxurious three door hatchback coupé version of the BF (fifth generation) Mazda Familia/323, only ever marketed in Japan. The name was also later used in South Africa for the seventh generation Mazda Familia.
History.
The Étude looked similar to the 323/Familia, but was a bit longer and had a lower roofline, providing a generally more suave appearance - like a 323 in a tuxedo. It was marketed as a "personal coupé" and received very full equipment (sliding sunroof, two-tone paint, power steering and windows, etc.) coupled with a more comfort oriented suspension than did sedans. The B- and C-pillars were blacked out and the greenhouse had an entirely flush surface, helping to differentiate it from its more staid siblings. This styling feature was called "Terraceback" by Mazda.
The car was first introduced in January 1987 with the 1.6-liter twin cam engine in three different trim levels, from the bottom Li via the Si to the top Gi spec. Target sales were 2,000 per month, but in the eleven months it was on sale in 1987 only about 6,000 made it onto the market. A lesser 1.5-litre base version (1.5 Sa) was added in July 1988, at which time a number of brighter colours were also added to the existing silver and white options. The Sa's spec was midway between the Li and Si. Nominally a five-seater, the rear seat was clearly designed to be comfortable for two.
Although Mazda had gone to some lengths to try to differentiate the car from the regular Familia particularly the inside felt less than special. When the Familia was redesigned in March 1989 the Étude ended production, but sales of remaining stock continued for a while. When it finally disappeared without fanfare, just under 10,000 had been built. The car's de facto successors were the Mazda Familia Astina (323F) and Autozam AZ-3/Eunos Presso coupés (known as the Mazda MX-3 in export markets).

O'Brien County Courthouse

The O’Brien County Courthouse located in Primghar, Iowa was built in 1891. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 as a part of the County Courthouses in Iowa Thematic Resource. The courthouse is the fourth building the county has used for court functions and county administration.
History.
The county’s first courthouse was a log building built on a farm for about $2,000 in 1860. It was later moved to a different location where it served as a schoolhouse, blacksmith shop and a stable. The county’s second courthouse was completed in April 1874 for about $2,000 as well. It was built in the recently established county seat of Primghar. It was replaced by the third courthouse that was built in 1887 for $6,000. The building measured 50 by 54 feet. An addition was built on to the structure in 1902 to recreate additional space for the county government. The present courthouse was completed in 1915 for $159,000. The Beaux Arts style building is three-stories tall and the exterior is clad in Bedford stone. The corridors in the interior are made of marble and the handrails in the stairways are finished in bronze.

<doc id="31112288" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31112288" title="GDP-linked bond">
GDP-linked bond

In finance, a GDP-linked bond is a debt security or derivative security in which the authorized issuer (a country) promises to pay a return, in addition to amortization, that varies with the behavior of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This type of security can be thought as a “stock on a country” in the sense that it has “equity-like” features. It pays more/less when the performance of the country is better/worse than expected. Nevertheless, it is substantially different from a stock because it there are no ownership-rights over the country. 
GDP-linked bonds are a form of floating-rate bond with a coupon that is associated with the growth rate of a country, just as other floating-rate bonds are linked to interest rates, such as LIBOR or federal funds rate, or inflation rates, which is the case of inflation-indexed bonds. These securities can be issued to reference real GDP, nominal GDP or aspects of both. In some cases, however, these securities may not have any principal claim and the notional is only used as a basis for calculating the investor's share of payments.
The term GDP-linked bond is often used interchangeably with the terms GDP-indexed bond, GDP-linked security, and GDP-indexed security in the literature. Sometimes the term warrant is used as well. This is likely because it is a relatively new asset class in which there are few real examples—the few of which were created from restructurings rather than primary issuance. There is also a variety of different ways that these instruments can be structured. For example, they can take the form of equity-like securities where payments are solely contingent on GDP growth or another extreme where they can resemble vanilla bonds with adjustments based upon GDP performance. The country will designate the classification in the instrument's indenture or prospectus.
Advantages for the issuer.
Debt service varies with ability to pay. Therefore, if a country has poor economic performance, it needs to pay less on its obligations to the investors. This means that this type of security has countercyclical features. The existence of this type of debt can reduce the probability of default because they tend to keep the debt/GDP ratios within a narrower range than fixed income bonds. 
GDP-linked bonds also act as automatic stabilizers and reduce the temptation for policymakers to spend too much in periods of high growth. In this sense this type of bond may be especially useful for developing countries where the presence of weaker institutions makes it easier for governments to implement more volatile of policies. Moreover, this type of bond allows governments to implement less volatile tax policies, since there is less need to increase taxes during times of poor economic performance because it is precisely during these times when debt repayments are lower. If we believe that agents prefer to smooth consumption across time and across states of nature then it is worth it to do so. Hence using GDP-linked bonds may be welfare improving. 
Furthermore, emerging markets are usually forced to actually undertake more austere measures in times of crises than their developed counterparts, and it is common to see that emerging markets reduce public expenditures in times of crises with the purpose of reassuring international investors. This means that countries cut their expenditures when they need it the most.
In terms of social policy it has been mentioned that GDP-linked bonds disproportionately benefit the poor because using them reduces the need to cut social benefits when economic performance is low, given that the debt repayments are lower.
For a corporate issuer or project finance issuer whose revenues will be driven by (amongst other things) GDP, to issue GDP-linked debt would leave the overall capital structure less risky.
Finally, even if this type of bond were initially thought in the context of emerging markets, they also constitute an interesting idea for developed countries.
Advantages for the investor.
For an investor who wants to purchase an income stream that rises with average incomes, but does not want the volatility of the stock market, they could be attractive. A committee in the UK which looked at where people would ideally save, concluded that ideal pensions would be linked to average incomes prior to retirement and to inflation after retirement.
These instruments also provide an investor with the opportunity to speculate on a country's increase in GDP if they have a more favorable view of the country's prospects relative to other market participants.
Disadvantages for the issuer.
GDP-linked bonds may cause political economy problems, in good times countries have to pay more to their debt holders, so citizens can potentially complain arguing that the governors contracted debt to favor the lenders. 
Another reason to worry about the charasteristics of these bonds is that they may create perverse incentives (moral hazard) to misreport growth, not revise GDP figures or even worse to repress growth.
An additional critique that has been exposed is that there are other debt instruments that could be superior in the task of insuring risk for consumers. That is, for example, the case of CPI-indexed local currency bonds. Crises are generally accompanied by large exchange rate depreciations that are driven by the fall in domestic consumption. This fall in consumption decelerates the CPI growth and in turn bonds linked to it pay less during crisis. Given that economic agents are more interested in consumption smoothing than in the stabilization of output, CPI-indexed local currency bonds may provide a better insurance against shocks than GDP-linked bonds. However, these types of bonds do not allow direct exposure to real GDP growth and only permit investors to smooth out consumption if they have a natural exposure to the CPI of the nation—such as citizens of the nation.
Disadvantages for the Investor.
There may not be a sufficient amount of participants to issue and invest in this type of security. The market has not developed in part because there are few incentives to be the first to move. Being one of the initiators in this type of market implies taking risks and undergoing a learning process that many agents are not incentivized to do. Also, more countries need to issue these types of securities so that investors are able to diversify. Given these facts, there is scope for public intervention. For example, an initiative from multilateral institutions could play the role of first mover and coordinate issuances of GDP-linked bonds from different countries. There may, thus, be a discount reflecting illiquidity.
These securities introduce investors to new forms of risks different from other sovereign instruments. Investors are exposed to the country's GDP level and growth path which may or may not be favorable. Moreover, investors may be at the mercy of the issuing country honesty with respect to economic data. The methodology for valuing these securities is also somewhat complex as these are akin to financial derivatives. Lastly, the ranking of these instruments in the case of a debt default may not be favorable as these are equity-like instruments which, as in the recent Greece and Argentina GDP linked securities, have no legal principal claim.
Historical background.
Previous to the actual issuance of GDP-linked bonds, there were some financial innovations that lead to the appearance of bonds that had features related to the economic performance of the issuing country. Mexico issued several bonds indexed to oil prices during the 1970s and later on, in the early 1990s, Mexico, Nigeria, Uruguay and Venezuela issued some Brady bonds with Value Recovery Rights (VRR), that were structured to pay higher returns when the price of certain commodities was sufficiently high. 
The first pure GDP-linked bonds were issued by Costa Rica, Bulgaria and Bosnia Herzegovina, also in the context of the Brady restructuring agreements, in the 1990s.
Greece and Argentina issued warrant-like instruments with some similarities to GDP-linked bonds as part of their recent restructurings in 2012 and 2005 respectively.
Argentina issued a GDP-linked instrument in 2002, as part of a debt-restructuring of its 2001 default. Argentina's GDP-linked instrument was issued in exchange for debt that the investors forgave in the debt default. It did not take the form of a bond, however, as it did not have any principal due associated with it. The annual dividends of the instrument can allow the investor to recoup up to 48% of the notional of the instrument provided that Argentina's GDP growth exceeded certain benchmarks over 30 years.
Greece issued a GDP-linked instrument as part of its debt default in 2012 somewhat similar to a GDP-linked bond. Under the terms of the Greek security, investors can receive only up to 1% of their notional in a given year provided that a number of conditions are met. Payments on Greece warrants, moreover, are based on a formula that only considers Greece's growth rather than the level of Greece's GDP. Finally, the payment obligations on the GDP-linked securities require Greece's GDP to attain certain levels and GDP forecasts have been falling for Greece. The Greece GDP warrants are not technically bonds as investors do not have any principal claim against the government of Greece in the event of a default.
A simple example.
Suppose a country has been growing in the last few years at an average rate of 3% and is expected to do so in the coming years. Suppose also that this country can issue debt using a fixed-income bond with a coupon of 7%. This country can issue a GDP-linked bond that pays 7% when output growth at the end of the year is exactly 3% and will pay more or less accordingly to its economic performance. That is, for example, if the country grows 1% instead of 3%, then the GDP-linked bond will pay a coupon of 5% instead of 7%. Conversely, if there is an unusually better economic performance and the country grows 5% instead of 3%, then the GDP-linked bond will pay a coupon of 9%.
Categories.
Shiller method: The value of the instrument depends on the value of GDP
Borensztein and Mauro: The return varies with the growth rate of real GDP

HAL HJT 39

__NOTOC__
The HAL HJT 39, aka CAT (Combat Air Trainer), is an Advance Jet Trainer (AJT) project proposal by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for the Indian Air Force. HAL HJT 39 CAT Programme was Announced at Aero India, February 2005, with Mockup of front fuselage and cockpit shown. It is Projected to fly within three and a half years of go-ahead with airframe and engine commonality with HAL HJT-36 Sitara, avionics comparable with those of HJT-36 and HAL Tejas. The project is currently at the advanced design stage.
Design.
CAT is Planned as a twin engine transonic “Lead in Fighter Trainer” (LIFT) with a very substantial ground attack capability with a maximum speed of 1,000 km/hr.
CAT features Multi Functional Dials (MFD) for tactical avigation, Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) and indigenous CSIO/BEL-developed Head Up Display (HUD) and Up Front Control Panel (UFCP), used on the LCA. The HUD would display both navigation and weapon aiming.
CAT also features redundancy features like stand by instrumentation system, Fly-by-Wire (FBW), hands-on-throttle-and-stick HOTAS), INS along with GPS receiver, flight control computer and display processor. The avionics would be confirming 32-bit dual mil 1553B Bus Standard.
The FBW planned consist two digital channels and one engine analog channel. Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) will be implemented for better handling. Some other features of the modern cockpit are automatic pressure cabin and temperature control systems, zero / zero ejection seat and crew emergency escape system. Radar is optional, but a new radar is to be developed.
Airframe.
Among the prominent External design features revealed are a moderately-swept wing, with no wing-body blending or wing root strakes, a prominent vertical fin. The low wing sweep will give a good low-speed performance and excellent handling characteristics essential for the trainer role.
The wing will also have a clean leading edge, while having high-lift devices on the trailing edge, for good runway performance. The HJT-39 will be an all-composite aircraft.
Cockpit.
CAT is Planned to have tandem seat configuration which lets the trainee sit in the Front Cockpit with considerable stagger between the front and rear seats.The cockpit is designed in such away that the vision for both the occupants is the maximum. The trainer has a bird’s eye view of the trainee’s action and controls.
The cockpit will a state of the art glass cockpit having Head up Display (HUD), Head down instruments and weapon aiming controls. The Ergonomics of the cockpit is another key feature of the CAT.
Engine.
In view of the ground attack requirements, it will be powered by two NPO Saturn AL-55 turbofans of 2,200 kg thrust each, compared to the 1,800 kg thrust of the variant for the single-engined HJT-36 intermediate jet trainer
Armament.
CAT features 5 hard points.The external stores with practice bombs, rockets, missiles and a gun in central fuselage.
The maximum take off weight with external stores ia projected as 9,500kg. The HJT-39 will also have a virtual training capability, with radar simulation, computerised training aids and the like. An item of optional equipment for the HJT-39 is an On-Board Oxygen Generation System (OBOGS).
HAL plans to deliver a prototype in 39 months after the clearance from the government with the project cost of Rs 750 crore. (2005)
The project is most likely shelved with no further news.
India bought Hawk 132 AJTs

Congregation of Retreat of the Sacred Heart

The Congregation of Retreat of the Sacred Heart is a Roman Catholic congregation.
Originally founded in 1678 under the name of the Institute of Retreat, at Quimper, in Brittany, by Mademoiselle Claude-Thérèse de Kerméno under the direction of the Jesuit Father Huby.
The holy foundress having made a retreat in a convent which accommodated ladies who desired to retire from the world and follow the exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola, conceived the idea of founding a similar convent at Quimper. Later the sisters took the name of the Dames de la retraite.
During the French Revolution they were dispersed for refusing to take the oath of allegiance. On 17 July 1794, one of their number, Mademoiselle Victoire de St-Luc, suffered martyrdom for her devotion to the Sacred Heart by the guillotine. Her glorious death caused the institute to flourish, the members consecrated themselves to the Sacred Heart, and in 1805 began again the work of providing retreats for seculars, interrupted in 1791.
The religious and administrative authorities in France then required the sisters to add the education of youth to their other work, and they now have large schools in various places in England, France, and Belgium.
In 1820, two sisters from Quimper opened a house at Redon (Ille-et-Vilaine), which eventually became the cradle of the Retreat of Angers. Meantime the mother-house at Quimper in 1808 opened a house at Quimperlé; in 1820, one at Lesneven (Finistère); in 1847, one at Pontchâteau (Loire-Inférieure), and in 1858, one at Brest (Finistère). The following convents were founded by the Retreat of Angers: in 1820, Redon; in 1844, Saumur (Maine-et-Loire); in 1857, a second house at Angers called l'Oratoire, and in 1893, one at Fontenay-sous-Bois (Seine).
In 1880, the sisters went to England and the flourishing convent at Clapham Park was founded from Angers. In 1882, a convent was opened at Burnham, in Somersetshire, from Quimper, and after the union of Quimper and Angers (1897), another convent was opened at Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, and in 1904, one at Clevedon. In 1898, a house at Mentone was opened, and in 1899 a large educational establishment at Brussels.
The institute and its constitutions were approved definitively by the Holy See in 1910.

Beppe Croce

Yachting: from 1969 to his death in 1986, Croce was the first non-British president of the International Sailing Federation. 
Croce was also the president of the Italian Sailing Federation (Federazione Italiana Vela) from 1957 to 1981 and of the Yacht Club Italiano from 1958 to 1986; he also was the vice president of the CONI (Comitato Olimpico Nazionale Italiano) for a long time.
In 1939 Croce won the Italian University Star Class championship, while in 1969 he won the 5.50 class Italian Championship on Lake Garda, where in 1964 he had also won a very peculiar edition of the Centomiglia regatta, finished by only three out of fifty participant boats due to the presence of very severe weather conditions.
Croce also competed in the 6 metre class at the 1948 Summer Olympics and contributed organizing the 1960 Naples sailing Olympics as the president of the Olympic Committee.
In 1952, together with his friend René Levainville, Croce founded the famous Giraglia Cup, a regatta between St. Tropez and Genova organized by the Yacht Club Italiano in collaboration with the Yacht Club de France, which nowadays involves hundreds of sailors and maxi yachts.
Croce played also a key role in the organization of the 1982 Azzurra America's Cup Challenge, the first Italian America's Cup challenge, financed by his friend and former Fiat president Gianni Agnelli; the boat competed under the patronage of the Yacht Club Costa Smeralda, founded by Karim Aga Khan. Together with Agnelli, Croce had previously visited President John Fitzgerald Kennedy in order to persuade him to accept the Italian challenge. 
After Croce's passing, a memorial celebration was held at London's Westminster Cathedral. The ceremony was attended, among others, by HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, King Constantine II of Greece, King Olaf V of Norway and Prince Aga Khan IV.
In memory of Beppe Croce, the International Sailing Federation presents every year since 1989 the prestigious ISAF Beppe Croce Trophy to an individual who has made an outstanding voluntary contribution to the sport of sailing: the roll of honour is an impressive one, including multiple Olympic medallists, rules gurus and designers. 
During his life Croce assembled a unique collection of Yacht Portrait Paintings from 1800, which adorned the walls of his house in the beloved Portofino, where he also owned the famous Hotel Splendido. 
Recently, his family gifted the Galata Museo del Mare in Genova, Croce's hometown, with more than 100 paintings from such collection, which are now permanently on show at the museum's Beppe Croce Gallery.
Personal life: Beppe Croce was raised by his grandfather Beppe Croce, after his father Luigi passed away in 1918 for a disease contracted while serving as an Army Officer in Trieste during World War I. 
Beppe's grandfather was an insurer, but also a keen sportsman and the founder of the Italian Tennis Federation (Federazione Italiana Tennis) which he presided from 1913 to 1929; he also presided the Tennis Club Genova from 1913 to 1929. The 1922 edition of the Davis Cup was held in Croce's garden in Nervi, Genova, where he had some grass courts installed for the purpose.
Beppe's other grandfather, Emilio Borzino, was the president of the Italian Liberal Party until 1927.
Beppe served as an officer during World War II; after the 1943 armistice he remained faithful to the King Vittorio Emanuele III and fought the Nazis as a liberal partisan.
From 1946 to 1980 Beppe took the presidency of Lloyd Italico, the insurance company founded by his grandfather.
Married to Countess Umberta Raggio, Croce had three sons, Luigi, Carlo and Manuela and several grandsons and great-grandsons.
Following his father's steps, Beppe's son Carlo is the actual president of the ISAF - International Sailing Federation (since 2013), of the Fiv - Italian Sailing Federation (since 2009) and of the Yacht Club Italiano (since 1997).

Robert Gray (ornithologist)

Robert Gray (15 August 1825 – 18 February 1887), was a Scottish ornithologist.
Early life.
Gray was born at Dunbar on 15 August 1825, the son of Archibald Gray, a Dunbar merchant. He was educated at the parish school.
Career.
At the age of fifteen he became an apprentice in the branch of the British Linen Company Bank. Five years afterwards he went to Glasgow, where he entered the head office of the City of Glasgow Bank. Here he attained the position of inspector of branches, an appointment which had an important influence upon his scientific pursuits. From early years he had been addicted to the study of natural history. He soon adopted ornithology as his specialty, and wrote largely on the subject. During his frequent journeys for the inspection of the branch offices of the bank, he diligently availed himself of his extended opportunities for studying bird-life and adding to his collection of specimens. The note-books, which he filled in remote country inns during evening hours, after the day's work was ended, and their illustrations by his skilful pencil, formed the basis of his ‘Birds of the West of Scotland,’ published in 1871.
Not less worthy of remembrance are Gray's labours in connection with various learned societies. In 1851 he was one of the founders of the Natural History Society of Glasgow. He contributed to the ‘Proceedings’ of that body, was its treasurer from 1854 to 1856, and was elected its secretary in 1858, a post which he resigned in 1871, when he was appointed agent of the branch of the City of Glasgow Bank in St. Vincent Street, Glasgow. On 8 April 1856 he had married Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Anderson of Girvan, a lady much interested in science, who formed an extensive and valuable geological collection illustrative of the fossils of the silurian rocks of the south of Scotland, and materially aided her husband in his ornithological pursuits. In March 1874 Gray entered the service of the Bank of Scotland as superintendent of branches, Edinburgh, and eight years later he became cashier there, an appointment which he retained during the rest of his life. 
In Edinburgh he again devoted himself to the interests of science. In 1882 he was elected vice-president of the Royal Society there; but it was in connection with the Royal Physical Society that he made his influence most distinctly felt. This society, one of the oldest scientific bodies in Edinburgh, had ‘fallen into one of its periodic fits of depression,’ when, in 1877, Gray accepted its secretaryship. He entered on his duties with great energy, and, by his courtesy and singular charm of manner not less than by his power of organisation and his excellent business faculty, he was successful in introducing needed reforms, in attracting new members and inspiriting old ones, and, finally, in placing the society upon a satisfactory footing as an active scientific body, issuing printed ‘Proceedings.’ At the time of his death, which occurred suddenly in Edinburgh on 18 February 1887, Gray was engaged, in conjunction with William Evans, upon a volume dealing with the birds of the east coast of Scotland.

Federal Drug Control Service of Russia

The Federal Drug Control Service of the Russian Federation or FSKN (in Russian:Федеральная служба Российской Федерации по контролю за оборотом наркотиков, ФСКН России) is a federal law enforcement agency of executive authority responsible for drafting state policy, legal regulation, control and monitoring in combating trafficking drugs, psychotropic substances, and their precursors. The Federal Drug Control Service of the Russian Federation is specially authorized to address and solve problems relating to traffic in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances, and their precursors; the Federal Drug Control Service is also authorized to combat the illicit drug trafficking. Commonly known as The Drugs Police (Наркополиция).
The FSKN shares concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Security Service of Russia and MVD. The FSKN also has sole responsibility for coordinating and pursuing Russian drug investigations abroad, especially in Central Asia.
History.
The first Anti-Drugs Independent Russian Agency was born in 24 September 2002 under the name "The State Committee for Combat the Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances under the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation" (UNON MVD).
In March 11, 2003 the State Committee for combat the illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances under the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation was transformed into the State Committee of Russian Federation to Monitor the Trafficking of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (GOSNARCOCONTROL). That organization eventually became the Federal Drug Control Service of Russia. Viktor Cherkesov was appointed to the chairman of the committee. The Committee passed the material base and the majority (40,000 units), staff number of the abolished Federal Tax Police Service of the Russian Federation. The Committee began its operations on July 1, 2003. 
On June 6, 2003, the Duma approved the Regulations on the State Committee of Russian Federation for the control of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. On March 9, 2004, The Russian Federal Drug Control Service was renamed the Federal Service of the Russian Federation for the control of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and on July 28, 2004, the Russian Federal Service for Control over Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances was renamed the Russian Federal Service for Drug Control. On May 12, 2008, the President of Russia dismissed Viktor Cherkesov as Director of Russian Federal Drug Control Service. On May 15, 2008, President Dmitry Medvedev appointed the former KGB general Viktor Ivanov as a Director of Russian Federal Drug Control Service.
Tasks and missions.
The main tasks of Russian Federal Drug Control Service are: 
Day of Drug Control Authorities.
In February 16, 2008 the Decree of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the day on March 11 announced the official professional holiday - the Day of Drug Control Authorities.
Criticism.
The Criticism of this law enforcement organization is related to legal collisions. For example, in 2004, the use of analgesic medication ketamine has been explicitly forbidden for use in veterinary clinics after it has been qualified as a drug of abuse. Veterinarians who sought to alleviate the suffering of animals, deliberately went to the violation of the law - as a result of a conflict between the legal and moral implications. The most "sensational" case was the process of Alexandra Duque. Criticism is also drawn by the Federal Drug Control Service supposedly rigging results of substance inspections (for example, identifying UR-144 as JWH-018 and finding drugs that were never there), improper scheduling (such as qualifying Modafinil as a cocaine substitute) and using very vague and unspecific drug analog laws
FSKN in Popular Culture.
Two famous films were made in Russia, about the Russian Federal Drug Control Service and both were paid by him:

Tyler Jakes

Tyler Jakes is an American musician, songwriter, and producer. His sound blends elements of rock and roll, blues, punk, outlaw country, gypsy folk, and surf music.
When Tyler Jakes' first album, "Lo-Fi Matter," was released in late 2005, "Pulse of the Twin Cities" drew comparisons as broad as Bob Dylan and BRMC saying that, "Jakes is intent on laying down some truly dirty rock and roll here..."Lo-Fi Matter" is a great starting point". "Rift Magazine" added, "On "Lo-Fi Matter," Jakes displays great range and talent as a song writer". The first track on "Lo-Fi Matter," "Lie Awake", was used during the opening credits to the short film "Under The N", with Jakes also performing the film's score.
Jakes moved from his home of Minneapolis, Minnesota, to San Francisco, California, in early 2008 and formed Tyler Jakes & The Bootleggers. The band featured Jakes on vocals and guitar, Nick Payne on drums, Corey Fiala on acoustic guitar and bass, Clint Taxdahl on trumpet and guitar, Matthew Whitemyer on guitar and bass, Dominic Henri on bass, and Zach LeWinter on drums and percussion. Shortly thereafter, the Emmy award-winning Discovery Channel program "Deadliest Catch" featured the song "Gamblers Off The North Pacific Shore", a song Jakes had written and recorded specifically for the show. In May 2008, Jakes released his second album, "Rocking Hoarse Calypso".
Tyler Jakes & The Bootleggers spent the remainder of 2008 and 2009 performing on a regular basis in the San Franscisco bay area, as well as touring the west coast. Highlights included shows opening up for Th' Legendary Shack Shakers, performing at the Baxtalo Drom Festival, and playing the Bob Dylan after-party at Blakes On Telegraph in Berkeley, CA.
On November 4, 2010, Jakes released his third album, "Burning Down The Underground". Jakes recorded the album primarily at his home studio in San Francisco, with bandmate, Matthew Whitemyer, co-engineering. "The Music Cycle" wrote, ""Burning Down The Underground" stays true to the deep bluesy rock sound that has come to garner Jakes such critical acclaim. At the same time, however, Jakes continues to push the boundaries of sound and genre creating unique and interesting fusions of music".

Undercover Boss Norge

Undercover Boss is a 2011 Norwegian reality television series, based on the British series of the same name. Each episode depicts a person who has a high management position at a major business, deciding to become undercover as a entry-level employee to discover the faults in the company. The first series premiered on 8 March 2011 with the CEO of the grocery store chain Rimi.
Format.
Each episode features a high-ranking executive or the owner of a corporation going undercover as an entry-level employee in their own company. The executives alter their appearance and assume an alias and fictional back-story. The fictitious explanation given for the accompanying camera crew is that the executives are being filmed as part of a documentary about entry-level workers in a particular industry. They spend approximately one week undercover, working in various areas of their company operations, with a different job and in most cases a different location each day. They are exposed to a series of predicaments with amusing results, and invariably spend time getting to know the people who work in the company, learning about their professional and personal challenges.
At the end of their week undercover, the executives return to their true identity and request the employees they worked with individually to corporate headquarters. The bosses reveal their identity, and reward hard-working employees through campaign, promotion, or financial rewards, while other employees are given training or better working conditions.
Episodes.
The first series featured 10 episodes. The series premiered on 8 March 2011 and concluded on 10 May 2011.

Henry Thomas Ellacombe or Ellicombe (1790-1885), was an English divine and antiquary.
Life.
Ellacombe was the son of the Rev. William Ellicombe, rector of Alphington, Devonshire, was born in 1790, and having graduated R.A. from Oriel College, Oxford, in 1812, applied himself until 1816 to the study of engineering in Chatham Dockyard, under the direction of Marc Brunel. In 1816 be proceeded to the degree of M.A., and was ordained for the curacy of Cricklade, a Wiltshire parish in the diocese of Gloucester. In the following year, having been ordained as a priest, he removed to Bitton, Gloucestershire, in the same diocese. He held the curacy till 1835, when he became the vicar. In 1850 he was presented to the rectory of Clyst St George, Devonshire, being succeeded in his former benefice by his son, the Rev. Canon Henry Nicholson Ellacombe (1822-1916), who was a distinguished gardening writer and mentor to the great plantsman E.A. Bowles. 
Ellacombe died at Clyst St. George, 30 July 1885, and was buried in the churchyard of Bitton.
Works.
In spite of many difficulties, Ellacombe restored the church of Bitton in 1822, and built three other churches in the wide district under his care, including Christ Church, Hanham, which was constructed under his immediate supervision. In 1843 his parishioners presented him with a testimomal, and in doing so the churchwardens stated that he had been the means of providing church accommodation in the district for 2,285 worshippers, and schoolrooms for 820 children. After his removal to Clyst St. George he rebuilt the nave of the church, and in 1860 erected a school-house and master's residence.
Ellacombe was the great authority on bells, upon which he wrote some valuable treatises. He invented a device, now known as an Ellacombe apparatus, with chiming hammers, to enable one person to chime all the bells in a steeple. He was a learned antiquary, and a skilful florist and botanist.

Karl Grün

Karl Grün (; 30 September 1817 – 18 February 1887), also known by his alias Ernst von der Haide, was a German journalist, political theorist and socialist politician. He played a prominent role in radical political movements leading up to the Revolution of 1848 and participated in the revolution. He was an associate of Heinrich Heine, Ludwig Feuerbach, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Karl Marx, Mikhail Bakunin and other radical political figures of the era. Though less widely known today, Grün was an important figure in the German "Vormärz", Young Hegelian philosophy and the democratic and socialist movements in nineteenth century Germany. As a target of Marx' criticism, Grün played a role in the development of early Marxism; through his philosophical influence on Proudhon, he had a certain influence on the development of French socialist theory.
Young Hegelianism, 'True Socialism' and early activism.
Karl Theodor Ferdinand Grün was born in Lüdenscheid, a Westphalian town then under Prussian control. His father was a schoolmaster. His younger brother, Albert Grün, was a poet who later gained some notoriety for his role in the Revolution of 1848–49. While a secondary student at Wetzlar, Grün became involved in radical political activism, helping produce and distribute illegal democratic pamphlets. From 1835 to 1838 he studied philology and theology at the University of Bonn and philology and philosophy at the University of Berlin, where he completed a doctorate. One of Grün's fellow students was Karl Marx. Grün and Marx frequented the radical philosophical circles of the Young Hegelians and were strongly influenced by the 'humanistic materialism' of Ludwig Feuerbach. Marx' rivalry with Grün subsequently led to a personal breach between them. Grün was also strongly influenced by contemporary French socialist theories, combining them with Young Hegelian and Feuerbachian philosophy and democratic politics. He was associated with the group of 'True Socialists' around Moses Hess, a Young Hegelian philosopher and forerunner of labour Zionism. (Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels sharply criticized the 'True Socialists' as utopian crypto-idealists.) Grün was also acquainted with several figures of the "Vormärz" period—the period of radical political ferment leading up to the abortive March Revolution of 1848—such as Arnold Ruge, Bruno Bauer, Heinrich Heine, Georg Herwegh and others. 
Grün argued that humans are material beings who are by nature social and need the community of others to survive. From Feuerbach he adopted the thesis that the idea of God is merely an alienated representation of human sociality or 'species being', reflecting the alienating and unjust character of actual human social conditions. Unlike Feuerbach, whose socialism was largely passive, Grün called for a 'philosophy of action', because the spiritual alienation of humanity in religion can only be overcome if the political-economic alienation of human beings from each other in society is overcome by means of revolutionary action. Like many Young Hegelians, Grün saw as parallel and complementary the development of socialist theory in France and the revolution of critical philosophy in Germany. Grün followed Hess and the 'True Socialists' in claiming that the struggle for human emancipation could not be successful unless critical philosophy became socialist and socialism were infused with philosophical criticism. (Marx came to reject this view as giving undue priority to ideology over material substructure.)
Grün returned to Germany in 1842. His radical journalism, advocating democracy and professing republican and socialist sympathies, and his known association with radical political circles, made an academic career impossible. The University of Marburg even refused to have Grün as a post-doctoral student, and the Prussian authorities placed him on a list of 'political criminals'. He was expelled from several German states and lived in a number of cities over the next few years (most extensively in Cologne), supporting himself by means of journalism, giving lectures on literary topics and working as a school teacher. In democratic circles he enjoyed a certain celebrity. He contributed to, and edited, a number of radical publications, including the newspaper "Der Sprecher" ('The Speaker') and the monthly journal "Bielefelder Monatsschrift". Many of these publications were eventually outlawed by the authorities. In 1843, Grün (along with Marx, Hess and others) participated in the controversy over Bruno Bauer's essay 'The Jewish Question', which opposed civil rights for Jews. Grün rejected Bauer's position.
Exile, revolution, exile.
In 1844, impecunious, under pressure from the censorship and fearing arrest, Grün once again went into exile. He first moved to Brussels, where he associated with the radical poet Ferdinand Freiligrath and once again crossed paths with Marx. Having been expelled by the Belgian government, along with Marx and other German refugees, he settled in Paris. There Grün befriended the anarchist philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, whose writings had greatly influenced him and whose ideas he helped popularize among German radicals. In turn, Grün was instrumental in introducing Proudhon to Hegelian, Young Hegelian and Feuerbachian philosophy. Another acquaintance was the Russian exile Mikhail Bakunin, who had been involved in Young Hegelian circles in Russia and Germany in the 1830s and 1840s and was also living in Paris. In 1845, Grün published a noteworthy early history of socialism in the francophone world, "Die sozialen Bewegungen in Frankreich und Belgien". Grün's exile was marked by great financial difficulty. In addition to his journalism, he worked for some time as a printer.
In February 1848, Grün enthusiastically welcomed the French revolution against King Louis-Philippe and the establishment of the Second Republic. A month later, the revolution spread to several German states, and Grün returned to Germany. He settled in Trier, becoming a leading member of the local 'Democratic Club' and resuming his political journalism. In 1849 he won a by-election in Wittlich and sat as a deputy of the extreme left in the Prussian National Assembly. As the Revolution began to lose momentum, the Prussian government decided to dissolve the Assembly. Grün helped organize and spoke at a large protest rally, which led to a local insurrection and an attempt to storm the arsenal at Prüm. Though he did not participate in the storming of the arsenal, Grün was charged with 'intellectual responsibility' for the uprising and imprisoned. Upon his release, he once again went into exile. He returned to Brussels because he bitterly opposed the régime of Louis Bonaparte (Napoléon III), whose thinly veiled caesarian ambitions were confirmed by the "coup d'état" of December 1852. Grün lived in Brussels from 1850 to 1861, working mainly as a private tutor and writing polemics against Napoléon III. In 1859 he gave lectures at the University of Brussels.
Amnesty, literature and democratic politics.
In 1861, an amnesty enabled Grün to return to Prussian territory. Over the next few months he travelled widely, giving lectures and attending the opening of the National Assembly of the newly unified Italian state in 1861. In 1862 he settled in Frankfurt, where he taught history of literature at the Polytechnic. He also wrote for the "Neue Frankfurter Zeitung". In 1865 he moved to Heidelberg. Grün remained politically active, becoming involved in the democratic 'People's Party' (one of the forerunners of the German Social-Democratic Party) and opposing Prussian ambitions to establish hegemony in Germany. In the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 he took an anti-Prussian stance, not out of sympathy for Hapsburg imperial pretensions but out of hostility to Hohenzollern ambitions. In 1867 he attended the international Congress of the League of Peace and Freedom in Geneva, along with such luminaries as John Stuart Mill, Bakunin and Giuseppe Garibaldi. Prussia having won the war against Austria, Grün moved to Vienna in 1868, where he remained for the rest of his life. There he edited the periodical "Democratic Correspondence" and gave lectures on literature, art and philosophy. His publications during these years included an edition of the correspondence and posthumous writings of his mentor Ludwig Feuerbach, a two-volume philosophical biography of Feuerbach, a book-length critique of F.A. Lange's noted treatise on materialist philosophy and several other works on philosophy, art, literature and history. In 1871, Grün welcomed the uprising of the Paris Commune. In the 1870s he supported the creation of workers' educational circles, which became one of the sources of the Austrian socialist party (founded after Grün's death). Grün died in Vienna.
Albert Grün (1822–1904).
Karl Grün's younger brother Albert Grün also played a role in the democratic and socialist circles of the 1830s and 1840s. 
Albert Grün was born in Lüdenscheid on May 31, 1822. He became politically active as early as 1836, at the age of 14. Under the influence of his brother Karl, Albert Grün became involced in illegal democratic circles, associated with the Young Hegelians and absorbed the philosophy of Feuerbach and the doctrines of the French socialists, Fourier, Proudhon, etc. He contributed to several radical publications and in 1846 was condemned for "lèse majesté". He escaped to Brussels, where he gave lectures on modern drama.
During the 1848 revolution he returned to Germany. In Berlin he organized one of the earliest German labour unions, the 'Machine Builders' Association'. In 1849 Albert Grün played a role in the revolutionary Provisional Government of Saxony and in the armed uprisings in the Palatinate and in Baden. He was sentenced to death for his role in the Badensian revolution but escaped to the Alsatian capital of Strasbourg, France. There he gave lectures on literature and worked as a school teacher. Although Grün received an amnesty in the 1860s, he remained in Strasbourg. In 1871, as a result of the Franco-Prussian War, Germany annexed Alsace, but Grün was not molested.
Grün continued to work as a teacher and tutor in various capacities. He was a member of the General Association for the German Language and worked for a reconciliation of the French and German nations. He also supported the German Social-Democratic party. Albert Grün published a variety of books on historical, political and literary topics. He died in Strasbourg on April 22, 1904.

Earthquake map

In hyperbolic geometry, an earthquake map is a method of changing one hyperbolic manifold into another, introduced by .
Earthquake maps.
Given a simple geodesic on an oriented hyperbolic manifold and a real number "t", one can cut the manifold along the geodesic, slide the edges a distance "t" to the left, and glue them back. This gives a new hyperbolic manifold, and the (possibly discontinuous) map between them is an example of a left earthquake. 
More generally one can do the same construction with a finite number of disjoint simple geodesics, each with a real number attached to them. The result is called a simple earthquake.
An earthquake is roughly a sort of limit of simple earthquakes, where one has an infinite number of geodesics, and instead of attaching a positive real number to each geodesic one puts a measure on them.
A geodesic lamination is of a hyperbolic surface is a closed subset with a foliation by geodesics. A left earthquake "E" consists of a map between copies of the hyperbolic plane with geodesic laminations, that is an isometry from each stratum of the foliation to a stratum. Moreover if "A" and "B" are two strata then "E""E" is a hyperbolic transformation whose axis separates "A" and "B" and which translates to the left, where "E""A" is the isometry of the whole plane that restricts to "E" on "A", and likewise for "B".
Earthquake theorem.
Thurston's earthquake theorem states that for any two points "x", "y" of Teichmüller space there is a unique left earthquake from "x" to "y". It was proved by William Thurston in a course in Princeton in 1976-1977, but at the time he did not publish it, and the first published statement and proof was given by , who used it to solve the Nielsen realization problem.

2011 African Cross Country Championships

The 1st African Cross Country Championships was an international cross country running competition for African athletes which was held on 6 March 2011 in Cape Town, South Africa. Organised by the Confederation of African Athletics, it marked the start of a new continental competition for Africa following the decision by the IAAF to alter the scheduling of the World Cross Country Championships from every year to a biennial format.
The event consisted of four race categories, featuring senior and junior races for men and women. The Kenyan athletes took a complete sweep of the competition, winning all the individual medals and the four team titles. Mercy Cherono, a former World Junior Champion, took the women's senior title while the less well-known John Mwangangi won the men's senior race. Japhet Korir and Caroline Chepkoech won the men's and women's junior gold medals, respectively. Sigosi Chesonane, representing the host nation, was the only non-Kenyan to reach the top five in an event, finishing fifth in the men's senior race.
Although Kenya dominated the competition, none of its runners at the African event ran at the 2011 IAAF World Cross Country Championships two weeks later. Athletics Kenya sent the best performers at that year's Kenya Cross Country Championships to the world event, while those ranking seventh to tenth in the national race were sent to the event in Cape Town. The continent's second foremost nation in cross country, Ethiopia, did not send any athletes to the competition.
The Kenyan team's jubilant celebrations led to the entire squad of 30 runners and officials missing their flight for Nairobi, scheduled later that day at Cape Town International Airport.

Delhi Directorate of Education

Delhi Directorate of Education (abbreviated Del E) is the department under the education ministry of Delhi Government that manages the city's public school system. It is one of the India's largest school education system. Delhi government has made several efforts for the growth of education in Delhi. Recognizing the importance of education, the Govt. of Delhi is spending about 10%
its total plan allocation on Education Sector. The share of the Education Sector (General Education, Technical Education, Art & Culture and Sports) in total Plan expenditure of Delhi Government for last 5 years is increased from 8.49% in 2004-05 up to 10.32% in 2008-09
History.
In 1973 "Delhi School Education Act" was passed in the assembly, according to which responsibility for Pre-primary and primary level of education in Delhi was given to local bodies like MCD, NDMC and Delhi Cantonment Board; and Directorate of Education was made responsible for secondary and senior secondary level of education. In 1980-81, Delhi had 704 secondary/senior secondary schools, which increased to 1759 in 2007-08. Students enrollment also increased from 254,000 in 1980-81 to 793,000 in 2007-08. Because of the space constraint, the majority of Sarvodaya Vidyalayas were made to operate in two different shifts - a morning shift for girls and an evening shift for boys. Due to the high growth rate of the Delhi's population and shortage of infrastructure, Directorate of Education had also introduced primary classes in its 364 "Sarvodaya Vidyalayas".
Departments of DoE.
Directorate of Education divides Delhi region into 12 districts and 28zones with hierarchy from district to zones. Each district consist one or more zones in it with "District Education Officer" as the head of education, similarly each zone has "Zonal Education Officer" to command the education department of zonal level.
Demographics.
In Delhi public schools the total school enrollment for boys is higher than females. In 2007-08 163,500 girls were enrolled accounting to 46.82% of total enrollment as compared to 185,700 enrollments of boys.
Infrastructure Development.
Delhi's public schools were never been popular for their good infrastructure, for many years majority of the Delhi's school even didn't have proper school buildings which forced the students to attend the classes in open or in temporary tin-shades. But since last 15 years the conditions have changed and with the efforts of Directorate of Education, many schools have received well architecturally developed state-of-the-art buildings and other infrastructures. The DoE has engaged the "Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation" (DSIIDC) and the "Public Works Department" (PWD) for this upgradation and refurbishment.
Growth of education in public schools.
The total pass percentage of Delhi's public schools students in the C.B.S.E. examinations is increasing per annual basis. The total students dropout rate from schools has been come down from 17.5% to 5.7%. The pass percentage growth rate of Delhi's secondary and senior schools is as follow:-
Controversies and criticisms.
Despite several reforms employed by the Directorate of Education, still a large proportion of Delhi is either illiterate or just have primary level of education. Government has been praised itself for its policies and high pass percentage of public schools in board examinations but still condition of Delhi public schools is not as comparable as private institutions. Thousands of posts for teachers, academic staff and principals of many public schools are still vacant; for which even the Supreme Court of India has also been criticized Delhi government.
Even after the passing of Right to Education bill by Indian Government in April, 2010, which made education as one of the fundamental right of Indian citizens and made it free and compulsory for the age group of 6 to 14; over 10,000 violations of this act were found in Delhi up to December, 2010, in which many of cases were in which students were denied admission to school, some were subjected to corporal punishment by the school authorities and yet many of the private schools denied to implement special "Economically Weaker Section (EWS) Quota", made by the Delhi government for the benefits of the poorer students of Delhi.

John Ella

John Ella (1802-1888) was an English violinist and director of concerts.
Early life.
Ella was born at Thirsk 19 December 1802. He was intended by his father, Richard Ella, for the law; but in 1819 he was taught the violin by M. Fémy. On 18 January 1821 he made his first appearance as a professional musician in the orchestra of Drury Lane Theatre. In the following year he was promoted to the band of the King's Theatre.
In 1826, on the completion of his musical education under Thomas Attwood, and subsequently under François-Joseph Fétis in Paris, that he took his place as a member of major orchestras of London, such as the Philharmonic and the Ancient Concerts. The Saltoun Club of Instrumentalists and the Società Lirica were perhaps founded by him as early as this period of his life. They were intended for the practice and performance of unfamiliar operatic music. He played in the orchestra on the occasion of Carl Maria von Weber's funeral, 21 June 1826. Around this time he was appointed to a subordinate post at the Royal Academy of Music, and became musical editor of the "Athenæum" and other papers.
The Musical Union.
In 1830 he seems to have given public concerts under the patronage of Augustus FitzGerald, 3rd Duke of Leinster. During his journeys to the continent he made the acquaintance of musical celebrities. The set of chamber concerts which he inaugurated, under the name of the "Musical Union", and which originated in a weekly meeting at his own house, had an effect on public taste, particularly through its successor, the Popular Concerts. By the formation of an aristocratic committee, and by making the concerts in some measure social gatherings, for which tmembership could only be obtained by personal introduction, he secured for his scheme a high prestige. The programme always contained at least two concerted instrumental works and the executants were generally artists of established position, many of whom had not appeared before in England. The annual series consisted of eight afternoon concerts given during the season, at first in Willis's Rooms, and a benefit concert when vocal music was allowed to form part of the programme. The artists played in the middle of the room, with the audience surrounding them, and programmes were printed and sent out to the subscribers a few days before the concert. The undertaking met with such support that a series of evening concerts, at somewhat lower prices, was started in the early part of 1852, under the title of "Musical Winter Evenings". 
In 1858 both sets of concerts were transferred to Hanover Square Rooms, and in the following year to the newly opened St James's Hall. In the same year, the Monday Popular Concerts having been set on foot, Ella's evening series was given up. His title of professor was derived from a post at the London Institution. He was honorary member of the Philharmonic Academy of Rome, and of the Philharmonic Society of Paris.
Later life.
The Musical Union ceased to exist in 1880, when Ella gave up active work. For the last twenty years of his life he lived at 9 Victoria Square, London, where he died 2 October 1888, after repeated attacks of paralysis. For some years before his death he had been totally blind. He was buried in Brompton Cemetery 5 October.
Works.
He wrote a "Victoria March" in November 1837, almost his only experiment as a composer. In 1855 he was appointed musical lecturer to the London Institution, and the substance of three lectures on melody, harmony, and counterpoint was given in the "Musical Union Record", i.e. the programmes. A set of four lectures on dramatic music was also published (1872). In 1869 he published "Musical Sketches Abroad and at Home", a volume of anecdotes, autobiographical and otherwise, bearing on music. The book ran through two editions, and a third, edited by the author's friend John Belcher was published in 1878. A "Personal Memoir of Meyerbeer, with Analysis of "Les Huguenots"" is Ella's other important contribution to musical literature.

Simon Awad

Simon VII Awad (or Sim'an Awwad, "Auwad", "Aouad", , ), 1683–1756, was the Maronite Patriarch of Antioch from 1743 to his death in 1756.
Life.
Simon Awad was born in 1683 in Hasroun, Lebanon. From 1696 to 1707 he studied in Rome and at his return in Lebanon, on June 10, 1708, he was ordained as a priest by his uncle patriarch Jacob Awad, who reigned from 1705 to 1733, and whom he served as secretary. On January 27, 1716 he was consecrated bishop of Damascus, always by his uncle. Simon Awad played a leading role in the 1736 Maronite Synod of Mount-Lebanon.
At the death of Patriarch Joseph Khazen, who died on May 13, 1742, the bishops who attended the funeral met and elected Simon Awad as Patriarch, but Simon refused out of humility. So the bishops elected the bishop of Arka, Elias Mohasseb. Bishops Tobias El Khazen and Ignace Chrabai were absent from the meeting, perhaps not invited, and opposed the election of Elias. These two bishops ordained two new bishops and held a new election among themselves, electing Tobias El Khazen as Patriarch and splitting the Church. To keep the Church united, Pope Benedict XIV took the extraordinary initiative to deal directly in the affairs of the Maronite Church, and on March 16, 1743 he chose Simon Awad in place of the two pretenders. This decision was communicated to a synod of all the Maronite bishops held on October 7, 1743 and was unanimously accepted. Thus Simon Awad was enthroned patriarch on October 11, 1743 and he received the pallium from the Pope on July 3, 1744.
Simon Awad summoned a Maronite synod on November 28–30, 1755 at Qannubin Monastery to implement the decrees of the 1736 Maronite Synod of Mount-Lebanon. The synod issued fifteen canons, but they did not fully implement the 1736 Maronite Synod decrees. The other main issue of Simon's patriarchate was the visionary nun Hindiyya al-'Ujaimi, who soon became opposed by the Jesuits. Simon ordered initially an internal investigation, and based on its results he sided with Hindiyya. The complaints against the nun went on anyway, and on 1752 Pope Benedict XIV ordered an inspection, carried out by a Franciscan, Desiderio da Casabasciana, who, initially hostile, became himself a supporter of Hindiyya. The case of Hindiyya endured under the next two patriarchs.
Simon Awad died on February 12, 1756 in El-Midane (Jezzine District) where he lived most of his life and where he founded the monastery of the Lady of Machmoucheh, in which he was buried.
Works.
Simon Awad is remembered as an Arab writer. His main works are:

Rodent to Stardom

Rodent to Stardom is a 1967 "Looney Tunes" animated short starring Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales. It is the first cartoon to credit Warner Bros. "Seven Arts", but still uses the "Abstract WB" titles.
Plot.
Daffy is plucked for stardom by director Harvey Hassenpfeffer of Colossal Studios—or so he thinks. However, as he was in "A Star Is Bored" (1956), Daffy's real fate is to be the stunt man for the star, in this case Speedy Gonzales. The picture is "The Nursery Rhyme Review". First, "the sky is falling"; next, the "rockabye baby" cradle falls from a treetop. Daffy realizes he needs to get rid of Speedy, so he asks for an autograph and traps Speedy in a book, which he deposits in a library. Daffy gets the love scene with Ducky Lamour, but after a number of stunts and just before the kiss, his stand-in, Speedy, takes over.

Hermosa Beach, California is where Tomorrows Bad Seeds was formed. The band was formed by lead singer, Moises Juarez and guitar player and turntablist Mathew McEwan in 2004. Later, Johnny McEwan, Mat's cousin joined the band as their drummer. Soon after they met their bass player Al Arnado who later left the band to take a job as a longshoreman, so they recruited Andre Davis to fill his spot., while playing a show the band ran into fellow musician Sean Chapman, they had known him in high school, so the band pulled him in and he joined as the fifth member playing guitar and singing vocals.
The band's name came from a graffiti crew they had grown up around called TBS, they used the acronym to come up with Tomorrows Bad Seeds wanting to stay true to their roots. The band started out by playing in local bars and friends back yards but got lucky (despite their undeveloped sound) in 2007 when the band signed with UrbanTone Records, an independent record label as a vehicle to spread their sound. The band released their debut album "Early Prayers" in June 2007, featuring the singles Rhyme & Reason, Vices, Warrior Poet and Love Street, making mediocre sales on iTunes reggae chart. In 2007 the band toured all over Hawaii on four separate tours throughout Kona and Hilo. The response was mixed. In 2009 Tomorrows Bad Seeds covered the United States playing at venues like House of Blues (Hollywood), Vault 350, Knitting Factory, Key Club, Galaxy Theatre, the world famous Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood).
In the midst of all the touring and recording throughout 2009 Johnny McEwan left the band halfway through recording their second album making it on seven tracks and replaced by Andre's friend Pat Salmon who made it on four tracks finishing the album. On May 25, 2010, Tomorrows Bad Seeds released their second album "Sacred For Sale". Following the CD release of their second album the band was added on to Warped Tour 2010 and played on the Skullcandy stage. On August 18, 2010 the band shut down the Roxy theatre for the Sunset Music Festival. Following up with a co-headlining tour with Passafire. On November 18, 2010 Tomorrows Bad Seeds were honored with the Commercial Success Award at the Los Angeles Music Awards for having reached over 150,000 downloads for the 2010 year.
On December 2, 2010, Tomorrows Bad Seeds headlined their Holidaze Acoustic Tour all across California, each show was a one of a kind performance, providing a different line up of TBS hits. The band closed down 2010 on New Year's Eve with a headlining show @ BriXton in Redondo Beach, California. On January 9 and 10, 2011 the band filmed their first music video for “Reflect”. Two days later on January 12, 2011 Tomorrows Bad Seeds filmed a national T.V. performance for "The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson" which aired March 3, 2011, they performed “Only For You” off their second album “Sacred For Sale." 
On August 8, 2011 the band released their new single "Nice & Slow". This single charted as number 1 on CDbaby Reggae chart upon release. TBS worked with their sponsor Body Glove to create the perfect summer video to accompany the new single. The "Nice & Slow video won MTVU Video Of The Week and was added to rotation on October 14, 2011. On November 29, 2011 TBS headed into the Village Studios to record their third album "The Great Escape" with Grammy Winner and seven time nominee Damon Elliot. Their first single off the album "One Way" Co-written with established song writer/bass player Tim Myers climbed its way on to the Billboard Indicator Charts.
In 2014 Moi, Sean & Mets started a side project called LIFE
Music style and influence.
Since most the group grew up in the South Bay, they were highly influenced by the reggae, rock, punk culture and bands like Sublime, Pepper, Pennywise among others. After releasing both records TBS has established the band's sound as a fusion of rock, reggae, ska punk, surf-rock, hip-hop and blues all which were developed through studio time, jam sessions and live shows.

Autism and working memory

Autism is a disorder of neural development characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. It affects an estimated 6 in 1000 people. Autism is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum (ASDs), the other two being Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met. In this article, the word "autism" is used for referring to the whole range of disorders on the autism spectrum, which is not uncommon.
Working memory is the system that actively holds multiple pieces of transitory information in the mind, where they can be manipulated. This system has a limited capacity. Working memory is a part of the executive functions (EF), an umbrella term for cognitive processes that regulate, control, and manage other cognitive processes, for instance planning and attention.
A majority of the research has found that individuals with autism perform poorly on measures of executive function. A general decrease in working memory (WM) is one of the limitations, although some studies have found that working memory is not impaired in autistic children relative to controls matched for IQ. However, some evidence suggests that there may be minimal impairment in high-functioning autistic (HFA) individuals in that they have intact associative learning ability, verbal working memory, and recognition memory. In rare cases there are even instances of individuals possessing extremely good memory in constricted domains which are typically characterized as savants. Bennetto, Pennington and Rogers also suggest that WM deficits and limited EF is likely compounded by the onset of autism where early development yields hindrances in social interaction which typically (i.e. without impairment) improves both WM and EF. However, due to limited ability in interpreting social gestures and an impaired ability to process such information in a holistic and comprehensive manner, individuals with autism are subject to diminished and confounding instances of memory function and performance.
Physiological underpinnings.
The physical underpinnings of the cause for differences in the working memory of autistic people has been studied. Bachevalier suggests a major dysfunction in the brain of an autistic individual resides in the neural mechanisms of the structures in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and perhaps, more specifically the amygdaloid complex. This may have implications in their ability to encode information because of the role the MTL and especially the hippocampal areas play in information processing DeLong reinforces this by suggesting autism to have an impact on hippocampal function. Because the hippocampus is pivotal in memory encoding and modulating memory consolidation, any impairment can drastically impact an autistic individual's ability to process (i.e. multi-modal) and retain information. Sumiyoshi, Kawakubo, Suga, Sumiyoshi and Kasai have suggested that it is possible that the attenuated neural activities in parahippocampal regions might have something to do with the abnormal organization of information of individuals within the autistic spectrum. The left parahippocampal region (including the parahippocampal gyrus) has an implied role in sorting, relating, and sending information to the hippocampus and thus any abnormal activity or dysfunction within these regions might be accountable for the degree of effectiveness autistic individuals organize information. This is in keeping with other findings that suggest unconventional activity or lack of activity within the hippocampal regions which have a role in explaining some aspects of ASD.
Further evidence suggests that there is abnormal circuitry in what Brothers calls the neural basis for social intelligence, or holistically interpreting people's expressions and intentions. The interaction between the amygdala, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and the superior temporal sulcus and gyrus (STG) enables one to process social information for personal interaction. In the case of autistic individuals there seems to be a limitation in these structures such that facial expressions, body language and speech expressions (ex. sarcasm) go consciously unnoticed. However, Frith and Hill suggest that through 'remediation' or training that attends to specific traits in expressions, social understanding can be partially improved.
Characteristics.
Global working memory characteristics.
Beversdorf finds that because autistic individuals are not as reliant on contextual information (i.e. comparing typically related schemas) to aid in memory consolidation, they are less likely to rely on semantically similar cues (ex. Doctor-Nurse vs. Doctor-Beach). Thus, an autistic individual would fare well on discriminating and recalling accurate items from false items.
Bennetto, Pennington and Rogers investigated the degree of cognitive impairment in autistic individuals with an emphasis on illuminating the latency in executive functioning. Findings suggested a hindrance in temporal order, source, free recall and working memory. However, their participants did exhibit capable short and long term memory, cued recall and the capacity to learn new material. In sum, they suggested that there is both a general deficit in global working memory and a specific impairment in social intelligence where the former is exacerbated by the latter and vice versa.
Other evidence points towards unique mnemonic strategies used by autistic individuals wherein they rely less on semantic associative networks and are less constricted by conventional word-word associations (ex. Orange-Apple). This may be due to abnormalities in MTL regions. Thus, autistic individuals may have the capacity for more abstract but robust associations. Firth addresses this with the term “weak Central Coherence”, meaning a reduced tendency for processing information in context and integration of higher-level meaning. This may explain why autistic individuals have a heightened capacity for noticing seemingly disjointed details. For example, in the Embedded Figures Test (EFT) autistic individuals exhibited a heightened ability to locate the target because of their diminished reliance on global perception.
In a study conducted on autistic children, it was shown that neurocognition influences word learning in autistic children. The process of syntactic development requires a child to match co-occurrences of words or parts of words (morphemes) and their meanings. This process can depend on working memory. The limited short term verbal memory paired with working memory may be the reason of language delay in children with autism. According to the result of this experiment the group with autism was able to perform the part of the test with nonlinguistic cues which depended on working memory but failed to pass short term memory and the linguistic part of it. This explains the delay of language in autistic children and neurocognition is an important contributor to it.
Central executive or executive functioning.
Autism spectrum disorders are thought to be caused in part by dysfunction of the working memory. In examining autism through the lens of Baddeley & Hitch’s model of working memory there have been conflicting results in research. Some studies have shown that individuals that fall within the spectrum have impaired executive functioning, that is, working memory does not function correctly and thus these individuals have less cognitive flexibility and reduced inhibition within working memory. However, other studies have failed to find an effect in autistic people with a high level of functioning. Tests such as the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test have been administered to autistic individuals and the lower scores have been interpreted as indicative of a poor ability to focus on relevant information and thus a deficit within the central executive aspect of working memory. An interesting aspect of ASD is that it might be present, to a certain extent, in first degree relatives. One study found that siblings of individuals with autism have limited ability to focus and conceptualize categories using updated information. Given these results, it is reasonable to suggest that these so-called deficits in cognitive ability are of the cognitive endophenotypes (i.e. relatives) of ASD.
Category integration.
Given these findings it would appear as if autistic individuals have trouble categorizing. Studies have shown that category induction is in fact possible and can occur at the same cognitive level as non-autistic individuals, however. Given that category formation aspects such as discrimination and feature detection are enhanced amongst autistic individuals it is viable to state that although autistic individuals require more trials and or time to learn material, and also may employ different learning strategies than non-autistic individuals, once learned, the level of categorization displayed is on par with a non-autistic individual.
The idea that autistic individuals employ a different style of learning than people who do not fall in the spectrum can account for the delay in categorization but the resulting average level of cognitive ability. This, however, is only applicable to higher functioning individuals within the spectrum as those with lower IQ levels are notoriously difficult to test and measure.
In part with a different style of learning, individuals within the spectrum have also been proposed to have a weak central coherence. This theory meshes well with the general traits of individuals within the spectrum. Again though, this is explained through different learning styles. As opposed to viewing a forest as a collection of trees, those with autism see one tree, and another tree, and another tree and thus it takes an immense amount of time to process complex tasks in comparison with non-autistic people). Weak central coherence can be used to explain what is viewed as a working memory deficit in attention or inhibition, as autistic individuals possess an intense focus on single parts of a complex, multi-part concept and cannot inhibit this in order to withdraw focus and direct it on the whole rather than a singular aspect. Thus, this suggests that the decrement in working memory is partially inherited which is then exacerbated by further genetic complications leading to a diagnosis of autism.
Visual and spatial memory.
Deficits in spatial working memory appear to be familiar in people with autism, and probably even in their close relatives. Replication of movements by others, a task that requires spatial awareness and memory capacities, can also be difficult for autistic children and adults.
People with Asperger's Syndrome were found to have spatial working memory deficits compared with control subjects on the Executive-Golf Task, although these may be indicative of a more general deficit in non-verbal intelligence in people with ASD. Despite these results, autistic children have been found to be superior to typically developing children in certain tasks, such as map learning and cued path recall regarding a navigated real-life labyrinth. Steele et al. attempt to explain this discrepancy by advancing the theory that the performance of autistic people on spatial memory tasks degrades faster in the face of increasing task difficulty, when compared with normally developed individuals. These results suggest that working memory is related with an individual's ability to solve problems, and that autism is a hindrance in this area.
People with ASD appear to have a "local bias" for visual information processing, that is, a preference for processing local features (details, parts) rather than global features (the whole). One explanation for this local bias is that people with autism do not have the normal global precedence when looking at objects and scenes. Alternatively, autism could bring about limitations in the complexity of information that can be manipulated in short-term visual memory during graphic planning.
The difficulties that individuals with ASD often have in regards to facial recognition has prompted further questions. Some research has shown that the fusiform gyrus in ASD individuals acts differently from in non-ASD individuals which may explain the aforementioned troubles regarding facial recognition.
Research by Baltruschat et al. has shown that improvement in spatial working memory for autistic individuals may be possible. Adapting a behaviorist approach by using positive reinforcement could increase WM efficiency in young children with ASD.
Auditory and phonological memory.
The research on phonological working memory in autism is extensive and at times conflicting. Some research has found that, in comparison with spatial memory, verbal memory and inner speech use remain relatively spared, while other studies have found limitations on the use of inner speech by autistic people. Others have found a benefit to phonological processing in autism when compared with semantic processing, and attribute the results to a similar developmental abnormality to that in savant syndrome.
In particular, Whitehouse et al. have found that autistic children, when compared with typically developing (TD) children of a similar mean verbal age and reading ability, performed better when asked to recall a set of pictures presented to them, but not as well when asked to recall a set of printed words presented interspersed with the pictures; a competing verbal task given to both sets of participants also worsened performance on control children more than it did on autistic children. They also reported that word length effects were greater for the control group. These results are contested by Williams, Happé, and Jarrold, who contend that it may be verbal IQ, rather than verbal ability, that is at issue, and Whitehouse et al.'s subjects were not matched on chronological age. Williams, Happé, and Jarrold themselves found no difference between autistic children and controls on a serial recall task where phonological similarity effects, rather than word length effects, were used as an alternate measure of inner speech use.
Joseph et al. found that a self-ordered pointing task in autistic children involving stimuli that could be remembered as words (e.g. shovel, cat) was impaired relative to comparison children, but the same task with abstract stimuli was not impaired in autistic children. In contrast, Williams et al. found that autistic children scored significantly lower than TD children on spatial memory tests. Williams et al. not only experimented with spatial memory tasks, but verbal memory as well. They discovered that in an experimental group and a control group of TD individuals, that while differences were found in spatial memory ability, no significant difference was seen between the groups regarding verbal memory. Interestingly, they ran their experiments with both children and adult participants. Autism is a developmental disorder, so it is possible that life experiences could alter the memory performance in adults who had grown up with autism. Williams et al. experimented with children separately to see if they had different results from their adult counterparts. They used a WRAML (Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning) test, a test specifically designed to test memory in children. Test results were similar across all age groups, that significant differences between TD and autistic participants are found only in spatial memory, not verbal working memory.
Gabig et al. discovered that children with autism, regarding verbal working memory and story retelling, performed worse than a control group of TD children. In three separate tasks designed to test verbal working memory, the autistic children scored well below the expected levels for their age. While results do show lower scores for autistic children, there was also information that suggested lack of vocabulary contributed to the lower scores, rather than working memory itself .
There is some evidence from an fMRI study that autistic individuals are more likely to use visual cues rather than verbal cues on some working memory tasks, based on the differentially high activation of right parietal regions over left parietal regions in an N-back working memory task with letters.
Opposing results.
Some data has shown that individuals with ASD may not have WM impairments and that this supposed impairment observed is a result of testing. Nakahachi et al. argue that the vagueness of many tests measuring WM levels in people with ASD. They found that people with ASD only performed worse on WM tests if the test itself could have interfered with the completion of the test. These findings show that the type of test and the way it is presented given to individuals with ASD can have a strong impact on the results, therefore much caution should be taken in choosing the design of a study focusing on WM in people with ASD.
Ozonoff et al. have found similar results in their studies on working memory in individuals with ASD. Their research showed no significant difference between individuals with ASD and those without ASD in tests designed to measure various aspects of working memory. This supports the notion that Autism does not inhibit WM. Results from experiments that have shown lower WM facilities in ASD individuals may be due to the human interaction nature of these experiments as individuals with ASD exhibit low social functioning skills. Experiments utilizing computer rather than human interaction remove this problem and may head more accurate findings.
Further research by Griffith et al. also indicates that WM may not be impaired in those with Autism. There may be some executive function impairments in these individuals, but not in working memory and rather in social and language skills. Other research conducted by Griffith et al. on young Autistic individuals did not measure verbal working abilities, but nonetheless found no significant difference between the executive functions in Autistic and non-Autistic individuals. Though there has been much research that alludes to low WM abilities in those with Autism, these recent data weaken the argument that Autistic individuals have little WM facilities.

Angry Birds

Angry Birds is a video game franchise created by Finnish computer game developer Rovio Entertainment. Inspired primarily by a sketch of stylized wingless birds, the first game was first released for Apple's iOS in December 2009. As of October 2010, 12 million copies of the game were purchased from Apple's App Store, and then the company started to design versions for other touchscreen-based smartphones, including the Android, Symbian and Windows Phone operating systems. It has since expanded to video game consoles and PCs.
"Angry Birds" has been praised for its successful combination of addictive gameplay, comical style, and low price. Its popularity led to versions of "Angry Birds" being created for personal computers and gaming consoles, a market for merchandise featuring its characters, spin-offs and television series based on the franchise, and even long-term plans for a feature film. With 2 billion downloads across all platforms and including both regular and special editions, the franchise has become the highest downloaded freemium game of all time. It has also been called "one of the most mainstream games out right now", "one of the great runaway hits of 2010", and "the largest mobile app success the world has seen so far".

Media.
Rovio is investigating ways to expand the "Angry Birds" brand, including merchandise, television shows and movies. Mikael Hed, CEO of Rovio Mobile, has envisioned a feature film in the stop-motion animation style of Aardman Animation. To that end, Rovio has purchased a Helsinki-based animation studio to prepare "Angry Birds" short cartoons on the Nicktoons station's Nickelodeon Extra, the first of which was a Christmas special named "Wreck the Halls" that debuted in December 2011. Hed acknowledges that such a film would be years away, and that Rovio must keep the characters relevant until then, by producing sequels or new ports of the original game.
Television.
"Angry Birds Toons", a TV series based on the game made its debut on March 16, 2013. "Toons" is released through third-party video distribution platforms, including Comcast’s Xfinity On-Demand in the US, Samsung Smart TVs, and Roku set-top boxes. It is also available in a number of countries on traditional television broadcasts. "Angry Birds Toons" is available on mobile devices by an additional "Toons" channel on all of the "Angry Birds" apps homescreens.
In April 11, 2014, Rovio released "Piggy Tales", a stop motion animated series. It tells the stories of the Minion Pigs' life.

Rovio also hired David Maisel, former executive producer of Marvel Studios films such as "Iron Man" and "Thor", to head up production of feature-length films.
Merchandise.
Toys.
The most notable toys are the Telepods, created by Hasbro. These figures are created for "Angry Birds Star Wars II", "Angry Birds Go!", and Angry Birds "Stella". These are figures used to "teleport" a character of the corresponding figure into the game by scanning it, via the device's camera. Telepods figures are not only for this use, but can also be used with the toy set that comes with the toy, like other Angry Birds board games.
One of the 2012 New Models for Hot Wheels cars from Mattel is based on the Red Bird from "Angry Birds". The package card bears both the Hot Wheels and Angry Birds logo.
Print publications.
On 2011, Rovio published a cookbook titled "Bad Piggies: Egg Recipes", along with doodle books based on some characters of the game. After a few weeks of the release of Angry Birds Space, they also released Angry Birds Space books about numbers, alphabets, and stickers.
On March 20, 2012, "National Geographic" published a paperback book titled "Angry Birds Space: A Furious Flight Into The Final Frontier" shortly before the release of "Angry Birds Space" which became available on March 22, 2012.
In the same year, Rovio created a contest with the prize "Angry Birds: Hatching a Universe", a book about the franchise and all the characters.
As of March 10, 2014, IDW Publishing announced that they will be publishing Angry Birds Comics starting in June 2014, with Paul Tobin being the writer.
Beverages.
At Spring 2012, Olvi started to manufacture Angry Birds softdrinks, when Olvi made a deal with Rovio for making them. At first, there came two different tastes: "Tropic" (tropical fruits). and "Paradise" (pineapple-mandarin). At September 2012 Olvi released two new tastes to the softdrink collection: "Lagoon" (pear-apple) and "Space Comet" (orange-cola).
Parks and Attractions.
Angry Birds Land.
The game's characters have been used, officially or otherwise, in amusement park attractions. In September 2011, the Window of the World theme park in Changsha, China opened an unlicensed "Angry Birds" attraction. Visitors to the park uses a large slingshot to launch stuffed versions of the bird characters at green balloons that represent the pigs. Upon learning of the attraction, Rovio Entertainment reported to be considering working with the theme park to officially license it. In March 2012, Rovio announced plans for an official "Angry Birds" Land, that opened in April 28, 2012, at the Särkänniemi adventure park in Finland. Angry Birds Land is expected to open by May 2014 at Johor Baharu City Centre in Malaysia.
Most recently it was announced that UK theme park Thorpe Park will open their own Angry Birds Land themed area within the park in May 2014. The new area will consist of the reinstatement of the 4D Cinema with a 10 minute long Angry Birds film with 4D effects, a new addition of themed Angry Birds Dodgems and a slight re-theme of existing drop tower ride Detonator.
Angry Birds Activity Park.
Rovio also opened "Activity Parks" of the game. The first one was opened in Lightwater Valley that features dancefloors, and playgrounds that includes slides, and massive touchscreen devices for visitors to play Angry Birds. They also have Angry Birds Space attractions as part of the activity park, with a mini movie theater. They also include shops for Angry Birds merchandise and Birthday party rooms. The attraction also opened in Vuokkati and holiday clubs. Vuokkati features obstacle courses and races, and a separate "Angry Birds Town" with cars for kids to ride.
Angry Birds Space Encounter.
On June 2013, Rovio and NASA opened an Angry Birds Space-themed park at the Kennedy Space Center titled "Angry Birds Space Encounter". It features various experiences to the Angry Birds Space video game, such as creating characters and shooting birds at pigs. The attraction was also opened in the Space Center Houston.
Influence.
Television.
The "Angry Birds" characters have been referenced in television programs throughout the world. The Israeli comedy show "Eretz Nehederet" (in English: "a Wonderful Country"), one of the nation's most popular TV programs, satirized recent failed Israeli-Palestinian peace attempts by featuring the Angry Birds in peace negotiations with the pigs. Clips of the segment went viral, getting viewers from all around the world. The sketch received favorable coverage from a variety of independent blogs such as digitaltrends.com, hotair.com and intomobile.com, as well as from online news media agencies such as "Haaretz", "The Christian Science Monitor", "The Guardian", and MSNBC. American television hosts Conan O'Brien, Jon Stewart and Daniel Tosh have referenced the game in comedy sketches on their respective series, "Conan", "The Daily Show", and "Tosh.0". In the "30 Rock" episode "Plan B", guest star Aaron Sorkin laments to Liz Lemon, "Our craft is dying while people are playing "Angry Birds" and poking each other on Facebook". He then provides a tip for Liz to improve her score in the game. In February 2011, American journalist Jake Tapper mockingly introduced U.S. Senator Chris Coons as the "Angry Birds champion of the Senate" during the National Press Club's annual dinner. Some of the game's more notable fans include Prime Minister David Cameron of the United Kingdom, who plays the iPad version of the game, and author Salman Rushdie, who claims he is "something of a master at "Angry Birds"". Basketball star Kevin Durant is an avid fan of "Angry Birds", and regularly plays other NBA stars in matches, although he is weary of cheating. In August 2011, the Milwaukee Brewers played the "Angry Birds" theme song during the pre-game introductions of the arch-rival St. Louis Cardinals players, in reference to former Cardinals' manager Tony LaRussa's propensity to bean opposing players. "Angry Birds" also appears briefly, for comic relief, during a scene in the 2013 film "", in which Zartan plays the game while waiting for the world leaders' response to his threats of annihilation. Angry Birds were featured in the 2013 Helsinki episode of Veep. Angry Birds was referenced in the film "The Starving Games", a parody of "The Hunger Games".

Advertisements.
"Angry Birds" and it's characters have been featured in advertisements for other products. In March 2011, the characters began appearing in a series of advertisements for Microsoft's Bing search engine. At the 2011 South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, Nokia used scrims on a downtown building to project an advertisement for its new N8 handset that included the game's characters. A June 2011 T-Mobile advertisement filmed in Barcelona, Spain included a real-life mock-up of the game in a city plaza, while Nokia used the game in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to promote an attempt to set a world record for the largest number of people playing a single mobile game. Finnair has also used Angry Birds in their advertising, including taping an Airbus A340 airliner with the Angry Birds figures and holding an Angry Birds tournament on board a flight to Singapore. Rovio has also prepared a number of web-based promotional variants of "Angry Birds" themed around creations of other companies, such as Finnish snack company Fazer, Spanish pizza delivery chain Telepizza, and Japanese television network Fuji TV, as well as promotions of American brands including Cheetos, Wonderful Pistachios and Coca-Cola.
Sports.
Also in March 2012, Formula 1 driver Heikki Kovalainen unveiled an "Angry Birds" crash helmet that he will use in the 2012 season, following sponsorship from Rovio. Kimi Räikkönen has also a "Angry Birds Space" logo on his cap. "Angry Birds" has teamed up with the Lotus F1 Team for the upcoming 2012 Monaco Grand Prix, with its logo on the top of each Lotus Renault F1 car's nosecone, as well as a promotional web-based version of "Angry Birds" in honor of Kovalainen.
HockeyBird, an angry hockey playing bird, was the official mascot of the 2012 IIHF Ice Hockey World Championships. It was designed by Toni Kysenius and Rovio Entertainment.
Video games.
The game's popularity has spawned knock-off and parody games that utilize the same basic mechanics as "Angry Birds". For example, "Angry Turds" features monkeys hurling feces and other objects at hunters who have stolen their babies. Another game, entitled "Chicks'n'Vixens" and released in beta form on Windows Phone devices, replaces the birds and pigs with chickens and foxes, respectively. The developer of "Chicks'n'Vixens" intended the game as a challenge to Rovio Mobile, which stated at the time that a Windows Phone port of "Angry Birds" would not be ready until later in 2011.
Religion.
"Angry Birds" has inspired works of religious analogy. A five-part essay entitled "Angry Birds™ Yoga – How to Eliminate the Green Pigs in Your Life" was written by Giridhari Dasa of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (i.e. Hare Krishna) of Brazil, utilizing the characters and gameplay mechanics to explain various concepts of yoga in Gaudiya Vaishnavism as understood and interpreted by the Hare Krishna. The piece attracted much media attention, in Brazil and abroad, for its unique method of philosophico-religious presentation. The piece was also recognized and appreciated by Rovio Mobile's Peter Vesterbacka, who was prompted to comment on Twitter, "Very cool! I can see Angry Birds Yoga becoming a worldwide craze;-)".
Controversy.
In January 2014, it was revealed that "Angry Birds" was considered a "leaky app" and was used to collect data about its users including their sexual orientation and location by the NSA and GCHQ. In retaliation, anti-NSA hackers defaced Rovio's website. Claims were made by Edward Snowden that the app was "leaky" and that they were capable of siphoning off data.
According to "The Register", the information was leaked through the in-game advertisement code like that embedded by Millennial Media: “Millennial's tracking software generates a personal record for each user that can store information from their political affiliation and sexual orientation to whether their marital state was single, married, divorced, engaged or "swinger." This information is used to target in-app ads more effectively, and can be collected by UK and US intelligence agencies for analysis”. In a statement to the press, Rovio denied that they were themselves providing any information to the intelligence agencies, but did not exclude the possibility that their advertisers might do so.
Following this revelation, on January 29, the Angry Birds site was defaced by hackers who replaced it with "Spying Birds" via a DNS hijacking attack. According to Rovio, "The defacement was caught in minutes and corrected immediately". The Syrian Electronic Army tweeted after the incident that the attack had been carried out by "a friend" of theirs.

Catholic prayers

The Catholic Church many prayers which are used prayed individually or in group liturgies. In some cases, these prayers are shared in common numerous groups of Christians—as is the case with the "Our Father" or "The Lord's Prayer." 
However, some prayers exclusively characterize Catholic worship. The most notable are:
The Hail Mary.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the Fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
The Sign of the Cross.
In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. 
This prayer is traditionally accompanied by a gesture. The right hand is touched to the forehead upon saying the word "Father," to the chest when saying "Son," to the left shoulder when saying "Holy," and to the right shoulder when saying "Spirit." Thus, the shape of a cross is traced upon the front of the body as the prayer is recited. This easily recognizable gesture is typically taken to characterize Catholics. It is said before every pray.

Joseph Estephan

Joseph VI Estephan (1729–1793) (or Yusuf Istifan, "Stephan", ) was the Maronite Patriarch of Antioch from 1766 until his death in 1793.
Life.
Joseph Estephan was born in the village of Ghosta, in the Keserwan District, Lebanon in 1729. He studied in Rome in the College of the Propaganda where he remained from 1739 to 1751. Returning to Lebanon on May 21, 1752 he was ordained as a priest by his uncle, bishop John Estephan, and in August 1754 he was consecrated bishop of Beirut by Patriarch Simon Awad.
His uncle, John Estephan, participated in the 1736 Council of Mount-Lebanon and in 1742 became bishop of Beirut. In 1754 John Estephan retired in order to let his nephew, Joseph, be appointed bishop of the same town. Joseph Estephan remained bishop of Beirut till 1762, when he quarreled with Patriarch Tobias El Khazen, because he refused to support the uncanonical arrangement of dioceses decided by Tobias, and also because he was accused of being ordained bishop at 23 years, not 25 years as Joseph Estephan always claimed.
After Tobias' death, Joseph Estephan was elected patriarch on June 9, 1766, and confirmed by Pope Clement XIII on April 6, 1767. He summoned a synod in Ghosta in 1768 concerning the distribution of tithes, an issue on which he collided with many bishops who complained against Propaganda Fide. The main complaints against him were caused by his strong support of the visionary nun Hindiyya al-'Ujaimi. The Jesuits, as well as some Maronites, became more and more mistrustful of her doctrine and personal cult, and finally obtained from Rome an inspection carried out in 1775 by Pietro Craveri of Moretta (1726–1801). Following the advice of Moretta, on July 17, 1779 Pope Pius VI issued a decree stating that Hindiyya was deluded and her revelations and doctrines false. Moreover, the Pope suspended Joseph Estephan from all functions (apart from episcopal appointments and consecrations) and nominated Michael El Khazen as Vicar.
Joseph Estephan, hearing the news, tried to travel to Rome, but his health forced him to stop at Mount Carmel. In the meantime Michel Khazen summoned a synod, on July 21, 1780 in which he did not even invite Estephan. This situation lasted till the young secretary of Pietro Craveri of Moretta, Joseph Tyan, took it upon himself to travel to Rome, against the will of Craveri, to plead Estephan's case. On September 28, 1784 Propaganda Fide restored Joseph Estephan in all his functions.
Restored as Patriarch, Joseph Estephan summoned other two synods, the first on September 6–11, 1786 at 'Ain-Caqiq, which was not approved by Rome, and the second, approved, at Berke from December 3–18, 1790 under the presidency of Germanos Adam. On January 14, 1789 Joseph Estephan converted the convent of 'Ain-Warqa into a seminary. He died on April 22, 1793.

Unni starts taking bribes on his father's behalf and eventually culminates in stealing money from his own house. In the process, he alienates his father and gets thrown out of home. He finds accommodation with his collegemates at the "house of sin". Later he finds it difficult to stay there as his friends began avoiding him when he was not able to pay them his part of the house-rent. Meanwhile, he is frequently visited by Parvathi, his cousin and lover. Parvathi was able to make him realise his faults but even she is not able to unite him with his father.

Arthur Marshall (American football)

Arthur James Marshall Jr. (born April 29, 1969) is a former American football wide receiver in the National Football League. He was signed by the Denver Broncos as an undrafted free agent in 1992. He played college football at Georgia.
Marshall also played for the New York Giants.
Early life.
Marshall played high school football for Hephzibah High which is located in Hephzibah, Georgia. He was born in Fort Gordon, Georgia.
Collegiate career.
Marshall was a stretch-the-field type of wide receiver for head coach Ray Goff and the University of Georgia from 1988–91. The 5-11, 175-pound speedster hauled in 39 receptions for 524 yards during his senior season in 1991 as the Bulldogs completed a 9-3 season ranked No. 19 by the AP College Football Poll.
Additionally, Marshall returned kickoffs for Georgia as he had totalled 15 such returns for 347 yards averaging 23.1 per return during 1991.
Professional career.
Marshall was picked up by the Denver Broncos after going undrafted in the 1992 NFL Draft.

Gender in youth sports

Gender in youth sports refers to the role and influence that both young male and females have in sports. The participation of youth in sports is a matter that is always trying to be improved and appeal to all genders. There are organizations across the world that are trying to improve the disparity of participation rates between boys and girls.
Participation rates in youth sports by gender.
In the United States, 8 million 3rd–12th grade girls and 12 million boys play sports Women's Sports Foundation (2011): ERIC. Web. 26 Oct. 2013. There are more boys participating in sports than girls in urban and suburban areas. Studies on third to fifth grade children found that in urban areas 59% of girls participated in sport compared to the 80% of boys who participated. In suburban areas, 81% of girls compared to 89% of boys involved in youth sports, while in rural areas 73% of girls participated compared to 69% of boys (Sabo, 2008). Gender equality for younger children was better in rural and suburban areas than in urban areas. Young urban girls, especially, have a narrower window of opportunity for becoming involved with sports than their male counterparts and girls from suburban and rural communities. 1 in 4 ninth-to 12th-grade urban girls have never participated in organized or team sports, compared to about 1 in 6 urban boys (Sabo and Veliz, 2008).
Age and social class contribute to differences in gender participation. Half of low-income parents agreed that their schools and communities were not meeting the needs of girls as much as those of boys (Hessel, 2000). More African-American and Hispanic parents feel schools and communities are failing their daughters. Boys in immigrant families are more likely to play sports than girls are. Nearly a quarter (23%) of children have at least one parent born outside the United States. Compared to boys, girls in immigrant families report lower rates of athletic participation. Many immigrant parents also hold more traditional attitudes toward girls’ and boys’ interest in sports (Sabo and Veliz, 2008). However, girls are exploring a wider array of sports and exercise activities than boys do, including traditional, recreational and newly emerging sports such as cheerleading, dance, double dutch and volleyball. Boys focus more on traditional sports and exercise activities, which, most often, take the form of organized school and community sports (Sabo and Veliz, 2008). In short, progress on the gender front in U.S. sports has been made, but it remains uneven, and it is often poor and urban girls who are being left behind.
Girls of color are doubly impacted by both gender and race discrimination in sport (Sabo and Veliz, 2008). Fifteen percent of all girls and 16% of all boys who participate in sports are African-American. 17% of female athletes and 15% of male athletes are Hispanic, while Asian girls and boys comprise 8% and 12%, respectively, of children who play sports. And yet, proportionally fewer girls of color are involved with sports than white girls. Girls of color are also much more likely than their male counterparts to be non-athletes. The same discrepancies across racial and ethnic groups do not exist among boys.
Although a gender gap in youth sports historically exists, female participation in organized youth sports has steadily increased. Sports like soccer, baseball, and basketball are shared by both girls and boys. However, there are still sports still considered "boy sports", such as football and wrestling. More females are involved in sports that were once considered male only sports due to the fact that youth sports organizations such as the National Alliance for Youth Sports have added more mixed gendered opportunities for children over the years (Stiebling 1999). Sport is seen as a status enhancer in school that has led to a difference in participation levels based on factors such as gender, ethnicity, and grade level (Shakib, 2011)
Gender and sports opportunities.
The rise of organized sports opportunities for girls has increased dramatically since the passage of Title IX in 1972. During the 1972–73 season, the AIAW offered its first seven national championships which included badminton, basketball, golf, gymnastics, swimming & diving, track & field, and volleyball. By the 1980–81 season, the AIAW national program had grown to 39 championships in 17 different sports with 6,000 women's teams and 960 member institutions (Everhart and Pemberton, 2001). The number of female participants continues to rise as variables such as opportunity for involvement, valuing of sports as part of total development and overall fitness for girls and women has increased. Among the many forms of sexism in sports, perhaps the most pervasive and devastating is the lack of equal opportunities for girls to compete in programs similar to those offered for boys (Seefeldt, V., Ewing, M. E, 1995).
Despite the tremendous gains in sports participation made by girls and women during the last 30 years, there is still a persistent gap in the enrollment figures between males and females. The participation of girls is currently only 39% of the total participation in interscholastic athletics. There has been a slow but steady climb toward equity in the percent of female participants, from 32% of the males’ participation in 1973–74 to 63% in 1994–95 (Hessel, 2000). Generally more boys attend PE classes than girls, especially in urban and rural schools. (Sabo and Veliz, 2008) Urban girls are left out when it comes to physical education (PE) in the United States, with 84% report having no PE classes at all in the 11th and 12th grades. Rural girls in the same grades are not far behind with 68% reporting no PE classes. Across the country, young low-income children both girls and boys are undeserved with regard to school-based physical education.
Girl's sports have been defined and shaped by "men's values, men's understanding of the world, and men's experiences-all of which suppress the development and expression of female values" (Blinde, 1989). The history and evolution of gendered sports substantiates this statement and provides evidence of gender bias in sports as well as sport culture created and sustained to maintain that bias. Girls have had to adapt within the established male model. Boys continue to receive the bulk of sport participation opportunities, scholarships, and access to better coaching (Everhart and Pemberton, 2001). These gains for boys has resulted in the loss of women's sport culture, therefore merging female sports model into the existing male sport model. The ability for girls to play has lead to the reduction of female sport administrative leadership and female coaches.
Adult gender in youth sports.
Statistics.
The gendered participation in youth sports is seen not only by the separating of boys and girls, but also in the roles of the adults who are contributing to the teams as volunteers. Messner and Bozada-Deas studied yearbooks from a group of 538 youth baseball and softball teams and 1,490 from the American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO) in 1999 to 2007. Only 13.4% of the teams had women coaches on the soccer team and only 5.9% of the team’s management in baseball and softball were women. There are slots reserved just for team parents, whose sole duty is to take care of snacks, make phone calls to organize team events, hold fundraising, and providing support for the team players, majority women. Men holding the title of team parent is non-existent.
Responsibility.
Men prefer not to volunteer for team parent positions due to the responsibilities placed on them compared to those of the coach. Women's roles in sports are to hold the position of team parent, while men are usually head coach or assistant coach. Team parents are often labeled “team mom”, making this position more likely for female parents than male parents. The gendered assumption of team parent being called “team mom” and the idea of having a “team dad” is ridiculous and often laughed at. Lench (2009) points out how men do not apply for team parent positions because it is seen as feminine, making it undesirable and saves them from embarrassment or ridicule. Therefore when given the opportunity to volunteer, more women choose to be team parents, while men will most likely choose to be assistant coaches. For men, coaching involves more masculine tasks, involving leadership over the entire team, setting up games, practices, and trained athletes. According to the website Responsible Sports, a responsible coach is NOT: soft, a source of empty unearned praise, or satisfied with everyone just having fun. Coaching needs masculine qualities and feminine qualities are not suitable for a coach. In addition, women are often stereotyped of being more compassionate with the team, while men are more strict and tough. This leads to the general understanding that men are to be coaches and women are to be team parents so parents can apply themselves accordingly.
Parents' involvement in youth sports.
For girl athletes, the mentors they mentioned in exercise and sports were their coaches and physical education teachers. For boys, dads and coaches topped the list of main mentors. 46% of boys and 28% of girls credit their father for teaching them “the most” about sports and exercise. While mothers and fathers provide similar levels of encouragement and support for both their daughters and sons, many girls may be shortchanged by dads who channel more energy into mentoring their sons than their daughters (Sabo and Veliz 2008).
Gender gap in physical education.
The gender gap in physical education: Urban girls are the have-nots of physical education (PE) in the United States, with 84% report having no PE classes at all in the 11th and 12th grades. Rural girls in the same grades are not far behind with 68% reporting no PE classes. Across the country, young low-income children both girls and boys are underserved with regard to school-based physical education. Generally more boys attend PE classes than girls, especially in urban and rural schools. (Sabo and Veliz 2008)
Adult gender mentoring in youth sports.
Professional coaching.
In 1972, more than 90% of women's programs were administered and directed by women. By 1994, less than 21% of those same programs were administered/directed by a female, and by 1999 the percent of female head athletic administrators had dropped to 17.8% (Everhart and Pemberton, 2001). Men began applying for, and getting, women's coaching positions. In 1972, over 90% of the coaches who coached women's sports were female. By 1999, 45.6% of women's sports coaches were female. Coaching opportunities for men in women's sports were increasing significantly. Conversely, the number of female coaches in men's sports has not seen the same growth. About 2% of NCAA men's programs have a female coach at the helm (Everhart and Pemberton, 2001).
Volunteer Coaching.
Messner and Bozada-Deas studied yearbooks from a group of 538 youth baseball and softball teams and 1,490 from the American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO) in 1999 to 2007. Only 13.4% of the teams had women coaches on the soccer team and only 5.9% of the team’s management in baseball and softball were women. Team parents, whose sole duty is to take care of snacks, make phone calls to organize team events, hold fundraising, and providing support for the team players are predominantly filled by women. 
Men prefer not to volunteer for team parent positions due to the responsibilities placed on them compared to those of the coach. Women's roles in sports are to hold the position of team parent, while men are usually head coach or assistant coach. Team parents are often labeled “team mom”, making this position more likely for female parents than male parents. The gendered assumption of team parent being called “team mom” and the idea of having a “team dad” is ridiculous and often laughed at. points out how men do not apply for team parent positions because it is seen as feminine, making it undesirable and saves them from embarrassment or ridicule.
Parental gender bias in sports.
For girl athletes, the mentors they mentioned in exercise and sports were their coaches and physical education teachers. For boys, dads and coaches topped the list of main mentors. 46% of boys and 28% of girls credit their father for teaching them “the most” about sports and exercise. While mothers and fathers provide similar levels of encouragement and support for both their daughters and sons, many girls may be shortchanged by dads who channel more energy into mentoring their sons than their daughters (Sabo and Veliz, 2008).
Youth sports in urban communities.
More parents in lower-income families indicated that girls were not getting similar support and resources in athletics as boys. Young urban girls, especially, have a narrower window of opportunity for becoming involved with sports than their male counterparts and girls from suburban and rural communities. 1 in 4 ninth-to 12th-grade girls have never participated in organized or team sports in urban schools, compared to about 1 in 6 urban boys (Sabo and Veliz 2008). Half of low-income parents agreed that their schools and communities were not meeting the needs of girls as much as those of boys compared with about 1/3 of middle-and upper-income parents (Hessel 2000). While a majority of parents say they want similar levels of athletic opportunity for their daughters and sons, many believe that their schools and communities are failing to deliver the goods. Youth sports are racially and ethnically diverse. 15% of all girls and 16% of all boys who participate in sports are African-American. 17% of female athletes and 15% of male athletes are Hispanic, while Asian girls and boys comprise 8% and 12%, respectively, of children who play sports. And yet, proportionally fewer girls of color are involved with sports than white girls. Girls of color are also much more likely than their male counterparts to be non-athletes. The same discrepancies across racial and ethnic groups do not exist among boys. Girls of color are doubly hit by both gender and race discrimination in sport (Sabo and Veliz 2008). Many parents are aware that girls are getting fewer opportunities in sports and physical activity than boys are. More African-American and Hispanic parents feel schools and communities are failing their daughters. Also boys in immigrant families are more than likely to play sports than girls to play sports. Nearly a quarter (23%) of children have at least one parent born outside the United States. Compared to boys, girls in immigrant families report lower rates of athletic participation. Many immigrant parents also hold more traditional attitudes toward girls’ and boys’ interest in sports (Sabo and Veliz 2008).

Survivor Greece 1

Survivor 1, was the first edition of the Greek version of the popular reality show Survivor and it aired from September 2003 to December 2003. This season being the inaugural season of Survivor in Greece did not involve many twists, however there were a few notable twists that did occur. The first of these twists occurred in the second episode cycle in which North team member Elias Valasis and South team member Nikos Lamprinakis swapped tribes. In this same episode cycle, Eugenia Katsarou entered the game and joined the South team following their win at the second reward challenge. All three of the contestants previously mentioned had immunity at their tribes first tribal council after the second immunity challenge. When the merge came, the two teams initially stuck with their former tribe members and voted against their former opponents, however as time went on alliances were made within teams. The most powerful of these alliances was that of the trio Evagelina Dermetzoglou, Nikos Lamprinakis, and Orthoula Papdaki, who controlled the later stages of the game and ultimately made up the final three. When it came time for the final three they competed in two challenges in order to decide who would be in the final two. Eventually, it was Evagelina Dermetzoglou who won the season over Nikos Lamprinakis with a jury vote of 8-0.

Mammalian promoter database

MPromDb (Mammalian Promoter Database) is a curated database of gene promoters identified from ChIP-seq The proximal promoter region (upstream of the core-promoter region) contains the cis-regulatory elements of most of the transcription factors (TFs). Recently a better approach to annotate active promoters has been demonstrated with a combination of ChIP-seq and computational technique. This technique has been used to find the target genes of TFs in mammalian systems. The MPromDb is based on this technology. Curated promoter sequences for eukaryotic organisms are provided by EPD database, however, promoter activity information at tissue/ cell centric level is not offered. The MPromDb data base added active RNAP-II promoters identified after analyzing ten different mouse cell/tissue ChIP-seq experiments performed with RNAP-II antibody and six different human cell types. The datas were got by a series of computational methods followed by manual correct to ensure its high level quality. In the newest version of MPromDb, about 507 million uniquely aligned RNA Pol-II ChIP-seq reads have already been analyzed from 26 different databases, including six human cell-types and 10 distinct mouse cell/tissues.

Percival Frost

Percival Frost (1817–1898), was an English mathematician.
Life.
Frost was born at Kingston upon Hull on 1 September 1817, the second son of Charles Frost. He was educated at Beverley and Oakham, and entered St. John's College, Cambridge, in October 1835, graduating B.A. as second wrangler in 1839 and M.A. in 1842. He was chosen first Smith prizeman in 1839, beating the senior wrangler, Benjamin Morgan Cowie, his fellow-collegian, and he was elected to a fellowship at St. John's College on 19 March. In 1841 he was ordained deacon, and in the same year vacated his fellowship by marriage. He held a mathematical lectureship in Jesus College from 1847 to 1859, and in King's College from 1859 to 1889; but his chief work consisted in the tuition of private pupils, among whom were Lord Justice Rigby, William Kingdon Clifford, and Joseph Wolstenholme.
He was a man of wide interests and varied attainments, an accomplished pianoforte player, and a successful painter in water-colours. On 2 June 1841 he was married at Finchley to Jennett Louisa, daughter of Richard Dixon of Oak Lodge, Finchley.
In 1854 Frost edited the first three sections of Isaac Newton's ‘Principia’ (Cambridge, 8vo). New editions were published in 1863, 1878, and 1883. In 1863 he prepared, in conjunction with Joseph Wolstenholme, ‘A Treatise on Solid Geometry,’ of which second and third editions, by Frost alone, appeared in 1875 and 1886. ‘Hints for the Solution of Problems in the Third Edition of “Solid Geometry”’ was published in 1887. In 1872 appeared his third work, ‘An Elementary Treatise on Curve Tracing.’ On 7 June 1883 Frost was admitted a fellow of the Royal Society, and in the same year he was elected by King's College, Cambridge, to a fellowship, which he retained until his death. In 1883 Frost proceeded to the recently established degree of D.Sc.
Frost died at Cambridge on 5 June 1898, at his house in Fitzwilliam Street, and was buried on 10 June in the Mill Road cemetery, Cambridge. 
Besides the works already mentioned, Frost was the author of numerous papers in the "Cambridge Mathematical Journal", the "Oxford and Cambridge Journal of Mathematics", and the "Quarterly Journal of Mathematics".

RegulonDB

RegulonDB is a database of the regulatory network of Escherichia coli K-12.
A Database is a model of a piece of the world. In this sense, RegulonDB is a model of the complex regulation of transcription initiation or regulatory network of the cell. On the other hand, it is also a model of the organization of the genes in transcription units, operons and simple and complex regulons. In this regard, RegulonDB is a computational model of mechanisms of transcriptional regulation.
Introduction.
Most of the times, regulatory elements occur upstream of operons. However, there is a good number of regulatory elements (promoter and binding sites) located inside a promoter, defining a different transcription unit.
An important aspect to keep in mind in order to avoid misunderstandings in the content of a database, is the fact that our current understanding and characterization of different genes, operons and regulatory mechanisms, is quite variable. For some genes, their mechanisms are very well described, whereas in other cases there is no regulation defined for a given promoter, or a promoter has been characterized upstream of a poorly characterized operon or transcription unit. Our definitions and conventions affect not only the way well-characterized systems are described, but also the way the lack of information is taken into consideration.
Definitions.
Check the glossary for all definitions.
Operon.
An operon is the set of one or several genes and their associated regulatory elements, which are transcribed as a single unit. The classical definition is that of a group of two or more genes transcribed as a polycistronic unit. For database purposes, we extend the definition to include the possibility of operons with only one gene. An operon is, therefore, a group of one or more contiguous genes transcribed in the same direction. Please note that given this definition, an operon must contain a promoter upstream of all genes and a terminator downstream. It is also relatively common to find operons with several promoters, some of them internally located, thus transcribing a partial group of genes. In all cases so far, one gene belongs to only one operon.
The graphic display of an operon contains all the genes of its different transcription units, as well as all the regulatory elements involved in the transcription and regulation of those TUs. The genome browser shows genes and operons, accepting also monocistronic operons.
Transcription unit (TU).
A Transcription unit is a set of one or more genes transcribed from a single promoter. A TU may also include regulatory protein binding sites affecting this promoter and a terminator. Note: A complex operon with several promoters contains, therefore, several transcription units. Given the definition of an operon , at least one transcription unit must include all the genes in the operon.
Promoter.
A promoter is the DNA sequence where RNA polymerase binds and initiates transcription. Notes: Promoter sequences are specific to the different sigma factors associated to the RNA polymerase core. A promoter is represented as a stretch of upper-case nucleotide sequence, 60 bases upstream and 20 downstream from the precise initiation of transcription or +1. More recently, it has been identified that there are RNAP binding sites which do not initiate transcription. Following the definition, these are not promoters, since they are not functional.
Binding site.
The TFs binding sites are physical DNA sites recognized by transcription factors within a genome. Note: Historically, binding sites for transcriptional regulators were defined as operator sites. There are several meanings of an operator site. In their wider meaning, operator sites are sites for repressors or activators. Later on, the term "activator sites" was opposed to "operator sites", where operator sites were limited to sites for the binding of repressor regulators. In bacteria, specifically for Sigma 54 promoters, the term "UAS" for upstream activator sites is also used to refer to activator site that functions remotely. A related term is that of enhancers. An enhancer has been initially defined as an activator sites, tht functions from far upstream, and which functions in either orientations in relation to the promoter.
Terminators.
The region where transcription ends, and RNAP unbinds from DNA.
On the graphic display of the different objects in RegulonDB.
The graphic display of an operon contains all the genes of its different transcription units, as well as all the regulatory elements involved in the transcription and regulation of those TUs. An operon is here conceived as a structural unit encompassing all genes and regulatory elements. An operon with several promoters located near each other may also have dual binding sites, indicating that such a site can activate one particular promoter, but repress a second one.
In the same page, the collection of the different TUs is displayed below the operon. The graphic display of an operon contains all the genes of its different transcription units, as well as all the regulatory elements involved in the transcription and regulation of those TUs.
The graphic display of a TU will always contain only one promoter -when known- with the binding sites that regulate its activity, followed by the transcribed genes. Note that dual sites are frequently displayed at a TU as repressors or activators. This is because the site will have a particular effect on the promoter of that TU.

Wonderful Life (Cliff Richard album)

Wonderful Life is a soundtrack album by Cliff Richard with The Shadows to the 1964 film "Wonderful Life". The album was very successful reaching #2 in the UK Albums Chart as well as #5 in the Australian Album Chart. Released in the US with title "Swingers Paradise" it was not so successful.
Curiously, some of the recordings on the album are not those used on the actual film soundtrack, including the title song. The vocal takes are different and in some cases the orchestrations are also altered slightly. The recordings on the album are generally more polished than the soundtrack ones
The vinyl LP released on the Columbia label in the UK featured an inner sleeve with a storyline outlining the plot and the position of each of the musical numbers, illustrated with stills from the film.

System of a Down Reunion Tour

The Reunion Tour is a concert tour by Armenian American rock band System of a Down, celebrating the band's reunion, after going on hiatus in 2006.
Background.
Following several weeks of internet rumors, the reunion of the band was officially announced on November 29, 2010, when several European festival dates in June 2011 were announced. Later, the band confirmed a Russian show, in Moscow, on June 21, 2011. More European dates were later announced, with several North American headlining dates for May 2011 being announced on March 1, 2011. On March 21, 2011, the band announced a concert in Irvine, California, on May 25, 2011.
On February 9, 2011, Shavo Odadjian posted on his Twitter profile: "Just finished up our first rehearsal in 5 years. Amazing! !! I love my band."
On April 7, 2011, SOAD commented on Official website: "We want to know which songs you most want to hear on the road this summer. As a reward for telling us your top 6 setlist requests, one winner from each tour city will win a pair of tickets to his/her local show. They will also win a setlist from the show they attended, signed by all of us." On April 19, 2011, posted this: "For each date of the upcoming SOAD North American and EU Headline Tour, we are auctioning a pair of tickets, plus a personal lunch with John Dolmayan. All proceeds will benefit Music For Relief’s Earthquake and Tsunami Relief efforts in Japan. Click HERE to bid now. In addition, John will be auctioning off his personal drum kit at the end of the tour. The kit will be autographed by John and a collection of other noted drummers... More details coming soon."
On May 6, 2011, the band confirmed a show in Brazil, Rock in Rio Festival, on October 2, 2011, and in July, the band announced four headline shows in Latin America, with one more show in Brazil, and one in Mexico, Argentina and Chile.
On May 14, 2011, The Pulse of Radio, made an interview with the band's drummer John Dolmayan. He was said about the band's five-year hiatus, "I personally don't like breaks - I like to continue playing. But it was nice to go off and be John Dolmayan, as opposed to John from System, for a while. I think everybody had similar feelings."
Asked in October 2011 whether System of a Down will record a new album, drummer John Dolmayan replied, "We're gonna take it day by day. We still have a few more shows to do in South America — we're playing in Buenos Aires and we're playing Santiago, so we're looking forward to that. And then we're gonna go home. We don't generally work during Christmas and New Year's — that's a time for our family and stuff — so we'll be home for the next three or four months. And then Serj takes off and goes to New Zealand for a couple of months — he lives part time in New Zealand. And then I think he's got another solo album coming out next summer. So you might see System touring next summer, you might not. But for the people who are waiting for an album — I know there's a lot of people waiting for an album; I'm waiting for an album just like they are. It's gonna happen when it's right and when we can make something that tops what we've done in the past. Because we don't really wanna rest on our laurels — where what you've done in the past is what you depend on. Well, I don't wanna do that, and I know the rest of the guys don't wanna do that. Instead of resting on our laurels, we wanna throw them away and create something new and specific for this generation that they can say that's their System of a Down."
