Williams v. Lee

Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S. 217 (1959), was a landmark case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the state of Arizona does not have jurisdiction to try a civil case between a non-Indian doing business on a reservation with tribal members who reside on the reservation, the proper forum for such a case is the tribal court.
The Navajo tribe has lived in the southwestern United States and first came into contact with the United States government in 1846, signing a treaty with the government in 1849. In the early 1860s, the government removed the tribe from their traditional area to eastern New Mexico at the Bosque Redondo. In 1868, the United States and the tribe signed a new treaty that put them back on a reservation in their traditional lands, where the tribe focused on raising sheep and goats.
Background.
History of the tribe.
The Navajo tribe came into contact with the United States in 1846 after General Stephen W. Kearney marched to Santa Fe during the Mexican-American War. The tribe signed its first treaty with the United States in 1849, and signed another treaty in 1868. The 1849 treaty was immediately suspect among tribal members due to the actions of Colonel John Macrae Washington that resulted in the death of Navajo leader Narbona. With relations strained, in 1862 the United States began a military campaign under Kit Carson to remove the tribe from the mountains of Arizona to the Bosque Redondo on the Pecos River near present day Fort Sumner, New Mexico. This resulted in the Long Walk of the Navajo, removing the tribe from their home and relocating them to eastern New Mexico. The 1868 treaty was signed at Fort Sumner and provided for the tribe's return to the current reservation and traditional homeland, but also for 15,000 head of sheep and goats and 500 cattle to be provided to the tribe by the U.S. government. Unlike many U.S. - Indian treaties, this treaty was celebrated by the Navajo as preserving the majority of their land for the tribe.
Reservation.
The Navajo reservation was originally established in eastern Arizona / western New Mexico. Although the tribe was promised , the tribe actually received . Unlike most reservations, the Navajo reservation actually expanded over the following years. Presidential executive orders added significant land to the reservation beginning in 1878 and running through 1901. By 1934 and the last Congressional adjustment, the reservation contained . At the same time the tribe was increasing its land, it was increasing the amount of livestock, particularly sheep. In the 1930s, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) estimated that the reservation supported 575,000 sheep and 186,000 goats. The livestock was overgrazing the land and the experts estimated that the land could only support half the number that was being grazed. The BIA then began an aggressive stock reduction program that reminded many Navajo of the imprisonment at the Bosque Redondo and was opposed by the tribe.
At the same time, the Navajo began to develop a more detailed system of self-government, including a court system. In 1949, Congress passed the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation bill with a proviso known as the Fernandez amendment which would have granted the states jurisdiction over tribal lands. President Harry S. Truman vetoed the bill and requested that Congress send it back to him without the Fernandez amendment, which it did the following year.
Indian traders.
The first licensed trading with the Navajo began in 1849, and Auguste Lacome was the first trader recorded. After the return from the Bosque Redondo, Army sutlers at the military posts such as Fort Defiance, Arizona began to trade extra rations for Navajo wool. By 1883, traders were buying 1.3 million pounds of wool in addition to other products raised or produced by the tribe The traders, who were largely Mormon, often pushed for maximum immediate production rather than a long-term sustainable yield. About 1885, the traders began to transform from a barter economy to a credit system. The traders had a monopoly, and created a virtual system of debt bondage by being the only ones to offer credit for goods needed by tribal members. However, after 1890 the U.S. government prohibited traders collecting for old debts and require that they use cash instead of trader script or "tin" money.
Part of this was due to the nature of the trading system, where the trader could not own their own store or land, which must be leased from the Navajo. In addition to the restriction on land, the trader had to post a $10,000 bond with the BIA. Long-term traders, such as John Lorenzo Hubbell or William Keams, established relationships with tribal members to foster long-term repeat business. These traders began to market Navajo blankets for use in mining camps and as area rugs in the eastern United States. By 1943 there were over 140 trading posts on the reservation.
Credit dispute.
Hugh Lee was an Indian trader who operated a trading post on the reservation. Lee was licensed by the BIA to operate the trading post and he sold goods on credit to members of the tribe. Paul Williams and his wife Lorena were enrolled tribal members of the Navajo tribe, and resided on the Navajo reservation. Williams bought goods on credit and did not make payment. In 1952, Lee filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of Apache County, Arizona and obtained a writ of attachment for sheep belonging to Williams.
State court.
Williams moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the state court did not have jurisdiction on the reservation. In the meantime, Lee was granted an order authorizing the Apache County Sheriff to sell at auction the sheep belonging to Williams. In 1954 the trial court finally issued a ruling denying the motion to dismiss and in 1955, found for Lee. Williams appealed to the Arizona Supreme Court.
Arizona Supreme Court.
At the Arizona Supreme Court, Williams argued that the proper jurisdiction was the Navajo tribal court and that a state officer did not have the authority to sell the sheep. The Arizona Supreme Court held that the state did have jurisdiction to hear civil cases involving Indians and non-Indians, since there was no Congressional prohibition against it. The court did rule, however, that federal regulations prohibited the sale of Indian livestock without the approval of BIA. Williams then appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case and issued a writ of "certiorari".
Supreme Court.
Arguments.
Norman M. Littell argued the case for Williams. Littell argued that Congress had plenary power to end tribal immunity but had not done so, and that other federal laws preempted state jurisdiction. William W. Stevenson argued the case for Lee. He argued that the Navajo tribe was a creation of the federal government, and not a long-standing tribe like the Cherokee. His position was that there was no tribal sovereignty. Solicitor General J. Lee Rankin filed an "amicus curae" brief at the request of the court, urging reversal. While Rankin supported reversal, he did so on narrow grounds, based on federal regulations of Indian traders.
Opinion of the court.
Justice Hugo Black delivered the opinion of a unanimous court. Black noted that in 1830, the state of Georgia had tried to extend its laws to the Cherokee reservation and that "Worcester v. Georgia" clearly established that state law and jurisprudence did not reach into the confines of a reservation. He then stated that the question was whether, absent Congressional authorization, a state infringed on the right of the tribe to govern itself. The Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act was designed by Congress to strengthen the tribal government and tribal courts. Black observed that "Significantly, when Congress has wished the States to exercise this power it has expressly granted them the jurisdiction which "Worcester v. Georgia" had denied." Finally, he noted that the Navajo tribal court has jurisdiction to hear civil cases brought by non-Indians against tribal members and that no federal statute has given Arizona jurisdiction to hear such cases.
Black stated that allowing the exercise of state jurisdiction would undermine tribal sovereignty and that only Congress had the authority to do so. The case was reversed.
Subsequent developments.
"Williams" has been cited as the initial case in the modern era of federal Indian law. It is widely cited in cases dealing with tribal sovereignty and state infringement on tribal rights. Some claim that "Williams" formed the basis for the Indian self-determination era and for the Indian Self-Determination Act. The case was also the first of a series of cases that limited Arizona's authority within the Navajo reservation. The case is considered a landmark case involving tribal sovereignty.

HMS Kingfisher (1770)

HMS "Kingfisher (also spelled King's Fisher or Kingsfisher") was the second ship in the 14-gun "Swan" class of ship sloops, to which design 25 vessels were built in the 1760s and 1770s. She was launched on 13 July 1770 at Chatham Dockyard, and completed there on 21 November 1770. She took part in the American Revolutionary War, enforcing the blockade of the Delaware Bay, and served in the Battle of Turtle Gut Inlet, near Cape May, New Jersey. While under the temporary command of Lieutenant Hugh Christian, she was burnt by her own crew to avoid capture on 7 August 1778 in Narragansett Bay during the Battle of Rhode Island.
Service history.
"Kingfisher" was commissioned in September 1770 under Commander Thomas Jordan, and sailed for North America on 1 August 1771. In September 1772 command passed to Commander Jacob Lobb, then on 9 April 1773 Commander George Montagu, and in November 1775 under Commander Alexander Graeme. 
Norfolk.
"Kingfisher" under Commander Montagu arrived at Norfolk, Virginia on 8 September 1775, along with under Commander Graeme and under Commander Matthew Squire. On 30 September 1775, the mayor and council of Norfolk wrote to Lord Dunmore about the "illegal and riotous" behaviour of the crews of "Kingfisher" and "Otter". 
On 1 January 1776, she began a heavy bombardment of Norfolk along with "Liverpool" and "Otter", setting the town on fire.
Delaware Bay.

Early on the morning of 29 June 1776, "Kingfisher" and "Orpheus" resumed chase.
"Nancy", to evade capture of her supplies of gunpowder and arms, ran aground at Turtle Gut Inlet. She was assisted by the American ships "Lexington", "Reprisal", and . 
In the ensuing battle, "Nancy" was set on fire and exploded, killing the master's mate and six men on longboats from "Kingfisher". Also during 1776, "Orpheus" and "Kingfisher" captured the "Adrian", which was sailing from Philadelphia to France with a cargo of tobacco, flour, bread and staves.
Narragansett Bay.
On 27 August 1777, "Kingfisher" under Commander Graeme engaged the newly built 14-gun "Oliver Cromwell" under Captain Samuel Chace, Jr., ran her ashore, and burnt her. During the fight, the brigantine escaped.
On 7 February 1778, "Kingfisher" under Lieutenant Christian was stationed in the Sakonnet Passage to Narragansett Bay. On 30 May, Christian led the boats of the squadron, which were carrying a detachment of troops, in an attack on the saw mills on a creek near Taunton River. The attack was successful.
When French Admiral d'Estaing's squadron arrived in Narragansett Bay on 29 July 1778, she was burnt to prevent the French from capturing her.

Cantabroraphidia

Cantabroraphidia is an extinct genus of snakefly in the family Mesoraphidiidae. The genus is solely known from fossil amber found in Cantabria, northern Spain, dating to the Albian age of the Early Cretaceous Period. Currently the genus comprises a single species Cantabroraphidia marcanoi.
History and classification.
"Cantabroraphidia marcanoi" is known only from one fossil, the holotype, specimen number ES-07-6, which is housed in the Museo Geominero in Madrid, Spain. The specimen is composed of an almost entirely complete adult insect of unidentified sex. Preserved in a transparent mass of amber, the specimen is fixed in association with a large amount of plant debris and one adult dipteran. Despite the amount of debris obscuring portions of the individual, enough details are present and visible to show the specimen was not from a previously described genus. The fossil was recovered from outcrops of the Las Peñosas Formation in the Cave of El Soplao near Rábago, part of the Cantabria autonomous community in Northern Spain. "Cantabroraphidia" was first studied by group of paleoentomologists lead by Ricardo Pérez-de la Fuente of the University of Barcelona and including Enrique Peñalver, Xavier Delclòs, and André Nel. Their 2010 type description of the new genus and species was published in the French journal "Annales de la Société Entomologique de France". The genus name "Cantabroraphidia" was coined by the researchers as a combination of the snakefly genus "Raphidia" and "Cantabria" which is in reference the Cantabria autonomous community where the outcrops that produced the fossil are located. The specific epithet "marcanoi" is from in honor of Francisco Javier López Marcano as recognition for his efforts to have the El Soplao ambers studied. "Cantabroraphidia marcanoi" is one of six described snakefly species found in the Albian deposits of Cantabria, and was the first Raphidiopteran to be described from El Soplao.
Description.
The lone specimen of "Cantabroraphidia marcanoi" is a nearly complete adult. The hyaline forewings are partially preserved and display brown vein structuring that hosts strong setae. While partial, the forewings are complete enough to show the full length to be and a maximum of in width. The elongated pterostigma is faintly infumate, long and lacks crossveins except for the basal crossvein that closes the cell. Excluding the prothorax most of the thorax and all of the abdomen were crushed prior to entombment in the liquid sap. As such very little can be determined about these areas of the insect. Overall the thorax and abdomen appear to be of similar length as the prothorax and head. One of the few identifiable characteristics on the top of the prothorax is a small line of spines along the front edge.

The name "Römergrund" is derived from the dialect word "ram" or "rom" (plural "rämme" or "römmer") 'raven' or 'carrion crow', thus meaning 'place with ravens or crows'. The Slovene writer Evgen Lah (1858–1930) speculated in 1893 that the German name "Römergrund" was related to Standard German "Römer-" ('Roman') in an essay defending the antiquity of the history of Carniola. Correspondingly, an early attempt to Slovenize the name "Römergrund" was "Rimski svet" (literally, 'Roman place, Roman area'). The modern Slovene name "Rimsko" (literally, 'Roman') is a similar mistranslation, and it has been characterized as a "senseless coinage for Römergrund, which has no connection at all with the Romans."
History.
Rimsko was a village inhabited by Gottschee Germans. Several prehistoric tumuli are located in a nearby woods along the road. Before the Second World War it had nine houses. In May 1942 the settlement was burned by Italian troops and it was not rebuilt after the war. In the 1960s a hunting lodge was built in the area.

Girolamo Sartorio

Girolamo Sartonio, also known as Hieronimo Sartorio and Geronimo Sartorio (died April 1707 in Venice), was an innovative Italian architect and engineer who worked mainly the German cities of Hanover, Hamburg, Leipzig and Erfurt. His neoclassical designs were based on Palladian architecture. He was a noted expert in the installation of stage equipment and theatrical machinery and also worked as a builder or consulting architect on the construction of various opera houses, such as the Oper am Gänsemarkt in Hamburg. He is also credited with the beginnings of opera in Leipzig and the construction of the opera house in Prague.
Family.
Born in Venice, Girolamo was the brother of Venetian composers Antonio Sartorio (1630–1680) and Gasparo Sartorio (1625–1680). In 1673 he married Emerantia Gertrud von Wintheim, the daughter of Erich von Wintheim, in Hanover and he became a citizen of the principality in 1674.
Life and work.
Between 1667 and 1685 Sartorio was the Building Administrator in the service of John Frederick, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and then Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg in Hanover. During his time he led significant construction projects that beautified the city, including the expansion of the Herrenhausen Gardens and Leineschloss Palace, where he installed a theater and worked on external decorations, the Kapuzinerflügel wing and the court chapel. He also designed the bridge from the Leineschloss across the Leine River and the Neustädter Kirche, built 1667 to 1670 as an early aisleless church. He presented a model for the Parnaßbrunnen fountain on the Neustädter Markt in 1671. During his time in Hanover he wrote a report for the construction of a library in Wolfenbüttel, on a request of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, then a librarian there.
Sartorio was then called to design the first public opera house in Germany and first opera house in Hamburg, the Oper am Gänsemarkt, and construct the stage. It opened in 1678. In 1692/93 he was in Leipzig, where he established the first opera theatre of the city on the Brühl, opened in 1693.

Dipterocarpus intricatus

Dipterocarpus intricatus (Khmer: "tra:ch, tra:ch sa, tra:ch snaèng, tra:ch sra:", Thai: "yang-krat") is a species of tree in the family Dipterocarpaceae found in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. The tree, itself deciduous, is found in dense deciduous forests and clear forests. It is often met in pure stands in deciduous, periodically flooded lowland forests, but can also be found in dense forest at up to 1300m altitude. In Thailand it sometimes occurs growing gregariously with "D. obtusifolious", "D. tuberculatus", "Shorea robusta" and "S. siamensis", sometimes in pure stands forming the climatic dry deciduous dipterocarp forest. This forest type covered a large area of eastern, north-eastern and northern Thailand, from peneplain at 150-300m elevations to slope and ridges up to 1300m above sea level. It does also occur in Lowland dipterocarp forest (0-350m) in Thailand. In Vietnam, it is described as common in dry forests. The tree prefers poor, sandy and lateritic soils derived from granitic and sandstone formations. Seedlings develop hardy rootstock and thick rough bark on the stout stem, affording fire-protection in the ground-fire prone early hot dry season. Coppicing occurs freely up to a moderate size. In Thailand leaves are shed from November, defoliation is complete by February, with leaf starting at this time, or sometimes a little before. Flowering occurs from February to April, fruiting from April to May, though in certain areas or some years with a late rainy season these periods start up to 3 months earlier. The species grows from 15 to 30m tall.
The fruit has 2 prominent, elongated, netted wings, 6–8 cm long x 1.5–2 cm wide, on top of an ovoid or ellipsoid fruit-body, 1.5–2 cm long x 1-1.5 cm wide, with undulate ribs, 2-3mm wide.
In Cambodia the resin is mainly used in torch-preparation, while the red-brown wood is "appreciated" for cart and house construction. Sold as "fancy wings" in the potpourri trade
The genus "Nanophyes" is associated with seed predation of "D. intricatus".

Maurice Southgate

Maurice Southgate (20 June 1913—17 March 1990) was a British RAF officer who served in the Special Operations Executive (SOE) during World War II. Under the codename "Hector", he organised the STATIONER circuit operating across the Limousin region from 1942 to 1944. He was captured by the Gestapo near Montluçon in 1944 and deported to Buchenwald concentration camp where he remained until its liberation by American forces in 1945.
Biography.
Little is known of Maurice Southgate's early life, but it is understood he was educated in Paris, attending a technical college, which later allowed him to start his own upholstery business.
With the coming of World War II, Southgate was part of the British Expeditionary Force, and in June 1940 was evacuated from Saint-Nazaire on the , which was later sunk by German aircraft. Fortunately, Southgate was able to swim away, being picked up by another vessel which later docked in Falmouth, Cornwall. In England he was posted by the RAF to the Air Ministry, where notably, he became reacquainted with his childhood friend Pearl Witherington. In May 1942 his name was passed through to SOE's French Section, where he was accepted for training in July. His superiors were impressed with his serious and thorough approach, resulting in him being readied for the job of organiser for the newly established STATIONER circuit. In January 1943, after parachuting near Clermont-Ferrand with his wireless operator Jacqueline Nearne, Southgate began establishing communication networks around Vierzon, Châteauroux and Limoges, and also in the far south-west, around Tarbes.
Towards the end of the summer STATIONER began to attack railway targets, power stations and aircraft works, in the hope that more adventurous sabotage was possible. In September a courier, Pearl Witherington, arrived to assist, and a month later Southgate was flown back to London to report on his progress.
Returning to France, just before D-Day to help with the incoming Allied invasion, Southgate landed near Toulouse in January 1944. Burdened with a considerable workload, including the command of 2,500 men, on 1 May 1944, a weary Southgate was caught by a Gestapo trap in Montlucon, where he missed the secret signal. After interrogation, Southgate was deported to Germany, to the Buchenwald concentration camp, where 16 of his compatriots were hanged. He escaped this fate through feigning illness and was admitted to the camp hospital. Southgate spent several more weeks being genuinely ill. After which he was moved to work in the tailor's shop, where he kept a low profile and remained until American forces liberated Buchenwald on 11 April 1945.
Extracts from Southgate's wartime diary have been published online.

Bodhgaya inscription of Mahanaman

The Bodh Gayā inscription of Mahānāman is an epigraphic record documenting the construction of a temple by the Sri Lankan monk Mahānāman at Bodh Gaya in the late sixth century.
Location.
Bodh Gayā is located south of Patna in Bihar, India. The shrine built by Mahānāman stood to the north of the Mahabodhi temple. The inscription, recovered by Alexander Cunningham in the course of his excavations, is reported to be in the Indian Museum; the inked impression used by Fleet is in the collection of the British Museum.
Publication.
The Bodh Gaya inscription was published by John Faithfull Fleet in 1888. It has subsequently drawn the attention of a number of scholars. Sylvain Lévi reinterpreted the inscription in 1929 in a study that showed the author of the text was familiar with Vasubandhu and the "Abhidharmakoṣa". In a complex analysis, Senarath Paranavitana attempted to link the Mahānaman of the inscription with Mahānāman, author of the Mahavamsa, but this interpretation has been rejected by Oskar von Hinüber.
Description and Contents.
The inscription records the building of a temple by a monk named Mahānāman. It is dated year 267, in the month of caitra on the 8th day of the śudi fortnight. This date is generally accepted as belonging to the Gupta era and thus refers to 586-87 CE.
Text.
The purport of the inscription is given in lines 9-11.
9-11) laṅkādvīpaprasūtaḥ ... san mahānāmanāmā tenoccair bbodhimaṇḍe śaśikaradhavalaḥ sarvvato maṇḍapena kāntaḥ prāsāda eṣa smarabalajayinaḥ kārito lokaśāstuḥ
Translation.
The purport of the inscription can be translated as follows:
This beautiful mansion of the Teacher of mankind, dazzling white as the rays of the moon ... has been caused to be made by him ... whose excellent name was Mahānāman, born in the island of Laṅkā.

The Spoilers (Beach novel)

The Spoilers (1906) is a novel by Rex Beach based in Alaksa that was one of the best selling novels of 1906. 
The book was quickly adapted into a play, and was later adapted to film five times, in 1914, 1923, 1930, 1942, and 1955. The novel is based on a true story of corrupt government officials, such as Alexander McKenzie, seizing gold mines from prospectors, which Beach witnessed while he was prospecting in Nome, Alaska during the Nome Gold Rush.
Plot.
Young fearless prospector Roy Glenister and his older partner, Dextry are headed back to Nome on the first ship of the season, eager to return to protect their gold claim called the "Midas", which promises to yield them great wealth. On the trip, they defend a young woman who boards the ship from her pursuers—and who is also intent on reaching Nome as soon as possible. Glenister immediately begins to fall for the young beauty, who turns out to be Helen Chester, niece of Judge Arthur Chester, recently appointed as the first federal judge for the Alaska Territory—the "law" is coming to the wild northern frontier. Except it turns out the law is crooked. The Judge and the federal marshall are really under the thumb of strongman politician Alexander McNamara. After reaching Nome, McNamara succeeds in being appointed receiver of all the most lucrative mining claims in the region, based on fraudulent disputes over the validity of the miners' claims. Glenister, Dextry, and a number of naive Swedes are dispossessed of their lands. The miners hire lawyers to fight on the legal side, and also form a vigilante group to fight the "law". McNamara rules ruthlessly, running the mines himself. Glenister sinks into despair, believing that Helen is in on the conspiracy against the miners, and almost loses his stake in the Midas in a night of reckless gambling. He is only saved from that fate by Cherry Malotte, whose unrequited love for Glenister has brought her to Nome. Helen slowly learns about the scheme being perpetrated by McNamara, her uncle, and others, while her affections are torn between Glenister and McNamara.

<doc id="36656081" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36656081" title="Son of Boss">
Son of Boss

Son of BOSS is a type of tax shelter used in the United States, one that was designed and promoted by tax advisors in the 1990s to reduce federal income tax obligations on capital gains from the sale of a business or other appreciated asset. Its informal name comes from ("Bond and Option Sales Strategy"), an earlier tax shelter that Son of BOSS resembles.
Details.
The term was coined by U.S. Treasury officials to describe a variety of tax shelters that sought to wipe out taxes on capital gains from the sale of a business or other appreciated asset; for example, by artificially inflating the basis of a partnership by contributing an asset paired with a contingent liability. The partnership contribution rules at the time ignored the contingent liability that effectively offset the asset. The result was an inflated basis that allowed the taxpayer to claim a loss from the partnership's subsequent unwinding. The shelters involved creating paper losses to offset real gains. All resembled an earlier shelter marketed as "BOSS," short for "Bond and Option Sales Strategy." Beginning in the late 1990s, advisers at some accounting and law firms marketed the Son of BOSS transaction in various forms. It is likely several thousand taxpayers used the shelter before 2000 when the Treasury and the Congress began taking steps to block its tax benefits.
The Son of BOSS schemes involved 1,800 people and cost the government $6 billion in lost revenue, according to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimates. Of the $6 billion, the government has recovered more than half. The IRS started cracking down in 2000. By 2005, 1,165 people had settled Son of BOSS cases with the IRS. The complex structures used in the schemes were difficult, however, for the IRS to unravel. Reuters News Service reported that the IRS was losing some court challenges to its crackdown.
Significant rulings.
In 2000, the Internal Revenue Service issued IRS Notice 2000-44, asserting that Son-of-BOSS transactions were invalid.
The Son of BOSS scheme has been ruled to be invalid for Federal tax purposes. For background, see generally [c American Boat Company LLC v. United States'; and Klamath Strategic Investment Fund v. United States.
In IR-2005-83, Aug. 29, 2005, the IRS reported that in the largest criminal tax case ever filed, KPMG admitted that it engaged in a fraud that generated at least $11 billion in phony tax losses which, according to court papers, cost the United States at least $2.5 billion in evaded taxes. In addition to KPMG’s former deputy chairman, the individuals indicted include two former heads of KPMG’s tax practice and a former tax partner in the New York, New York office of a prominent national law firm.
The only Son of BOSS case which has been decided by the U.S. Supreme Court is United States v. Home Concrete & Supply, LLC', which was decided in 2012. This case concerned primarily whether the statute of limitations was properly applied, and not the validity of scheme itself.
Home Concrete & Supply was a limited liability company formed in 1999 to facilitate a Son of BOSS scheme for two North Carolina businessmen, Robert Pierce and Stephen Chandler, who owned a small oil-and-coal company. The two filed their 1999 tax returns in 2000. They were audited by the Internal Revenue Service in 2006, and were billed that year for unpaid taxes totaling $6 million. The Home Concrete partners sued, arguing the IRS violated a three-year statute of limitations on its power to claim unpaid taxes. The IRS replied it was within its power to bill taxpayers up to six years back when more than 25 percent of a taxpayer's gross income was involved.
The Home Concrete partners lost in District Court but won in February 2011 on appeal. The IRS appealed and the Supreme Court in November decided to take up the case. On April 25, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Home Concrete & Supply, stating that the six-year statute of limitations did not apply when a taxpayer understated his income by overstating his basis.
In the interim, the law firm that helped the Home Concrete partners set up their Son of BOSS transactions, Jenkens & Gilchrist, closed. Two of its partners were found guilty of tax evasion.
IRS collections.
According to the IRS, the IRS collected more than $3.7 billion from taxpayers in 2005 who voluntarily participated in a parallel civil global settlement initiative related to Son of BOSS. The BLIPS and SOS shelters are part of the Son of BOSS family of tax shelters.
2012 Presidential campaign.
In a campaign advertisement released on August 9, 2012, incumbent President Barack Obama made specific reference to his GOP opponent Mitt Romney and Romney's presumed involvement in a Son of BOSS tax avoidance as a Marriott International board member.

Nodosariacea

Nodosariacea is one of two superfamilies making up the foraminiferal order Lagenida. The other being the Robuloidacea. Of these two Nodosariacea is the more advanced, as well as being the younger. 
Nodosariacea are characterized by planispirally coiled, uncoiled, or straight chambers, or which are coiled about a longitudinal axis. Test (or shell) walls are of finely perforate, radial laminated calcite. Apertures are peripheral or terminal, variable in form. Septa, dividing the chambers, are monolamellar, composed of a single layer, while the outer walls may be polylamellar, composed of multiple layers built up with the addition of new chambers. 
Loeblich and Tappan, 1964, in the "Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology" included the Nodosariacea in the Rotaliina, with a range extending from the Permian to Recent, and divided it into three families, the Notodariidae, Polymorphinidae, and Glandulinidae. 
More recently Loeblich and Tappan in 1988 removed Nodosariacea from Rotaliina and combinded it with the newly established Robuloidacea to form the order Lagenina. The number of families was also increased within Nodosariacea to six with the addition of the Lagenidae, Ellipsolagenidae, and Vaginulinidae.

Sustainability Accounting Standards Board

The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) is a US non-profit organization incorporated in 2011 to develop and disseminate sustainability accounting standards. While the FASB has for the past forty years developed the accounting principles currently used in financial reporting in the United States, other social and environmental measures are now understood to be of relevance. The SASB aims to integrate its standards into the Form 10-K which must be filed by public companies with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; in this sense it differs from initiatives such as the GRI, by working within the current system of financial regulation. The general principle is, in Peter Drucker's phrase, "what gets measured gets managed".
Industry specific.
The SASB aims to meet the need for industry-specific reporting standards, to ease comparison and benchmarking. In order to do so, a Sustainable Industry Classification System covering ten sectors and 80+ industries has been devised. From Q4 2012, industry-specific working groups are to convene to pursue the goal of completing the standards within two and a half years. Key performance indicators will then be updated annually. There is recognition that establishing what is material in information that is fundamentally non-financial is complex.
Financing.
During development SASB is to be funded by grants and donations, with the aim to be self-financing thereafter through intellectual property licensing, education and training. Backers include Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Rockefeller Foundation.

Baiyankamys

Classification.
Hinton described " Baiyankamys" as similar in appearance to the species "Hydromys habbema" but differed due to its unreduced pinnae and its lower teeth. It was described as having three lower molars on both sides of the lower jaw, whereas other genera of amphibious murines in New Guinea have only two.
In 1968 Mahoney discovered that the specimen of "B. shawmayeri" was a composite resulting from an incorrectly associated mandible
of the species "Rattus niobe" and the skull of a small water rat. When the correct mandible was found in the BMNH collections Mahoney proposed that, based on their similarity "B. shawmayeri" should be classified as a synonym of "H. habbema". However, Musser and Carleton (1993, 2005) and Flannery (1995) later proposed that the species Hinton described should be classified as "Hydromys shawmayeri", closely related but distinct from "H. habbema", based on the fact that they are easily distinguished by external and cranial traits.
In 2005 Helgen proposed that generic name of "Baiyankamys" be used for "shawmayeri" and "habbema", removing them both from the "Hydromys" genus. This was due to morphological differences in phallic anatomy, and many external and craniodental traits.
Appearance.
"Baiyankamys" is distinguished by soft, dense, frosted grey upperparts; a tail that is longer than its head-body length; a long, narrow Snout, and extremely narrow incisors.
Habitat.
"Baiyankamys habbema" is found in a small region of the upper montane forests of the Snow Mountains of western New Guinea, between 2800 and 3600 m. "Baiyankamys shawmayeri" is found in lower to upper montane forests between 1500 and 2600 m in eastern and central highlands regions of Papua New Guinea.

Kaukab Noorani Okarvi

Kaukab Noorani Okarvi (Born 17 August 1957) is an Islamic scholar, researcher, orator, writer and cleric of Ahle-Sunnat Wa Jamaa’at Sunni (Barelvi). He is known as Khateeb-e-Millat ("Orator of the Nation") by his followers. He is the son of Khateeb-e-A’zam Muhammad Shafi Okarvi.
Early life and education.
Okarvi was born in Karachi, Pakistan. Before his birth in a family of eleven brothers and sisters, His two eldest brothers had died. He is from a business family of Yemani Shaeikhs which converted to Islam due to Abu Bakr. The members of his family came to India for business and settled there hundreds of years ago. His elders were mostly businessmen by profession but personally they had spiritual temperament in nature.
In his book, "Deoband to Bareilly" he writes, "To tell you the truth, I am a mere seeker of knowledge in the fields of religion, spirituality, and scholastic matters. This little bit recognition of letters and words and the skills of experimenting with them that have come to me, it is mostly because of my environment which was due to my kind parents, paternal grandfather, maternal grandmother, teachers and holy people. These revered and respected personalities have guided my learning at every stage of my life." 
Okarvi’s early childhood was spent in Okara, Pakistan. He received his early religious and worldly education at Jaami’ah Hanafiyah Ashraf-ul-Madaaris in Okara. He memorized the Quran at the age of eleven years, taught by Muhammad Abdul Lateef Amjad Sa’eedi.

In 1962 he became the secretary of Bazm-e-Adab and later became its president. During his school and college days he participated in various debates, Qirat and Na’at competitions and also received prizes for it.
During that period he developed love for poetry and literature. At the age of 13 he established an organization of students and youth called "Bazm-e-Shaaheen Pakistan". Its main purpose was to inculcate religious principles, support poor students, and organize competitions of Qira’at, Na’at and speeches and to celebrate Islamic festivals. He also took leave from the school for one and a half years so he could memorize the Qur'an.
In 1957 and 1971, during the war between Pakistan and India, he collaborated with the National Defence and Boys Scouts.

Okarvi’s teachings are not confined to institutions or classrooms. To students of all ages, 
he lectures in large congregations of thousands of people. He often travels to far off villages and cities, during cold bitter nights and warm summers where people gather to listen to his speeches.
He started writing a newspaper column at the age of eight years. In 1967 his first radio program was broadcast. He received ten rupees for a show and in 1969 he appeared on television, for which he received twenty rupees for a show. To date, three thousands of his shows have been telecasted.

In many foreign countries like the Middle East, Africa, India, U.S.A, U.K and Bangladesh his television shows are telecasted. He is interviewed by many prominent TV personalities on different magazines, newspapers.
Personal life.
When asked why he has no interest in politics, he replied, "I can’t lie, I don’t like hypocrisy and breaking promises. I don’t want to gather bad prayers (du’aa) of the people. There are only two topics of my life: purity and sincerity. Everything which is pure; it is good. People should not sit idle they should work and stay busy. I demand perfection and quality in everything. Whoever’s work it may be it should be good." When asked how he developed his humor he replied, "Gham Sehh kar Hansna Hansaana Aa gaya" ("I learned to laugh and make others laugh after enduring pain").
Library.
He has said: "My first love was with books. At the age of six years I started collecting them. Up till now my personal library has a collection of over 50,000 books." These books are in Arabic, Persian, English and Urdu languages. They are of a wide variety of topics including Islam and all its teachings, Urdu literature, fiction, science, history and general knowledge.
Some of his books are used as reference texts by students and scholars.
Orator of the Nation.
He has been called "Khateeb-e-Millat" (Orator of the Nation) by majority of his admirers and followers. He wanted to become a researcher and a professor but his father wanted him to become a religious and spiritual scholar like him. Therefore, initially part-time and then in 1984, after his father's death, Okarvi started giving formal orations and teaching.
He started the Imaamat and Khitaabat of Jum’ah in the Jaame Masjid Gulzar-e-Habib, Gulistan-e-Okarvi (Soldier Bazaar) Karachi which still continues. Okarvi has been leading the Friday prayers and also explaining in detail the Holy Qur'an. Sometimes it takes him three to four months to conclude a certain topic of Qur'an owing to his widespread research-oriented knowledge. On every holy night, Muharram, Ramadan including Jum’atul Wadaa and Laielatul Qadr his passionate speeches are heard by many believers.
Maulana Okarvi Academy Al-A’lami.

Branches of these organizations are working internationally. Beside this he manages charities (Sadaqaat-e-Jaariyah) and two organizations for the printing of Islamic books: Karmaan Waalaa Publishers and Noorani Kutub Khaanah.
Foreign endeavor’s.
In 1975 he went for the first Umrah and spent a whole month of Ramadan in Medina. In 1976 he performed his first hajj. In 1977 he travelled to India for the first time where he visited many cities, shrines, mosques and gave lectures.

In 1979 he visited Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Turkey, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. In 1980 he visited India, the United Kingdom, the United States, South Africa, the Middle East and Australia. In 1990 he again visited the United Arab Emirates to give lectures. These were also broadcast on the local TV.
In 1990 he visited Mauritius and French Islands La Reunion to give lectures. Here the local radio and television covered his visit. Since then he has often been invited by Muslim groups in different countries to give lectures. It was always his desire to start his journey to any country via Madinah so that he could receive the blessings of Muhammad. Therefore he has visited Madinah more than 50 times.
In South Africa, he revived his father's mission. Between 1987 and 1991, Okarvi was invited to South Africa six times. During this period, he visited Swaziland, Botswana, Bophuthatswana, Mozambique, Mauritius, Re-union, Lesotho and Zimbabwe. He authored eight books, which were also translated to English.
The series of these gatherings spread, the practice of reciting Durood Shareefin masaajid before and after Azaan was revived, the practice of holding Eid-e-Meelaad-un-Nabee in many parts of these countries was inaugurated for the first time. Branches of Maulana Okarvi Academy (Al-A'lami) were established, Madaaris(religious schools) were set up. Thousands of workers were trained to serve the creed of Ahle Sunnat, many people embraced Islam, the holding of ten-day Muharram commemorative meetings came into vogue in Transvaal, South Africa’s province.
In 1996 he established Jamaa’at Ahle Sunnat in America. He established for the first time many religious schools in many countries. In Pakistan as well as abroad he participated in many educational and religious conferences. He has preached in more than fifty-one countries, including Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Re-union, Lesotho, South Africa, Botswana, Swaziland, Mauritius, France, India, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Europe, Australia and U.S.A. He has visited some of these countries several times. So far hundreds of people have embraced Islam through him.
Views about other sects of Islam.
In his book, "From Deoband to Bareilly", he wrote: "Even earlier, I was greatly distressed by this thought but lately it increased even more when I visited the African countries. I witnessed this strange phenomenon among the adherents of Islam living in my own homeland and also far away from the homeland that they are after (each other’s throat) their own collars. Why point accusing fingers at others? Even the so-called wayfarers of the road to Madinah, the preachers are changing the truth and truthfulness, and the standard-bearers of peace and security (self-proclaimed) are with their tongues, pens and deeds, disgracing their own Millat and group, their own Masjid and pulpit."
The book was first published in English by Maulana Okarvi Academy (Al-A'lami) in South Africa and then in Urdu in Pakistan. This book became popular with the public.
Publications and literary works.
His first love and interest was writing literature. He has been a part-time lecturer but his main concentration was mostly towards research, writing and oration and up till now in the country and abroad over 7000 speeches has been given by him. He is also translating the Quran in English. Since 1988, he has written several books in Urdu and English. The topics of his books include:

Typhoon Haikui

Typhoon Haikui (international designation: 1211, JTWC designation: 12W) was the third tropical cyclone in the span of a week to impact Mainland China during late July and early August 2012. The name "Haikui", which replaces Longwang, means "sea anemone" in Chinese.
Meteorological history.
Late on July 31, a tropical disturbance formed within a large monsoon trough. On August 1, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) mentioned the system as a tropical depression southeast of Iwo Jima, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert late on the same day. Late on August 2, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression, before the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it "Haikui" early on the next day. Early on August 4, the JTWC upgraded Haikui to a tropical storm. On August 5, the JMA upgraded Haikui to a severe tropical storm when it was located north-northeast of Kume Island. The JTWC upgraded Haikui to a category 1 typhoon Late on August 6, as it developed an eye. At 12Z on August 7, the JMA upgraded Haikui to a typhoon, but the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm simultaneously. Later, Typhoon Haikui made landfall over Xiangshan County in Zhejiang, China at 19:20 UTC (03:20 CST on August 8). 
Preparations and impact.
Japan.
Slowly moving through the Ryukyu Islands for several days, Haikui brought a prolonged period of heavy rain and high winds to several islands. On Okinawa, sustained winds peaked at and gusts were recorded up to . Rainfall amounted to about , bringing several dams to full or near-full capacity. No reports of major damage were received on Okinawa, though numerous tree limbs were downed across the island. A total of 353 flights to and from Naha International Airport were canceled, affecting more than 70,000 passengers.
China.
On August 7, officials in Shanghai closed all parks, banned outdoor activities, canceled summer classes, and suspended outdoor construction. At least 200,000 in the city alone were evacuated and another 256,000 were relocated in neighboring Zhejiang Province. Port officials also called 30,000 ships back to shore to ride out the storm. Throughout the country, an estimated one million people were evacuated ahead of the storm's arrival. In Anhui Province, officials temporarily closed access to the Huangshan mountain range, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Approximately 19,000 people in the area were also evacuated due to the threat of high winds and heavy rain.
Across Zhejiang Province, Haikui caused widespread and severe damage. According to the local flood and drought relief headquarters, 4,452 homes were destroyed and 184,800 hectares were submerged in flood waters. In Sanmen County, where the storm made landfall, nearly 100 villages lost power. In the province alone, economic losses were estimated in excess of ¥10 billion (US$1.57 billion). Additionally, an estimated 4.03 million people were affected by the storm. In Shanghai, two people were killed and seven others were injured in storm-related accidents. Around 4:00 a.m. local time on the morning of August 10, the Shenjiakeng Reservoir in Zhoushan collapsed, destroying one-third of Zhangtu township and killing at least ten people. Authorities stated that an unknown number of people are missing; however, locals estimated that at least 200 people are unaccounted for. Additionally, residents stated that 30–40 were known dead. Local officials "vowed to make all-out efforts to locate the missing" according to the Xinhua News Agency. Local residents feared the death toll could rise significantly as many people living in the area were undocumented migrant workers from other provinces. There has also been criticism over the effectiveness of the rescue effort, with one resident stating that it took an hour for rescue personnel to arrive in the area after the dam collapsed. Hospitals around the disaster area were reportedly overwhelmed with an influx of casualties stemming from the collapse, though no number was stated. Following the collapse, officials blocked off the area where the dam used to be and denied reporters access to the area.
Heavy rains, in excess of in Anhui Province triggered severe flooding that destroyed 4,473 homes and affected 3 million people. Authorities evacuated approximately 156,000 people in the province. High winds, measured up to on Mount Guangming in the Huangshan mountain range, left 962,000 households without power. At least three people were killed in the province and economic losses amounted to ¥3.28 billion (US$515.69 million). One person was also killed in Jiangsu Province. In Jiangxi Province, heavy rains, measured up to in Jingdezhen, triggered significant floods that affected more than one million people. More than 145,000 people were relocated as homes became submerged in water. Flooding along the Wuhu-Guixi Railway line stranded 12 trains and trapped thousands of people. In one train, more than 1,000 people were trapped for 10 hours as repairs were conducted.
In the wake of widespread flooding brought about by the typhoon, the National Commission for Disaster Reduction and the Ministry of Civil Affairs activated level four emergency plans in Anhui, Jiangxi, Shanghai, and Zhejiang Provinces. Relief teams were dispatched to the four provinces to assist in relief efforts.
Philippines.
Although located hundreds of kilometres away from the Philippines, the southerly flow from Typhoon Haikui enhanced the southwest monsoon across much of Luzon. As a result, widespread heavy rains impacted regions still recovering from deadly floods triggered by Typhoon Saola less than a week earlier. During a 72 hour span from 6–8 August, of rain fell in parts of Metro Manila, leading local media to compare the event to Typhoon Ketsana in 2009, which killed 464 in the city. Some of the most severe flooding took place along the Marikina River, which swelled to near-record levels. During the afternoon of 7 August, the river reached a height of , well beyond the flood level of and about below the record level set during Typhoon Ketsana. About 70 percent of Metro Manila were affected by flooding. Some areas were submerged in up to . Due to the expanding floods, officials in the city evacuated more than 23,000 residents from flood-prone areas and relocated them to shelters set up across the area. According to a reporter from the British Broadcasting Corporation, many residents were reluctant to leave their belongings behind, and some traveled back through flood waters to retrieve their belongings. Officials feared the flooding could worsen as the La Mesa Dam continued to overflow by then. At least nine people were killed and four others were injured in a landslide in Quezon City.
Numerous schools in Metro Manila, Central Luzon, and CALABARZON had suspended classes. As a precautionary measure, officials cut power to some areas of National Capital Region (NCR). At least 250,000 people left their homes as flooding covered more than a third of the city. The head of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) compared the deluge to the Kevin Costner film "Waterworld".
In response to the flooding, the NDRRMC allocated approximately ₱13 million (US$311,000) worth of relief funds and deployed 202 personnel to assist in search and rescue missions. The search and rescue missions were hampered by strong currents in flooded streets. Philippine President Benigno Aquino ordered officials to maximize the effort on rescuing and aiding affected residents.
On 8 August, more than 1 million families were already affected. The NCR and nine nearby provinces were already placed under a state of calamity, with some areas were flooded up to 2 storeys. 90 percent of Metro Manila were already submerged in flooding. Communications were affected badly, though distress calls and SMS from thousands of Metro Manila residents and their worried relatives flooded television and radio stations as most power and water connections were lost. Red warning was already downed to yellow during morning but turned back into red warning during afternoon after another set of continuous heavy rain falls again in Metro Manila until midnight of August 9, 2012. Some schools extended their suspension of classes until Saturday. Airports also had severe flooding, forcing some flights to land at the Clark International Airport in Pampanga and other airports nationwide or altogether rebooking.
Throughout the Philippines, a total of 109 people have been confirmed dead as of August 17th 2012 and 14 people were injured. In terms of damage, a total of 12,962 homes were damaged, of which 3,354 were totally destroyed and 9,608 were partially damaged. Losses throughout the country in agriculture amounted to ₱2,404,483,051.72 while infrastructure damage reached ₱651,362,230.00.

Polish Cultural Institute and Museum (Winona, Minnesota)

The Polish Cultural Institute and Museum is located at 102 Liberty Street in Winona, Minnesota. Known locally as the Polish Museum, it is housed in a lumber yard office built by the Laird-Norton Lumber Company in 1890.
The Polish Cultural Institute.
The Laird-Norton Building was purchased in 1977 by Father Paul Breza, a Winona-born priest of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Winona. It was intended to store historical materials pertaining to Polish immigrants in Winona, but disagreements within Winona's Polish community led to the formation of two separate organizations: the "Polish Heritage Society" and the "Polish Cultural Institute". Under Fr. Breza's leadership, the Polish Cultural Institute was formally incorporated in 1979 to continue renovating the Polish Museum and to otherwise foster an appreciation of Polish contributions to the Winona community. 
In 2010, the Polish Heritage Society inducted Fr. Breza into its Polish Heritage Hall of Fame, formalizing a reconciliation between the two organizations. Plans are underway for the Polish Heritage Society to be merged into the Polish Cultural Institute.
The Polish Museum.
The first floor of the Museum building contains exhibits and other materials relating to Polish immigrant life in Winona and the surrounding areas. A gift shop offers for sale books, clothing, music and other items, many of which are imported from Poland. In recent years, two nearby buildings have been acquired: the Schultz House is being renovated to serve as a heritage house, and the Annex serves as a site for cultural events, such as dances and musical performances. The Annex also features a 165-foot mural illustrating the lives and contributions of Polish immigrant families in Winona.
The Diocesan Collection.
The second floor of the Museum building is devoted to a collection of artifacts recovered from churches in the Diocese of Winona, such as the Basilica of Saint Stanislaus Kostka. While this collection has been acquired and curated by Fr. Breza, the items themselves remain the property of the Diocese. The collection is extremely extensive and includes statuary, sanctuary furniture, vestments, and other semi-forgotten accoutrements of nineteenth-century Polish Catholicism in the United States. Occasionally, items from the collections are lent out to area Catholic churches seeking to enhance the historicity of their worship spaces.
Cultural Activities.
The Polish Cultural Institute has always been active in fostering an understanding of Polish culture, whether the immigrant culture of Winona or that of modern Poland. In recent years, as appreciation of Kashubian-American culture has increased, the Polish Cultural Institute has featured Kaszubian customs (such as the Blessing of Flowers and "Smaczne Jablka" or Apple Fest) and reached out to Kaszubian Poles, especially in the town of Bytow, which is one of Winona's sister cities. One regular activity is the exchange of high school students between Bytow and Winona. Another is musical presentations at the Annex, which range from local polka bands to the performance of recently discovered music written by Polish immigrants.

As part of the celebrations for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the BBC produced the film Bert and Dickie (also called "Going For Gold: The '48 Games"), depicting Dickie Burnell and Bert Bushnell's achievement at the 1948 Games.
Plot.
Thrown together just five weeks before the final of the 1948 London Olympics, Bert Bushnell and Dickie Burnell row together in the double sculls.
Reception.
Paddy Shennan of the Liverpool Echo said Bert and Dickie is "thoroughly absorbing and uplifting" and "a winning drama about a winning team." James Watson of The Telegraph highlighted the performances of Douglas Hodge and Geoffrey Palmer: "Douglas Hodge brilliantly conveyed John Bushnell’s almost embarrassed desperation for Bert to succeed where he’d failed. Playing Charles Burnell, Geoffrey Palmer was, as ever, hard to beat for lugubrious gruffness." and concluded his review with "anybody whose eyes didn’t join Bushnell Snr’s in filling with tears is stronger than me.

Ponoka-Calmar Oils v Wakefield

Ponoka-Calmar Oils v Wakefield is notable for being the last ruling rendered by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council with respect to an appeal from the courts of Canada. The central issue concerned the construction of statutes relating to mechanic's liens and how they attach to land and the oil and gas severed from it, which issue had generated conflicting rulings in the Canadian courts.
Background.
Earl F. Wakefield Company had entered into an arrangement with Harding and McMullen and commenced drilling an oil well before 10 September 1949. On 19 September, Harding and McMullen incorporated Oil City Petroleums (Leduc) Ltd., which entered into a formal contract with Wakefield on the matter. On 24 September, Oil City entered into an agreement with other companies (including the assignee of the oil lease in the property) and H. and M., therein described as "agents", wherein it was recited that the latter "have assisted in arranging for the drilling of the said wells" and Oil City covenanted to "commence to drill or cause to be commenced to be drilled" the well which had in fact been commenced by the plaintiff. Drilling was suspended on 23 September by Wakefield because of non-payment by Oil City, and Wakefield registered mechanic's liens in October 1949 and commenced actions within the time limit prescribed.
About three months after the cessation of work, arrangements were made with others under which the well was completed and brought into production. In June 1950, a receiver was appointed to sell the oil won, and, subject to stated deductions, to deposit the proceeds in a special trust account to the credit of the action. The plaintiff's action did not come to trial until more than six years had elapsed from the registration of the lien, and no renewal statement had been filed as required by what was then s. 29(7) of "The Mechanics' Lien Act" of Alberta.
The courts below.
In the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, McLaurin C.J.T.D. held that the lien was valid, and duly entered judgment against all defendants. On appeal to the Appellate Division, the judgment was reversed. In the majority ruling by Porter J.A., it was held that there was no evidence that disclosed facts that supported the plaintiff's entitlement to any of the moneys held by the trustee. A concurring ruling by McBride and Johnson JJ.A. held that if such liens did arise they had ceased to exist before the date of the trial of the action, by reason of the failure of the appellant to file a renewal statement as required by the Act.
The Appellate Division's ruling was overturned on appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, which held:
Ponoka-Calmar Oils Ltd. and American Leduc Petroleums Limited were assignees of some of the oil leases on which drilling had taken place, and were respondents in the action at hand. They appealed the issue of their liability in the matter to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.
Ruling by the Privy Council.
In a ruling delivered by Viscount Simonds, it was held that the SCC's ruling was correct. Because of the nature of the agreements that had been executed, both appellants were considered to be "owners" within the meaning of the Alberta Act, and were thus included within the liability for the liens that had attached.

The Snake in the Thorn Bush

The Snake in the Thorn Bush is a rare fable of Greek origin with a West Asian analogue. It is numbered 96 among Aesop's Fables in the Perry Index. In Greek sources, a snake entwined in a thorn hedge is swept away by a flood and mocked by a fox with the words 'A wicked ship, and worthy of its sailor!' The moral drawn is that the evil come to grief from the company they keep. The West Asian variant occurs in the story of Ahikar, where the sage reproaches his adopted nephew for treacherously returning evil for good: 'Thou hast been to me as a snake that wound itself round a bramble and fell into a river. A wolf saw it and said: Lo the evil is mounted on the evil, and evil that which drives them along.' In later, less reliable versions, the snake rebukes the wolf for the animals that it has snatched, making it a fable of the pot calling the kettle black type.

Bratzillaz (House of Witchez)

Bratzillaz (House of Witchez) is an American line of fashion dolls released by MGA Entertainment in 2012. The dolls, a spin-off of the company's popular franchise Bratz. Bratzillaz are witches with special powers that make each character unique. The Bratzillaz girls are cousins of the Bratz and most of the characters have a similar name to a Bratz character. Starting with the Summer/Fall 2013 doll lines, MGA began to use "House of Witchez" in the main logo to express the Bratzillaz's "witchy" nature. The commercials for the "Back to Magic" and "Witchy Princesses" lines never said Bratzillaz in them, only "House of Witchez".
Due to the hiatus that MGA is taking in 2014 to re-build the Bratz' popularity, Bratzillaz are most likely not going to return until 2015 along with the Bratz. But, due to information on 2014 international Bratz and nothing on new Bratzillaz, it may be that MGA scrapped Bratzillaz entirely.
Dolls.
Each doll (with the exception of the Core (Basic Line) dolls) has glass eyes with an articulated, posable body. The dolls come with a broom hair brush, and some come with a spell scroll and a doll stand. Some have a unique pet, sold separately, and most have a personal witch mark symbol. Character cards come with the first edition dolls. They reveal Augmented Reality content when held up to a webcam: virtual doll animation and character video. The Core (Basic Line) dolls are part of an inexpensive budget line and have a non-articulated body and painted eyes as opposed to the usual glass eyes.

Microbial food cultures

Microbial food cultures are live bacteria, yeasts or moulds used in food production. Microbial food cultures carry out the fermentation process in foodstuffs. Used by humans since the Neolithic period (around 10 000 years BC) fermentation helps to preserve perishable foods and to improve their nutritional and organoleptic qualities (in this case, taste, sight, smell, touch). As of 1995, fermented food represented between one quarter and one third of food consumed in Central Europe. More than 260 different species of microbial food culture are identified and described for their beneficial use in fermented food products globally, showing the importance of their use.
The scientific rationale of the function of microbes in fermentation started to be built with the discoveries of Louis Pasteur in the second half of the 19th century. Extensive scientific study continues to characterize microbial food cultures traditionally used in food fermentation taxonomically, physiologically, biochemically and genetically. This allows better understanding and improvement of traditional food processing and opens up new fields of applications.
Historical overview.
Microorganisms are the earliest form of life on earth, first evolving more than three billion years ago. Our ancestors discovered how to harness the power of microorganisms to make new foods, even if they did not know the science behind what they were doing.
Milestones
1665—Robert Hooke and Antoni Van Leeuwenhoek first observe and describe microorganisms.
1857–1876—Louis Pasteur proves the function of microorganisms in lactic and alcoholic fermentation.
1881—Emil Christian Hansen isolates "Saccharomyces carlsbergensis", a pure yeast culture, which is today widely used in brewing of lager beers.
1889–1896—Herbert William Conn, Vilhelm Storch and Hermann Weigmann demonstrate that bacteria are responsible for the acidification of milk and of cream.
1897—Eduard von Freudenreich isolates "Lactobacillus brevis".
1919—Sigurd Orla-Jensen classifies lactic acid bacteria on the basis of the bacteria's physiological response patterns.
Starting from 1970s—production of first industrial concentrated cultures, frozen or freeze-dried cultures, for the direct inoculation of processed milk, improving the regularity of production processes.
Function of microbial food cultures in food.
Microbial food cultures preserve food through formation of inhibitory metabolites such as organic acid (lactic acid, acetic acid, formic acid, propionic acid), ethanol, bacteriocins, etc., often in combination with decrease of water activity (by drying or use of salt). Further, microbial food cultures help to improve food safety through inhibition of pathogens or removing of toxic compounds. Microbial food cultures also improve the nutritional value and organoleptic quality of the food.
The microbial food cultures used in food fermentation can be divided into three major groups: bacteria, yeasts and moulds.
Bacteria.
Bacterial food cultures can be divided into starter cultures and probiotics.
Starter cultures have mainly a technological function in the food manufacturing. They are used as food ingredients at one or more stages in the food manufacturing process and develop the desired metabolic activity during the fermentation or ripening process. They contribute to the one or multiple unique properties of a foodstuff especially in regard to taste, flavour, colour, texture, safety, preservation, nutritional value, wholesomeness and/or health benefits.
Probiotics have a functional role, which refers to the ability of certain microbes to confer health benefits to the consumer.
Generally, the bacteria used as starter culture are not the same used as probiotics. There are however cases when one bacterium can be used both as starter culture and as probiotic. The scientific community is presently trying to deepen understanding of the roles played by microbes in food processing and human health.
The most important bacteria in food manufacturing are "Lactobacillus" species, belonging to the group of lactic acid bacteria.
Bacterial food cultures are responsible for the aroma, taste and texture of cheeses and fermented milk products such as yogurts, ayran, doogh, skyr or ymer. They contribute to developing the flavour and colour of such fermented products as salami, pepperoni and dried ham. Lactic acid bacteria converts the unstable malic acid that is naturally present in wine into the stable lactic acid. This malolactic fermentation gives the stability that is characteristic of high-quality wines that improve on storage.
Lactic acid bacteria are also used in food supplements as probiotics which help to restore the balance in human intestinal biota.
Yeasts.
The most familiar yeast in food production, "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", has been used in brewing and baking for thousands of years.
"S. cerevisiae" feeds on the sugars present in the bread dough and produces the gas carbon dioxide. This forms bubbles within the dough, causing it to expand and the bread to rise.
Several different yeasts are used in brewing beer, where they ferment the sugars present in malted barley to produce alcohol. One of the most common is "S. cerevisiae". The same strain of "S. cerevisiae" which can also be used in breadmaking is used to make ale-type beers. It is known as a top-fermenting yeast because it creates a foam on the top of the brew. Bottom-fermenting yeasts, such as "S. pastorianus", are more commonly used to make lagers. They ferment more of the sugars in the mixture than top-fermenting yeasts, which gives a cleaner taste.
The alcohol in wine is formed by the fermentation of the sugars in grape juice, with carbon dioxide as a by-product. Yeast is naturally present on grapeskins, and this alone can be sufficient for the fermentation of sugars to alcohol to occur. A pure yeast culture, most often "S. cerevisiae", is usually added to ensure the fermentation is reliable. Other yeast cultures like "Pichia", "Torulaspora" and "Kluyveromyces" are naturally present or added to create special flavours in the wine. Sparkling wine, including champagne, is made by adding further yeast to the wine when it is bottled. The carbon dioxide formed in this second fermentation is trapped as bubbles.
Yeasts are also used to produce kefir products, semi-soft ripened cheeses and fermented soy drinks.
Moulds.
Three main types of cheese rely on moulds for their characteristic properties: blue cheese, soft ripened cheese (such as camembert and brie) and rind-washed cheese (such as époisses and taleggio).
To make blue cheese, the cheese is treated with a mould, usually "Penicillium roqueforti", while it is still in the loosely pressed curd form. As the cheese matures, the mould grows, creating blue veins within it which gives the cheese its characteristic flavour. Examples include stilton, roquefort and gorgonzola.
Soft ripened cheese such as brie and camembert are made by allowing "P. camemberti" to grow on the outside of the cheese, which causes them to age from the outside in. The mould forms a soft white crust, and the interior becomes runny with a strong flavour.
Rind-washed cheeses like limburger also ripen inwards, but here, as the name suggests, they are washed with brine and other ingredients such as beer and wine which contain mould. This also makes them attractive to bacteria, which add to the flavour.
Traditionally, inoculations of sausages with moulds were done with the indigenous biota of the slaughters. Different moulds (such as "P. chrysogenum" and "P. nalgiovense") can be used to ripen surfaces of sausages. The mould cultures develop the aroma and improve the texture of the sausages. They also contribute to shortening of the ripening period and preserving the natural quality. This expands the shelf life of the meat product.
In the past, soy sauce has been made by mixing soybeans and other grains with a mould ("Aspergillus oryzae" or "A. sojae") and yeast. This mixture was then left to ferment in the sun. Today soy sauce is made under controlled conditions. The key flavour ingredients formed in this process are salts of the amino acid glutamic acid, notably monosodium glutamate.
Production of microbial food cultures.
The industrial production of microbial food cultures is carried out after careful selection process and under strictly controlled conditions. First, the microbiology laboratory, where the original strains are kept, prepares the inoculation material, which is a small quantity of microbes of a single (pure) strain. Then, the inoculation material is multiplied and grown either in fermenters (liquid) or on a surface (solid) under defined and monitored conditions. Grown cells of pure culture are harvested, eventually blended with other cultures and, finally, formulated (preserved) for subsequent transportation and storage. They are sold in liquid, frozen or freeze-dried formats.
Another and traditional way of starting a food fermentation is often referred to as spontaneous fermentation. Cultures come from raw milk, i.e. milk that has not undergone any sanitation treatment or from the reuse of a fraction of the previous production (back-slopping). The composition of such cultures is complex and extremely variable. The use of such techniques is steadily decreasing in developed countries. Some countries even prohibit the back-slopping technique because of the "potential to magnify pathogen loads to very dangerous levels".
Safety and regulatory aspects.
Microbial food cultures are considered as traditional food ingredients and are permitted in the production of foodstuffs all over the world under general food laws.
Commercially available microbial food cultures are sold as preparations, which are formulations, consisting of concentrates of one or more microbial species and/or strains including unavoidable media components carried over from the fermentation and components, which are necessary for their survival, storage, standardisation and to facilitate their application in the food production process.
Safety of microbial food cultures, depending on their characteristics and use, can be based on genus, species or strain levels.
Microorganisms with documented history of safe use in food.
The first (non-exhaustive) inventory of microorganisms with a documented history of use in food was for the first time compiled in 2001 by the International Dairy Federation (IDF) and the European Food and Feed Cultures Association (EFFCA).
In 2012, this inventory was updated. It now covers a wide range of food applications (including dairy, fish, meat, beverages and vinegar) and features a reviewed taxonomy of microorganisms.
US.
In the United States of America, microbial food cultures are regulated under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Section 409 of the 1958 Food Additives Amendment of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, exempts from the definition of food additives substances generally recognized by experts as safe (GRAS) under conditions of their intended use. These substances do not require premarket approval by the US Food and Drug Administration.
Because there are various ways to obtain GRAS status for microbial food cultures, there is no exhaustive list of microbial food cultures having GRAS status in the US.
European Union.
Within the European Union, microbial food cultures are regarded as food ingredients and are regulated by Regulation 178/2002, commonly referred to as the General Food Law.
Since 2007, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has been maintaining a list of microorganisms having qualified presumption of safety (QPS). The QPS list covers only a limited number of microorganisms, which have been referred to EFSA for safety assessment. It has been conceived as an internal evaluation tool for microorganisms used in the food production chain (e.g. feed cultures, cell factories producing enzymes or additives, plant protection) that need an evaluation by EFSA scientific panels before being marketed in the EU. Microbial food cultures with a long history of safe use are however considered to be traditional food ingredients and are legally permitted for use in human food without EFSA evaluation.
Denmark.
From 1974 to 2010 Denmark required premarket approval of microbial food cultures. The positive list of microbial food cultures is available on the website of the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration.
In 2010, the regulation changed. Approval is no longer needed but a notification should be made to the Veterinary and Food Administration.

Stephen Northup

Stephen Northup (roughly 1630 – after 1687) was an early settler of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and built what may be the oldest house still standing in Rhode Island. Northup was a fairly early settler of Providence in the Rhode Island colony, but accounts claiming that he settled the area with Roger Williams are inaccurate, since Northup was an infant or child when Williams first came to Providence in the spring of 1636. Northup lived in Providence from 1655 to 1666, after which he moved to the Narragansett country (what is now North Kingstown, Rhode Island), which land was claimed by both the Rhode Island and Connecticut colonies. He may have owned or operated a grist mill, and is credited with building a house that still stands and is used as a private residence. Northup was married, had six known children, and lived until at least 1687, when he was taxed.
Providence.
The origins of Stephen Northup are unknown. Published sources are silent as to his provenance, but online sources have offered two possibilities. One is that he was born in 1633 as the son of Hampton Northup of Flintshire, Wales. The other is that he was born in 1625, the son of Henry Northup of Whaddon, Cambridgeshire, England.
Though there is no marriage record, and the name of his wife does not appear in any public record, online sources indicate that Northup married about 1654 Elizabeth Harrington, the daughter of Benjamin Harrington, and Chappell also says that his wife was a daughter of Benjamin Harrington. Austin's "Genealogical Dictionary of Rhode Island" does not show a Benjamin Harrington, but does show a Benjamin Hearnden with wife Elizabeth and nine children, but no daughter Elizabeth. There is a connection between the Northup and Hearnden families that may prove to be significant. In southern North Kingstown Rhode Island is a cemetery that is called the Ancient Northup Burial Ground (Rhode Island Historic Cemetery North Kingstown #51), and though most of the graves are only marked with field stones, there are some Northups that have inscribed markers, and there is also a crude handwritten inscription on a marker that reads "Ebenezer Hearrandain, desesed June 17, 1713. He worse borne June 21, 1681." The spelling leaves open the interpretation that the surname could be either Harrington or Hearnden; however, the "Genealogical Dictionary of Rhode Island" shows this Ebenezer to be a grandson of Benjamin "Hearnden". So, here is a connection between the two families that lends credence to the supposition that Northup's wife may have been a Hearnden, and not a Harrington. To make the case more plausible, Staples, in 1843, published a list of 28 early Providence settlers who each received 25 acres of land, beginning in 1646. On the list of names is Stephen Northup, as well as Benjamin "Herendeen," the latter with his name signed by a mark, this very likely being Northup's father-in-law.
The list in Staples' book giving the names of some early Providence settlers is dated "The 19th of 11 mo. 1645," which means 19 January 1646, since in the Julian calendar in use, March was the first month, and January the 11th. The list consists of 28 individuals "whose names are hereafter subscribed, having obtained a free grant of Twenty-five acres of land, apiece..." However, Staples then notes that "The appearance of the signatures to the original document indicates they were not made at the same time." Staples states that adjustments, written in the margin, were made to the original agreement "after the establishment of the Commonwealth of England," which took place in 1649 and lasted until 1660. Therefore, the placement of Northup's name on the document may have taken place at a date later than 1646. The next record indicates that it was later, in fact many years later. With the exception of the preceding document, the first time Northup's name appears in a public record is on 2 October 1655 when "the town meetinge of Providence, in the Colony of Rhode Island, granted to Stephen Northup, twenty-five acres of land," and this, therefore, should be considered his earliest arrival in Providence.
On 27 August 1656, at another town meeting, "it was ordered that Stephen Northup have a home-lot laid out to him over against Christopher Smith's lot; also, that he have commonage equal to any other townsman; and that he be allowed to vote with the other inhabitants of the town." He built his house at the north end of the town, between the main street and the Moshassuck River. Austin states that he was made a freeman in Providence in 1658, but this may just mean that his name appears on a list of freemen, because he had already been given the privilege of voting two years earlier. On 27 July 1659 Northup sold 60 acres of land at Rocky Hill to William Carpenter, and on 4 June 1660 he was selected as the Town Sergeant for Providence. During his service as sergeant John Clawson, a Dutchman and protege of Roger Williams, was murdered by an Indian not far from Northup's house. Northup then went about "warning the town about the prisoner," and was paid three shillings for his efforts. Northup spent four days taking the prisoner to Newport and attending the trial.
In 1662 Northup sold all of his rights to land between the Pawtucket and Pawtuxet Rivers to William Hawkins, and in 1665 he obtained a lot in a division of lands in Providence. The last record for him in Providence occurred when on 28 March 1666 he witnessed a deed there, but two months later his name does not appear on a list of those in Providence taking an oath of allegiance to the King, thus he had likely moved to Kingstowne by then.
Kingstowne.
After leaving Providence, Northup moved to the Narragansett country, which was organized as Kingstowne in 1674, and later split into North Kingstown and South Kingstown in 1722, the former being where Northup lived. On 19 May 1671 he took the oath of allegiance here, and in August 1672 he was called to appear before the Connecticut court. The Narraganset country was in dispute between the Connecticut and Rhode Island colonies, and both jurisdictions claimed these lands. Northup's reply to the Connecticut court was, "I denie to obey any warrant from ye authority of Conecticot; if ye government of Roade Island send any I will obey them but not this warrant nor any from Conecticot Colony." Sometime in the 1660s or 1670s Northup had purchased some of the Pettaquamscutt lands from Samuel Wilbur and other Pettaquamscutt purchasers. Title to the land was in dispute with the Humphrey Atherton Company, but on 5 December 1679 Northup and others were entitled to keep their lands. Northup had 120 acres of land on the west side of Pettaquamscot Pond, not far from the Gilbert Stuart Birthplace. He is last found in the public record in September 1687 when he was taxed 5s 1/2 d.
There are so few extant records concerning Stephen Northup in Kingstowne, that much of the portrayal of his life there is anecdotal. For instance, his occupation does not appear in any existing records, but a family researcher in the 1930s, Lester Burgess, wrote this: "The Northups owned or operated the grist mill at the Gilbert Stuart place, the foundations of which are now (1939) barely visible. I believe the first dam there was built by old Stephen Northup." The story of the Stephen Northup house is just as enigmatic. While the plaque affixed to the outside of the house clearly reads "1660," this date is problematical for two reasons, the first being that in 1675 and 1676 there was a devastating war in the area, and most historians agree that all houses south of Providence were destroyed during the war, with the noted exception of John Smith's stone-built "castle" in Warwick. The second reason is that Northup's residence in Providence continued at least through 1666, and there is no record of him in Kingstowne before 1671. There doesn't appear to be any documentary evidence supporting the 1660 construction of the house. The National Park Service, in their report on historic North Kingstown properties, only gives a general timeframe for the house's construction: "The Stephen Northup House at 99 Featherbed Lane is another house in which the seventeenth-century core has been preserved by an eighteenth-century addition." North Kingstown historian, Tim Cranston, gives the date of the house as "1680-1690s" with additions made in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Family.
Austin only attributes four children to Northup and his wife, but Chappell adds two more. Of the six children that have been credited to the couple, the oldest was likely Stephen (1660-1733), who married Mary Thomas of Jamestown and had eight children. The next son, Benjamin (1662-1750), married in 1681 Susannah Almy. He was originally buried in a small family plot on land that belonged to Wilbur Hazard, but was, before 1880, moved to Elm Grove Cemetery. However, the Elm Grove Cemetery book shows no record of his being buried there, so his marker may be defunct or illegible, or else he may not have had a marker moved to the new burial location.
The next son, Henry (1663-1740) married Mary Kingsley and had four known children. The only daughter, Mary, married John Mowry and died in 1724. The next son, Joseph (died before 1726) married Hopestill Smith, the daughter of John Smith and Phillis Gereardy, and the couple had five children. David, the presumed youngest son, (died in 1725) married Susanna Congdon, the daughter of Benjamin Congdon and Elizabeth Albro, and the granddaughter of Major John Albro who was an early magistrate of the colony. David and Susanna had four known children.
Northup is an ancestor of Stephen Arnold Douglas, who sparred with Abraham Lincoln in a series of famous debates in 1858, prior to a senate race, and later lost to him in the 1860 presidential election.

Notes.
a. The family name is NOT "Northrup", as appears in several accounts. The Rhode Island family, descendants of Stephen Northup, has always spelled the name "Northup".

Barry Cheung

Barry Cheung Chun-yuen, GBS, JP (, born 15 February 1958 in Zhucheng, Shandong, China) is a Hong Kong businessman. Cheung is a former Non-official member of the Executive Council of Hong Kong, a chairman of Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange (HKMEx), and a chairman of Urban Renewal Authority since 2007.
Cheung resigned from his official duties on 24 May 2013 amidst controversy over the suspension of HKMEx by the securities regulator and allegations of possible irregularities at the exchange. The government has announced that Cheung is under police investigation.
Education and work.
Cheung holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Sussex and an MBA from the Harvard Business School.
Cheung worked for the management consultancy McKinsey & Company; he was also a member of the Central Policy Unit of the Hong Kong government in 1993. In 1994, he left McKinsey to become chief executive of London Stock Exchange-listed Fortune Oil, a commodity trading company operating in mainland China. The company fared well under Cheung's stewardship. It expanded into jet fuel supply at two airports. However, the Asian financial crisis in 1998 caused oil prices to fall by a third. In early 1999 Fortune announced a loss of US$59.9 million. It had to seek $20 million in extra funding. After the recapitalisation in 1999, Cheung left Fortune. In 2004, Cheung was appointed chief executive of HKSE-listed Titan Petrochemical, which invested in oil tankers; Cheung resigned in 2008.
Cheung reportedly has close ties to Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, who was an early investor in HKMEx. Cheung served briefly as chairman of Deripaska's aluminium company United Company RUSAL. He has also served as a non-executive director of Hong Kong life insurer AIA, and was chairman of the newly built Harrow International School in Hong Kong.
Cheung was appointed to the board of the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) in 2001, and became its chairman on 24 April 2007. Cheung was an early backer of C Y Leung when the latter declared his candidacy for Hong Kong chief executive; Cheung managed the election campaign in 2012. He became an executive councillor in the CY Leung's first administration.
HK Mercantile Exchange.
Cheung launched the Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange in June 2008 as a trading platform. He was the chairman and majority shareholder, with a 56% stake. The exchange has been persistently loss-making. Competitive pressure got worse upon HKSE's acquisition of the London Metal Exchange in the second half of 2012.
On 22 May 2013, Cheung took a leave of absence from his official duties after HKMEx folded and after the Securities and Futures Commission found "serious" suspected irregularities there that resulted in a police investigation and several arrests. Cheung has denied that the arrested persons were employees of HKMEx.
Cheung resigned his RUSAL and AIA directorships following the announcement that he was under police investigation. He resigned from all his official positions, including his membership of the Executive Council and the URA, on 24 May 2013, when he became subject to a criminal investigation upon the collapse of the exchange.

Military funerals in the United States

A military funeral in the United States is a memorial or burial rite given by the U.S. military for a soldier, Marine, sailor or airman who died in battle, a veteran, or other prominent military figures or a president. A military funeral may feature guards of honor, the firing of volley shots as a salute, drumming and other military elements, with a flag draping over the coffin.
In the United States, the United States Army Military District of Washington (MDW) is responsible for providing military funerals. "Honoring Those Who Served" is the title of the program for instituting a dignified military funeral with full honors to the nation's veterans.
As of January 1, 2000, Section 578 of Public Law 106-65 of the National Defense Authorization Act mandates that the United States Armed Forces shall provide the rendering of honors in a military funeral for any eligible veteran if requested by his or her family. As mandated by federal law, an honor guard detail for the burial of an eligible veteran shall consist of no less than two members of the Armed Forces. One member of the detail shall be a representative of the parent armed service of the deceased veteran. The honor guard detail will, at a minimum, perform a ceremony that includes the folding and presenting of the flag of the United States to the next of kin and the playing of "Taps" which will be played by a lone bugler, if available, or by audio recording. Today, there are so few buglers available that the United States Armed Forces often cannot provide one. However, federal law allows Reserve and National Guard units to assist with funeral honors duty when necessary.
Eligibility.
Generally, federal law allows for military funeral honors for all veterans who were discharged under circumstances "other than dishonorable." Funeral directors will require the veteran's DD Form 214 to establish eligibility.
Those who are eligible for military funerals and full honors in the United States include the following:
Ceremony.
In the United States, there are several types of military funerals such as those performed at Arlington National Cemetery, which include and omit certain components depending on the status of the deceased (active, retired, veteran, rank/occupation).
Standard honor military funerals include the following:
Full honor military funerals include all standard honors in addition to the following:
Armed forces military funerals include all standard and full honors in addition to the following:
When a spouse or other dependent of a current or former member of the United States Armed Forces is buried, the military service in which the primary party served will provide a casket team and a chaplain. No other military honors will be rendered unless the spouse served in the military.
The flag of the United States draped over the casket is meticulously folded twelve times by a total of six honor guards, three on each side of the casket.
Often, three spent shell-casings, each representing one of three volleys, are slipped into the folds of the flag before its presentation to the next of kin. When the flag is completely folded, the stars point upwards, which remind Americans of their national motto, "In God We Trust". After the flag is completely folded and tucked in, it takes on the appearance of a bicorne hat, reminding Americans of the soldiers who served under General George Washington, and the sailors and Marines who served under Captain John Paul Jones, who were followed by their comrades and shipmates in the United States Armed Forces.
An honor guard composed of one or more branches of the United States Armed Forces, presents the flag to the next of kin. The presenter, if possible a member of the same service as the deceased, will generally kneel while presenting the folded flag, with the straight edge of the flag facing the recipient. The presenter then recites the following wording, which was standardized on April 20, 2012:
Ramp ceremonies.
A "ramp ceremony" is a memorial ceremony, not an actual funeral, for a soldier killed in a war zone held at an airfield near or in a location where an airplane is waiting nearby to take the deceased's remains to his or her home country. The term has been in use since about 2005 and became common during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Doxocopa pavon

Doxocopa pavon, commonly known as the Pavon Emperor or Pavon, is a species of butterfly in the Nymphalidae family. They can be found from Paraguay in South America up to Texas in the southern United States. They are generally brown in their overall coloration, with two bands of white straddling the middle of the upper surfaces of the wings, and a patch of orange on the tips of their forewings. The upper surfaces of the wings of the males are overlaid by an iridescent blue-purple sheen. The females of the species closely resemble members of the unrelated genus "Adelpha".
The larvae of "Doxocopa pavon" feed on the leaves of hackberries, while the adults are primarily nectar-feeders.
Taxonomy.
"Doxocopa pavon" is classified under the genus "Doxocopa" of the subfamily Apaturinae (emperors) in the brush-footed butterfly family Nymphalidae. It was originally described as "Nymphalis pavon" by the French zoologist Pierre André Latreille in 1809. The type specimen was collected from Loja, Ecuador.
"Doxocopa pavon" is usually divided into two subspecies: "Doxocopa pavon theodora" and the nominal subspecies "Doxocopa pavon pavon". "D. p. theodora" was originally described by the French entomologist Hippolyte Lucas in 1857 as "Apatura theodora". Its type specimen was collected from Fernardina de Jagua, Cuba (now the city of Cienfuegos).
The subspecies was also collected by the French lepidopterist Jean Baptiste Boisduval in 1870 and described as the species "Chlorippe mentas". Several other authors also described it under other names. The German entomologist Hans Fruhstorfer described it as "pavon inumbratus" and "[Chlorippe pavon cuellinia" in 1907, with specimens collected from Paraguay and Mexico respectively. And in 1916, the German entomologist Julius Röber also named it " pavon subtuniformis". The latter names are now considered synonyms and are invalid.
"Doxocopa pavon" are commonly known as the Pavon Emperor, or simply Pavon.
Description.
"Doxocopa pavon" have wingspans between . They are sexually dimorphic, having two distinct forms for the male and female. Both sexes have a small orange patch on the tips of their forewings.
The upper surfaces of the wings of the male of the species are predominantly brown overlaid with a vividly iridescent bluish purple. In the middle of the upper surfaces of both forewings and hindwings is a white band that is usually only barely visible. The undersides of the wings are a pale brown. At the tip of the forewing is a small orange patch.
The female of the species is also predominantly brown on the upper surfaces of the wings, but it lacks the purple coloration of the males. It also has a band of white in the middle of the upper surfaces of both forewings and hindwings. Unlike in the male, this band is very distinct and broad, though it does not touch the front edge of the forewings.
The species closely resembles the Silver Emperor ("Doxocopa laure") but differs in that the undersides of the wings of "D. laure" are covered in a silvery sheen, while it is a plain pale brown in "D. pavon". Both sexes also lack the pointed tips in the hindwings which is present in "D. laure". The males of "D. laure" also have extended forewings with squarish tips and a much larger orange patch than in "D. pavon".
The females of "D. pavon" also closely resemble both sexes of some species of the unrelated genus "Adelpha" (sisters). Particularly the Band-celled Sister ("Adelpha fessonia"), Pointed Sister ("Adelpha iphiclus"), Celerio Sister ("Adelpha serpa"), Bredow's Sister ("Adelpha bredowii"), Arizona Sister ("Adelpha eulalia"), and the California Sister ("Adelpha californica"). They can be distinguished from "A. fessonia" in that the white bands in "D. pavon" never reach the front edge of their forewings. While the white bands in "A. bredowii", "A. californica", and "A. eulalia" are broken into spots on the forward edge of their forewings. "Adelpha" and "Doxocopa" are thought to be part of a large mimicry complex, as some members of "Adelpha" are unpalatable to predators.
Distribution and habitat.
This species occurs from Bolivia and Paraguay in South America to northern Mexico in North America. At times, it can also be found in the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas. The subspecies "D. p. theodora" has a more limited range, being found in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.
They are generally found in tropical and subtropical forests (including rainforests) at altitudes of about above sea level.
Life cycle and ecology.
The larvae of "D. pavon" are green with yellow-white dots running along their sides, and an indistinct series of yellow-white blotches on the upper surface. The body tapers strongly towards a pointed tail. The head is green with black eyes and black mandibles. Two white and black stripes on the front also extend up towards the two long, forward-projecting horns. The horns are green with a forked black tip. The larvae feed on the leaves of hackberries (genus "Celtis"). In the United States, they are usually found on the desert hackberry ("Celtis pallida"), while in Mexico they can be found on the iguana hackberry ("Celtis iguanaea").
The chrysalis is camouflaged as a leaf, similar to that of other members of the subfamily. It's greenish in color, strongly arched, flattened laterally and with ridges running along the abdomen. The adults feed on nectar; including those from the flowers of bocotes (genus "Cordia") and rushfoils (genus "Croton"). They can also be commonly found in sunlit areas in forests engaging in mud-puddling on moist mineral-laden soil or rock, rotting fruit, carrion, or bird droppings. The males are the most often encountered, as they have a habit of perching on trees in full sunlight (especially at midday) waiting for females. Females, however, are more rarely seen as they spend most of their time in the forest canopy.
Conservation.
The species is considered secure globally (G5) by NatureServe, though it might be rare near the boundaries of its range.
In Guatemala, the species is listed under the country's local wildlife red list due to low-level hunting by butterfly collectors (averaging at 3 specimens a month).

Jason Sturgeon

Jason Sturgeon is an American country music artist born and raised in Petersburg, Indiana. He has released two albums via Toolpusher Records.
Biography.
Sturgeon grew up in a family of coal miners, oilmen and farmers. His creative side helped to balance out his love for the outdoors.
Along with music, he enjoyed jockeying, as his grandparents on his mothers’ side had thoroughbreds. He eventually started racing in AQHA open horse shows and placed 8th in the World Championship Show in Oklahoma City and 4th in the Quarter Horse Congress in Columbus, Ohio. From 15 until 19 during the summers, he worked in the oilfields for his family and learned to build, renovate, and basically do anything that needed to be done around the farm.
After high school Jason planned to head to Nashville, Tennessee but his father convinced him to attend college at Vincennes University first and learn a trade, just in case. He earned his degree's and became a medical device engineer for Cook Medical in Bloomington, Indiana.
After graduating from Vincennes University, he moved to Nashville to pursue his music career. Soon after moving to Nashville, he began touring, spending the majority of his first two years touring. His rapid city-to-city lifestyle inspired one of his hits "Time Bomb," a song about always being at a different venue in a different state. While he loved being on the road, he realized that he needed to settle down. He had plenty of experiences to write about after his time on the road. In 2012, Sturgeon played over 200 shows, and in 2013, he's on pace to top even that. In his 200+ shows during 2012, he opened for the likes of Gary Allan, Brooks & Dunn, Rodney Atkins, Luke Bryan, and Dierks Bentley, among others.
Music career.
The band opened for artists like Brooks & Dunn, Rodney Atkins, Luke Bryan and others who were coming through the area, and they even released their own CD in 2008. Tapped to be part of Kenny Chesney’s “Next Big Star” competition, Sturgeon continued as a solo act. He traveled to Nashville but returned to Indiana until he received a phone call from Dane Clark, a member of John Mellencamp’s band.
He released "That's Me" in 2010. "Cornfields & Coal" followed in September 2013.

Zaderc

Zaderc (; also "Zadrc", ) is a former settlement in the Municipality of Kočevje in southern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. Its territory is now part of the village of Brezovica pri Predgradu. The Zaderc Spring () is located 1 km southwest of Zaderc.
Name.
The origin of the name "Zaderc" is uncertain; the Slovene linguist France Bezlaj tentatively suggested that it may be a fused prepositional phrase, derived from "*za-dorьcь". The German name "Saderz" is derived from the Slovene name.
History.
Zaderc was a village inhabited by Gottschee Germans. Sources vary on whether the village had a Slovene minority or a Slovene majority. A 1936 survey stated that the Slovenes living in Zaderc had been Germanized and were only weakly conscious of their ethnic Slovene identity. Zaderc was not listed in the Gottschee land registry of 1574, in the 1770 census, or in Karl Julius Schröer's 1870 dictionary because it was formerly administratively part of the Dominion of Poljane instead of Gottschee County. The village had three farms in 1576. Before the Second World War, the main activity in the village was farming and peddling, and the village had 15 houses and a population between 33 and 37. The original inhabitants of the village were expelled in October 1941, and the village was later burned. In 1953 it was inhabited by two Roma families (Brajdič and Hudorovac), who worked at the gravel pit at Čeplje.
Cultural heritage.
The ruins of a chapel dedicated to Saint Francis Xavier are located in Zaderc. The chapel was destroyed during the Second World War. The ruins are located east of the crossroads in the settlement. The chapel dated from the mid-18th century and had an octagonal altar section walled on three sides and a stone portico. The outer walls of the chapel are preserved as well as the linden tree that stood next to it. The site is heavily overgrown.

Clay Street Bridge

The Clay Street Bridge is a bridge on the Passaic River between Newark and East Newark, New Jersey. The swing bridge is the 13th bridge from the river's mouth at Newark Bay and is upstream from it. Opened in 1903, the Warren through truss rim-bearing bridge was substantially rehabilitated in 1975-1976, its original working parts now part of the collection of the Newark Museum. It is listed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places (ID#5153) and is eligible for the National Register of Historic Places.
The lower of the 90-mile (140 km) long Passaic River downstream of the Dundee Dam is tidally influenced and navigable. The Clay Street Bridge was built to replace an 1889 wrought iron structure. It is one of three functional vehicular and pedestrian swing bridges in the city, the others being the Jackson Street Bridge and the Bridge Street Bridge. Since 1998, rules regulating drawbridge operations require a four-hour notice for them to be opened, which occurs infrequently.
At its eastern end Clay Street Bridge enters the Clark Thread Company Historic District, crossing the river at a point which remains in use for industry, manufacturing, and distribution. The western end enters the neighborhood of Newark sometimes known as South Broadway. The US Army Corps of Engineers is undertaking restoration and rehabilitation of the Lower Passaic, including oversight of environmental remediation and reconstruction of bulkheads. In 2012, the New Jersey Department of Transportation allocated funds for the reconstruction of the bridge.

List of birds of the Isle of Man

Over 300 species of bird have been recorded in the wild on the Isle of Man, a self-governing island in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Ireland. Over 100 of them breed there, including significant populations of Red-billed Chough, Peregrine Falcon and Hen Harrier.
A variety of seabirds breed on the coastal cliffs such as Atlantic Puffin, Black Guillemot, Black-legged Kittiwake, European Shag and Northern Fulmar. The island gives its name to the Manx Shearwater which formerly nested in large numbers on the Calf of Man. The colony disappeared following the arrival of rats but the shearwaters began to return in the 1960s. The Ayres in the north of the island have colonies of Little Tern, Arctic Tern and Common Tern.
Moorland areas on the island are home to Red Grouse, Eurasian Curlew and Northern Raven. Woodland birds include Long-eared Owl, Common Treecreeper, Eurasian Blackcap and Common Chiffchaff. There is little native woodland on the island and several species found in Great Britain, such as Tawny Owl, Eurasian Green Woodpecker and Eurasian Jay, do not breed on the isle of Man.
Many birds visit the island during the winter and migration seasons including waders such as Purple Sandpiper, Turnstone and Golden Plover. Wintering wildfowl include small numbers of Whooper Swan. A bird observatory was established on the Calf of Man in 1959 to study the migrating and breeding birds. By the end of 2001, 99,042 birds of 134 species had been ringed there. Numerous rarities have been recorded there including American Mourning Dove and White-throated Robin.
The list below includes 323 species of bird. The English names are those recommended by the International Ornithological Congress (IOC) with alternative names given in brackets. The scientific names and classification follow the British Ornithologists' Union (BOU). Species marked as rare are those for which the Manx Ornithological Society (MOS) requires a written description in order to accept a record.
The MOS uses the following codes:
Failed introductions such as Black Grouse or species which are not yet established such as Red-winged Laughingthrush are not included on the list.

Parathuraminacea

Parathuramminacea comprises a superfamily within the foraminiferal order Fusulinida, characterized by tests (shells) that are unilocular, globular to elongate or irregular, or that may consist of a series or cluster of such chambers. Forms are either free or attached.
Parathuramminacea is one of three superfamilies making up the Fusulinina in the "Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology Part C", 1964, but as of 1988 (or prior to) expanded to thirteen. Additional superfamilies being created out of the original three. 
Parathuramminaceans were originally described as Fusulinida that consist of a single glubular or tubular chamber, or cluster of such chambers. Test wall simple, consisting of calcareous granules in calcareous cement. At that time it was divided into the globular Parathuraminidae, tubular or enrolled Caligellidae, and globular to tubular Moravamminidae.

Old Cleveland Road, Brisbane

Old Cleveland Road is a major road in Brisbane, Queensland. It runs from Stones Corner to Capalaba in Brisbane, with most of the route signed as State Route 22. Sections of the road are also part of State Routes 30, 44, and 54. The road is the main route from inner Brisbane to Capalaba and Cleveland since New Cleveland Road only links Tingalpa with Capalaba.
The road provides the quickest access to the suburbs of Capalaba and Carindale from Logan Road and the Gateway Motorway, as well as being a main access road for Westfield Carindale Shopping Centre and Capalaba Central Shopping Centre. When completed the Eastern Busway will run parallel to, and (in some parts) in the middle of, the road so bus patrons can avoid severe peak hour traffic congestion road-wide.
History.
In 1839 and 1841 surveyors James Warner, Granville Stayplton and Robert Dixon were directed by incoming Lieutenant Owen Gorman to prepare the Moreteon Bay Penal Colony for civil administration and private (rather than convict only) occupation. In particular Warner surveyed Norman Creek from (present day) Stones Corner, Hilliard's Creek and Tingalpa Creek to the Brisbane River, suggesting on his survey a road from Coopers Plains (then called Cowpers Plains) to Cleveland Point (the only eligible site that a mooted port could be located) along a line appriximately north of where Old Cleveland Road is today. A subsequent 1841 survey proposed a slightly different alignment, crossing over Tingalpa Creek only once.
In 1849, Major Thomas Mitchell, Surveyor-General of the Colony of New South Wales directed that a town at Cleveland Point be surveyed as per Warner's suggestion in the 1941 survey. Warner submitted his "Survey of a practicable road from Brisbane in the County of Stanley to the proposed Town of Cleveland in the same County" on 22 May 1850, the first definitive plan and (subsequent) construction of a road on the current's approximate alignment. The first sale of blocks of land at Cleveland occurred on August 13, 1851 after Warner submitted a survey of allotments for the new town on 25 April of that same year.
Old Cleveland Road's alignment was variously altered by various surveyors, including Warner and Gould, and the New South Wales and (subsequent) Queensland colonial and State governments until 1961, the route of which remains largely unchanged to this day. Oddly, a 1926 Brisbane City Council map called the road Cleveland Road whilst today's "Mt. Gravatt-Capalaba Road" was labelled by council as "Old Cleveland Road". A 1975 Brisbane City Council proposal to rename the current Old Cleveland Road was halted after the Redland City council objected to the change.
Between 1912 and 1926, part of the Belmont Tramway ran along the road at Carina. Between 1948 and 1969, Brisbane City Council electric trams ran along Old Cleveland Road between Logan Road and Belmont. Approximately of tram track remains in the median strip between Jones Road to Orwell Street in Carina. This remaining tram track is listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.

Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute

The Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute at Washington University School of Law serves as a center for instruction and research in international and comparative law. Through a combination of education and research, the Institute seeks to contribute to the betterment of the global society by expanding the knowledge and understanding of key issues, promoting the rule of law, and addressing the kinds of problems that require international cooperation and collaboration.
The Harris Institute was established in November 2000 as the “Institute for Global Legal Studies” and was later renamed as the “Whitney R. Harris Institute for Global Legal Studies” in honor and recognition of Whitney R. Harris' lifelong achievements in the field of international justice. Whitney R. Harris served as a trial counsel prosecuting the major German war criminals before the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1945 and he kept the Nuremberg dream alive through his writings and his advocacy, and later through his philanthropic generosity and support of legal education and research. In 2008, he and Anna Harris endowed the Institute’s “World Peace Through Law Award” at a ceremony during which the Harris Institute’s name was changed to the “Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute,” the name it bears today.
With a focus on developing innovative global solutions to real-life problems, the Harris Institute has sponsored more than 80 speakers and held or co-sponsored more than 20 major international conferences since it opened. It also houses an “Ambassador-in-Residence” program and hosts debates and scholarship roundtables on pressing issues in international law and policy. By drawing on a vast pool of international and national expertise, the Harris Institute fosters collaboration, continuous dialogue and exchange among scholars and practitioners engaged in international or comparative work.
The Crimes Against Humanity Initiative.
Introduction to the Crimes Against Humanity Initiative.
In 2008, the Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute launched the Crimes Against Humanity Initiative to study the need for a comprehensive international convention on the prevention and punishment of crimes against humanity, analyze the necessary elements of such a convention, and draft a proposed treaty. The Nuremberg Charter delineated three categories of crimes: genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Yet, while the Genocide Convention provides a legal framework for prosecuting perpetrators of genocide, and the Geneva Conventions address war crimes, there is not yet a comprehensive convention on crimes against humanity. As a result, perpetrators continue to escape after committing systematic and widespread human rights violations. The statutes of the International Criminal Court, the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda each contain different definitions of crimes against humanity, further demonstrating the need for a comprehensive convention, which would both punish perpetrators and prevent such atrocities from occurring in the future.
Objectives of the CAH Initiative.
The Crimes Against Humanity Initiative had three primary objectives: (1) to study the law and sociological reality as regards the commission of crimes against humanity; (2) to combat the indifference and the negative legal consequences emergent from the idea that crimes against humanity are less serious than genocide; and (3) to address the gap in the law by elaborating the first-ever comprehensive specialized convention on crimes against humanity. 
The CAH Initiative is carried out in four phases, three of which have been completed. The first phase was to prepare the project in various aspects, including methodological development. The second phase was to conduct a private study through the writing of papers and expert collaboration. This phase resulted in the production of papers which contribute to the body of literature on crimes against humanity. Fifteen of these papers, written by leading experts, were presented and discussed at a conference held at Washington University School of Law on April 13–14, 2009. In March, 2010, a capstone conference at the Brookings Institution in Washington further highlighted the importance of this Initiative in a Declaration on the Need for a Comprehensive Convention on Crimes Against Humanity. 
The third phase of the Initiative resulted in the elaboration and publication of a Proposed International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes Against Humanity in English and French. Nearly 250 experts were consulted and the Proposed Convention underwent seven major revisions. The Proposed Convention builds upon the International Criminal Court statute by retaining the Rome Statute definition of crimes against humanity. It adds additional provisions, drawing on diverse sources of international criminal law. The Proposed Convention is intended to function as a platform for discussion by States with a view toward the eventual adoption of a United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes Against Humanity.
In March 2011, Cambridge University Press published Forging a Convention for Crimes Against Humanity, an edited volume on the work of the Initiative, which contains the text of the Proposed Convention in French and English, a comprehensive history of its drafting, and fifteen expert commentaries from the Expert’s Meeting in April 2009. The book received considerable praise and attention, and was awarded the Book of the Year Award by the Association Internationale de Droit Pénal (American Branch). A second edition, with the text of the convention in Spanish and Arabic, is forthcoming.
The "Proposed Convention" and "Forging a Convention for Crimes Against Humanity".
The Proposed Convention contains 27 articles and 6 annexes. Its text attempts to bring prevention into the instrument in a much more explicit way than predecessor instruments, by including the possibility of responsibility for the criminal acts of legal persons, by excluding defenses of immunities and statutory limitations, by prohibiting reservations, and by establishing a unique institutional mechanism for supervision of the Convention. Echoing its 1907 forbearer, it also contains its own "Martens Clause" in the Preamble.
The Proposed Convention builds upon and complements the ICC Statute by retaining the Rome Statute definition of crimes against humanity, but has added robust interstate cooperation, extradition, and mutual legal assistance provisions in Annexes 2-6. Universal jurisdiction was retained (but is not mandatory), and the Rome Statute served as a model for several additional provisions, including Articles 4-7 (Responsibility, Official Capacity, Non-Application of Statute of Limitations) and with respect to final clauses. Other provisions draw on international criminal law and human rights instruments more broadly, including the Enforced Disappearance Convention, the Terrorist Bombing Convention, the Convention Against Torture, the UN Conventions on Corruption and Organized Crime, the European Transfer of Proceedings Convention, and the Inter-American Criminal Sentences Convention. The Proposed Convention provides for State as well as individual responsibility, and would vest jurisdiction in the International Court of Justice to resolve differences as to interpretation and application of the Proposed Convention.
Current Work of the CAH Initiative.
As part of its fourth and final phase, the Crimes Against Humanity Initiative aims to raise global awareness of the need for an international convention on crimes against humanity, and to encourage the international community to adopt the Proposed Convention. The CAH Initiative has completed translations of the Proposed Convention in French and Spanish, and undertaken Chinese and German translations in order to widen the reach of the Initiative and the Proposed Convention.
The Crimes Against Humanity Steering Committee has also reached out to national and international policy makers to begin a dialog about the strengths and benefits of the Proposed Convention and the responsibility of the international community to prevent and punish crimes against humanity.
Leadership.
The Crimes Against Humanity Initiative is directed by a global Steering Committee of experts and scholars in the field of international criminal law including Professor Leila Nadya Sadat (chairwoman), Professor M. Cherif Bassouni, Ambassador Hans Corell, Justice Richard Goldstone, Professor Juan E. Méndez, Professor William Schabas and Judge Christine Van Den Wyngaert.
The Crimes Against Humanity Initiative also benefits from the expertise of an Advisory Council composed of high-ranking international law and human rights practitioners and scholars from around the world. The Steering Committee assembled the CAH Advisory Council to assist the Initiative in developing strategies for a crimes against humanity treaty and to promote the Proposed Convention.
World Peace Through Law Award.
The World Peace Through Law Award is bestowed upon an individual who, by his or her work and writings, has considerably advanced the rule of law and thereby contributed to world peace. Established in 2006, the Award recognizes individuals who have achieved great distinction in the field of international law and international relations. To date, this award has been bestowed upon four distinguished individuals: 
Other Programs.
ICC Legal Tools Project.
In September 2009, the Harris Institute concluded a Co-Operation Agreement with the International Criminal Court which began the ICC Legal Tools Project. Under the Co-Operation Agreement, the Institute is responsible for collecting and uploading documents for the "National Jurisdictions" and "National Cases Involving Core International Crimes" folders in the ICC Legal Tools database.
The Harris Institute has been researching, collecting, and analyzing relevant domestic legislation and case law concerning genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes for the following States: Albania, Azerbaijan, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Comoros, Georgia, Ghana, Kiribati, Kyrgyzstan, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, Niger, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Swaziland, Tajikistan, Tonga, Tuvalu, Tanzania, Uzbekistan and Zambia.
International Humanitarian Law (IHL) Program.
The Harris Institute International Humanitarian Law (IHL) program provides a unique opportunity to Washington University law students interested in international law field advocacy. In spring 2012, the IHL program entered a new phase and partnership with the Enough! Project. The Washington, D.C. based NGO works with concerned citizens, advocates, and policy makers to prevent, mitigate, and resolve crises of genocide and crimes against humanity. Law students have a unique opportunity to aid in Enough’s Raise Hope for Congo campaign through the Conflict-Free Campus Initiative (CFCI). This Initiative aims to alleviate atrocities committed over conflict minerals in Congo by pressuring electronics companies to use conflict-free minerals in their products.
Ambassadors Program.
Founded in 2007, the Harris Institute Ambassadors Program brings foreign service professionals to the law school to share their experiences and knowledge with the law school and university community. The Ambassadors Program draws current and retired professionals from the international diplomatic corps to provide students with a first-hand description of international law and policy in action.
Former Ambassadors-in-Residence include: Ambassador Stephen J. Rapp (2009), Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues; Ambassador Charles Stith (2009), former United States Ambassador to Tanzania; Ambassador Feisal Amin Rasoul al-Istrabadi (2009), the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, Deputy Permanent Representative of Iraq to the United Nations; Carla A. Hills (2008), former United States Trade Representative; and Thomas A. Schweich (2008), former State Department coordinator for counternarcotics and Justice Reform in Afghanistan.
Dagen-Legomsky Student Fellowship Program.
In 2001, Margaret Dagen–an early pioneer of the civil rights movement in St. Louis–endowed the Dagen-Legomsky Student Fellowship Program for Washington University law students to work in the field of international human rights and to study at the prestigious Hague Academy of International Law during the summer recess. With the financial support of this program, Dagen-Legomsky International Public Interest fellows partake in summer externships at the U.S. Department of Justice, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, the Mekong Region Law Center (Bangkok), and many more.

Gerald W. Thomas

Gerald Waylett Thomas (July 3, 1919 – July 31, 2013) was President Emeritus of New Mexico State University, a veteran of World War II, and an author.
Biography.
Early life.
Gerald W. Thomas was born at home on the Daniel Thomas ranch on Medicine Lodge Creek, Small, Idaho on July 3, 1919. His parents were Daniel Waylett Thomas and Mary Elizabeth Evans. Thomas was the second oldest of six sons.
Education.
Thomas attended the local Medicine Lodge school through the 11th grade, the last grade the school offered. He moved to Pasadena, California and finished high school at John Muir High School. He attended Pasadena Junior College for two years and then obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Forestry in February, 1941, from the University of Idaho, at Moscow, Idaho.
In 1950, he enrolled in Texas A&M University, at College Station, Texas, where he obtained a MS degree in Wildlife Management in 1951 and a Ph.D in Wildlife Management in 1954 (called Range Management then).
Military Service.
On February 5, 1942, Thomas volunteered for the Navy. He passed his "B-check" in a N3N "Yellow Peril" at the “Elimination Base” at Los Alamitos, California, on July 2, 1942. Assigned to Naval Aviation School, Corpus Christi, Texas, he graduated with an Ensign Commission on November 27, 1942. He then received six weeks of dive-bomber training at Naval Air Station Miami in Opa-locka, Florida.
In January, 1943, Thomas was assigned to Torpedo Squadron Four (VT-4) attached to the USS Ranger (CV-4). VT-4 was a 9-plane TBF Avenger unit with 12 pilots and 2 non-flying officers. It was a part of Air Group 4 along with a 16-plane fighter squadron (VF-4) and a 16-plane dive bomber squadron (VB-4).
Thomas' first combat action was Operation Leader, a strike on German shipping along the coast of Norway on October 4, 1943. On that strike, while attacking a freight barge carrying 40 tons of ammunition, Thomas' plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire. The engine began burning and it appeared the plane was going down. Thomas ordered his crew of two to bail out and had just opened the cockpit and was climbing out when his turret gunner yelled, "Don't jump, don't jump." The other crewman had accidentally opened his parachute in the belly of the plane. With bailing no longer possible, Thomas considered his options and decided their best chance was to fly the plane toward the carrier as far as it would go. Surprisingly, in spite of the considerable engine damage, the plane made it back to the Ranger, where Thomas crash-landed. That landing was his 13th official carrier landing.
On June 26, 1944, Air Group 4 was ordered off the Ranger and to the West Coast of the United States for an assignment in the Pacific. After some time on the West Coast and some time training in Hawaii, Air Group 4 was ordered aboard the USS Bunker Hill (CV-17) on November 4, 1944. On the Bunker Hill, Thomas participated in strikes against Ormoc Bay, Manila Bay, and Cavite in the Philippines. During this combat period, Air Group 4 lost seven pilots and four crewmen.
On November 18, 1944, Air Group 4 was assigned to the USS Essex (CV-9). On the Essex, Thomas participated in strikes against Santa Cruz, San Fernando, Lingayen, Mindoro, Clark Field, Aparri, Formosa, French Indo-China, Saigon, Pescadores, Hainan, Amami O Shima, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and Japan. The attack on Japan was the first attack on Japan from an aircraft carrier since the "Doolittle Raid."
While on the Essex, just after Thomas had returned from a strike on Santa Cruz, the ship was hit by a Kamikaze flying a Yokosuka D4Y dive bomber. The Kamikaze attack killed 16 crewmen and wounded 44.
Returning from a strike on Hainan, off the Chinese coast, Thomas' plane ran out of fuel. After a harrowing water landing, Thomas and his crewmen succeeded in inflating and launching rubber boats. After a long day in pre-Typhoon weather with 40 foot swells, they were rescued by the USS Sullivans (DD-537).
On March 2, 1945, Air Group 4 was assigned non-combat duty and transferred off the Essex. Thomas was awarded 3 Distinguished Flying Crosses, 2 Air Medals, and 2 Presidential Unit Citations for his combat actions in WWII.
NMSU President.
Thomas was the 17th NMSU president, and the second longest serving president. When he became president, NMSU had about 900 faculty and the main campus enrollment was about 8,000. By his retirement, the faculty had grown to 1,700 and enrollment was more than 12,500 students. An additional 3,000 students were enrolled at NMSU's four branch campuses.
Death.
Thomas died on July 31, 2013 at age 94.

Power assembly

In Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) parlance, a "Power assembly" is a complete unit, consisting of all major service components in a cylinder, including:
Using a special fixture and ordinary shop tools, an EMD power assembly may be changed within a few hours, requiring no other major engine subsystem disassembly.
The design is central to EMD's maintenance concept, and whether one or all 8, 12, 16 or 20 power assemblies are to be changed, the procedure is the same.
The components within a power assembly may be inspected and may be evaluated without disassembly of any other major components. The use of a fiber optic endoscope (flexible borescope) may facilitate this inspection and evaluation, but this is not a requirement, nor is it a part of EMD's maintenance procedures. All power assembly above-piston structures, including the piston top, may be inspected and evaluated through the scavenging air ports when the piston is at bottom dead center (through the cylinder's "Air Box hand-hole"). Also, the sides of a piston, and each piston ring, may be inspected and evaluated at positions intermediate between top dead center and bottom dead center. And, similarly, all below-piston structures including the piston carrier, piston rod and other components may be inspected and evaluated (through the cylinder's "Crank Case hand-hole").
Indeed, all cylinders may be inspected and evaluated in one revolution of the crankshaft. In this case, the engine is "barred over" (rotated manually using a lever) between each cylinder position (the engine is "never" "inched" using the starter motors).
A power assembly's Unit injector (UI) or Electronic unit injector (EUI) may be replaced or reused, as indicated by the inspection/evaluation.

Lifeboat Distribution represents over 300 software vendors worldwide, and works with over 7,000 resellers/solution providers in more than 120 countries. Lifeboat distributes software from leading publishers including Acronis, Corel, DataCore Software, Datawatch, Flexera Software (publishers of InstallShield), GFI Software, Infragistics, Intel Software, MindJet, Oracle Corporation/MySQL, Quest Software, SAP BusinessObjects, SolarWinds, Sophos, StorageCraft, TechSmith, and Veeam.
History.
Early Years.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Lifeboat Associates, a New York City Company, was one of the largest microcomputer software distributors. Lifeboat acted as an independent software broker marketing software to major hardware vendors such as Xerox, HP and Altos. As such Lifeboat Associates was instrumental in the founding of Autodesk and also financed the creation of "PC Magazine".
By mid-1981 the company had offices in England, Switzerland, France, Germany, Japan and Oakland, California. In an August 1983 article titled "Does corporate America need CP/M?," "InfoWorld" said that the company was the largest publisher of microcomputer software in the world. Lifeboat Associates successfully combined many roles, including publisher and distributor, and actively solicited authors for software products that met its standards.
The company distributed T/Maker (written by Peter Roizen), one of the first spreadsheet programs designed for the personal computer user, which went a step beyond the similar VisiCalc program by offering text-processing capability., and The Boss Financial Accounting System (written by John Burns), a $2495 package for CP/M users. It was one of the first accounting programs for micro-computers. In addition Lifeboat Associates started collecting and distributing user-written "free" software, initially for the CP/M operating system. One of the first was XMODEM, which allowed reliable communication via modem and phone line.
In June 1986, Lifeboat Associates was acquired by Voyager Software Corp. By 1988, Voyager was a three-division company; Lifeboat was the software distributor, Corsoft the corporate reseller, and Programmer's Paradise a mail-order operation.
The 1990s and 2000s.
In May 1995, Voyager Software Corp changed its name to Programmer's Paradise, Inc. and at that time, changed Lifeboat Associates' name to Lifeboat Distribution. In July 1995, Programmer's Paradise completed an initial public offering of its common stock.
On January 9, 2001, Lifeboat's European operations were sold along with all other Programmer's Paradise Eruopean operations to PC-Ware (now known as the Comparex Group).
Through the 2000s, Lifeboat expanded its vendor line card with established and emerging vendors such as InstallShield (later to become Flexera Software), Intel Software, TechSmith, GFI, and VMware.
Lifeboat developed a reputation for helping companies enter the two-tier (vendor-distributor-reseller) distribution model. For example, Lifeboat was VMware's first U.S. software distributor helping introduce that company’s nascent virtualization software to the channel.
In 2004, Lifeboat Distribution was appointed as Intel's Software Authorized Distributor in order to make that company's internally developed high performance software development tools available to customers worldwide.
Present Day.
Lifeboat specializes in sophisticated technology domains that include not only virtualization/cloud computing, but also security, application and network infrastructure, database modeling, application lifecycle management, and business productivity. For each of these technology domains, the company has created “world views” into which Lifeboat has arranged its best-of-breed vendor products. The world views are organized to support resellers’ needs for groupings of products to meet their customer technology needs.
More recently, Lifeboat added companies like Veeam Software, SolarWinds, Acronis, and StorageCraft to its line card. The company now represents an extensive set of software for the now mainstream virtualization space – products that are marketed to resellers through Lifeboat’s Virtulization World View portfolio.
In 2010, Lifeboat opened an office in Almere, Netherlands in order to better serve the company’s European resellers.
Today Lifeboat’s value-proposition revolves around software, backed-up by "extraordinary customer service" provided to reseller and vendor partners.
Lifeboat competes against much larger “broad line” distributors and must provide service differentiators to both its software vendors and its reseller customers. One way it has done this is through the deployment of innovative technologies,such as an electronic license key stocking system, EDI–based (Electronic Data Interchange) order processing, and data warehousing systems.

Pemberton Point

Pemberton Point (formerly known as Windmill Point) is a peninsula in Hull, Massachusetts. It is located at the tip of the Nantasket Peninsula.
History.
Historic manuscripts have called the location "Windmill Point" since the 1820s. The windmills for which the point were named were used by two brothers to pump seawater into vats to be used for harvesting salt. The salt would then be used to pack fish.
On July 13, 1909, fourteen-year-old Rosie Pitenhof swam across the Hull Gut from Peddocks Island to Pemberton Point and back, believed to be the first to do so.
Hull High School, the town's public high school, opened on the point in 1957.
Wind turbines.
An Enertech 40 kW wind turbine was installed on Pemberton Point and started energy production in March 1985. The turbine was funded by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources, and was sited adjacent to the high school. It was damaged beyond repair by a storm in March 1997, and was removed after a new wind turbine, nicknamed "Hull Wind 1", was installed nearby at the end of 2001.
Hull Wind 1.
Hull Wind 1, a new Vestas V47 turbine capable of producing 660 kW, began producing power on Pemberton Point in December 2001. It stands tall. It is the first commercial wind turbine on the East Coast of the United States and in the whole of New England. It is also the first commercial urban turbine in North America. During its first year of operation, it saved Hull over 100,000. In 2003, planning began for an additional wind turbine known as "Hull Wind 2". It was initially suggested that it be located near Hull Wind 1, but after concerns were expressed by nearby residents over having two in close proximity, the new Vestas V80 1.8 MW wind turbine was installed on a landfill to the east, away from Pemberton Point, and began operation in May 2006.
Facilities.
The United States Coast Guard Station Point Allerton was built in 1969 and is located near the point. It was commissioned on April 18, 1970. Point Allerton Lifesaving Station, which opened on October 15, 1889, used to hold the United States Coast Guard before the present station was built.
MBTA boats run from Pemberton Point to Long Wharf and Logan Airport.
Pemberton Point Pier is a popular fishing location.

The Bulfinch Companies

The Bulfinch Companies, Inc. is a real estate firm headquartered in Needham, Massachusetts.
History.
Bulfinch was founded in 1936 by Samuel W. Poorvu, a Lithuanian immigrant who began his career as a bricklayer and soon started a small company in Boston building and developing Post Offices. Poorvu was dubbed "The Post Office King of America" by the Wall Street Journal for his role in developing over 100 postal facilities nationwide for the United States Postal Service. Bulfinch is owned and has been continuously operated by the Schlager family. Since inception, Bulfinch has "developed, acquired, and re-positioned in excess of $1 billion in commercial real estate assets." Bulfinch owns over 3.5 million square feet of property, primarily centered in New England. Bulfinch is currently in its third-generation of management.
Awards.
Bulfinch was awarded the "Distinguished Real Estate Award" by the National Association of Industrial & Office Properties in 2007. They have also been awarded commendations by the Mayor of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The City of Cambridge, Massachusetts awarded Bulfinch the Certificate of Preservation Merit. They received LEED Gold Certifications by the USGBC. Several Bulfinch properties have earned the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star certification.

Emmanuel JM Mignot

Emmanuel JM Mignot (born 1959, in Paris) is a US sleep researcher and director of the Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine, at Stanford University. He is a leading authority on sleep research and medicine, and is mostly known for his work on narcolepsy. He is the Craig Reynolds Professor of Sleep Medicine at Stanford Medical School, Stanford University.
Biography.
Early life.
Mignot was born in Paris, France. He completed his Science Doctorate in Molecular Pharmacology at the Université Pierre and Marie Curie and went to medical school at Necker-Enfants Malades, Université René Descartes, with subspecialisation in Psychiatry. Dr. Mignot is a former student of École Normale Supérieure (Ulm).
Marriage and Offspring.
Mignot married Servane Briand (born 1964) and has two sons:
Xavier Mignot (born 1994) 
Samuel 'Jeans' Mignot (born 1996)
Expended description.
Following a postdoctoral fellowship at the Stanford Sleep Center, Mignot felt that understanding narcolepsy could lead to breakthrough in new understanding of sleep. He was appointed Assistant Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University in 1993, Professor in 2001 and Director of the Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine in 2011, succeeding William C. Dement. Trained as a pharmacologist, he first deciphered the mode of action of modafinil, amphetamines and antidepressants on narcolepsy symptoms, work that was done in close collaboration with Dr. Seiji Nishino.
Starting in 1990, he decided to isolate the gene causing narcolepsy in Doberman and Labradors. Ten years later, this led to the discovery that mutations in the hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2 cause canine narcolepsy, and that human narcolepsy was caused an immune mediated destruction of the hypocretin (orexin) producing cells in the brain Parallel work performed by Mashashi Yanagisawa, Christopher Stinton and colleagues subsequently showed that hypocretin (orexin) deficient mice also have narcolepsy.
The autoimmune destruction of hypocretin (orexin) neurons in the hypothalamus was later shown by Han and Mignot to be at least partially precipitated by influenza A infections, notably the H1N1 2009 pandemic strain, complementing findings made in Northern Europe following the H1N1 Pandemrix vaccination campaign.
Dr. Mignot identified genetic factors predisposing to human narcolepsy, such as human leukocyte antigen and other genes and isolated the gene causing the methylopathy Autosomal Dominant Cerebelar Ataxia, Deafness and Narcolepsy (ADCA-DN), DNMT1.
Awards.
Dr. Mignot has received numerous research grants and honors, including National Sleep Foundation and National Institute of Health Research Awards, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator and McKnight Neuroscience awards, the Narcolepsy Network professional service award, the Drs. C. and F. Demuth 11th Award for Young Investigators in the Neurosciences, the WC Dement Academic Achievement Award in sleep disorders medicine, the CINP and ACNP awards in neuropharmacology and the Jacobaeus prize. He is an elected member of the Association of American Physicians and of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. He is the co-author of more than 200 original scientific publications, and he serves on the editorial board of scientific journals in the field of sleep and biology research. Dr. Mignot is an active member of several professional and governmental organizations. He has been past president of the Sleep Research society, chair the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research Advisory board of the National institutes of Health and chair of the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Institute of Mental Health.

Domingo Salazar

Domingo "Darquez" Salazar was a Filipino mass murderer, who killed 16 people in the barangay of San Nicolas in Roxas, Palawan, on October 11, 1956.
Background.
Salazar, a Moro native of Zamboanga, lived with his common-law wife, Máxima Pacho, in Barangay San Nicolas. Due to his suspicions that his wife had an affair with her sister's husband, Fortunato Nares, and that the child she was pregnant with was not his own, he planned to vindicate his honour by exacting his vengeance from them.
Killings.
On the morning of October 11, 1956, the 42-year-old Salazar asked his wife to accompany him while gathering nipa for the repair of their house. Máxima's pregnant sister, Romana, arrived and invited her to accompany her to her house to get palay. Máxima refused to join her husband, which infuriated him. Salazar armed himself with a spear and a bolo knife and first killed Romana, before fatally attacking his pregnant wife and his nephew, Fortunato Nares Jr. Salazar afterwards made his way through the village and entered four houses, murdering everyone he found therein.
At the school compound, he stabbed Manuel Adion in the back with his spear; though severely wounded, Adion was able to escape. Salazar then chased two other men, Pablo Páz and Severino Adion, and threw his spear at them, hitting neither, before trying to enter the schoolhouse. The teacher present had already locked and barricaded the schoolhouse's door and windows, and Salazar was unable to force his way in. He lastly went to the local chapel and tolled the bell, calling for everybody to come. He asked to be killed, but no one dared to obey.
Eventually, two armed guards and a "barrio" officer arrived at the scene and persuaded Salazar to surrender. They did so by promising that they would shoot and kill him at the wharf, but only after he had signed a piece of paper that was to protect them from repercussions from higher authorities. When Salazar lay down his arms and was about to affix his thumbmark on the paper, he was subdued and arrested.
Aftermath.
On October 24, 1956, Salazar's physical and mental state was examined by the chief of the Puerto Princesa Hospital, who declared him normal and sane. After he had plead guilty, Salazar was sentenced to death once for each of the 16 murders, as well as multi-year prison sentences for frustrated and attempted murder. He was also fined, required to pay the heirs of his victims ₱3,000.
During his appeal hearing on June 30, 1959, the sentence was retained, but the court found his confession and admission of guilt mitigating, so his conviction for the murders of his wife Máxima and Romana Pacho, as well as of Fortunato Nares, was changed to "reclusión perpetua". The indemnity payable to his victims' relatives was raised to ₱6,000.

<doc id="36658251" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36658251" title="Axis of Resistance">
Axis of Resistance

The term axis of resistance was first employed by the Libyan daily newspaper Al-Zahf Al-Akhdar in response to American president George W. Bush's claim that Iran, Iraq and North Korea formed an "Axis of evil." In an article titled "Axis of evil or axis of resistance," the paper wrote in 2002 that "the only common denominator among Iran, Iraq and North Korea is their resistance to US hegemony." The Iranian newspaper Jomhuri-ye Eslami subsequently adopted the language in reference to the Shia insurgency in Iraq, writing in 2004 that "if the line of Iraq's Shi'is needs to be linked, united and consolidated, this unity should be realized on the axis of resistance and struggle against the occupiers."
In 2006 the Palestinian minister of the interior, Said Saim, used the term during an interview an Al-Alam television to refer to common political goals among Arabs in opposition to those of Israel or the United States. Noting the large number of Palestinian refugees in Syria, Saim stated, "Syria is also an Islamic Arab country and is also targeted by the Americans and the Zionists. Hence we see in Syria, Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas an axis of resistance in front of these pressures." The term now commonly refers to a Shiite anti-Israel and anti-Western alliance between Iran, Syria, and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. The current ruling majority of Syria is primarily made up of Alawi Muslims, who are a sect of Shi'a Islam (the majority religion of Iran). Their shared background has made them strategic allies on various issues including those of defense. The Sunni Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas has also at times been considered part of the axis due to its anti-Israeli and anti-Western views. However, as of March 2012, the group has since pulled its headquarters out of Damascus and thrown its support behind the anti-Assad Syrian opposition.
The term "axis of resistance" was used as early as August 2010, and was confirmed again August 2012 during a meeting between Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council Saeed Jalili regarding the ongoing conflict in Syria. The Syrian state-run news agency, SANA, has stated that the two governments discussed their "strategic cooperation relationship" and "attempts by some Western countries and their allies to strike at the axis of resistance by targeting Syria and supporting terrorism there."

Elysium (Pet Shop Boys album)

Elysium () is the eleventh studio album by English synthpop duo Pet Shop Boys. Released on 5 September 2012, it is the duo's final album with Parlophone. The album was produced during 2012 in Los Angeles by Andrew Dawson and Pet Shop Boys.
Background and release.
Pet Shop Boys began writing the songs for the album during a period of five weeks in Berlin, Germany in the beginning of 2011. Most of the album was written during the Progress Live concert tour with Take That from May to July 2011. In January 2012, Pet Shop Boys went to Los Angeles to work with American producer Andrew Dawson for three months. The duo were interested in working with Dawson after seeing his name in the credits for the Kanye West albums "808s & Heartbreak" (2008) and "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy" (2010). Chris Lowe has described "Elysium" as having the same feel as "Behaviour" (1990), but "sonically I think it's very different." Pet Shop Boys considered "Happy Sad" as title of the album, but came up with the title "Elysium" during a walk in Elysian Park in Los Angeles. Lyrically the album can be interpreted as "about being us at our stage in our life, doing what we do", according to Neil Tennant.
"Elysium" was released in Japan on 5 September 2012, followed by Germany and most of Europe, Australia and New Zealand on 7 September; the UK, France, South America saw the release on 10 September and the United States and Canada received it on 11 September. There are two CD formats: a single CD and a special double-CD edition which includes instrumentals of each song. A double-vinyl album was released in limited quantities which also includes the instrumental versions.
Album cover.
The artwork was designed by Mark Farrow.
Promotion.
A teaser video was released in June 2012 for the track "Invisible". The short film was made by Brian Bress and the song features backing vocals by singer-songwriter James Fauntleroy II and veteran singers Oren, Maxine and Julie Waters. The album's first official single is "Winner", which was released digitally on 3 July 2012, and subsequently in August 2012 as a four-track CD and digital EP. The "Winner" EP includes the non-album tracks "A Certain 'Je Ne Sais Quoi'", "The Way Through the Woods" and a cover version of Bee Gees' "I Started a Joke". A second digital EP of "Winner" containing remixes by Andrew Dawson, John Dahlbäck and Niki & The Dove was released a week later.
The second single, "Leaving", was released on 12 October 2012, containing the non-album tracks "Hell" and "In His Imagination", a 2003 demo titled "Baby", a remix by Dusty Kid, two remixes by Andrew Dawson, and three remixes by the duo themselves.
"Memory of the Future" was released as the album's third and final single on 31 December 2012. A seven-inch mix was commissioned by Stuart Price, as well as remixes from Price, Ulrich Schnauss, DJ Waldo Squash and Digital Dog. It also contains three non-album tracks "Listening", "One Night" and "Inside".
Critical reception.
"Elysium" has received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 67, based on 20 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews". Simon Price of "The Independent on Sunday" wrote, "If "Elysium" has a weakness, it is the absolute absence of thumping disco-pop monsters. Once you accept that, and surrender to the tranquil beauty of Chris Lowe's synth textures, you quickly realise that Neil Tennant is on top lyrical form". Robert Christgau of MSN Music quipped that although the album "may well seem too restrained", the duo are "at peace with the fate of their fame and their retirement accounts. And the understated beats suit their elysian equanimity." Kevin Ritchie of "Now" described the album as one of the duo's "most serene and sonically consistent efforts to date", adding that the song "Hold On" "exemplifies why "Elysium" is one of the year's most beautiful pop albums." Drowned in Sound's Jon Clark viewed the album as "a cohesive and strong effort that can stand up with some of duo's best", calling it "a wise and knowing homage to the life of a pop star". BBC Music's Nick Levine commented that although "Elysium" "isn't quite a top-drawer Pets album like 1988's "Introspective" or 1993's "Very"", it "could be Pet Shop Boys' warmest, wisest album yet." Owen Myers of the "NME" characterised the album as "a massive foamy middle-finger to retromania, running elegantly from jangly indie to kraut jabs". Allmusic editor David Jeffries referred to "Elysium" as "an interesting, sour, and insider-aimed dispatch from backstage, interrupted by some big moments that sound entirely commissioned."
"The Guardian" critic Jude Rogers opined that half of the album "harks back to 1990's reflective masterpiece, "Behaviour", with songs about ageing [...] and escape [...] exerting poignant pulls", but the other half "feels bitter and flippant", concluding that producer Dawson "provides a light LA gloss, but not the heavenly direction the duo deserve." In a review for "The Observer", Phil Mongredien cited "Your Early Stuff" and "Ego Music" as highlights, while noting that "elsewhere duo are on autopilot too often for this to be anything more than just another solid Pet Shop Boys album." Despite dubbing album opener "Leaving" "excellent", musicOMH's Laurence Green felt that "the rest of the album never materialises in the way you'd quite hope it would." Green continued, ""Elysium" is tainted by a slight tang of disappointment, it is a disappointment tempered in part by its recalling of "Behaviour"." "Under the Radar"s Dan Lucas complimented keyboardist Lowe's work on the album, stating, "There may be no stand-out musical line that will live long in the memory, but even more naïve melodies such as 'Winner' constantly shift and change, never growing dull." However, he criticised singer Tennant, claiming his "vocal lines often struggle to fit the songs". Douglas Wolk of Pitchfork Media wrote that "Tennant's mature gift as a lyricist is for sentimentality tempered by slyness, and he pulls that off a few times", but found that "[too much of "Elysium" [...] misplaces its subtlety." Andy Gill of "The Independent" expressed that "Elysium" is "bookended by two of the best songs the Pet Shop Boys have written in years ['Leaving' and 'Requiem in Denim and Leopardskin'], but flags badly in between", naming "Hold On" the worst song on the album.
Commercial performance.
"Elysium" debuted at number nine on the UK Albums Chart, selling 10,418 copies in its first week.

LWRC International

LWRC International, LLC formerly known as Leitner-Wise Rifle Company, Inc. and Land Warfare Resources Corporation, is a CAGE defense contractor and firearms manufacturer, founded in 1999, and based in Cambridge, Maryland. From 1999 to January 2006, the company was primarily engaged in research and development. In January 2006, the company was purchased in a management buyout by U.S. Army veteran Pat Bryan. After the reorganization the company moved into full-fledged firearms manufacturing. Along with the management buyout, LWRC absorbed Grenadier Precision Ltd. Company of Texas.
The company produces several weapons based on the M4 carbine, which use a proprietary short-stroke self-regulating gas piston system and bolt carrier design. This system prevents trapped gases from contacting the bolt carrier or receiver of the weapon, which reduces the heating and carbon fouling of the internals, simplifies field maintenance, and improves reliability.
Three segments of the Discovery Channel show "Future Weapons" were filmed featuring LWRC's weapons. Weapons featured were the M6A2, M6A4, and the Sniper/Assaulter Battle Rifle (LWRC SABR).
A segment on the Science Channel show "Factory Made" showed how the new 7.62x51mm weapon is made and tested. The LWRC International logo can be seen etched into the bolt along with the caliber size etched into the left side of the lower receiver.
F&D Defense Lawsuits & Colt Manufacturing Acquisition.
On July 16, 2013, F&D Defense LLC, a competing firearms manufacturer from New Braunfels, Texas, sued LWRC International for libel and business disparagement, asserting a liability owed by LWRC International in the amount of $17.9 million. F&D alleged that LWRC International denied and then made false public statements that F&D's owner, Corby Hall, never performed any work on their technical data. LWRC International has not made any public statement of rebuttal relating to the lawsuit with F&D Defense LLC.
On February 20, 2014, F&D Defense LLC announced its claim to ownership of Intellectual Property used by LWRC International. Also on February 20, 2014, The Firearms Blog reported that LWRC International was reportedly being purchased by Colt's Manufacturing Company for $60 million and would close the deal on March 1, 2014. 
On February 24, 2014, F&D filed a correction of inventorship lawsuit on patent no. 8,342,075 against LWRC International. F&D claimed that its owner, Corby Hall, while being contracted to perform engineering work for LWRC in 2006, independently invented core features which were then incorporated by LWRC International into its products. 
Litigation between the two companies was dropped after an apparent agreement was reached between F&D Defense and LWRC International, LLC. The following was published on the F&D website following the agreement: ""F&D Defense LLC is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement with LWRC International, Inc., in which the parties resolved the pending litigation between them. F&D regrets the statements that were made about LWRCI by a former employee. F&D agrees that LWRCI is the proper owner of U.S. Patent No. 8,342,075, entitled “Receiver for an Auto-loading Firearm”, and that the patent is valid and enforceable. The company is pleased that, as part of the agreement, LWRCI has licensed F&D to use that patent""

Marvel NOW!

Marvel NOW! is a comic book branding for the relaunch of several ongoing comic books published by Marvel Comics, that debuted in October 2012 with new #1 issues. The relaunch also included some new titles, including "Uncanny Avengers" and "All-New X-Men". Described as a shifting of the Marvel Universe following the conclusion of the "Avengers vs. X-Men" storyline, Marvel NOW! entails changes to both the publishing format and the fictional universe to attract new readers. Publishing changes include new creative teams for each of the titles and the in-universe changes include changes to character designs and new storylines. It marks the next stage of the Marvel ReEvolution initiative, which began in March 2012.
Publication history.
Marvel Comics first announced the launch of Marvel NOW! in July 2012. Marvel Editor-in-Chief Axel Alonso described it as "the next chapter in the ongoing saga of the Marvel Universe. " Alonso further explained, "From October through February, we’ll provide at least one great reason for readers—old, lapsed or new—to go into a comic store each week: a new issue #1, featuring an exciting new creative team and driving concept, that’s an easy entry-point into the Marvel Universe." Marvel Chief Creative Officer Joe Quesada stressed that it is not a reboot but a shifting of the Marvel Universe following the events of "Avengers vs. X-Men". Quesada explained that there will be "a lot of changes to the character status quos, alter egos, costumes, creator shifts, design shifts, the way that we do our covers, digital shifts and the way we start delivering our books".
In March 2013, Alonso announced that Marvel would be launching a new wave of Marvel NOW! titles, dubbed "Wave Two", in the summer of that year. Alonso stated, "There are plans for a Marvel NOW! Wave 2—a new wave of titles that will generate the same amount of excitement amongst retailers and fans that the first wave did. From 'Uncanny Avengers' to 'Thanos Rising,' Marvel NOW! has been a hit, and we're far from done. Look for exciting new series, starting in July and carrying through next year". It was announced a week later that "Avengers A.I." would be the first of these new titles.
In September 2013, Marvel announced a next phase of Marvel NOW! in the aftermath of the "Infinity" storyline, (which led into the "Inhumanity" storyline) called "All-New Marvel NOW!" which will see new series being launched and will also provide entry issue to existing series. These entry issues will be branded as .NOW issues. For example, "Avengers" #24 was billed as "Avengers" #24.NOW. Several new series, such as "Inhuman" and "All-New Invaders" were also announced.
In January 2014, Marvel announced that following the conclusion of the Ultimate Marvel miniseries "Cataclysm" in April 2014, and coinciding with the Marvel Universe All-New Marvel NOW! launch, three new Ultimate series will debut from April 2014, under the banner Ultimate Marvel NOW!. The three series are: "", "Ultimate FF", and "All-New Ultimates".

<doc id="36658496" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36658496" title="Troy Book">
Troy Book

Troy Book is a Middle English poem by John Lydgate relating the history of Troy from its foundation through to the end of the Trojan war. It is in five books, comprising 30,117 lines in ten-syllable couplets. The poem's major source is Guido delle Colonne's "Historia destructionis Troiae".
Background.
"Troy Book" was Lydgate's first full-scale work. It was commissioned from Lydgate by the Prince of Wales (later Henry V), who wanted a poem that would show the English language to be as fit for a grand theme as the other major literary languages,Ywriten as wel in oure langageAs in Latyn and in Frensche it is.Lydgate tells us that he began writing the poem at four o'clock in the afternoon of Monday, 31 October 1412; he completed it in 1420.
It has been argued that Lydgate intended "Troy Book" as an attempt to outdo Chaucer's Trojan romance "Troilus and Criseyde", and certainly the frequent recurrence of tributes to Chaucer's excellence as a poet is a notable feature of the poem. The poem emphasizes the disastrous results of political discord and militarism, and also presents the conventional medieval themes of the power of Fortune to influence earthly affairs and the vanity of worldly things.
Publication.
"Troy Book" survives in 23 manuscripts, testifying to the popularity of the poem during the 15th century. It was printed first by Richard Pynson in 1513, and second by Thomas Marshe in 1555. A modernized version sometimes attributed to Thomas Heywood, called "The Life and Death of Hector", appeared in 1614. "Troy Book" exercised an influence on Robert Henryson, Thomas Kyd, and Christopher Marlowe, and was one of Shakespeare's sources for "Troilus and Cressida".
Criticism.
Modern critics have generally made moderate claims for "Troy Book"’s literary merit. Antony Gibbs judged the poem to be of uneven quality, adding that "its couplet form indulges Lydgate's fatal garrulity." Douglas Gray found some good writing to praise, and particularly singled out the eloquence and pathos of some of Lydgate's rhetorical laments, descriptions, and speeches.
Reference edition.
The reference edition of "Troy Book" is that by Henry Bergen, published as volumes 97, 103, 106 and 126 of the Early English Text Society Extra Series between 1906 and 1935.

Let's Ask America

"Let's Ask America" is an American quiz show hosted by former "Attack of the Show!" co-host Kevin Pereira. Debuting September 17, 2012, the program features contestants who play from their homes via webcams, answering trivia questions relating to current events. A second season debuted September 9, 2013. On November 4, 2013, it was announced that Scripps is launching "Let's Ask America" nationwide through a distribution deal with MGM Television.
Produced by paraMedia and Telepictures, the program was created for the E. W. Scripps Company, and initially premiered on seven of its television stations alongside another Scripps-created program, the news magazine program "The List". The premiere of the two programs are part of a strategy being undertaken by Scripps to replace existing syndicated programming in the valuable pre-primetime hour with new "home-grown" programs. These new programs would allow Scripps complete control over advertising inventories during the hour for better profitability, unlike "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!", which Scripps staff felt were too expensive and underperforming in comparison. "Wheel" and "Jeopardy!" were replaced by "The List" and "Let's Ask America" on the Scripps stations that carried them. Warner Bros. Television Distribution began to syndicate "Let's Ask America" to other markets at beginning of the 2013 season.
The contestants participate by Skype from the comfort of their own home, an inexpensive technology negating the need for travel expenses. One participated from his bathroom, another from her beer room, and one from a closet. In sweeps months, the show features 'celebrity' editions featuring local news talent from the stations carrying the series such as meteorologists and anchors playing the game from their station's studios for local charities.
The program is executive produced by Jeff Apploff, Jack Martin and Todd Stevens and is co-produced by Ben Betts and Casey Green. 
Main Game.
Round 1.
In Round 1, there are four contestants, and each of them will attempt to answer the three multiple-choice questions. In this round, questions will have two possible answers. The host will first read the two answers and then follow with the question to be answered. Then, all four contestants will have approximately 30 seconds to write down their answers on to the card stock included in their game kits. Once all contestants have verbally acknowledged that they have written down their answers, the host will ask them each to reveal their answers in a sequence determined by the producers. Then the host will reveal the correct answer. Each contestant that answered the question correctly will be awarded the prize money assigned for that question. Contestants who answered incorrectly will receive no prize money. After the correct answer to the first question has been revealed, all four contestants will receive the next question. The host will reveal the correct answer to the next questions, and any money earned will be assigned to the proper contestants. The contestant with the lowest amount of money at the end of the round (or the loser of the tiebreaker challenge, if applicable) will be eliminated and will not receive any prize money earned before elimination. The three contestants with the highest amount of money at the end of the round will advance to Round 2.
Round 2.
Round 2 is the same, with three possible answers. Again, the player with the lowest amount of money is eliminated empty-handed.
Round 3.
Round 3 is the same, but now there are four possible answers to choose from. The higher-scoring player wins the game.
Tie-breaker (Dash for Ca$h).
If there's a tie at the end of each round (for second, third or fourth in the first two rounds; for first in the last) the tied players will play a special game called "Dash for Ca$h". The tied players will do a scavenger hunt race. The host will tell the players the item they must find and the criteria they must meet. For Season 1, the players must do a certain activity with the item. For Season 2, doing certain activities with the item in question is still involved, but in some episodes the item must be the correct answer to a survey question, and in others the item must simply be obtained. When the host says "GO", they start the race. The last-place player will be eliminated and the highest scoring player(s) advances.
Bonus Round.
Season 1.
Before the break the player will write his/her wager, then will face another 4-option question. He/she has to answer it in 30 seconds. Giving the correct answer will add the money equal to his/her wager, but an incorrect answer loses the wager. However, if a player wagers all of their money and answers correctly, his/her wager pays 5:1; if he/she is wrong while wagers everything, he/she is still guaranteed $1,000, unless he/she has less than that heading into the final round (in which case they get a consolation prize).
Season 2.

His design of St Gabriel, Blackburn, is considered to be "one of the milestones in the development of English church architecture towards Modern Movement style".
Although Pollard and Pevsner state that he "worked exclusively for the Roman Catholic Church", he did design one Anglican church, St Gabriel, Blackburn. Five of his churches have been designated by English Heritage as listed buildings. The Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes in Blackpool, and English Martyrs' Church, Wallasey are listed at Grade II*, and listed at Grade II are St Monica's Church, Bootle, St Teresa's Church, Upholland, and Holy Cross Church, Bidston.

The issue is extremely notable in Indian comic book genre for introducing the comic book superhero - Super Commando Dhruva.

Plot summary.
Two muggers try to rob an old man at "Rajnagar" dock which is witnessed by a bird. The bird flies back to a guy wearing yellow and blue costume and reports him about the occurrence of the crime. Soon the two muggers hear the sound of a bike engine. They recognise this sound and know the guy to whom this bike belongs. They try to run away but the young guy catches them and beats them up. The old man thanks him and asks how he came to know that he was being robbed in this secluded place. To his amazement the young guy replies that "a bird told him".
This young saviour of the old man is revealed to be a teen aged crime fighter and the captain of the "Special Commando Force" - Super Commando Dhruva. After this little incident, the origin story of Dhruva is revealed in a flashback sequence.
In flashback, "Jupiter Circus" is a popular circus located on the outskirts of Rajnagar. It has a team of world class performers, acrobats and artists which includes "Shyam" and "Radha", the trapeze artists. They fall in love and get married. Within a few months, Radha gives birth to their first kid, a baby boy. Shyam names him "Dhruva". Growin up among circus's pet animals and a barrage of world class performers, Dhruva not only learns their arts to perfection but also learns to communicate with animals and birds. At the age of 14yrs, he starts performing in Jupiter Circus.
Buoyed by Dhruva's stunning performances, Jupiter Circus scales new heights of success becoming an eye sore for the rival "Globe Circus's" owner, "Boss", in the process. He hatches a conspiracy against Jupiter Circus and sends his strongman "Jubisko" and a sharpshooter "Bond" to destroy Jupiter Circus. In the middle of the night, when everyone was fast asleep, Jubisko pours petrol all over Jupiter Circus and lights it setting the whole circus in flame. Shyam catches him in the act and tries to stop him, but Jubisko kills him in front of Dhruva's eyes and runs away in a car. Dhruva tries to chase them on his bike but Bond shoots his bike's tyre and Dhruva gives up the chase.
Dhruva returns to Jupiter circus only to find out every living creature, humans and animals, charred to death. Enraged, Dhruva vows revenge and reaches Globe circus. In a series of events, all the three perpetrators die their own deaths. Later, Rajnagar's Senior Superintendent of Police "Rajan Mehra" informs Dhruva that Jacob, Jupiter Circus's owner, had nominated him as the beneficiary in the insurance policy that he had bought for the circus and as a result, Dhruva has inherited Rs. 50 lakh from the claim. Dhruva tells him that he has vowed to eliminate evil from this world and would use this money for this task. Impressed with his courage, Rajan Mehra, who has a small family consisting of his wife "Rajni" and a little daughter "Shweta", decides to adopt Dhruva.

Uncanny Avengers

Uncanny Avengers is an ongoing comic book series published by Marvel Comics that debuted in October 2012, with the launch of Marvel NOW!. The series centers on a superhero team of Avengers composed of classic members of both the Avengers and X-Men, that came together following events of the "Avengers vs. X-Men" storyline. Within the Marvel Universe itself, the team is officially named the Avengers Unity Squad.
Publication history.
Marvel Comics announced "Uncanny Avengers" by the creative team of Rick Remender and John Cassaday in August 2012. Uncanny Avengers is a new team of Avengers that features a line-up of both classic Avengers and X-Men including Captain America, Havok, Rogue, the Scarlet Witch, Thor and Wolverine. The team is a response to the events of "Avengers vs. X-Men". Remender said, "There’s something that Cyclops said to (Captain America) on Utopia that’s ringing in his head. He didn’t do enough to help. And Steve (Captain America) is taking that to heart. Coming out of AvX with the landscape shifted and changed as much as it is, there are events that lead Steve to recognizing that he needs to do more". IN March 2014, Marvel released Issue #18.Now, which was the first issue of 'Uncanny Avengers', to have the All- New Marvel Now icon on the cover.
Fictional team history.
The Red Shadow.
Wolverine gives a eulogy at the funeral of Professor X, which is held at the Jean Grey School, while Havok visits Cyclops in prison to discuss Cyclops' actions as the Phoenix. Afterwards, Captain America and Thor meet with Havok, where Captain America offers him the chance to lead a new Avengers squad. They are attacked by a lobotomized Avalanche and unite to defeat him while saving as many civilians as possible. While paying her respects to Professor X at his grave, Scarlet Witch is confronted by Rogue about her role in everything that has happened to the X-Men and the mutant race. While arguing, they are attacked by Red Skull's S-Men, who defeat them both and steal Professor X's body. In his lair, the Red Skull is seen removing Professor X's brain as part of his plan to gain the power to "eradicate the mutant menace".
While looking for survivors after Avalanche's attack, Wolverine questions Captain America's choice of having Havok lead the team and Thor vows to resolve the mutant conflict. Meanwhile, through a televised appearance of "Honest John, the Living Propaganda", Red Skull is able to make certain people kill their mutated friends. In addition to this, Rogue is seen escaping after being captured by the S-Men and Scarlet Witch is tempted by Red Skull to repeat the events of "House of M". Rogue attacks the Scarlet Witch and they fight until they both discover the lobotomized body of Professor X. Red Skull arrives and reveals that he has fused his brain with Professor X's brain. Red Skull also reveals that he is a clone of the original Red Skull that was created in 1942 and held in cryogenic stasis in the event that Germany lost World War II.
Using Professor X's telepathy, Red Skull provokes ordinary citizens of New York into joining the S-Men in a mass assault against even potential mutants even managing to take control of Thor after Red Skull had Honest John take the form of Odin to manipulate him. When fighting Wolverine, Red Skull has Goat-Faced Girl negate Wolverine's healing factor so that Thor can land a cataclysmic blow on Wolverine. However, Red Skull is unable to completely control Captain America, and an attack against him disrupts his powers long enough for Rogue and Scarlet Witch to break free.
As the Scarlet Witch fights the mind-controlled Thor, Red Skull once again tries to tempt Captain America into joining his anti-mutant crusade. With some help from Havok, Scarlet Witch removes Thor from the battle allowing Havok and Rogue to aid Captain America against the Red Skull overpowering him until Dancing Water saves him. With the people around them free, Havok tells them that the attacks on the mutants wasn't their fault. Back at the Avengers Mansion (the base for the newly coined Avengers Unity Squad), Captain America and Havok look at leads to find the S-Men and Havok expresses doubts over his own leadership. The Scarlet Witch attempts to start again with Rogue, who refuses, stating that she is joining the team to honour Xavier and keep an eye on Wanda. Thor tells Wolverine that he hasn't failed Professor X's dream.
The team makes their debut as the Avengers Unity Squad (which also contains Sunfire, Wasp, and Wonder Man as the team's latest recruits) during a press conference that debuts them. The press conference is then crashed by a resurrected Grim Reaper who attacks the Avengers Unity Squad while claiming that he is now unable to die. During the fight, Rogue absorbs some of Wonder Man's powers and seemingly punches Grim Reaper harder than normal which apparently kills Grim Reaper.
Apocalypse Twins.
In 1013 AD at a Scandinavian inn, Thor is in a bar fight when he is attacked by Apocalypse, who acts to safeguard the future due to information given him by Rama-Tut. Thor finds that Apocalypse is wearing Celestial-built armor that can withstand the powers of a god. Thor returns to Asgard and demands an audience with his father Odin, but when Odin asks him to take the high road, Thor turns to Loki for help. Loki leads him to a hidden scroll in Odin's library which could bless a weapon to pierce Celestial armor, only for "Loki" to later be revealed as Kang the Conqueror. Thor returns to London and slays the 11th Century's version of the Horsemen of Apocalypse. He then breaks into Apocalypse's craft and manages to cut his armor open with his axe "Jarnbjorn", but Apocalypse escapes. In the present day, Kang the Conqueror appears at the final resting place of Baron Mordo in Brazil. Kang then takes the axe Jarnbjorn and appears to have a plan for the weapon.
Havok clears Rogue's name with S.H.I.E.L.D for killing Grim Reaper having her start an investigation into Magneto. While Wasp shows Havok her clothing line to promote mutants, a Celestial ship controlled by the Apocalypse Twins crashes into S.W.O.R.D.'s Peak base with Captain America and Sunfire aboard. Sunfire lets Captain America escape while Thor flies towards the wreckage.
Age of Ultron.
Issue #8AU featured a one issue tie in with the series 'Age of Ultron'. In an alternate reality, the Earth is near the end, due to Ultron taking over the world. Wolverine tried to fix the world by using time travel to go kill Hank Pym before he invented the being known as Ultron. By doing so, the world was altered. This issue features the Apocalypse twins trying to kill Colonel America (an alternate form of Captain America) while under orders of Kang the Conquerer. While Colonel America goes into the sewers to meet Havok, he is attacked by the twins. Colonel America manages to escape injured, but results in the deaths of the alternate versions of Havok and Rogue. After the twins failed their task, Kang plans to send the twins back to the mutant camps for the next few years.
Ragnarok Now.
A story-line in which the remaining members of the Avengers must work together to stop the Apocalypse Twins, after the team splits up.
Avenge the Earth.
A story line in which all the world's mutants are teleported, and are living on Planet X following the destruction of Earth after the arrival of the Celestials. While most of the mutant population has accepted the new status quo, the remaining Avengers (Havok, Wolverine, Wasp, and Sunfire, aided by Beast) must work with Kang and his Chrono-Corp to defeat Eimen, intending to project their minds back into their past selves and stop the Celestials before they can strike.
Reception.
Havok's speech in #5 in which he rejected his mutant identity because it represented everything he hates, and Remender's response to detractors to "drown yourself hobo piss," caused some controversy.

New Watch (novel)

New Watch ("Novyi Dozor", Новый дозор) is a fantasy novel by Russian writer Sergei Lukyanenko.
The novel is the last in a pentalogy that includes "Night Watch", "Day Watch" ("Dnevnoy Dozor", Дневной дозор), "Twilight Watch" ("Sumerechny Dozor", Сумеречный дозор), and "Final Watch" ("Posledniy Dozor", Последний дозор). The series revolves around two opposing supernatural groups (known as "Others"): the Night Watch, an organization dedicated to policing the actions of the Dark Others—and the Day Watch, which polices the actions of the Light Others.
New Watch was sent to the publishing house in January 2012, with release to the Russian market Summer 2012.
"New Watch" was published in English on May 2, 2013 (ISBN 0434022314 Publisher: William Heinemann, 2013), in UK Only. Scheduled release for the US is April 2014 and can be pre-ordered on Amazon.com.
Structure and style.
New Watch has the typical structure of the Watch novels, excluding Day Watch. New Watch is divided into three stories - Vague objectives, Troublous times and Vague deeds. Each story begins with a prologue followed by eight numbered chapters and, changing the usual structure, without an epilogue. Except for the prologues, the events of each story are written in a first person narrative using the voice of the Higher Magician character Anton Gorodetsky, a member of the Night Watch. Events in each of the prologues are written in a third person narrative. The entire novel is written in the past tense.
Plot Summary.
Vague objectives.
Anton Gorodetsky, while seeing a foreign colleague off at the airport, encounters an overweight 10-year-old boy named Kesha, who tries to prevent his mother from boarding a plane, claiming that the plane will crash. Anton scans the boy and determines that Kesha is an uninitiated high-level Other, possibly a prophet. Anton influences Kesha's mother not to board the plane. Meanwhile, Sergeant Pastukhov of the Moscow police, who gained an ability to see Others (he calls Light Others "dogs" and Dark Others "wolves") in the first novel, sees an extremely powerful entity whom he labels a Tiger. The Tiger can remove a human's aura, which leaves the person completely indifferent to anything. The Night Watch sends Semyon to initiate the boy, although Geser is very disturbed by the events at the airport, as the plane does not crash as prophesized (unlike predictions, prophecies cannot be changed). Geser calls a meeting of all Light Great Others (including Anton's wife Svetlana and daughter Nadya). They then travel by car (through Twilight) to Kesha's apartment in order to protect him from this strange new creature. The Tiger intercepts them and proves to be more than a match for four Great Mages. It only leaves when Zabulon joins the battle. Anton realizes that the Tiger is a creature of the Twilight whose purpose is to hunt prophets before they utter their first complete prophecy. If this prophecy is heard by a human, then it becomes inevitable. If an Other hears it, then he or she becomes the Tiger's next target. While the Night Watch is attempting to hold off the Tiger, Kesha utters the prophecy in an empty room (a prophet does not hear his or her own key prophecy), causing the Tiger to leave. However, Anton has previously asked Kesha to press the record button on a toy phone. Anton then removes the phone's flash drive.
Troublous times.
Geser summons Anton and sends him on a business trip to London to meet Erasmus Darwin, a Dark Other who is a prophet and the grandfather of Charles Darwin. Erasmus was able to trick the Tiger. Erasmus meets Anton and explains how, while his teacher (Zabulon himself) was desperately fighting the Tiger, the young Erasmus shouted the prophecy into an oak. Erasmus then gives Anton a goblet he made from that oak and claims that his prophecy can be revealed, although he refuses to tell Anton how. At a local pub, Anton meets the former witch Arina, who tells Anton that, a hundred years ago, she prevented a prophecy that would destroy Russia from happening (although it resulted in the Russian Revolution). She convinces Anton to go with her to Taiwan to meet Fang Wan-Yang, whose friend was a prophet. Fang reveals that the Tiger can leave the Others alone if they can prove beyond doubt that they will never reveal the prophecy (Fang had to kill his friend and honors his memory by keeping the secret). Arina, who has figured out that Anton has a recording of Kesha's prophecy, steals the flash drive and flees using an untraceable artifact.
Vague deeds.
Arina once again appears to Anton and explains that the boy's prophecy concerns his daughter and urges Anton to listen to it. Anton gets a call from Erasmus, who reveals that he has made a second goblet and listened to it. Anton hears as the Tiger kills Erasmus. Anton, who has backed up the recording of Kesha's prophecy on his old mini-disc player, listens to it and hears that Nadya, an Absolute Other, is capable of destroying the Tiger and, with it, the Twilight itself. Anton decides to destroy Erasmus's oak goblet. At that moment, Nadya, Kesha, and Arina enter the apartment. Instead of destroying the goblet, fire reveals Erasmus's prophecy to the four. The prophecy claims that Nadya will destroy the Tiger and the Twilight. Seeing the Tiger, who is determined to kill them all to prevent the prophecy from coming true, Anton uses Arina's teleportation artifact to flee to her cabin. Arina, who has decided that magic is evil and must be destroyed, tries to provoke Nadya to kill the Tiger. Anton walks outside and talks to the Tiger. The Tiger explains that a prophecy is merely the manifestation of the will of humanity, but not all of them must happen. If the Tiger dies, then the Others will lose their magic. Anton returns and makes Kesha and Nadya promise never to reveal the prophecy. He then traps himself and Arina in a Sarcophagus of Time for all eternity. However, the Tiger pulls Anton out, fearing that Nadya might kill it to try to get her father back. Arina remains in the Sarcophagus with the depleted teleportation artifact (which Anton believes can be recharged in 5 years). Satisfied, the Tiger leaves.

Chum Taylor

Edwin Vernon "Chum" Taylor (born 4 April 1927) is a retired Australian motorcycle speedway rider who won the Australian Individual Speedway Championship in 1966.
Biography.
Born in Perth, Western Australia, Taylor received the nickname 'Chum' after his grandmother's comment of "oh, my little chum!" on first seeing him when he was a day old. He competed as an amateur jockey and worked as a cooper at the Swan brewery near his home, which allowed him to buy his first motorcycle. After trying road racing and scrambling, Taylor began his speedway career at the Claremont Speedway in 1948. Early success led to an offer to ride for the Ashfield Giants in the United Kingdom, going on to ride for CardiffDragons for two seasons. He raced in Britain for several teams from 1951 to 1966 including Ashfield Giants (1951), Cardiff Dragons (1951-2), Bristol Bulldogs (1953), Southampton Saints (1958-1961), Oxford Cheetahs (1963), Poole Pirates (1964) and Cradley Heath Heathens in 1966.
He represented Australia in the World Final in 1960, finishing in 11th place. He won the Western Australia Championship on a record five occasions (1958, 1962, 1963, 1968, and 1970), all at Claremont, and won the Australian Solo Championship in January 1966 at the Rowley Park Speedway in Adelaide.
Taylor represented Australia (and Australasia) several times at international level, first in 1958 in the second Test against England and again in 1959, 1960, 1967/68, 1969/70, 1970/71 (a series in which he captained the team), 1971/72, 1972/3, and for a final time in 1973, a series in which his son Glyn also rode. Glyn Taylor would go on to emulate his father by winning the WA State title in 1982 and 1983.
He retired from racing in 1973 at the age of 46 after a crash in a second half race at Crewe in which he broke his shoulder blade. The Chum Taylor Cup is contested annually in his honour at the Pinjar Park Speedway north of Perth.
Chum Taylor's autobiography, "A Dangerous Life", was published in 1986.
In November 2013 he was inducted into the Motorcycling Western Australia Hall of Fame.

Agelas schmidti

Agelas schmidti, the brown tubular sponge, is a species of demosponge. It occurs at moderate depths in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea and often has a colonial coral growing over the surface. The type locality is Puerto Rico.
Description.
The brown tubular sponge is a large sponge forming mounds that may be a metre (yard) across. The base is encrusted on the substrate or may develop lobes but above this there are several dozen large vertical tubes, narrowing at the top, each with a hollow centre or atrium and a large hole or osculum at the apex. They are up to long and wide and are soft, elastic and resilient. The walls are strengthened by a skeleton of spongin fibres and tiny calcareous spicules. On the side of these tubes there are deep grooves and shallow cup shaped depressions up to across each occupied by a dark reddish brown zoanthid ("Parazoanthus sp."). This is a colonial coral living symbiotically with the sponge and the polyps are connected together by tissue called coenchyme inside the atrium of the sponge. The general colour of the sponge is brownish orange or brick red.
Distribution and habitat.
The brown tubular sponge is found in the Caribbean Sea, the Greater Antilles, Puerto Rico, the northern coast of Brazil and the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico. It typically occurs on reefs at depths between in positions where there is a strong current and the water is clear.
Biology.
The brown tubular sponge is a filter feeder. The current flowing over the top of the sponge draws in water through small pores near the base called ostia. These are lined by flagellated cells called choanocytes. The food particles are engulfed by these and the water exits through the osculi. Only very small particles can enter the sponge and 80% of its nourishment comes from bacteria sized particles.
The brown tubular sponge produces a secondary metabolite, sceptrina, an alkaloid with antimicrobial properties.

Ameerat

Ameerat (foaled 4 April 1998) is a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. In a racing career which lasted from August 2000 to October 2001 she ran seven times and won two races. After winning once from three starts as a two-year-old, she won the Classic 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse on her first appearance of the 2001 season. Her subsequent career was disappointing, as she finished unplaced in her three remaining races. At the end of her three-year-old season she was retired from racing to become a broodmare. Ameerat was not regarded as one of the better classic winners.
Background.
Ameerat, a bay horse with a white star and three white socks, was bred in England by her owner Ahmed Al Maktoum. Ameerat was sired by Mark of Esteem an “outstanding” miler who won the 2000 Guineas and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 1996. He went on to become a successful stallion, siring the Epsom Derby winner Sir Percy and the European champion sprinter Reverence. Her dam, Walimu, won three minor races for Ahmed Al Maktoum and was a granddaughter of the racemare Roussalka who won the Coronation Stakes and two editions of the Nassau Stakes in the mid-1970s. As a descendant of the broodmare Mumtaz Begum, she is a member of the same branch of Thoroughbred family 9-c which produced Shergar, Risen Star and Oh So Sharp.
Ameerat was trained at Newmarket, Suffolk by Michael Jarvis and was ridden in all but one of her races by Philip Robinson.
Racing career.
Ameerat began her racing career in a seven furlong maiden race at Goodwood in August 2000. According to the Daily Telegraph she had already acquired a "glowing reputation" on the basis of her performances in training. She started 3/1 favourite and won comfortably by two lengths from Sayedah, leading the Racing Post to describe her as "promising". A month later, Ameerat was moved up in class for the Group Three May Hill Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse. Ridden by Frankie Dettori, Ameerat had a troubled race, struggling to obtain a clear run in the straight and then being hampered in the last strides as she finished second by a length to the favourite Karasta. In October, Ameerat started 4/1 second favourite for the Group Two Rockfel Stakes at Newmarket, but finished sixth of the sixteen runners behind Sayedah and Imagine.
Ameerat did not contest any of the early trial races in the spring of 2001, but reportedly pleased Jarvis with her performances in training. On 6 May, Ameerat made her three-year-old debut in the 1000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile course. She started at odds of 11/1 in a field of fifteen runners, with Karasta being made the 9/2 favourite. Robinson positioned the filly just behind the front-running Godolphin filly Muwakleh before moving up to challenge for the lead a furlong from the finish. In the closing stages, Ameerat overtook Muwakleh and won by a neck, with Toroca one and three quarter lengths further back in third. Ameerat's victory gave Jarvis his first British classic winner in a thirty-three year training career. He described the moment as "a great thrill", while Robinson described the winner as a "remarkable filly".
Ameerat's form deteriorated after her classic win. Her next start came in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot where she made little impression, finishing fifth behind the French-trained filly Banks Hill. Matched against colts and older horses in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood in July, Ameerat started a 16/1 outsider and finished eighth of the ten runners behind Noverre. The filly was dropped in class for her final start in the Group Two Sun Chariot Stakes at Newmarket in October. Ameerat was never in serious contention and finished seventh behind Independence.
Ameerat remained in training in 2002, and was entered in the Eclipse Stakes, but did not race again.
Stud record.
Ameerat became a broodmare for the Maktoum family's Darley Stud. She has produced several minor winners, but nothing of top class.

Medical surveillance

The mission of a medical surveillance program is to keep workers healthy and ensure that employers are meeting OSHA standards in health and safety. Medical surveillance has an emphasis on prevention: it is designed to detect potential workplace hazards before irreversible health effects can occur. Clinicians with expertise in occupational health, industrial exposures, and respiratory protection screen workers with physical examinations, blood testing, spirometry (a measurement lung function), and audiometry. Screenings are performed at set intervals, often annually. 
The clinicians providing medical surveillance services include board-certified occupational and environmental medicine physicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, and NIOSH-certified spirometry technicians.

Martin-Baker Mk.2

The Martin-Baker Mk.2 is a British ejection seat designed and built by Martin-Baker. Introduced in the early 1950s, the Mk.2 was developed from the Martin-Baker Mk.1, the main improvement being automatic parachute deployment.
History.
The Mk.2 seat was designed as an improved version of the first Martin-Baker seat. Improvements included relocation of the main parachute and dinghy, automatic parachute deployment and man/seat separation systems to assist incapacitated crews . During 1953 Mk.1 seats in service were modified to Mk.2 standard. The first successful ejection using a Mk.2 seat took place on 15 May 1953, the aircraft involved being a Supermarine Attacker operating from HMS "Eagle".
Operation sequence.
Operating the face blind firing handle initiates firing of the main gun located at the rear of the seat, the main gun is a telescopic tube with two explosive charges that fire in sequence. As the seat moves up its guide rails an emergency oxygen supply is activated and personal equipment tubing and communication leads are automatically disconnected.
A steel rod, known as the drogue gun, is fired and extracts two small drogue parachutes to stabilise the seat's descent path. A barostatic mechanism prevents the main parachute from opening above an altitude of 10,000 ft (3,000 m) A time delay mechanism operates the main parachute below this altitude, the seat then separates from the occupant for a normal parachute descent, a manual separation handle and ripcord is provided should the automatic system fail.
Applications.
The Mk.2 ejection seat has been installed in the following aircraft types:

Socket.IO

Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and server. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for node.js. Both components have a nearly identical API. Like node.js, it is event-driven.
Socket.IO primarily uses the WebSocket protocol, but if needed can fallback on multiple other methods, such as Adobe Flash sockets, JSONP polling, and AJAX long polling, while providing the same interface. Although it can be used as simply a wrapper for WebSocket, it provides many more features, including broadcasting to multiple sockets, storing data associated with each client, and asynchronous I/O.
It can be installed with the npm (node packaged modules) tool.

Jesús Reyes Ferreira

Jesús Reyes Ferreira, born José de Jesús Benjamín Buenaventura de los Reyes y Ferreira and also known as Chucho Reyes, was a self-taught artist and antiques/art collector and vendor. Reyes Ferreira began painting on crêpe paper, a delicate material not meant to last, as a way of decorating paper meant to wrap sales from his antiques/art store. The decorated paper became popular enough to be sold on its own. Although he began this activity in Guadalajara, he did not produce the bulk of his work until after he moved to Mexico City when he was 58 years old. Here he continued collecting and selling objects such as colonial art and Mexican handcrafts and folk art, being one of the early exponents for the appreciation of these objects. He also spent several hours a day painting. His work was first exhibited in 1950 with his first individual exhibition in 1967 at the Palacio de Bellas Artes after a half century of painting. As a self-taught painter, his works are relatively simple and often are dismissed as folk painting but they were and his aesthetics were praised by famous artists and architects at the time.
Life.
Reyes Ferreira was born on October 17, 1880 in Guadalajara to Buenaventura Reyes y Zavala and Felipa Ferreira Flores. His childhood home was on Morelos Street in Guadalajara, a typical house for the area, with a central courtyard, rooms connected by halls lined with railings and flowerpots. Today the structure is the Museo de los Títeres or Marionette Museum. His family was cultured and his father was eccentric and very strict. He was initially homeschooled by his father, but completed primary school at the Liceo de Varones, where he took art classes.
After primary school he worked at a number of jobs. While working at a chocolate factory, he noticed the interesting patterns that the grease made on the wrapping paper. He had his first contact with art in 1894, becoming an apprentice at the Loreto y Ancira lithography and print shop. He then worked an art supply store called Casa Pellandina in Guadalajara. He started as general help but then moved onto creating displays and decorating the store’s windows. From there he began to become known for the decoration of event spaces such as rental halls and churches for events such as weddings and baptisms for wealthy families. Interested in handcrafts and folk art, he frequently visited the El Rincon del Diablo fireworks workshop to watch them paint the Judas figures and fireworks frames. He also worked in silver shops learning how to cast the metal. He designed a number of pieces, some of which remain in the family.
He met Amelia Rivas while working at the art store. He began to court her but she died shortly thereafter of tuberculosis .
His father died in 1911, leaving him the house and a collection of art, handcrafts and antiques, prompting interest in these areas. The house became something a haven for artists and other bohemian types as he used part of it to sell antiques and art. Another section became something of a museum. He became well known not only to Guadalajara artists but also a number of artists from Mexico City. Reyes was considered eccentric. When Reyes Ferreira bought a book, he always bought two copies, one to cut up to create a new design and the other to keep intact. He began drawing and painting on the crepe paper used to wrap purchases from his store, these drawings became popular and soon clients were buying the paper for its own sake.
In 1938, he was denounced for unusual “sexual preferences.” He was arrested along with a number of youths from upper society. He was beaten by police and forced to wear a sign saying that he was a corrupter of youth. The incident forced Reyes Ferreira to sell his childhood home and move to Mexico City.
He was helped in his move by artist friends from the capital including André Breton and Frida Kahlo . He moved into an old colonial house on Milan Street in Colonia Juárez, where he lived with his two sisters, Antonia and Maria. He decorated it unusually, with lighted cubes, various colors and niches for religious objects. The courtyard was used as a studio for painting and he continued to sell antiques and art. He also continued to have his house open to writers, intellectuals and artists such as Carlos Pellicer, Salvador Novo, Juan Soriano, Raúl Anguiano, Jorge Enciso, Diego Rivera as well as architects such as Luis Barragán and Matias Goeritz .
When he was 87 years old he traveled for the first time outside Mexico, heading to Paris, Rome, Madrid. A year later he went to the Middle East. He also visited New York.
He died on August 6, 1977 in Mexico City.
Career.
Reyes Ferreira is principally known for being a painter and an collector/vender of antiques and art. 
Despite his early interest in art, he had no intention of becoming an artist. As an antiques vender in Guadalajara, he began painting the crepe paper used for wrapping sales just as a way to decorate it. Sales of his paintings began when customers came to the store to buy the painted paper. Despite the sales of the paper in Guadalajara, he produced 85% of his artwork after he moved to Mexico City when he was 58 years old. He spent several hours a day painting on crepe paper and cardboard in courtyard of his house.
His work was exhibited in New York in 1942, London in 1945 and at the Galería Arquitac en Guadalajara. In 1961 he participated in the Exposición de los Hartos, an international art event at the Galería Antonio Souza. However, he did not have his first individual exhibition until 1967, at the Palacio de Bellas Artes after a half century of painting. This was followed by exhibitions at the Casa de la Cultura Jalisciense in 1968, the Galería Pecanins in Barcelona in 1972, the Ex-convento del Carmen in Guadalajara in 1973 and his last exhibition at the Galería Pecanins of Mexico City in 1975. Before his death, there was a retrospective of his work at the ExConvento del Carmen in Guadalajara. His work achieved popularity in the United States, South America and Europe as well as Mexico. His works have since been displayed at the Foggs Museum in Boston and the Haymarket Gallery in London.
He was a collector and seller of antiques and art, especially colonial art and Mexican handcrafts and folk art. He was one of the pioneers of the movement to appreciate these forms in the 20th century. He was an important promoter of folk and colonial art in Mexico, stating that it was important to understanding the fine arts of the 20th century in Mexico. In both his homes in Guadalajara and Mexico City he sold art and antiques, as well as added to his own collection. He had a good eye for art and antiques, winning the admiration of other collectors such as Franz Mayer. By the time he died, the collection included thousands of objects including 180 paintings, sculptures and other arts from the 17th to 19th centuries which were exhibited in a show called La Mirada Estetica de Jesus Reyes Ferreira at the Museo de Arte Moderno in 2002. 
He also worked with architects as an advisor on color schemes and decoration. He worked with Luis Barragán in San Ángel in the 1950s.
His first recognition as an artist was in 1962 from the Palacio de Bellas Artes. In 1972 a gallery in San Angel was named after him, holding an exhibition of his work. In 1977 he was honored at the Universidad de Guadalajara along with Raúl Anguiano, Carlos Orozco Romero and Pedro Medina “El Charro” receiving the José Clemente Orozco medal. His biography by Lily Kassner was published by Editorial RM in 2000.
Artistry.
One unique aspect to Reyes Ferreira’s work is that it was painted mostly on fragile crepe paper and sometimes cardboards, materials not made to last. He generally painted early in the morning for the light and never used an easel. He laid the crepe paper out over a silk base flat on a table in order to withstand the painting process. A scientific analysis shows that he mixed oils, plant based paints and gouaches. The works are fragile and degrade with time, making documentation the only way to preserve them.
His works have simple lines with a naïve quality, but also with bold colors. It shows influence from Mexican folk art, colonial art and pre Hispanic art as well as popular architecture. The images he painted include roosters, circus acts, angels, skeletons, horses and flowers. There is influence from traditional handcrafts in the depictions of toys. His depictions were not always traditional and included dolls dressed as prostitutes. He was religious which led him to paint images of Christ and the Virgin Mary as well as monks, saints, Adam and Eve, cherubs, angels and devils. He also painted images of dead girls with a sense of Christian piety depicting them as angels. 
His work has been described as Surrealist, and his use of reduced forms described as Expressionist. His images use bold colors which stray from their forms.
He was self-taught, never accepting the title of “painter.” He claimed that he did not paint but rather “cover in mud” or “smear colors.” However, his work impressed others. Reyes Ferreira met Marc Chagall when the latter came to Mexico for a performance of the Aleko Ballet. Reyes Ferreira went to the Palacio de Bellas Artes to give some of his paintings to the Russian, which he humbly called “papers.” Chagall was impressed with the work, calling Reyes Ferreiro the “Mexican Chagall.” On one occasion Picasso remarked about his work that is was fresh and it must be from a young artist, when Reyes Ferreira was 70. Carlos Monsiváis called his work “a song of happiness.”
Reyes Ferreira’s two main influences were José Clemente Orozco, also from Guadalajara and José Guadalupe Posada, as can be seen with images of skulls with flowers. Unlike these two, his work was not social criticism. His images are based on popular and folk art but without obvious effort to promote Mexican identity such as was the case with Mexican muralism even though Reyes Ferreira admired Orozco. He influenced a number of architects in color schemes such as Luis Barragan, Mathias Goeritz, Max Cetto, Juan Sordo Madaleno and Ricardo Legorreta . He was admired by many architects and others for his sense of aesthetics although his wilder ideas were not or could not be executed.
There has been no systematic or in-depth study of his work. One reason for this is that for many years, art critics dismissed his art as folk painting, with his activities as a collector and antiques dealer considered more important. Although part of a number of museum collections, they are generally not on display or in museum catalogs of the most important Mexican museums such as MUNAL or the Museo de Arte Moderno. The Fundación Luis Barragán holds 194 of his works which were either sold or given to the architect. Despite the lack of museum attention, the works have been frequently forged.

Labour gains were as follows: Bramley, Burmantofts, Gipton, Osmondthorpe, Richmond Hill, Scott Hall, Seacroft, Stanningley, Whinmoor and Wortley. There was also a narrow hold in Burley, with Labour close to eliminating the almost 40% Conservative majority managed there the year before. The Liberals further increased their representation with a gain from the Conservatives, repeating their success in West Hunslet following the previous year's upset.

Richard Saumarez

Richard Saumarez (1764–1835) was born on Guernsey on 13 Nov. 1764. Both parents died when he was young, and he later went to London to study medicine at the London Hospital. He was admitted a member of the Surgeons' Company on 7 April 1785. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1834.
In 1788, Saumarez became surgeon to the Magdalen Hospital, Streatham, until 1 March 1805 when he was appointed an honorary governor. He had a large and lucrative practice in London until 1818, when he retired to Bath, where he died on 28 Jan. 1835.
Saumarez was a prolific writer, with advanced ideas regarding the subject of medicine and medical education. Coleridge identified and praised Saumarez for his "masterly force of reasoning, and the copiousness of induction, with which he has assailed, and (in my opinion) subverted the tyranny of the mechanic system in physiology; established not only the existence of final causes, but their necessity and efficiency to every system that merits the name of philosophical; and, substituting life and progressive power for the contradictory inert force, has a right to be known and remembered as the first instaurator of the dynamic philosophy in England." ("Biographia Literaria," Chapter 12)
New Physiology.
Bacon, Hunter and True Science.
Saumarez dedicates his book on physiology to Dr. John Hunter amongst others.
Saumarez also praises Bacon for having set down a true method of approach to nature, through direct observation based on clear ideas, not just the collection of facts.
True science for Saumarez is designed to analyse facts to arrive at the necessary historical understanding and basic or first principles which takes sense impression to understanding.
Saumarez argued that the level of knowledge in his day was poor and corrupted by false principles. In particular, the study of chemistry was not only still ignorant of the principles of "elective attraction," but sought to extend the principles that only held for dead and common matter to the realm of living matter.
Three Systems of Matter.
Instead of the usual classification into animal, vegetable and mineral, Saumarez proposes a classification based on 'matter.'
Saumarez distinguishes between the property of living matter that is general and diffused through the whole system, and active - materia vitae diffusa - and that which is particular and dormant. The former maintains the preservative (sustentive) and participative (generative) capacity of a living organism. The principle of life is the principium vitae diffusum. We could also say that the former is the inherent capacity of the system to respond, and the latter is the result of the interaction of the former with the exciting powers, the stimuli of Dr. Brown and the Brunonian system of medicine. Saumarez claims that Hunter preceded Brown with his principle of a living principle, which Brown then expressed in the idea of excitation as the stimuli for bringing potential life or excitability to actual life or excitement.
Saumarez then also distinguishes between physiology and physics.
Different Laws for Different Systems of Matter.
Each system of matter "not only in the progress of its evolution, but in the actions it performs, is governed and impelled by laws, distinct and peculiar".
The laws and principles governing dead or common matter (chemistry) cannot be employed to any useful end in understanding living matter (physiology). As an example, the "assimilating and convertible power" or "converting power of the assimilating organ" found in digestion, as "proved by Mr. Hunter and Spallanzani" cannot be explained by chemical laws and actions, but must be performed by a "living power resident in the organ and its secretions, in this case, that of the gastric juice of animals and man." From all of his observations of the facts from previous experiments, Saumarez is led to the logical conclusion that "the process of digestion...is not a chemical, but a living, act." He is further led to conclude that this living power, which is able to first dissolve, diffuse and then re-arrange external matter into a new unified form, "pervades throughout the whole range of animated existence" whether animal or vegetable. And the essence of this living power is that it is able to overcome the chemical laws, so that they resist being reduced to the elements (entropy).
Saumarez also addresses the living power of the mind which is necessary to relate to living sense experience.
This correlates with his contemporary Coleridge's view of the imagination as a creative power (governed by laws that are 'the very powers of growth and production"), that is "vital, even as all objects (as objects) are essentially fixed and dead"). As with Coleridge, Saumarez sees mind and consciousness to be a creative function that is higher and greater than sense-experience, indeed, as Coleridge puts it, "in the mind's self-experience there are evidently two powers at work, which relatively to each other are active and passive; and this is not possible without an intermediate faculty, which is at once both active and passive." 
Duality of Living Power.
Saumarez also sees that the nature of this living power is both sustentive and generative, and has been spoken of throughout history in different ways, including most recently by Dr. John Brown.
Organization of Life.
Thus, what we see in living organisms is simply an organisation of powers, forces and energies according to real prototypes or ideas in the non-material, super-sensible domain. It is by way of this living power that health and disease derive.
This living power exists prior to any "organic action" and this pre-existing state Saumarez terms 'pre-disposition'. Like Brown, he also sees that the potential or dormant living power must be brought into action and motion.
Saumarez sees in the regular, organised functions and processes of living beings a unifying cause within the system itself, the living principle that keeps everything operating in a harmonious whole, both through the power of expansion, growth and that of containment or formation.
Living Power Not Simply Irritability.
This living power is not to be equated or reduced to the nervous or sensitive power of plants and animals. The first is extensive throughout and the second is more limited in extent, as not all plants and animals have it, or it does not operate throughout the organism, absolutely or equally (in health). The sensitive power, however, is generally prevalent in animals and gives them knowledge of the external world. The cause of sensation lies not so much in the object, but in the sensory organ receiving the impression. This sensitive power is the basis for the pleasure principle, and in its lower form, the instincts and their actions. In humans, however, there is something else besides the instincts.
Polarity Between Instinct and Consciousness.
In man, the animal instincts must be mastered and converted by a higher power, that of self-consciousness through the power of rational thought. Instinctual action is not freedom, but the path of degeneration for man. Saumarez also speaks of the power of the mind to integrate sensations. These connect with Locke's ideas on self-consciousness (see Romantic medicine) and Coleridge's ideas, noted above regarding the power of imagination, both primary and later, in a more conscious way, secondary imagination.
Mind and Consciousness.
Man is a reasoning and ideating being, not simply an instinctual one, and the development and evolution of consciousness allows him to direct and free himself from the compulsion of the instincts. As Saumarez states,
And this power of thought, an internal experience, is higher than that of sense experience ("the objects of intellect cannot be derived from objects of sense; otherwise, they would be subordinate, and not superior to sensible things"). The objects of sense experience are there to help man perfect his self-awareness and self-consciousness and "perfect", that is, raise his mind and consciousness to higher levels, all the way up to spirit, the main concern of Romantic epistemology (to overcome the split between Nature and God or Spirit).
Like Brown, it is also those experiences that are agreeable or "congenial" that act to raise the mind and consciousness, and these resonant experiences then activate the mind to dwell on a higher and deeper, objective need against the subjective wants derived from the baser instincts.
This power of the mind (cognition) for Saumarez is self-contained and self-referential.
Physiology: Examples.
Saumarez provides many examples of living actions which cannot be explained by or reduced to chemical/physical processes.
After vegetable or animal food has been digested by a living system, the commutation it has sustained is total and complete...
Saumarez also takes from Hunter his example concerning the action of plant sap in a living and isolated context.
In another case that Saumarez provides we can also see the degeneration of living fluids, in this case hepatic bile, from a yellow, active state, to a greenish, almost black state when it becomes cystic bile. For Saumarez, this is a function of a law of nature governing organic action and involving a polarity between 'sensible' properties and 'living' properties, or between living matter and common matter.
In this regard, Saumarez also refers to functions of the mind, which increase as corporeal powers or vitality wanes, an idea also correlative to Coleridge's views on the creative imagination and mind, but also the reverse.

Iron Way

The Iron Way () is a ridgeway in the Ore Mountains in central Europe whose historic route follows the Ore Mountain Northern Escarpment ("Erzgebirgische Nordrandstufe").
According to local historic accounts, it is said to have been used in the Middle Ages for the transport of iron ore from the area around the Schneeberg.
The way, which is still signed today, starts at Katzenstein near Affalter and passes through the Streitwald to "Tabakstanne", continuing through the municipal forest, past the monument of the Black Cross ("Schwarzes Kreuz") to the hill of "Harthauer Berg" on the B 95 federal highway, south of Chemnitz.
Today, the Iron Way is a popular route for walkers and cyclists, linking the area south of Chemnitz with the trails of the central Ore Mountain region.

Municipality of Jerusalem

The Municipality of Jerusalem is an administrative division of the State of Israel in the Jerusalem District. Its boundaries are controversial and not recognized by most countries in the world.
Offices.
The municipal authorities are housed in the offices of the Mayor of Jerusalem, a complex of buildings. It was created in the 1990s around Safra Square in the Daniel Garden. It brings together all the activities of the Municipality that were previously located in 32 different buildings scattered throughout the city. The site of the city municipal offices was chosen in the mid-1980s because it was the center of the city between east and west, near the Old City and the historic main street of the city, Jaffa Street.
As this site is at the historic center of the city, various measures were taken so as to create buildings that met the practical needs of the town hall without damaging the architectural and historical character of the neighborhood. These considerations led to the preservation of various historical buildings that were renovated, and the construction of two modern buildings at three sites, primarily in Safra Square.

Cyclone Martin

Severe Tropical Cyclone Martin was the deadliest tropical cyclone of the 1997–98 South Pacific cyclone season. The system was first noted as a weak tropical disturbance on October 27, to the north of the Northern Cook Islands. Over the next few days atmospheric convection surrounding the system remained disorganized, as it moved towards the southwest and was affected by strong upper-level north-easterly winds and moderate to strong vertical wind shear. The system was subsequently named Martin during October 31, after it had rapidly developed further and shown a marked improvement organization.
Meteorological history.
On October 27, 1997 the Fiji Meteorological Service's Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji (RSMC Nadi) started to monitor a weak tropical disturbance that had developed to the north of the Northern Cook Islands. Over the next few days atmospheric convection surrounding the system remained disorganised, as the system moved to the southwest and was affected by strong upper-level north-easterly winds and moderate to strong vertical wind shear. Late on October 30, the United States Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center (NPMOC) designated the disturbance as Tropical Cyclone 04P, as it had become a tropical depression. During the next day the system started to show a marked improvement in organisation and began rapidly developing, before RSMC Nadi named it Martin at 1500 UTC after it had developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. When it was named, Martin was located about to the west of Manihiki Atoll in the Northern Cook Islands and had started to re-curve and move towards the south-east during that day. Early on November 1, RSMC Nadi reported that the system had become a category 2 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, before the NPMOC reported that Martin had become equivalent to a category one hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS). During that day as the cyclone season officially started, Martin continued to intensify and became a category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, as it passed about to the south of Manihiki.
During November 2, the system continued to intensify as it moved towards the southeast and became equivalent to a category 2 hurricane on the SSHWS, as it moved towards the French Polynesian Society Islands of Bellingshausen, Mopelia and Scilly. During the next day, Martin passed near the Society Islands as it developed an eye, before RSMC Nadi reported at 06:00 UTC that the system had peaked as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 155 km/h (100 mph). The NPMOC also reported at around that time that Martin had peaked with 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 185 km/h (115 mph), which made it equivalent to a category 3 hurricane on the SSHWS. After peaking in intensity Martin started to weaken, as it interacted with a frontal system and started to accelerate towards the south-southeast. During November 4, Martin passed within of Tahiti as it became a category 2 tropical cyclone and started to transition into an extratropical cyclone. Later that day, the NPMOC issued their final advisory on system as it had become equivalent to a tropical depression, vertically sheared with its surface center dislocated about from its upper level center. Early on November 5, RSMC Nadi reported that Martin had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale before passing the primary warning responsibility for the system to the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Wellington, New Zealand. Later that day TCWC Wellington reported that Martin had weakened below tropical cyclone intensity, before it was last noted on November 8 in the Southeastern Pacific ocean over to the southeast of Adamstown in the Pitcairn Islands.
Preparations, impact and aftermath.
While it was active Cyclone Martin affected both the Cook Islands and French Polynesia, and was responsible for 28 deaths. Due to the impact of this storm, the name Martin was retired from the lists of tropical cyclone names.
Cook Islands.
Martin was quite destructive at Manihiki Atoll. When the centre was closest to the island, the automatic weather station reported a lowest pressure of 994hPa, sustained winds of 20 m/s, and a highest gust of 29 m/s. However, this was the last meteorological report from the station before it was destroyed by storm surge. There were 10 fatalities recorded on Manihiki with 10 more persons reported missing and presumed drowned by the Cook Islands Coroner. Almost every building on the island was destroyed by the storm surge. Within the Cook Islands, Martin was the deadliest known tropical cyclone to affect the Cook Islands in over a century, after it caused 19 deaths within the Islands.
French Polynesia.
At its peak intensity, Martin passed near the western-most islands of the Socitey group (Bellingshausan, Mopelia, and Scilly) where 8 deaths were reported.

Andrea Thopia

Andrea Thopia or Andrew Thopia (? — after 1479), was 15th century noble man from Albania whose domains included the territory of Scuria (between Durazzo and what would later became modern day Tirana). He was a member of the Thopia family and one of the founders of the League of Lezhë.
Family.
Andrea Thopia was the nephew of Karl Thopia. 
1432—1436 rebellion.
After the Battle of Savra in 1385 the region of Albania became under strong Ottoman influence and gradually most of its territory was annexed to Ottoman Empire within separate administrative unit: the Sanjak of Albania. Andrea revolted against Ottoman rule in 1432 and defeated a small Ottoman military unit in the mountains of Central Albania. His victory inspired other chieftains in Albania, especially Gjergj Arianiti, to rebel against the Ottomans.
League of Lezhe.
Together with his nephew (Tanush Thopia) Andrea participated in founding of the League of Lezhë (1444 military alliance led by Skanderbeg). The members included Lekë Zaharia, Peter Spani, Lekë Dushmani, Andrea Thopia, Gjergj Arianiti, Theodor Musachi, Stefan Crnojević, and their subjects. His title was Lord of Scuria (near Durazzo).
According to Gjon Muzaka Andrea Thopia was among the members of this league who outlived the fall of Scutari into Ottoman hands in 1479.
In literature.
Girolamo de Rada, an Italian writer of Italo-Albanian literature, dedicated his 1839 work "Albanian Historical Songs of Serafina Thopia, Wife of Prince Nicholas Dukagjini" () to unfulfilled love of Serafina Thopia and Bosdare Stresa (an Albanian Romeo and Juliet). Serafina, who was daughter of Andrea Thopia in this song, sacrified her love to Bosdare and married Nicholas Dukagjini to help uniting southern and northern Albania to fight against the Ottomans.

The Green Leaves of Summer

"The Green Leaves of Summer" is a song with music by Dimitri Tiomkin and lyrics by Paul Francis Webster, written for the 1960 film "The Alamo". It was performed in the film's score by the vocal group The Brothers Four. In 1961 the song was nominated for an Academy Award; its parent soundtrack, for the film "The Alamo", was awarded a Golden Globe Award for "Best Original Score".
In "The Alamo", the song is heard on the last night before the Battle of the Alamo. Davy Crockett (John Wayne), when asked what he is thinking, responds "not thinking. Just remembering" as the song is heard. The men of the Alamo reminisce on their lives and reflect on their own mistakes, faith, and morality.
The song itself has no lyrical connection to the Alamo, or to any other historical events, but is simply a nostalgic reminiscence of the narrator's idyllic youth.
"The Green Leaves of Summer" has been covered by a number of musicians including Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass, Frankie Avalon, Kenny Ball, Ken Dodd, Anita Harris, Hampton Hawes, Mahalia Jackson, Frankie Laine, Patti Page, Peter and Gordon and The Ventures and Nick Perito. A French-language translation, "Le Bleu De L'été", was performed by both Michèle Arnaud and Maya Casabianca (fr). A Finnish-language translation, "Kesän Vihreät Lehvät", was performed by both Eino Grön and Vieno Kekkonen (fi).
The song had renewed interested when Nick Perito's version was featured in the title sequence of the 2009 film "Inglourious Basterds", directed by Quentin Tarantino.

Autumn In Disguise were a Scottish pop punk easycore band formed in Aberdeen in early 2010. Originally a six member band with two vocalists, they started playing shows in March 2010. They released their first song, a cover of Lady Gaga's "Bad Romance", for free on the group's Bandcamp. They went on to release their debut EP "See Me In Terror" on September 1, 2010, along with a music video for the song of the same name. 
The band spent much of their time touring Scotland. In 2011, the band stumbled across Red Bull's Bedroom Jam competition, which encouraged fans to vote for their favourite band. After performing live on the site, the band were voted as one of the eight contestants who would be getting to play T In The Park, Sonisphere, Download Festival, Hevy Festival and Underage Festival. The band were eliminated from the competition after the festivals while Page 44 went on to win.
During the competition, vocalist Aaron Robertson quit the band to return to his career as an IT support engineer. Although the band had lost members in the past, the loss of Aaron forced the band to take a break for a while to experiment with new sounds to suit one vocalist. In May 2011 the band unveiled their new image with "Let's Call This A Home Run", a song that premiered on Rocksound's website.
The same year the band released their mini-album "What Makes Life Better". Some tracks from the LP were debuted on the Aberdeen leg of their UK tour in October 2011. Steven Potter of "Dead Press" described vocalist Mike Hendo as an "obvious talent, but probably a little bit gay".
The band played the main stage at Hit The Deck Festival at Nottingham's Rock City in April 2012, with bands such as Kids In Glass Houses, Deaf Havana, Lower Than Atlantis, We Are The In Crowd and Of Mice & Men.
The band have supported many established acts in the past two years, including Four Year Strong, Deaf Havana, Yashin, A Loss For Words, The Dangerous Summer and MXPX.

Stanley M. Joseph started his first business in 1933 when he opened an appliance store. He began manufacturing kitchen ventilation hoods in 1948 selling them under the name Stanthony Ventomatic. Stanthony Corp was incorportated in 1950. For a brief period in 1950, apparently for publicity purposes, Jackie Coogan was reportedly employed as vice president of sales. 
Stanley was issued United States Patent 2,903,549 in 1959 for a small electric barbecue unit. He was also awarded a design patent for combination vent hood and warmer. The company reported large increases in sales of its indoor/portable barbecue units by 1962. Small electric appliance were marketed under the Stanthony name until the early 1970s.
Dacor was founded in 1965. 
In 1989 Stan Joseph was inducted into the National Kitchen & Bath Association Hall of Fame. His sons, Michael and Anthony Joseph were also inducted into the NKBA in 2004. Stephen Anthony Joseph became president in September, 2011.
In 2010, Dacor began a collaboration with BMW Group DesignworksUSA which led to the introduction of Distinctive 36” Gas Cooktop. A following product showed the introduction of a wall oven with an Android tablet acting as the controller. The Graphical user interface was designed by DesignworksUSA.

The Carter supercomputer and Purdue's other clusters are part of the Purdue Community Cluster Program, a partnership between ITaP and Purdue faculty. In Purdue's program, a "community" cluster is funded by hardware money from grants, faculty startup packages, institutional funds and other sources. ITaP's Rosen Center for Advanced Computing administers the community clusters and provides user support. Each faculty partner always has ready access to the capacity he or she purchases and potentially to more computing power when the nodes of other investors are idle. Unused, or opportunistic, cycles from Carter are made available to the National Science Foundation's XESEDE system and the Open Science Grid.
Users.
The Purdue departments and schools by which Carter and Purdue's clusters are used vary broadly, including Aeronautics and Astronautics, Agriculture, Agronomy, Biology, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Civil Engineering, Communications, Computer and Information Technology, Computer Science, Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, Electrical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology, Industrial Engineering, Materials Engineering, Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Physics, the Purdue Terrestrial Observatory and Statistics, among others.
DiaGrid.
Unused, or opportunistic, cycles from Carter are made available to XSEDE and the Open Science Grid using Condor software. Coates is part of Purdue's distributed computing Condor flock, which is the largest publicly disclosed distributed computing system in the world and the center of DiaGrid, a nearly 43,000-processor Condor-powered distributed computing network for research involving Purdue and partners at nine other campuses.
Naming.
The Carter cluster is named for Dennis Lee Carter, the retired vice president for marketing of Intel, who received his master’s degree in electrical engineering from Purdue in 1974. He is credited with creating and implementing the internationally recognized “Intel Inside” campaign, spurred by what Carter says was his recognition at the dawn of the PC age that Intel needed to begin talking to the general public, not just to the PC company design engineers who had been its traditional focus. The campaign created the first broad brand awareness of a microprocessor as a key ingredient in a personal computer and made Intel’s logo a feature on the outside of most of the world’s PCs, while its five-note jingle became one of the most recognizable tunes on television. Carter also worked with Intel President Andy Grove to create the iconic Pentium brand name. The Carter cluster continues ITaP's practice of naming new supercomputers after notable figures in Purdue's computing history.
