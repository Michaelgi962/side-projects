A.G. Lafley

Alan George "A.G." Lafley (born June 13, 1947) is the Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Procter & Gamble. Originally retired in 2010, he rejoined the Company on May 23, 2013. 
As CEO, Lafley is credited with revitalizing P&G under the mantra “Consumer is Boss,” with a focus on billion dollar brands like Crest, Tide, and Pampers. But he also brought in several new brands, like Swiffer and Febreze, by merging P&G’s internal resources with outside “open” innovation, referred to as Connect + Develop. 
Prior to rejoining P&G in 2013, Lafley consulted on business and innovation strategy, advising on CEO succession and executive leadership development, and coaching experienced, new, and potential CEOs. 
Early Years and Business Legacy.
Lafley graduated from Fenwick High School in Oak Park, Illinois, and earned an A.B. from Hamilton College in 1969. In 1970, after beginning a doctoral program at the University of Virginia, he took a commission with the U.S. Navy as a supply officer during the Vietnam War. Afterwards, he studied at Harvard Business School, receiving his M.B.A. in 1977. He joined P&G upon his graduation. 
With Lafley leading the company for most of the 2000s, P&G more than doubled sales since the beginning of the decade. During that time, the company’s portfolio of billion-dollar brands grew from 10 to 24 (including former brands Folgers and Actonel) and the number of brands with sales between $500 million and $1 billion increased five-fold with Lafley at P&G’s helm.
On average, P&G's annual organic sales grew 5%, annual core earnings-per-share grew 12%, and free cash flow productivity averaged 112% a year since 2001. Further, during Lafley’s tenure, the Company’s market capitalization more than doubled, making P&G one of the five most valuable companies in the U.S. and among the 10 most valuable companies in the world.
Lafley is credited with making P&G a more consumer-driven and externally focused company—and with shaping a far more diverse, open, curious and courageous, connected and collaborative culture in which "innovation is everyone’s job."
Recognition and Thought-Leadership.
A.G. is broadly recognized for his business leadership. He was awarded "CEO of the Year 2006" by Chief Executive Magazine and the Peter G. Peterson Award for Business Statesmanship presented by the CED in 2009. In 2010, Lafley received the Edison Achievement Award, in recognition of his contributions to innovation, marketing, and human-centered design. He was also recognized with the 2010 Hall of Achievement Award, the highest honor given by the Grocery Manufacturers Association. In 2011, Lafley was awarded the Warren Bennis Award for Leadership Excellence and inducted into the IndustryWeek Manufacturing Hall of Fame. In 2012, Lafley was inducted into the prestigious Advertising Hall of Fame.
In 2008, Lafley and strategy consultant Ram Charan published "The Game Changer," an operating manager's guide to turning innovation into strategic advantage. Business Week selected The Game Changer as one of the year's "Top Ten Business Books." Mr. Lafley has also authored several critically acclaimed articles for Harvard Business Review, including “What Only the CEO Can Do” (May, 2009), “Executive Pay: Time for CEOs to Take a Stand” (May, 2010), “I Think of My Failures as a Gift” (April 2011), and “The Art and Science of Finding the Right CEO” (October, 2011) co-authored with notable author and leadership consultant, Noel M. Tichy.
In 2013, Lafley and Roger Martin wrote "Playing to Win", a practical approach to winning strategy--explaining what strategy is for (winning) and what it’s about (choice).

Robert Backhouse

Robert Ormston Backhouse (March 10, 1854 – April 10, 1940) was a British archer who competed at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. He and his wife, Sarah Dodgson were also known for producing new varieties of daffodils and lilies.
He was born in Darlington, County Durham and died in Sutton St. Nicholas, Herefordshire.
Backhouse entered the double York round event in 1908, taking 13th place with 516 points. He also shot a round in the manner of the Continental style event, but as a demonstration rather than in the actual competition. He scored 260 points, which would have given him a silver medal if his competition had been official. Backhouse received a Diploma of Merit for his effort in the Continental style.
Horticulture.
At their home, Sutton Court in Herefordshire, he and his wife, Sarah, continued the botanical interests of his grandfather, William Backhouse (1779–1844), and father, William Backhouse (1807–1869), and spent much time in cultivating daffodils and lilies. His brothers, Charles and Henry also raised daffodils as did his son William Ormston Backhouse (1885–1962). The popular daffodil variety, Mrs. R. O. Backhouse, the first daffodil with a pink cup and white perianth, was among the ones they developed and named for her by her husband after her death in 1921.

Masabih al-Sunnah

Masabih al-Sunnah is a collection of hadith by the Persian Shafi'i scholar Abu Muhammad al-Husayn ibn Mas'ud ibn Mubammad al-Farra' al-Baghawi, from sometime before 516 H. An improved version of this work, Mishkat al-Masabih, has additional hadith, and was the work of another Persian traditionist Al-Tabrizi d. 741H.
Description.
The collection is divided into a number of books which are divided into chapters which are further divided into two separate sections, one for Sahih ahadeeth as labeled by him ( from the collections of Bukhari and Muslim), the second section was for hasan ahadeeth according to his own labelling (from Al-Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud and others). Al-Tabrizi would alter certain ahadeeth positions in his own collection.

<doc id="5942470" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5942470" title="Robert G. Lowery">
Robert G. Lowery

Robert G. Lowery, Sr. (born 1940) was the mayor of the city of Florissant, Missouri in northern St. Louis County, Missouri, since November, 2001. Before becoming mayor, Lowery served as a police officer and the police chief of Florissant and has served the citizens of Florissant in various capacities for nearly 50 year. He has stated that "I truly, truly love Florissant".
Upon the death of Mayor James J. Eagan in November 2000 Council President John Moran was Mayor pro tempore and the successor to the position of mayor. 
Lowery was elected Mayor on February 6, 2001 in a special election to fill the unexpired term of James Eagan. The election had a turn out of 32% of 32,467 registered voters, with Lowery winning the election with 7,057 votes, 68% of the votes cast.
Law Enforcement Career.
Lowery was a police officer in the city of Florissant for 41 years. During this time he served as police chief for 22 years from 1979 until he was elected mayor in 2001. Lowery was elected to the Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission and headed up the St. Louis County Police Department's Major Case Squad for 20 years. In 1999 a thief stole police chief Lowery's gun and holster while he was trying on pants at St. Louis Centre.
Throughout his career as police chief Florissant was consistently ranked as one of the safest cities in America.
When elected mayor, Lowery selected Stephen Kruse to become his replacement as police chief. Kruse then resigned to accept a new position working in the private sector. On November 1, 2002, Lowery officially appointed William Karabas to be the city's police chief.
Mayoral campaigns, 2001, 2003, 2007.
2001 special election.
In November 2000 the Mayor of Florissant, James J. Egan, died from medical complications. A special election to fill the unexpired term of Mayor was held on February 6, 2001. Lowery, David L. Reynolds, and Glen W. Lindemann ran. 10,435 voters showed up on election day giving the majority (7,057) to Lowery.
2003 campaign and re-election.
In the election of 2003 Lowery ran unopposed.
2007 campaign and re-election.
In the election of 2007 Lowery ran against Andrew G. Podleski, winning by a margin of 1162 votes.
Mayoralty.
Lowery has been the Mayor of Florissant since the special election after the death of the then current Mayor James Eagan.
Community Redevelopment.
Since taking office, Lowery led the way to many new renovations in the City of Florissant.
The first of these changes came in 2002, in the part of Florissant near Lindbergh Boulevard and New Halls Ferry Road known as Cross Keys. The area had formerly been a small shopping mall with only a few tenants left. The tenants that remain included a supermarket, a pharmacy, and a fashion store, all of which are still located near the area where the new shopping center replacing the mall that once stood their. Adding to the shopping center were several new restaurants and shops including a bookstore. This had been in the Eagan Florissant city plan prior to Lowery taking office. 
Lowery's improvements are not limited to the Cross Keys neighborhood. A new bicycling and walking path that extends from the Sunset Park along the Missouri River to St. Ferdinand Park was recently completed in 2006. The path, most of which runs along the same path a some high voltage powerlines, connects much of western Florissant with the main section of Florissant via a foot bridge for pedestrians and cyclists. Much of the city is divided by Coldwater Creek, which has some natural and man-made tributaries that separate various neighborhoods from Berkeley, Hazelwood, Florissant, Black Jack, until pouring into the Missouri River in unincorporated St. Louis County. A similar footbridge plan was slated to connect the Wedgewood subdivision to a foot path leading to St. Ferdinand Park's east entrance, but because of strong opposition by residents in the neighborhood, this plan never became possible. 
Though the commercial redevelopment of Cross Keys is a success, much of the city's other commercial areas are still in need of the same renovation, especially the Florissant Meadows section of town near the city's historic Old Town area.
Personal and City Security.
Lowery has been fearful of his security since taking office. He has said that "every city has people who are really on the edge. We have 25 or 30 who are convinced that everything bad that's happening to them is the government's fault. And the closest government to them is City Hall." To quell his fears, Lowery has had security cameras installed at City Hall and is considering adding metal detectors to the entrances. Lowery has also had an increased police prescience in city council meetings and has also installed metal detectors for security screening of attendees. 
In addition during Lowery's term the city has purchased surveillance cameras to be deployed throughout the city, despite some citizens concerns about privacy issues.
Controversies.
Lowery has come under some controversy during his mayorship.
Eminent Domain.
According to a "Wall Street Journal" article published on August 3, 2005, a development firm turned down a $30 million project to construct condominiums, lofts, and retail space when the owner of a piece of vacant land refused to sell. According to city officials, the developer did not want the negative publicity due to the controversy of eminent domain and eminent domain abuse. The company defended their pull-out stating poor soil conditions and flooding in addition to eminent domain issues were to blame.
Lowery commented "The company did not want the adverse publicity. People don't understand what eminent domain is. They think it's always taking grandma out of her house, and that's not true. I wouldn't touch anything like that. That's political disaster."
The developers had plans on building in Florissant's Old Town historic district, where many building are registered as historic buildings. The idea of putting an upscale development project certainly would not have been a suitable area. However, the project might have been ideal for areas such as the east side of the city where many buildings and businesses have become run down or closed.
While Mayor Lowery and former Florissant city coucilwoman Geri Debo pushed to promote the Old Town Florissant area as an Old St. Charles type area to potential businesses, the area did attract a few new stores, but the promised increased foot traffic did not come to fruition and those businesses closed and had problems selling their property.
Busch Wildlife.
Another controversy that Lowery has tried to keep quiet about is his support for his son, Robert Lowery, Jr.
Robert Lowery, Jr. is the city administrator for the city of O'Fallon, Missouri in nearby St. Charles County, Missouri. Since taking office, the elder Lowery has quietly supported his son on various issues including the annexation of August A. Busch Memorial Conservation Area in nearby Weldon Springs, Missouri. While the younger Lowery stated that the annexation was an attempt to be viewed as a "good neighbor." But a local government watchdog group as well as a few other city officials determined the plan to be a case of backdoor politics. As a fifth ward, the wildlife preserve owned by Adolphus Busch IV and maintained by the Missouri Department of Conservation would have allowed developers to move in and whittle away the property for urban sprawl. Lowery argued that if the city did not annex the land, another nearby town would.
On June 14, 2007, the O'Fallon city council unanimously opposed the annexation for now. Attending the meeting was Mr. Busch.
Many people in O'Fallon, St. Charles County, as well as patrons of Busch Wildlife and an independent watchdog group would like to see Lowery step down not only for the Busch Wildlife incident but other instance of corruption within the O'Fallon government.
On June 24, 2009 the St. Louis Post Dispatch reported that Lowery, Jr. has tendered his resignation as O'Fallon City Administrator.

Yōka Wao

Her nicknames are Takako (from her real name: Takako Ōkawa (大川 貴子 "Ōkawa Takako") and Wao.
She is the only Otokoyaku to be top in her class as well as the last otokoyaku top star to have joined the company during the Shōwa era.
She is born and raised in Osaka (according to Takarazuka Graph 2003 April issue).
General information.
Wao first attracted attention when she played the role of Oscar in the New Actor Show of 1989 Snow Production "Rose of Versailles". Later on, she took the leading role in the New Actor Show of "High and Low". After graduating from the New Actor Show cast, she progressed to playing solid supporting roles in the main troupe productions. One of her notable roles during the Maki Ichiro era is Elmer in the 1997 production of Elizabeth. When Kouju Tatsuki, who played Rudolf in the Grand Theater, changed troupes, Wao took the role for the Tokyo performance.
She got her first Takarazuka Bow Hall show ("Grand Shanghai") in 1995 and the second one ("Wuthering Heights") in 1997.
With the retirement of Maki Ichiro and her successor Fubuki Takane, Wao became the firm second man for Yū Todoroki in Snow Troupe before she was selected for the new Cosmos Troupe in 1998. She continued to be the second man in Cosmos Troupe until the resignation of Asato Shizuki. She became the top star of Cosmos Troupe in 2000 and when she retired in 2006, she had had the longest run ever as male-role top star of all time.
With a height of 174 cm, she was the tallest star among her peer top stars such as Mire Aika (Flower), Hibiki Takumi (Flower), Tsubasa Makoto (Moon), Jun Shibuki (Moon), Yū Todoroki (Snow), Yū Emao (Snow), Kō Minoru (Star) and Tatsuki Kōju (Star).
She is one of the three actresses to portray both Emperor Franz Joseph and Prince Rudolph in Elizabeth (the other are Sakiho Juri and Mao Ayabuki) and is one of two actresses to portray Rudolf in two different musicals (Elizabeth and Mayerling), the other being Ouki Kaname, the current top star of the Cosmos troupe.
In December 2005, she injured herself during the performance of "W-Wing" (her personal concert) but was able to come back for "Never Say Goodbye", her last musical with Takarazuka.
In January 2007, she had her first personal concert since she left the company.
Right now, she is considered as an independent artist as she and her top star partner Mari Hanafusa have founded their own private office "Wao Enterprise" with Hanafusa as her manager. It is rare that top star partners who have left the company would continue to work together in such close relationship.
While having her second concert ("New Yoka ～Rockin' Broadway～") at Tokyo in August 2007, she was the guest star for Russell Watson's concert at Tokyo later on. Watson and she performed at Rokuonji Temple.
Her first movie was "Chacha: Tengai no Onna", which she plays as the leading actress in the role of Lady Chacha. The movie premiered in Japan on December 22, 2007. She later received the award of Best Actress at the Osaka Cinema Festival for this role.
In 2008, it was announced that she will be Velma Kelly for the Japanese version of Chicago with Ryoko Yonekura as Roxie and Ryuichi Kawamura as Billy in October and November. This was marked as her first musical drama outside Takarazuka.
Wao is currently set to star in "Dracula, the Musical", another Frank Wildhorn production, in August 2011. This is her first otokoyaku role outside of Takarazuka, and she is the first female to play the role.
Wao, Kozuki and "Elisabeth".
Wataru Kozuki, who is a year junior than Wao, shares some similarities of their career related to "Elisabeth":

Syracuse Blitz

The Syracuse Blitz was a Professional Indoor Football League (PIFL) team that played one exhibition game in 1998 and was going to join the league officially in 1999.
The franchise was originally awarded to Buffalo, NY as the Buffalo Blitz on June 16, 1997. The move was part of a rush brought on by the threat of the Buffalo Bills' lease expiration, which had led to speculation that the Bills would leave Buffalo (speculation that turned out to be unfounded as an extension was reached). The Blitz was owned by Don Angelo, Bryan Perry, and a group of area investors. At that time, they were negotiating with the University at Buffalo & Buffalo State College for playing sites for the upcoming PIFL season. In September of '97, the Arena Football League announced their next franchise would be in Buffalo also, later on known as the Buffalo Destroyers. This forced the move of the PIFL "Blitz" to Syracuse, NY.
After one scheduled tryout (Feb. 21, 1998), the Syracuse Blitz did not come together in time for the 1998 PIFL season, so the team had changed their plans to enter the league in 1999. The "Blitz" in fact did play one exhibition game against the Louisiana Bayou Beast at the Pete Maravich Assembly Center on the Louisiana State University campus in Baton Rouge, LA on July 4, 1998. The Beast won the exhibition game 39-18. The "Blitz" wore all black uniforms with all black helmets (no logos used).
The Syracuse Blitz never did take to the field in the 1999 regular season, as the league changed its name to the Indoor Professional Football League that season.

Top Management (video game)

Gameplay.
Using the management skills provided by the game, he/she must turn his/her fledgling into a profitable super corporation. Created by Koei, the game was geared towards Japanese business students in high school, college, and university while also attempting to appeal to casual gamers who have an interest in learning how a Japanese corporation is operated.
Literacy in the Japanese language is required in addition to advanced arthimetic skills. "Top Management" features abstract art that serves as the game's graphics. A general business meeting is always held on the beginning of April as a measure to set things like employment levels, executive salaries in addition to financial benefits for the employees. Meetings held on every other month of year focus on spreading advertisement throughout Japan in addition to improving the performance of the products and determining how many products to manufacture into the open market.
The game is mostly text-based and players can choose between five major electronics companies to play as (IBM, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Sharp, and NEC). Like most business games, bankruptcy ends the game with a game over. The NEC PC-9801 version was sold primarily as a research guide into the Japanese business world; with the ability to purchase licenses for up to 10 students and a teacher's version.
Sequel.
A sequel named "Top Management II" was later released for the Super Famicom in addition to the Windows operating system and for the NEC PC-9801.

Night Eagle

Night Eagle is a fictional character from DC Comics. She first appears in "The Adventures of Superman" #586 (December 2000), and was created by J.M. DeMatteis and Mike Miller. She is a shaman of sorts, with a kinship with owls.
Fictional character biography.
When Satanus tried to corrupt Metropolis with dark magic, Superman tried to intervene, but was overwhelmed by a powerful spell from the demon. As globes of dark power engulfed Superman, a flock of barn owls flew in and destroyed the globes. Superman looked up to see a Native American woman in an owl-like costume, who told Superman to "You can longer trust your eyes, you can only trust your heart", before she vanished.
Later, Superman followed an owl to a building, on which the woman stood, and she introduced herself as "Night Eagle". As magical foes and demons began attacking Metropolis, she would guide him on how to beat them. But when Satanus threatened to destroy the "soul of the city", Superman offered his soul in exchange. The result was that Superman was evil, as his soul was trapped in Hell.
Night Eagle appeared to Lois Lane and helped her enter Hell. There Lois helped Superman free himself, and the two defeated Satanus. Night Eagle then vanished, but not before her face became turned in to the face of Satanus's sister, Blaze. Night Eagle's current status and identity are unknown.
Powers and abilities.
Night Eagle is an agent of light, a bridge between the physical world and the afterlife. Night Eagle can see into the afterlife, and see magical energies. She has the power to fly, and can disperse spells and dark magic with her owls (who seem to obey her thoughts). She can appear to one or two people, while being invisible to all others, and cannot be touched by physical entities.

Poker dice

Poker dice are dice which, instead of having number pips, have representations of playing cards upon them. Poker dice have six sides, one each of an Ace, King, Queen, Jack, ten and nine, and are used to form a poker hand.
The classic poker dice game is played with 5 dice and two or more players. Each player has a total of 3 rolls and the ability to hold dice in between rolls. After the three rolls the best hand wins. Neither a "flush" nor a "straight flush" is a possible hand, due to the lack of suits on the dice. (Each variety of poker dice varies slightly in regards to suits, though the ace of spades is almost universally represented. 9♣ and 10♦ are frequently found, while face cards are traditionally represented not by suit but instead by color: red for kings, green for queens and blue for jacks. Manufacturers have not standardized the colors of the face sides.)
Marlboro once marketed a set of octahedral poker dice that included suits; each die had slightly different numberings, ranging from 7 up to ace. A similar set are currently manufactured by Koplow Games.
In 1974 Aurora produced a set of 12 sided poker dice called "Jimmy the Greek Odds Maker Poker Dice" and in 2000 Aurora/Rex Games produced a similar set under the name "Royal Poker Dice". The sets featured 5 12 sided dice allowing for all 52 playing cards to be represented. The remaining 8 faces featured stars and acted as wild cards allowing for every possible poker hand to be rolled.
Probabilities.
The poker dice hand rankings and the corresponding probabilities of rolling that hand are as follows (not sorted by probability but from highest to lowest ranking):
Busts are much lower probability than in card poker, because there are only 6 values instead of 13, making pairs and straights much more likely than with cards. In poker dice there are in fact only four possible bust hands: K Q J 9, K Q 10 9, K J 10 9, and Q J 10 9; both other no-pair hands (i.e., in which either the A or the 9 are missing) are straights. Consequently, in some variants of the rules, straights are counted as busts.

<doc id="5942605" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5942605" title="Jinyiwei">
Jinyiwei

The Jinyiwei was the imperial military secret police that served the emperors of the Ming dynasty in China. The Jinyiwei was founded by the Hongwu Emperor in 1368 to serve as his personal bodyguards and it developed into a military organisation the following year. They were authorised to overrule judicial proceedings in prosecutions, with full autonomy granted in arresting, interrogating and punishing anyone, including nobles and the emperor's relatives.
The Jinyiwei were also tasked with collecting military intelligence on the enemy and participated in battle planning stages. A Jinyiwei guard donned a distinctive golden-yellow uniform, with a tablet (pictured) worn on his torso, and carried a special blade weapon.
History.
The Jinyiwei originated as early as 1360. They served as Zhu Yuanzhang's personal bodyguards and defended him during a battle with the warlord Chen Youliang. After Zhu founded the Ming dynasty and became the Hongwu Emperor, he doubted his subjects' loyalties towards him and was constantly on guard against possible rebellions and assassinations. One of the early duties of the Jinyiwei was to help the emperor spy on his subjects. The Hongwu Emperor increased the Jinyiwei's duties later, allowing them to inspect his officials at work in the capital city, before formally establishing the organisation in 1382, with about 500 members. Their numbers increased to around 14,000 in three years.
In 1393, the Hongwu Emperor reduced the Jinyiwei's duties after they allegedly abused their authority during the investigation of a rebellion plot by Lan Yu, in which about 40,000 people were implicated and executed. When the Yongle Emperor ascended to the throne, he was afraid that his subjects might be discontented with him, because he came to power by usurping his nephew's throne. He reinstated the Jinyiwei's authority to increase his control over the imperial court. The Jinyiwei was disbanded after 262 years of existence when Li Zicheng's rebel forces overthrew the Ming dynasty in 1644.
Service.
The Jinyiwei were authorised to overrule judicial proceedings in prosecuting those deemed as enemies of the state, granted with full autonomy in arresting, interrogating, detaining them without trial and punishing them, without going through due process. They were bound to the service of the emperor and took direct orders from him. They also served as political commissars for the Ming armies in times of war. In the later years of the Ming dynasty, the Jinyiwei were placed under the control of the eunuch faction. As the government sank into corruption, the Jinyiwei was constantly used as a means of eliminating political opponents through assassinations and legal prosecutions.

Michel Waisvisz

Michel Waisvisz (8 July 1949, Leiden – 18 June 2008, Amsterdam) was a Dutch composer, performer and inventor of experimental electronic musical instruments. He was the artistic director of STEIM in Amsterdam from 1981, where he collaborated with musicians and artists from all over the world.
Biography.
His involvement with STEIM goes back until 1969, when it had been co-founded by his mentor and friend Dick Raaymakers. He has been a member of Amsterdam's Electric Music Theatre scene of the 1970s, performing intensively and raising critical voices against the upcoming high-tech culture.
He co-founded and organised the first sound festival in the Netherlands:The Claxon Sound Festival.
Waisvisz had a passionate dedication to a physical, bodily approach to electronic music which he has expressed in the use and presentation of his many developments of hardware and software instruments. From his point of view electronic music is created in direct musical interaction with individual technology, allowing for instant travels into sound through improvisation. This multidimensionality in electronic musical practice has been summed up in the expression of Touch in an essay together with Joel Ryan and Sally Jane Norman in 1998.
Musical instruments.
Hardware Instruments:
"TapePuller (1970):" an instrument to play seated, pulling a tape with both feet over the tapehead, thus using the recording medium in a performative manner.
"CrackleBox (1974):" a portable instrument with batteries and a built-in speaker. The oscillator is played by the direct touch of the fingers on the exposed contacts of the circuit. The player's skin becomes part of the circuit.
"CrackleSynth (1974):" Michel Waisvisz' individual synthesizer. After bending a VCS3 Synth (the "Putney") in the early 70s to play it with a touchable "crackle" surface, this three voiced instrument became Michel Waisvisz' synthesizer development. It has 12 keys with tuning knobs combined with three crackle-patches.
"The Hands (1984):" One year after the MIDI standard had been introduced, Waisvisz built the first experimental interface making use of sensor data converted into MIDI. The two wooden frames attached to both hands let him play music with hand and arm movements, tilting gestures, and fingered playing. Converting analog sensor data into digital musical data has become a major issue at STEIM in the 1990s, introducing the mini computer The SensorLab.
Software instruments.
He has also worked on the creation of software instruments, developed with STEIM's programmer Frank Baldé:'"
Software for the Mac, processing live audio input, or data from the memory in a most versatile way.
Converting sensor data into musical data today can be done by every laptop computer.
The Energetica Project (since 2005)
"Energetica" is Waisvisz' vision of electricity provided for electronic instruments by the effort of the player him/ herself, theoretically developed in the last years of his life. As he has always fought pre-configurations and built-in directions in technology, the subjection to the communal power supplies.
Michel Waisvisz' collaborations include performances with Maarten Altena, Laurie Anderson, Tarek Atoui, Frank Baldé, Lodewijk de Boer, Willem Breuker, Peter Brötzmann, Najib Cheradi, John Cameron (Claw Boys Claw), Truus de Groot, Gunter Hampel, Paul Hubweber, Shelley Hirsch, Mazen Kerbaj, Steve Lacy, Misha Mengelberg, Patrizia van Roessel, Joel Ryan, Christine Sehnoaui, Fausto Senese, Shusaku, Laetitia Sonami, DJ sniff, DJ Spooky, Richard Teitelbaum, Moniek Toebosch, Jan St. Werner, Frans Zwartjes.

KBDS

KBDS (103.9 FM) is a radio station licensed to serve Taft, California. The station is owned by Radio Campensina Bakersfield, Inc., which is itself owned by the United Farm Workers. While the station normally broadcasts to the Kern County, California, area, as of November 14, 2008, it is temporarily off the air.
Before the station was silenced on November 14, 2008, it broadcast a Rhythmic Top 40 music format. Branded as "Play 103.9", the station's slogan was "Blazin' Hip Hop Y Mas."
History.
This station received its original construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission on January 18, 1985. The new station was assigned the call letters KTLM by the FCC on December 3, 1985. During that time, the station featured a "Big Band" format, playing Swing Era music from the 1930s and 40's. In March 1988, Louise E. Mann's Mann Broadcasting Company reached an agreement to transfer the permit for this station to The Great Southwest Broadcasting Company. The deal was approved by the FCC on April 27, 1988, and the transaction was consummated on September 13, 1988.
KTLM received its license to cover from the FCC on August 22, 1989. However, in July 1989 Bakersfield Radio Partners L.P. reached an agreement to acquire this station's permit and license. The deal was approved by the FCC on November 1, 1989, and the transaction was consummated on December 19, 1989. The new owners had the FCC change the station's callsign to KMYX-FM on January 8, 1990. By that point, the station was broadcasting a "soft rock" format featuring adult contemporary hits of the 1970s and 80's.
In July 1993, Bakersfield Radio Partners reached an agreement to sell this station to Adelman Communications, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on September 2, 1993, and the transaction was consummated on October 1, 1993. The format switched once again to country, with the monicre "Thunder Country".
In June 1994, Adelman Communications, Inc., reached an agreement to sell this station to Radio Campesina Bakersfield, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on July 13, 1994, and the transaction was consummated on August 4, 1994. The station was assigned the KBDS call letters by the FCC on March 2, 2000.
Prior to its flip to Rhythmic Top 40 in November 2004, KBDS' previous format was Regional Mexican. During its four-year run "Play 103.9" did well, despite competition from Rhythmic rival KISV ("Hot 94.1"), who they decided to take on after KKXX-FM flipped formats three months earlier in August 2004. Indeed, when KBDS went silent in November 2008, they were experiencing their highest 12+ Arbitron ratings to date.
Controversy.
On June 21, 2005, KBDS was sued by contest winner Shannon Castillo, claiming she was misled by the station's promotions to believe she had won a new Hummer H2. In fact, she and another winner were each presented with a remote-control toy model of an H2. The lawsuit seeking $60,000, the approximate cost of a real Hummer H2, further claims that KBDS ran a week's worth of promos mocking her as a victim of the station's April Fool's Day joke (even though the contest itself was a week long and started in March).
Silent.
On November 14, 2008, citing poor advertising sales and the state of the economy, KBDS let go its entire programming staff and went off the air. The station has formally applied to remain off the air for up to 180 days due to being "unable to operate profitably in the current economic climate".[http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn=101284195&formid=910&fac_num=456]. The FCC accepted the filing on December 11, 2008, but dismissed the request on November 16, 2009. The station had briefly resumed broadcasting in November 2009 to avoid the FCC rules that allows for automatic forfeiture of a broadcast license when a station is silent for more than one year. However, they fell silent again on November 17, 2009, and applied for new authority to remain silent, again citing financial reasons, on December 31, 2009. The FCC granted this authority on March 10, 2010, with a scheduled expiration of September 7, 2010.

Conowingo, Maryland

Conowingo is a small community in western Cecil County, Maryland, USA.
Conowingo is a Susquehannock word for "at the rapids".
Conowingo was originally located on the eastern bank of the Susquehanna River at the confluence of the Conowingo Creek with the river. Conowingo was at the rapids that were the first navigation obstacle on the Susquehanna upstream of the Chesapeake Bay, the location of an early stretch of canal. It was also the site of the Conowingo Bridge.
A 90 foot fall of the river at the rapids dictated the location of the Conowingo Dam and thus the resulting inundation of the Old Conowingo site by the subsequent Conowingo Reservoir. At the completion of the dam in 1928, the Conowingo Post Office was relocated to the hill above the dam.
Conowingo is not an incorporated municipality, nor a US Census Bureau census-designated place.
Octorara Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.
Conowingo Village.
A new town, named Conowingo Village, was created in 1928, on the Harford County side of the dam. It was initially a company town to house the dam's plant managers and workers. From the 1980s to 2000, the power company leased the homes to non-workers. In October, 2000, the village was shuttered. And in 2001 the power company donated the land to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and the buildings to the local fire companies for training.

He had been working in Neuchâtel since 1942, after working in l'Ecole d'art à La Chaux-de-Fonds between 1932 to 1935, and staying in Paris (between 1935 and 1936) and Italy for a few short periods of time. In Neuchâtel he taught Art and History of Art until 1956. In 1949 he again stayed in Paris, but returned to Neuchâtel later that year.
He was heavily influenced by Henry Moore. His sculptures can be seen in many public spaces, mostly in Switzerland.

Ryan Ludwick

Ryan Andrew Ludwick (born July 13, 1978) is a Major League Baseball outfielder for the Cincinnati Reds. His brother Eric also played four seasons in Major League Baseball as a pitcher. He is one of the few baseball players to bat right and throw left.
Playing career.
High school, college, and minor leagues.
Ludwick attended Durango High School in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Ludwick played for the UNLV Rebels for three seasons. He was named to the Baseball America all-Freshman team in after batting .354 with 46 home runs and 109 RBI and was All-WAC in , hitting .381 with 13 home runs and 69 RBI. Ludwick had a .363 career batting average at UNLV.
Ludwick was chosen in the second-round (60th overall) of the 1999 Major League Baseball Draft by the Oakland Athletics. He was traded to the Texas Rangers before the season, along with Gerald Laird, Jason Hart, and Mario Ramos, for first baseman Carlos Peña and pitcher Mike Venafro.
Texas Rangers, Cleveland Indians, back to minors.
Ryan Ludwick belongs to a very tiny group of Major League Baseball players: he bats right-handed and throws with his left. In the entire history of Major League Baseball through the 2008 season, and including the National Association of 1871-75 (not currently counted as a major league by MLB), only 57 players who played at least half their games at a position other than pitcher batted right and threw left. The most famous individual in this exclusive group is Hall-of-Fame outfielder Rickey Henderson.
Ludwick made his major league debut with the Rangers in , but his season was cut short when he fractured his hip the same year, an injury which significantly hampered his career. In , Ludwick was traded by the Rangers to the Cleveland Indians for pitcher Ricardo Rodríguez and outfielder Shane Spencer. He was designated for assignment and sent to Triple-A in June 2005
Ludwick spent the season playing for the Toledo Mud Hens, the Triple-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers, and was named to the International League team for the 2006 Triple-A All-Star Game. Ludwick enjoyed great success in the Detroit organization, but due to a surplus of outfielders, Detroit made the decision to not offer Ludwick a new contract.
St. Louis Cardinals: All-Star.
In , Ludwick was invited to spring training by the Cardinals and started in Triple-A Memphis. On May 6, , Ludwick was promoted to the Cardinals after Preston Wilson went on the DL. In the 29 games preceding Ludwick's promotion, he hit .340 with 0 home runs but 50 rbi at Memphis.
His fast start in earned him an everyday player role. Ludwick was named to his first All-Star game on July 6 at Yankee Stadium in New York City. He won the National League Player of the Week Award for July 27-August 2. On August 14, Ludwick hit his 29th home run of the 2008 season; this broke the record for the most home runs in a season by a player who throws left-handed yet bats right-handed previously held by Rickey Henderson.
Ludwick would go on to win a Silver Slugger Award at the end of the 2008 season for his offensive performance along with fellow outfielders Matt Holliday and Ryan Braun. That year, Ludwick hit 37 home runs, 40 doubles, 3 triples and a solid .299 Batting Average.
After his breakout season of 2008, Ludwick started out with a solid April, posting similar figures to his 2008 season by hitting .297 with five home runs, and 19 RBIs. He was then slowed by a strained right hamstring which placed him on the DL for 15 games. After returning from his injury, Ludwick struggled with a .200 average during the month of June. He had a productive July, hitting .340, with six home runs and a league-leading 28 RBIs, landing him NL Player of the Month honors. This gave the Cardinals 3 out of the last 4 NL Player of the Month awards, coupled with Albert Pujols's awards in April and June. At the end of the 2009 season Ludwick finished batting .265 with 22 home runs and 97 RBIs. Ludwick is primarily a right fielder, but also gets playing time in left field and occasionally in center field.
During the 2010 offseason, Ludwick and the Cardinals were able to avoid arbitration, reaching an agreement on a one-year contract worth $5.45 million for 2010. Through mid-June, he batted .451 with runners in scoring position, second-best among all MLB players. Additionally, he batted .476 with 11 RBIs with runners in scoring position and two out. His strong performance with runners in scoring position lead to him being placed in the cleanup role on June 14 against the Seattle Mariners. The move paid off as he hit a 3-run home run in his first at bat, and went 2-for-4 in the game.
San Diego Padres.
Ludwick was traded to the San Diego Padres in a three team deal on July 31, 2010, which sent starting pitcher Jake Westbrook and minor leaguer Nick Greenwood to the Cardinals and Corey Kluber to the Indians.
Upon his first at-bat back in St. Louis, as a Padre, he received a standing ovation from the St. Louis crowd, and Ludwick tipped his cap to the crowd in return. 
His stats took a hit in 2011 due to lack of production at the Padres home field, Petco Park. At the end of his tenure as a Padre, Ludwick was hitting .238, but with 11 home runs and 64 runs batted in and 42 runs scored. He accounted for 25.3 percent of the Padres' runs. By comparison, Adrian Gonzalez accounted for 23.6 percent of the Padres' runs in 2010.
Pittsburgh Pirates.
In the final hour of the 2011 MLB non-waiver trading deadline on July 31, San Diego traded Ludwick to the Pittsburgh Pirates for a player to be named later.
Cincinnati Reds.
On January 16, 2012 Ludwick agreed to terms with the Cincinnati Reds on a 1-year contract worth $2.5M with an option for a 2nd year in 2013. After initially splitting the left field duties with Chris Heisey, he eventually ran away with getting most of the starts. In 125 games, he hit .275/.346/.531 with 26 HR and 80 RBI. Ludwick started all 5 postseason games in the NLDS against the Giants, going 6-18 with 3 HR and 4 RBI.
He declined his option on October 31, and became a free agent. He re-signed with the Reds to a two-year, $15 million deal with a mutual option for 2015 on December 10, 2012.
On Opening Day 2013, Ludwick tore cartilage in his right shoulder as well as dislocating it, requiring surgery. Ludwick was placed on the 60-day disabled list, and returned to the Reds on August 12. In 38 games, he hit .240/.293/.326 with 2 HR and 12 RBI. In the Wild Card game against the Pirates, Ludwick went 3-4 with 2 doubles in the loss.
Personal.
Ludwick and his wife, Joanie, reside in Georgetown, Texas, and have one son, Stetson Tyler. Ludwick has stated that he chose his son's name due to his affinity for Stetson hats.

<doc id="5942852" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5942852" title="Filled milk">
Filled milk

Filled milk is any milk, cream, or skim milk that has been reconstituted with fats, usually vegetable oils, from sources other than dairy cows. Pure evaporated filled milk is generally considered unsuitable for drinking because of its particular flavor, but is equivalent to unadulterated evaporated milk for baking and cooking purposes. Other filled milk products with substituted fat are used to make ice cream, sour cream, whipping cream, and half-and-half substitutes among other dairy products. Coconut oil filled milk became a popular cost-saving product sold throughout the United States in the early 20th century. Coconut oil could be cheaply imported, primarily from the Philippines (at the time under American rule), and this product was able to undercut the market for evaporated and condensed milk. At the time, liquid milk was not widely available or very popular because of the rarity of refrigeration and the problems of transportation and storage.
History and importance in American law.
In 1923, the United States Congress banned the interstate sale of filled milk "in imitation or semblance of milk, cream, or skimmed milk" via the "Filled Milk Act" of March 4, 1923 (c. 262, 42 Stat. 1486, , in response to intense lobbying by the dairy industry, attempting to protect its market against competition by cheaper foreign fat. Many states also passed bans or restrictions on the sale and production of filled milk products. The issue of filled milk came to the forefront in "United States v. Carolene Products Co." wherein Carolene Products Co. was indicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois for violation of the Act by the shipment in interstate commerce of certain packages of "Milnut," a compound of condensed skimmed milk and coconut oil made in imitation or semblance of condensed milk or cream. The indictment stated, in the words of the statute, that Milnut "is an adulterated article of food, injurious to the public health," and that it is not a prepared food product of the type excepted from the prohibition of the Act.
Subsequently, most states have eliminated restrictions on filled milk and several states have gone against the Supreme Court and struck down restrictions on filled milk. Even the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois that originally ruled that a rational basis supported the Filled Milk Act reversed their decision in "Milnot Co. v. Richardson", 350 F.Supp. 221 (S.D. Ill. 1972). Further, the United States Department of Agriculture has broadly refused to consider filled milk products to be "in imitation or semblance of milk" and therefore has declined to see them as within the statute. The Milnot Company, which still exists, in this case was a descendant of the original Carolene Products Company discussed above. Currently, filled milk continues to be widely available in supermarkets in the United States as "Milnot", a brand now owned by The J.M. Smucker Company.

Ayano-Maysky District

Ayano-Maysky District () is an administrative and municipal district (raion), one of the seventeen in Khabarovsk Krai, Russia. It is located in the north of the krai. The area of the district is . Its administrative center is the rural locality (a "selo") of Ayan. Population: The population of Ayan accounts for 42.2% of the district's total population.
Geography.
The district has two climatic zones: a sharply continental and a maritime continental. The villages of Aim, Dzhigda, and Nelkan are located in the former, and Ayan belongs to the latter. Areas along the coast receive much precipitation and have a frequent share of cloudy days, storm winds, and blizzards. Average winter temperatures range from to ; average summer temperatures—from to .
The impact of the Sea of Okhotsk on the coastal region is constant and as it moves west inland toward the Dzhugdzhur mountain range and becomes weaker the impact creates a climatic subzone, transforming the maritime climate into a sharply continental one. The ridge of the Dzhugdzhur Mountains demarcates the border between two climates.
A unique orographic feature of the region is the circular, crater-like Kondyor Massif.
In the sharply continental zone, which gets very little precipitation and is humidity free, average winter and summer temperatures vary from and from respectively.
History.
In the 17th century, shortly after the establishment of Yakutsk, the exploration of what is now Ayano-Maysky District pursued two goals. Yakutsk officials through eastward expansion sought to come up with new sources of tribute for the Tsar's treasury while at the same time trying to find a shorter, more convenient passage to the Sea of Okhotsk, in order to continue to care for the needs of rich Russian colonies in the Far East and North America.
In 1639, a group of Russian explorers under the leadership of Ivan Moskvitin reached the Sea of Okhotsk for the first time through the territory of modern Ayano-Maysky District.
In the first half of the 19th century, the Russian-American Company became the first trading company in the region, with its merchant office located in the port of Okhotsk. In 1842, the Company decided to find a better, more advantageous spot for a seaport. Consequently, in 1845 the Russian-American Company's merchant office was moved to Ayan.
Ayan's prosperity, however, was not to last. After the Alaska Purchase, life was virtually brought to a standstill. By 1867, the Russian-American Company was no longer in business. Many local businessmen and professionals joined the exodus of merchants who had discontinued their operations in the area. A recently (1850s) built and much more conveniently located Nikolayevsk-on-Amur became Russia's new main port in the Sea of Okhotsk region.
In the Russian Civil War, the territory of modern Ayano-Maysky District was the scene of the anti-Soviet Yakut Revolt. It was the last enclave of the White Forces, where General Anatoly Pepelyayev did not capitulate until June 17, 1923.
By decree of the Soviet government, Ayano-Maysky District was officially formed on December 10, 1930 by combining the areas of Ayan and Nelkan. Ayan was assigned the role of being the administrative center. In the 1930s, the Soviet government began forming state and collective farms, opened local schools and hospitals, amateur musical clubs, and otherwise encouraged the Evenks to switch from their nomadic lifestyle to a settled way of life.
In 1936, the first local farmers' market was opened with hopes of bringing locals together. State farm workers and private small farm owners sold their meat, wild game, fish, berries, mushrooms, etc.
People who made the decision to make this region their temporary home received added governmental bonuses to their pay and an earlier retirement age: for men when they reached 55 and women at 50.
With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, however, some state farms and enterprises were disbanded and government subsidies discontinued, forcing many residents to move out of the settlements to bigger cities or other regions of Russia.

Just Wanna Dance

"Just Wanna Dance" is a single by American singer La Toya Jackson. It is taken from her EP "Startin' Over" released in 2011. It peaked at #13 on the US "Billboard" Hot Dance Club Play chart, making it her highest charting single.
Song information.
After six years in seclusion after escaping an abusive relationship with late former husband and manager Jack Gordon, La Toya Jackson returned to the studio to record an autobiographical album entitled "Startin' Over". "Just Wanna Dance" was recorded in 2002, but it wasn't until 2004 that it was released as "Startin' Over's" lead single.
Jackson began work on the song by visiting night clubs to hear what sort of music people were dancing to. To accomplish this, Jackson disguised herself as a male alter-ego named "Toy." As a result, the song's sexually ambiguous lyrics describe a ribald night out at a club where the party-goers "don’t know if I’m a he or a she".
The single was initially released under Jackson's nickname Toy, so disc jockeys would give the record a fair chance before tossing it aside. To Jackson's satisfaction, the strategy worked. Jackson phoned DJs who had played her track to reveal "Toy's" true identity saying, “One phone call at a time, I am letting them know all about Toy. While some of them knew that Toy was me, others were surprised. The overall response has been rewarding and encouraging.” 
The single includes mixes by Vibelicious and Jason Randolph. About.com praised Randolph's "Extended Vocal" mix saying it had a "a running synth line that could move anyone to the dancefloor." Jackson's vocals were complimented as "suitthe sing-songy verses quite well." "Outword Magazine" called the track "energetic" and "infectious".
Although the single reached the #13 position on the United States dance chart in October 2004, a commercial release never followed, mostly because Jackson's record company, Ja-Tail Records, had not yet secured a distribution deal. A follow-up single, "Free the World", was released 5 months later. On the back of the singles' success, Ja-Tail obtained a distribution deal with Universal-Bungalo Records. A music video was reportedly planned, but during rehearsals Jackson's toe was broken when a microphone fell on it.
Jackson performed "Just Wanna Dance" for the first time on the grand finale of Mexican reality TV series "La Academia" on 18 December 2011.

John Paddock

Alvin John Paddock (born June 9, 1954) is a Canadian professional ice hockey coach and former player. He is a former head coach of the Winnipeg Jets and Ottawa Senators. During his long career in the American Hockey League he won five Calder Cup championships (two as a player, three as a head coach) and was inducted into the AHL's Hall of Fame in 2010.
Playing career.
Selected in the 1974 NHL Entry Draft by the Washington Capitals, Paddock only played 8 games with the Capitals before he was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers. He played a memorable role in the 1980 Stanley Cup Finals, scoring the tying goal to send game 6 of the Finals into overtime. Unfortunately for the Flyers, Bob Nystrom scored at 7:11 of overtime to win the Stanley Cup.
Throughout his career he had a difficult time trying to crack the lineup on an NHL team. Playing primarily in the minors, in particular the Maine Mariners, Paddock retired as a player in 1983–84 and moved to the coaching side.
Coaching career.
Paddock began coaching with the Maine Mariners of the American Hockey League. He later coached in Hershey, Pennsylvania, winning the Calder Cup as coach of the 1988 AHL champion Hershey Bears. He was named head coach of the Winnipeg Jets in 1991, becoming the first Manitoba-born coach of the franchise. Later he would also become general manager of the Jets, and would relinquish his coaching duties in early 1994. He remained as the general manager, even after the Jets relocated to Phoenix, until December 1996.
After two years as a scout with the New York Rangers, Paddock would return to head coaching in 1999, primarily in the AHL. He was head coach of the Hartford Wolf Pack from 1999–2002, winning his second AHL Championship in the 1999–2000 season. 
Paddock joined the Ottawa Senators organization in 2002 as coach of the AHL Binghamton Senators from 2002–2005. In 2002, he was promoted to the assistant coach of the Ottawa Senators. When Ottawa head coach Bryan Murray was promoted to general manager in July 2007, Paddock became head coach of Ottawa, the sixth head coach in modern Senators' history. 
Paddock's term with Ottawa started extremely well. In the first 17 games of the season, the club set records for the best start in NHL history, winning 15 of their first 17 games. In the 2007–08 season, Paddock was the head coach of the Eastern Conference team for the All-Star game as Ottawa had the best record in the East.
However it was not to last. On February 27, 2008, Murray fired Paddock after several lackluster performances by the team in February, and a generally poor record since the first 17 games of the year. Murray would serve as head coach for the remainder of the 2007–08 season and playoffs, with a 7-9-2 record. The Senators were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs.
Paddock did not stay out of work for long. In August 2008, Paddock returned to the Philadelphia Flyers organization. He was hired to be head coach to their AHL team the Philadelphia Phantoms, returning Paddock to the league where he has had his most success. On July 9, 2009, he was appointed assistant General Manager of the Flyers.
On June 18th, 2014. Paddock was released by the Philadelphia Flyers organization.

Belinga

Belinga is a location in Gabon with as yet unexploited iron ore deposits. These ore deposits extend into neighbouring Cameroon and Congo.
Mining.
The Belinga iron reserves were discovered in 1895. They are estimated to hold about one billion tons of iron ore.
Iron ore mining was expected to start in 2011 but due to a lack of financing the project is currently on hold.
Because of slowness in getting the project started, the Chinese rights may be in 2012 given to Australia's BHP Billiton. 
Transport.
A 237km long railway branch line is proposed branching from Booue to enable these deposits to be exploited. As the tonneages hauled will be greatly increased, this line may also extend to a port at Santa Clara which would extend the railway to 560km.
The town is near the Republic of Congo border.

<doc id="5943030" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5943030" title="Zuiikin' English">
Zuiikin' English

"Zuiikin' English" or officially is a Japanese television series originally aired in 1992 by Fuji Television. Eikaiwa, Taisō and Zuiikin mean "English conversation", "gymnastic exercises" and "voluntary muscles", respectively. The series combines English language lessons with gymnastic exercise programs. The series consists of 24 episodes.
Background.
In 1987, Fuji Television, whose call sign is JOCX-TV, branded their late-night/early-morning slots collectively as JOCX-TV2 (meaning "alternative JOCX-TV") in an effort to market the traditionally unprofitable time slots and give opportunities to young creators to express their new ideas. The broadcaster produced numerous experimental programs on low budgets under this and follow-on brands until 1995. One such program tried to help viewers to fall asleep while another showed an actor reading out a well-known novel and nothing else. "Zuiikin' English" was born under these circumstances.
Format.
At the beginning of the show, the host and mastermind, Fernandez Verde, explains his philosophy in learning languages. He proclaims that different cultures use muscles in different proportions due to their customs. For example, in one episode he states Japanese people have stronger lower back muscles (from bowing and keeping a lower posture), and a different leg muscle structure (due to squatting for long periods of time). He feels that using those particular muscles while learning the language of that culture will create strong connotations in your mind and faster learning.
Then a sketch starts like an ordinary language lesson program. Every time a new English phrase is introduced, the sketch pauses and switches to the Zuiikin Gals, a threesome gymnastic exercise team. They perform synchronised exercises while smiling and chanting the phrase. The choice of phrases include the following:
In the final episode, three English native speakers formed the Zuiikin Boys and demonstrated gymnastic movements while chanting supposedly useful Japanese phrases. One such phrase, "tsumaranai mono desuga" (つまらない物ですが) ends up translating rather roughly to "please accept this trifling thing". No translations are provided during these Japanese lessons as they are for the English lessons, only Japanese characters and romanisations.
Initial broadcasting in Japan.
The program was initially broadcast in the spring of 1992. It occupied an early-morning slot around 5 AM. This allocation itself was probably a move to perfect the parody because the long-running gymnastic exercise program by national station NHK was also broadcast in early mornings (around 6 AM). This early broadcast time was one of the main reasons why the series passed unnoticed to most people in Japan.
International minor cult.
It wasn't until the broadcaster decided to rerun the series from November 2005 on their satellite channels that the program, and especially the Zuiikin Gals, started to attract international attention. One of the clips uploaded on YouTube has been viewed more than a half-million times (as of October 2006). Clips from the show have been featured on radio and TV programs such as "The Opie and Anthony Show","The Soup", "Anderson Cooper 360", "Upload with Shaquille O'Neal" and "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" in America, and "Rude Tube" and "8 out of 10 Cats" in England.
The Zuiikin Gals are Maiko Miyazawa (宮沢麻衣子), Reiko Saito (斎藤レイ子) and Takako Inayoshi (稻吉貴子), whose names are displayed at the beginning of each exercise. Inayoshi is still active in the entertainment business as an actress.

<doc id="5943044" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5943044" title="Survivor Series (1987)">
Survivor Series (1987)

Survivor Series (1987) was the first Survivor Series pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It took place on Thanksgiving Day, November 26, 1987 and was held at the Richfield Coliseum in Richfield Township, Ohio.
The main event was a Survivor Series match where André the Giant's team defeated Hulk Hogan's team when André eliminated Hogan's team member Bam Bam Bigelow to become the first lone survivor in the history of the Survivor Series. The entire undercard featured Survivor Series matches which included Randy Savage's team defeating The Honky Tonk Man's team and The Fabulous Moolah's team defeating Sensational Sherri's team. The event also featured a 10 tag team elimination match in which Strike Force and their teammates defeated The Hart Foundation's team.
Development.
The event was added after WrestleMania III, to market the success from Hulk Hogan and André the Giant's rivalry. Vince McMahon threatened cable companies who aired the NWA's Starrcade (which was going head-to-head with Survivor Series on Thanksgiving night, 1987) instead of Survivor Series would not be allowed to broadcast WrestleMania IV. Most cable providers gave into McMahon's threat and only a handful aired Starrcade.
Background.
The main feud heading into Survivor Series included André the Giant, One Man Gang, King Kong Bundy, Butch Reed and Rick Rude against Hulk Hogan, Paul Orndorff, Don Muraco, Ken Patera and Bam Bam Bigelow. In January 1987, Hogan was awarded a trophy for his third year as WWF Champion while Hogan's best friend André was awarded a smaller trophy than Hogan's, for being undefeated in WWF for 15 years. Hogan congratulated his friend and said that André was the real champion of superstars all around the world. André surprisingly left the place before Hogan could even finish. In February, he came with a new manager Bobby Heenan. When Hogan came to know about that, he begged André not to keep Heenan as his manager because Heenan was Hogan's longtime enemy. André said that he had come to challenge Hogan for the WWF title at WrestleMania. He ripped off Hogan's Hulkamania shirt and golden chain, turning heel. This culminated in their historic match at WrestleMania III, where Hogan defeated André to retain the title. During the match, he set a record by scoop slamming the 520-pound Frenchman. On August 22, 1987 edition of "Prime Time Wrestling", Paul Orndorff fired Bobby Heenan as his manager when he came to know that Heenan had brought in a new wrestler Rick Rude to replace Orndorff. Orndorff appointed Oliver Humperdink as his manager to feud with Rude. Billy Graham got involved in a feud with Butch Reed, culminating in a match between the duo. One Man Gang interfered in a match where he hit Graham with a big splash on the concrete floor. Don Muraco came to the rescue of Graham and Graham who was scheduled to participate in the main event of the first-ever Survivor Series retired due to an attack by One Man Gang. Muraco replaced him. Ken Patera got involved in a feud with Bobby Heenan and The Heenan Family and turned babyface, and was chosen to be the fourth member on Hogan's team. Many heel managers wanted to manage Bam Bam Bigelow, but Bigelow chose Oliver Humperdink as his manager thus making his WWF debut as a babyface. He also became a part of Hogan's team.
Randy Savage had been a heel since his WWF debut in the summer of 1985. He turned babyface in late 1987, after WWF Intercontinental Champion The Honky Tonk Man claimed to be the greatest Intercontinental Champion. This led to a feud between Savage and Honky, leading to Savage's face turn. On October 3, 1987 edition of "Saturday Night's Main Event", Savage challenged Honky for the title winning by disqualification. The title remained with Honky because a title cannot change hands by a DQ. Harley Race had won the 1986 King of the Ring tournament and was so proud about this that he called himself King Harley Race and wore a crown and cape to the ring. Jim Duggan did not agree with the fact and this placed Duggan and Race into a feud, with Duggan winning most of the matches. Jake Roberts also feuded with Honky Tonk Man after Honky hit a guitar on Roberts on an edition of "Snake Pit", completing Roberts' babyface turn. A match was booked for Survivor Series featuring Savage, Roberts, Ricky Steamboat (whom Honky Tonk had defeated to win the Intercontinental title), Brutus Beefcake and Duggan against Honky, Hercules, Danny Davis, Ron Bass and Race.
The major ongoing tag team feud pitted the face Strike Force and the villainous Hart Foundation. Tito Santana and Rick Martel formed Strike Force in the summer of 1987 after Santana rescued Martel from a beating by The Islanders. Strike Force quickly became a top contender for the WWF Tag Team Championship, held by the Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart), and on October 28, 1987, Strike Force won the titles when Neidhart was trapped in Martel's Boston crab.
Event.
The first match of the first-ever Survivor Series was the first-ever Survivor Series elimination match. Randy Savage, Jake Roberts, Ricky Steamboat, Brutus Beefcake and Jim Duggan faced WWF Intercontinental Champion The Honky Tonk Man, Hercules, Danny Davis, Ron Bass and Harley Race. Savage's team was seconded by his wife Miss Elizabeth while Honky's team was seconded by Bobby Heenan and Jimmy Hart. Beefcake and Hercules started off before Duggan and Race were tagged in. Duggan knocked Race out of the ring and followed him out where they brawled and both men were counted out and eliminated, leaving 4 men on each team. Beefcake hit a high knee on Bass, and went on to eliminate him as Savage's team had 4 men while Honky's team had 3 men. Team captain Honky himself joined the match and hit his Shake, Rattle and Roll on Beefcake and eliminated him, evening the match at 3–3. Roberts hit a DDT on Davis and only 2 men remained in Honky's team, Honky and Hercules while Savage's team was still having 3 men. Savage hit the Savage Elbow on Hercules and pinned him, leaving Honky the only member in his team. After being dominated by Savage, Roberts and Steamboat for a couple of minutes, Honky was atomic dropped over the top rope by Savage and ran from the ring with Jimmy Hart and his IC Belt and was counted out. Honky's self-elimination made Savage, Roberts and Steamboat the survivors of the match.
The next match was a women's match featuring the team of The Fabulous Moolah, Rockin' Robin, Velvet McIntyre and The Jumping Bomb Angels (Itsuki Yamazaki and Noriyo Tateno) against WWF Women's Champion Sensational Sherri, WWF Women's Tag Team Champions The Glamour Girls (Leilani Kai and Judy Martin), Donna Christanello and Dawn Marie. McIntyre did the first elimination by pinning Christanello with a victory roll. Robin hit a running crossbody on Marie and pinned her with the crossbody, leading to three wrestlers on Sherri's team while none of Moolah's team members had been eliminated. Team captain Sherri came into the match and hit Robin with a vertical suplex to eliminate her. Glamour Girls hit a double clothesline on Moolah and Judy Martin, one half of Glamour Girls pinned Moolah to eliminate her. McIntyre pinned Sherri with a victory roll pin, with Moolah's team having 3 members and Sherri's team having Glamour Girls, only 2 members. Leilani Kai joined the match and then pinned McIntyre after an electric chair drop. Yamazaki hit a diving crossbody from the top rope on Kai and pinned her to eliminate her. Tateno hit a flying clothesline on Martin and pinned her to win the match. Jumping Bomb Angels became the sole survivors for Moolah's team.
The third match was a tag team variation of the Survivor Series match with 10 tag teams. If a person from a tag team was eliminated, their partner was also eliminated. The match featured WWF Tag Team Champions Strike Force (Tito Santana and Rick Martel), The Young Stallions (Paul Roma and Jim Powers), The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques and Raymond), The Killer Bees (Jim Brunzell and Brian Blair) and The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid) against The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart), The Islanders (Haku and Tama), Demolition (Ax and Smash), The Bolsheviks (Nikolai Volkoff and Boris Zhukov) and The New Dream Team (Greg Valentine and Dino Bravo). Santana hit a flying forearm smash on Zhukov and pinned him to eliminate Bolsheviks for the first elimination of the match. Jacques hit a diving crossbody on Ax but missed the move and was pinned by Ax, eliminating Fabulous Rougeaus. Ax's partner Smash was disqualified, eliminating Demolition. Neidhart pinned Santana to eliminate Strike Force and Haku pinned Dynamite Kid to eliminate British Bulldogs. Next came Roma and Valentine. Roma hit a diving sunset flip on Valentine to eliminate The New Dream Team. Bret Hart and Jim Brunzell were next. Tama dropkicked Hart and then Brunzell rolled over Hart to eliminate Hart Foundation. The referee gave his attention to the Harts, who had been eliminated. Brian Blair put on his Killer Bees mask and pinned Tama with a sunset flip to eliminate Islanders. As a results, Young Stallions and Killer Bees won the match and became survivors for their team.
The main event was a Survivor Series match where André the Giant, One Man Gang, King Kong Bundy, Butch Reed and Rick Rude faced WWF Champion Hulk Hogan, Paul Orndorff, Don Muraco, Ken Patera and Bam Bam Bigelow. Muraco was not scheduled to compete in the match but replaced Billy Graham, who was originally scheduled to be Hogan's teammate but retired because of his hip injury suffered during a match against Reed. Hogan eliminated Reed after he hit a leg drop on Reed and pinned him to eliminate him first. Patera was eliminated after falling victim to One Man Gang's 747 Splash. Thereafter, Orndorff (who had recently turned face) and Rude began brawling to advance their feud over who had the better physique; Orndorff gotten the best of Rude until Bundy distracted him, allowing Rude to use a roll up to score the pin. Muraco (who had also recently turned face) joined the match and powerslammed Rude to eliminate him. One Man Gang entered and then hit Muraco with a 747 Splash to eliminate him, giving André's team a 3–2 advantage. One Mang Gang and Bundy began dominating Bigelow, when André was tagged in to go for the kill. However, Bigelow ducked an André punch and tagged in Hogan. Hogan immediately began getting the better of André and was setting up for a running elbow smash, when he was pulled out of the ring by Bundy; Hogan fought off both heels but was kept out of the ring long enough to be counted out. Hogan re-entered the ring to argue with the referees, but ring announcer Howard Finkel informed the crowd that if Hogan did not leave the ring immediately, Andre's team would win the match automatically. Bigelow—the lone remaining member of Hogan's team—fended for himself, using a Slingshot to eliminate Bundy, then pinning One Man Gang after he missed a 747 Splash. Bigelow eventually fell victim to André, who hit a butterfly suplex to win the match. After the match, Hogan returned to the ring and attacked André, hitting him with his title belt and knocking him from the ring.
Aftermath.
Hulk Hogan and André the Giant engaged in a war of words over the WWF Championship during the following months, with the feud taking on a new level when Ted DiBiase – whom was Hogan's primary challenger at the time – announced he planned to offer Hogan a cash buyout in exchange for the title, which Hogan emphatically refused. With fan anticipation of a Hogan-André rematch, André sneak attacked Hogan on "Saturday Night's Main Event", choking the champion until he was virtually unconscious, and shortly thereafter, DiBiase announced his alignment with André to help him win the championship. At the first Royal Rumble supercard on January 24, 1988, Hogan and André signed a contract for a WrestleMania III rematch. Their WWF title rematch took place on the first-ever edition of "The Main Event" on February 5, 1988 where André controversially defeated Hogan for the WWF Championship. However, his reign was short lived. In fact, he was the shortest reigning WWF Champion in history as his reign lasted even less than a minute as he sold the title to DiBiase. WWF President Jack Tunney immediately vacated the title and it was defended in a 14-man tournament at WrestleMania IV, with the winner winning the vacant title. With help from former champion Hogan, Randy Savage defeated DiBiase in the finals of the tournament to win the vacant WWF Championship.
Savage continued to battle the Honky Tonk Man for the Intercontinental Championship, but was unsuccessful. Bigger things were ahead for Savage, however, as he would be entered in the championship tournament at WrestleMania IV, defeating DiBiase in the final match to win the title. Honky went on to a record-setting reign Intercontinental Championship reign, holding the title 454 consecutive days until the first SummerSlam, when he was pinned by the The Ultimate Warrior.
Tag Team Champions Strike Force continued to successfully defend against the Hart Foundation in their matches before beginning a feud with Demolition late in the winter of 1988.

Anthony Simmons (American football)

Anthony Lamont Simmons (born on June 20, 1976) is a former American college and professional football player who was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) for seven seasons. He played college football for Clemson University, and earned All-American honors. He was drafted in the first round of the 1998 NFL Draft, and he played professionally for the Seattle Seahawks, and briefly, the New Orleans Saints of the NFL.
Early years.
Simmons was born in Spartanburg, South Carolina. He attended Spartanburg High School, where he played for the Spartanburg Vikings high school football team and helped lead the Vikings to their first of three consecutive state championships.
College career.
Simmons attended Clemson University, and played for the Clemson Tigers football team. As a freshman in 1995, Simmons earned the starting job at inside linebacker after just five days of practice. He finished the season with 150 tackles, and became the first defensive player ever to be named UPI's national freshman of the year, and received first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) honors. As a sophomore, he set the Tigers' record for tackles in a season (178) en route to being named an All-American, and earning another first-team All-ACC selection.
Simmons became one of the premier players in the nation as a junior, and was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American. He led both Clemson and the ACC in tackles (158) and tackles for loss (25) en route to a third-consecutive first-team All-ACC selection. He also led the Tigers in quarterback sacks (8).
Professional career.
Simmons ran a 4.28 and a 4.34 forty-yard dash for scout Larry Greenlee. His speed was part of the reason Simmons was selected in the first round (15th overall) of the 1998 NFL Draft by the Seattle Seahawks. He led the Seahawks in tackles in 2000, 2001, and 2003. He was released by the Seahawks after the 2004 season and sat out 2005 due to injury. He then signed with the New Orleans Saints before the 2006 season but ended up retiring before the season started. He finished his career with 591 tackles (455 solo), 10 sacks, 34.5 tackles for loss, seven forced fumbles, one fumble recovery, 27 pass deflections, nine interceptions for 131 yards, and two touchdowns in just 87 games.

Survivor Series (1988)

Survivor Series (1988) was the second annual Survivor Series pay-per-view professional wrestling event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It took place on November 24, 1988 (Thanksgiving night in the United States) and was held at the Richfield Coliseum, in Richfield Township, Ohio.
The main event was a ten-man Survivor Series match between a team captained by The Mega Powers (Hulk Hogan and WWF Champion Randy Savage) and a team captained by The Twin Towers (Akeem and the Big Boss Man). Hogan and Savage were the sole "survivors" of the match. The undercard featured three Survivor Series matches between mid-card wrestlers.
Background.
The main feud heading into Survivor Series pitted The Mega Powers (Hulk Hogan and WWF Champion Randy Savage), Hercules, Koko B. Ware, and Hillbilly Jim against The Twin Towers (Akeem and the Big Boss Man), Ted DiBiase, Haku, and The Red Rooster. Hogan and Savage formed this alliance at WrestleMania IV in March 1988 after Hogan helped Savage in defeating DiBiase in the tournament final for the vacant WWF Championship. DiBiase and André the Giant faced Hogan and Savage at the inaugural SummerSlam in August where the Mega Powers won. DiBiase had bought the contract of André from Heenan at the inaugural Royal Rumble in January. In late 1988, DiBiase bought another contract from Heenan, that of Hercules, who was a powerful force in the WWF. Hercules refused to become DiBiase's slave and turned babyface and started feuding with DiBiase. DiBiase and other heel wrestlers joined Twin Towers against Mega Powers and other babyface wrestlers.
Another major feud pitted Jake Roberts against André the Giant. The storyline began when Roberts exposed André's extreme fear of snakes on a recent edition of "Saturday Night's Main Event". Roberts had thrown his snake, Damien, on the frightened André, who suffered a mild (kayfabe) heart attack. André vowed revenge, but Roberts constantly used Damien—either in their matches or by coming to the ring with a sack containing the snake during André's matches against other wrestlers—to gain a psychological edge.
The major tag team feud pitted WWF Tag Team Champions Demolition against the Powers of Pain, two teams known for their use of face paint and power brawling style of wrestling. The other main feud pitted WWF Intercontinental Champion Ultimate Warrior vs. The Honky Tonk Man, the former champion who was determined to regain his title.
Event.
The first match of the event was a five-on-five Survivor Series match between the team of WWF Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior, Brutus Beefcake, Sam Houston, The Blue Blazer (in his pay-per-view (PPV) debut), and Jim Brunzell; and the team of The Honky Tonk Man, Ron Bass, Danny Davis, Greg Valentine, and Bad News Brown; as such, this match was mainly among Intercontinental Championship contenders, and low- to mid-card wrestlers. Don Muraco was originally scheduled to be a part of Warrior's team but left WWF, so he was replaced by Jim Brunzell. Beefcake scored the first victory of the night for Warrior's team, using a sleeper hold to force Davis to submit at the 1:18 mark. Brown evened the odds for the heel team about four minutes later, hitting Brunzell with a Ghetto Blaster, a type of kick to the back of the head. Not long thereafter, Valentine and Brown were setting Houston up for a double-team move when Houston dodged a running forearm club by Valentine, who instead struck Brown. Brown—playing up his character as an uncooperative loner—was angered and walked out of the match, getting himself counted out. Bass pinned Houston after a running powerslam, evening the sides at 3-apiece. The Blue Blazer used his speed to daze Valentine, but while attempting to finish the veteran Valentine off with a top-rope move, Honky ran over and pushed Blazer off the ropes; Valentine quickly applied a figure four leglock to force the submission. Beefcake then got the upper hand over Honky and locked on the sleeper hold, but Honky got to and slipped through the ropes, taking Beefcake with him; both men were ultimately counted out, leaving Warrior as the lone member of his team. Bass and Valentine worked over Warrior for a while, but Warrior dodged a double-clothesline attempt and knocked both men down, quickly pinning both men back-to-back—first Bass, then Valentine—with double axe handles to win the match and be the sole survivor.
The second Survivor Series match was a 10-on-10 variation of tag teams where if a wrestler from a tag team was eliminated, his partner was also eliminated. The match featured the Powers of Pain (The Warlord and The Barbarian), The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty), The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid), The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart), and The Young Stallions (Paul Roma and Jim Powers) against WWF Tag Team Champions Demolition (Ax and Smash), The Brain Busters (Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard), The Bolsheviks (Nikolai Volkoff and Boris Zhukov), The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques and Raymond Rougeau) and Los Conquistadores (Uno and Dos). Hart pinned Raymond with a small package, eliminating The Fabulous Rougeaus from the match. Zhukov hit a reverse diving crossbody on Powers and pinned him to eliminate The Young Stallions but shortly after, he was pinned by Jannetty with a sunset flip, thus eliminating The Bolsheviks from the match. Hart hit a German suplex on Blanchard but the referee saw his shoulders down, so he counted the pinfall eliminating The Hart Foundation. The Rockers began brawling with Blanchard and his partner Anderson. The Rockers and the Brain Busters were both disqualified due to brawling in the ring and were eliminated. Dynamite hit Smash on the mat and went to the top rope. He tried to hit a diving headbutt but Smash got up and clotheslined him and then pinned him to eliminate the British Bulldogs. Smash was unable to handle the powerful Barbarian of the Powers of Pain. When Mr. Fuji thought that his team could not beat the Powers of Pain, he opened the rope causing Smash to fall from the ring and get counted out, thus eliminating Demolition. Afterward, Ax confronted Fuji but when Ax turned his back, Fuji struck him with his cane. Demolition beat him and turned babyfaces. The Powers of Pain turned heels after they placed him in their corner. Moments later, the Barbarian hit Uno with a diving headbutt and pinned him to eliminate Los Conquistadores, making the Powers of Pain the sole survivors. After the match, Demolition ran back to the ring and ran Warlord and Barbarian from the ring.
The third Survivor Series match featured André the Giant, Rick Rude, Dino Bravo, Mr. Perfect, and Harley Race against Jim Duggan, Jake Roberts, Scott Casey, Ken Patera, and Tito Santana. Junkyard Dog was originally scheduled to be a part of Roberts' team but left WWF. B. Brian Blair replaced the Junkyard Dog to be a part of the team but he also left WWF, so he was replaced by Scott Casey. Rude hit Patera with a Rude Awakening at 8:18 mark and pinned Patera to eliminate him, leaving Roberts' team with 4 members. A minute later, André's team member Bravo hit Casey with a side suplex and pinned Casey to eliminate him. Roberts' team was left with only three members while André's team had still five members. However, Santana hit Race with a flying forearm smash and then pinned him to eliminate Race, leaving André's team with 4 members. Heel team captain André came in and quickly used his massive height and weight to crush and eventually pin Santana, leaving the heels with a 4–2 advantage. Later, Duggan used his 2×4 on Bravo, getting disqualified in the process. Roberts, the only member left on the face team, held his own and when Rude cockily attempted to tag one of his partners into the ring, he caught Rude from behind and hit with a DDT, eliminating him. André quickly got into the ring, applied a chokehold on Roberts and refused to release it, getting disqualified in the process. Before André left, he headbutted Roberts. Perfect took advantage and pinned Roberts to win the match. Perfect and Bravo became the sole survivors for their team. After the match, Roberts recovered, retrieved Damien and chased Andre, Perfect and Bravo from ringside.
The main event featured The Mega Powers (Hulk Hogan and WWF Champion Randy Savage), Hercules, Koko B. Ware, and Hillbilly Jim against The Twin Towers (Akeem and the Big Boss Man), Ted DiBiase, Haku, and The Red Rooster. Savage hit a Savage Elbow on Rooster to pin and eliminate him, giving the Mega Powers an early edge. The big Akeem quickly evened the two sides after overpowering Hillbilly Jim and striking him with the Air Africa splash for the pin. Akeem's partner Boss Man hit Koko with a Boss Man Slam to give the Twin Towers a 4-3 advantage. DiBiase's bodyguard Virgil distracted Hercules, allowing DiBiase to pin him with a schoolboy, leaving just team captains Hogan and Savage in the Mega Powers' corner. As DiBiase was taunting Hercules, Savage immediately pinned him with a schoolboy to eliminate him, leaving three members in Twin Towers' corner. Shortly thereafter, Slick (the manager of the Twin Towers) grabbed Elizabeth and—while pulling her away from ringside—began screaming threats at her, prompting Hogan to come to her rescue; Akeem and Boss Man intervened, hitting Hogan before Boss Man handcuffed Hogan to the ropes. In the process, Boss Man (the legal man in the ring) was counted out while Akeem was disqualified for shoving the referee and illegally double-teaming Savage. Haku, left as the only member of the heel team, dominated Savage for several minutes as Slick (who remained at ringside) taunted both Hogan and Elizabeth. Eventually, Haku accidentally kicked Slick from the ring apron (after a mistimed illegal double team on Savage) while Hogan clotheslined Heenan. After Elizabeth grabbed the key to unlock his handcuffs, Hogan was tagged into the match after Haku kicked an exhausted Savage into his corner. Hogan quickly dominated Haku and pinned him with a leg drop to score the win for the Mega Powers. After the match, Hogan began acting friendly toward Elizabeth, clearly upsetting Savage, whose reaction was known to the crowd and television audience but not acknowledged by Hogan; pro-heel color commentator Jesse Ventura also picked up on this and interviewed him later about the incident.
Aftermath.
The Mega Powers were a powerful tag team throughout 1988 but their domination began to end as misunderstanding occurred between Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage in early 1989. This all began on January 7, 1989 edition of "Saturday Night's Main Event", Hogan was mercilessly beaten by The Twin Towers after his match with Akeem. Savage came out and cleared the ring with a steel chair. Elizabeth took Hogan to the backstage area which angered Savage. He thought that he was a third wheel and this was the beginning of the breakup of Mega Powers as Savage was angry as to why his wife Miss Elizabeth was used by Hogan as his manager. He confronted her about the issue but she took Hogan backstage. Problems increased further in the Royal Rumble match where Hogan accidentally eliminated Savage as he was trying to eliminate Bad News Brown. On February 3 edition of "The Main Event", Hogan and Savage faced The Twin Towers (Akeem and the Big Boss Man) in a tag team match, filled with controversy. During the climax of the match, Akeem threw Savage on top of Elizabeth, knocking her out cold. Hogan picked her up and took her backstage, leaving Savage alone to face the Towers while Hogan tended to Elizabeth. When Hogan came back, Savage slapped him in the face and took the belt in his hand and turned heel by abandoning Hogan. Though, Hogan managed to pick up the win. Mega Powers disbanded as Hogan and Savage feuded with each other. At WrestleMania V, Hogan defeated Savage in a match what was billed "The Mega Powers Explode" to win the WWF Championship ending Savage's reign of 371 days.
The feud between Demolition and the Powers of Pain took on its new twist, as now Demolition was the face team and the Powers of Pain were the villains. Mr. Fuji constantly interfered in his team's matches against Demolition, and eventually, a 2-on-3 match was signed for WrestleMania V, with Fuji joining the Powers of Pain. At WrestleMania, Demolition was able to gain their final revenge on Fuji when—after his mistimed attempt to throw salt in Smash's eyes—he was caught in Demolition's finishing move, the Demolition Decapitation.
The other feud that continued to headline was Jake "the Snake" Roberts vs. André the Giant, who continued to feud until WrestleMania V, by which time the returning Big John Studd (now competing as a face) had involved himself in the feud by being the guest referee for the André-Roberts match. Prior to that, at the 1989 Royal Rumble, André immediately attacked Roberts when the latter entered the ring during the main event, choking Roberts to the brink of unconsciousness before throwing him out; Roberts recovered within 10 minutes, retrieved his snake, Damien, and scared André from the ring.
Following Survivor Series, "Ravishing" Rick Rude began targeting the Ultimate Warrior for his Intercontinental Championship, badgering him into a posedown at the Royal Rumble. The Honky Tonk Man, meanwhile, continued to be unsuccessful against the Warrior (in a bid to regain the title) and, shortly after their last match aired on "Saturday Night's Main Event", began losing his push and was demoted to mid-card matches.
For The British Bulldogs, this was their last appearance in the WWF as a tag team; the Dynamite Kid was gone for good, while Davey Boy Smith would return in 1991 as a singles competitor known as "The British Bulldog." They left, in part, shortly after a series of practical jokes and altercations with The Rougeau Brothers got out of hand, culminating in Jacques Rougeau knocking several of Dynamite's teeth out with a sucker punch shortly before Survivor Series.

Survivor Series (1989)

Survivor Series (1989) was the third annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It took place on Thanksgiving Day, November 23, 1989 at the Rosemont Horizon in Rosemont, Illinois. This was the first Survivor Series event to feature team names and to feature four-on-four tag matches instead of five-on-five.
The main event was a four-on-four Survivor Series match where The Ultimate Warriors (WWF Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior, The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) and Jim Neidhart) defeated The Heenan Family (Bobby Heenan, Colossal Connection (André the Giant and Haku) and Arn Anderson). The undercard also featured Survivor Series matches.
Background.
Survivor Series featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing feuds, plots, and storylines that were played out on WWE's primary television programs. Wrestlers portrayed villains or heroes as they followed a series of events that built tension and culminated in one of the Survivor Series matches.
The main feud heading into Survivor Series was between The Ultimate Warriors (WWF Intercontinental Champion Ultimate Warrior, The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) and Jim Neidhart) and The Heenan Family (Colossal Connection (André the Giant and Haku) and Brain Busters (Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard)). Bobby Heenan was a very popular heel manager, who led many heel wrestlers to championship victories in the WWF and his clients feuded with all babyface wrestlers. Ultimate Warrior had been placed in a feud with Heenan's client Rick Rude which began at Royal Rumble when Warrior won by fan reaction over Rude in a posedown. Rude followed by attacking him. They feuded with each other until the summer of the year, in which they exchanged the Intercontinental Championship with each other. The Rockers were in a feud with Brain Busters, that had also begun since the beginning of the year. The feud began on January 30, 1989 edition of "Prime Time Wrestling" where The Brain Busters faced The Rockers. In the match, The Brain Busters narrowly defeated the Rockers as Anderson held down Marty Jannetty's leg as Blanchard pinned him. The Rockers and The Brain Busters faced each other in a rematch on March 11 edition of "Saturday Night's Main Event" which resulted in a double countout. They were added to the main event of Survivor Series in opposing teams.
The Honky Tonk Man began a feud with Dusty Rhodes in mid-1989, which culminated at SummerSlam where Dusty won. Rhodes and Honky continued their rivalry with each other, leading to a match at Survivor Series. Rhodes was scheduled to captain Dream Team while Honky became a part of The Enforcers. Akeem, one half of The Twin Towers defeated Brutus Beefcake in a King of the Ring tournament qualifying match on October 14, leading to a feud between Beefcake and the Twin Towers. Beefcake joined Dusty's Dream Team while Twin Towers became scheduled captains of Enforcers. Tito Santana and Rick Martel, former Strike Force teammates had been feuding with each other since WrestleMania V, where Martel turned heel by abandoning Santana during their match against Brain Busters (Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard). At SummerSlam, Martel and The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques and Raymond Rougeau) defeated Santana and The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty). Martel became a member of The Enforcers while Santana and The Red Rooster were added to The Dream Team.
Randy Savage turned heel in early 1989, breaking up The Mega Powers. He defeated Jim Duggan later that same year to win the title of "King of Wrestling", beginning a feud between Duggan and himself. Greg Valentine and Ronnie Garvin had been feuding since a match on December 30, 1988 in Madison Square Garden (MSG) which Valentine won by grabbing the tights for leverage. On April 22, 1989 episode of "Superstars", Garvin defeated Valentine in a match. On the following edition of "Superstars", they both faced each other in a retirement match where the loser could not wrestle anymore in WWF. Valentine won the match, sending Garvin into retirement. Garvin became a referee for the WWF. During this time, he punched several wrestlers who physically provoked him, including Valentine in the course of his match against Jimmy Snuka, and he was suspended after the match. Valentine was also involved in a feud with Hercules, which culminated at SummerSlam where Valentine defeated Hercules by pinning him using the ropes for leverage. Garvin was the guest ring announcer for the match, and not only did he verbally shot Valentine during the introduction, but he also announced Hercules as the winner by disqualification. Valentine was so irate that he demanded for Garvin to be re-instated as a professional wrestler and his request was accepted. Garvin and Hercules were included as members of 4x4s at Survivor Series and Valentine was added as a member of King's Court. Dino Bravo was involved in a feud with Bret Hart. At Royal Rumble, Jim Duggan, Hart and Jim Neidhart defeated Bravo and The Fabulous Rougeaus in a two out of three falls match, so Bravo became a member of King's Court at Survivor Series and Hart became a member of 4x4s.
Hulk Hogan starred in a WWF financed professional wrestling movie "No Holds Barred" as the protagonist, Rip. Tom Lister, Jr. portrayed Rip's arch rival Zeus in the movie, who is defeated by Rip. It turned out into a rivalry that took place in the WWF. Lister was billed as Zeus, who wanted to take revenge of the movie from Hogan in real-life. He debuted on May 27, 1989 edition of "Saturday Night's Main Event" before Hogan's WWF Championship title defense against Big Boss Man in a steel cage. Boss Man's manager Slick introduced him. Zeus attacked Hogan during Hogan's entrance. The feud culminated at SummerSlam where Hogan and Brutus Beefcake defeated Randy Savage and Zeus. Zeus was scheduled to become a part of Million $ Team against Hogan's Hulkamaniacs team at Survivor Series. At WrestleMania V, Ted DiBiase attempted to steal Jake Roberts' snake Damien during Roberts' match against André the Giant beginning a rivalry between Roberts and DiBiase. Roberts defeated DiBiase's manager Virgil on "Superstars" but after the match, DiBiase injured him and sidelined him for months. Roberts returned in late 1989 and signed to become a part of Hogan's Hulkamaniacs team against DiBiase's Million $ Team. Demolition (Ax and Smash) were pushed as a heel tag team in the WWF in 1988 under the tutelage of Mr. Fuji. A stronger and powerful babyface tag team Powers of Pain (The Warlord and The Barbarian) debuted in the summer of 1988 and challenged Demolition for the WWF Tag Team Championship. At Survivor Series, Fuji caused Demolition to get eliminated in a Survivor Series match resulting in a double turn as Powers of Pain turned heels and Demolition turned babyfaces. At WrestleMania V, Demolition defeated Powers of Pain and Mr. Fuji in a handicap match to retain the tag titles, culminating in Demolition joining Hulkamaniacs at Survivor Series and Powers of Pain joining Million $ Team in Survivor Series.
At SummerSlam, Roddy Piper interfered in Rick Rude's WWF Intercontinental Championship title defense against Ultimate Warrior and distracted Rude, causing Rude to lose the title to Warrior. This led to Rude and Piper captaining teams against each other at Survivor Series. Rude's team was dubbed "Rude Brood" and Piper's team was dubbed "Roddy's Rowdies". Jimmy Snuka became a part of Rowdy's Rowdies and Mr. Perfect became a part of Rude Brood. The Bushwhackers (Butch and Luke) feuded with The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques and Raymond Rougeau) in early 1989. This led to their WrestleMania V encounter where Bushwhackers won, leading to Bushwhackers joining Roddy's Rowdies and Rougeaus joining Rude Brood.
Event.
Before the event aired live on pay-per-view, Boris Zhukov defeated Paul Roma in a dark match. The first Survivor Series match that aired on pay-per-view was the first-ever Survivor Series match to feature team names and the first to have four participants in each team. It was between The Dream Team (Dusty Rhodes, Brutus Beefcake, The Red Rooster and Tito Santana) and The Enforcers (Big Boss Man, Bad News Brown, Rick Martel and The Honky Tonk Man). Originally, Boss Man's tag team The Twin Towers partner Akeem was scheduled to be a part of The Enforcers but was replaced by Brown. Rick Martel and Tito Santana, two former Strike Force partners and current rivals began the match. Martel pinned Santana with a roll-up, eliminating Santana, leaving Dream Team with three members. Sapphire made her debut in the audience cheering on Dusty Rhodes. Like the previous year, Bad News Brown walked out on his team after arguing with team captain Big Boss Man and getting counted-out. Enforcers had also three members. Now both teams were having equal members until Brutus Beefcake pinned Honky Tonk Man after a high knee, eliminating Honky and leaving Enforcers with only two members – Boss Man and Martel. Martel entered but failed to eliminate Beefcake. Instead, Beefcake pinned Martel with a roll-up, eliminating him and leaving Enforcers' captain Boss Man as the remaining member. He managed to pin Red Rooster after a Boss Man Slam. He fought the opposing Dream Team's captain Dusty Rhodes. The two captains had a battle with each other, which Rhodes won after he pinned Boss Man with a flying crossbody. Dream Team won with Rhodes and Beefcake as the sole survivors.
The second Survivor Series match was between The King's Court (Randy Savage, Canadian Earthquake, Dino Bravo and Greg Valentine) and 4x4s (Jim Duggan, Bret Hart, Ronnie Garvin and Hercules). Canadian Earthquake was a replacement for The Widowmaker. Hercules and Earthquake began the match. Earthquake hit Hercules an Earthquake Splash and pinned Hercules to eliminate him, leaving 4x4s with three members. Greg Valentine came next against the team captain of the 4x4s, Jim Duggan. Duggan used his bigger size on Valentine and hit him with a three-point stance charging clothesline and pinned Valentine to eliminate him, leaving King's Court with three members too. Dino Bravo brawled with Ronnie Garvin. Bravo hit Garvin a side slam and pinned Garvin to eliminate him, leaving 4x4s with two members – Duggan and Bret Hart. Hart used his high-flying ability but fell victim to a Savage Elbow by opposing team King's Court captain Randy Savage. Savage followed by pinning Hart and eliminating him, leaving 4x4s with their captain Duggan. Duggan was able to fend himself against King's Court, who were all three. However, Savage's valet Queen Sherri interfered which distracted Duggan. Duggan went to the outside to chase her and got counted out. King's Court won the match with Savage, Earthquake and Bravo as the sole survivors. After the match, Duggan grabbed his 2x4 and attacked Savage, Earthquake and Bravo with it.
The third Survivor Series match was between The Hulkamaniacs (WWF Champion Hulk Hogan, WWF Tag Team Champions Demolition (Ax and Smash) and Jake Roberts) and Million $ Team (Ted DiBiase, Powers of Pain (The Warlord and The Barbarian) and Zeus). Zeus shoved the referee at 3:21 minute mark, so he was disqualified and got eliminated, leaving Million $ Team with three members. Ax and Warlord battled each other. Ax dominated Warlord until Powers of Pain's manager Mr. Fuji distracted him. Warlord took advantage and pinned Ax to eliminate him, leaving Hulkamaniacs with three members to even the score. Ax's Demolition partner Smash entered the match and Warlord's Powers of Pain partner Barbarian battled it out. Smash tried to take revenge of Ax's elimination from Barbarian but was pinned after a flying clothesline, getting eliminated and leaving Hulkamaniacs with two members – Jake Roberts and Hulk Hogan himself. Warlord and Barbarian double-teamed Hogan, so they were disqualified and eliminated, leaving opposing team Million $ Team's captain Ted DiBiase as the only member from his team remaining in the match. Roberts got the upper hand on DiBiase until DiBiase's manager Virgil distracted Roberts. DiBiase pinned Roberts and put his feet on the ropes for leverage. Hulkamaniacs' captain Hogan was the remaining member of his team. Both captains were now left to battle against each other where Hogan hit a leg drop on DiBiase and pinned him to win the match and becoming the sole survivor for his team.
The fourth Survivor Series match was between The Rude Brood (Rick Rude, Mr. Perfect and The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques and Raymond Rougeau)) and Roddy's Rowdies (Roddy Piper, Jimmy Snuka and The Bushwhackers (Butch and Luke)). The high-flying Jimmy Snuka and Jacques Rougeau began the battle where Snuka hit Jacques with a Superfly Splash and pinned him to eliminate Jacques, leaving Rude Brood with three members. Jacques' brother and Fabulous Rougeaus partner Raymond battled opposing team Roddy's Rowdies' captain Roddy Piper. Piper hit Raymond with a piledriver and pinned Raymond to eliminate him, leaving Rude Brood with only two members – Mr. Perfect and the captain Rick Rude. Perfect had been pushed as an undefeated wrestler since joining WWF in 1988. He pinned Bushwhacker Butch with a roll-up to eliminate Butch, leaving Rowdy's Rowdies with 3 members. Butch's Bushwhackers partner Bushwhacker Luke battled Rude but unluckily, he was hit with a Rude Awakening and got pinned, getting eliminated and leaving Rowdy's Rowdies with two members. Both teams were having two members. Both captains, Rude and Piper battled each other and the captains themselves were counted-out, leaving it to Perfect from Rude Brood and Snuka from Roddy's Rowdies. Snuka used his high-flying techniques on Perfect but was unable to pin him. Perfect hit Snuka a Perfectplex and pinned him to win the match and becoming the sole survivor for Rude Brood.
The main event was a Survivor Series match between The Ultimate Warriors (WWF Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior, The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) and Jim Neidhart and The Heenan Family (manager Bobby Heenan, Colossal Connection (André the Giant and Haku) and Arn Anderson). Arn Anderson's Brain Busters partner Tully Blanchard was originally scheduled to be a part of The Heenan Family but he was fired from the WWF on the day of the pay-per-view for failing a drug test, so Bobby Heenan replaced him. At first, only Neidhart, Jannetty and Michaels were introduced for the face team, and as soon as the Rockers entered the ring, Neidhart attacked Heenan while Michaels and Jannetty went after Anderson and Haku. André went after the faces, attacking at will until Warrior ran out, jumped into the ring and, after sending him reeling with a series of clotheslines, knocked André to the floor. André was counted out at the 26-second mark, giving the Warrior's team a quick 4-3 advantage. Later, Neidhart and Anderson were brawling when, after Anderson was knocked to the floor, Haku snuck up from behind and struck Neidhart with a thrust kick to score the pin. Anderson and Haku used a series of double-team moves to wear down Janetty, and eventually Heenan was tagged in to score the easy pin and give the Heenan Family a 3-2 edge. After Haku missed with a flying crossbody, Michaels used a crossbody of his own to pin Haku. At this point, Anderson began showing signs of frustration with Heenan, but still was able to eliminate Michaels after hitting him with an Anderson Drop. Anderson held a short-lived advantage over Warrior, but the beginning of the end for the heels came when Warrior whipped Anderson into Heenan (who was standing on the apron), knocking the latter to the floor. Warrior pinned Anderson after hitting him with a gorilla press drop-big splash combination. As Heenan began regaining his senses and arguing with Anderson, thinking him to be walking out on the match, Warrior snuck around ringside and snuck up on Heenan, who realized what had happened. Warrior grabbed Heenan, whipped him across the ring and after knocking him down with a shoulder tackle, hit him with a big splash to score the pin and become the sole survivor for his team. Warrior, after briefly posing in the ring with his Intercontinental Championship belt, knocked down a groggy Heenan in the aisle, shortly before the pay-per-view signed off.
Aftermath.
The Ultimate Warrior was successful in the WWF's mid-card division in 1989, so he became a main eventer at Survivor Series. The biggest main event of his career was at WrestleMania VI where he defeated Hulk Hogan to win the WWF Championship in a title vs. title match where Warrior's WWF Intercontinental Championship was also on the line.
Andre the Giant and Haku had teamed together occasionally prior to the 1989 Survivor Series, but this was their first high-profile match as a tag team. After Survivor Series, the two formally formed a tag team known as The Colossal Connection, in part to fill a void in the Heenan Family left by the imminent departure of Anderson and Blanchard but also to prolong the ailing Andre's career – the effects of his real-life acromegaly were starting to take their toll – by featuring him in a team where the younger, healthy Haku would handle most of the wrestling. On December 13, 1989, Andre and Haku would win the WWF Tag Team Championship by defeating Demolition at a television taping in Huntsville, Alabama, and would hold on to the titles until Demolition gained revenge at WrestleMania VI, defeating Andre and Haku and setting in motion Andre's face turn.
The final confrontation between Hogan and Zeus was set up for a special late-December pay-per-view event called "No Holds Barred: The Movie and The Match", where actor Tiny Lister – in his "Zeus" character" – was paired with Randy Savage (his tag-team partner from the 1989 SummerSlam event) and Hogan and Brutus "the Barber" Beefcake were reunited for a special tag team steel cage match, with Hogan and Beefcake won.

Survivor Series (1990)

Survivor Series (1990) was the fourth annual Survivor Series pay-per-view professional wrestling event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It took place on Thanksgiving Day, November 22, 1990 at the Hartford Civic Center in Hartford, Connecticut.
This Survivor Series saw the on-screen WWF debut of The Undertaker, who went on to become the WWF Champion at the next Survivor Series one year later, and the debut of the Gobbledy Gooker. In addition, Sgt. Slaughter — who was then using an Iraqi sympathizer heel gimmick — delivered a promo where he insulted servicemen stationed in Iraq for Thanksgiving during Operation Desert Shield. Randy Savage was interviewed by Gene Okerlund, and issued a challenge to the The Ultimate Warrior for the WWF Championship. Rick Rude was replaced by Haku after being suspended by WWF President Jack Tunney for insulting the mother of the Big Boss Man; in reality, the "suspension" explained Rude's departure from the WWF over a dispute.

Aftermath.
Crowd reaction to the Gobbledy Gooker was extremely negative, with fans loudly booing as the costumed Héctor Guerrero danced in the ring with announcer "Mean" Gene Okerlund. Although the character made a handful of appearances in taped promos following the Survivor Series, the Gobbledy Gooker soon disappeared and was not mentioned again until the Gimmick Battle Royal at WrestleMania X-Seven. Several years later, WrestleCrap would use the name for its "Gooker Award", presented for the worst gimmicks, storylines or events in wrestling.
Sgt. Slaughter and Randy "Macho Man" Savage both received matches against the Ultimate Warrior for the World Heavyweight Championship. Warrior was initially successful in answering both foes' challenges. Meanwhile, Slaughter and his manager, General Adnan, cut several anti-American promos – all airing at a time when the United States was engaged in Operation Desert Shield, all to build up heat for his match against Warrior at the 1991 Royal Rumble. Slaughter – with help from both Savage and Savage's manager, Sensational Sherri – won the World title from Warrior at the Royal Rumble … the event taking place two days after the United States officially declared war on Iraq and the Gulf War began.
Hogan went on to focus on wrapping up his feud with Earthquake with a series of stretcher matches, which Hogan won, before going on to challenge Slaughter for the WWF World Heavyweight title.
Since the formation of Demolition in 1987, they had been compared to the Legion of Doom as to who the best power-brawling tag team was. The feud between Demolition (which by now was Brian Adams and Barry Darsow as Crush and Smash, respectively) and LOD continued to rage into the end of 1990, with LOD eventually proving decisively they were the best team. (In part, the feud had not had the anticipated intensity because of Bill Eadie's reduced role in the tag team; he had competed as Ax, due to health problems and his focus on gaining an office role.) As such, Demolition began losing their push, Mr. Fuji was phased out as their manager and their last major tag team appearance at a United States pay-per-view event was at WrestleMania VII, where the team lost to Genichiro Tenryu and Koji Kitao. LOD, meanwhile, would eventually become World Tag Team Champions.
The Undertaker would quickly become over with fans as he easily handled lower-card competition during his first months in the WWF. He quickly earned his first main-event feud with the Ultimate Warrior, with that feud starting shortly after WrestleMania VII and kick-starting a career with WWF/WWE that has lasted for more than two decades.

Musashi Gundoh

Produced on a low budget, the series has been infamous for poor animation, and has attracted a cult following for this reason. It uses uncropped live photos for backgrounds, and its sound effects are completely out of synch with the animation. Musashi Gundoh is the first and only anime solely produced by ACC Production ( Monkey Punch is an executive), which provided photography and production assistance in various productions. It is also animator Yuki Kinoshita's directorial debut while previously working as a technical animation director, storyboard artist and key animator.
Overview.
Musashi Gundoh is set in a fictional feudal era of Japan, where the Toyotomi Shogunate (instead of Tokugawa) governs the nation. The anime tells the story of Musashi, a young practitioner of , a martial art involving the use of guns. The series deals with Musashi's battles against a group of monsters called "Ayakashi".
Quality issues.
In 2006, Japan's televised anime market was severely oversaturated, at the breaking point of an anime bubble which had also hit America and Europe. Musashi was one of over 60 new shows airing during its season. The plot relies on many action scenes, but the direction of these scenes attempts to somehow mix traditional swordfight imagery with gunplay.
Yuki Kinoshita, the director, was not attempting to create a bad anime. He was deeply embarrassed by the show's reception. He attempted to fix the many animation errors for the DVD release, but the DVDs ended up being released as is.
Characters.
Musashi side.
"His notable line: "
The Horse
GUNDOH (GUN道).
Gun martial art that Musashi, Priest Takuan, and Kojirou Sasaki use. The GUNDOH basic posture involves holding the gun in one hand and a sword in the other hand. Because Musashi uses two guns, people call him the "GUNDOH SAMURAI of two guns". It is said that the GUNDOH doesn't have regulations in the gun used, and the Kojirou Sasaki used a gun with a long pole.
History.
It is assumed that the Priest Takuan made it known to the whole country in Japan though the birthplace and the initiator are uncertain. A lot of those who train become his apprentices, and the training of the GUNDOH is piled every day. Gundoh, despite being super-effective, has few practitioners due to fatalities during training exercises, which typically last less than 3 seconds. It is said the title character, Musashi, is a survivor of the training solely by virtue of his having never actually attended any classes. This is evidenced by his having been kidnapped by crows, foxes, cats, chimpanzees, koalas and the like, on an almost daily basis.

Mbalam

Mbalam is a place in Cameroon near the southern border with the Republic of the Congo where there are significant deposits of iron ore. The mining company is Sundance Resources Limited.
Namesakes.
There are two other places in Cameroon with the same name.
Railway.
A 510 km railway connection to a deepwater port is required to exploit these ore deposits efficiently. Several routes were planned using Quantm software. The railway will start at an elevation of about 650m at the mine, proceed along a fairly level alignment for 350km, drops steeply for 100 km down to the coastal plain, then traverses that plain for 50 km to the port. The gradients generally favour loaded trains.
In September 2010, Sundance Resources signed a memorandum of understanding with CRCC China-Africa Construction Ltd, which outlined construction plans for a 490 km railway linking the planned iron ore mines to a proposed port near Lolabé. Another Chinese company, China Harbour Engineering Co Ltd (CHEC), will build the port.
A two stage development of a mine, railway and port for the cross border iron ore deposits in Cameroon and Congo is estimated to cost $US7.7b. 
Traffic.
The new railway is expected to carry 35 million tonnes of ore per year for 25 years.

Community practice

Community Practice is a branch of social work in the United States that focuses on larger social systems and social change, and is tied to the historical roots of United States social work. The field of community practice social work encompasses community organizing, social planning, human service management, community development, policy analysis, policy advocacy, evaluation, mediation, electronic advocacy and other larger systems interventions. In the field of social work, community practice is often contrasted with direct practice social work, in which social workers work directly with individuals solving micro-level problems. Community Practice has been referred to in the past as Macro Practice, though Community Practice is now the standard term in the United States.
Community Practice has considerable overlap with many other applied social sciences, such as urban planning, economic development, public affairs, rural sociology and nonprofit management. Community Practice social workers typically have a Masters in Social Work (MSW). There are several MSW programs in the United States that offer Community Practice Concentrations, while many other MSW programs offer specializations in one or several types of community practice, such as social services administration or policy analysis. The professional group of community practitioners is the Association for Community Organization and Social Administration (ACOSA), which publishes the leading journal in the field, The Journal of Community Practice.

Survivor Series (1991)

Survivor Series (1991) was the fifth annual Survivor Series pay-per-view professional wrestling event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It took place on Thanksgiving Eve, November 27, 1991 at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan. It was the first Survivor Series to feature a singles match of any kind, with The Undertaker challenging Hulk Hogan for the WWF Championship.

Aftermath.
Due to Ric Flair's involvement in the events leading to The Undertaker's WWF World Heavyweight Championship victory over Hulk Hogan, a rematch was immediately signed for the This Tuesday in Texas pay-per-view event, contested December 3 at the Freeman Coliseum in San Antonio, Texas. WWF president Jack Tunney was present at ringside to make sure there was no outside interference. During the match, Flair once again attempted to interfere on The Undertaker's behalf, but – in a chaotic series of events that saw Tunney get knocked out – Hogan was able to pin The Undertaker after throwing ash from manager Paul Bearer's urn in his eyes. The following weekend, Jack Tunney vacated the WWF Championship due to the controversial finishes of the last two matches between Hogan and Undertaker, and put the title up for grabs at the 1992 Royal Rumble. Meanwhile, Hogan and Flair began wrestling in a series of matches that had been highly anticipated since the late 1980s.
Dissension had been brewing for weeks between Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty of the Rockers, and at their Survivor Series match the two argued after Jannetty caused Michaels to be eliminated by accidentally slamming one of the Nasty Boys into him. In a segment of Brutus "the Barber" Beefcake's "Barber Shop" talk show segment taped December 2 and aired several weeks later, the two aired their grievances before seemingly resolving to stick together and work through their difficulties. However, Michaels superkicked Jannetty and threw him through a plate-glass window that was part of Beefcake's set, cementing Michaels' heel turn. A feud was commissioned, but Jannetty was fired in January 1992, shortly before their first match was to take place; the two eventually met in a series of matches in 1993, when Jannetty returned. However, for Michaels, the "Barber Shop" segment and the superkick jumpstarted a career that would skyrocket exponentially, and during the 1990s and 2000s he became one of the biggest superstars in professional wrestling history.

Survivor Series (1992)

Survivor Series (1992) was the sixth annual Survivor Series pay-per-view professional wrestling event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It took place on November 25, 1992 at the Richfield Coliseum in Richfield Township, Ohio. The buildup to the pay-per-view consisted of feuds scripted by the WWF's writers, and the matches that took place at the event had pre-determined outcomes that had been decided by the company.
Unlike previous Survivor Series events, Survivor Series 1992 placed a strong emphasis on one-on-one wrestling matches rather than tag team elimination matches. In the main event, Bret Hart retained his WWF Championship in a match against Shawn Michaels. The event also featured a highly-promoted match between the team of Randy Savage and Mr. Perfect and the team of Ric Flair and Razor Ramon. Savage and Perfect won the match when the referee disqualified Flair and Ramon. Two specialty matches also took place, as The Big Boss Man defeated Nailz in a nightstick on a pole match, and The Undertaker won a coffin match against Kamala.
Some of the matches were changed after they were first announced, as several wrestlers left the WWF shortly before the event. Critics have praised the WWF Championship match and the tag team match that was won by Savage and Perfect. Although the remaining matches have received low ratings, critics have felt that the two main events made the event worth watching.
Background.
In the storyline behind the match between The Big Boss Man and Nailz, Nailz claimed that while he was serving time in prison, the Big Boss Man, who was a guard at the prison, mistreated Nailz. In early 1992, Nailz appeared in introductory vignettes to talk about his hatred of the Big Boss Man. Upon his debut in the WWF, Nailz attacked Bossman and stole his nightstick, which he used to attack his opponents over the following months.
Shortly after Tatanka's debut in the WWF, he became involved in a feud with Rick Martel. They faced each other at WrestleMania VIII, and Tatanka defeated Martel. The following month, Martel gained revenge by attacking Tatanka with an atomizer of cologne and stealing the eagle feathers that Tatanka carried to symbolize his Lumbee heritage.
Ric Flair and his "executive consultant" Mr. Perfect had been allies in the WWF for much of 1992. After Flair lost the WWF Championship to Randy Savage at WrestleMania VIII, Flair and Perfect initiated a feud with Savage. They interfered in Savage's match at SummerSlam and caused him to lose by countout. The rivalry continued, and Flair received assistance from Perfect and Razor Ramon to win the title back from Savage on September 1, which aired on the September 14 edition of WWF Prime Time Wrestling. The WWF planned for Savage to team with the Ultimate Warrior in a match against Flair and Ramon at Survivor Series. The Ultimate Warrior left the WWF, however, before the match could take place. Two possible reasons have been given for his departure. The first states that he was fired due to allegations of steroid abuse, while the other states that he was upset with the WWF's future plans for his character. The WWF was forced to change the plan and decided to turn Perfect into a babyface (fan favorite) from a heel. Perfect and Flair began having conflicts while teaming together, and Perfect accepted Savage's offer on the November 16 episode of "WWF Prime Time Wrestling" to team with him at Survivor Series.
Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) had been feuding with The Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon) since February 1992 when manager Jimmy Hart turned on Earthquake and Typhoon in favor of helping Money, Inc. With Hart's assistance, Money, Inc. defeated the Legion of Doom for the WWF Tag Team Championship on February 7, 1992. Five months later, Earthquake and Typhoon defeated Money Inc. to win the championship. The Natural Disasters were also feuding with the Beverly Brothers (Beau and Blake) and defeated them in a title match at SummerSlam 1992. A match was then announced for Survivor Series in which The Natural Disasters would team with The Bushwhackers (Luke and Butch) to face Money, Inc. and the Nasty Boys (Jerry Sags and Brian Knobs), both at that time managed by Jimmy Hart. However, when the Nasty Boys were scheduled to face The Natural Disasters for the title on October 13, Hart at the last minute replaced the Nasty Boys with Money, Inc., who went on to regain the championship with help from The Headshrinkers. This led to a break-up between Hart and the Nasty Boys, who received the Bushwhackers' spot in the Survivor Series match to get revenge against Jimmy Hart and Money, Inc.
At SummerSlam 1992 in August, The Undertaker defeated Kamala. Harvey Wippleman, Kamala's manager wanted revenge, so a rematch was scheduled for Survivor Series. The match was promoted as the WWF's first coffin match, in which the winner would place the loser in a coffin after the match.
The WWF also planned a match featuring The British Bulldog defending the WWF Intercontinental Championship against The Mountie at Survivor Series. The WWF released Smith due to steroid allegations, however, and he was made to drop the title belt to Shawn Michaels on the November 14 episode of "Saturday Night's Main Event". Jake Roberts was set to challenge Bret Hart, who had won the WWF Championship on October 12, for his title, but the promotion could not come to terms with Roberts. Ultimately, the WWF neglected to include an Intercontinental Championship match on the card, instead pitting Michaels against Hart. In this match, Hart's title was defended while Michaels' title was not.
Event.
Prior to the pay-per-view broadcast, Crush defeated the Brooklyn Brawler via submission. In the first televised match, High Energy (Owen Hart and Koko B. Ware) faced The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu). Samu used his strength advantage to control the opening of the match against Hart. Ware entered the match and gained the advantage over both opponents until he attempted to knock The Headshrinkers' heads against each other. According to WWF storylines, Samoans like The Headshrinkers have thick skulls and cannot be hurt in the head; as a result, The Headshrinkers no-sold the attack. Afa, The Headshrinkers' manager, attacked Ware while the referee was distracted. Samu and Fatu took turns attacking Ware, and Fatu performed a thrust kick on Ware. The Headshrinkers used rulebreaking tactics to control the match until Hart was able to enter the match. He performed dropkicks from the top rope against both Headshrinkers. As he tried to attack Samu from the top rope again, Samu caught him and powerslammed him before Fatu executed a diving splash to get the pinfall victory.
The next match, between The Big Boss Man and Nailz, was a nightstick on a pole match. A nightstick was suspended above the ring and could be used as a weapon once it was retrieved. Nailz began the match by attempting to get the nightstick, but Boss Man stopped him. Nailz choked Boss Man before making another unsuccessful attempt to climb the pole and obtain the nightstick. Boss Man punched Nailz and then tried to climb the pole. Nailz stopped him, performed a back body drop, and choked Boss Man again. Boss Man regained control but missed a splash, which gave Nailz another chance to retrieve the nightstick. Both men clotheslined each other, but Boss Man recovered first and got the nightstick. He hit Nailz with it, but Nailz took it and used it against Boss Man. Boss Man performed the Boss Man slam, his finishing move, before pinning Nailz to win the match.
Tatanka controlled the opening of the next match against "The Model" Rick Martel with several throws and dropkicks. Martel responded by wearing Tatanka down with a front facelock. Tatanka escaped, but Martel used another front facelock almost immediately. He performed a neckbreaker on Tatanka before going back to the same hold as before. Tatanka gained the advantage by performing a clothesline on Martel. Martel ran at Tatanka, but Tatanka moved out of the way and Martel hit his shoulder against the ring post. Tatanka focused on attacking Martel's injured shoulder but eventually was thrown out of the ring by Martel. Martel's advantage was short-lived, as Tatanka performed a series of backhand chops and a Tomahawk chop from the top rope before nailing The Model with a Samoan drop. Tatanka got the pinfall victory and retrieved his feathers from Martel after the match. While the match was in progress, Doink the Clown, who had not yet been named or debuted as a wrestler in the WWF, stood in the aisle and made balloon animals before popping them to upset the children in the audience.
One of the main event matches came next, as Ric Flair and Razor Ramon wrestled against Mr. Perfect and Randy Savage. Ramon and Perfect began the match, but Flair entered after Perfect insulted him. Perfect threw Flair into the corner, and Flair's momentum carried him over the top rope to the ring apron. Savage attacked Flair and then took Perfect's place in the ring to maintain the advantage over Flair. From outside the ring, Ramon hit Savage with his knee and Flair and Ramon took turns attacking Savage's knee. While Ramon performed a half Boston crab on Savage, Perfect considered leaving the match and abandoning Savage. Savage recovered briefly by trying to pin Flair, but Ramon performed a chokeslam on Savage. Ric Flair attempted to attack Savage from the top rope, but Savage threw him to the ring floor instead. Perfect executed a neckbreaker and an atomic drop on Ramon. Outside of the ring, Flair attacked Savage with a chair. The referee was knocked unconscious, and Perfect tried to pin Ramon by performing a PerfectPlex. Because no referee was available to count the pinfall, a substitute referee came to the ring. The first referee recovered as Perfect attempted to pin Flair with a PerfectPlex. Flair escaped the pin attempt, and he and Ramon attacked Perfect until the referees were unable to keep the match under control. As a result, Ramon and Flair were disqualified, and the victory was awarded to Perfect and Savage.
In the next match, Virgil faced Yokozuna, who was billed at 505 pounds. Virgil was unable to knock Yokozuna down with several dropkicks. Yokozuna performed a savate kick on Virgil before throwing him to the ring floor twice. He executed a legdrop on Virgil, but Virgil regained the advantage when Yokozuna accidentally ran into the ring pole while trying to attack Virgil. Yokozuna won the match after a splash in the corner and a Banzai Drop.
The following match was a tag team elimination match, in which The Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon) teamed with the Nasty Boys (Jerry Sags and Brian Knobbs) to face Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) and the Beverly Brothers (Beau and Blake). The rules stated that when any man was eliminated, his tag team partner would also be eliminated. Blake Beverly and Typhoon began the match, but Beau and Earthquake soon entered the ring as well. The Natural Disasters gained control of the match by attacking Blake Beverly, and the Nasty Boys entered the ring to assist the Disasters. Blake attacked Sags and tagged out of the match. Beau entered but was bodyslammed by Sags; Sags got distracted, however, which allowed Beau to suplex him and bring DiBiase into the match. Money Inc. took turns attacking Sags until Earthquake entered the ring. Earthquake performed an Earthquake splash by sitting on Beau Beverly to pin him and eliminate both Beverly Brothers. Earthquake fought DiBiase, but both men eventually left the ring and were replaced by their partners. Typhoon performed a splash on Schyster but was tripped by DiBiase. Schyster pinned Typhoon to eliminate The Natural Disasters. While Schyster was celebrating, Sags quickly pinned him to win the match for the Nasty Boys.
The coffin match, in which The Undertaker faced Kamala, came next. Kamala began the match by running in fear from The Undertaker. He gained the early advantage, however, by suddenly turning around and attacking The Undertaker. Kamala bodyslammed The Undertaker three times and performed three splashes. In an attempt to revive The Undertaker, Paul Bearer, his manager, held up an urn that was said to be the source of The Undertaker's power. Kim Chee, one of Kamala's handler's attacked Bearer. The Undertaker picked up the urn, which had rolled into the ring, and hit Kamala with it. The Undertaker pinned Kamala to win the match, placed him in a coffin, and nailed the lid shut.
In the final match of the event, Bret Hart defended his WWF Championship against Shawn Michaels. Hart controlled the beginning of the match by repeatedly executing armdrags and armbars but Michaels gained the advantage when "the Hitman" missed a charge into the corner and collided shoulder-first with the ring post. Michaels then threw Hart into another ring post and wore him down by executing a front facelock. Hart was able to avoid Michaels' first attempt at his finisher, the modified back suplex, and rallied with his trademark moves including an elbow from the second rope, running bulldog and a superplex. Michaels recovered and performed a superkick on Hart and was able this time to apply his suplex, but Hart kicked out. After Hart missed a desperation crossbody and crotched himself on the ropes, Shawn attempted a dropkick from the middle rope but Hart grabbed Michaels' legs and applied the Sharpshooter, his finishing move. He retained his championship by forcing Michaels to submit.
Aftermath.
Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect continued their feud, although Flair legitimately requested to be released from his WWF contract in order to return to World Championship Wrestling (WCW). His request was granted on the condition that he help build up Perfect as a credible babyface. The two men attacked each other during the battle royal at Royal Rumble 1993, and Perfect eliminated Flair from the match. The following night, Perfect defeated Flair in a loser leaves town match. Flair did not return to the WWF until McMahon purchased WCW in 2001.
The Undertaker's feud with Harvey Wippleman continued for several months after Survivor Series. At Royal Rumble 1993, Wippleman introduced a new wrestler named Giant Gonzalez. Despite not being scheduled in the match, Gonzalez attacked The Undertaker and eliminated him from the Royal Rumble match. The two men faced each other at WrestleMania IX, where Gonzalez was disqualified for attacking The Undertaker with a rag soaked in chloroform. Wippleman led Gonzalez and Mr. Hughes in another attack on The Undertaker, in which Hughes stole The Undertaker's urn. The feud was resolved at SummerSlam 1993, when The Undertaker defeated Gonzalez in a Rest in Peace match.
Yokozuna's push continued, and he won the battle royal main event at Royal Rumble 1993 to earn a WWF Championship match against Bret Hart at WrestleMania IX. At WrestleMania, he defeated Hart to win the title belt. He immediately challenged Hulk Hogan to a match however, and WrestleMania ended with Yokozuna losing the WWF Championship to Hogan in 21 seconds.
Kevin Wacholz, who had portrayed Nailz, left the WWF shortly after Survivor Series. Upset about his pay from SummerSlam 1992, he confronted WWF owner Vince McMahon and reportedly attacked him physically. He later testified against McMahon during a trial in which McMahon was accused of distributing steroids to wrestlers. Wacholz' statements have been reported as having a harmful effect on the prosecution's case because his anger at McMahon overshadowed his testimony.
Shawn Michaels became involved in a feud with his former tag team partner, Marty Jannetty. The team had split up earlier in the year when Michaels attacked Jannetty. Michaels defeated Jannetty at Royal Rumble 1993, but the two traded the Intercontinental Championship back and forth in subsequent rematches.
Reception.
Survivor Series 1992 was attended by 17,500 fans, the same number as the previous year. It drew more fans than any of the following three Survivor Series event would draw. The pay-per-view buyrate was 1.4, which means that 1.4 percent of households to which the event was available purchased the pay-per-view. This was, to that point, the lowest buyrate in Survivor Series history and down more than one-third from the previous year's 2.2 buyrate. The buyrate was higher than that of any of the following twelve Survivor Series events, however.
Writing for "The History of WWE", Matt Pettycord stated that the event was "pretty decent" considering that The Mountie, Davey Boy Smith, and the Ultimate Warrior left the company shortly before the event. On a five-star scale, he rated only the Flair/Ramon vs. Savage/Perfect match and the Hart vs. Michaels match higher than one star. He stated that the event is "recommended, but not required", although the WWF Championship match was a "must-see".
Adam Gutschmidt, reviewing the event for "Online Onslaught", gave a rating of one-quarter star for the Nightstick on a Pole match and one-half star each for the High Energy vs. The Headshrinkers match and the Yokozuna vs. Virgil match. He enjoyed the WWF Championship match, although he was disappointed by its lack of buildup prior to the event. He also felt that the Flair/Ramon vs. Savage/Perfect match was a good one until the ending got out of control. "Pro Wrestling Torch" columnist agreed, stating that the WWF Championship match was the best and that the Flair/Ramon vs. Savage/Perfect bout was also enjoyable, but he recommended fast-forwarding through the rest of the show.
The event was released in North America on VHS by Coliseum Video on February 11, 1993. The VHS version was released in the United Kingdom on March 8, 1993. A DVD version is also available in the United Kingdom; it was packaged together with Survivor Series 1991 as part of the WWE Tagged Classics line and released on November 7, 2005.

Survivor Series (1993)

Survivor Series (1993) was the seventh annual Survivor Series pay-per-view professional wrestling event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It took place on Thanksgiving Eve, November 24, 1993 at the Boston Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. The buildup to the pay-per-view consisted of feuds scripted by the WWF's writers, and the matches that took place at the event had pre-determined outcomes that had been decided by the promotion. The event has been criticized by several reviewers, who have pointed to Jerry Lawler and Doink the Clown not appearing and a dull main event as problems that hurt the show.
The event featured four tag-team elimination matches and a bout for the Smoky Mountain Wrestling Tag Team Championship. The main event match saw the All-Americans, a team of face wrestlers from the United States, competing against the Foreign Fanatics, a team of heels that represented other countries. The All-Americans won the match when Lex Luger was the last man remaining. In an undercard match, four members of the Hart family competed against Shawn Michaels and a group of masked men. The original plan was for the Harts to face Jerry Lawler, with whom they were feuding, but Lawler was not able to appear at the event. The Harts won the match, but a confrontation between Bret Hart and Owen Hart after the match led to Owen turning against the family the following year.
The majority of the feuds remained unresolved and carried on to future events. Bam Bam Bigelow was scheduled to face his main rival, Doink the Clown, but Bigelow's team ended up facing four other wrestlers wearing clown makeup instead. Matches from the Survivor Series also helped set up feuds for Royal Rumble 1994, the WWF's next pay-per-view. Razor Ramon's rivalry with Irwin R. Schyster intensified at Survivor Series and led to Ramon defending his WWF Intercontinental Championship against Schyster at the Royal Rumble. This event also marked the beginning of The Undertaker's feud with Yokozuna, and Yokozuna defended his WWF Championship against The Undertaker at the Royal Rumble.
Background.
Several feuds surrounded the opening match, which saw the team of Razor Ramon, Marty Jannetty, the 1–2–3 Kid and Mr. Perfect face the team of Irwin R. Schyster (I.R.S.), Diesel, Rick Martel, and Adam Bomb. Diesel made his WWF debut on June 6, 1993 as a bodyguard for Shawn Michaels in a match between Michaels and Jannetty. Diesel's interference in the match helped Michaels to defeat Jannetty and win the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Diesel was also at ringside to help Michaels when Michaels faced Mr. Perfect for the title belt at SummerSlam 1993. Diesel attacked Perfect on multiple occasions during the match and ultimately caused Perfect to lose the match via countout. In September 1993, Michaels was stripped of the Intercontinental Championship by WWF President Jack Tunney. A battle royal was scheduled to determine the top two contenders for the championship. Ramon and Martel were the last two wrestlers in the ring, and they faced each other in a title match on the September 27 episode of "Monday Night Raw". Ramon won the match and was awarded the championship belt.
Schyster had initiated a feud with Ramon in May 1993 after Ramon lost a match to The Kid (later the 1–2–3 Kid), who was competing as a jobber at the time. Schyster and his tag team partner Ted DiBiase made fun of Ramon for the loss and offered him a job as a servant. In response, Ramon teamed with the 1–2–3 Kid for a series of matches against Schyster and DiBiase, and he also distracted Schyster during a match and caused him to lose to jobber P.J. Walker. Adam Bomb was not involved in any feuds with his opponents at Survivor Series, but there was animosity between Bomb and his teammate Rick Martel. Bomb's manager, Harvey Wippleman, was at ringside to help Martel in a match against Ramon. Wippleman was standing in the way of the match, and Martel ran in to him. While Martel was distracted, Ramon pinned him to win the match. Martel then yelled at Wippleman and pushed him. Bomb came to the ring to defend his manager, and an argument ensued until Diesel and Schyster came to the ring to calm their teammates.
Jerry Lawler spent much of 1993 building a feud with the Hart family. Lawler had been using the nickname "The King" since defeating Jackie Fargo for the AWA Southern Heavyweight Championship in 1974. After Bret Hart won the WWF's 1993 King of the Ring tournament, Lawler confronted him and claimed to be the only king in the WWF. Lawler then attacked Hart from behind, hitting Hart with the scepter and throne that had been set up for the coronation ceremony. The feud escalated when Lawler involved Helen and Stu Hart, Bret's parents, by insulting them while serving as commentator for WWF television programs. In what was billed as a "Family Feud" match, Bret Hart was joined by his brother Owen, who also worked for the WWF at the time, as well as his brothers Bruce and Keith, both of whom had also wrestled professionally. Lawler's partners were three masked wrestlers known only as the Blue Knight, the Red Knight, and the Black Knight.
Lawler was unable to appear at the event, however, as he was indicted after being accusing of raping and sodomizing a teenage girl, who later admitted to making up the story. Shawn Michaels, who replaced Lawler in the match, also had a rivalry with Bret Hart dating back to the previous year. Hart, who held the Intercontinental Championship for much of 1992, defended the belt against Michaels many times, including in the WWF's first ladder match. They had also wrestled each other in the main event of Survivor Series 1992, when Hart defended his newly-won WWF Championship against Michaels.
The Smoky Mountain Wrestling Tag Team Championship was defended at Survivor Series as part of a working agreement between WWF owner Vince McMahon and Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW) owner Jim Cornette. The Rock 'n' Roll Express, who held the belts going into the event, had been feuding with The Heavenly Bodies over the title for over a year. The rivalry had been violent at times, including a barbed wire cage match and a Texas deathmatch.
Doink the Clown had annoyed Bam Bam Bigelow throughout October and November with such pranks as throwing water and confetti on him and dumping a pail of water on Bigelow's on-screen girlfriend Luna Vachon. He also tied a tripwire across the aisle during one of Bigelow's matches; after Bigelow fell over the wire, Doink attacked him with a broom. Bigelow responded by coming to the ring during one of Doink's matches and destroying Doink's toy wagon. The character of Doink was played by several wrestlers, who occasionally appeared at the same time. The match booked for Survivor Series advertised Bigelow teaming with Bastion Booger, who portrayed an overweight and dirty glutton, and The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu), a team of Samoans who were portrayed as savages, to face four Doinks. To promote the match, Doink appeared on the video wall that was part of the set during Bigelow's matches leading up to the event. The wall used a split screen to show multiple Doinks talking and laughing at the same time.
The main event match featured the team of the All-Americans, which consisted of Lex Luger, Tatanka, and the Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott Steiner) facing the Foreign Fanatics, which consisted of Yokozuna, Ludvig Borga, and The Quebecers (Jacques and Pierre). The main storyline behind the match began that summer when Yokozuna, a Japanese sumo wrestler, challenged any American athlete to bodyslam him on the deck of the USS "Intrepid" during an event on Independence Day. After several challengers were unable to lift Yokozuna, Luger arrived via helicopter and successfully performed what was termed "the bodyslam heard around the world". Luger was granted a match for Yokozuna's WWF Championship at SummerSlam. Luger got a victory via countout but did not win the title. In the dressing room after the match, Borga, a Finnish wrestler, interrupted Luger's celebration by criticizing Luger and initiating a new feud.
The Steiner Brothers spent the fall 1993 feuding with The Quebecers, a Canadian tag team. They had faced each other several times since The Quebecers had won the WWF Tag Team Championship from the Steiners on September 13. Since arriving in the WWF, Tatanka had been on a two-year winning streak. Borga ended the streak on the October 30, 1993 episode of "WWF Superstars" by pinning Tatanka after hitting him with a chair. After the match, Borga and Yokozuna attacked Tatanka, causing kayfabe injuries that forced Tatanka to withdraw from the match at Survivor Series. The All-Americans recruited The Undertaker to replace Tatanka. On the November 15 episode of "Monday Night Raw", Luger defeated Pierre; as a result of a kayfabe injury in the match, the Foreign Fanatics had to replace Pierre with Crush, the sole American of the team.
Crush was feuding with Randy Savage going into the event. They had been on-screen friends, but Crush was angry that Savage had not saved him from an attack by Yokozuna on the July 12, 1993 episode of "Monday Night Raw". To make his injuries seem real, Crush did not appear on WWF television programming for several months. He made his return on October 18, accompanied by Yokozuna's manager, Mr. Fuji, claiming that they sympathized with Crush's sense of betrayal by Savage. Savage tried to make amends with Crush, who then attacked Savage and announced that he had turned against Savage and the United States and was aligning himself with Yokozuna, Fuji, and Japan.
Event.
Prior to the televised broadcast, Billy Gunn defeated The Brooklyn Brawler in a dark match. The first match on the pay-per-view event saw Razor Ramon, Mr. Perfect, the 1–2–3 Kid, and Marty Jannetty face Diesel, Irwin R. Schyster, Rick Martel, and Adam Bomb. Prior to the match, Ramon announced that Randy Savage was taking the place of Perfect, who was unable to appear. Martel and Ramon began the match in the ring, but Martel soon tagged out to bring Bomb into the match. Ramon performed a suplex on Bomb and attempted to pin his opponent. Martel tried to rescue his partner but ended up hitting Bomb instead and causing an argument. The 1–2–3 Kid entered the match but was overpowered by Bomb and Diesel. After the Kid tagged out, Savage performed a diving elbow drop on Diesel before getting the pinfall to eliminate Diesel from the match. Ramon was attacked by his opponents but eventually tagged Savage back into the match. Savage got distracted when Crush appeared in the aisle, however, which allowed Schyster to eliminate him from the match. Ramon then performed a Razor's Edge on Schyster and pinned him. Ramon attempted the same move on Martel, but Schyster snuck back into the ring and hit Ramon with a briefcase. Ramon fell out of the ring and was counted out of the match. The remaining four wrestlers fought back and forth, but the 1–2–3 Kid eventually pinned Martel after a sunset flip. Almost immediately, Jannetty performed a sunset flip on Bomb to win the match for his team.
The next bout was the "Family Feud" match that saw the Hart brothers (Bret, Owen, Bruce, and Keith) facing Shawn Michaels and His Knights. The knights wore masks to hide their identities, but it has been revealed that Jeff Gaylord was the Black Knight, Greg Valentine was the Blue Knight, and Barry Horowitz was the Red Knight. Ray Combs, then host of "Family Feud", told jokes to insult Shawn Michaels prior to the bout and later served as guest commentator for the match. Michaels began the match by wrestling Bruce Hart. Although Michaels was able to go on the offensive against the Hart brothers, the knights were unable to achieve much success against the Harts. At one point, all four wrestlers brawled in the ring, but Owen was able to eliminate the Black Knight after performing a missile dropkick. Michaels and the knights regained control of the match, but Bret turned things around by eliminating the Red Knight via submission to the Sharpshooter. Bret sustained a kayfabe injury after being thrown out of the ring and sat out of the match for a few minutes. Meanwhile, Michaels provoked Stu Hart into punching him. Inside the ring, Owen forced the Blue Knight to submit to the Sharpshooter, which left Michaels by himself. While Bret was standing on the ring apron, however, Owen ran in to him and got distracted. This allowed Michaels to pin Owen and eliminate him from the match. Bret dominated the rest of the match against Michaels until Michaels walked back to the locker room. As a result, Michaels was counted out, and the Harts won the match. After the match, Owen returned to the ring and yelled at Bret, blaming Bret for causing him to be eliminated from the match.
All four men began the SMW Tag Team Championship match in the ring. The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) controlled most of the opening of the match with aerial maneuvers against The Heavenly Bodies (Jimmy Del Ray and Tom Pritchard). Del Ray tried to help his partner but superkicked him instead. The Heavenly Bodies gained the advantage after Pritchard performed a powerbomb on Morton, which Del Ray followed with a moonsault. Del Ray and Morton fought back and forth, with Del Ray performing another moonsault and Morton executing a hurricanrana. After all four wrestlers brawled in the ring once more, Del Ray hit Gibson in the back with a tennis racquet. Pritchard then pinned Gibson to win the belts for The Heavenly Bodies.
The next match was supposed to feature Bam Bam Bigelow, Bastion Booger, and The Headshrinkers against four Doinks. Instead of the usual Doink the Clown, Men on a Mission (Mabel and Mo) and The Bushwhackers (Luke and Butch) appeared, wearing clown wigs and facepaint. Headshrinker Samu was eliminated first after he bit several of the balloons being carried by his opponents. One balloon was filled with water, and Samu fell in surprise and was pinned by Luke. Booger performed his signature move on Luke, a jumping groin drop that he referred to as the "Trip to the Batcave". He then left his opponent, however, and got a banana to eat. Luke recovered, and The Bushwhackers performed the battering ram on Booger. Mabel then executed a splash on Booger and pinned him. Down four wrestlers to two, Bigelow's team appeared to be making a comeback when Fatu performed a top rope splash onto Mo. Fatu got distracted, however, and examined a banana peel with curiosity. Butch entered the ring and pretended to throw water on Fatu from an empty bucket. Fatu, slipping on the banana peel, fell over, and Butch pinned him to eliminate him from the match. Left by himself, Bigelow got upset when Butch dumped a bucket of water on Bigelow's on-screen girlfriend, Luna Vachon. Men on a Mission attacked Bigelow while he was distracted, and all four clowns pinned Bigelow to win the match. After the match, the real Doink the Clown appeared on the video screen to taunt Bigelow.
In the final match of the evening, The All-Americans, consisting of Lex Luger, The Undertaker, and The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott), competed against the Foreign Fanatics (Yokozuna, Ludvig Borga, Quebecer Jacques, and Crush). Scott Steiner and Jacques began the match, but Scott soon tagged in his brother Rick. Rick knocked Yokozuna out of the ring, but he was unable to perform much offense against Borga. Rick attempted a crossbody, during which Borga was supposed to catch him. Borga botched the move, but he pinned Rick anyway to eliminate him from the match. Crush faced Scott Steiner inside the ring, but Randy Savage then appeared in the aisle trying to get to the ring but was restrained by officials and The Smoking Gunns. Scott knocked Crush out of the ring, and Crush fought with Savage until being counted out of the match. Scott then turned his attention to Jacques before tagging Luger into the match. Luger eliminated Jacques with an elbow drop and a pinfall. Scott Steiner re-entered the match and executed a superplex on Borga. When he tried to pin Borga, however, Yokozuna entered the ring. Yokozuna performed a leg drop on Steiner and pinned him to even the match at two wrestlers each. Luger fought with Borga and Yokozuna before tagging The Undertaker into the match. The Undertaker gained control of the match, but Yokozuna turned the momentum around by performing his signature move, the Banzai drop, on The Undertaker. When he attempted the move a second time, The Undertaker sat up. The two men then fought outside the ring until both were counted out and eliminated from the match. Luger and Borga then fought back and forth until Luger performed a running forearm smash and pinned Borga to win the match. After the match, Santa Claus came to the ring to celebrate with Luger.
Aftermath.
Razor Ramon continued with two of his feuds after Survivor Series. Irwin R. Schyster stole Ramon's gold chains, which set up a match for the Intercontinental Championship at Royal Rumble 1994. Despite interference from Shawn Michaels, Ramon pinned Schyster to retain the title. Michaels and Ramon then faced each other at WrestleMania X. Diesel got involved, but Ramon won the match. Ramon then defended his title against Diesel on April 13, 1994. Diesel won the match and became the new WWF Intercontinental Champion. Ramon regained the belt in a rematch at SummerSlam 1994, however. Meanwhile, the 1–2–3 Kid and Marty Jannetty continued with their push from the promotion and won the WWF Tag Team Championship on January 10, 1994.
Owen Hart challenged Bret Hart to a match after Survivor Series, but Bret refused to fight his brother. The two reunited to face The Quebecers for the Tag Team Championship at Royal Rumble 1994. Bret sustained a kayfabe injury during the match, which forced the referee to stop the match. Owen blamed Bret for the loss and attacked him after the match. They faced each other at WrestleMania X, where Owen defeated Bret. The rivalry continued, however, and the brothers feuded throughout 1994 and into 1995. Bret's feud with Lawler remained, but the two did not face each other again until In Your House 1 in May 1995. The feud was reignited at that time, and they feuded at several pay-per-view events in 1995.
Bam Bam Bigelow's feud with Doink the Clown remained unresolved for several months. They were in the ring at the same time during the main event of the 1994 Royal Rumble, which was a battle royal-style match. Bigelow attacked Doink and eliminated him from the match. The blow off match came at WrestleMania X, where Doink and his midget sidekick Dink faced Bigelow and his girlfriend Luna Vachon in a mixed tag team match. Bigelow and Vachon won the match to settle the feud.
The Steiner Brothers continued to challenge The Quebecers, but they were unable to regain the Tag Team Championship. As a result of their confrontation at Survivor Series, The Undertaker and Yokozuna faced each other at Royal Rumble 1994 in a casket match for Yokozuna's WWF Championship. Mr. Fuji, Yokozuna's manager, recruited several heel wrestlers to help Yokozuna win the match. The Undertaker supposedly died and disappeared from the WWF for several months, although, in reality, he was simply recovering from injuries. He resumed the feud with Yokozuna upon his return, however, and defeated Yokozuna in a casket match at Survivor Series 1994. Luger also continued his rivalry with Yokozuna. As a co-winner of the 1994 Royal Rumble match, Luger was granted a shot at Yokozuna's WWF Championship. Mr. Perfect, who had returned to the WWF, was the referee for the match and turned heel by disqualifying Luger during the match.
Ludvig Borga was scheduled to continue his feud with Tatanka in a match at Royal Rumble 1994. Borga sustained a legitimate ankle injury, however, and never returned to the WWF. WWF writers had also planned to have Borga feud with Luger, but they were forced to drop the storyline because of Borga's departure.
Crush and Randy Savage also continued their feud. They fought each other during the battle royal at Royal Rumble 1994 until Crush eliminated Savage. To end the rivalry, they faced each other in a Falls Count Anywhere match at WrestleMania X, which Savage won.
Reception.
The attendance for the event was 15,509, which generated $180,000 in ticket sales. This was the lowest attendance for a Survivor Series event since 1989. The pay-per-view buyrate was 0.82, down from 1.4 the previous year, and was the lowest buyrate in Survivor Series history to that point.
The event has been rated by several sources. Adam Gutschmidt, writing for "Online Onslaught", stated that "many of the substitutions hurt the matches" and that "the main event was bland". "The Other Arena" opined that the Four Doinks match was the worst on the card and that the confrontation between Lex Luger and Ludvig Borga was boring. Scott Criscuolo and Justin Rozzero reviewed the event for "The History of WWE". Both writers gave Survivor Series 1993 a "C" rating and viewed the Family Feud match as the worst on the card. Matt Peddycord, writing for "411mania.com", gave the event a 5.5 out of 10 rating. He pointed to the crowd's chant of "We want Doink!" as evidence that fans were upset by the Four Doinks match.
Survivor Series 1993 was released on VHS by Coliseum Video on December 15, 1993 in North America. It was released in the United Kingdom by Silver Vision; the VHS version was released on March 14, 1994, and the DVD was released as part of the WWE Tagged Classics line (packaged together with Survivor Series 1994) on September 4, 2006.

Sologamy

Sologamy is the practice of self-marriage. This occurs when a religious ceremony takes place, creating a new union between a person's physical body and his/her spirit. Sologamy commonly takes place in African tribal societies, such as the Hutu and Por'Quatzi tribes. These African tribesmen believe that when a person enters a sologamist marriage, the human body and the spirit cease to exist separately and a new being, referred to as the "solar body," is born. Generally after the ceremony takes place, the tribe engages in three days of celebrations, including food and ceremonial dancing.
In the late 1970s, sologamy gained some popularity in America (see hippies). The "Hippie" group believed in free love and peace among all humankind, so to demonstrate their tranquility with themselves, they would privately engage in sologamy ceremonies. 
Sologamy is not recognized as a legal binding contract in North America, UK or most European countries. It is however recognized by many African governments as legal due to its tribal affiliations.
Apart from being a religious ceremony, the idea of sologamy has translated into a strong and independent lifestyle. The concept of sologamy was important during the feminist movement by helping to empower women to be strong without outside assistance or the companionship of men.
Recent examples of sologamy.
In 2010, a Taiwanese woman named Chen Wei-yih married herself. "Age thirty is a prime period for me. My work and experience are in good shape, but I haven't found a partner, so what can I do?" Chen said. 
In 2012, a North Dakota woman, Nadine Schweigert also married herself as a celebration of how far she'd come after her divorce six years previous.

Survivor Series (1994)

Survivor Series (1994) was the eighth annual Survivor Series pay-per-view professional wrestling event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It took place on Thanksgiving Eve, November 23, 1994 at the Freeman Coliseum in San Antonio, Texas. It was also the last Survivor Series to take place on the traditional Thanksgiving/Thanksgiving Eve date the show had always occupied since its inception; the following Survivor Series and all subsequent shows have taken place on Sunday nights.
Two main event matches were held; in the first, Bob Backlund won the WWF Championship from Bret Hart in a submission match after Bret's brother Owen convinced their mother to throw in a towel to end the match. In the other main event, The Undertaker defeated Yokozuna in a casket match.
The event also featured three elimination matches and two singles matches. Razor Ramon led The Bad Guys against Diesel's team of The Teamsters. Ramon won the match for his team after all members of the other team were counted out. Doink the Clown teamed with three midgets to form Clowns R' Us in a match against The Royal Family, composed of Jerry Lawler and three midgets. The Royal Family won the match, but all seven other competitors attacked Lawler after the match. Lex Luger led Guts and Glory against the Million Dollar Corporation team, which was managed by Ted DiBiase. DiBiase's team won after Luger, the last wrestler from his team, was pinned.
Shawn Michaels and Diesel, the WWF Tag Team Champions going in to the event, began feuding after Michaels accidentally kicked Diesel during the match. They vacated their title and began a feud that led to a match at WrestleMania XI. Three days after Survivor Series, Diesel won the WWF Championship by defeating Backlund. The rivalry between Backlund and Bret Hart continued, and they also faced each other at WrestleMania XI.
Background.
Several storylines formed the background for the opening match, which saw the fan favorite team of The Bad Guys (Razor Ramon, the 1-2-3 Kid, Davey Boy Smith and The Headshrinkers) square off against the villainous team of The Teamsters (Shawn Michaels, Diesel, Jeff Jarrett, Owen Hart and Jim Neidhart). Razor Ramon had been feuding with Shawn Michaels since September 1993 when Ramon won the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Michaels, the former champion, had been stripped of the belt. WWF President Jack Tunney scheduled a battle royal, in which Ramon and Rick Martel were the final participants remaining. They faced each other on Monday Night Raw, and Ramon won the match and was awarded the title. Michaels claimed that he was the rightful holder of the belt and refused to acknowledge Ramon as the champion. Diesel was serving as Michaels' bodyguard but soon became an active wrestler and carried on Michaels' feud with Ramon. In the months leading up to Survivor Series, Ramon had also developed a feud with Jeff Jarrett, and the two faced each other several times with the Intercontinental Championship on the line. Ramon's friend, the 1-2-3 Kid, took Ramon's side in these feuds, and the two formed an occasional tag team. The Headshrinkers had also been feuding with Michaels and Diesel since dropping the WWF Tag Team Championship to them on August 28. The Headshrinkers had several rematches but were unable to regain the belts. Finally, Davey Boy Smith was involved in a feud with his real-life brother-in-law Owen Hart and Hart's other brother-in-law, Jim Neidhart. Owen Hart had turned on his brother Bret at the 1994 Royal Rumble, after which Smith got involved on Bret's side and Neidhart took Owen's side.
Although Jerry Lawler and Doink the Clown had a storyline rivalry that dated back to when Doink turned on Lawler by dumping a bucket of water on him following SummerSlam 1993, the feud had rarely been mentioned since then. On the September 10, 1994 episode of "WWF Superstars of Wrestling", however, Lawler provoked Doink by popping balloons carried by Doink's midget sidekick Dink. The rivalry soon led to Lawler introducing a midget named Queasy, who dressed like Lawler. Doink and Lawler then introduced several more midgets over the following weeks. An elimination match was booked for Survivor Series, with Lawler, Queasy, Sleazy and Cheesy facing Doink, Dink, Wink and Pink.
Bret Hart's feud with Bob Backlund dated back to the July 30, 1994 episode of "WWF Superstars of Wrestling". Backlund believed that he had won the match and the WWF Championship by defeating Hart. The match had not ended, however, and Hart pinned Backlund. When Hart tried to shake Backlund's hand after the match, Backlund turned on him and performed the crossface chickenwing on Hart. Following the match, Backlund acted quite differently than he had when he portrayed a face. He claimed that he had never truly been beaten for the WWF Championship on December 26, 1983, as the match ended when his manager, Arnold Skaaland, threw a towel into the ring rather than allowing Backlund to submit to the Iron Sheik's camel clutch. A submission match was booked between Hart and Backlund for Survivor Series with the stipulation that the match could only end when a wrestler's cornerman threw a towel in to the ring. Hart's cornerman was his real-life brother-in-law Davey Boy Smith. Backlund's cornerman was Bret's brother Owen Hart, who had a long rivalry with Bret since turning on him during a tag team match at the 1994 Royal Rumble.
The central feud in the match between Guts & Glory and The Million Dollar Team was between Lex Luger and Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation. During 1994, DiBiase had "purchased" the contracts of several wrestlers to form a heel stable. Among the members to join were Bam Bam Bigelow and King Kong Bundy. Prior to SummerSlam 1994, DiBiase claimed to have added Luger to the group. Luger denied having joined, despite Tatanka claiming that he had evidence that Luger had "sold out" to DiBiase. Luger and Tatanka faced each other at SummerSlam, where it was revealed that the storyline was a swerve, as Tatanka turned on Luger to join the Million Dollar Corporation. Bigelow and Adam Bomb had also been feuding since the September 10, 1994 episode of "Superstars of Wrestling". Bigelow attacked his opponent, a jobber, before the match. DiBiase then claimed that the company was not providing suitable competition, and he challenged any wrestler to face Bigelow. Bomb responded, and the two brawled briefly. Leading up to Survivor Series, Bomb and Bigelow faced each other at several house shows. The Heavenly Bodies were not members of DiBiase's stable, but they competed on behalf of the group. At the time, they were involved in a feud with The Smokin' Gunns as a result of a match on the September 3 episode of "Superstars of Wrestling". The Heavenly Bodies attacked the Gunns prior to the match and stole the Gunns' cowboy hats. They put on the hats to mock the Gunns and then threw them on the ground and stomped on them. To get revenge, the Gunns stole The Heavenly Bodies' ring robes and tore the wings off them.
The feud between The Undertaker and Yokozuna began at Survivor Series 1993. During an elimination match, Yokozuna was unable to injure The Undertaker, despite slamming The Undertaker's head into the ring steps and performing the Banzai drop on him. A match was booked for Royal Rumble 1994, in which The Undertaker would challenge WWF Champion Yokozuna for the title in a Casket match. During the match, which featured a no-disqualification clause, Mr. Fuji, Yokozuna's manager, hired nine other wrestlers to interfere on Yokozuna's behalf. Yokozuna won the match after opening The Undertaker's urn, which, according to the storyline, contained the secret to The Undertaker's powers. After the match, The Undertaker appeared on the video screen and vowed to return to the World Wrestling Federation one day. He was not seen for several months, although, in reality, he was taking time off wrestling to allow injuries to heal. The Undertaker returned at SummerSlam 1994, defeating an impostor pretending to be The Undertaker. A rematch against Yokozuna was scheduled for Survivor Series. This was also to be a Casket match, but Chuck Norris was brought in as a special outside referee to prevent interference.
Event.
The first match of the event saw The Bad Guys, which consisted of Razor Ramon, the 1-2-3 Kid, the Davey Boy Smith, and The Headshrinkers (Sione and Fatu) versus The Teamsters, composed of Diesel, Shawn Michaels, Jeff Jarrett, Owen Hart, and Jim Neidhart. The opening minutes of the match featured brothers-in-law Hart and Smith trading moves as well as Jarrett and Ramon brawling. Fatu became the first wrestler eliminated after Diesel performed a Jackknife powerbomb on him. Diesel eliminated the 1-2-3 Kid forty-two seconds later after another Jackknife powerbomb. Sione followed thirty-one seconds later after being pinned by Diesel. Davey Boy Smith entered the ring, but Diesel soon knocked him between the ropes to the arena floor. Hart and Neidhart prevented Smith from getting back in the ring, and Smith was eliminated after the referee counted him out. Razor Ramon was left as the only member of his team to face the five members of The Teamsters. He fought with Diesel for several minutes, but Diesel then performed the Jackknife powerbomb on him and prepared to pin him for the victory. Michaels insisted on having Diesel hold Ramon while Michaels performed a superkick on their opponent. Ramon dodged the kick, and Michaels kicked Diesel in the face. Diesel became angry at Michaels, particularly because the same mistake had cost Diesel the Intercontinental Championship at SummerSlam. He and Michaels argued outside the ring while the rest of the team attempted to calm them down. The referee counted all five wrestlers out of the ring and declared Razor Ramon the winner of the match. Shawn Michaels was shown backstage after the match, and he stated that he was disbanding his tag team with Diesel and vacating the Tag Team Championship. He then got into a car and drove away from the arena.
The match between Jerry Lawler's team, known as The Royal Family (with Queasy, Sleazy, and Cheesy), and Doink's Clowns R' Us team (with Dink, Wink, and Pink) consisted of comedic action for much of the first ten minutes. Eventually, Doink attempted a crossbody, but Lawler reversed the move. He was able to pin Doink and eliminate him from the match. Lawler remained involved in the match and played a role in the elimination of two more members of Doink's team. When Wink attempted a monkey flip against Queasy, Lawler blocked the move and helped Queasy to pin Wink. Later in the match, Lawler threw Cheesy on top of Pink, which enabled Cheesy to eliminate another of Doink's teammates. After Wink and Pink were eliminated, however, they hid under the ring rather than returning backstage. The final member of Clowns R' Us was eliminated after Sleazy and Dink fought in the ring. Dink performed a crossbody on Sleazy and attempted to pin him. Queasy rolled the wrestlers over so that Sleazy was on top, however, and the referee made the three count and awarded the match to The Royal Family. As Queasy, Sleazy and Cheesy celebrated after the match, Lawler criticized them for taking credit for the victory. All six midgets turned against Lawler and chased him away from the ring. As Lawler tried to escape, Doink returned and hit him in the face with a pie.
The next match was the submission match between champion Bret Hart and challenger Bob Backlund. The rules stated that the match would end when a wrestler's cornerman (Owen Hart for Backlund or Davey Boy Smith for Bret) threw a towel into the ring. Bret got the early advantage and wore down Backlund using head locks, but Backlund broke free and attempted a crossface chickenwing on Bret. Bret escaped, but Backlund maintained the advantage by attacking Bret's arm and attempting another crossface chickenwing. Bret used a figure four leglock on Backlund, but Backlund got out of the hold. Bret then used the sharpshooter, his signature hold, on Backlund. Owen entered the ring and clotheslined Bret from behind to break the hold. Smith chased Owen around the ring but fell and was kayfabe knocked unconscious on the ring steps. While Bret was distracted, Backlund applied the crossface chickenwing. Owen appeared concerned for his brother, and he begged his parents, Stu and Helen Hart, to throw Bret's towel in to the ring. After Bret had been in the hold for several minutes, Helen threw in the towel to give Backlund the victory. Owen showed that his concern was not genuine by celebrating Bret's loss as Backlund was awarded the WWF Championship.
The team of Guts and Glory, consisting of Lex Luger, Adam Bomb, Mabel, and The Smoking Gunns (Billy and Bart Gunn), faced The Million Dollar Team, made up of Tatanka, Bam Bam Bigelow, King Kong Bundy, and The Heavenly Bodies (Tom Prichard and Jimmy Del Ray) in the next match. Guts and Glory took the early lead when Mabel pinned Prichard after performing a crossbody from the second rope. Mabel fought Bundy and Bigelow, but he was counted out after clotheslining Bigelow out of the ring. Bigelow then performed a moonsault on Bomb and got a pinfall. Luger and Del Ray fought back and forth until Luger performed a running forearm smash on Del Ray to get the pinfall. The Smokin' Gunns were eliminated next, as Tatanka pinned Bart and Bundy pinned Billy. Luger fought back by pinning Tatanka with a small package. Seven seconds later, Bundy pinned Luger after performing a splash to get the victory. Bundy, Bigelow, and Tatanka continued to attack Luger after the match until Luger's team returned to the ring to save him.
The main event was next, featuring The Undertaker versus Yokozuna in a casket match with Chuck Norris as the special outside referee. The Undertaker gained the early advantage, but Yokozuna reversed the momentum with a Samoan drop. He tried to put The Undertaker in the casket, but The Undertaker fought back. Yokozuna next performed a leg drop and placed The Undertaker in the casket. Before Yokozuna could close the lid, however, The Undertaker attacked him and the two wrestlers fought while standing in the casket. The Undertaker performed a clothesline from the top rope and placed Yokozuna in the casket. King Kong Bundy and Bam Bam Bigelow came down the aisle toward the ring, but Chuck Norris blocked their path. While Norris was distracted, however, Irwin R. Schyster entered the ring from the other side and attacked The Undertaker. He placed The Undertaker in the casket, but The Undertaker recovered before Yokozuna could close the lid. Jeff Jarrett tried to interfere on Yokozuna's behalf, but Norris stopped him with a superkick. The Undertaker performed a DDT and a big boot on Yokozuna. He then rolled his opponent in to the casket and closed the lid to gain the victory.
Aftermath.
Shortly after Survivor Series Diesel was named the top contender to Backlund's title and took him in a title defense at a Madison Square Garden live show three days after Survivor Series. Diesel won the match in eight seconds to become the new WWF Champion. With the victory over Backlund Diesel became a Triple Crown Champion. Hart returned at the Royal Rumble in January 1995, where he faced Diesel to try to regain his title. Backlund interfered in the match, restarting the rivalry and leading to an I Quit match at WrestleMania XI. Hart won the match by using the crossface chickenwing to make Backlund concede defeat.
To fill the vacancy created when Diesel and Michaels broke up, an eight team tournament was announced with the finals scheduled for the Royal Rumble. The 1-2-3 Kid and Bob Holly won the tournament by defeating Tatanka and Bam Bam Bigelow and won the titles but dropped the belts the following night to The Smoking Gunns.
A feud began between Michaels and Diesel at the Royal RumbIe when Michaels attacked Diesel during his match and became the top contender for the WWF Championship by winning the 1995 Royal Rumble match. Diesel won their match at WrestleMania after Sid, Michaels' new bodyguard, accidentally distracted the referee. Diesel offered Michaels a rematch, and Michaels told Sid that his services would not be required during the rematch. Sid attacked Michaels, and Diesel came to Michaels' defense. This attack caused Michaels to turn face, and he and Diesel resumed their friendship and won the WWF Tag Team Championship later in 1995.
Lex Luger's feud with the Million Dollar Corporation did not continue, as the Corporation targeted The Undertaker. The Undertaker spent most of the following year feuding with the Corporation, as he faced IRS at the 1995 Royal Rumble, King Kong Bundy at WrestleMania XI, and Kama at SummerSlam 1995. Luger was placed in a tag team with Davey Boy Smith known as The Allied Powers, but the team never won the tag team titles and was on the verge of breaking up when Luger bolted for World Championship Wrestling in September 1995.
Yokozuna did not regain his main event status after Survivor Series. After taking some time off, he made a surprise return at WrestleMania XI as Owen Hart's partner in a tag team title match against the Smoking Gunns. Yokozuna and Hart won the WWF Tag Team Championship, and Owen's feud with Bret was dropped. The brothers eventually reunited in 1997 to form The Hart Foundation, a stable that also included Davey Boy Smith and Jim Neidhart.

Survivor Series (1995)

Survivor Series (1995) was the ninth annual Survivor Series pay-per-view professional wrestling event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It was sponsored by the Milton Bradley Company. It took place on November 19, 1995 at the USAir Arena in Landover, Maryland, and was the first Survivor Series program not to take place on either Thanksgiving Eve or Thanksgiving night.
The main event was a No Disqualification match for the WWF Championship. Hart won the title from Diesel by pinfall.
The undercard featured Shawn Michaels, Ahmed Johnson, British Bulldog and Sycho Sid versus Yokozuna, Owen Hart, Razor Ramon and Dean Douglas in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match, The Darkside (The Undertaker, Savio Vega, Fatu and Henry Godwinn) versus The Royals (King Mabel, Jerry Lawler, Isaac Yankem and Hunter Hearst Helmsley) in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match, Goldust versus Bam Bam Bigelow and Bertha Faye, Aja Kong, Tomoko Watanabe and Lioness Asuka versus Alundra Blayze, Kyoko Inoue, Sakie Hasegawa and Chaparita Asari in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match and The BodyDonnas (Skip, Rad Radford, Tom Prichard and 1-2-3 Kid) versus The Underdogs (Marty Jannetty, Hakushi, Barry Horowitz and Bob Holly) in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match.
Background.
Survivor Series featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing feuds, plots, and storylines that were played out on "Monday Night Raw"—World Wrestling Federation's (WWF) flagship television program. Wrestlers portrayed a villain or a hero as they followed a series of events that built tension, and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.
The main rivalry heading into the event was between Diesel and Bret Hart over the WWF Championship. At In Your House 4, Hart served as the guest commentator during Diesel's title defense against British Bulldog. Hart interfered in the match by attacking Bulldog. As a result, Diesel was disqualified and thus retained the title. This angered Diesel and he argued with Hart, resulting in the two brawling with each other. As a result of the circumstances, on October 30 edition of "Raw", the WWF President Gorilla Monsoon signed a WWF Championship match between Diesel and Hart to take place at Survivor Series. Diesel and Hart had faced off for the title two times before, at the 1994 King of the Ring (which Diesel won by disqualification), and the 1995 Royal Rumble (which ended in a draw due to outside interference). With those two matches both ending in disqualifications, Monsoon added a No Disqualification stipulation to this rematch.
Another predominant rivalry heading into the event was over the Wildcard Survivor Series elimination match, pitting Shawn Michaels, British Bulldog, Ahmed Johnson and Sycho Sid against Razor Ramon, Owen Hart, Yokozuna and Dean Douglas. On October 23 edition of "Raw", the WWF President Gorilla Monsoon made the match to make rivals team with each other and teammates compete against each other, since Bulldog was Camp Cornette teammate of Hart and Yokozuna. Ramon and Douglas had been feuding with each other since September 11 edition of "Raw" when Douglas interfered in Ramon's match with British Bulldog. At In Your House 3, Douglas defeated Ramon in a standard wrestling match. On September 25 edition of "Raw", Douglas was made the #1 contender for Shawn Michaels' WWF Intercontinental Championship. A week before their match at In Your House 4, Michaels had been attacked in a club in Syracuse, New York. As a result, at In Your House 4, Michaels forfeited the title to Douglas. However, Douglas was forced to defend his newly won title against Ramon, who defeated Douglas for the title. Michaels and Sid's rivalry dated back to February 20 edition of "Raw", when Michaels introduced Sid as his new bodyguard for his WWF Championship title shot against Diesel at WrestleMania XI. However, despite Sid's interference, Michaels was defeated by Diesel. As a result, on April 3 edition of "Raw", Michaels informed Sid that he was no more needed. Sid became angry and he attacked Michaels, putting Michaels out of action for six weeks. This led to an Intercontinental Championship match between Michaels and Sid on September 11 edition of "Raw", which Michaels retained by defeating Sid.
The rivalry between The Darkside (The Undertaker, Savio Vega, Fatu and Henry Godwinn) and The Royals (King Mabel, Jerry Lawler, Isaac Yankem and Hunter Hearst Helmsley) dated back to the annual King of the Ring tournament, when Mabel defeated Undertaker in the quarter-final round. On September 25 edition of "Raw", King Mabel interfered in Undertaker's match with British Bulldog, setting up a match between Undertaker and King Mabel at In Your House 4. However, on October 9 edition of "Raw", King Mabel attacked Undertaker during a Six-man tag team match pitting Diesel, Shawn Michaels and Undertaker against Bulldog, Owen Hart and Yokozuna. Due to the attack, Undertaker was sidelined and was replaced by Yokozuna as King Mabel's opponent. On November 6 edition of "Raw", it was announced that Undertaker's The Darkside team would compete against King Mabel's The Royals team in a Survivor Series elimination match at Survivor Series.
Goldust made his WWF debut at In Your House 4, defeating Marty Jannetty. On November 4 edition of "Superstars", Bam Bam Bigelow interrupted an interview of Goldust, setting up a match between Bigelow and Goldust at Survivor Series.
Event.
Before the event aired live on pay-per-view, Smoking Gunns (Billy and Bart) defeated Public Enemy (Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge) in a non-televised match.
Preliminary matches.
As the event concluded, the first match that aired was a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match between The Underdogs (Marty Jannetty, Hakushi, Barry Horowitz and Bob Holly) and The BodyDonnas (Skip, Rad Radford, Tom Prichard and 1-2-3 Kid). Kid substituted for Jean-Pierre Lafitte on the BodyDonnas team and Holly substituted for Avatar on the Underdogs team. Underdogs scored the first elimination when Holly performed a Flying Crossbody on Prichard. Skip then eliminated Holly by pinning him with a roll-up. Kid performed a Spinning Heel Kick on Hakushi, allowing Radford to pin him for the elimination. BodyDonnas suffered the next elimination when Horowitz pinned Radford with a Small Package. Kid performed a Snap Legdrop on Horowitz for the elimination. Jannetty then eliminated Skip by performing a Superbomb. Jannetty had dominated the match as he climbed the top rope to perform a high-flying move on Kid, but Kid's manager Ted DiBiase distracted the referee, allowing Kid's Million Dollar Corporation teammate Sycho Sid interfere in the match and drop Jannetty to the ring. Kid then pinned Jannetty to win the match and become the survivor from BodyDonnas team.
The second match was a four-on-four women's Survivor Series elimination match pitting the WWF Women's Champion Alundra Blayze, Kyoko Inoue, Sakie Hasegawa and Chaparita Asari against Bertha Faye, Aja Kong, Tomoko Watanabe and Lioness Asuka. Blayze made the first elimination when she pinned Asuka after performing a German Suplex. Kong then dominated the match as she eliminated Hasegawa by performing a Belly to Back Suplex, Asari by performing a Diving Splash and Inoue by performing a Diving Seated Senton, which she called "Banzai Drop". Blayze then dominated the opposing team as she eliminated Watanabe by performing a Piledriver and then eliminated opposing leader Faye by performing a Bridging German Suplex. Kong then performed an Uraken Punch on Blayze to win the match and become the survivor from Bertha Faye's team.
The next match was a standard wrestling match between Bam Bam Bigelow and Goldust. Goldust controlled most of the match against Bigelow while Bigelow performed poorly throughout the match and did not perform any high-impact moves that jeopardized his character during the match. Goldust eventually avoided a Corner Clothesline by Bigelow and performed a Running Bulldog to win the match.
The fourth match was a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match pitting The Darkside (The Undertaker, Savio Vega, Fatu and Henry Godwinn) against The Royals (King Mabel, Jerry Lawler, Isaac Yankem and Hunter Hearst Helmsley). Undertaker controlled most of the match as he dominated Royals and made the first elimination by pinning Lawler after a Reverse Belly to Belly Piledriver, which he calls "Tombstone Piledriver". Undertaker eliminated Yankem next in the same way by performing a Tombstone Piledriver. Helmsley had to compete against Undertaker but he opted to escape the match. As he left the ring, he was chased to the ring by Godwinn, who came out to the ring with his slop bucket. As a result, Helmsley climbed the apron. Undertaker eliminated Helmsley by performing a Chokeslam from apron to the other side of the ring. Mabel dominated Undertaker by performing a Belly to Belly Suplex and a Legdrop. However, Undertaker immediately sat up which scared Mabel and he escaped the ring and got counted out. As a result, Darkside won the match with the entire team surviving.
Main event matches.
The final match on the undercard was a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match pitting Shawn Michaels, Ahmed Johnson, British Bulldog and Sycho Sid against Yokozuna, Owen Hart, the WWF Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon and Dean Douglas. The tension arose between the two teams as heroes and villains were randomly distributed in both teams and the match was dubbed Wildcard match. The heroes and villains fought their own teammates as Ramon attacked his own teammate Douglas, allowing Michaels to eliminate him by pinning him with a roll-up. Sid was next on Michaels' team to dominate Ramon and grabbed him for Michaels to perform a Superkick, which Michaels called "Sweet Chin Music". Michaels tried to hit the move but Ramon ducked and Sid was hit instead, allowing Ramon to pin Sid for the elimination. Sid retaliated by performing a Powerbomb on Michaels. Johnson would then control the match as he eliminated Hart by performing a Sitout Double Underhook Powerbomb, which he called "Pearl River Plunge". Ramon battled for his team and performed a Crucifix Powerbomb on Johnson, which he called "Razor's Edge". However, Bulldog tagged Johnson which meant that Johnson could not be eliminated. Ramon was distracted by Sycho Sid, 1-2-3 Kid and Ted DiBiase, allowing Bulldog to perform a Running Powerslam for the elimination. Yokozuna battled the opposing team as he was the remaining member on his team. Johnson powerslammed Yokozuna and tried to pin him but Bulldog broke up the pin to save his ally. This caused Michaels and Johnson to attack Bulldog. Michaels then performed a Sweet Chin Music on Yokozuna and Johnson performed a Diving Splash on Yokozuna to win the match. Michaels, Johnson and Bulldog survived on their team.
The main event was a No Disqualification match for the WWF Championship. Diesel defended the title against Bret Hart. As the match started, both wrestlers each untied a top turnbuckle. Hart focused on Diesel's knee and mainly attacked there. The action spilled to the outside where Diesel dominated Hart until the two returned to the ring, where Diesel tried to perform a Release Powerbomb, which he called "Jackknife Powerbomb" but Hart attacked Diesel's knee to get himself out of the move. Hart applied a Figure Four Leglock on Diesel and then attempted to apply his submission maneuver Sharpshooter but Diesel attacked Hart's face and kicked him into the exposed corner. The match went back and forth with Hart mainly focusing on Diesel's knee. The action spilled to the outside where both men attacked each other until Diesel rolled Hart into the ring and tried to perform a Jackknife Powerbomb but Hart was almost knocked out and collapsed. Diesel tried to pick him up again for the Jackknife Powerbomb but Hart pinned Diesel with a Small Package to win the match and the WWF Championship. This angered Diesel and he hit two Jackknife Powerbombs on Hart after the match.
Aftermath.
Several departures took place after Survivor Series. Bam Bam Bigelow left WWF after losing to Goldust at Survivor Series and joined ECW in 1995. The WWF Women's Champion Alundra Blayze was booked for a rivalry against Aja Kong. On November 27 edition of "Raw", Kong and Tomoko Watanabe defeated Blayze and Kyoko Inoue in a tag team match. It would turn out to be Blayze's last appearance in WWF as she made a shocking appearance on December 18 edition of "WCW Monday Nitro" and dropped the Women's Championship into a trashcan.
On November 6 edition of "Raw", it had been announced by Camp Cornette's lawyer Clarence Mason that the winner of the WWF Championship match between Diesel and Bret Hart at Survivor Series would defend the title against British Bulldog. Since Hart won the title at Survivor Series, a title match was set up between Hart and Bulldog at . At In Your House 5, Hart defeated Bulldog to retain the WWF title.
Following the Survivor Series matchup, Diesel became a "tweener" saying that he would accept the support of fans who liked him, but didn't care about the fans that didn't. This attitude remained until shortly before In Your House 6 when Diesel lost a steel cage match against Bret Hart due to interference by the The Undertaker. Not long after, Diesel broke ties with Shawn Michaels and remained a "heel" for the remainder of his WWF run. 
Since 1-2-3 Kid had turned on Razor Ramon during his match against Sycho Sid by helping Sid win the match and join Million Dollar Corporation on November 13 edition of "Raw", Ramon and Kid began a rivalry. Marty Jannetty also got involved in the rivalry as he was screwed out of the victory against 1-2-3 Kid at Survivor Series during Underdogs versus BodyDonnas match. On November 20 edition of "Raw", Jannetty tried to attack Kid and his manager Ted DiBiase but received a Powerbomb by Sid. On November 27 edition of "Raw", it was announced that Ramon and Jannetty would compete against Kid and Sid in a tag team match at In Your House 5. At In Your House 5, Ramon and Jannetty defeated Kid and Sid when Ramon pinned Sid.

Stet (novel)

Stet is a novel by the American author James Chapman; it was published by Fugue State Press in 2006.
Plot summary.
"Stet" tells the life story of a visionary Soviet filmmaker named Stet who lives through Stalin's repressions, manages to direct his first feature film, but ends up in a prison camp for various offenses against the bureaucracy.
The novel is narrated in a "Russian" voice, by an ostensible third-person narrator who is nevertheless full of opinions and bitter aphorisms. Despite his third-person status, the narrator seems to be a major character in the book.
The tone of the book is black humor, and often entirely pessimistic, as it delineates the difficulties of living as an artist who does not accept or worry about the judgments of his surrounding world. Yet the character of the filmmaker Stet, to whom aesthetic ecstasy remains available throughout his trials, seems to give the reader an alternative to the pessimism of the narrator.

Survivor Series (1997)

Survivor Series (1997) was the eleventh annual Survivor Series pay-per-view professional wrestling event produced by the World Wrestling Federation. It was the third consecutive Survivor Series presented by Milton Bradley's Karate Fighters, and took place on November 9, 1997 at the Molson Centre in Montreal, Quebec. The tagline "Gang Rulz" refers to the various wrestling stables that feuded with each other coming to this event.
The main event was a standard wrestling match for the WWF Championship, in which Bret Hart defended the title against Shawn Michaels. It would be the last of three WWF Championship matches between the two, who had previously headlined the 1992 Survivor Series and WrestleMania XII together. Michaels won the title in controversial fashion when Vince McMahon ordered match referee Earl Hebner to end the match as Michaels held Hart in Hart's own finishing maneuver, the Sharpshooter, even though Hart had not submitted. This incident became known as the Montreal Screwjob and marked Hart's last appearance on WWE programming until 2005, and his last in-ring appearance until 2010. This was also the last time that Hart held a title in WWE until May 2010, and the last time he headlined a WWE pay-per-view until SummerSlam 2010.
The undercard featured Stone Cold Steve Austin versus Owen Hart in a standard wrestling match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship, Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal), Ahmed Johnson and Ken Shamrock versus Nation of Domination (The Rock, Faarooq, Kama Mustafa and D'Lo Brown) in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match, Kane versus Mankind in a standard wrestling match, Team Canada (The British Bulldog, Jim Neidhart, Doug Furnas and Phil Lafon) versus Team USA (Vader, Goldust, Marc Mero and Steve Blackman) in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match, Truth Commission (The Jackyl, The Interrogator, Sniper, and Recon) versus Disciples of Apocalypse (Crush, Chainz, 8-Ball and Skull) in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match and New Age Outlaws (Billy Gunn and Road Dogg) and The Godwinns (Henry and Phineas) versus The Headbangers (Mosh and Thrasher) and The New Blackjacks (Blackjack Windham and Blackjack Bradshaw) in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match.

<doc id="5943168" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5943168" title="Fort de l'Île Sainte-Hélène">
Fort de l'Île Sainte-Hélène

The Fort de l'Île Sainte-Hélène, a historic site on Saint Helen's Island that belongs to the city of Montreal, Quebec, was constructed in the early 1820s as an arsenal in the defensive chain of forts built to protect Canada from a threat of American invasion. Although not heavily fortified, it served an important purpose as the central artillery depot for all forts west. These included Fort Henry and Fort Lennox. The red stone used to build the Fort is a breccia quarried on the island, which is situated in the St. Lawrence River between the island of Montreal and the south shore.
The Levis Tower, contrary to popular belief, was not part of the fortifications on the island. It was built in the 1930s to house a water tower.
History.
Built in 1820-1824 by the British, the fort served as arsenal and a storage facility for weapons and equipment. It was transformed into a military prison after the rebellions of 1837. The complex was however ravaged by fire in 1848, only to be rebuilt in 1863-1864.
After the British Army left the fort for ruin, it became part of the City of Montreal. In the 1930s, it was restored as part of a job creation project during the Great Depression. During the Second World War, it was used as an internment camp for Italian Canadians. During the summer months the Fort houses two reconstituted 18th century regiments, The Olde 78th Fraser Highlanders, and Les Compagnies Franches de la Marine.
Today the Fort is also home the David M. Stewart Museum, an institution founded in 1955 to collect, store and display historical artefacts from Canada's colonial past, particularly that of New France. The museum collections include artefacts dating from the 16th century through to the 19th century. Both the Fort and the museum are open year-round.
David M. Stewart Museum.
The museum, housed inside the garrison features a permanent exhibition and an annual one, usually opened in the spring months. During the summer months, the museum plays host to reconstituted 18th century regiments that perform daily military maneuvers. The regiments, the Olde 78th Fraser Highlanders and Les Compagnies Franches de la Marine perform daily musket drills, fife and drum and bagpipe shows. A 19th century Royal Artillery regiment, the 4th brigade, is planned to be added. In 2011, the museum underwent significant renovations indoors that also resulted in the addition of a glass staircase and elevator to access the three floors of the museum.
The noon day gun salute is a tradition that was originally undertaken by British troops stationed at the fort. It use was to act as a form of synchronization for the city. The cannon fire signaled noon solar time. This tradition had been continued by museum staff dressed in the regimental dress of the Royal Artillery until the museum underwent renovations; it is uncertain whether the tradition will return.
Prior to the renovations, an encampment had also been set up next to the parade square simulating 18th century colonial life in New France. Bread was baked in a wood-fired oven daily as well as children's crafts and games were set up to give a hands-on approach to education of life during the 18th century. The encampment, as the noon day gun, may not return as a result of regulations of Parc Jean Drapeau rules against fires such as those used by the baker in the encampment.

Survivor Series (1998)

Survivor Series (1998) was the twelfth annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It was presented by Nestlé Crunch and took place on November 15, 1998 at the Kiel Center in St. Louis, Missouri.
Fourteen professional wrestling matches were scheduled on the event's card, a noticeably higher number than most pay-per-view events because the main focus of the card was a tournament for the vacant WWF Championship titled "Deadly Game". It was the first tournament held with the WWF Championship on the line in ten years, the last being at WrestleMania IV. Both tournaments were 14-man tournaments instead of the regular 8 or 16-man tournaments. Aside from the tournament, two other championship matches occurred: the first defense of the WWF Women's Championship since it had been reactivated and a triple threat tag team match for the WWF Tag Team Championship.
This event was also the first Survivor Series not to feature the traditional Survivor Series elimination-style tag team match, although the notion of survival is apparent in the knockout tournament. The only other time a Survivor Series event has not featured the traditional match is in 2002 but did feature the inaugural Elimination Chamber match, a match type also based on survival.
Background.
As the central focus of Survivor Series was the Deadly Games tournament, the build up involved many interlinking feuds. Arguably the cause of the tournament goes back to WrestleMania XIV in March, where Steve Austin won the WWF Championship. Austin's working class, blue collar style and manner clashed with WWF Chairman Mr. McMahon and his corporate notions of who he wanted to represent his company. He then set about trying to mould a challenger in his own image to dethrone Austin. Firstly he brought back Dude Love, though he soon abandoned his hippy style gimmick in favor of a suit - even wearing his false teeth (Foley was known for his scruffy look, including various missing teeth from a variety of hardcore matches). After two attempts, including one with McMahon as referee, Love still did not recover the gold and seemed to bring about more woe to McMahon. McMahon turned to Paul Bearer and sought about setting up his son Kane in a match at June's King of the Ring which Austin lost but only thanks to interference from Kane's (fictional) half-brother The Undertaker who, despite having animosity towards his brother, did not want to see him hurt - Austin won his title back the following evening. Having been thrown to the wayside by McMahon, Love returned to his psychologically fragile alter-ego Mankind, soon changing his dress from rags to an unintentionally scruffy parody of his father-figure McMahon. Both Mankind and Kane formed an ad-hoc tag team which McMahon sponsored in a bid to take on Undertaker, who had been defending Austin while similarly vying for a title shot. Shortly before August pay-per-view SummerSlam, it was revealed that Undertaker and Kane had been in cahoots. Austin retained the title at SummerSlam, but McMahon was not done. At the , he forced Austin to face both Kane and Undertaker in a match that essentially became a handicap match after McMahon added the stipulation that the brothers could not pin each other. Austin lost the championship, but since he was simultaneously pinned by Kane and Undertaker the title was held up. To rectify the situation, McMahon booked a match between the two brothers at . To further mock Steve Austin, he was designated as referee and McMahon threatened to fire him if he didn't perform his duties. Austin defied the order and attacked Undertaker after he had turned on Kane with Paul Bearer once again rejoining him and attacked Kane with a steel chair, then counted both brothers out because he wouldn't allow Undertaker to become the World Wrestling Federation Champion due to inference from Paul Bearer and declared himself the winner and champion. McMahon then made good on his threat to fire Austin, and the title was left vacant. To rectify this, Deadly Game was set up, a knock-out tournament contest between a wide array of wrestlers in the company.
Despite being fired, Austin was at "Raw Is War" the night after Judgment Day and held McMahon hostage at gunpoint, though when Austin went to fire his gun it turned out to be a joke gun, with a sign saying "BANG! 3:16 on it"; Austin left the ring when McMahon soiled himself, having given him a piece of paper. Austin revealed the following week that the paper was a five-year contract that guaranteed him a championship match and most shockingly of all, the contract had been signed by Mr McMahon's son Shane, who had his owner rights suspended by his father and was demoted to a referee.
As well as Austin, McMahon seemed to have a new target of hatred. On the November 2 edition of "Raw Is War", McMahon declared to the self-styled People's Champion that because he had a problem with the people, he had a problem with The Rock. He then ordered Rock into an Intercontinental match with Ken Shamrock, with Rock's tournament spot on the line. Shamrock hit him with a chair and thus he won, but only by disqualification and thus lost his tournament spot. Afterwards McMahon had The Rock arrested, much like he had done months before with Austin. The following week McMahon threatened him with expulsion from the company if he could not win a match against former Nation of Domination stable mate Mark Henry. Despite the odds being stacked in his favor with McMahon's entourage at ring side distracting the referee, Shane McMahon ran down after Rock had performed the Rock Bottom, a lifting side slam, on Henry and counted the pinfall to secure Rock's employment and, presumably, earning back his spot in the tournament although this was never specifically mentioned other than McMahon mentioning it on Heat.
While many wrestlers became the target of Vince McMahon's ire, one wrestler returned to being his favorite. With his son ostensibly turning on him, Mankind tried to cheer McMahon up and was treated as a surrogate child. McMahon awarded him a new belt, the WWF Hardcore Championship, as well as giving him a makeover, including a pedicure, haircut and tailored suit, gearing him up to win the tournament. As well as being a Hardcore Champion, Mankind had formed an ad hoc tag team with Al Snow, the humorous duo mocking each other's mascots who they talked to, Mr. Socko and Head. In a tag team match Mr. Socko went missing and it later transpired that Mr. McMahon had wrapped it round Al Snow's Head in order to provoke his wrath. Snow himself had also had several run-ins with Jeff Jarrett, after Jarrett had opened his guitar case only to find Head inside, instead of his trademark weapon.
Family problems were abound elsewhere with the return of Paul Bearer at Judgment Day. Bearer had been at Kane's side ever since his debut the previous October, but when Kane and Undertaker created an allegiance to take down Austin, Kane turned his back on Bearer and allowed Undertaker to beat him. When Bearer returned he seemed to be on Kane's side, but in fact he gave a chair to Undertaker to strike his son with, revealing on Raw that he had returned to being Undertaker's mentor.
Steven Regal had been having vignettes airing for his return for weeks under the gimmick of 'a man's man' but when he did make his appearance known, it was by attacking the European Champion X-Pac from behind on the October 26 edition of "Raw Is War". Another wrestler would make his debut standing by Mr. McMahon's side as a masked man in a SWAT style uniform, defending him from Austin's attacks. The enforcer turned out to be the returning Big Boss Man, after a stint in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), who had taken on the role of personal bodyguard for McMahon.
The two other feuds going into the event were both championship feuds. Marc Mero grew jealous of his valet Sable and the attention she gained, eventually having her fired by defeating her in a match. When she returned as a wrestler in her own right, Mero employed a new valet Jacqueline and the two naturally squared off. Firstly they had a bikini contest, which Sable won by popularity, but was disqualified as her bikini consisted of handprints. The two then had an arm wrestling contest, which ended with Jacqueline cracking the bikini contest trophy over the head of Sable. When Sable revealed the Women's Championship had been reactivated, the two met for a match on Raw, in which Jacqueline won due to Mero holding Sable's legs down. Sable was further humiliated when Jacqueline cut a piece of her hair and wrapped it into her own hair, but appeared on "Raw Is War", October 26, to demand a championship match.
The Headbangers had met the New Age Outlaws the previous month and after dominating most of the match, won via disqualification when the Road Dogg broke a boombox over Mosh's head. Despite titles not changing hands by disqualification, the Headbangers began to declare themselves champions, coming to the ring with toy replica belts and parodying New Age Outlaws pre-match speeches. With the dissolution of The Nation, D'Lo Brown and Mark Henry stayed together as a tag team and with Brown's feud with X-Pac over the European title, by messing with one D-Generate, he picked an unwitting fight with the Outlaws too.
Event.
First Round.
The opening match was part of the Deadly Game tournament and saw Mr. McMahon welcome Mankind to the ring, he then announced his mystery opponent as a WWF veteran who had a record setting win-loss record before jumping ship to WCW. The grandiose introduction turned out to be ironic, though, as his opponent was the jobber Duane Gill. Despite the ten minute time limit, designed to make sure matches began swiftly, the match barely lasted one minute as Mankind knocked Gill to the floor and rolled him up for a pin.
Al Snow's match against Jeff Jarrett began with Snow following Jarret's valet, Debra McMichael but soon entered the ring. Snow took the first advantage, using the ropes to aid him with a neckbreaker but mistiming a flying leg drop. A succession of reversed pin counts from both parties ensued with neither wrestler winning, turning into a DDT from Snow. With both men on the mat, Debra walked onto the apron with Snow's mannequin head to distract the referee and allow Jarrett to pick it up. Snow himself grabbed Jarrett's guitar and swung for Jarrett, but missed and received Head. Jarrett went to attack him again in the corner but a kick from Snow allowed him to grab the Head and smack into it Jarrett's face, allowing a victory via pinfall when the referee finally looked back. Snow would face Mankind in the quarter finals.
Big Boss Man met Steve Austin on the walkway for their fight, with Austin throwing Boss Man into the steel steps before the match was officially under way. Inside the ring Boss Man used his punches to subdue Austin before choking him in the middle of the ring. Crowd support inspired Austin to fight back with a clothesline, shoulder barging his opponent into the turnbuckle before stomping a mudhole. After being Irish whipped against the ropes, Boss Man escaped the ring and when Austin caught up with him, he was met with a night stick from the Boss Man. The referee awarded the match via disqualification to Austin but that did not stop the onslaught from Boss Man's nightstick, much to the delight of Mr. McMahon.
The fourth Deadly Games match, between European Champion X-Pac and Stephen Regal, saw X-Pac's fast paced style take advantage over Regal until a mistimed bronco buster in the corner left X-Pac in pain, Regal pulling him out to fit a seated abdominal stretch on him. Regal's mat-based technical style kept X-Pac slowed down and without much of his arsenal. Having slowed X-Pac down, Regal ventured to the top rope with his opponent, utilizing a double-underhook suplex from the top turnbuckle to put pressure on X-Pac's fragile neck. Despite picking up some offense, X-Pac went for a top rope maneuver too quickly and Regal shook the ropes, causing him to fall off to the outside. Regal quickly followed with a double underhook suplex reversed into a suplex from X-Pac. The bell was rung as both men were counted out but McMahon sent out Commissioner Slaughter to restart the match with a five minute time limit; however X-Pac was already halfway up the ramp, nursing his neck injury and amidst confusion it appeared the match would not be restarted, giving Steve Austin a bye through to the semi-finals.
The next match, between Ken Shamrock and Goldust, began as a high-speed encounter with both wrestlers making many running attacks, until Shamrock had Goldust on the floor at which point he began to use a chin lock to slow him down. Goldust regained some momentum after standing up and, although Shamrock was able to reverse it initially Goldust soon had some advantage in the match. Things changed though when Goldust set his opponent up for the illegal move, Shattered Dreams. As Goldust made the run up, the referee jumped in the way to prevent the low blow which gave Shamrock the time to jump up to the top rope, jumping onto Goldust for a hurricarana, following it up immediately with an ankle lock that made Goldust tap out.
The last of the matches from the first round had The Rock booked against a returning Triple H. Despite Triple H's D-Generation X music playing, Pat Patterson and Gerald Brisco came to the ring to make the announcement that despite a no-show from Triple H, presumably due to his knee injury, the match would not be forfeited. The last minute replacement was Big Boss Man who ran to the ring, only to be rolled into a pin for the shortest match in WWF history - four seconds.
Quarter Finals.
The first of the quarter final matches, which saw the time limit increased to fifteen minutes, was between two wrestlers who received byes through the first round, the warring brothers Undertaker and Kane. Both threw each other around the ring before the match was taken briefly outside, Undertaker thrown into the crowd barrier and Kane stomped into the steel steps. Although Kane would retake the advantage in the ring, a jumping elbow drop met with the mat when Undertaker set up. Undertaker used the opportunity to take out Kane's knee, using a number of attacks and holds on it. Undertaker pushed the rules to the limit by choking Kane in the corner and as the referee reprimanded him, Kane was able to recuperate to fight back. After a series of punches and a flying lariat the two were even again, this was symbolised when Undertaker grabbed Kane's throat for a chokeslam from a running attack. Kane did the same and eventually was able to deliver the chokeslam. Before he could pin his brother though, Paul Bearer jumped on the apron to distract Kane and in the interim period Undertaker stood up to deliver a tombstone piledriver and pin his brother, with Bearer holding Kane's leg down.
Mankind met Al Snow next, with Snow throwing Mankind around the ring and barging him to the floor before dropkicking him to the outside. Mankind tried to balance things by grabbing a steel chair but Snow took it off him and hit him twice (without disqualification), before mistiming an attack to the ring post allowing for Mankind to take charge. Having been beaten in the ring, Snow crawled to Head to use as a weapon but swung and missed, allowing Mankind to deliver a back drop. As he did, Head came away in his hand and he realized Mr. Socko was tied round Head's head. The rage saw him beat the mannequin, stamping on it before turning his attention back to Al Snow to land a double-armed DDT and then the mandible claw to win the match and setting up a match for Steve Austin in the next round.
The final second round match was between the long-feuding Shamrock and The Rock. Rock began his attack instantly, punching and clotheslining Shamrock before the latter replied with a suplex. Rock was not down for long, coming out of a kneeling position with another clothesline before chasing Shamrock out of the ring and spitting water into his face but receiving steel steps in the shoulder for it. Big Boss Man came to the ring as Shamrock moved from a chin lock into his ankle lock. Rock held on and slowly crawled for the ring break. After breaking away both men collided with a double clothesline allowing both men to recover and, after a failed pin attempt, stand up and fight again. Rock dynamically swung around Shamrock's body to secure a DDT attempt and as Boss Man distracted the referee, punched Shamrock in the crotch. Despite this, and a People's Elbow, Shamrock still kicked out and managed to reverse a Rock Bottom attempt into a belly-to-belly suplex. Boss Man tried to interfere again, slyly throwing a night stick to Shamrock as the referee was distracted. Rock intercepted the night stick though, allowing him to strike down Shamrock and make a pinfall.
The Deadly Game had a hiatus, roughly halfway through the evening, for the Women's Championship match between Jacqueline and the challenger Sable. The match seemed to be over almost instantly as, after a flurry of strikes Sable used the TKO on Jacqueline. Marc Mero, though, pulled Sable away from the pinfall for which he received a Sable Bomb on the outside of the ring allowing Jacqueline to recover and attack her from behind, rolling her back into the ring and taunting Sable with the hair Jacqueline had cut a few weeks before. Sable was then taken to the corner and kicked before being set up for a powerbomb. Sable tossed the champion over her back but Jacqueline crawled her over to the corner to set up a tornado DDT from the turnbuckle. Sable reversed again, throwing Jacqueline to the ground, picking her up to deliver a Sable Bomb and winning the Women's Championship.
Semi Finals.
The first semi-final between Corporate sponsored Mankind and fan-favorite Steve Austin started with a brawl more than wrestling; Mankind threw off his tuxedo jacket as the two exchanged rough punches until Austin landed in the corner at which point Mankind began to bite him before landing a knee drop into his face and using his shoe as a weapon. After receiving a Lou Thesz press and a stunner attempt, Mankind ran away but McMahon's cronies, who were at ringside caught up with him and stopped him. Austin caught him from behind with a clothesline and the two fought in and out of the ring with referee Mike Chioda reluctant to count out or disqualify either wrestler. As the two met back in the ring, they grappled so much that Mankind's shirt came out of his trousers, resembling more and more his old appearance by the time a double clothesline floored both wrestlers. Mankind was thrown a chair from the outside but as he ran it into Stone Cold, Austin put his foot up, kicking Mankind through the chair. Still, Mankind was unabated delivering a double-armed DDT onto the chair and when that would not keep Austin down, he tried a piledriver on the chair but Austin ran him forward then tossed him over his back so that he landed on the chair. He picked him up and executed a Stone Cold Stunner on the chair too and as he made what seemed to be the inevitable victory, McMahon jumped out of his wheelchair and pulled the referee out of the ring, punching him to the ground and kicking him. With Austin looking on in shock, Mankind applied the mandible claw but as his trousers fell down he had trouble maintaining balance. Austin threw him into the ropes and caught another stunner, covering him despite there being no referee; suddenly Shane McMahon ran down the ramp and slid into the ring counting, but then stopping suddenly at two and as Austin looked up, Shane sat up on his knees and gave Austin the finger. Gerald Brisco and Slaughter climbed in the ring and hit Austin with a chair, then Shane counted the pinfall advancing Mankind into the final. McMahon's entourage sped off quickly, jumping into a limousine and being followed by Austin.
The second semi-final between The Rock and The Undertaker was fought initially around ringside, mostly a series of punches and headbutts until Rock was thrown back into the ring. The Rock was pummeled by a series of strikes and throat punches from Undertaker that eventually left him tied up in the ropes. From this position he was able to toss Undertaker out of the ring and followed him, fighting in the crowd eventually. Back in the ring there was still no discernible advantage, both exchanging punches and The Rock delivering a Samoan Drop. As the two lay motionless on the mat, Big Boss Man came back to ringside, apparently having not left with the rest of McMahon's entourage. He stopped Rock from finishing the People's Elbow by grabbing at his foot, allowing Undertaker to take Rock down, though Undertaker struck Boss Man from the apron. As Undertaker set up The Rock for a chokeslam, Kane climbed in the ring and Undertaker threw The Rock into Kane's hands, with Kane delivering a chokeslam to The Rock. This gave The Rock a win via disqualification and he advanced onto the final as Undertaker and Kane fought through the crowd.
The tournament took a hiatus again for the WWF Tag Team Championship triple threat match which saw 'Bad Ass' Billy Gunn and D'Lo Brown fight with Mosh trying to steal a pinfall. Billy Gunn let Brown and Mosh fight while he tagged in Road Dogg, although this amounted to little as the New Age Outlaws threw both Headbangers out the ring and took a ten-punch to Brown and Henry. Both Headbangers returned to double team Road Dogg and the match was resumed proper with Mosh and Brown both attempting pins on Road Dogg and then teaming up on him, changing partners to continue the onslaught until Brown threw out Road Dogg and turned on Mosh, managing a frankensteiner on him but soon falling fowl to a Russian leg sweep. When Road Dogg returned he took the brunt of assault again and as he was down Brown's running powerbomb on Mosh was reversed into a sunset flip like pin. Both changed partners again, with the Headbangers double teaming Road Dogg but not helping Brown to double team them and instead delivering a low blow but without securing a pinfall. As their alliance failed, Road Dogg crawled to tag in the yet unused Billy Gunn, whose hot tag saw him take down everybody until Brown caught him from a running momentum to land a Lo Down which strangely referee Tim White delayed his pin count. After Billy Gunn kicked out, he jumped on a running Mosh to land the Fameasser and then a piledriver to retain the championship with a pin victory.
Final.
The final round of the Deadly Game tournament for the vacant WWF Championship began slowly, with The Rock and Mankind trying to gauge each other. Both wrestlers secured takedowns or the other before Mankind slowed down the match with a sleeper hold on Rock. At this point Mr McMahon and Shane, who had faked their escape from the arena to rid themselves of Austin, walked down to ringside. Rock fought his way back to his feet in the sleeper hold and backdropped Mankind, before tossing him outside the ring. He then reversed a suplex with one of his own before dropping Mankind's crotch onto the crowd barrier. Both wrestlers returned to the ring briefly, only for Mankind to Cactus Clothesline them back out to the announce tables where Mankind grabbed a steel chair and floored The Rock, with referee Earl Hebner not disqualifying him. Mankind then picked up the steel steps and went to drop them on Rock but was met with a chair shot through the steps, causing them to drop the steps on himself and Rock unleashed a myriad of chair shots on the steps into Mankind. The match turned dirtier when it returned to the ring, with Mankind desperately low blowing The Rock and then following it up by biting Rock's face, again with the referee not ending it. As The Rock crawled outside of the ring to escape the biting, Mankind followed him and pushed him onto the announce table, continuing to bite him and landing a leg drop. He could not make Rock lay down for three in the ring though and after another sleeper hold, Rock began to fight back with a flurry of punches and reversing Mankind's back toss into a DDT. With Rock thrown out the ring, Mankind tried to elbow drop him from the second rope but ended up going through the Spanish announce table on his own. After using bits of the table to hit Mankind, he was thrown back into the ring and kicked out of the People's Elbow, managing to find his own finisher in a double-armed DDT from a running Rock, and then the mandible claw. Staying upright, Rock managed to jump into the Rock Bottom. Rock then, much to the vocal surprise of the crowd, grabbed Mankind's legs and fixed him in the sharpshooter, using the top rope for leverage. Just like at Survivor Series the year before, without tapping out, Mr McMahon ordered the referee to ring the bell and award the WWF Championship to The Rock: a reference to the Montreal Screwjob
After the match, Mr. McMahon and Shane entered the ring with Mr. McMahon telling the audience how he had successfully screwed Steve Austin, Mankind and the people. When Mankind asked for an explanation, Rock delivered another Rock Bottom but as the three of them celebrated, Austin ran into the ring and was met with a beating from The Rock that he eventually fought back from, tossing Rock out of the ring before grabbing the Championship belt and throwing it on Rock. He then gave a stunner to the just-recovered Mankind as the pay-per-view ended.
Aftermath.
The immediate effects of the event, alongside The Rock turning heel by aligning himself with McMahon, was the creation of The Corporation. The following evening on Raw, McMahon declared The Rock to be the Corporate Champion and set about persuading other wrestlers down the roster to join with the promise of money and power. The first to join was Ken Shamrock, who demanded a match with the Big Boss Man for interfering in his match, but towards the end of the match both McMahons came to the ring and convinced him to join. They also tried to convince the New Age Outlaws to join, but after feigning an allegiance they revealed to be true to D-Generation X and had to defend their Tag Team Titles at and again the following night, which they lost after much interference. McMahon also introduced a new commissioner, Shawn Michaels, who also showed Corporate bias before returning to his DX stable. In the following year The Corporation would become a large stable and would rival The Undertaker's Ministry of Darkness.
On a more individual basis, Mankind's outrage at being screwed by Mr. McMahon led him to a title match at the subsequent pay-per-view, Rock Bottom. Despite winning the match, McMahon managed to manipulate the rules to make sure The Rock retained his title again but another match on the first Raw of the new year saw Mankind win the title, leading to an "I Quit" match at the Royal Rumble in the new year, a match that became both noted as an entertaining match and also as being focused on in the "Beyond the Mat" documentary. This led to an empty arena match, a Last Man Standing match and finally a Ladder Match, with the title frequently changing hands until ultimately The Rock was champion and would go on to WrestleMania XV, with Mankind finding his way into the main event as a special guest referee.
Austin and Mr. McMahon's feud continued to escalate after he was cheated in the semi-finals. The following night on Raw he reminded McMahon and The Rock that when he was rehired by Shane, he was guaranteed a title match. The match was marred with interference though both from Corporate members, Mankind trying to find revenge on The Rock and The Undertaker who took a shovel to Austin. McMahon tried to use Undertaker as another blockade for Austin, setting him in a Buried Alive Match to prevent him entering the Rumble. Austin won the Buried Alive Match and was placed in the Royal Rumble entering first opposite McMahon at number two who went on to win the Rumble, Austin reclaimed his WrestleMania place the following month, though and went on to win the title.
X-Pac's neck injury was not mentioned on screen and Steven Regal left the company soon after for WCW, without making another appearance. Marc Mero would also disappear from programming, firstly to support his wife, Sable, in her career before leaving the company altogether. Firstly he split with Jacqueline, blaming her for his losing streak and she went on to form Pretty Mean Sisters; then in a moment of cockiness he announced that he was so insulted by being forced to face Duane Gill that he would quit if he lost. Thanks to interference from the debuting Blue Meanie, Duane Gill (who had become Light Heavyweight Champion) won the match and Mero quit, making one last appearance at UK's Capital Carnage. Sable would disappear until the new year, when she became an active defender of the Women's Championship; fighting the likes of Luna Vachon and newcomer Tori and forming an alliance with Nicole Bass.

Coolidge Homestead

The Coolidge Homestead, also known as Calvin Coolidge Homestead District or President Calvin Coolidge State Historical Site, was the childhood home of the thirtieth President of the United States, Calvin Coolidge and the place where he took the presidential oath of office. Located in Plymouth Notch, Vermont, Coolidge lived there from age four in 1876 to 1887, when he departed for Black River Academy for education.
History.
The home, itself, was bought by his father, John Coolidge, who expanded the home from a simple -story farm house to its present size and appearance today. 
Despite living most of his life in Northampton, Massachusetts, Coolidge often returned to the homestead to visit his family and was staying there when President Warren G. Harding, died. Coolidge was sworn in by his father in the family parlor after taking the Oath of Office for the presidency. Due to his father's refusal to modernize the house, it remains to this day in the same condition, and in some cases with the same furnishings, as it was the night Coolidge took the oath. The Inaugural Room itself is behind glass, but a visitor can stand in an alcove and see the lamp, Bible, and table that were used in the ceremony, all placed in their historic positions. 
The Homestead District includes:
The district was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965.
Today, the Coolidge Homestead is part of the Calvin Coolidge State Historical Site overseen by the state of Vermont. As far as possible the buildings have been returned to the conditions they were in when Coolidge was president. A simple video and picture display of his life is shown in the barn. The rooms in Coolidge Hall that he used as a Summer White House in 1924 have been restored and a video of contemporary newsreel film added.
It is located west and north of Vermont Route 100A in Plymouth Notch, and open daily from 9:30 A.M. to 5:00 P.M, late May to mid-October. Directly across the road from the buildings are the Coolidge family graves. Four generations of the family, including the President, are buried here. The Calvin Coolidge State Park, a developed part of the Coolidge State Forest, is also close by.

Survivor Series (1999)

Survivor Series (1999) was the thirteenth annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It was presented by Rent-A-Center, and took place on November 14, 1999 at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan.
The main event was a Triple Threat match–a non-elimination match involving three wrestlers against each other; for the WWF Championship between Triple H, The Big Show and The Rock. The Big Show won the title. He was a replacement for Stone Cold Steve Austin, who had been run down by a car earlier in the night (which was an angle for Austin to take time to recover from his injuries).
The undercard featured New Age Outlaws (Mr. Ass and Road Dogg) versus Al Snow and Mankind for the WWF Tag Team Championship, Edge and Christian and Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff) versus Too Cool (Grand Master Sexay and Scotty 2 Hotty) and The Hollys (Hardcore and Crash) in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match, Chyna versus Chris Jericho for the WWF Intercontinental Championship, The Big Show versus The Big Boss Man, Prince Albert, Mideon and Viscera in a one-on-four Survivor Series elimination match, Kane versus X-Pac, Mae Young, The Fabulous Moolah, Tori and Debra versus Ivory, Luna, Jacqueline and Terri Runnels in an eight-woman tag team match, Val Venis, Mark Henry, Gangrel and Steve Blackman versus The British Bulldog and Mean Street Posse (Rodney, Pete Gas and Joey Abs) in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match, Olympic Gold Medalist Kurt Angle in his WWF in-ring debut against Shawn Stasiak and The Godfather, D'Lo Brown and The Headbangers (Mosh and Thrasher) versus Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von) and Acolytes Protection Agency (Faarooq and Bradshaw) in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination tag team match.
Background.
Survivor Series featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing feuds, plots, and storylines that were played out on "Raw is War" and "SmackDown"—World Wrestling Federation's (WWF) television programs. Wrestlers portrayed a villain or a hero as they followed a series of events that built tension, and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.
The main rivalry heading into the event was between Triple H, Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock over the WWF Championship. At No Mercy, Rock defeated British Bulldog in a standard wrestling match. Later that night, Rock challenged the winner of the WWF Championship Anything Goes match between Triple H and Stone Cold Steve Austin for the title. After issuing the challenge, Rock was attacked by Triple H with a sledgehammer. Later that night, Triple H defeated Austin to retain the title. On the October 18, 1999 episode of "Raw is War", Rock challenged Triple H to a match for the title at Survivor Series, because Rock was angered at the previous night's attack. Austin also issued a challenge and claimed that he deserved a title shot instead of Rock. The WWF Chairman Vince McMahon solved the situation by making a Triple Threat match between Triple H, Austin and Rock for the WWF Championship.
Another predominant rivalry heading into the event was between New Age Outlaws (Mr. Ass and Road Dogg) and Al Snow and Mankind for the WWF Tag Team Championship. On the October 18 episode of "Raw is War", Mick Foley gave his Rock 'n' Sock Connection partner Rock, a copy of his book """". However, later that night, the same copy was discovered by Al Snow in a trashcan. He informed Foley about it. Foley confronted Rock about it. Rock denied doing so but Foley broke up the Rock 'n' Sock Connection. Later that night, Foley cost Rock and himself, the Tag Team Championship against The Hollys (Hardcore and Crash) by coming out for the match without wearing Mankind gear and leaving Rock to wrestle on his own. This allowed Hollys to defeat Rock and win the titles. On the October 21 episode of "SmackDown", Mankind and Rock had a match which ended in a disqualification when Val Venis interfered and attacked Mankind with his book. On October 25 episode of "Raw is War", Mankind wrestled Triple H for the WWF Championship. Triple H was disqualified when Venis assaulted Mankind again, earning Mankind, a disqualification win. However, Al Snow came out to rescue Mankind from the assault. On the October 28 episode of "SmackDown", Mankind defeated Venis after distraction from Snow. As a result, Mankind and Snow formed a tag team. On the November 4 episode of "SmackDown", Mankind and Snow defeated The Hollys to win the Tag Team Championship. On November 8 episode of "Raw is War", New Age Outlaws defeated Mankind and Snow for the Tag Team Championship. This led to a title match between New Age Outlaws and Mankind and Snow for the Tag Team Championship.
At No Mercy, Chyna defeated Jeff Jarrett in a Good Housekeeping match to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship. On the October 18 episode of "Raw is War", Chyna issued an open challenge to any wrestler for the Intercontinental Championship. Chris Jericho answered the challenge and insulted Chyna, prompting Chyna to attack him. After weeks of involvement by Stevie Richards in Chyna and Jericho's rivalry, it was announced by Jericho on the November 8 episode of "Raw is War" that he would wrestle Chyna for the Intercontinental Championship at Survivor Series.
On the October 18 episode of "Raw is War", Big Boss Man challenged The Big Show to a match and agreed to defend the WWF Hardcore Championship. The Big Show accepted the challenge. However, before the match occurred, The Big Show was told by a police officer that his father had died (in storyline). As a result, The Big Show left the arena to check on his father. It was later revealed to be a plan of Boss Man and the police officer. On the October 21 episode of "SmackDown", an enraged The Big Show attempted to attack Boss Man but Boss Man escaped. The Big Show then assaulted the police officer. On the October 25 episode of "Raw is War", Boss Man distracted The Big Show during his match with Prince Albert. Albert attacked The Big Show from behind and Boss Man broke The Big Show's father's watch with a hammer. As a result, Boss Man and Albert formed a new alliance. On the October 28 episode of "SmackDown", Al Snow had a match with Boss Man. However, Boss Man's ally, Albert continuously interfered in the match and the two attacked Snow, leading him to challenge both men to a Hardcore match in the parking lot. Later that night, Boss Man and Albert went to the parking lot to wrestle Snow but instead of Snow, The Big Show appeared. He trapped Boss Man and Albert in a car and smashed it into pieces and pushed a dumpster on the top of the car. On the November 1 episode of "Raw is War", Boss Man and Albert interrupted an interview of The Big Show and attacked him. On the November 8 episode of "Raw is War", a tribute was paid to The Big Show's father on his death. Boss Man came out and insulted The Big Show and his father. On the November 11 episode of "SmackDown", a footage was shown of The Big Show's father's funeral, in which Boss Man interrupted the funeral and ruined it by attacking The Big Show and ruining his father's grave. This led to a Survivor Series match between a team captained by The Big Show and a team captained by Boss Man. The Big Show's team consisted of Kai En Tai (Funaki and Taka Michinoku) and Blue Meanie and Boss Man's team consisted of Prince Albert, Viscera and Mideon. On the November 14 episode of "Sunday Night Heat", The Big Show attacked all of his team members and was the only remaining member of his team, making it a 4-on-1 Survivor Series match.
At No Mercy, the New Brood (Matt and Jeff Hardy) defeated Edge and Christian in a Ladder match, which was the final round match of a tournament, in which the winning team earned the managerial services of Terri Runnels and received $100,000. However, on the October 18 episode of "Raw is War", New Brood announced that they were no longer part of Gangrel's faction and turned into fan favorites. They reverted their tag team name back to Hardy Boyz. Edge and Christian ended their rivalry with Hardy Boyz by showing them respect and formed an alliance with Hardy Boyz. On the October 21 episode of "SmackDown", The Hollys defeated Hardy Boyz to retain the WWF Tag Team Championship. On the October 25 episode of "Raw is War", Hollys defended the Tag Team Championship against Edge and Christian. Edge and Christian had almost won the match until Too Cool (Grand Master Sexay and Scotty Too Hotty) returned and interfered in the match, costing Edge and Christian, their title shot. Hardy Boyz came out to rescue Edge and Christian and the four wrestlers cleared the ring of Too Cool and Hollys. This led to the formation of a villainous alliance of Too Cool and Hollys. As a result, the teams of Edge and Christian and Hardy Boyz began a rivalry with Too Cool and Hollys, as the four teams battled each other in several tag team matches and standard wrestling matches, leading to a Survivor Series match at Survivor Series.
On the October 18 episode of "Raw is War", The Headbangers (Mosh and Thrasher) distracted Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von) during their match against X-Pac and Kane, costing Dudley Boyz, the match. On the October 25 episode of "Raw is War", Dudley Boyz made fun of The Godfather's hos for being attacked by Viscera, after Viscera defeated Godfather in a "Winner Takes Hos" match. The following week on "Raw is War", The Headbangers defeated Dudley Boyz in a tag team match. On the November 11 episode of "SmackDown", Dudley Boyz defeated Godfather and D'Lo Brown. It led to a Survivor Series match pitting Dudley Boyz and Acolytes Protection Agency (Faarooq and Bradshaw) against Headbangers, Godfather and Brown.
At No Mercy, X-Pac defeated Kane, Faarooq and Bradshaw in a Four Corners Elimination match. As a result of losing to X-Pac, Kane started showing jealousy towards X-Pac and their team started to breakup. On the October 28 episode of "SmackDown", X-Pac betrayed Kane during a tag team match against Dudley Boyz by low blowing Kane and allowing Dudley Boyz to pin Kane for the win. After the match, X-Pac proclaimed that Kane did not deserve to be a member of D-Generation X, a faction that X-Pac was a part of during that time. On the November 1 episode of "Raw is War", the entirety of DX attacked Kane during a match between Kane and X-Pac. This led to a match between Kane and X-Pac at Survivor Series.
At No Mercy, Mae Young helped her friend The Fabulous Moolah in defeating Ivory to win the WWF Women's Championship. On the October 21 episode of "SmackDown", Moolah defended the Women's Championship against Young, but Ivory interfered in the match and attacked both Moolah and Young. Jacqueline and Luna joined Ivory in the assault and Tori came out and joined Young and Moolah. On the October 25 episode of "Raw is War", Moolah decided to vacate her title and retire from professional wrestling. However, Ivory reminded Moolah of her rematch clause and easily defeated Moolah for the Women's Championship. On the November 11 episode of "SmackDown", it was announced that the team of Ivory, Jacqueline, Luna and Terri Runnels would wrestle the team of Moolah, Young, Tori and Debra at Survivor Series.
Throughout November 1999, vignettes aired that hyped the WWF debut of Kurt Angle who represented the United States in the 1996 Summer Olympics and won the gold medal in heavyweight freestyle wrestling. It was announced that Angle would make his WWF debut at Survivor Series.
Event.
Preliminary matches.
The first match that aired live on the pay-per-view was a Four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match pitting Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von) and Acolytes Protection Agency (Faarooq and Bradshaw) against The Godfather, D'Lo Brown and The Headbangers (Mosh and Thrasher). Godfather's team suffered the first elimination when Bradshaw pinned Thrasher after performing a Clothesline from Hell. Mosh was eliminated next when Dudley Boyz performed a 3D. APA and Dudley Boyz suffered their first elimination when Bradshaw was disqualified for hitting Brown with a steel chair. D-Von took advantage and tried to pin Brown but Faarooq broke up the pin because he wanted to make the pinfall himself. As a result, Faarooq and D-Von started brawling outside the ring and were counted-out. Bubba Ray was the remaining member of APA and Dudley Boyz and was double-teamed when Godfather performed a Ho Train, followed by Brown performing a Lo Down on Bubba Ray for the victory. As a result, Godfather and Brown became the survivors of their team.
The second match was a standard wrestling match between Kurt Angle and Shawn Stasiak. This match was Angle's in-ring debut in WWF. Stasiak dominated much of the earlier match until Angle escaped the ring and insulted the fans by telling them not to insult an Olympic Gold Medalist. However, Stasiak beat on Angle and then climbed the top rope to perform a Diving Splash but Angle got up and caught a flying Stasiak by performing an Olympic Slam for the victory.
The third match was a Survivor Series elimination match, in which British Bulldog and Mean Street Posse (Rodney, Pete Gas, and Joey Abs) competed against Val Venis, Mark Henry, Gangrel, and Steve Blackman. Blackman made the first elimination by performing a Martial Arts Kick on Pete Gas. Gangrel then eliminated Rodney by performing The Impaler. Mean Street Posse was totally eliminated when Henry performed a Big Splash on Joey Abs. As a result, Bulldog was the only member on his team. He started dominating the match and eliminated Gangrel by performing a Superplex. Bulldog next eliminated Blackman by performing a Fisherman Suplex. Venis and Henry started double-teaming Bulldog as Henry splashed Bulldog and Venis performed a Money Shot, on Bulldog for the victory. As a result, Venis and Henry were the survivors on their team.
The fourth match was an eight-woman tag team match pitting Ivory, Luna, Jacqueline and Terri Runnels against Mae Young, The Fabulous Moolah Tori and Debra. The match went back and forth with both female teams fighting each other. The match came to its end when Moolah performed a Scoop Slam on Ivory and splashed her to win the match.
The fifth match was a standard wrestling match between Kane and X-Pac. When Kane entered the ring and his entrance pyros were going off, X-Pac did not wait for him and quickly attacked him but Kane easily started dominating the match. Kane climbed the top rope but X-Pac dropkicked him outside the ring. The action quickly returned to the ring where X-Pac performed three consecutive Spinning Heel Kicks on Kane and then attempted to perform a Bronco Buster on Kane in the ropes but Kane avoided it. Kane then climbed the top rope and performed a Flying Clothesline on X-Pac before following it by performing a Chokeslam and attempted to pin X-Pac, but X-Pac's D-Generation X teammate Road Dogg interfered in the match by pulling Kane's foot. Kane, however, rolled into the ring where X-Pac performed a X-Factor on Kane and started attacking him, but Kane threw X-Pac away. Kane eventually attempted to perform a Tombstone Piledriver,but Triple H interfered and hit Kane in the face with a belt. Kane was then placed in the corner as Tori ran to the ring to stop X-Pac's Bronco Buster. She was kicked in the face as Kane fought off all of the DX members to rescue her.
After the match, The Rock was trying to give an interview but Triple H interrupted the interview and attacked Rock. As a result, Rock and Triple H started brawling until they were separated by several WWF officials. The next match was a Handicap Survivor Series match pitting Big Boss Man, Prince Albert, Mideon, and Viscera against The Big Show. The Big Show was the only member on his team because he had attacked all of his teammates prior to the event. However, he single-handedly dominated the match when he chokeslammed Mideon at the 18-second mark for the first elimination. The Big Show next eliminated Prince Albert by performing a Chokeslam at the 30-second mark. Viscera was next eliminated by The Big Show at the 55-second mark. Due to The Big Show having eliminated all of Big Boss Man's teammates within a minute, Boss Man chose not to wrestle The Big Show and left the ring and ran to the backstage. He got counted-out. As a result, The Big Show won the match and ran after Boss Man to the backstage.
After the match, Stone Cold Steve Austin was being interviewed but Triple H also interrupted this interview, like he had done to Rock, moments ago. Austin started chasing Triple H in the backstage area until a car drove up and ran down Austin at high speed. The WWF Chairman Vince McMahon confronted Triple H, D-Generation X, and WWF's head of security, Jim Dawson but Triple H claimed that he was not to be blamed because he did not do such thing. WWF officials loaded Austin into the ambulance and Austin was removed from the WWF Championship match against Triple H and Rock.
Main event matches.
The sixth match was a standard wrestling match between Chyna and Chris Jericho for the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Chyna and Jericho immediately started attacking each other when Jericho shoved down Chyna's manager Miss Kitty. Both women then kicked Jericho to the outside of the ring as Chyna jumped out and threw Jericho into the stairs. Jericho taunted and teased Miss Kitty throughout the match and even kissed her on one occasion. Kitty started fighting Jericho as Chyna fought back by performing a Spear on Jericho and then whipped him into the ring post. However, Jericho quickly gained momentum and brought Chyna to the ring to perform a Powerbomb to get a near-fall.

The Big Show took advantage and chokeslammed Triple H to win the match and thus became the new WWF Champion. This was also the sixth Survivor Series in a row that the WWF Championship changed hands.
Aftermath.
After The Big Show won the WWF Championship at Survivor Series, he continued his rivalry with The Big Boss Man. The next night on "Raw is War", Boss Man defeated The Rock in a Hardcore match, with help from Prince Albert, to become the number one contender for the WWF Championship. At the new December pay-per-view, Armageddon, The Big Show defeated Boss Man to retain the title.
Since Stone Cold Steve Austin was hit with a car, the WWF Chairman Vince McMahon continuously blamed Triple H and D-Generation X for the attack. On the November 18 episode of "SmackDown", DX assaulted McMahon's Corporate Stooges (Pat Patterson and Gerald Brisco). Sgt. Slaughter informed McMahon of the attack and told McMahon that Triple H had invited him to DX locker room. McMahon went to the locker room, where Triple H warned McMahon, not to make this personal. Later in the night, Triple H came down to the ring and blamed McMahon for his title loss at Survivor Series and then challenged McMahon to a match at Armageddon. Shortly after, a footage was shown of backstage where the McMahon family had fallen down the stairs. On the November 22 episode of "Raw is War", Vince destroyed a limousine carrying DX using his car. Although DX retreated, the limousine was destroyed. Later that night, the police officers arrested Vince for assaulting DX, and Triple H attacked him while he was handcuffed. Later that night, Triple H came down to the ring and accused Vince of attacking Austin at Survivor Series, but Shane McMahon interrupted to defend his father and informed Triple H that Vince would accept Triple H's challenge at Armageddon. On the November 29 episode of "Raw is War", a storyline wedding was scheduled to occur between Vince's daughter Stephanie McMahon and Test. The ceremony was interrupted by Triple H, who showed a video in which he and a drunk Stephanie had gotten married. On the December 2 episode of "SmackDown", Triple H announced that his match against Vince at Armagaddon would be a No Holds Barred match, and on the following episode of "Raw is War" a further stipulation was added to the match. If Vince won the match, Triple H and Stephanie's marriage would be annulled but if Triple H won, he would be granted a WWF Championship match. At Armageddon, Triple H defeated Vince in a No Holds Barred match, after Stephanie betrayed Vince and helped Triple H in finishing Vince with a sledgehammer. It was later revealed that Rikishi had run over Austin on Triple H's orders.

Survivor Series (2000)

Survivor Series (2000) was the fourteenth annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It was presented by 3DO's "Warriors of Might and Magic" and took place on November 19, 2000, at the Ice Palace in Tampa, Florida.
The main event was a No Disqualification match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Triple H. The match resulted in a no contest when the action spilled to the backstage area.
The undercard featured Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von) and Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff) versus Edge and Christian and Right to Censor (Bull Buchanan and The Goodfather) in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match, Kurt Angle versus The Undertaker for the WWF Championship, Ivory versus Lita for the WWF Women's Championship, The Rock versus Rikishi, William Regal versus Hardcore Holly for the WWF European Championship, Kane versus Chris Jericho, The Radicalz (Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, Eddie Guerrero and Perry Saturn) versus D-Generation X (Billy Gunn, Road Dogg, Chyna and K-Kwik) in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match and Steve Blackman, Crash Holly and Molly Holly versus T & A (Test and Albert) and Trish Stratus in a Six Person Mixed Tag match.
Background.
Survivor Series featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing feuds, plots, and storylines that were played out on "Raw is War" and "SmackDown"—World Wrestling Federation's (WWF) television programs. Wrestlers portrayed a villain or a hero as they followed a series of events that built tension, and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.
The main rivalry heading into the event was between Kurt Angle and The Undertaker over the WWF Championship. At No Mercy, Angle defeated The Rock in a No Disqualification match to win the WWF Championship. Undertaker returned to WWF on the October 30 edition of "Raw is War" after being absent since Unforgiven. On the November 9 edition of "SmackDown", Undertaker defeated Kane, Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho in a Four Corners match to become the #1 contender for the title at Survivor Series.
Another predominant rivalry heading into the event was between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Triple H. The rivalry dated back to previous year's Survivor Series, when Austin was run down by a car in the backstage area and was sidelined for one year. At No Mercy, Austin competed against Rikishi in a No Holds Barred match as it was Rikishi, who had run down Austin with the car at Survivor Series. On the November 6 edition of "Raw is War", Austin competed against Rikishi and Kurt Angle in a Handicap match. Austin was being double-teamed by Rikishi and Angle until Triple H came to his rescue and forced Angle and Rikishi to retreat. Triple H then assaulted Austin with the sledgehammer and was revealed as the mastermind behind Austin's attack as he wanted to protect his WWF Championship. On the November 9 edition of "SmackDown", the WWF Commissioner Mick Foley announced that Austin and Triple H would compete in a match at Survivor Series. At the event, the match was made a No Holds Barred match.
At No Mercy, Rikishi's interference accidentally cost The Rock, the WWF Championship against Kurt Angle. The next night on "Raw is War", Rikishi apologized to Rock for costing him the title and told him that it was just accidental but Rock did not forgive Rikishi. On the October 30 edition of "Raw is War", Rikishi attacked Rock after Rock won his #1 contender's match against Chris Jericho. Following the assault, Rikishi revealed that Rock knew about the attack and had given Rikishi, the keys of the truck to run down Stone Cold Steve Austin at previous year's Survivor Series. On the November 2 episode of "SmackDown", Rikishi cost Rock, a title shot for the WWF Championship against Kurt Angle. On the November 9 edition of "SmackDown", the WWF Commissioner Mick Foley announced that Rikishi and Rock would wrestle in a match at Survivor Series.
On the October 23 episode of "Raw is War", Chris Jericho accidentally dropped his coffee on Kane. This angered Kane and he knocked down Jericho through a nearby placed table. On the October 26 episode of "SmackDown", Kane interfered in Jericho's WWF Championship title shot against Kurt Angle and attacked Jericho, causing Angle to retain the title by getting disqualified. Jericho retaliated by costing Kane a WWF Hardcore Championship match against Steve Blackman on the November 6 episode of "Raw is War". This eventually set up a match between Kane and Jericho at Survivor Series.
At No Mercy, Eddie Guerrero cost Chyna and Mr. Ass, their tag team match against Right to Censor (Steven Richards and Val Venis). On the October 23 episode of "Raw is War", Mr. Ass defeated Venis in a standard wrestling match, despite interference by Right to Censor members. On the October 26 episode of "SmackDown", Chris Benoit and Dean Malenko defeated Triple H and Road Dogg in a tag team match after help by Perry Saturn. Later that night, The Rock, Chyna and Mr. Ass defeated Right to Censor in a six-person tag team match. On the October 30 episode of "Raw is War", Guerrero defeated Chyna to retain the WWF Intercontinental Championship and attacked her after the match, causing Mr. Ass to save her from the beating. Later that night, Billy Gunn lost a match to Steven Richards which meant that he could no longer use the name Mr. Ass. On the November 2 edition of "SmackDown", The Radicalz reunited when Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko and Perry Saturn helped Chris Benoit in defeating Triple H. On the November 6 episode of "Raw is War", D-Generation X also reunited as Triple H, Billy Gunn, Road Dogg and Chyna defeated The Radicalz. Later that night, Triple H turned into a villain as he was revealed to be the mastermind behind Stone Cold Steve Austin's attack and as a result, left DX. On the November 16 episode of "SmackDown", Road Dogg and his new partner K-Kwik defeated Malenko and Saturn in a tag team match. After the match, WWF Commissioner Mick Foley announced that DX and K-Kwik would compete against Radicalz in a Survivor Series match.

The second match was a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match pitting The Radicalz (Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, Eddie Guerrero and Perry Saturn) against D-Generation X (Billy Gunn, Road Dogg, Chyna and K-Kwik). The two teams battled it out as the match started. Radicalz scored the first elimination when Guerrero hit Chyna with the WWF Intercontinental Championship belt, allowing Saturn to pin her for the elimination. DX made the next elimination as Gunn performed a Sleeper Slam on Guerrero. Radicalz then took control of the match as Benoit eliminated K-Kwik by performing a Bridging German Suplex and then Saturn eliminated Road Dogg by performing a Northern Lights Suplex.

However, Gunn could not control the match for longer as Benoit and Saturn double-teamed him. Gunn tried to perform a Vertical Suplex on Benoit but Benoit countered it and attempted a pinfall. Saturn held Gunn's foot, allowing Benoit to score the pinfall. As a result, Benoit and Saturn survived the match.
The next match was a standard wrestling match between Kane and Chris Jericho. Jericho controlled the earlier part of the match by using his quickness against Kane's power but Kane eventually controlled his high-flying with his high-impact power moves.

The next match was a standard wrestling match between The Rock and Rikishi. Rock started attacking Rikishi before the match even started as he performed a Samoan Drop. Rock went to the ringside and grabbed a steel chair. He tried to hit Rikishi with it but the referee took it away from Rock. As Rock turned back, Rikishi performed a Savate Kick. Rikishi then focused on Rock's injured chest and mainly attacked on his chest. As the action continued, the referee was eventually knocked out. Rikishi tried to hit Rock with a sledgehammer but Rock took the sledgehammer and hit Rikishi with it and followed it with a Lifting Side Slam, which he called "Rock Bottom" and tried to pin Rikishi, but the referee was knocked out. As the referee recovered, Rikishi kicked out of the move. Rikishi dominated Rock by performing a Splash and a Stink Face. Rock, however regained control of the match by performing a Clothesline, a Samoan Drop and an Elbow Drop, which he called "People's Elbow" on Rikishi to win the match.

Main event matches.
The sixth match was a standard wrestling match for the WWF Women's Championship. Ivory defended the title against Lita. Early on in the contest, during an enziguri kick by Lita, one of Ivory's boots struck Lita's cheek, causing it to bleed heavily throughout the match. Ivory dominated much of the match, and towards the end Steven Richards came out and interfered on Ivory’s behalf. But when Richards and Ivory consulted outside the ring, Lita attacked both of them by flying over the top rope. Back in the ring, Lita tried to perform a Moonsault, which she called "Litasault" on Ivory but Richards dragged Ivory out of the ring. The referee was distracted by Richards.

The referee eventually ejected them from ringside, allowing Angle to focus on Undertaker's leg and mainly attacked his leg. Undertaker, however dominated Angle and eventually sent him over the top rope outside to the ring. Angle crawled under the ring to protect himself. Undertaker eventually pulled him out and dragged him into the ring to perform an Elevated Powerbomb, which he calls "Last Ride" and attempted a pinfall.

Survivor Series (2001)

Survivor Series (2001) was the fifteenth annual Survivor Series pay-per-view professional wrestling event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and presented by Microsoft's Xbox. It took place on November 18, 2001 at the Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina. It was also the last Survivor Series to be produced under the World Wrestling Federation branding, as the company world be forced to change its name several months later as the result of a verdict in the World Wildlife Fund's lawsuit against the company.
The 2001 edition of Survivor Series marked the end of The Invasion angle, which had dominated WWF storylines since March when Vince McMahon purchased World Championship Wrestling.
Background.
The event featured eight professional wrestling matches with outcomes predetermined by WWF script writers. The matches featured wrestlers portraying their characters in planned storylines that took place before, during and after the event.
The largest storyline that had pervaded the WWF in the preceding months was, as mentioned above, The Invasion, which came about due to the actual purchase of World Championship Wrestling by the WWF just prior to WrestleMania X-Seven. The storyline eventually grew into a WWF vs. WCW faction battle, and eventually Extreme Championship Wrestling became a part of the battle by joining forces with WCW to create The Alliance.
On the October 22, 2001 episode of "Raw", Vince and Linda McMahon challenged Shane and Stephanie McMahon to a "Winner Take All" match to determine the fate of both companies, with the winning side continuing to stay in business while the losing side would be forced to disband. However, Vince McMahon had to deal with multiple defections to the Alliance side, including Kurt Angle, as well as an increasingly heated feud between two of the WWF's biggest stars, The Rock and Chris Jericho, over the WCW Championship. Vince began spreading rumors to the Alliance that there was a mole within their faction. On an episode of "SmackDown!" before the Survivor Series, Steve Austin was the last man standing after both factions attacked each other in the ring. After that, Vince appeared on the entrance ramp and shared a smile with Austin, teasing that Austin would be the mole.
Aftermath.
The next night on "Raw", Vince McMahon announced that the WCW Championship held by The Rock had become unbranded due to the dissolution of the Alliance and would be referred to simply as the World Championship. Several Alliance members were allowed to keep their jobs. Christian, The Dudley Boyz, and Rob Van Dam all were holding championships following the Alliance's loss (Christian was the European Champion, the Dudleys were WWF Tag Team Champions, and Van Dam was the Hardcore Champion. In addition, Stacy Keibler was able to stay employed due to her status as the valet for the Dudleys and Test won a twenty-man battle royal at "Survivor Series" which earned him immunity from being fired for one calendar year. (Some have erroneously listed Tazz as being in the Alliance when "Survivor Series" took place; Tazz had turned on the Alliance on the edition of "SmackDown" that immediately preceded "Survivor Series" by choking out Paul Heyman with the Tazzmission.) McMahon also debuted the infamous "Kiss My Ass Club" that night, where he said that an Alliance member- in this case Alliance Commissioner William Regal - would have to literally kiss his ass to keep his job.
At the very top of the show, Paul Heyman was the first Alliance member fired. Furious over being fired, Heyman lunged at his now-former broadcast partner Jim Ross, who was jeering him from the broadcast booth. The audience delighted in seeing Ross pummel Heyman before he was carted off by security. To replace him, Jerry Lawler was brought back, making his first appearance since his resignation from the company in the end of February after No Way Out. The Alliance co-owners, Shane and Stephanie McMahon, were called to the ring to answer for what they did. While Shane accepted his defeat and walked away, Stephanie tried to plead for her job, but was escorted from the ring by WWF security per orders by the WWF chairman Vince McMahon.
Based on his actions at the end of the WWF vs. Alliance Survivor Series match, for the majority of "Raw" Kurt Angle went around the backstage area portraying himself as the man who saved the WWF and wanting to be praised for doing so. Instead of that, Angle drew the ire of several WWF superstars including The Rock, who defeated him later that night. After the match Chris Jericho, who had been feuding with The Rock in the weeks leading up to Survivor Series over the WCW Championship, attacked him to reignite their feud.
Despite his self-congratulating attitude, no one found Angle to be the conquering hero he was portraying himself as and by the end of "Raw" he was depressed and told Vince McMahon that no one appreciated him. McMahon agreed with Angle and looked for a way to reward him.
That reward came was about to come in the ring moments later, as McMahon was about to announce the stripping of the WWF Championship from Steve Austin, who had not appeared on the show yet. McMahon's intent was to award it to Kurt Angle as a token of his appreciation for Angle's actions at Survivor Series. However, before he could do so he was interrupted by Ric Flair, who returned to a WWF ring for the first time since January 1993. He announced to a surprised McMahon that when Shane and Stephanie sold their shares in the WWF to purchase WCW and ECW, he was the man who was the buyer and that, as such, he was co-owner of the WWF and he and McMahon were now partners.
Shortly thereafter Austin entered the scene and made a beeline for Kurt Angle, beginning to beat him around the ring. When McMahon tried to intervene Austin gave him the same treatment, then finally returned to the fans' good graces for the first time since WrestleMania X-Seven, when he claimed his WWF Championship, and celebrated with beers for him and Flair in the ring.
Over the coming weeks the WWF decided what to do with the world championship situation, as now there were two world championships in the company. A tournament at Vengeance was conceived, where Austin and Angle would face each other for the WWF Championship and The Rock and Jericho would face each other for the unbranded World Championship. After those two matches, the winners would face off in one final match to unify both championships. Austin defeated Angle to retain while Jericho defeated The Rock to win the World Championship. In the finals Jericho defeated Austin due to outside interference from Booker T to become the first ever WWF Undisputed Champion.
Production.
Vince McMahon was originally supposed to be part of the main event but was replaced by Big Show due to injury. In addition, a title unification match between WCW Cruiserweight Champion Tajiri and WWF Light Heavyweight Champion X-Pac was canceled because X-Pac was injured and unable to compete. To resolve this, the WWF retired the Light Heavyweight Championship shortly after "Survivor Series" in favor of the Cruiserweight Championship lineage.

Survivor Series (2002)

Survivor Series (2002) was the sixteenth annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It took place on November 17, 2002, from Madison Square Garden in New York, New York and featured talent from both the Raw and SmackDown! brands. The official theme song was "Always" by Saliva, who performed the song and Chris Jericho's entrance music live from The World.
The main event was from the Raw brand the first ever Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship involving reigning champion Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Chris Jericho, Booker T, Rob Van Dam and Kane. Michaels won the match after last eliminating Triple H, pinning him after executing Sweet Chin Music. The predominant match on the SmackDown! brand was Brock Lesnar versus The Big Show for the WWE Championship, which Big Show won by pinfall after chokeslamming Lesnar on a steel chair. The featured matches on the undercard were a Triple Threat Elimination match for the WWE Tag Team Championship involving Edge and Rey Mysterio, Los Guerreros (Eddie and Chavo Guerrero), and Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit. Los Guerreros won the match and became WWE Tag Team Champions after last eliminating Edge and Mysterio.
Background.
The main feud heading into Survivor Series on the Raw brand was between Triple H, Rob Van Dam, Booker T, Kane, Chris Jericho and Shawn Michaels over the World Heavyweight Championship. The feud started on the September 2 edition of "Raw" when Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff awarded Triple H the World Heavyweight Championship in the form of the Big Gold Belt. Later on that edition, Triple H successfully defended the World title over Ric Flair but lost in a tag team match to both Ric Flair and Rob Van Dam towards the end of the show. On the September 9 edition of "Raw", Rob Van Dam became the number one contender to the World Championship by defeating Chris Jericho, Jeff Hardy, and The Big Show in a fatal four-way elimination match. The following week on "Raw", Van Dam lost the WWE Intercontinental Championship to Chris Jericho after interference by Triple H. At Unforgiven, Van Dam faced Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. Van Dam lost the title match after Ric Flair nailed him with the sledgehammer, allowing Triple H to finish him off with the pedigree, thus retaining the title. On the September 30 edition of "Raw", Triple H defeated Bubba Ray Dudley to retain the World title. Then later that night, Kane won the Intercontinental Championship from Jericho despite interference from Triple H and Ric Flair. The match was made between Triple H and Kane for No Mercy on October 20 in which both Kane's Intercontinental Championship and Triple H's World Heavyweight Championship were at stake. On the October 7 episode of "Raw", Kane successfully singlehandedly defended the World Tag Team Championship (that he had won on September 23) in a four team Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match as The Hurricane had been attacked earlier that evening (by Triple H and Ric Flair) and was thus unable to compete. The following week on "Raw", Kane and The Hurricane lost the tag titles to Christian and Jericho. Later that night, Triple H defeated RVD in Canadian lumberjack strap match after Ric Flair nailed Van Dam from behind with the World title belt while the referee was distracted. At No Mercy, Triple H went on to defeat Kane in title unification match which Triple won the IC Title and unified with his World Title. On the October 21 edition of "Raw", Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff announced that the first ever Elimination Chamber would take place at Survivor Series. Bischoff did this, as he wanted the Elimination Chamber match to be better than SmackDown!'s Hell in a Cell main event at No Mercy. On the October 28 edition of "Raw", Bischoff stated that the Elimination Chamber would be combination of WWE's Royal Rumble, Survivor Series, and WCW's War Games matches, in that a countdown timer comes from the Rumble and War Games, the enclosed cage format from War Games, and the elimination process from the Rumble and Series. Bischoff also added that the match will involve six superstars. This led to Bischoff revealing the six participants for the contest; Triple H, Chris Jericho, Booker T, Rob Van Dam, Kane and Shawn Michaels. Later on that edition, when World Champion Triple H took on Kane in a Casket match, Shawn Michaels (who Triple H put out of action after their Unsanctioned Street Fight at SummerSlam) emerged from the casket and assaulted Triple H. To gain further payback, Michaels then nailed him with the Sweet Chin Music, allowing Kane to put Triple H in the casket and closed the lid to win the match. On the November 4 edition of "Raw", Booker T and Kane defeated World Champion Triple H and Jericho in a tag team match after Michaels interfered again. Afterwords, Michaels accepted the offer of being part of the 1st ever Elimination Chamber for the World title at Survivor Series.
The main feud on the SmackDown! brand was between Brock Lesnar and The Big Show over the WWE Championship. Lesnar won the title three months prior at SummerSlam by defeating then-champion The Rock. Two months later at No Mercy, Lesnar defeated The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match to retain the title, pinning him after an F-5. On the October 24 edition of "SmackDown!", after claiming nobody on SmackDown! could defeat him, Big Show was traded to SmackDown!, immediately issuing a challenge to WWE Champion Brock Lesnar, who accepted later that night. Later that night, after Lesnar and Undertaker cut promos to one another, the Big Show threw Undertaker off the stage, thus injuring his neck. The next week on "SmackDown!", Lesnar faced off against Rey Mysterio, which ended in a no contest after Big Show interfered and tossed Mysterio into the crowd. Shortly after the match ended, Big Show slammed Lesnar through the announce table. The following week on "SmackDown!", Lesnar's manager Paul Heyman was convinced more than anyone that Lesnar could not win, trying to talk him out of defending the title. Lesnar refused and decided to challenge The Big Show to the ring. As Big Show came out, Lesnar drove him through the Steel steps. Moments later, Lesnar took out Big Show with five chair shots then nailed him with the Championship belt, proving a point that Lesnar can beat The Big Show when they face off at Survivor Series.
The other main feud on the card was between three tag teams, Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit, Edge and Rey Mysterio, and Los Guerreros (Eddie and Chavo Guerrero), over the WWE Tag Team Championships. On the October 3 edition of "SmackDown!", General Manager, Stephanie McMahon announced an eight team tournament to determine the new WWE tag team champions for the previous pay-per-view, No Mercy. On that edition, Los Guerreros defeated Rikishi and Mark Henry in the first Quarter Final round. The following week on "SmackDown", in the second Quarter Final round, Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit defeated John Cena and Billy Kidman while Edge and Rey Mysterio defeated WWE Champion Brock Lesnar and Tajiri to advance to the Semi-Finals tournament the following week. On the October 17 edition of "SmackDown", Edge and Mysterio defeated Reverend D-Von and Ron Simmons to advance to the tournament. Later on that edition, Angle and Benoit advanced to the tournament by defeating Los Guerreros. At No Mercy, Angle and Benoit defeated Edge and Mysterio in the finals of a tournament to determine the first WWE Tag Team Champions. On the October 24 edition of "SmackDown", Edge and Rey Mysterio defeated Los Guerreros in a number one contenders tag match to earn a shot at the tag titles. Later that night, the WWE Tag Team Champions, Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit fought each other in an Unforgiven return match, which Benoit won after interference from Los Guerreros. The following week on "SmackDown", both Benoit and Angle cost one another their matches. Angle helped Edge defeat Benoit then later that night, Benoit returned the favor by helping Eddie Guerrero defeat Angle. Afterwords, Angle and Benoit brawled at the halloween party, ending with Angle delivering an Angle slam and Benoit bashing the bottle into Angle's head at the same time, knocking each other down. On the November 7 edition of "SmackDown", Angle and Benoit lost the WWE Tag team titles to Edge and Mysterio in the best 2 out of 3 falls match after Edge pinned Angle in the third and final fall.
Another feud coming from the Raw brand was between Victoria and Trish Stratus for the WWE Women's Championship. At Unforgiven, Trish Stratus had captured her third Women's Championship from Victoria's mentor Molly Holly (who Trish lost the title to at King of the Ring on June 23). On September 23 on "Raw", Stratus successfully defended the Women's title against both Molly Holly and Victoria in a Triple Threat match then on the following week's edition of "Raw", Victoria challenged Stratus for the Women's title in a one-on-one contest but got Disqualified after hitting Stratus with a steel chair. On the October 7 edition of "Raw", after Women's Champion, Trish Stratus, defeated Stacy Keibler in a Bra and Panties/Paddle on a Pole match, Victoria attacked Stratus and performed a Moonsault on her. Victoria claimed in the interview that back in their days as fitness models, WWE wanted both of them but Trish stole her spot. The two fought again for the Women's Championship at No Mercy with Stratus retaining. For the following four weeks, the two would have many clashes on Raw including on the November 11 edition of "Raw", when Stratus ambushed Victoria following Victoria's attack on Terri Runnels. It was announced that the title would be put on the line in a hardcore rules match.
Event.
Before the event aired live on pay-per-view, Lance Storm and William Regal defeated The Hurricane and Goldust in a match that aired on Sunday Night HEAT. The first match of the event was an Elimination Tables match as Jeff Hardy, Bubba Ray Dudley and Spike Dudley faced 3-Minute Warning (Rosey, Jamal) and Rico. Spike was eliminated first as Rosey and Jamal performed a Double Flapjack on him. Rosey was next to go, as he was eliminated by Jeff Hardy with a Swanton Bomb. A miscue was picked up on the audio, as Rico was supposed to be knocked off the top rope, by Hardy, and Rico could be heard yelling in frustration "Come on Jeff, Goddammit!" With Hardy laying on the ground, outside of the ring, the remaining 3-Minute Warning member, Jamal, splashed off the top rope, eliminating Hardy from the match. At this point it was down to Jamal and Rico against Bubba Ray. As Bubba Ray fought for his team, he eliminated Jamal after performing a Top-Rope Powerbomb. D-Von Dudley hit the ring, and along with Bubba Ray, they performed the 3D onto Rico for the win.
The next match was for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship, with reigning champion Jamie Noble taking on Billy Kidman. Nidia accompanied Noble to the ring, and interfered with many parts of the match, including slapping Kidman across the face. Noble went after Kidman, but missed, and knocked Nidia off the apron. Kidman managed to hit the Shooting star press for the win. Billy Kidman was named Cruiserweight Champion.
The third match was for the WWE Women's Championship. It was a Hardcore match with reigning champion Trish Stratus taking on Victoria. Victoria choked Trish with a broomstick at the turnbuckle and hit her with a trash can lid. Trish recovered, and sent Victoria into an ironing board before hitting her several times with a Singapore cane. Victoria (with a bloody nose), went under the ring, and came back out with a fire extinguisher. Victoria sprayed Trish with the extinguisher and gave her a suplex, capturing the Women's title.
The fourth match was the encounter of The Big Show and Brock Lesnar for the WWE Championship. Lesnar came into the match with injured ribs, which Big Show took advantage of earlier into the match. However, Lesnar gained control over Big Show, and hit him with an F-5, which was a near pinfall, but the referee would be pulled out of the ring by Paul Heyman, who was managing Lesnar in the match. Show would however grab a steel chair, hit Lesnar in the ribs, and chokeslam Lesnar onto it and pinning Lesnar, winning the match and the WWE Championship.
The final match on the undercard was a Triple threat Tag team match for the WWE Tag Team Championship between the team of Los Guerreros (Eddie and Chavo Guerrero), Edge and Rey Mysterio, and Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit. A back and forth match between the three teams, until Edge attacked Benoit with a Spear, eliminating the team of Angle and Benoit. The final elimination was the team of Edge and Mysterio, when Eddie forced Mysterio to submit to the Lasso from El Paso, thus Los Guerreros winning the match and the WWE Tag Team Championship. After the match, Scott Steiner made his return to WWE, and attacked Christopher Nowinski and Matt Hardy after they had given an insulting promo about New York City and its citizens.
The main event was an Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship between Rob Van Dam, Kane, Triple H, Chris Jericho, Booker T, and Shawn Michaels. The match started off with Triple H facing off against Rob Van Dam, while the remaining four superstars were locked in the four chambers. Superstars entered the match at five minute intervals; the first elimination was made by Booker T after he pinned Rob Van Dam when Van Dam blew his knee after executing his finisher, the "5-Star Frog Splash", on Triple H from the top of one of the chamber pods. However, Booker T would be the next elimination after Jericho pinned him. The third elimination was made by Jericho when he pinned Kane, but Jericho would be the next elimination after Michaels pinned him. The final elimination was made when Michaels nailed Triple H with his superkick, which he calls "Sweet Chin Music", and pinned him, thus winning the match and the World Heavyweight Championship.
Aftermath.
Shawn Michaels and Triple H continued their feud over the World Heavyweight Championship. On the November 25 edition of "Raw", Michaels defended the World title against Rob Van Dam; however, Michaels retained the title with help from Triple H. The following week on "Raw", Van Dam faced off against Triple H, with Michaels as Special Guest referee, to determine the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship at Armageddon. Michaels awarded the win to Triple H and the two brawled with one another. The next week, on the December 9 edition of "Raw", Michaels attacked Triple H and Ric Flair with an iron shovel outside the arena. Michaels then smashed Triple H with a trash can, causing him to fall inside a dumpster. Shortly after, Michaels climbed to the top of a trailer and jumped off onto Triple H. At Armageddon, Triple H defeated Michaels in a Three Stages of Hell match to win the title. The first match was a Street fight, which Triple H won. The match that followed was a Steel Cage match, which Michaels won. The third and final match was a Ladder match, which was won by Triple H.

Survivor Series (2003)

Survivor Series (2003) was the seventeenth annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was presented by Microsoft's Xbox. It took place on November 16, 2003, at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas and featured talent from both Raw and SmackDown!.
The main match on the Raw brand was for the World Heavyweight Championship between Goldberg and Triple H, which Goldberg won by pinfall after performing a Spear and Jackhammer. The predominant match on the SmackDown! brand was a Buried Alive match between The Undertaker and Vince McMahon, which Vince won after Kane interfered and helped Vince bury Undertaker. This would also be marked as The Undertaker's last appearance portraying Big Evil/The American Badass, as he would return four months later at WrestleMania XX in his Deadman persona for the first time since mid-1999. The predominant match on the Raw brand was a 5 on 5 Traditional Survivor Series match between Team Bischoff (Chris Jericho, Christian, Randy Orton, Scott Steiner and Mark Henry) and Team Austin (Shawn Michaels, Rob Van Dam, Booker T, Bubba Ray Dudley, and D-Von Dudley). Team Bischoff won the match after Orton last eliminated Michaels. The main match on the card featured an Ambulance match between Kane and Shane McMahon, which Kane won after throwing Shane into the ambulance.
Background.
The main feud on the Raw brand was between Goldberg and Triple H, with the two feuding over the World Heavyweight Championship. At SummerSlam, Triple H and Goldberg were involved in the second six men Elimination Chamber match for the World Championship (the first one being the previous year at Survivor Series). After Goldberg eliminated three other men in that match, he went after Triple H. At the end, Goldberg attempted another Spear on Triple H, who countered the maneuver by hitting Goldberg in the head with a sledgehammer for the win. On the following night's edition of "Raw", Goldberg challenged Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. Triple H then came out and added the stipulation that, should Goldberg lose, he would retire from WWE. At the previous Raw brand pay-per-view Unforgiven, Goldberg defeated Triple H with the title and his career on the line, when he performed a Jackhammer to win the title. On the September 29 edition of "Raw", Triple H made an announcement, offering a bounty of $100,000 to anyone who could successfully "take out" Goldberg. The first person that attempted to take the bounty was Steven Richards, but Goldberg quickly took him out. Many other people tried and failed to take him out including La Résistance, Mark Henry and Tommy Dreamer. It was during a World Heavyweight Championship match between Goldberg and Shawn Michaels on the October 20 edition of "Raw", however, that he was taken out. Batista ran-in, dragged Michaels out of the ring and, in storyline, assaulted him. Batista then entered the ring, and proceeded to attack Goldberg. He put a folding chair around Goldberg's ankle, before jumping off the middle rope onto the chair, in storyline, "shattering" Goldberg's ankle. Evolution then made their way to the ring, and gave the $100,000 bounty to Batista. With Goldberg seemingly out of action, Raw Co-General Manager Eric Bischoff looked set to present Triple H with the World Heavyweight Championship on the October 27 edition of "Raw". The other Co-General Manager of Raw, Stone Cold Steve Austin came to the ring, however, and announced that Goldberg would be back to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at Survivor Series. Goldberg got his revenge on Batista on the November 3 edition of "Raw" as he performed a spear to Batista. He attempted to injure Batista using the same technique that Batista used on Goldberg. Ric Flair tried to intervene, but he too got speared. Austin then announced that Batista and Goldberg would go one-on-one on the November 10 edition of "Raw", just six days before Survivor Series. Goldberg looked set to beat Batista, but Triple H interfered, signaling a Disqualification. Triple H got his signature Sledgehammer out from underneath the ring, and looked set to attack Goldberg with it, but Goldberg managed to fight back, and speared Triple H. Goldberg picked up the sledgehammer, and attacked Batista with it, getting the advantage heading into the pay-per-view.
The main feud on the SmackDown! brand was between WWE Chairman Vince McMahon and The Undertaker. At the previous SmackDown! brand pay-per-view, No Mercy, McMahon interfered in a WWE Championship Biker Chain match between the Champion Brock Lesnar and Undertaker, helping Lesnar retain the title. Also at the same pay-per-view, Vince defeated his daughter Stephanie McMahon in an "I Quit" match. Due to a pre-match stipulation between the two, Stephanie had to quit her job as SmackDown! General Manager. The following week, on the October 23 edition of "SmackDown!", Vince announced Paul Heyman as the new SmackDown! General Manager. In his first act as General Manager, Heyman booked a handicap match, with Undertaker facing Brock Lesnar and The Big Show, with the stipulation that if he won, Undertaker could choose to face any superstar at any event. Heyman put many stipulations in Undertaker's way during the bout, but despite this and taking a huge beating, Undertaker won the contest. As a fallen Undertaker laid in the entryway McMahon began screaming at him, saying that he would never be WWE Champion again as long as he was alive and that he demanded to know what kind of match Undertaker would seek now that he could pick anyone to face at anytime. The injured Undertaker told McMahon that he would be competing in a Buried Alive match at Survivor Series. Assuming Undertaker would choose Lesnar as his opponent, McMahon continued to berate him by saying he hoped that the then-WWE Champion would bury him "six feet under". Undertaker then snatched the microphone away from the owner of WWE and declared that he would not be facing Lesnar in the match, but instead would face a stunned and angry McMahon. On the October 30 edition of "SmackDown!", Heyman announced that he had given Undertaker time off until Survivor Series, which made Vince McMahon very unhappy. Vince McMahon stated that he would "burn down Undertaker's house and order Undertaker's wife to be gang raped" if Heyman didn't do anything about the Buried Alive match. Both Undertaker and Vince were interviewed on the November 6 edition of "SmackDown!". In his promo, Undertaker stated that the feud with Vince was personal. He went on to say that McMahon respects nobody and that McMahon disrespects his family. Later in the show, McMahon asked for forgiveness from the fans for his actions over the past few months.
Primary feud from Raw brand heading into the event was between the two Co-General Managers on Raw, Stone Cold Steve Austin and Eric Bischoff. Bischoff had control of the brand since July 15, 2002, but on April 28, 2003 (the night after the Backlash pay per view), he was forced to share his General Manager duties with Austin. Their feud over who had the most power as General Manager continued on "Raw" throughout the Summer of 2003. On the October 20 edition of "Raw", Bischoff proposed that he and Austin should face off in a "Traditional 5-on-5 Survivor Series match", with both selecting teams of five. Austin promptly accepted the challenge, with Bischoff announcing the first two members of his team as Scott Steiner and Chris Jericho. Later in the night, Booker T was announced as the first member of Austin's Survivor Series team. The following week, Rob Van Dam, Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley were named as members of Austin's team. For Team Bischoff, Christian and Mark Henry were announced as members as well. On the November 3 edition of "Raw", both Austin and Bischoff announced their final members to join their respective team; Shawn Michaels accepted Austin's invitation to join his team and Bischoff announced as Randy Orton the last member to join his team. The on and off feud between five members from Team Austin and Team Bischoff originally began during the Summer of 2001, when Rob Van Dam, the Dudley boyz, and Booker T (who were a part of The Alliance) started their feud with Christian and Chris Jericho (who were a part of the then-known WWF) when they all were involved in the Invasion storyline but the storyline ended at that year's Survivor Series event when The Rock (who fought for Team WWF) won the 5-on-5 Winner Takes All match, thus putting the Alliance out of business. During the Summer and Fall of 2002, Booker T (from Team Austin), along with Goldust, had fought Jericho and Christian (from Team Bischoff) in singles and tag team competition. They also fought for the World Tag Team Championship that Jericho and Christian held at the time until December 2002 at Armageddon when they dropped the titles to Booker T and Goldust in a Fatal Four-Way Elimination match. After Armageddon, Chris Jericho along with Christian entered a feud with Shawn Michaels (from Team Austin), after Jericho claimed that he was the next Shawn Michaels. On the January 13, 2003 edition of "Raw", Jericho won a battle royal to select his entry number for the Royal Rumble match, choosing number two in order to start the match with Michaels, who had already been named number one. At the Royal Rumble, Jericho, with the help of Christian, eliminated Michaels. Moments later during the Rumble match, Michaels retaliated by assaulting Jericho, which allowed Test to eliminate Jericho. The following two months, the feud between Jericho and Michaels continued to escalate leading up to their match at WrestleMania XIX. During that event, Michaels defeated Jericho when he countered Jericho's suplex into a Roll-up that gave Michaels a successful pinfall, thus the victory. On the July 21st edition of "Raw", Jericho defeated Michaels in a rematch with the help of then Evolution member Randy Orton (from Team Bischoff). At Unforgiven on September 21, Orton defeated Shawn Michaels in the first of many high profile matches billed as "Legend versus Legend Killer", with the help of his stablemate and mentor Ric Flair. The feud between Christian and Rob Van Dam (from Team Austin) originally started after Christian became the three-time WWE Intercontinental Champion by defeating Booker T at an untelevised house show. At Unforgiven, Christian successfully defended the Intercontinental title against both Rob Van Dam and Chris Jericho in a Triple Threat match when he pinned RVD. Then in the following two matches in one week, Christian defended the title against RVD including on the September 29, 2003 edition of "Raw", when he lost the title to RVD in a Ladder match. On that same episode of "Raw", Scott Steiner (from Team Bischoff) turned heel by belly to belly suplexing Stacy Keibler after Keibler accidentally cost Steiner and Test the World Tag Team Championship against the Dudley boyz (from Team Austin). While Steiner and Test teamed together, with Keibler their reluctant manager, Steiner would feud with RVD and the Dudley boyz respectively in the weeks leading up to Survivor Series. During the Summer of 2003, Mark Henry (from Team Bischoff) returned to WWE television on the Raw roster, where he found some success as a member of "Thuggin' And Buggin' Enterprises," led by Theodore Long. During that time, Henry was involved in a brief program with World Heavyweight Champion Goldberg when then champion, Triple H, put a bounty on Goldberg. This was followed by a brief rivalry that he had with Shawn Michaels, before he engaged in a scripted rivalry with Booker T (who returned to Raw from a nagging back injury). On the November 10th edition of "Raw", Team Austin and Team Bischoff were scheduled four matches with Team Austin gaining 4-0 victories in one night. In a tag team match, the Dudley Boyz defeated Scott Steiner and Mark Henry via disqualification, while in three singles matches, Rob Van Dam defeated Christian, Booker T defeated Chris Jericho, and Shawn Michaels defeated Randy Orton to get the greater advantage heading into the pay-per-view
Event.
Before the event aired live on pay-per-view, a "Sunday Night Heat" match was aired, which saw Tajiri (with Akio and Sakoda) retain the WWE Cruiserweight Championship against Jamie Noble. Tajiri pinned Noble after a Buzzsaw Kick.
The first match of the event was the Survivor Series match with Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit, John Cena, Hardcore Holly, and Bradshaw) against Team Lesnar (Brock Lesnar, The Big Show, Matt Morgan, Nathan Jones and A-Train). Hardcore Holly was the first superstar eliminated, as he was disqualified for pushing the referee, while attacking Brock Lesnar before the match. A-Train was then eliminated by Bradshaw after a Clothesline From Hell. Bradshaw was then eliminated after a Chokeslam by Big Show. Matt Morgan was eliminated next after Kurt Angle hit an Angle Slam on Morgan, allowing Angle to cover him for the elimination. Nathan Jones was the third eliminated member of Team Lesnar, after he submitted to the Ankle Lock. Angle was the next member eliminated off Team Angle, after an F-5 from Lesnar. Lesnar was the next to be eliminated, after he submitted to Chris Benoit's Crippler Crossface. Big Show was the final member eliminated off Team Lesnar, after a chain shot and an FU by John Cena, thus Cena and Benoit becoming the Survivors of the match, and earning the win for Team Angle.
The next match was for the WWE Women's Championship between Molly Holly and Lita. The match ended up on the outside on two separate occasions. Lita missed a Litasault and Molly took advantage and hit the Molly-Go-Round. However Lita kicked out, forcing Molly to expose a turnbuckle into which she gave Lita a drop toe hold, thus retaining the Women's title.
The third match was an Ambulance match between Shane McMahon and Kane. The match started on the outside when Shane was thrown into the steel steps by Kane. Mid-way in the match, Shane was able to hit the Leap of Faith on Kane on the Spanish announce table. Following the maneuver, Shane took control in the match, as he hit Kane with a kendo stick, rammed Kane through a security booth with an SUV. Shane then called for an ambulance. Shane maneuvered Kane onto a stretcher and started pushing it towards the ambulance, however Kane sat up and bounced Shane off. Shane was able to do a Coast-To-Coast off the roof of the ambulance on Kane. The match came to an end, when Kane hit Shane with a Tombstone Piledriver on the floor and then threw him into the ambulance, which resulted in Kane gaining the win.
The fourth match was between The Basham Brothers (Doug and Danny) and Los Guerreros (Eddie and Chavo) for the WWE Tag Team Championship. The match started on the outside. Los Guerreros attacked Shaniqua, who tried to interfere. Chavo hit a swinging DDT, but he accidentally hit the DDT on Eddie. As Chavo went to check on Eddie, Danny pinned Chavo with a roll-up, thus the Bashams retaining the WWE Tag Team titles.
The fifth match was the second Survivor Series match with Team Bischoff (Chris Jericho, Christian, Randy Orton, Scott Steiner and Mark Henry) against Team Austin (Shawn Michaels, Rob Van Dam, Booker T, Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley). Scott Steiner was the first one eliminated, as Booker T was able to hit a Book-end on Steiner and capture the pinfall after Stacy Keibler distracted Steiner. Booker T was then eliminated by Mark Henry after a World's Strongest Slam. Mark Henry was then eliminated after a 3-D and Five-Star Frog splash. Rob Van Dam was eliminated next after Randy Orton hit an RKO on RVD, allowing Orton to cover him for the elimination. D-Von Dudley was the third eliminated member of Team Austin, after Chris Jericho hit the Flashback. Bubba Ray Dudley was the next member eliminated off Team Austin, after an Unprettier from Christian. Christian was the next to be eliminated, after Shawn Michaels, who was the last member of Team Austin, hit Christian with Sweet Chin Music. Jericho was the next member eliminated of Team Bischoff, as he tried to apply the Walls of Jericho on Michaels, however Michaels countered it into a Cradle. As the elimination took place, it left Michaels and Orton as the final two members of their respective teams. However, the match came to an end, when Batista gave Michaels a Batista Bomb, after Austin and Bischoff brawled in the entrance set, Orton draped an arm over Michaels and got the pinfall. As a result of his team losing, Austin lost his position as Co-General Manager of Raw.
The match that followed was the Buried Alive match between The Undertaker and Vince McMahon. At the start of the match, Undertaker hit McMahon with one big punch to the face, which resulted in McMahon bleeding. Vince's face was covered in lots of blood. Undertaker hit McMahon in the head with one of the shovels. After many assaults by Undertaker, he carried McMahon to the grave site. McMahon was able to hit the Undertaker with a shovel, which resulted in Undertaker falling to the grave site, but pulled McMahon into it as well. Undertaker climbed up to a front loader to empty a ton of dirt on the grave, but an explosion knocked him out. Kane appeared out of nowhere, beat on Undertaker and threw him into the grave. McMahon operated the front loader and dumped all the dirt from it, burying the Undertaker and thus winning the match.
The final match of the night was between Goldberg and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. In the match, Triple H focused on Goldberg's injured ankle. In the duration of the match, Ric Flair, Randy Orton and Batista all interfered on behalf of Triple H; however, Goldberg hit Flair, Orton and Batista with a sledgehammer, which was brought in by Triple H. The match came to an end when Goldberg nailed Triple H with a Spear, and then followed up with the Jackhammer for the pinfall and thus retaining the World Heavyweight Championship.

Survivor Series (2004)

Survivor Series (2004) was the eighteenth annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was presented by Microsoft's Xbox and took place on November 14, 2004 at the Gund Arena in Cleveland, Ohio and starred talent from both the Raw and SmackDown! brands.
The main match on the Raw brand was a 4 on 4 Survivor Series match, a type of elimination match, between Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, and Maven) and Team Triple H (Triple H, Edge, Batista, and Snitsky), which Team Orton won after Orton last eliminated Triple H. The predominant match on the SmackDown! brand was John "Bradshaw" Layfield (JBL) versus Booker T for the WWE Championship, which JBL won by pinfall after hitting Booker with the title belt. The primary match on the undercard was a 4 on 4 Survivor Series match between Team Guerrero (Eddie Guerrero, The Big Show, Rob Van Dam, and John Cena) and Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Carlito, Luther Reigns and Mark Jindrak), which Team Guerrero won after Big Show last eliminated Angle.
Several of the existing feuds carried on following the event. Triple H continued feuding with Randy Orton, and at New Year's Revolution in January, Triple H last eliminated Orton in an Elimination Chamber match to win the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. John "Bradshaw" Layfield also continued his feud with Booker T, defeating him, Eddie Guerrero, and The Undertaker at Armageddon. Following the event, Carlito sustained a legitimate injury and lost the WWE United States Championship to John Cena, with whom he was in a storyline.
Background.
The event featured seven professional wrestling matches with outcomes predetermined by WWE script writers. The matches featured wrestlers portraying their characters in planned storylines that took place before, during and after the event. All wrestlers were from one of the WWE's brands – SmackDown and Raw – the two storyline divisions in which WWE assigned its employees.
The main feud on the Raw brand was between Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho and Maven) and Team Triple H (Triple H, Edge, Batista and Snitsky). On the October 25, 2004 episode of "Raw", Evolution (Triple H, Ric Flair and Batista) were put in charge of "Raw", after General Manager Eric Bischoff took the night off. Triple H granted Flair the match of his choice; Flair wanted a rematch with Orton, as he lost a Steel Cage match to Orton at Taboo Tuesday. Orton accepted Flair's challenge, with a stipulation that if he defeated Flair he would get an opportunity to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at Survivor Series. Orton, however, lost the match after interference by Triple H, giving the win to Flair, so Orton did not receive an opportunity for the World Heavyweight title. On the November 1 episode of "Raw", General Manager Eric Bischoff scheduled a traditional 8-man elimination tag team match between Orton, Jericho, Maven and Benoit and Triple H, Batista, Edge and Snistky at Survivor Series. The winning team at Survivor Series would be granted absolute control of running "Raw" for a month. The following week, Bischoff concluded with adding that the winning members at Survivor Series would all get a week to be in charge of "Raw". That same night, Edge and Chris Benoit were scheduled in a match, where Triple H, Batista, Orton, Jericho and Maven came out to ringside to watch the match. At ringside, a fight broke out between Triple H and Orton's team, which caused the match to end in a No Contest.
The predominant feud on the SmackDown! brand was between John "Bradshaw" Layfield (JBL) versus Booker T, with the two battling over JBL's WWE Championship. On the October 21, 2004 episode of "SmackDown!", SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long booked a six man tag team match involving Booker T, Rob Van Dam, and Rey Mysterio taking on JBL, Kenzo Suzuki, and René Duprée. At the time, Booker T was a heel and congratulated JBL's success with the company in a segment backstage. The tag team match got underway, and JBL was led to believe that Booker T was going to betray Van Dam and Mysterio, as Booker T warned both Van Dam and Mysterio not to interfere with him during the match. The match concluded with Booker T pinning JBL after an axe kick, thus turning Booker face. The following week on "SmackDown!", Booker T defeated Orlando Jordan to earn the right to face JBL for the WWE Championship at Survivor Series. On the November 4 episode of "SmackDown!", JBL interfered in a match between Booker T and Orlando Jordan, which ended in a disqualification, giving Booker T the win. After the disqualification by JBL, Theodore Long scheduled a tag team match between Booker T and Josh Mathews versus JBL and Orlando Jordan. The tag team victory was given to Booker T and Matthews, as Booker pinned Jordan for the win.
One of the primary matches on the SmackDown! brand was between Team Guerrero (Eddie Guerrero, The Big Show, Rob Van Dam and John Cena) versus Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Carlito, Luther Reigns and Mark Jindrak). On the October 28, 2004 episode of "SmackDown", Theodore Long booked a 4-on-4 Survivor Series elimination match between Team Guerrero, Big Show, Van Dam, and Rey Mysterio against Team Angle, Carlito, Reigns and Jindrak. The following week, however, Mysterio was removed from the elimination match, as Long booked Mysterio in a Fatal Four-Way match for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. Guerrero was given a week to choose a member for his team at Survivor Series. On the November 11 episode of "SmackDown!", Guerrero announced that John Cena, who was recovering from a storyline injury, would be joining his team at Survivor Series.
Event.
Before the event went live on pay-per-view, La Résistance (Sylvan Grenier and Robért Conway) defeated The Hurricane and Rosey to retain the World Tag Team Championship in a match taped for "Sunday Night Heat".
Preliminary matches.
The first match that aired was a Fatal Four-Way match for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship between Spike Dudley, Billy Kidman, Chavo Guerrero, and Rey Mysterio. After back and forth action, Spike pinned Chavo, after Billy Kidman performed a springboard leg drop on Chavo, to retain the WWE Cruiserweight Championship.
Next was a match between Shelton Benjamin and Christian for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. During the match, Benjamin got up on the ring apron and tried to take out Tyson Tomko, who accompanied Christian to the match, but Christian ran and launched Benjamin him off, sending Benjamin to the outside. Control of the match went back and forth, but the bout came to an end when Benjamin pinned Christian after a T-Bone Suplex.
The third match of the night was the SmackDown! Survivor Series match with Team Guerrero (Eddie Guerrero, The Big Show, Rob Van Dam, and John Cena) versus Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Mark Jindrak, Luther Reigns, and Carlito). Carlito was the first competitor eliminated, as he was chased from the arena by John Cena before the match began. Rob Van Dam was then eliminated by Kurt Angle after a pinfall with a roll-up using the ropes for leverage. Mark Jindrak was then eliminated by Eddie Guerrero, as Guerrero gained a pinfall similar to Angle eliminating Van Dam. Luther Reigns was eliminated from the match, after a Big Show performed a chokeslam. Angle was the final member eliminated from his team, after an FU by Cena and a frog splash by Guerrero, which led to Big Show covering Angle for the pinfall victory for Team Guerrero.
Main event matches.
The fourth match was the bout between The Undertaker and Heidenreich. Both the Undertaker and Heidenreich managed to get the upper hand in the match. During the match, Paul Heyman interfered on behalf of Heidenreich. As Undertaker connected with a chokeslam on Heidenreich, he proceeded to perform a Tombstone Piledriver and pinned Heidenreich for the pinfall victory.
The fifth match was the encounter between Trish Stratus and Lita for the WWE Women's Championship. The match saw Stratus smash Lita's head on the Raw announcers' table. Lita, however, responded by hitting Stratus with a steel chair. As a result, Lita was disqualified, and Stratus retained the Women's Championship.
The sixth match was for the WWE Championship between John "Bradshaw" Layfield (JBL) and Booker T. The match saw both men take the advantage over one another. Orlando Jordan interfered several times by attacking Booker T. During the match, the referee was knocked out by JBL. Booker T managed to perform the scissors kick on JBL, as a new referee came down to the ring to officiate the match. Jordan, however, removed JBL from the ring and tried to hit Booker T with the WWE Championship title belt. Booker T countered by performing the Book End on Jordan. JBL then grabbed the belt, hit Booker T with it, and pinned him to retain the WWE Championship.
The final match was the Survivor Series match between Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, and Maven) versus Team Triple H (Triple H, Batista, Edge, and Snitsky). Maven, however, was attacked backstage by Snitsky and removed from the elimination match. Chris Benoit was the first man to be eliminated, as he was pinned by Edge, after Triple H performed the Pedigree. Batista was then eliminated by Chris Jericho, after Randy Orton hit Batista with the World Heavyweight title belt and a running enziguri by Jericho. Snitsky was disqualified and eliminated from the match for hitting Maven, who had returned to the ring for the match. Maven was the second eliminated member of Team Orton, as he was pinned by Triple H. Jericho was the next member eliminated, after a spear from Edge. Orton eliminated Edge, after he performed an RKO for the elimination. Triple H was the final member eliminated from his team, after an RKO by Orton for the pinfall victory for Team Orton.
Aftermath.
As Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho and Maven) defeated Team Triple H (Triple H, Edge, Batista and Snitsky) at Survivor Series, they were given the opportunity to be in charge of "Raw" for a month; On the November 29 episode of "Raw", Randy Orton was in charge and scheduled a World Heavyweight title Battle Royal. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, however, overruled the Battle Royal match and instead booked Triple H to face the winner of the Battle Royal. The battle royal match saw Chris Benoit and Edge, as the final two participants, going over the top rope at the same time, ostensibly ending the match. Orton, acting as General Manager, booked a Triple Threat match between Benoit, Edge, and Triple H for the World Heavyweight title. The match resulted in Benoit applying the Crossface on Edge, only for Edge to manage to roll Benoit over, while the Crossface was still locked in, causing Benoit’s shoulders to touch the mat. The referee began counting, which moments later led to Edge to submit to the maneuver. The following week, with Chris Jericho in charge, Vince McMahon vacated the World Heavyweight title, concluding the match ended in a tie. On the December 13 episode of "Raw", Eric Bischoff, who had resumed his position as General Manager, scheduled an Elimination Chamber match between Triple H, Edge, Benoit, Chris Jericho, Orton and Batista at New Year's Revolution for the vacant World Heavyweight title. The following week, Bischoff concluded with adding a Special Guest Referee for the Elimination Chamber: Shawn Michaels. At New Year's Revolution, Triple H won the Elimination Chamber to begin his tenth world title reign.
After retaining the WWE Championship against Booker T, John "Bradshaw" Layfield (JBL) was inserted into previous feuds with Eddie Guerrero, Booker T, and The Undertaker. The feud led to SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long to book a Fatal Four-Way match at Armageddon in December. The match was won by JBL, as he pinned Booker T after a Clothesline from Hell and successfully retained the title.
In October, John Cena lost the WWE United States Championship to Carlito Caribbean Cool, who debuted on "SmackDown!". As part of the storyline, Carlito's bodyguard, Jesús, stabbed Cena in the kidney while at a nightclub. On the November 18 episode of "SmackDown!", Cena regained the United States Championship by defeating Carlito. Cena also debuted a "custom made" spinner-style title belt.

Survivor Series (2005)

Survivor Series (2005) was the 19th annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was presented by NovaLogic's "" and took place on November 27, 2005 at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan and featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown! brands.
Six professional wrestling matches were scheduled on the event's card, which featured a supercard, a scheduling of more than one main event. The first of the main events was an interpromotional 5-on-5 Survivor Series match, a type of elimination match, between Team SmackDown! (Batista, Rey Mysterio, John "Bradshaw" Layfield (JBL), Bobby Lashley, and Randy Orton) and Team Raw (Shawn Michaels, Kane, The Big Show, Carlito, and Chris Masters); which Team SmackDown! won after Orton last eliminated Michaels, and become the sole survivor in his Survivor Series match for the third straight year. The other main event was a standard wrestling match between wrestlers from the Raw brand, in which WWE Champion John Cena defeated Kurt Angle to retain his title. Another match was a Last Man Standing match—a match where the first person unable to respond to a ten count by the referee lost—between Triple H and Ric Flair. Triple H won the match after Flair failed to get to his feet before the referee counted to ten.
Background.
Six professional wrestling matches were featured on the event's card. Matches were planned with predetermined outcomes by WWE's creative staff and featured wrestlers playing characters for the entertainment of the audience. All wrestlers were from either Raw or SmackDown!—the two brand divisions to which WWE assigned its employees.
The main leading rivalry scripted into the event was between the Raw and SmackDown! brands as a whole, rather than individual wrestlers. Eric Bischoff and Theodore Long, the authority figures of Raw and SmackDown! respectively, began an angle on the October 3 episode of "Raw", a special episode billed as ""WWE Homecoming"." A special match featuring SmackDown! superstars was scheduled for the show; but as it began, Bischoff came out and ended the match by turning the lights off. Later in the show, Long came out and interrupted a Raw match in return, and as a result, the two brands started a brawl. The two brands interfered in the other's show before facing each other in a tag team match at Taboo Tuesday, a month earlier. The two teams consisted of Rey Mysterio and Matt Hardy (from SmackDown!) and Chris Masters and Snitsky. Team SmackDown! won the match. After Taboo Tuesday, Bischoff and Long decided on a 5-on-5 Survivor Series match, a type of elimination match, and a singles match (also known as a standard wrestling match) between the two at Survivor Series. The teams feuded on both shows, and Batista (Dave Bautista), the captain of the SmackDown! team, suffered an injury after being attacked several times. Eddie Guerrero was originally scheduled to be on Team SmackDown!, but due to his death on November 13, 2005, he was replaced by Randy Orton.
Another rivalry heading into the event was between John Cena and Kurt Angle, over the WWE Championship. Their feud began in August, when Bischoff chose Angle as the number one contender to the WWE Championship. Angle failed to win the title at Unforgiven, due to Cena disqualifying himself. At Taboo Tuesday, Shawn Michaels was chosen by the fans as the third participant in their Triple Threat match, a standard wrestling match involving three wrestlers, however, Cena retained the title. On the November 7 edition of "Raw", Angle refused to compete due to the "you suck" chants from the audience. Angle finally agreed to compete when Bischoff censored the crowd and let him have a special guest referee, whom Angle chose to be Daivari. Daivari's officiating was unfair and biased towards Angle's opponents.
Another staged rivalry was between Triple H and Ric Flair. It began at "WWE Homecoming", when Triple H returned to WWE television after three months. The two had been aligned since 2002, as members of Evolution, and were partners in a tag team match on the show. After they won the match, Triple H turned on Flair, and attacked him with a sledgehammer. The week after, Triple H explained his actions, saying that he realized Flair was no longer the legend he was, and he needed to stop Flair. Flair and Triple H met in a steel cage match at Taboo Tuesday, a match where two wrestlers fight in a cage with four sheets of mesh metal which Flair won. A Last Man Standing match was made between the two for Survivor Series.
Event.
Before the event began and aired live on pay-per-view, a dark match was contested between Juventud and Simon Dean, which Juventud won. After the dark match, the pay-per-view event began with Booker T (accompanied by Sharmell) facing off against Chris Benoit in the first match of their "Best of 7 series" for the vacant WWE United States Championship. The match started with Booker T exiting the ring when Benoit gained a slight advantage. The match went back and forth for the first half before Booker T took control. The match saw interference by Sharmell, as she distracted Benoit, who was on the top ropes. Booker T won the match with a pin and using the ropes for leverage, after Benoit missed a free fall headbutt. Booker T took a 1–0 lead in the series.
The match that followed was between Trish Stratus (accompanied by Mickie James) and Melina (accompanied by Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro for the WWE Women's Championship. The match started with Stratus immediately taken control until Melina fought back. Nitro and Mercury interfered during the title match, but the referee ejected them from ringside. Melina kept control over Stratus until she fought back with forearm shots. Stratus, however, executed a diving bulldog and pinning Melina to win and retain the title.
The third bout was a Last Man Standing match between Triple H and Ric Flair. Triple H attacked Flair on his way to the ring, and gained the early advantage. After attacking Flair's head with a screwdriver, Triple H continued using foreign objects throughout the match, including a folding chair, a sledgehammer, and the steel ring steps. The match saw back and forth action between Triple H and Flair. The match saw Triple H attempt to hit Flair with a Pedigree on the announce table, but Flair countered the Pedigree into a back body drop through another announce table. Triple H, however, performed the Pedigree three times on Flair, but Flair got up each time. Triple H then hit Flair in the back with a sledgehammer, and Flair did not get to his feet before the referee's ten count, and as a result, Triple H won the match. After the match, Edge and Lita came into the ring, and Edge announced that he would be hosting a new show on "Raw" entitled "The Cutting Edge". Edge noted that Dmitri Young was in the audience, and proceeded to criticize the sports teams of Detroit. Young replied by insulting Edge and his lack of a world championship.
The fourth match saw John Cena defending the WWE Championship against Kurt Angle with Daivari as the special guest referee. Early in the match, Angle was able to apply the Ankle lock on Cena. Cena reached the ropes, but Daivari kicked his hand off. An angered Cena slapped Daivari, who tried to disqualify him as a result. Angle, however, stopped him, and both men were knocked out of the ring by Cena. As Daivari was knocked down outside, a Raw referee came out soon after to officiate. After Cena gained the advantage, Angle knocked down the referee, and executed an illegal low blow. Angle called for another referee, but failed to get the win after executing an Olympic Slam and a superplex. After Angle missed a moonsault attempt, Cena went for an FU; however, Angle countered by holding onto the referee, which led to Angle knocking down the referee. As the other referee was knocked out, a SmackDown! referee came out, Cena then hit a DDT on Daivari. Shortly after, Cena executed an FU on Angle, and pinned him to win the match and retain the title.
The fifth match was between Raw authority figure Eric Bischoff and SmackDown! authority figure Theodore Long, who was accompanied by Palmer Cannon. A referee from both shows officiated the match. Long started the match by avoiding Bischoff's attacks. As Cannon climbed on the apron, and distracted the referees, Bischoff used his obi to choke Long. Bischoff continued to choke Long and applied the sleeper hold. Cannon distracted the referees again as Long hit Bischoff with his shoe. Bischoff then hit Long with a chop to the throat. The Boogeyman's music played with Bischoff sending the referees up the ramp to stop him. The Boogeyman was behind Bischoff, however, and he performed pumphandle slam on Bischoff. Long took advantage of that and pinned Bischoff to win the match.
The final match was the Survivor Series match between Team SmackDown! (Batista, Rey Mysterio, John "Bradshaw" Layfield, Bobby Lashley and Randy Orton) and Team Raw (Shawn Michaels, Kane, The Big Show, Carlito and Chris Masters). The match started with both teams taking control. The first elimination occurred when Kane performed a chokeslam on Lashley and Michaels pinning Lashley for the elimination. Kane was then eliminated by Batista after a 619 from Mysterio and a spinebuster from Batista. After that, Batista was eliminated after a double chokeslam by Big Show and Kane. Big Show was eliminated next after a Clothesline From Hell by JBL, a 619 from Mysterio, an RKO by Orton, another Clothesline by JBL and a seated senton by Mysterio. Mysterio then pinned him for the elimination. Carlito was then eliminated, after JBL performed a Clothesline From Hell. The next elimination was made by Mysterio, as he hit a Springboard Legdrop on Masters for the elimination. Michaels went onto eliminate both Mysterio and JBL, after he performed Sweet Chin Music. Orton and Michaels were the final two men left from their respective teams. JBL then distracted Michaels, which made Michaels superkick JBL. As Michaels turned around, Orton executed an RKO on Michaels and pinned Michaels to win the match for Team SmackDown!.
Following the match, SmackDown! superstars came to the ring to celebrate with Orton. Druids then came out carrying a casket. The casket was erected and struck by lightning before The Undertaker emerged from the flaming casket. He entered the ring and attacked several of the superstars while Orton and his father "Cowboy" Bob Orton escaped from being the ring, in process preventing the Undertaker's attack.
Aftermath.
After losing the five-on-five Survivor Series match to the SmackDown! brand, Eric Bischoff was fired by Vince McMahon on the December 5 episode of "Raw". The rivalry between the brands ended, and McMahon took the spot as the temporary general manager of Raw. Before being fired by Vince McMahon, Bischoff proposed the idea for an Elimination Chamber match at New Year's Revolution, and the participants feuded with each other in the weeks following. McMahon soon started to feud with Shawn Michaels when McMahon lauded Michaels for his part in the Montreal Screwjob, and Michaels told McMahon to move on.
After Survivor Series, John Cena and Kurt Angle continued their feud. On the December 12 episode of "Raw", Vince McMahon announced a series of five Elimination Chamber qualifying matches. The first qualifying match was won by Kurt Angle. The second qualifying match was won by Carlito, as he defeated Shelton Benjamin. Shawn Michaels, Chris Masters, and Kane also won their respective matches, and as a result, they were eligible to participate in the Elimination Chamber. After the qualifying matches, Cena was scheduled to face Angle's manager, Daivari in a "You Can't See Me" match, as it would see Cena blindfolded during the match. The match was won by Cena, as he made Daivari submit to the STFU.
Randy Orton and The Undertaker continued their feud, and a Hell in a Cell match, a match that saw both men fight in a ring surrounded by a roofed steel cell, between them at Armageddon was made. Undertaker won the match, and their feud ended. Triple H moved on to feud with The Big Show, and Ric Flair feuded with Edge over the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Chris Benoit continued to feud with Booker T throughout the rest of the year and into 2006, in which their "Best of Seven series" concluded in January. Randy Orton, who was Booker's replacement due to a kayfabe injury, defeated Benoit in the seventh and final match. Booker won the WWE United States Championship as a result, but would lose it to Benoit the following month at No Way Out.

Leisurama house

Leisurama was a line of inexpensive prefabricated housing which was available for purchase through Macy's department store in the United States in the mid-1960s. The precursor to the final design was shown at the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, which provoked the noted Kitchen Debate between Vice President Richard M. Nixon and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev. 
Over 200 Leisurama houses were part of the Culloden Point vacation home development in Montauk, New York, which was constructed between 1963 and 1965 and was subject of a 2005 documentary, titled "Leisurama", broadcast by PBS. Some of the Leisurama homes were exhibited at the 1964 New York World's Fair, Lauderhill, Florida is another location which features numerous Leisurama houses.
Background.
In 1959, Andrew Geller, vice president of the Housing and Home Components department at Loewy/Snaith, supervised the design for the exhibition, the "Typical American House," built at the American National Exhibition in Moscow in 1959. The exhibition home largely replicated a home previously built at 398 Townline Road in Commack, New York, which had been originally designed by Stanley H. Klein for a Long Island-based firm, All-State Properties – later known as Sadkin enterprises – headed by developer Herbert Sadkin. To accommodate visitors to the exhibition, Sadkin hired Loewy's office to modify Klein's floor plan. Geller supervised the work, which "split" the house, creating a way for large numbers of visitors to tour the small house and giving rise to its nickname, Splitnik.
During the exhibition, on July 24, 1959, Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev engaged in what became known as the Kitchen Debate — an informal debate over the merits of capitalism vers socialism, with Khrushchev avowing Americans could not afford the luxury represented by the "Typical American House". Tass, the Soviet news agency said: "There is no more truth in showing this as the typical home of the American worker than, say, in showing the Taj Mahal as the typical home of a Bombay textile worker."
Macy's.
The temporary "Typical American House" exhibit was demolished, and the developer hired William Safire as the company's marketing agent. All-State later hired Geller to design the homes, marketed at Macy's and built on Long Island – leveraging the press coverage from the Russian exhibition.
Visitors to Macy's could view and purchase an entire home – down to and including a 45 piece, eight place setting of Melmac dishware – which was displayed on the ninth floor at the store's Herald Square flagship store . The houses were marketed aggressively, and Sadkin built approximately 200 of the homes in a development called "Culloden Point" in Montauk, New York in 1963 and 1964. All-State went on develop Leisurama homes in an area near Fort Lauderdale, which grew into the city of Lauderhill.
In 2003, The New York Times described the Macy's homes: The package deal included a 730- to 1,200-square-foot house on a 75-by-100-foot lot, as well as state-of-the art appliances, furniture, housewares and everything else a family would need for a weekend in the sun, including toothbrushes and toilet paper. The cost was roughly $13,000 to $17,000.

Yushin Okami

Mixed martial arts career.
Early career.
As an amateur, Okami fought in the pre-"Pride 4" tournament, defeating two opponents before submitting Yuuki Tsutsui in the finals via triangle choke to win the tournament. He began his professional career in 2002, fighting in the GCM promotion and Pancrase as well as making an appearance at "Pride The Best Vol.3", amassing a professional record of 6–0. In 2003 he competed in the ADCC Submission Wrestling World Championship, but was defeated by Matt Lindland. Also in 2003, he suffered his first professional MMA loss to Amar Suloev.
Okami continued fighting in multiple promotions before arriving at Rumble on the Rock, where he entered a 175 lb tournament. Anderson Silva, Frank Trigg, Renato Verissimo, and Jake Shields also competed in the tournament. In the opening round, Okami fought the future UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson Silva. Silva controlled the fight on the feet before Okami secured a takedown. Okami landed a few blows from top position before Silva landed an illegal upkick to Okami's chin while both fighters were grounded, and Silva was in the guard position. Okami's knees were on the ground at the time, making the attack an illegal strike to the head of a downed opponent. Silva later said that the rule had not been properly explained to him before the bout. "When I fought Okami the rules really weren't explained to me properly in the event I was fighting in," said Silva. "You could kick a downed opponent to the groin or to the head when your back's on the ground. So the rules weren't explained to me properly." Referee Troy Mandaloniz held Silva back, and gave the dazed Okami time to recover. Okami could not recover and the fight was declared a disqualification victory for Okami. Silva responded by asserting he "felt it was a cheap, cowardly way of winning," and that "people that were there saw that he was in the condition to come back and keep fighting, and he didn't." Moving on to the next round, he faced the future EliteXC welterweight and Strikeforce Middleweight champion Jake Shields, a tournament favorite. Okami lost a hard-fought majority decision to Shields, who went on to win the tournament.
Ultimate Fighting Championship.
2006–2007.
By 2006, Okami had amassed a record of 16–3 and was the third-ranked Pancrase middleweight fighter. He signed with the UFC and made his debut in the organization on the undercard of "UFC 62", defeating Alan Belcher by unanimous decision. He followed up less than two months later with a bout against Kalib Starnes at "UFC 64". He defeated Starnes by TKO due to strikes in the third round. Okami then signed on to make his third appearance in four months at "UFC 66". His original opponent was to be David Terrell, but Terrell withdrew due to an elbow injury and was replaced by Rory Singer. Okami defeated Singer by submission due to strikes late in the third round.
After three victories in the UFC, Okami made his main card and broadcast debut at "UFC 69" against Mike Swick, who was riding a five-fight win streak in the UFC at the time. Okami won the bout via unanimous decision. Okami then participated in the 2007 ADCC Submission Wrestling World Championship in the 87 kg (191 lb) division, but lost to eventual division winner Demian Maia. In the UFC, however, Okami was riding a four-fight win streak. In his next bout, he faced former UFC Middleweight Champion Rich Franklin at "UFC 72" for the position of the #1 contender in the middleweight division. Franklin controlled the first two rounds, but Okami nearly sunk in a kimura in the third. Ultimately all three judges scored the bout 29–28 in Franklin's favor.
2008–2009.
Okami next faced Jason MacDonald at "UFC 77". MacDonald had also defeated Singer and lost to Franklin in his two previous bouts. Though Dana White said that the winner might earn a title shot, the fight was placed on the undercard, possibly due to the fighters' lack of fan support. Okami dominated the fight with superior stand-up, takedown defense, and ground control en route to a unanimous decision victory.
Okami next faced former UFC middleweight champion Evan Tanner in Tanner's first fight in two years. The fight occurred at "UFC 82" on March 1, 2008 in Columbus, Ohio. After dropping Tanner with a straight left in round 1, Okami landed a knee in the Muay Thai clinch position that knocked out Tanner 3 minutes into round 2.
Okami was scheduled for a rematch with Anderson Silva for the middleweight title at "UFC 90", but he was forced to drop out of the bout due to a broken hand. Patrick Côté was chosen to replace him.> After his recovery, Okami faced 2003 ADCC Absolute Division gold medalist Dean Lister at "UFC 92" and earned a unanimous decision. Lister made frequent attempts to pull guard and take Okami down to the ground, but was not able to secure any submissions. The bout was considered tedious by spectators, but Okami was victorious.
Okami was next scheduled to return at "UFC 98" against Dan Miller, but suffered a torn ligament and was not able to compete.
Okami was next scheduled to return at "UFC 104" against Chael Sonnen. Okami lost to Sonnen via unanimous decision (30–27, 30–27, 30–27). After the fight, Okami trained at Team Quest with Sonnen for one month before returning to Japan. Sonnen stated in an interview “I want to say hello to my brother, Yushin through this interview. I am saddened that he returned to Japan – it feels like I parted with a close friend. Though Yushin lost against me, he came forward and asked to train with me: Is this a Japanese thing? It is admirable that he tried to learn from an opponent who defeated him. While at Team Quest in Portland, he thoroughly handled me during training. I was lucky that I managed to defeat him in our fight. I probably won’t agree to a rematch with him (laughs). The one fighter whom I never want to fight again – that is Yushin Okami.”
2010–2011.
Okami defeated Lucio Linhares via TKO doctor stoppage at "UFC Fight Night 21". In his fight with Linhares, Okami showcased much improved striking skills which led to the stoppage.
On August 1, 2010 Okami defeated Mark Muñoz via split decision in the co-main event at "". Okami was able to stuff most of Muñoz's takedowns and kept the fight standing where he showed superior striking, stunning Muñoz in the third round with a straight right counter.
Okami was expected to face Vitor Belfort on November 13, 2010 at "UFC 122", with the winner facing Anderson Silva for the UFC Middleweight Championship. Belfort was then pulled from the fight, and Nate Marquardt was tapped to make a quick return to the Octagon to face Okami. Okami was able to control the center of the octagon and dictate the pace of the fight en route to a unanimous decision victory in what was a closely contested bout.
Okami faced Anderson Silva at "UFC 134" on August 27, 2011 for the UFC Middleweight Championship. In this match, Okami was rocked badly by a headkick in the first round.

2012–2013.
Okami next faced Tim Boetsch on February 26, 2012 at "UFC 144". While Okami dominated the first two rounds, Boetsch claimed one of the biggest upsets of 2012 in Okami's home country in a brutal flurry of uppercuts from the clinch that left Okami losing in a devastating TKO comeback win for Boetsch in the final frame.
Okami was expected to face Luiz Cane on August 11, 2012 at "UFC 150". However, Cane was forced out of the bout with an injury and replaced by Rousimar Palhares. Palhares was also injured and replaced by Buddy Roberts. Okami won the fight via TKO in the second round.

ground and pound.
Despite of being ranked as a top 10 middleweight by most sources, Okami was released by the UFC on September 27, 2013. When asked via Twitter why he released Okami, UFC President Dana White remarked "Our roster is packed". When asked by Yahoo Sports why he was releasing a highly ranked fighter who had won 3 of his last 4 bouts, White responded: "He was always a tough guy and was right up there, but it's almost like he'd become a gatekeeper. I like Okami, and you've heard me say this many times, that a win over Yushin Okami meant something ... But he was never able to get over the hump and win one of those fights. We have a lot of guys coming in and I've been saying this all year: We have a full roster and there are guys who deserve opportunities. When you bring guys in, someone has to go. That's why these fights are so meaningful." 
World Series of Fighting.
On October 13, 2013, it was announced that Okami signed with World Series of Fighting.
Okami made his WSOF debut at WSOF 9, on March 29 2014, against . He won via arm triangle choke submission in the second round.

Survivor Series (2006)

Survivor Series (2006) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and presented by THQ's "WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2007". It was the twentieth annual Survivor Series event, and it took place on November 26, 2006, at the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
The main match on the SmackDown brand was King Booker versus Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship, which Batista won by pinfall after hitting Booker with the World Heavyweight Championship belt. The main match on the Raw and ECW brand was Team Cena (John Cena, Bobby Lashley, Kane, Sabu and Rob Van Dam) versus Team Big Show (Big Show, Test, Finlay, Montel Vontavious Porter and Umaga) in a 5 on 5 Survivor Series match. Team Cena won the match after Cena pinned Big Show last. The primary match on the SmackDown brand was Chris Benoit versus Chavo Guerrero for the WWE United States Championship, which Benoit won after forcing Guerrero to submit to the Sharpshooter. The main match on the card was Team DX (Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Jeff Hardy, CM Punk and Matt Hardy) versus Team Rated-RKO (Edge, Randy Orton, Johnny Nitro, Mike Knox and Gregory Helms) in a 5 on 5 Survivor Series match. Team DX won the match after Triple H pinned Orton following a Pedigree. This marked the first time since the brand extension that wrestlers from different brands wrestled on the same Survivor Series team.
Background.
The event featured seven professional wrestling matches with outcomes predetermined by WWE script writers. The matches featured wrestlers portraying their characters in planned storylines that took place before, during and after the event. All wrestlers were from either one of the WWE's brands – SmackDown or Raw – the two storyline divisions in which WWE assigned its employees.
The main feud heading into Survivor Series was between John Cena and Umaga. Umaga was Cena's latest challenge after Cena finished off the feud between King Booker and The Big Show at Cyber Sunday. On the November 13 episode of "Raw", Cena and Umaga finally fought in a singles match, but it was interrupted by the ECW Champion The Big Show forcing it to a no-contest.
The secondary feud was the main "SmackDown!" feud between World Heavyweight Champion King Booker and challenger Batista. Batista relinquished his World Heavyweight Championship in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at the Wachovia Center on the January 13 edition of "SmackDown!", the same exact location of Survivor Series because of a triceps injury. King Booker had already faced Batista and retained his championship at two pay-per-views since his return on July 7. This time, Theodore Long announced that the match at Survivor Series would be Batista's last chance to win the championship. Another feud was between The Undertaker and Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy beat The Undertaker at the previous pay-per-view, No Mercy, by disqualification. On the November 10 edition of "SmackDown!", Kennedy challenged Undertaker once more bragging that he beat four World Champions. The match was made into a First blood match.
The ECW brand was building up their "Extreme Elimination Chamber" match. The contestants that were named to face the ECW Champion The Big Show were: Rob Van Dam, Sabu, CM Punk, and Test. The final contestant was revealed on the November 21 edition of "ECW on Sci Fi". It was Bobby Lashley, and he attacked Big Show during the in-ring segment.
Event.
Prior to the event, Lauren Hart sang the United States national anthem. The first match was a non-televised match between Carlito and Charlie Haas. Carlito won the match with a Backcracker. The first match of the night was a four-on-four Survivor Series match between Team Spirit Squad and WWE Legends. Team Spirit Squad included Kenny, Johnny, Nicky, and Mikey, with Mitch overseeing the match and managing the team. WWE Legends, a term used for veterans who are still involved with the company today, consisted of Ric Flair, Sgt. Slaughter, Dusty Rhodes, and Ron Simmons. They were accompanied by Arn Anderson. The first man eliminated from the match was Ron Simmons, who was counted out. The referee immediately kicked out Arn Anderson and Mitch following the elimination. The next men eliminated were, Sgt. Slaughter (WWE Legends), Nicky (Spirit Squad), and Dusty Rhodes (WWE Legends). This left Ric Flair to deal with three Spirit Squad members, Mikey, Kenny, and Johnny, and eliminated them all, giving the WWE Legends team the victory. After the match, all members of the Spirit Squad attacked Flair.
The following match was a singles match between Chris Benoit and Chavo Guerrero for the United States Championship. During the match, Vickie Guerrero was knocked off the apron when Chavo kicked Benoit, who was attempting a Sharpshooter, into her. Benoit retained the title by making Chavo submit to the Crippler Crossface. Next on the card, was Lita's last match as a wrestler. She faced challenger Mickie James in a Women's title bout. James got the victory with a Tornado DDT. After the match, Cryme Tyme came out and sold Lita's personal belongings to the Philly audience which they stole in an earlier backstage segment.
The next match was another traditional Survivor Series match between Team DX (Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Jeff Hardy, Matt Hardy, and CM Punk) versus Team Rated-RKO (Edge, Randy Orton, Johnny Nitro, Gregory Helms, and Mike Knox). Mike Knox was eliminated almost immediately; he was pinned by Shawn Michaels, who performed Sweet Chin Music while Knox was distracted by his then-girlfriend, Kelly Kelly. Johnny Nitro was then eliminated by CM Punk, after Nitro submitted to the Anaconda Vice. Gregory Helms was then eliminated by Matt Hardy, after a Twist of Fate by Matt and a Swanton Bomb from Jeff Hardy. Michaels next eliminated Edge via pinfall after performing Sweet Chin Music. Randy Orton was the final member eliminated from his team, after Sweet Chin Music by Michaels and a Pedigree by Triple H, which led to the pinfall victory for Team DX. Team DX completed a clean sweep of Team RKO, meaning that all five men from Team DX were still left standing at the conclusion of the match. This was the third such match (first in Survivor Series 1990) in Survivor Series history.
The fifth match was a First blood match between Mr. Kennedy and The Undertaker. During the match, Kennedy started to cough up blood, but Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) provided Kennedy with a towel and cleaned the mess in the ring. Referee Charles Robinson did not notice that Kennedy was bleeding, so the match continued. The match ended occurred when interference by MVP caused The Undertaker to bleed, costing him the match. Afterward, The Undertaker took revenge by hitting Kennedy with a steel chair and performing a Tombstone piledriver on him.
The following match was the third traditional Survivor Series match and the second five-on-five match of the night. Team Cena (John Cena, Rob Van Dam, Sabu, Kane, and Bobby Lashley) faced Team Big Show (The Big Show, Test, Umaga, Finlay, and Montel Vontavious Porter). In less than a minute, Umaga was disqualified when he used a television monitor to attack Team Cena. Then, MVP got the boot after a chokeslam by Kane and a Frog Splash by RVD. Test immediately attacked RVD and pinned him, making it four-on-three. Test got eliminated following a big DDT by Sabu six minutes into the match. The Little Bastard ran though and was a distraction, causing Finlay to hit Kane with the shillelagh. Big Show pinned Kane to make the match 2-on-2. Lashley eliminated his first man, Finlay with a spear. Cena and lashley teamed up on Show. They delivered a DDT, and the match finished with John Cena giving his finisher, the FU to Big Show, eliminating him. Team Cena therefore won the final Survivor Series match of the night.
The final match of the night was a World Heavyweight Championship match between King Booker and the challenger, Batista. The stipulation was that if Batista lost, he would not have another chance as long as Booker was the champion. Theodore Long announced before the match, if Booker had been disqualified or counted out, he would lose the championship. Batista went after Booker right when he was entering the ring. Batista nearly powerbombed King Booker's wife, Queen Sharmell, but tossed her aside instead. Booker was about to use the belt, but Batista ended up using the belt and hitting Booker in the face with it. Batista made the pin and regained the World Heavyweight Championship.
Aftermath.
The following night on "Raw", Triple H, Shawn Michaels, and Ric Flair defeated all five members of the Spirit Squad. They were sick and tired of the Spirit Squad, so in a backstage segment, DX locked the male cheerleaders in a travel case and sent them to Ohio Valley Wrestling in Louisville, Kentucky via delivery man. That was the end of the Spirit Squad faction. As for DX's teammates at Survivor Series, The Hardys were challenged by the newly reunited team of MNM (Johnny Nitro and Joey Mercury). Eventually, they had a tag team match at December to Dismember.
Victoria earned a shot at the Women's Championship by defeating Melina, Torrie Wilson, Maria, and Candice Michelle in a battle royal. She eventually lost to the Women's Champion Mickie James at New Year's Revolution.
WWE Champion John Cena was challenged by the undefeated Umaga the next night on "Raw". Cena accepted the challenge and they had the championship match at the next Raw pay-per-view, New Year's Revolution. Cena ended Umaga's winning streak to retain the championship.
On the following episode of "SmackDown!", General Manager Theodore Long announced Kane versus Montel Vontavious Porter in an Inferno match and The Undertaker versus Mr. Kennedy in a Last Ride match at Armageddon. This led to the reunification of the Brothers of Destruction versus Kennedy and MVP on the December 15 episode of "SmackDown!".
The ECW main feud, was between The Big Show and Bobby Lashley who signed a contract to be in the Extreme Elimination Chamber match on the November 14 of "ECW". At December to Dismember, Lashley became the new ECW Champion by winning the Extreme Elimination chamber match.
After defeating King Booker at Survivor Series, Batista would go on to hold the World title for four months, defending it against Mr. Kennedy at the 2007 Royal Rumble. Batista would then finally lose the championship to The Undertaker, the winner of the 2007 Royal Rumble, at WrestleMania 23.

2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game

The 2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 77th playing of the midseason exhibition baseball game between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 11, 2006 at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the home of the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League. The contest was the fifth hosted by the city of Pittsburgh – tying the Indians for the record of most times hosted by a single franchise. The game resulted in the American League defeating the National League 3–2, thus awarding the AL champion (which was eventually the Detroit Tigers) home-field advantage in the 2006 World Series.
Background.
As with each All-Star Game since 1970, the 8 starting position players (with no designated hitter due to playing in an NL stadium) of each league were elected by fan balloting. The remaining players were selected by a players' vote, each league's team manager, and the All-Star Final Vote to add one more player to each roster. In all, 32 players were selected to each league's team, not including players who decline to play due to injuries or personal reasons.
The game was the fourth straight All-Star Game to decide home-field advantage in the World Series. The AL entered the game on a nine-game unbeaten streak (eight wins, with one tie in 2002). Many analysts saw the disparity between the leagues as more pronounced than ever this season, particularly due to the AL's dominance during interleague play, compiling a 154–98 record, the best record for either league in the ten-year history of interleague play.
Rosters.
Players in "italics" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.
Game.
Game summary.
National League starting pitcher Brad Penny set the tone for the evening, striking out Ichiro Suzuki, Derek Jeter, and David Ortiz to start the game. His fastball had uncharacteristic speed, never going below 96 miles per hour, and – aside from a lone curveball – was the only pitch he threw in the first inning. American League pitcher Kenny Rogers wasn't as overpowering as Penny, but still escaped the first relatively unscathed. The AL would get to Penny in the second as Vladimir Guerrero hit an opposite-field solo home run that just cleared the right field fence, giving the AL a 1–0 lead. The NL would respond in the bottom of the inning with David Wright hitting his own solo home run to left field, tying the game at 1–1.
Roy Halladay relieved Rogers in the bottom of the third. It was in this inning when the National League exemplified what it does best: playing small. Alfonso Soriano hit a single with one out and stole second base on Gold Glove catcher Iván Rodríguez. He tried to score on a single by Carlos Beltran, but was thrown out at home plate by Vernon Wells. Beltran would advance to second on the throw, then steal third and score on a wild pitch by Halladay, giving the NL a 2–1 lead.
That lead would seem like enough for the NL for most of the evening. After Roy Oswalt relieved Penny in the third, Brandon Webb, Bronson Arroyo, Brian Fuentes, Derrick Turnbow, and Tom Gordon would each throw an inning of scoreless relief, limiting the AL to just three hits in that span. After Halladay pitched the fourth, Barry Zito, Scott Kazmir, Johan Santana, and B.J. Ryan would also each pitch an inning without giving up a run, with the only baserunner allowed on a walk by Santana, the only walk of the game.
Trevor Hoffman came on to try to earn the save in the ninth. After inducing two groundouts back to himself, it seemed like Hoffman, who, at the time, was second all-time in career saves, would finally send the American League to a loss in an All-Star Game for the first time in a decade. However, Paul Konerko hit a single to left past third baseman Miguel Cabrera, and was pinch-run for by José Lopez. Troy Glaus hit a ground rule double down the left field line, forcing Lopez to hold at third. While it looked like the National League received a break (as Lopez could have possibly scored the tying run if the ball stayed in play), Hoffman allowed a two-strike triple to Michael Young, who went on to win the MVP, scoring Lopez and Glaus and putting the AL up 3–2.
Mariano Rivera would now try to save the game for the American League. Because Lopez pinch-ran for Konerko in the top of the ninth, the American League was left without any first basemen on the roster. Glaus, in the game as a third baseman, moved to first for the bottom of the inning, a position he never played before in his career, while Lopez played third. Despite an error made by Lopez, Rivera pitched a quiet ninth to earn the save and extend the American League's unbeaten streak to ten games.
Home Run Derby.
The Century 21 Real Estate Home Run Derby was held on the Monday before the game, July 10. Four players from each league competed to hit as many home runs in each round to advance and eventually win the contest. This year's Derby featured an important rule change: home runs in the first round would carry over into the second round. In previous years, some players would hit a tremendous amount of home runs in the first round, but become tired by the second round and hit relatively fewer home runs for that round, often not enough to qualify for the finals. By allowing the home runs to carry over, a player can't necessarily be "punished" for hitting an impressive total in the first round. However, like in previous Derbies, the two finalists start over at zero for the finals.
In the finals, Ryan Howard of the Philadelphia Phillies defeated David Wright of the New York Mets 5–4, and hit a total of 23 home runs on the night, leading all competitors. Howard memorably hit his winning home run into a sign guaranteeing one person in the crowd 500 free round-trip flights from Southwest Airlines.
PNC Park is distinct for having the Allegheny River running behind the right field bleachers. As a result, several balls were hit into the river on the fly (a feat that had only been accomplished once before in the stadium's regular-season history), as well as many more bouncing off the walkway alongside the river. Many fans waited in the river in canoes hoping to retrieve a ball, a sight more reminiscent of the following year's All-Star Game and Home Run Derby site, AT&T Park.
For the second straight year, gold balls were utilized whenever a player had one out remaining in the round. Any home runs hit with the gold ball meant Major League Baseball and Century 21 would pledge to donate $21,000 (US) to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and Easter Seals, respectively. In all, 14 gold-ball home runs were hit, constituting $294,000 raised for both charities.
Other events.
Futures Game.
The eighth annual XM Satellite Radio Futures Game was held on Sunday, July 9, showcasing the top minor league prospects from all thirty major league clubs. Game MVP Billy Butler of the Kansas City Royals farm system hit a two-run home run to help lead the United States team to an 8–5 victory over the World team.
Roberto Clemente ceremony.
Commissioner Bud Selig presented the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award to deceased Pittsburgh Pirates legend Roberto Clemente between the fourth and fifth innings of the All-Star Game. Clemente's widow, Vera, accepted the award. FOX play-by-play announcer Joe Buck emceed the ceremony. As a result, he called the bottom of the fourth inning from the entrance behind home plate. Buck created a little controversy when after Vera Clemente spoke what many said was a beautiful, moving speech Buck asked the fans "You guys having fun out here?!"

<doc id="5943292" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5943292" title="Diyya">
Diyya

Diya (plural: Diyat; ) is financial compensation paid to the heirs of a victim. In Arabic, the word means both blood money and ransom.
Islamic and Arab tradition.
The Qur'an specifies the principle of Qisas (i.e. retaliation), but prescribes that one should seek compensation ("Diyya") and not demand retribution. 
The Qur'an directed to pay Diyyat just according to this law both in case of intentional as well as un-intentional murder. A variation of Diyat was present in pre-Islamic Arabia, where it was paid in terms of goods or animals rather than cash. In Sharia law, Diyat should be paid in terms of cash to avoid possible fraud on the part of the criminal. In Islamic and Arab traditions, blood money is the fine paid by the killer or his family or clan to the family or the clan of the victim (comparable to the traditions of weregild and główszczyzna). It is unlawful for a believer to kill a believer except if it happens by accident. And he who kills a believer accidentally must pay Diyyat to the heirs of the victim except if they forgive him. The tradition finds repeated endorsement in Islamic tradition; several instances are recorded in the Hadith, which are the acts of Muhammad.
There is no specific amount for Diyat and the fine does not differ based on the gender, victim, or state of freedom of the victim. However, the Qur'an leaves open its quantity, nature and other related affairs to the customs and traditions of a society. The Qur'an directs to pay Diyat according to this law both in case of intentional as well as unintentional murder.
The four Sunni legal schools of thought debated what should be the Diyya for a Jew or Christian, who were considered Dhimmi. According to the Shafi school, the Diyya in such a case was a third paid for a Muslim. The Maliki prescribed half. The Hanafi school, on the other hand, does not differentiate between a Muslim and non-Muslim. In Yemen, the Diyya for a Jew was sometimes much higher than for a Muslim, since he was considered a protege of the tribe, and any injury to him was considered injury to the whole tribe.
Legally prescribed rates.
Countries whose law follows the Shari'a, including Saudi Arabia, Iran and Pakistan, also enacted laws for Qisas and Diyat. In Saudi Arabia, for example, the heirs of the victim have a right to settle for Diya instead of the execution of the murderer. The customary law of the Somali people also recognizes the obligation of "diya", but define it as being between subgroups, or "mag", who may be part of different clans or even the same clan.
Some of these countries also define, by lawful legislation, a hierarchy of rates for the lives of people; religious affiliation and gender are usually the main modulating factors for these Blood Money rates. Some examples are presented below.
Saudi Arabia.
In Saudi Arabia, when a person has been killed or caused to die by another, the prescribed blood money rates are as follows:
The amount of compensation is based on the percentage of responsibility. Blood money is to be paid not only for murder, but also in case of unnatural death, interpreted to mean death in a fire, industrial or road accident, for instance, as long as the responsibility for it falls on the causer.
Iran.
In Iran, a further refinement on the hierarchy of rates has been devised: variations are also based on the "month" of the Islamic calendar that the crime is committed in. The Iranian Judiciary system announces a table of the prescribed amounts each year. During the four "haraam" months, when wars and killings were traditionally discouraged in the Arabian Peninsula and later in the larger Islamic world, the blood money rates stand doubled. The rates for female victims is half that for male victims in murder cases, but equal in cases of insurance and accidental death.
As in Saudi Arabia, the rates for bloody crimes committed against Iranian non-Muslims used to be half the rate prescribed for Muslim victims, but this was changed by "equitable", progressive-minded legislation in early 2004. This legislation was initially rejected by the Guardian Council but was later approved by the Expediency Discernment Council. "In 2004 the Expediency Council approved appending a note to Article 297 of the 1991 Islamic Punishments Act, authorizing collection of equal "blood money" (diyeh) for the death of Muslims and non-Muslims." 
However, members of the Bahá'í Faith are excluded from the provisions of the equalization legislation and as such no blood money is payable to families of Baha'is who are murdered. "All women and Baha'i men were excluded from the equalization provisions of the bill. According to law, Baha'i blood is considered Mobah, meaning it can be spilled with impunity." 
Iraq.
In Iraq, the Bedouin tribes carry on the practice of demanding blood money, though this does not necessarily obviate the proceedings of the secular judicial system.

Illegal Alien (song)

"Illegal Alien" is a song by English rock group by Genesis. It was released as the fourth single from the album "Genesis". The song reached number 46 in the UK charts.
Content.
The song's lyrics are a lighter, humorous depiction of the frustrations an illegal immigrant faces, leading up to the chorus: "It's no fun being an illegal alien". The song is rarely played on United States radio stations because of its perceived offensiveness toward illegal immigrants. In particular, the second stanza of the bridge — in which the trespasser offers sexual favours from his sister in exchange for admittance across the border — has been edited from radio versions of the song, as well as from the music video version.
Phil Collins played trumpet and Tony Banks used Emulator sampler recording the song.
Music video.
The video uses stereotypical portrayals of Mexicans, with the participants (including Collins) shown drinking, sleeping, playing Mariachi music, wearing huge sombreros and serapes, and singing in mock-Mexican accents. The clip was filmed at the same time as the video for "Mama".
Live performances.
"Illegal Alien" was only played live during the "Mama" Tour. A live version is featured on Disc Two of , which was recorded live at the L.A. Forum, Los Angeles on 14 January 1984.

Tipi-tii

"Tipi-tii" ("Chirpy chirp") was the Finnish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1962, performed in Finnish by Marion Rung, composed by Kari Tuomisaari, who also wrote the lyrics. The song is the very first hit in Marion Rung's long career.
The song is a plea for all listeners to join in "the call of love", with Rung likening everyone to a group of birds singing their song together.
Performed first on the night of the Eurovision final, preceding Belgium's Fud Leclerc with "Ton nom", "Tipi-tii" had at the close of voting received 4 points, placing 7th in a field of 16.
"Tipi-tii" was the first of five Finnish Eurovision entrants to become a #1 hit in Finland, the next being the Eurovision 1973 entrant "Tom Tom Tom" also sung by Marion Rung, followed by "Reggae OK" by Riki Sorsa (Eurovision 1981), "Hard Rock Hallelujah" by Lordi (Eurovision 2006), and "Lose Control" by Waldo's People (Eurovision 2009).
The succeeding Finnish representative at the 1963 Contest by Laila Halme with "Muistojeni laulu".

Stephenson played primarily with the Canadian National Team early in his career, and was a member of the 1968 Canadian Olympic Hockey Team that won the Bronze Medal.
Stephenson graduated from the University of Winnipeg with an economics degree and worked as an accountant. After he retired from professional hockey, he worked in the banking industry.
His NHL career would begin in 1971 when he was signed as a free agent by the St. Louis Blues. After three seasons with the Blues, he was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers. While in Philadelphia, Wayne toiled as a backup to Bernie Parent for the 1974-1975 season. When Parent suffered a pinched nerve in his neck during the 1975-1976 pre season that required surgery, Stephenson became the Flyers starting goaltender and retained the job when Parent returned late in the season but couldn't regain his previous All Star form. During that year, Stephenson allowed one goal in the Flyer's win over the Soviet Red Army hockey team, a victory Stephenson referred to as the highlight of his career. Stephenson sought a salary increase to reflect his new responsibilities and value to the team in 1976 but management held firm and he returned to the Philadelphia lineup after a two month holdout. The friction generated by the dispute fueled his exit from Philadelphia. Stephenson was traded to the Washington Capitals prior to the 1979–80 NHL season and played there for two seasons before retiring.
Stephenson died from brain cancer. He was married for 39 years to his wife Nedina and had four children, two sons and two daughters.

France Silva

Private France Silva (May 8, 1876 – April 10, 1951) born in Haywards, California, was the first Marine of Mexican-American and Hispanic heritage to receive the Medal of Honor. He received the Medal of Honor for his meritorious conduct in China during the Boxer Rebellion.
Medal of Honor action.
Silva joined the Marine Corps on September 12, 1899, in San Francisco and attended Boot Camp at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. He was assigned to the U.S. Flag Ship "Newark" where Private Daniel Joseph Daly (future double Medal of Honor recipient) was already a member. They became good friends. The "Newark" soon headed to the Philippines, to take part in the Spanish-American War, but were then sent to Japan to prepare for a landing at Taku, Tientsen and Peking. They arrived in Peking on May 31 before the Boxers closed the city off from the world.
In 1900, Private France Silva was a member of the Legation Guards (Marines) under the command of Captain Newt Hall, aboard the . The USS "Newark" was a United States Navy protected cruiser, the first modern cruiser in the U.S. fleet. On May 20, 1900, the "Newark" sailed for China to help land allied troops to assist civilians within the legations which came under siege by the Boxers at Peking. Arriving Tientsin on May 22.
As Captains John T. Meyers and Newt H. Hall, USMC – under the command of Captain Bowman McCalla, USN – were in the lead position of the allies, the all European Brass Band played, "There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight". They had their last really good meal for a couple of months but also immediately posted guard. Captain Meyers had given the command, "Fix, Bayonets!" just before their approach. They double timed the last three-hundred yards and the crowd cheered.
Later, when they entered the Forbidden City of Peking, Edwin Conger, the lead U.S. Diplomat (and former Army officer) said to Meyers, "Thank God you are here. Now we are safe."
On June 19, 1900, the 1st Regiment (Marines) under Major Littleton Waller, USMC, attempted to take the city of Tientsin and failed. Then on June 23, the Regiment, under the command of Major Waller, was able to enter Tientsin in their second attempt and force the Chinese forces to retreat to Peking. Private France Silva, several other Marines and two sailors, Navy Seamen Axel Westermark and Chief Machinist Emil Peterson earned the Medal of Honor in their defense of the civilian compound (legation) at Peking. They defended the walled city from June 28 until the fall of the city which occurred on August 17.
In accordance to a newspaper article: "The USS Newark placed ashore a contingent of Marine and three bluejackets as a legation guard. These men and later another detachment of Marines, soldiers and sailors joined the troops of other western countries and Japan in the defense of other Peking legations against the Boxers until the arrival of the Allied Forces in August."
According to the Journal of Pvt. Oscar J. Upham, USMC, (Upham called his journal the "Siege of Peking") on July 1, "Pvt. Silva of the Newark Guard (detachment) volunteered to go and assist them (others on the Tartar Wall) and was hit in the arm making a very bad wound." Several others had been seriously wounded and some killed during this skirmish. According to documents in the National Archives and Records Administration the bullet entered Pvt. Silva's left elbow and bounced off his sternum. He was medically discharged on January 6, 1901 at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, CA. On December 31, 1901, he was awarded the Medal of Honor, also at Mare Island (Medal of Honor Society). The Medal of Honor Society stated recently (November 2008) that the Medal of Honor was mailed to him, but there is no official information about which official presented at Mare Island.
Captain Newt Hall, USMC, was Pvt. Silva's Commanding Officer aboard the Newark. Hall retired as a Colonel and many years later (1930s) wrote an account of the Siege of Peking. Of all the Marines under his charge he noted that Silva's was the "most interesting." Even though Pvt. Silva was badly injured (he couldn't hold his rifle because his elbow had taken the bullet and it passed through his arm and bounced off his sternum), he and several other Marines attempted to return to the Wall for action. Captain Hall ordered them back to (Sick Bay).
Silva refused, telling the captain that if he would take Silva's rifle and the captain give him his pistol, he said, "I can take of myself." Silva remained on duty for at least a day relieving Marines and others on the Wall giving them a "much needed rest."
Pvt. Silva's immediate Commanding Officer was Capt. Newt Hall. Hall was under the command of Capt. John T. Myers. Myer's and his detachment were on the USS Oregon (Upham Journal).
Medal of Honor citation.

Postscript.
After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Silva reported that he lost all of his papers and his Medal of Honor, but another was mailed to him. He had filed a disability claim with the Department of Veterans Affairs.
France Silva died on April 10, 1951 and is buried in Sunset Hill Cemetery in Corning, California.
A model of the American Legation, previously on display at the Navy Yard in the early 1990s, was donated to the Marine Corps League, Detachment 1140, Tehama/Red Bluff (CA). This model of the American Legation was then donated to the Northern California Veterans Museum in Redding.

New Jersey Casino Control Commission

The Casino Control Commission is a New Jersey state governmental agency that was founded in 1977 as the state's gaming control board, responsible under the Casino Control Act for licensing casinos in Atlantic City. The commission also issues licenses for casino key employees and hears appeals from decisions of the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. The commission is headquartered in the Arcade Building at Tennessee Avenue and Boardwalk in Atlantic City.
On November 15, 2010, State Senators James Whelan (D-2nd) and Raymond Lesniak (D-20th) introduced Senate Bill S12 to change the New Jersey Casino Control Act and deregulate the Atlantic City casino industry to improve competitiveness with casinos in other states. The bill would also transfer day-to-day regulatory functions from the Casino Control Commission to the Division of Gaming Enforcement. After hearings in both houses of the Legislature, the bill was approved on January 10, 2011 and signed into law by Governor Chris Christie on February 1, 2011.
The new law eliminated the requirement for the commission to have inspectors in casinos around-the-clock and made the Division of Gaming Enforcement responsible for certifying gaming revenue. The Division of Gaming Enforcement also took over responsibility for registering casino employees and non-gaming vendors, licensing gaming vendors, and handling all patron complaints.
Commissioners.
The Casino Control Commission consists of three members appointed by the Governor of New Jersey with advice and consent of the New Jersey Senate. The number of commissioners was reduced from five on January 17, 2012.
Commissioners serve staggered, five-year terms and can only be removed for cause. By law, no more than two commissioners can be of the same political party, a requirement that is intended to ensure political balance on the panel. 
One commissioner is appointed by the Governor to also serve as a member of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority (CRDA). A second commissioner may be appointed by the Governor to serve as a member of the CRDA in lieu of the commissioner of the Department of Commerce and Economic Development or the Department of Community Affairs.

Jake Shields

Jake Shields (born January 9, 1979) is an American mixed martial artist, currently fighting in the welterweight division for the World Series of Fighting. He was the last Rumble on the Rock Welterweight Champion, the only Elite XC Welterweight Champion, a former Shooto Welterweight Champion and former Strikeforce Middleweight Champion. He also fought for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).
He has trained extensively with Fairtex SF and Cesar Gracie, and is a member of the "Skrap Pack" which includes fellow Cesar Gracie students Dave Terrell, Nick Diaz, Nate Diaz and Gilbert Melendez. After his loss to Akira Kikuchi he won 15 consecutive fights over six years, until his loss to Georges St-Pierre. He describes his style as American Jiu-jitsu.
Early life.
Shields was raised near Mountain Ranch California in the Sierra Nevada. He was home schooled up to junior high. He and his two older brothers grew up at the end of a dirt road on the rim of the Jesus Maria Canyon. Their nearest friends were a 45 minute hike down one side of the canyon and up the other. Their activities included mountain biking, wild caving, snowboarding, clearing brush, bucking firewood, climbing mountains, exploring the high country, and wrestling.
Shields began amateur wrestling at age nine. He has competed in over 600 folk, freestyle, and submission wrestling matches. Shields was a four-year varsity wrestler and state qualifier at Calaveras High School, finished 2nd place at the Amateur Athletic Union National Freestyle Championships, qualified for U.S.A./ FILA Nationals & World Team Trials in both the junior & university men's divisions. He is also a two time All American wrestler from Cuesta College, placing 4th in the state tournament in the 177 lb weight class in 1997 and 3rd in the 197 lb weight class a year later. In September 1999, Shields began his MMA training by joining Chuck Liddell's SLO Kickboxing Academy. Within a few weeks he fought his first fight, filling in for an injured teammate at 185 lbs. Shields fought five fights at 185 lbs "for fun, to stay in shape and learn some self defense". In 2001, Shields decided he wanted to make a career of mixed martial arts and began fighting at his natural weight of 170 lbs (77 kg).
In the summer of 2001, Shields received a wrestling scholarship to San Francisco State University. At that time he began training with the Cesar Gracie Fight Team, resulting in a dramatic improvement in his jiu jitsu. He is a three time Grapplers Quest Advance Champion, Pan American Championships Jiu Jitsu Champion, Pan Am Open Advance Submission Champion, Gracie Open Superfight Champion and finished 3rd place at the ADCC Submission Wrestling World Championship in 2005. His victory at the Pan American Championships (which requires wearing a uniform) as a purple belt is notable because Jake Shields claims he has trained "about four hours with the gi in life," and the Pan Americans is one of the largest Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu competitions in the world. He continued to improve on the kickboxing skills he picked up with Chuck Liddell, by cross-training with the professional Muay Thai kickboxing team at the Fairtex combat Academy, training with Muay Thai Champions Jongsanan Fairtex and Alex Gong. He was awarded the rank of black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu by Cesar Gracie in February 2007.
Shields was the head instructor of BJJ (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu) and MMA at the Fairtex-Gracie affiliate in San Francisco from March 2002 until April 2008.
Shields has developed a style of fighting called "American Jiu-Jitsu" which he has tattooed on his forearm. Shields' American Jiu-Jitsu is a no-gi style of grappling for MMA and self-defense is a complete combat art that combines the relaxed and ready position and submission techniques of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu with the explosive takedowns, throws and transitions of wrestling. Shields has an iron chin which was best displayed in his fight with Dan Henderson where he took numerous big shots from Hendo in the 1st round and came back to win the next 4 rounds and get a unanimous decision victory.
Mixed martial arts.
Shields is best known for his 15-fight winning streak, finishing eight of his eleven opponents before being defeated by UFC welterweight champion Georges St-Pierre in a hard fought five round battle at UFC 129. Shields has captured the Shooto World Mixed Martial Arts Championship and the Rumble on the Rock World Championship. He submitted Nick Thompson via guillotine choke in a bout for the Elite XC Welterweight Championship.
At he fought EliteXC's last middleweight champion and former two-time ICON Sport middleweight champion at a catchweight of . Lawler took the center of the cage and looked comfortable on his feet. Robbie Lawler said in the post fight interview, "His striking was good. He threw a lot of kicks. He worked. He threw hands and wasn't shying away from standup, that's for sure." Two minutes into the first round, Shields pounced and secured a guillotine choke to finish his opponent via submission at 2:02 of the first round.
At he fought Jason 'Mayhem' Miller for the vacant Strikeforce Middleweight Championship after Cung Le stepped down as champion to pursue his acting career. Shields defeated Miller via unanimous decision (49–46, 49–46, 48–47).
Shields successfully defended his title, defeating former Pride World Welterweight Champion Dan Henderson via unanimous decision on April 17, 2010, at .
Ultimate Fighting Championship.
Shields was spotted and shown on camera next to UFC President Dana White at the WEC 48 PPV. With Dana White saying, "He's mine!" and his arm around Shields, this fueled rumors of Shields signing with the UFC. Jake Shields stated in an interview that it was tough for Strikeforce to provide him with exciting fights and this would be a key aspect in his decision to stay or leave. Dana White also stated in this interview he would be willing to pay huge sums to strip away one of Strikeforce's champions. This has further fueled speculation that Shields would leave Strikeforce for the UFC.
On June 30, Strikeforce released Shields from the organization during his contract renegotiation period. Shields then entered into talks with the UFC, with his manager and father Jack Shields stating that his son is eager to fight against top UFC fighters, such as Anderson Silva. In July 2010, it was reported that Shields was close to signing a deal with the Ultimate Fighting Championship to compete in the promotion's Welterweight division.
Shields made his UFC debut against Martin Kampmann on October 23, 2010, at UFC 121: Lesnar vs. Velasquez. Prior to Shields's UFC debut, Dana White stated that Shields is most likely next for a shot at the UFC Welterweight Championship between the winner of Georges St. Pierre vs. Josh Koscheck if he defeats Kampmann. After Shields defeated Kampmann via split decision, White later confirmed that Shields would receive a title shot against the winner of the Georges St-Pierre vs. Josh Koscheck fight at UFC 124.
Georges St-Pierre won his UFC 124 bout against Josh Koscheck. Shields fought St-Pierre for the UFC Welterweight Championship on April 30, 2011, at UFC 129 in Toronto. Shields lost via unanimous decision (50–45, 48–47, 48–47). This was Shields's first loss in over 6 years.
Shields faced Jake Ellenberger on September 17, 2011 at UFC Fight Night 25, losing via first round TKO. This was the first time Shields has been finished in over ten years.
Shields faced Yoshihiro Akiyama on February 26, 2012 at UFC 144, winning via unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-27).
Shields returned to the middleweight division and faced Ed Herman on August 11, 2012 at UFC 150. He won the bout via unanimous decision. However, on October 12, 2012, it was announced that Jake Shields had failed his drug test at UFC 150 and he was subsequently fined and suspended. The result of the fight was overturned to a No Contest.
Shields faced Tyron Woodley in a welterweight bout on June 15, 2013 at UFC 161. The bout was contested on the feet for nearly its entirety in a largely uneventful fight where neither fighter was able to deliver any significant offense. Shields defeated Woodley via split decision.
Shields next faced Demian Maia on October 9, 2013 at UFC Fight Night 29. As expected, the contest between the two decorated jiu jitsu practitioners took place mostly on the ground, and Shields won a close split decision (48-47, 47-48, 48-47).
Shields fought Hector Lombard on March 15, 2014 at UFC 171. Shields lost the fight via unanimous decision.
On April 6, 2014, it was announced that Shields was released from the promotion.
After his release from the UFC, the outspoken and often candid president of the organization, Dana White, had this to say about Shields: 
"We look at everything. Everything. Money has something to do with it. I'd be lying if I said it didn't. But that wasn't the only reason or the main reason. It was a part of the piece of the puzzle as we were doing our evaluation of him. Mixed martial arts is a young man's game. I like Jake Shields a lot. But let's be honest here: Where was he going in this division of animals we have? He's on the downswing, and he's never going to be the guy. His stand-up never improved. He hasn't really shown anything in his last couple of fights to make you go, 'Holy [expletive.' Right now, at this point, he's just another guy."
World Series of Fighting.
In April 2014, Shields signed a multi-fight deal with the World Series of Fighting. Shields was expected to compete at WSOF 11 on July 5, 2014 against Jon Fitch. However, Shields was forced out of the bout due to a shoulder injury.
Personal life.
Shields is a single father to an eleven-year-old daughter. He opened a studio in Berkeley called Shields' Gracie Fighter MMA and Fitness, but no longer teaches there and is not affiliated in any way. He is a lifelong vegetarian. He appeared in both print and video ads for PETA, touting his vegetarian lifestyle.
On August 29, 2011 Shields' father and manager Jack Shields passed away at the age of 67.
Television and film.
Jake Shields stars in and co-produced "Fight Life", an award-winning documentary on the sport of MMA, the film is directed by James Z. Feng and released in 2013. Shields appeared in three episodes of "Bully Beatdown" on MTV and MTV2 on April 12, 2009, a different episode on September 10, and again on an mtv.com exclusive episode. Shields also served as a grappling coach for Chuck Liddell on "The Ultimate Fighter 11", and appeared on the channel Animal Planet for episodes of "Wild Recon" and "Venom in Vegas".

Onesimos Nesib

Onesimos Nesib (in Oromo orthography, Onesimoos Nasiib; about 1856 – 21 June 1931), was a native Oromo who converted to Lutheran Christianity and translated the Christian Bible into the Oromo language. His parents named him Hika as a baby, meaning "Translator"; he took the name "Onesimus", after the Biblical character, upon converting to Christianity.
Onesimos Nesib is included in the American "Lutheran Book of Worship" as a saint, who commemorate his life 21 June. The Mekane Yesus Church honored him by naming their seminary in Addis Ababa for him.
Life.
Born near Hurumu in modern Ethiopia, Onesimos lost his father when he was four years old. According to an account he later wrote for the Board of the Swedish Evangelical Mission, he was kidnapped by slavers in 1869, and passed through the hands of eight owners until Werner Munzinger freed him at Massawa (in modern Eritrea) and had him educated at the Imkullu Swedish Evangelical Mission in that port city. There he proved a good student, and eventually received baptism on Easter Sunday (31 March 1872). He was sent to Johannelunds Teologiska Högskola in Bromma, Sweden for five years to receive further education; upon his return to Massawa, he married Mehret Hailu.
He attempted to immediately return to his native Macha Oromo people, and to circumvent the travel restrictions Emperor Menelik II had imposed on foreign missionaries attempted to reach Welega by way of central Sudan. His party got no closer than Asosa, and were forced to return to the border town of Famaka, where Onesimos suffered from a fever. The party was forced back to Khartoum, which they reached on 10 April 1882 just as the Mahdist revolt broke out. Onesimos recovered from his illness, and found his way back to the Imkullu Mission, where while waiting further instructions he began the first of his many translations into Oromo. After attempting another unsuccessful mission to reach Welega in 1886, he began his translation of the entire Bible.
Unfortunately, Onesimos found that he lacked adequate knowledge of the words and idioms of his native language for he had not lived with his people since childhood, and he was forced to seek help. This came from Aster Ganno (1874–1964), a young girl who had been had brought to Imkullu Mission, freed from a slave ship bound for Yemen by the Italian navy. Although she provided much of the material for the translation (which was published in 1893), Aster failed to receive any acknowledgement for her contributions.
It was not until 1904 that Onesimos at last returned to Welega a place called Nedjo, where he was greeted with great honor by its governor, Dejazmach Gebre Egziabher. Unlike his predecessor, Onesimos preached to his flock in the Oromo language, which the local Ethiopian Orthodox priests could not understand, and incurred their hostility. This, combined with the esteem the local Oromo had for him, led to the priests alleging that he was blaspheming the Virgin Mary. He was brought before Abuna Mattheos in May 1906, who ordered that he be exiled upon the accusations of the local clergy. However Emperor Menelik reversed the Abuna's decision, and ruled that Onesimos could return to Nekemte, but could no longer preach.
While Onesimos limited his public actions in the next few years to teaching in his school at Nekemte, the threat of exile from his homeland continued to hang over his head until 1916 when Lij Iyasu granted him permission to preach his faith. Although Lij Iyasu was deposed the next year from his position as designated (but uncrowned) Emperor, his edict was not rescinded, and Onesimos continued to distribute his translations and preach until his death.

That's All (Genesis song)

"That's All" is a song by Genesis. The song, a group composition with lyrics written by lead singer/drummer Phil Collins, appears as the second track on their 1983 album "Genesis", and was its second single after "Mama".
The US single, which went to number six in early 1984 (making it their first US top-10 hit), included "Second Home by the Sea" as the B-side. The UK single featured "Taking It All Too Hard" as the flipside, and went to number 16. Another single version included a live version of "Firth of Fifth" from 1981.
The song was intended as an attempt to write a simple pop song with a melody in the style of The Beatles. Phil Collins acknowledged in subsequent interviews that the song also features one of his attempts at a "Ringo Starr drum part".
The song begins with Tony Banks playing the main riff of the song on a Yamaha CP-70 Electric Grand Piano. The other keyboards used on this song are a Sequential Circuits Prophet-10 for organ pads and a Synclavier II for the organ solo in the middle section. The coda lapses into a somewhat dischordant guitar solo played by Mike Rutherford, as the drum beat intensifies, before the song fades away.
The video depicts the band as homeless men playing cards and keeping warm at an open fire. It was the first time Genesis used director Jim Yukich (Phil's former director) for one of their promos.
Live performances.
The song was played live during the "Mama", "Invisible Touch", "The Way We Walk", and "Calling All Stations" (with Ray Wilson on vocals) Tours.
The song was played only during the first few shows of the "Calling All Stations" tour, before it was completely dropped.
A live version appears on their albums "", and their DVD "Genesis Live at Wembley Stadium", as well as their home video "The Mama Tour";
The first verse of the song is also part of the "Old Medley" featured on "" and "The Way We Walk - Live in Concert".
Other versions.
Keane performed a live version of the song as a tribute to Genesis at the VH1 Rock Honors in 2007.
Canadian country music group Doc Walker covered the song on their 2008 album "Beautiful Life". It was released as the second single from the project and peaked at No. 68 on the Canadian Hot 100.
Canadian indie rock band Zeus covered the song on their 2009 debut EP Sounds Like Zeus.
Clare & the Reasons covered the song on their second album, "Arrow", released in 2009.
American Idol contestant Phillip Phillips performed the song during '80s week on the eleventh season.

Down and Dirty

Down and Dirty is the fifth book in the "Wild Cards" anthology series, set in the same shared universe as the other Wild Cards novels and collections. It was edited by George R. R. Martin.
The stories in this volume tell of the events in New York City involving two outbreaks; the outbreak of a gang war between the Mafia and the Shadow Fists gangs controlled by Kien Phuc, a war which soon spills out of control into the streets of New York. Against this backdrop, the second outbreak occurs; the outbreak of a new, mutant strain of Wild Card virus, courtesy of the ever-shifting powers of The Sleeper, "Typhoid Croyd" Crenson. This version is different in that it can overwrite the original strain, so that even Aces and Jokers are not safe.
Stories.
The stories "Only the Dead Know Jokertown", "All the King's Horses", "Concerto for Siren and Serotonin", and "Blood Ties" are told in recurring chapters which alternate with the other stories throughout the book.

Vortex (Kings Island)

Vortex is a steel roller coaster at Kings Island located in Mason, Ohio. Designed and built by Arrow Dynamics at a cost of $4 million, the ride officially opened to the public on April 11, 1987. Vortex debuted as the tallest, full-circuit roller coaster with the highest drop in the world. It was also the first to feature six inversions.
Vortex occupies the same location in the park once held by The Bat, the world's first suspended roller coaster. Attendance at the park exceeded 3 million in 1987 for the first time in the park's history. With more than 38 million rides given, the roller coaster is one of the most popular attractions at Kings Island to date.
History.
For the design and construction of Vortex, Kings Island turned to Arrow Dynamics, an industry-leading manufacturer at the time. Construction began in the winter of 1986 on the former location of The Bat, the world's first suspended roller coaster that was removed after the 1984 season. Kings Island invested over $4 million on the ride that required 750 tons of steel to construct. The line queue and train station from The Bat were reused for the Vortex. The ride opened to the public on April 11, 1987, and helped the park exceed 3 million visitors for the first time in its history. At its inauguration, Vortex briefly set a few records for full-circuit roller coasters. It was the tallest, featured the highest drop, and had the most inversions with six. All were surpassed the following year with the debut of Shockwave at Six Flags Great America.
Vortex has been repainted at least twice: during the 2001 season and again in April 2009 before opening day. The ride celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2012, and since its debut, Vortex has given more than 38 million rides – sixth-most in Kings Island's history.
Ride experience.
As the train leaves the station, it dips slightly taking a hard right into the beginning of the lift hill. The train ascends slowly giving riders a view of the park including The Beast to the left, Diamondback straight ahead, and the Eiffel Tower to the right. Once reaching the top, the train dips slightly, immediately making a right hand turn into a 138 ft, 55-degree nosedive down the first drop. The train then ascends into a left-banking turn as the track flattens out. After turning roughly 180 degrees, the track straightens briefly before descending into a sharp left turn that takes riders through two consecutive loops. Upon exiting the second loop, the train ascends to a level portion of the track that makes a sudden right turn into a set of midcourse brakes that slow the train almost to a complete stop. Next, the train drops off the midcourse brakes into the two corkscrews. After the corkscrews, the train goes through a batwing inversion, a heart-shaped element containing both a dive loop and an immelmann loop, that inverts riders two additional times. An on-ride camera is featured in between both inversions. The train then enters its final maneuver – a 450-degree ascending clockwise helix – that generates positive g forces before slamming into the final brake run stopping the train abruptly. A final right-hand turn is made to re-enter the station.
Incidents.
On Saturday, July 2, 2011, damage to Vortex's chain lift was detected by a computer as a train was pulling out of the station. The ride was stopped and all passengers were able to safely exit. The ride remained closed for several weeks while a replacement part was on order.

Papercutting

Papercutting is the art of cutting paper designs. The art has evolved uniquely all over the world to adapt to different cultural styles.
History.
The oldest surviving paper cut out is a symmetrical circle from the 6th century Six Dynasties period found in Xinjiang China. Papercutting continued to be practiced during the Song and Tang Dynasties as a popular form of decorative art. By the eighth or ninth century papercutting appeared in West Asia and in Turkey in the 16th century. Within a century, papercutting was being done in most of middle Europe.
Chinese.
Jianzhi (剪紙), is a traditional style of papercutting in China. Jianzhi has been practiced in China since at least the 6th century A.D. Jianzhi has a number of distinct uses in Chinese culture, almost all of which are for health, prosperity or decorative purposes. Red is the most commonly used color. Jianzhi cuttings often have a heavy emphasis on Chinese characters symbolizing the Chinese zodiac animals.
Although paper cutting is popular around the globe, only the Chinese paper cut was listed in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists, which was in 2009. The Chinese paper-cutting was recognized and listed because it has a history of more than 1500 years and it represents cultural values of the people throughout China.
Modern paper cutting has developed into a commercial industry. Papercutting remains popular in contemporary China, especially during special events like the Chinese New Year or weddings.
Indonesian.
Indonesian traditional art influenced by China art in some part in Indonesia. Batik is an Indonesian traditional art and paper cutting can be combined perfectly; the intricate details which is batik uniqueness is the most beautiful part in Indonesia paper cutting which displayed in double glasses frame. The artist may choose only simple frame profile to expose the intricate detail of Batik.
Filipino.
Several Philippine crafts employ paper cutting. During Filipino Christmas, the "parol" (a traditional star-shaped lantern) is embellished with coloured paper cut into various forms such as floral designs on the faces, pom-pons and "tails" on the points of the star.
There is also the art of "pabalát" (wrapper), where coloured paper is meticulously cut with small scissors and used to sheathe "pastillas de leche" (carabao milk pastilles) and other traditional sweets. Paper cutting is also involved in the creation of "banderitas" (bunting) that feature prominently in "fiesta" décor; these may be elaborate or plain-cut paper squares and triangles strung over streets.
Indian.
Sanjhi is the Indian art of paper cutting. The cut paper is usually placed on the floor and colors are filled in to make Rangoli.
Jewish/Israeli.
Papercutting has been a common Jewish art form since the Middle Ages, connected with various customs and ceremonies, and associated with holidays and family life. Paper cuts often decorated "ketubot" (marriage contracts), "Mizrahs", and for ornaments on festive occasions. A story tells of Rabbi Shem-Tov ben Yitzhak ben Ardutiel, finding that his ink had frozen, continued to write the manuscript by cutting the letters into the paper. By about the 17th century, papercutting had become a popular form for small religious artifacts such as "Mizrachs" and Shavuot decorations. In the 20th century, the art of Jewish papercutting was revived in Israel. Today it is most commonly used for "mizrachs" and "ketubot".
Mexican.
Papel picado is the Mexican art of paper cutting. Tissue paper is cut into intricate designs with scissors or small, sharp chisels; this technique is frequently used to produce decorative banners.
Swedish.
Christmas is when flowers of cut and manipulated paper, fringed candy holders called crackers, and Ljuskrona which are covered with cut paper, are found in Swedish and Swedish-American homes.
Switzerland.
There is a Swiss tradition of paper-cutting, especially in the Pays-d'Enhaut.
Other.
Silhouette can refer to the art of cutting outlines or portraits out of black paper. Modern-day papercutters typically follow one or more of the "traditional" styles listed above, while others have begun to expand the art into new styles, motifs, and designs. Contemporary papercutting is also sometimes associated with the art of stenciling, itself being derived from techniques used in graffiti art. The use of hand-cut stencils in graffiti art has received international attention in recent years due in part to the artist Banksy.

Vortex (Canada's Wonderland)

Vortex is a suspended roller coaster, which enables it to swing under the track at Canada's Wonderland. It officially opened during the 1991 season. On "Vortex" riders are taken up through the top of the mountain and dropped at high speeds. At some points in the ride, the trains swing just above a river running through the middle of the park, giving riders the illusion that the train will touch the water. It is the fastest roller coaster of its kind in the world, joint with Ninja at Six Flags Magic Mountain, both with top speeds of 55 mph (89 km/h).
Similar rides.
The Bat (formerly Flight Deck and Top Gun) was built in 1993 at Wonderland's sister park Kings Island. It has a near identical layout to Vortex, but there are notable differences. They include speed and height variances and the addition of another car to each train, allowing for 28 passengers per train as opposed to 24.
Ride experience.
The train climbs the lift hill immediately after departing the loading station. The lift takes riders up and over the park's mountain centerpiece. Upon cresting the lift, the train slowly turns to the right adding to the suspense of the upcoming drop. The train then quickly dives off the side of the mountain, sweeps to the right and climbs up the "fan-turn" element of the ride that flies over guests on the midway. It then sweeps back down over the grass and above the river, swooping left and right at . The train dives into a downward helix, which swings only a few feet above the surface of the water. Upon returning to the station, the train swoops left and right a few times more until it charges into the brake run. The immense swinging force as the train enters the brake run causes the cars to swing even after the train stops moving. The ride then turns right back into the station. Vortex is also the tallest suspended coaster in the world; according to the Guinness Book Of World Records
2005 five-car train operation.
Midway through the 2005 season Vortex ran with five cars on each train as opposed to the usual six car operation. It is speculated that the first car and the last car of the trains were damaged, possibly as the result of a collision due to a blocking error. Although there is no information to confirm this, it is still considered a possibility due to the fact that the unit numbers on the trains were 6, 2, 3, 4, 5 from front to back on one train, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 on the other.
From that point until the end of the season, Vortex ran with five cars, reducing the capacity to 20 passengers per train. Although the units were removed, the wheel assembly which held the unit was still present on both trains. For the 2006 season, the missing cars were replaced. It is said that one of the cars was repaired while another was shipped from Chessington World of Adventures. The car was used on the Vampire roller coaster, which now uses floorless trains designed by Vekoma.

Vortex (California's Great America)

Vortex is a stand-up roller coaster at California's Great America. It has a different layout but is generally the same size as Vortex at Carowinds. It was Bolliger & Mabillard's second coaster after Iron Wolf at Six Flags Great America and officially opened on March 9, 1991.The coaster currently has a paint scheme of purple track with yellow rails and gray supports. 
Ride elements.
The coaster makes a left handed first drop into its first loop then executes a left turnaround. The train next travels in another left turnaround through its loop. The train then travels to the other far end of its layout into another turnaround after which it enters the corkscrew element and finally into the final brake run. The course used to cross over the park train's railroad tracks by the corkscrew. The coaster's lift hill stands parallel to the footers of the former Tidal Wave looping shuttle coaster.

Scherenschnitte

Scherenschnitte (), which means "scissor cuts" in German, is the art of papercutting design. The art work often has symmetry within the design, and common forms include silhouettes, valentines, and love letters. The art tradition was founded in Switzerland and Germany in the 16th century, and was brought to Colonial America in the 18th century by immigrants who settled primarily in Pennsylvania.

Grand Prix of Minnesota

The Grand Prix of Minnesota was an auto racing event held from 1996 until 1998 on an Alan Wilson (motorsport)-designed temporary street circuit in Minneapolis, Minnesota near the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. It was known as the Children's Grand Prix of Minneapolis in 1996, changing its name to The Sprint PCS Grand Prix of Minneapolis for its final two years. 
The Grand Prix of Minneapolis was started as the first professional auto race in the United States that would contribute all of its profit to charity. The goal of the Grand Prix was to make a $1 million annual contribution to the Cancer KIDS Fund, part of the Children's Healthcare Foundation of the Twin Cities. The event was founded by Mark and Claudia Cohn after their son Tyler (1988 – 1997) was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of 4. Rather than giving a one-time donation, the Cohn's decided to create an event that would provide long-term support for the Cancer KIDS Fund.
The event debuted on July 6 and 7 1996 with Boston Market as the sponsor. They returned for their second year on July 4 through 6 1997 with Sprint PCS as its sponsor, and they held an event on June 27 and 28 1998 with Sprint PCS continuing to be their sponsor.
All three years had the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) Trans-Am Championship as the featured race. The supporting races in 1996 included the World Challenge Grand Sports Division, Sports 2 and Touring Division, Touring 1 and 2, Spec Racer Ford Pro Series, and a Vintage Car race. The supporting races in 1997 were the Barber Dodge Pro Series, World Challenge Touring Division 1 and 2, Spec Racer Ford Pro Series, and a Vintage Car race. For their last year, the supporting races were the United States Road Racing Championship, F2000 Series, World Challenge Touring Division 1 and 2, and the Dodge Neon Charity Challenge.

Blue Lady (ghost)

The Blue Lady is the ghost of a woman reportedly seen in and around the Moss Beach Distillery Cafe in Moss Beach, California; she is so-named because she usually dressed all in blue. She is said to originate from the Prohibition era.
Background.
When the Distillery (known in its early years as "Frank's Place", after its builder and owner, Frank Torres) was first built in 1927, it was one of the main receivers of alcohol that was smuggled into California from ships that supplied liquor from Canada; following Prohibition, the San Francisco area, among other places in the United States, smuggled alcohol into the country in any way possible. As Frank's Place was located on an isolated bluff and was a classy restaurant, it was allegedly never raided by police.
The elusive ghost.
Whatever the story, the Blue Lady still reportedly frequents the Moss Beach Distillery, sometimes inside the cafe, sometimes wandering in reverie on the bluffs that overlook the sea, her clothing either bloodstained and cut, or intact and clean.
The modern accounts of The Blue Lady's presence have been shaken or disproven after episode 411 of Ghost Hunters. A speaker was found hidden in the ladies room ceiling, transmitting ghostly, pre-recorded laughter. A two-way mirror with a flashing blue head hidden behind it was also found in the ladies room; and ceiling lamps that move due to pneumatic actuators on a timer system were found in the bar. The staff at the Moss Beach Distillery Cafe failed to tell the Ghost Hunters of these staged effects.

Glifted

Glifted was an American shoegaze band formed in 2001 by Tim Lash, former guitarist for Hum, and T. J. Harrison of the band Lovecup.
They released only one album, "Under and In", on Hum's Martians Go Home label in 2002. The album was made up of experimental soundscapes, noise, loops, and beats to create an ethereal and sometimes chaotic sound that many critics compared to My Bloody Valentine, receiving generally positive reviews.
The duo recorded some material for an EP in 2005 but it was never officially released; however one track called "Blowing All Your Cool" was uploaded to their MySpace account, simply under the album title "various shenanigans". 
Although a second album was also reported to be in production, Lash confirmed in 2008 that Glifted has disbanded.

Anders Sunesen

Anders Sunesen (also "Andreas", "Suneson", "Sunesøn", Latin: "Andreas Sunonis") (c. 1167 – 1228) was a Danish archbishop of Lund, Scania, from 21 March 1201, at the death of Absalon, to his own death in 1228. He is the author of the Latin translation of the Scanian Law and was throughout his life engaged in integrating a Christian worldview into the old legislature. He managed to introduce tithe (taxation benefiting the church) despite the resistance this measure had met from the population of Scania during Absalon's time, but his efforts to convince the priests of his day about the merits of celibacy was based mostly on his own example and relied on oratory rather than legal maneuvering. To educate the priests and to forward his ideas, especially about the integration between church and state, he wrote a didactic poem, Hexaëmon, consisting of 8,040 verses of Latin hexameter. 
A nephew of Absalon and a member of the religious and political elite, Sunesen was well-traveled, having received his education in theology and philosophy in Paris, France, and his legal education in Bologna, Italy and at Oxford, England. His encounter with ideas from the European continent about Christian Crusades were incorporated into his thinking and during the early 13th century, he lobbied the Pope for a crusade against the Baltic nations. He eventually received permission to install a bishop in Reval, and in 1219, he accompanied Valdemar II in his war against Estonia. According to an old Danish myth supportive of the Danish imperial expansion, the Danish flag Dannebrog appeared in the sky and fell into the hands of Valdemar II as Sunesen raised his arms and prayed for a Danish victory during the decisive battle. 
He lived his last years in northeastern Scania, where he died in 1228 on Ivö Island in Ivö Lake, Scania's largest lake. It has been speculated that his death may have been attributed to leprosy. He is buried in a sarcophagus in Lund Cathedral.

Tatachilla Lutheran College

Tatachilla Lutheran College is a R-12 non-government school at McLaren Vale, South Australia. It was officially opened on 29 January 1995 by Rev. Garrie Fischer. From 1995 until 2001 Tatachilla was a secondary school (years 8-12), and from 2002 the primary (R-7) school was added.
The founding Principal, Mr. Bruss, has retired, effective from late June 2007. Mr Colin Minke has since taken over the position.
Sub Schools.
At the beginning of 2005 the Primary School and Secondary School sections of Tatachilla were divided into three separate sub schools. 
Many students come to Tatachilla in year 8 from surrounding Lutheran feeder schools on the Fleurieu Peninsula, so the middle school is emphasised on getting students comfortable with secondary school. During each year of middle school the students are in the same class for most subjects and have the same teacher for most subjects.
In the Senior school students start their South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE) by doing the compulsory SACE subjects in Year 10 (Stage 1 Australian Studies and Stage 1 Work Education). After Year 10 there is the option of completing SACE, Vocational Education and Training (VET) courses or a combination of both.
Facilities and Curriculum.
Performing arts.
Tatachilla has a strong emphasis on the performing arts. Students can undertake music and drama, and there are also private music lessons available. Tatachilla Lutheran College stages a musical every second year, and in the alternate year participates in the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge.
People from the school community and the wider community can become involved with the performing arts at Tatachilla. To perform the musicals people are invited from the community to perform and to become part of the chorus. From the musical that was performed in 2005 by Tatachilla, The Sound of Music, the ladies who were the chorus of Nuns' have formed a choir which meets and performs regularly. Following on from this Choir, a men's barbershop group was formed, which also meets and performs regularly. The college also hosts the McLaren Vale Community Christmas Carols each year, with the choirs from the college and other schools, a guest artist and invites musicians from all over the Fleurieu Peninsula to form an orchestra for the event. 
For the involvement of the performing arts in the wider community, Tatachilla Lutheran College won the National 2006 ABC Classic FM Flame Award, which showcases outstanding music programs in Australian Schools.
Science.
Tatachilla now has 6 science labs, after the completion of 2 new science labs in 2006. Chemistry, Biology and Physics courses are offered.
English, Geography, History and LOTE (Languages other than English).
English, Geography and History courses are offered at Tatachilla. For LOTE Japanese courses are offered.
Technology.
Tatachilla's computer network is dual platform, with the capability to run Windows and Mac based programs. A Virtual Private Network is also available, which allows students to access the school server from any home computer that has an internet connection.
There is also woodwork, metal work and electronics room with these courses being offered.
Environment.
Tatachilla has an EcoClassroom with native plant species and small animal species including Brush Tailed Bettongs, Tammar Wallabies and Long Nosed Potoroos. There have been seven distinct ecosystems mapped in the area including:
Meetings are held regularly by the Friends of the EcoClassroom group (FOEC) and the fauna is monitored. The EcoClassroom is also visited by community groups.
In 2009 a Water Retention Pond was constructed using a Government Water Grant. This water will be used to water the ovals and surrounds instead of relying on mains water.

Career.
In October 2004, Adachi joined the Watanabe Entertainment group named the D-BOYS. He took part in TV shows and has appeared in Glay's "White Road" (2005) music video. He was also a part of the Watanabe net drama "Hice Cool" (2005) and "DD-BOYS", appearing alongside fellow D-Boys members. But, by the end of January 2007, it was announced to fan club members that while Adachi was still being represented by Watanabe Pro, both he and Yuma Minakawa had officially withdrawn from the group. In April 2008, however, it was announced that Adachi would be re-joining the D-BOYS and participating in the second D-Stage. The reason given for his former withdrawal was that he had been studying acting at a university, and also that he had been feeling self-conscious about his abilities.
As Eiji Kikumaru in The Prince of Tennis Musicals.
In 2004, Adachi won the role of Eiji Kikumaru, the acrobatic player of Seigaku Middle School's tennis club, in the "Prince of Tennis" musicals, Tenimyu. From 2005 to 2006, he became the third actor to play Kikumaru as a member of the second generation Seigaku cast. He made his debut as Kikumaru on January 8, 2005 in the "Side Yamabuki" performance in Osaka. That same year, his role as Kikumaru was carried into the live adaptation film of the manga. During his run in the musicals, he was able to work with fellow D-BOYS members Yuya Endo, Kotaro Yanagi, Masaki Kaji, Hiroki Suzuki, Hirofumi Araki, Masato Wada, and former member Yuu Shirota. 
On March 29, 2006, in the "Dream Live 3rd" live concert, Adachi, along with the majority of the Seigaku cast, graduated from their roles. Since his graduation, the role of Kikumaru has been played by D-BOYS member Kōji Seto, Kyousuke Hamao, Shouta Takazaki, Yuta Koseki and currently by Kuroba Mario.
As Eiji Kikumaru in The Prince of Tennis live-action film.
Adachi was able to carry on his role from the musicals to the live-adaptation film of the manga series of "The Prince of Tennis". He, along with most of the principal cast members for the Seigaku Regulars, were able to reprise their roles in the movie. The only major casting change was the casting of Kanata Hongo as Ryoma Echizen, the main protagonist. 
"The Prince of Tennis" was released on May 13, 2006 and opened on the tenth spot in the Japanese Box Office and marked Adachi's first appearance in the film industry.

Tony Stigsson

Stig Kent Tony Stigsson (born November 6, 1956, in Lönsboda, a part of Osby in Skåne in Sweden) is a former major general in the Swedish Army, former operative head for the staff of the Swedish armed forces, as well as member of the Swedish army staff and Sweden's representative in the Challenges of Peace Operations. Until 2005, Stigsson was also president of the Swedish wrestling federation.
Tony Stigsson was arrested in early 2005 on suspicion of rape, spousal abuse and mishandling of top secret classified documents. He was convicted of spousal abuse on July 6, 2005 and sentenced to 6 months of prison for two counts of assault, which was later reduced to three months on appeal.
Stigsson has since been relieved of all duties at the armed forces, and the government disciplinary board (Statens ansvarsnämnd) is currently reviewing whether Stigsson is to be dismissed from the Swedish armed forces. While the above were the main charges, an incriminating factor in the case from the start has been Stigsson's interest in sado-masochistic sex practices which, together with his careless handling of secret documents, were considered a clear security risk by investigators. Most of the investigation relating to this has been classified.
Security risk.
According to the TV4 "Kalla Fakta" documentary, Major General Stigsson took serious security risks long before he was arrested last year for assaulting his wife. When searched by police, he was found to be in possession of very explicit pornographic material, which, it is alleged, made him vulnerable to blackmail. The TV4 investigation contends that a combination of the senior officer's sexual behaviour and his handling of extremely sensitive military documents constituted a major national security risk.
When Stigsson was arrested in March 2005, police found explicit, and very deviant, pornographic material in the Major General's uniform pockets as well as in his places of residence. The risk of blackmail was further increased by the fact that Stigsson made contact with unknown persons on the internet, with the intention of meeting them for group sex at swingers' clubs. According to TV4, whose reporters have had access to the full police investigation, the major general was aware of the risks. In an e-mail sent to a woman from his work address, he writes that he wanted to "test the limits", knowing that he was "always running the risk of finding myself in a blackmail situation".
In June 2006, chief prosecutor Ulf Forsberg in Uppsala decided not to press charges with Stigsson over negligence with regard to secret documents, a crime that is considered a threat to national security. Police found 300 documents in Stigsson's home, out of which 70 were classified, but Forsberg was not able to prove that any of the information contained in the documents had been disclosed to a third party.
Among the copied documents found scattered around various locations in Stigsson's house were some of the most secret and sensitive in the military's possession. These included, for instance, notes and plans of secret mountain hideouts from which Sweden would be governed in wartime, as well as documents concerning the outcome of successful intelligence operations.
Supreme Commander Håkan Syrén has requested Stigsson's dismissal. In May 2008, the National Disciplinary Offence Board reached the same decision; Stigsson has appealed it. Since 2005 he has had no active involvement with the military. Syrén, previously head of Sweden's military intelligence services, also pointed out that the defence forces have recently introduced more rigorous background checks for those seeking high-level military posts.

Fretboard Journal

The Fretboard Journal is a keepsake magazine for guitar, mandolin, and stringed instrument players. In the same vein of other "coffee table magazines" such as "Gastronomica", "The Surfer's Journal", and the "Rodder's Journal", it boasts high-end production values, lengthy interviews and exclusive photography in each issue. Each issue is filled with photos of rare instruments, well-known musicians, and even the workshops of instrument builders. The magazine is also available on the iPad. 
The "Fretboard Journal" was founded by Michael Simmons, a veteran of musical instrument retail sales, and Jason Verlinde, a longtime music journalist. It is published out of Seattle, Washington. Years before, they collaborated on the "Ukulele Occasional" magazine, a small zine devoted to the four string instrument. 
The first issue of the "Fretboard Journal" was unveiled in November 2005. Stories included an interview with mandolinist David Grisman, an interview with Charlie Louvin by Neko Case, and a profile of Santa Cruz Guitar Company. The second issue featured Case on the cover discussing tenor guitars, an article about Martin Guitars', history and an interview with mandolinist Andy Statman. Issues now come out every three months.
In 2006, the magazine was the only publication listed in the "Washington Post"'s annual Best of 2006: Music section. It was also profiled in the July 2009 issue of "Seattle magazine". 
The magazine is known for its long-form journalism and in-depth interviews, often several thousand words long, covering a wide array of musician subjects and styles. It also often frequently asks well known musicians to interview their musical heroes. In addition to Case interviewing Louvin, the magazine has had Ben Harper interview David Lindley for the Fall 2008 issue; Bill Frisell interview Jim Hall for the Winter 2008 issue and Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth interview Michael Chapman for the Winter 2009 issue.
More recently, the magazine has expanded to producing high-definition videos of many of its subjects, including Jackson Browne, David Crosby and many other artists and builders. They also have a weekly podcast featuring many of the magazine's subjects and artists. 
In 2012, the magazine celebrated its seventh anniversary with a party for its subscribers and contributors in Seattle's Fremont neighborhood. Performers at the party included Bill Frisell, Reignwolf, Eric Skye and many others. The magazine posted photos from the event on its website here.

The Computer Security Law of 1987, Public Law No. 100-235 (H.R. 145), (Jan. 8, 1988), was passed by the United States Congress. It was passed to improve the security and privacy of sensitive information in federal computer systems and to establish a minimum acceptable security practices for such systems. It requires the creation of computer security plans, and the appropriate training of system users or owners where the systems house sensitive information.
History.
It was repealed by the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 SEC. 305. (a)

Lars Grael

Lars Schmidt Grael (born February 9, 1964 in São Paulo) is a former sailor and Brazilian politician. His brother, Torben Grael, is also a sailor.
Grael is the winner of two Olympic medals, one in the 1988 Summer Olympics, the other in the 1996 Summer Olympics. He was world champion in 1983 for the Snipe class and ten time Brazilian and five time South American champion for the Tornado class.
In September 1998, he suffered a serious accident in Vitória, Espírito Santo, caused by the negligence of an irresponsible boat driver that left the boat propeller uncovered, which amputated one of the athlete's legs. Grael then gradually began to take a role to promote the sport in politics.

Genesis I

Genesis I is an experimental space habitat designed and built by the private American firm Bigelow Aerospace and launched in 2006. It was the first module to be sent into orbit by the company, and is testing various systems, materials and techniques related to determining the viability of long-term inflatable space structures. Such structures, including this module and others built by Bigelow Aerospace, are based on the NASA TransHab design, which provides increased interior volume at a reduced launch diameter and potentially reduced mass compared to traditional rigid structures.
Spacecraft history.
"Genesis I" was launched on 12 July 2006 at 14:53:30 UTC aboard an ISC Kosmotras Dnepr rocket, launched from Dombarovskiy missile base near Yasniy, Russia. Spacecraft control was transferred to Bigelow Aerospace at 15:08 UTC after a successful orbital insertion. Designed as a one-third scale model of the full size "BA 330", when in orbit the main body of the craft measures long and in diameter, with an interior habitable volume of . As part of the expandable design, however, the module launched with a diameter of only , inflating to its full size after entering orbit. The expansion process took approximately ten minutes.
"Genesis I" suffered a major radiation event in December 2006 as a result of a "solar storm". Mission controllers were able to restart the system in time, though the situation was described as being "one fault away from the spacecraft being dead." Despite this, no lasting damage appears to have occurred and the spacecraft was operating in "excellent shape" .
The spacecraft completed its 10,000th orbit on 8 May 2008, some 660 days after launch. By that time, "Genesis I" had traveled more than 430 million kilometers (270 million miles), the equivalent of going to the Moon and back 1,154 times, and had taken more than 14,000 images, including images of all seven continents. Its electrical equipment had been continuously powered since it first became operational.
Although the design life of the spacecraft avionics was only six months, the avionics systems worked flawlessly for "over two and a half years" before failure. The data received after the first six months was a re-verification of the validation test suite that was accomplished during the design life period.
In February 2011, Bigelow reported that the vehicle had "performed flawlessly in terms of pressure maintenance and thermal control-environmental containment."
The orbital life is estimated to be 12 years, with a gradually decaying orbit resulting in re-entry into Earth's atmosphere and burn-up expected. , the vehicle remains in orbit.
Systems.
"Genesis I" is outfitted with eight GaAs solar panel arrays, four on each end of the craft, which produce one kilowatt total power and maintain a 26 volt battery charge. It carries thirteen cameras, seven externally to monitor the physical condition of the spacecraft, such as the outer shell and solar arrays, and six internally to photograph the various objects and experiments. Internal systems established an atmospheric pressure of and use passive thermal control to keep temperatures at an average of , with observed limits of approximately and . "Genesis I" uses a single gas tank for its inflation system, and guidance/stabilization control is performed using a network of torque rods, sun sensors, GPS and a magnetometer.
Payload.
Aside from the various systems and monitoring equipment, "Genesis I" is orbiting with a wide variety of cargo. Bigelow employees contributed numerous photographs, toys, cards and other items, which can be seen in still images floating around the cabin. Bigelow also placed a life-sciences experiment on board, which contains four Madagascar hissing cockroaches ("Gromphadorhina portentosa") and approximately 20 so-called Mexican jumping beans, which are seeds containing the live larva of the moth "Cydia deshaisiana". In addition, the company allowed NASA to include a prototype for the GeneSat series of nanosatellites. This device, called GeneBox, tested the systems and procedures that will be used on future GeneSat missions. While GeneBox carries no living organisms, future flights will use sensors and optics to measure how weightlessness affects genes and the genetic activity of cells and microscopic life.

Alun Evans (cricketer)

Alun Evans (born August 20, 1975) is a Welsh cricketer. He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler. He has played first-class cricket since 1996, when his stroke-playing ability and free scoring captured the eye of spectators. He spent a short period of time with Middlesex's Second XI, but when he hit three centuries in a mere month with the side, he was recommended to step up to first-class cricket, where he made his debut with 66 not out in 1996.
Despite only playing one first-class match during 1997, he became a heavy scorer in the Second XI, at which point the retirement of Hugh Morris allowed the young Welshman to take his place as a regular opening batsman. This was until a stress fracture stopped him from performing in the 1998 season, meaning Evans was unable to return until the opening day of 1999, the same year in which he hit his maiden One-day century.
Matthew Elliott and Jimmy Maher were soon to join the team from Melbourne and Queensland, and Evans was later released from the club. Most recently, Evans re-emerged for the 2001-03 Second XI championships, several Minor Counties matches, most recently in the 2006 MCCA Trophy, and in the 2005/06 State Shield, contested between New Zealand-based teams.
Evans was the Glamorgan CCC Young Cricketer of the Year in 1996. He currently plays for and captains Ammanford Cricket Club.
