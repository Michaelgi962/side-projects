History of the potato

The potato was first domesticated in the region of modern-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia between 8000 and 5000 BCE. It has since spread around the world and become a staple crop in many countries.
History by region.
South America.
In the Altiplano, potatoes provided the principal energy source for the Inca Empire, its predecessors, and its Spanish successor. In Bolivia and Peru above 10,000 feet altitude, tubers exposed to the cold night air turned into chuño; when kept in permanently frozen underground storehouses, chuño can be stored for years with no loss of nutritional value. The Spanish fed chuño to the silver miners who produced vast wealth in the 16th century for the Spanish government.
Potato was the staple food of most Pre–Columbian Mapuches, "specially in the southern and coastal territories where maize did not reach maturity".
Europe.
Sailors returning from the Andes to Spain with silver presumably brought maize and potatoes for their own food on the trip. Historians speculate that leftover tubers (and maize) were carried ashore and planted: "We think that the potato arrived some years before the end of the 16th century, by two different ports of entry: the first, logically, in Spain around 1570, and the second via the British isles between 1588 and 1593 ... we find traces of the transport of potatoes travelling from the Canaries to Antwerp in 1567 ... we can say that the potato was introduced there Canary islands from South America around 1562 ... the first written mention of the potato ... a receipt for delivery dated 28 november 1567 between Las Palmas in the Grand Canaries and Antwerp." Basque fishermen from Spain used potatoes as ships' stores for their voyages across the Atlantic in the 16th century, and introduced the tuber to western Ireland, where they landed to dry their cod. In 1553, in the book "Crónica del Peru", Pedro Cieza de Leon mentions he saw it in Quito, Popayán, and Pasto in 1538. The English privateer Sir Francis Drake, returning from his circumnavigation, or Sir Walter Raleigh's employee Thomas Harriot are commonly credited with introducing potatoes into England. In 1588, botanist Carolus Clusius made a painting of what he called "Papas Peruanorum" from a specimen in the Low Countries; in 1601 he reported that potatoes were in common use in northern Italy for animal fodder and for human consumption. 
The Spanish had an empire across Europe, and brought potatoes for their armies. Peasants along the way adopted the crop, which was less often pillaged by marauding armies than above-ground stores of grain. Across most of northern Europe, where open fields prevailed, potatoes were strictly confined to small garden plots because field agriculture was strictly governed by custom that prescribed seasonal rhythms for plowing, sowing, harvesting and grazing animals on fallow and stubble. This meant that potatoes were barred from large-scale cultivation because the rules allowed only grain to be planted in the open fields. In France and Germany government officials and noble landowners promoted the rapid conversion of fallow land into potato fields after 1750. The potato thus became an important staple crop in northern Europe. Famines in the early 1770s contributed to its acceptance, as did government policies in several European countries and climate change during the Little Ice Age, when traditional crops in this region did not produce as reliably as before. At times and places when and where most other crops failed, potatoes could still typically be relied upon to contribute adequately to food supplies during colder years.
In France, at the end of the 16th century, the potato had been introduced to the Franche-Comté, the Vosges of Lorraine and Alsace. By the end of the 18th century it was written in the 1785 edition of "Bon Jardinier": "There is no vegetable about which so much has been written and so much enthusiasm has been shown ... The poor should be quite content with this foodstuff." It had widely replaced the turnip and rutabaga by the 19th century.
French physician Antoine Parmentier studied the potato intensely and in "Examen chymique des pommes de terres" (Paris, 1774) showed their enormous nutritional value. King Louis XVI and his court eagerly promoted the new crop, with Queen Marie Antoinette even wearing a headdress of potato flowers at a fancy dress ball. The annual potato crop of France soared to 21 million hectoliters in 1815 and 117 million in 1840, allowing a concomitant growth in population while avoiding the Malthusian trap. Although potatoes had become widely familiar in Russia by 1800, they were confined to garden plots until the grain failure in 1838–1839 persuaded peasants and landlords in central and northern Russia to devote their fallow fields to raising potatoes. Potatoes yielded from two to four times more calories per acre than grain did, and eventually came to dominate the food supply in eastern Europe. Boiled or baked potatoes were cheaper than rye bread, just as nutritious, and did not require a gristmill for grinding. On the other hand cash-oriented landlords realized that grain was much easier to ship, store and sell, so both grain and potatoes coexisted.
Throughout Europe, the most important new food in the 19th century was the potato, which had three major advantages over other foods for the consumer: its lower rate of spoilage, its bulk (which easily satisfied hunger), and its cheapness. The crop slowly spread across Europe, such that, for example, by 1845 it occupied one-third of Irish arable land. Potatoes comprised about 10% of the caloric intake of Europeans. Along with several other foods that either originated in the Americas or were successfully grown or harvested there, potatoes sustained European populations.
In Britain, the potato promoted economic development by underpinning the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century. It served as a cheap source of calories and nutrients that was easy for urban workers to cultivate on small backyard plots. Potatoes became popular in the north of England, where coal was readily available, so a potato-driven population boom provided ample workers for the new factories. Marxist Friedrich Engels even declared that the potato was the equal of iron for its "historically revolutionary role". The Dutch potato-starch industry grew rapidly in the 19th century, especially under the leadership of entrepreneur Willem Albert Scholten (1819–92).
In Ireland, the expansion of potato cultivation was due entirely to the landless laborers, renting tiny plots from landowners who were interested only in raising cattle or in producing grain for market. A single acre of potatoes and the milk of a single cow was enough to feed a whole Irish family a monotonous but nutritionally adequate diet for a healthy, vigorous (and desperately poor) rural population. Often even poor families grew enough extra potatoes to feed a pig that they could sell for cash.
A lack of genetic diversity from the low number of varieties left the crop vulnerable to disease. In 1845, a plant disease known as late blight (so-called because it tended to spread exponentially in late summer), caused by the fungus-like oomycete "Phytophthora infestans", spread rapidly through the poorer communities of western Ireland, resulting in the crop failures that led to the Great Irish Famine.
The Lumper potato, widely cultivated in western and southern Ireland before and during the great famine, was bland, wet, and poorly resistant to the potato blight, but yielded large crops and usually provided adequate calories for peasants and laborers. Heavy dependence on this potato led to disaster when the blight quickly turned harvest-ready and newly harvested potatoes into a putrid mush. The Irish Famine in the western and southern parts of Ireland between 1845–49 was a catastrophic failure in the food supply that led to approximately a million deaths from famine and (especially) diseases that attacked weakened bodies, and to massive emigration to Britain, the U.S., Canada and elsewhere. During the famine years roughly one million Irish immigrated, this tide was not turned until the 20th century, when Ireland's population stood at less than half of the pre-famine level of 8 million.
Africa.
It is generally believed that potatoes entered Africa with colonists, who consumed them as a vegetable rather than as a staple starch. Shipping records from 1567 show that the first place outside of Central and South America where potatoes were grown were the Canary Islands. As in other continents, despite its advantages as an anti-famine, high-elevation alternative to grain, potatoes were first resisted by local farmers who believed they were poisonous. Colonialists also promoted them as a low cost food and so it was a symbol of domination. In former European colonies of Africa, potatoes were initially consumed only occasionally, but increased production made them a staple in certain areas. Potatoes tended to become more popular in wartime due to their being able to be stored in the ground. In present day Africa they have become a vegetable or co-staple crop.
In higher regions of Rwanda, potatoes have become a new staple food crop. Prior to the 1994 Rwandan genocide consumption was as high as 153 to 200 kg per year – higher than in any Western European country. Recently farmers have developed the potato as a cash crop after introducing several new varieties brought back by migrant laborers from Uganda and other varieties from Kenya.
Asia.
The potato diffused widely after 1600, becoming a major food resource in Europe and East Asia. Following its introduction into China toward the end of the Ming dynasty, the potato immediately became a delicacy of the imperial family. After the middle period of the Qianlong reign (1735–96), population increases and a subsequent need to increase grain yields coupled with greater peasant geographic mobility led to the rapid spread of potato cultivation throughout China, and it was acclimated to local natural conditions.
Boomgaard (2003) looks at the adoption of various root and tuber crops in Indonesia throughout the colonial period and examines the chronology and reasons for progressive adoption of foreign crops: sweet potato, Irish potato, bengkuang (yam beans), and cassava.
The potato was introduced in the Philippines during the late 16th century, and to Java and China during the 17th century. It was well established as a crop in India by the late 18th century and in Africa by the mid-20th century.
North America.
Potatoes were planted in Idaho as early as 1838; by 1900 the state's production exceeded a million bushels (about 27,000 tonnes). Prior to 1910, the crops were stored in barns or root cellars, but, by the 1920s, potato cellars or barns came into use. U.S. potato production has increased steadily; two-thirds of the crop comes from Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, and Maine, and potato growers have strengthened their position in both domestic and foreign markets.
By the 1960s, the Canadian Potato Research Centre in Fredericton, New Brunswick, was one of the top six potato research institutes in the world. Established in 1912 as a dominion experimental station, the station began in the 1930s to concentrate on breeding new varieties of disease-resistant potatoes. In the 1950s–1960s, the growth of the French fry industry in New Brunswick led to a focus on developing varieties for the industry. By the 1970s, the station's potato research was broader than ever before, but the station and its research programs had changed, as emphasis was placed on serving industry rather than potato farmers in general. Scientists at the station even began describing their work using engineering language rather than scientific prose. Potatoes are Canada's most important vegetable crop; they are grown commercially in all its provinces, led by Prince Edward Island.
In modern days potatoes have grown in popularity due to their versatility and ability to be used for many different dishes of food.

Egypt Independent

Egypt Independent is an Egyptian newspaper that publishes a website and formerly published a weekly 24-page English-language newspaper that had evolved from the English edition of Al-Masry Al-Youm.
History.
On 24 November 2011, the first edition of "Egypt Independent" was published. It had evolved from the English edition of "Al-Masry Al-Youm", which was previously published as a weekly supplement to the newspaper. 
After being banned to publish their second edition by the chief editor of "Al-Masry Al-Youm", "Egypt Independent" acquired its own license and resumed publishing its weekly edition independent from "Al-Masry Al-Youm" in 2012.
In April 2013, the management of Al-Masry Media Corporation informed the "Egypt Independent" editorial team that the print and online news operation is being shut down, though the website continues to publish new stories, which are translations of articles published in "Al-Masry Al-Youm".
In June 2013, some former employees of "Egypt Independent" began publishing "Mada Masr".
Accusations of internal censorship.
On 1 December 2011, the chief editor of "Al-Masry Al-Youm" objected to and ultimately censored a print issue of "Egypt Independent".
The second issue of "Egypt Independent" was to carry an opinion piece by Robert Springborg, a political scientist and expert on Egyptian civil-military relations, that was critical of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces that had ruled Egypt since the February 2011 departure of former president Housni Mubarak. Springborg and the "Egypt Independent" staff collaborated to alter the offending sections in the opinion piece, however the second issue of the supplement was nevertheless prevented from being published. Professor Springborg was himself accused of being a "conspirator against Egypt's stability" in the 7 December 2011 Arabic-language edition of "Al-Masry Al-Youm".
The self-censorship episode prompted the staff of "Egypt Independent" to write that "even after 25 January, self-censorship still plagues Egyptian media. As an Egyptian newspaper, we, too, suffer from it. But if self-censorship becomes internalized and goes unquestioned, it becomes an irreversible practice. We refuse to let this happen."

<doc id="36801934" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36801934" title="Operation Mardonius">
Operation Mardonius

Operation Mardonius was a military operation directed against German ships in occupied Norway, planned and carried out in 1943 by the British Special Operations Executive (SOE). The outcome of the operation was sinking of two ships in the harbour of Oslo, of Hamburg and .
Preparations.
While training with the Norwegian Independent Company 1 in England and Scotland, Max Manus and Joachim Rønneberg developed the initial draft for naval sabotage based on small magnetic limpet mines with time delay, delivered to the ship from kayaks, and using a long iron stick to place the limpet on the ship's side. They did not get any immediate response to the plan. Later, Manus developed a revised plan along with Gregers Gram, this time much more detailed. The plans were eventually approved, and they started the preparations, doing experiments and training. The two SOE agents Max Manus and Gregers Gram were sent to Norway and parachuted into Østmarka east of Oslo on 12 March 1943. They landed near the lake Øyeren, just south of Tonevann, along with several containers with weapons and provisions. Their primary mission was sabotage operation directed against German ships in the Oslofjord.
Sabotage and sinking.
The sabotage took place on the evening of 27 April 1943. In addition to Manus and Gram, two local resistance people, Einar Riis and Halvor Haddeland, also took part in the operation. They were thus four men in two canoes, and first paddled to the island Bleikøya, where they earlier had deposited equipment for the operation. They waited on Bleikøya until darkness, but weather conditions were not ideal because of starlight when the cloud cover disappeared. Gram and Haddeland headed with their canoe for the ship "Ortelsburg" of Hamburg, where they placed four limpet mines with time delay, and they also placed limpets on a second ship, . Manus and Riis paddled towards Grønlia, where they placed limpets on the ship "Tugela". Another target ship, , was abandoned because the area was lit due to ongoing night work.
Next day, on 28 April, the mines on "Ortelsburg" exploded, and the ship sank within minutes. A charge left on Bleikøya also detonated, as did a mine attached to an oil lighter. Then the charge on "Tugela" exploded, while charges on "Sarpfoss" did not detonate. A coordinated attempt to simultaneously destroy ships at the shipyard Akers Mekaniske Verksted did not succeed.
Aftermath.
After the sabotage operation, Manus and Gram departed to Stockholm and continued to England. In June 1943 they were decorated with the (Norwegian) War Cross with Sword, awarded by King Haakon at a ceremony in Nethy Bridge in Scotland. Manus and Gram returned to Norway in October 1943, taking part in the SOE Operation Bundle. Gram was killed during a fight with the Gestapo in November 1944, while Manus survived the war and died in 1996, 81 years old.
Operation Mardonius was featured in the 2008 film "", produced by John M. Jacobsen. The film's description of Mardonius deviates somewhat from the actual course of events, due to dramaturgic motives. Aksel Hennie played the role of Max Manus, while Nicolai Cleve Broch portrayed Gregers Gram. Haddeland and Riis were not featured as characters in the film; they were replaced with the characters "Edvard Tallaksen" (played by Mats Eldøen) and "Lars Emil Erichsen" (played by Jacob Oftebro).

Avraham Kalmanowitz

Avraham Kalmanowitz (1891 – 15 February 1964) was an Orthodox rabbi and rosh yeshiva of the Mir yeshiva in Brooklyn, New York from 1946 to 1964. Born in Belarus, he served as Rav of several Eastern European Jewish communities and escaped to the United States in 1940 following the German occupation of Poland. In the U.S. he became a tireless rescue activist on behalf of the millions of Jews trapped in Nazi Europe and in the Soviet Union. He is credited with the successful transfer of the entire Mir yeshiva from Lithuania to Shanghai, providing for its support for five years, and obtaining visas and travel fare to bring all 250 students and faculty to America after World War II. He established the U.S. branch of the Mir in 1946. In the 1950s he aided North African and Syrian Jewish youth suffering from persecution and pogroms, and successfully lobbied for the passage of a bill granting "endangered refugee status" to Jewish emigrants from Arab lands.
Early life and education.
He was born in the town of Delyatitz, Minsk province, Belarus, to Rabbi Aharon Aryeh Leib and Maita Kalmanowitz. His father was a Talmid Chacham and Rav of several European Jewish communities. His father exerted a major influence on his education. He studied at the yeshiva in Zweil, Lithuania, and at age 16 entered the Eishishok yeshiva headed by Rabbi Zundel Hutner. At age 18 he progressed to the Slabodka yeshiva, where the Alter of Slabodka, Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel, arranged for him to learn in "chavrusa" with his own son, Rabbi Moshe Finkel. Kalmanowitz received rabbinic ordination from Rabbi Moshe Mordechai Epstein of Slabodka, Rabbi Raphael Shapiro of Volozhin, Rabbi Eliezer Rabinowitz of Minsk, and Rabbi Eliyahu Baruch Kamai of the Mir.
Entering the rabbinate.
In 1913 he married the granddaughter of Rabbi Betzalel Hakohen, a dayan (rabbinical court judge) in Vilna and author of the Talmudic commentary "Mareh Kohen", which appears in all printed editions of the Talmud. His wife's other grandfather, Rabbi Avraham Moshe, was a former Rav of the town of Rakov on the Polish-Russian border; that community asked Kalmanowitz to serve as its Rav in 1913. In 1916 Kalmanowitz founded a Talmud Torah in Rakov and, in 1918, a yeshiva.
Kalmanowitz became a central rabbinic figure and communal leader, working on behalf of refugees and Jews in difficult straits. In 1914, when Rakov was flooded with thousands of refugees fleeing Russia with the outbreak of World War I, Kalmanowitz founded a rescue organization that furnished food and clothing. During the Bolshevik Revolution, he aided Jews arrested by the Bolsheviks and was subsequently arrested and imprisoned in Minsk. Later he assisted Rabbi Grodzinski in the running of the latter's Vaad Hayeshivos, which provided financial aid and support to European yeshivas and their students. In 1928 Kalmanowitz helped Grodzinski found a kollel in Vilna called Ateret Zvi, and served as rosh kollel (dean) for its first year of operation. Afterwards he helped move it to Otvosk, where it operated until 1934.
In 1926 Kalmanowitz was elected honorary president of the Mir yeshiva and began fund-raising for this institution in the United States. During the 1930s he applied for and received U.S. citizenship and a passport.
In 1929 he accepted the position of Rav and "av beis din" (head of the rabbinical court) of Tykocin (Tiktin), and established a yeshiva in that town. He was also a member of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah (Council of Torah Sages) of the World Agudath Israel. He was forced to flee Tiktin for Bialystok after stopping a pogrom planned by local anti-Semitic elements, who slandered him to the local authorities.
Holocaust activism.
With the outbreak of World War II, Kalmanowitz fled to Vilna along with thousands of other rabbis and yeshiva students. With the blessing of Rabbi Grodzinski, he used his U.S. passport to travel to New York via Sweden, arriving in April 1940. He immediately plunged into rescue work on behalf of the rabbis, rosh yeshivas, and yeshiva students still in Europe, calling on rabbinical and political contacts which he had established previously. In the winter of 1940 Kalmanowitz joined the Vaad Hatzalah (Rescue Committee) headed by Rabbi Eliezer Silver, and became a key figure in that organization. He was known as a tireless agent for rescue, bombarding government officials with letters and telegrams pleading for help for all Jews trapped in Nazi Europe as well as for those stranded in the Soviet Union. Even before the U.S. government approved the legality of sending "free currency" ("i.e.", Swiss francs) into enemy-occupied territory for the purpose of supporting penniless refugees, Kalmanowitz sent money overseas, "ignoring illegalities and FBI threats of arrest".
Kalmanowitz openly desecrated the Shabbat on several occasions in the name of "pikuach nefesh" (the Jewish principle of saving lives) by fund-raising in synagogues, filling out forms, and riding in taxis to government and institutional offices on Shabbat to obtain approvals and funds. The tall, regal-looking rabbi often broke down in tears and even fainted from emotion in front of government officials as he pleaded his cause. He successfully gained the support of U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr. after crying uncontrollably in Morgenthau's office; Morgenthau helped him gain access to State Department officials. As Joseph J. Schwartz, chairman of the Joint's European Executive Council, told an interviewer, "There was a rabbi with a long white beard, who, when he cried, even the State Department listened". Kalmanowitz was one of the 350 rabbis who participated in the 1943 Rabbis March on Washington.
Saving the Mir yeshiva.
Kalmanowitz is credited with securing the funds and papers to transfer the entire Mir yeshiva – consisting of 250 students, faculty members, and the yeshiva's entire library of "sefarim" – to Kobe, Japan in 1941 and from there to Shanghai, and providing for its upkeep for five years. Thanks to the money Kalmanowitz sent, Mir students were able to board with Jewish families and eat a nourishing Shabbat meal most of the time – privileges that other refugee students in Shanghai did not enjoy. In addition to money, Kalmanowitz sent matzos and wine for Passover, and hundreds of copies of Talmudic tractates so the students could continue studying without interruption. After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 and the U.S. declared war on Japan, the Joint was prohibited from sending money to the yeshiva students in Shanghai. But Kalmanowitz established new contacts and influenced U.S. government officials to tacitly approve the sending of funds from the U.S. to Japan via neutral Switzerland. At war's end, Kalmanowitz obtained visas and travel fare to bring all the Mir students and faculty by ship to San Francisco and by train to New York; the last Mir refugee left Shanghai in 1948.
In 1946 Kalmanowitz established a new branch of the Mir yeshiva in New York City. The yeshiva was first established in temporary quarters in Far Rockaway and Brownsville, and then in a permanent home in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, where it thrives to this day.
Rescue work in North Africa.
In the late 1940s and 1950s, Kalmanowitz inundated government, United Nations, and church officials with appeals to stop persecutions and pogroms against Jews in Egypt and Syria that eventually resulted in the dissolution of those communities. His efforts led to the passage of a bill according "endangered refugee status" to Jews in Arab lands, paving the way for their immigration to the United States.
Kalmanowitz worked onsite to strengthen traditional Torah education among North African Jewish youth. Together with the leaders of Jewish communities in Morocco and Tunisia, he helped found the Otzar HaTorah educational network, which established 28 yeshivas and 20 Talmud Torahs, as well as girls schools, in those countries in 1947 and 1948. Kalmanowitz also devised and pushed through a plan granting student visas to the Mir yeshiva in Brooklyn for North African Jewish teens and opened special sections in the yeshiva for them, even though the yeshiva's financial situation was dire. A group of 13 boys arrived from Morocco in 1948, but most left the yeshivah to find jobs. One of those who remained was Avraham Portal, a native of Marrakech, who returned to Morocco in 1953 so he could apply for permanent residency status in the United States and in the meantime became the educational supervisor for the Otzar HaTorah network in the French region of Morocco. Portal returned to the Mir in 1956 with a hand-picked group of 15 boys and taught them in a separate program that became the Mir's first high school class. Another beneficiary of Kalmanowitz's largesse was Rabbi David Rebibo, a Moroccan-born student in France who used the student visa Kalmanowitz sent him to come study at the Mir in 1953. Afterwards Kalmanowitz helped Rebibo find his first teaching job. Rebibo has been dean of the Phoenix Hebrew Academy and senior rabbi of Beth Jacob Congregation in Phoenix, Arizona since 1965.
Death and legacy.
During a fund-raising trip to Florida in 1964, Kalmanowitz suffered a heart attack and died in Miami Beach on 15 February 1964 (2 Adar 5724) at the age of 73. He was eulogized in large funerals in front of the Mir yeshivas in New York and Jerusalem, and afterwards buried in the Sanhedria Cemetery in Jerusalem next to his father.
His eldest son, Rabbi Shraga Moshe Kalmanowitz, and his son-in-law, Rabbi Shmuel Berenbaum, succeeded him as roshei yeshiva of the Mir yeshiva in Brooklyn.

2012–13 Tana River District clashes

In August 2012, a series of ethnic clashes between the Orma and Pokomo tribes of Kenya's Tana River District resulted in the deaths of at least fifty-two people. The violence was the worst of its kind in Kenya since the country's 2007–08 crisis.The violence left 118 people dead and more than 13,500 displaced and another more than 30,000 people affected by the ethno-political clashes. Over 50% of the 13500 are children the rest being women and elderly.
Background.
The major ethnic groups of the Tana River District are the Pokomo, many of whom are farmers along the Tana River, and the Orma, who are predominantly a cattle-herding nomadic people. The district is generally dry and prone to drought, with erratic rainfall during the March–May and October–December rainy seasons. The climate has sparked numerous clashes between farmers and nomadic peoples over access to water.
Approximately ten days before the ethnic clash on 22 August 2012, three Pokomo people were killed by members of the Orma community. In retaliation, the Pokomo people raided Orma villages and burned more than one hundred houses.
2012.
22 August incident.
On 22 August 2012, in the worst violent incident in Kenya since 2007, at least fifty-two people were killed in ethnic violence in the Tana River District between the Orma and Pokomo groups. The violence occurred in southeast Kenya, in the Reketa area of Tarassa, near the coast and approximately from the capital, Nairobi.
The ethnic violence was the result of a dispute over land rights for the tribes' chickens. Police believe that the attack was carried out by the Pokomo people, who attacked the Orma, following an Orma invasion of farms belonging to the Pokomo.
The attackers were armed with machetes, bows and arrows, spears and handguns. Thirty-one women, eleven children, and six men were killed during the violence. Of these, thirty-four people were hacked to death with machetes, while fourteen people were burned to death. Four other Kenyans later died from injuries sustained during the attack. In addition, the Pokomo captured approximately two hundred cattle belonging to the Orma.
September Incident.
On 7th Sept at 3am in the morning of 12 people were killed by Orma. The Capital FM quoted incident as: "Police and the Kenya Red Cross said the attacks occurred at Tarasaa where houses were burnt, in what is believed to be retaliatory attacks by the Orma people against the Pokomos."
Kenya Red Cross state that over 300 cattle and 400 goat have been raided,house torched. 
On 10th Sept 38 people were killed by Pokomo, including 9 police officer. The deceased include 16 men, five women, nine police officers and eight children. The officers include five GSU, two Administration Police and two regular police officers. The violence occurred at Kilelengwani Village 
On the next morning of 11th, 3 people were killed by Orma at Semikaro, Laini, Nduru and Shirikisho villages of Tana Delta.
On 13th Sept over 1311 paramilitary police officers to quell unrest in Tana River.
On Monday 17th Sept at around 5.45am 67 houses were torched at Ozi Village. there were no casualties reported. The next day MP Mungatana claimed that house were torched by GSU sent there earlier from Nairobi to quel the violence.
The same day (Monday 17th) police found a grave which was suspecting to be having copse. Police were issued with a court order to dig up suspected grave but found nothing apart from part of a human leg. A member of Red Cross said it was strange because there was a strong stench coming out of the area.
December Incident.
On Friday, 21 December 2012, renewed fighting ensued, with initial reports indicating the deaths of over 27 people. The brutal raid was carried out in the wee hours of the morning. Subsequent reports however confirmed that thirty nine people were killed. 
Among the dead were assailants whose corpses were burnt in anger by residents. Police also arrested over 65 suspects in the aftermath of the killings.

Swift raids

The 2006 Swift raids were a coordinated effort by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to detain and deport undocumented workers. 
On Tuesday, December 12, 2006, ICE raided six Swift & Company meatpacking plants in the midwestern United States. Workers were detained in central areas of these plants, where they were searched and interrogated. About 1,300 workers, accused of immigration violations and identity theft, were arrested and bused to detention facilities; most were deported.
ICE's "Operation Wagon Train", which culminated in the Swift raids, represented a new stage of immigration enforcement. The operation marked the beginning of increased workplace actions, as well as the special targeting of undocumented immigrants who were also accused of crimes. It was the largest workplace immigration raid in U.S. history.
Background.
Undocumented immigrants make up a significant portion of the US workforce. At Swift & Co. meatpackers (purchased soon after the raids by JBS S.A.), those arrested during the raid were 10% of the company's workforce. Because only undocumented immigrants from the first shift were arrested, the actual proportion of undocumented workers may have been substantially higher.
ICE, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), investigated Swift for ten months prior to the raid. ICE subpoenaed Swift's employee records in March 2006. It confirmed that some of Swift's employees had used Social Security information and birth certificates of others to illegally obtain employment.
Swift apparently learned that they were under investigation, and was already making efforts to decrease their reliance on undocumented workers. The company shed about 400 undocumented workers between March and December 2006. However, upon request from the DHS, Swift did not inform its workers about the coming raids. 
On November 28, 2006, Swift requested an injunction against an ICE enforcement action, arguing that they were cooperating as best they could. On December 7, the injunction was denied by District Judge Mary Lou Robinson. On December 8, ICE obtained a search warrant, which served as legal justification for the raid. The basis of this warrant was 133 suspicious cases at Swift & Co.
Raids.
On December 12, federal agents raided Swift plants in Hyrum, Utah; Greeley, Colorado; Marshalltown, Iowa; Grand Island, Nebraska; Cactus, Texas; and Worthington, Minnesota. The action against Swift & Co. was known as "Operation Wagon Train" within the DHS. It was executed by over 1,000 ICE police, in some cases backed by local police with riot gear. Thousands of workers—estimates range from 12,000 to 20,000 —were directly affected. Testimony suggests that events unfolded similarly at the six plants. 
Managers shut down assembly lines and instructed workers to report to central areas. Some resisted and were reportedly sprayed with chemical weapons. Many were handcuffed. In some plants, workers were separated into two lines on the basis of their skin color; lighter-skinned workers were dismissed more quickly, while their darker-skinned counterparts were detained. 
Agents then interrogated them and decided which to arrest—a difficult process since many had not brought identification to work on that day. Language barriers also created confusion. ICE made use of Spanish translators, but in some cases these spoke with a Guatemalan dialect and had trouble communicating with the workers.
There is disagreement over how well the detainees were treated. One person described being put in a large room with other workers and receiving McDonald's hamburgers from ICE:
“They would throw the food for us at the floor, and we had to pick it up from the floor,” Ana said. She also contends the group of 30 to 40 she was with had to share a single toilet, and the officers prohibited them from flushing it. “They closed the water (off) so that we couldn’t flush the water, because they said they were going to punish us because we kept crying and talking,” said Ana. “And they didn’t give us any toilet paper.”
Other workers said they were simply denied access to food, water, and toilets. A shot may have been fired by an ICE agent in response to one worker's attempted escape from the Swift plant in Greeley.
Friends and family outside reported being unable to contact the workers. They said that ICE police handed them sheets of paper with an area-code 800 number to dial later. 
ICE Director Julie Myers countered these claims in a written statement submitted On December 18, 2006, to the U.S. District Court in Colorado:
There were no locked doors, and no one was prevented from leaving the area. Officers ensured that the employees entered the cafeteria in a safe and orderly fashion and had properly stored their meatpacking tools, many of which were dangerous objects. Officers did not frisk the employees or act in anything but a calm and courteous manner so as to facilitate the safest environment possible. A Swift management team was present during the entire vetting and questioning period. Public telephones were available for those aliens who wanted to contact family members or friends who could bring evidence of lawful status or simply to make calls.
The period of detention in the plants typically lasted between six to eight hours, after which some workers were arrested and some were told to go home. 
In the next few days, small teams of ICE agents went from door to door in the affected communities over the next few days, looking for certain identity theft suspects.
Long-term detention and deportation.
ICE police arrested 1,297 workers and sent them on buses to federal detention centers. Arrestees were moved often, and many were quickly transported outside of their home state. The Denver Federal Center was a common early destination. Subsequent prison sites included the Denver Contract Detention Facility in Aurora, Colorado, the Otero County Detention Center in New Mexico, and Camp Dodge in Iowa. Two ministers who tried to visit detainees at Camp Dodge were unable to gain access. 
Some of the few who were later able to testify complained of further degrading treatment, unsanitary food, denial of hygiene, and isolation from friends, family, and lawyers. Myers disputed the severity of the detention and wrote that the detainees had access to lawyers. 
Most of those arrested were deported. While in detention facilities, many signed papers agreeing to voluntary deportation with no appeal. Most did not have access to telephones, lawyers, or the Consulate of their destination before they made this decision. Many of those who did not agree to voluntary deportation were detained for months longer. Some who were ultimately able to prove legal residency were held for weeks in detention facilities out of state. 
Approximately 240 of the 1,297 arrested were ultimately charged with crimes (in addition to administrative immigration violations). About 65 were charged with identity theft. 
The raid broke up couples and families. Many children were separated from their fathers; some lost both parents and had to find new places to live. Some local school systems took responsibility for supervising these children immediately after the raid; however, many children returned home from school to find their parents missing. Many people including children went into hiding, fearing that they would also be deported. 
Responses and aftermath.
On December 13, 2006, Michael Chertoff (Secretary of Homeland Security), Julie L. Myers (Director of ICE), and Deborah Platt Majoras (Chair of the Federal Trade Commission) claimed responsibility for the raid and emphasized the importance of the identity theft charges. Said Chertoff, "...this is not only a case about illegal immigration, which is bad enough. It's a case about identity theft in violation of the privacy rights and the economic rights of innocent Americans." Chertoff described the specific case of a man in Texas who was pulled over and arrested because his Social Security number was in use by an undocumented worker. Myers later called the raid "righteous" for the same reason.
Minnesota Roman Catholic bishops condemned the raid, saying it "heartlessly divided families, disrupted the whole community of Worthington and undermined progress that that city had made toward bridging racial and cultural differences." They also criticized the government for making the arrests on feast day for Our Lady of Guadalupe.
A manager and a union organizer in Marshalltown, Iowa, were later convicted of helping people to get jobs at Swift without proper documentation. No charges were brought against Swift's corporate officials. Swift complained that it was under pressure from both sides, having been sued in 2002 for discriminating against workers in its efforts to ensure that they were correctly documented. 
Many families faced severe poverty after losing one or more wage-earning members. Most did not have enough nutritious food to eat in the months after the raids. Children were shaken and upset for a long period. Living conditions became more crowded. Communities were strained by homelessness and other social needs. “It’s like a local Sept. 11,” said the director of a community crisis center in Hyrum, Utah. “You remember where you were, where you were sitting, what you were doing—and you’ll never forget.” 
The raids also had a substantial economic impact on Swift, and some business commentators claim that the loss of workers led to the company's 2007 acquisition by JBS. A 2009 study reported that Swift was paying better wages because of the need to attract new workers. Somalis, Burmese, and other political refugees from East African countries were hired to to fill the void left by the deportations. According to one 2008 law review, the severity of this action increased pressure on other employers to comply with ICE's worker verification protocol (ICE Mutual Agreement between Government and Employers, or "IMAGE").
Legal actions.
On the day after the raid, United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), the union representing the meatpacking workers, filed a petition for habeas corpus. UFCW also asked for an injunction against ICE on the grounds that they were mistreating the detainees. ICE filed a response attacking UFCW's legal standing and stating that the detainees had not been mistreated, and the case was dismissed in January.
UFCW later filed a class action suit against the ICE and DHS on Fourth and Fifth Amendment grounds. Judge Mary Lou Robinson (who had earlier denied Swift an injunction against ICE) ruled in 2009 that the class was too vague and that the union had no standing. In 2011, Judge Robinson ruled that most of the workers' claims were without merit, and agreed to the DHS's request for summary judgment.
A group of 18 workers filed a class action suit against Swift for hiring undocumented workers in an effort to depress wages. The suit was dismissed in 2009 on the grounds that, because legal and illegal workers could not be clearly separated in retrospect, the relevant class could not be ascertained.
Another lawsuit, filed by workers who were detained but not charged, accuses ICE of racial profiling and sexual harassment of detainees. This case was dismissed in 2009 by federal judge Joan Ericksen, who said that ICE's actions were justified by its search warrant. Judge Ericksen confirmed the legality of racial discrimination during the raid, stating: 
As discussed above, the affidavit in support of the warrant indicates that Defendants had evidence that suggested that a large number of illegal aliens were employed at the Worthington plant. This evidence further suggested that those suspected illegal aliens were Latino. In circumstances such as this, the government may properly consider race as a factor relevant to its decisions or actions.
Ericksen also dismissed requests for an injunction against future workplace raids.

Sentry siren

Sentry Siren, formerly known as Sterling siren, is a Civil Defense Siren brand.
History.
Sentry Siren was founded as Sterling Siren and Fire Alarm in Rochester, New York in 1905. The company began manufacture of their M-series sirens in the 1910s and 1920s. The M-series were used in fire, air-raid and disaster warning applications, and continued in production through the 1980s. The units were noted for their durability; a 1917 M-5 siren is still in use today by the Manchester, Michigan Fire Department. Today, the M-series units are considered collectibles by siren enthusiasts.
In addition to civil defense sirens, Sterling manufactured fire truck and small industrial sirens, police call boxes, and even for a short time, washing machines.
In 1976, the company relocated to Canon City, Colorado, and was renamed Sentry Siren.

Ennis Archaeological Site

The Ennis Site is an important archaeological site in the countryside southwest of Indianapolis in the U.S. state of Indiana. Located near the town of Ellettsville in Owen County, the site extends into a portion of Monroe County, near the town of Spencer. Ennis lies on the southern edge of the "Flatwoods", a small plain with outcroppings of limestone. The site itself lies in a farm field, and a large chert outcropping occupies part of the site.
Archaeologists first discovered the Ennis Site in 1979 while surveying along Hoosier Energy's proposed route for a new high-voltage power line. The initial survey observed artifacts on the site's southern edge, including the remains of a lithic workshop and a wide midden. As a result, surveyors sank fifteen test pits across the site, revealing a wide but shallow dispersion of artifacts. Because of the concentrations of artifacts found at different locations at the site, it is believed to have been a workshop where stone tools were made from the chert outcropping, as well as a campsite where the toolmakers engaged in activities such as hunting and the gathering of plants for food. Three different types of projectile points, known as "Faulkner", "McWhinney", and "Matanza", were found in the midden; taken together, they are believed to suggest that the midden was created during the middle and toward the end of the Archaic period. Other portions of the site produced artifacts as early as the Early Archaic period and as recent as the Early Woodland period, more than seven thousand years after the Early Archaic.
Ennis has yielded many different types of stone tools, including scrapers, flakes of stone, bits of charcoal, and fire-cracked stones. Because of the nearly intact midden and the long occupation of the site, the archaeologists responsible for investigating the site believed it to be important because of its potential ability to reveal the technology and the resource-gathering customs of nomadic Archaic peoples. Moreover, the site is believed to be chronologically comparable to the large Carrier Mills Archaeological District in Illinois and to a nearby pondside site that had produced remnants of many generations of nearby plants. As a result, its preservation was deemed necessary — the site needed to remain undisturbed because it could reveal crucial information about other sites both nearby and at a distance. Accordingly, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in mid-1985; it was the first Monroe County archaeological site and the only Owen County archaeological site to receive this distinction.

David Robinson (Irish politician)

David Lubbock Robinson (c.1882 – 21 August 1943) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician and a revolutionary figure in County Wicklow during the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War. 
He was born in Dublin in 1882 to the Very Reverend J.J. Robinson, who was Rector of Delgany and later the Dean of St Anne's Cathedral, Belfast. His grandfather, John Robinson, was the owner of the "Daily Express" newspaper in Dublin. His mother was the youngest daughter of Sir John W. Lubbock and a sister of the first Lord Avebury, the noted scientist. He was educated at St Columba's College and at Trinity College, Dublin and qualified as a solicitor. He was a keen hockey enthusiast and represented Ireland at international level.
After he qualified he travelled to Canada and during World War I he enlisted in the 19th Alberta Dragoons as a private and was commissioned to the Royal Marine Artillery. He had a distinguished military career and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order by the British Government and the Croix de guerre. He had lost an eye and was badly wounded in both legs during his years at the front. His cousin, Robert Barton, had resigned as a British Officer after the 1916 Easter Rising and was elected as a Sinn Féin Teachta Dála at the 1918 general election for the West Wicklow constituency. His other cousin, Erskine Childers, used his yacht, The "Asgard" to transport guns from Germany to Ireland on behalf of the Irish Volunteers. He too was a former British Army Officer but became more sympathetic with the cause of Irish independence after the events of the Rising. Robinson took an active part in the War of Independence in Wicklow. He opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty and fought on the Republican side in the Civil War. He was present in Annamoe, County Wicklow when his cousin, Erskine, was arrested by Free State Troops and taken to Dublin which would result in his court martial and execution. Robinson was himself arrested in 1922 and spent forty days on hunger strike during his eighteen months internment in Mountjoy jail. 
He was one of seven successful Fianna Fáil candidates who secured election to the Free State Seanad at the 1931 Seanad election, securing a nine-year term. Michael Comyn, the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad was appointed a Circuit Court Judge on 24 February 1936 and he resigned his seat in the Seanad. Robinson succeeded him as Leas-Chathaoirleach. He remained a member of the Seanad until its abolition in 1936. In 1938 he was nominated by then Taoiseach Éamon de Valera to the newly formed Seanad Éireann. He was nominated again to the 3rd Seanad but did not seek re-election in 1943. He was also the Secretary of the Irish Red Cross when it was inaugurated.
He died at Delgany, County Wicklow aged sixty-one years.

Amer Al Midani

Amer Mouaffac Al Midani (1957 – April 2012) was a member of the board of English football club Manchester United from 1987 to 2002 and chairman of the Manchester Giants basketball team.
Born in Beirut, Lebanon, to a Lebanese property developer, he was a Lebanese junior table tennis champion at the age of 15, and moved to England at 18. By the mid-1980s, he had become chairman of the Warrington Vikings basketball team. In 1985, he received an approach from Manchester United FC chairman Martin Edwards, who wished to make Manchester United into a multi-sport club; as part of the deal, the Vikings moved from Warrington, Cheshire, to the Stretford Sports Centre in Trafford, Greater Manchester, changed its name to Manchester United Basketball Club, and Al Midani received a seat on the Manchester United board as well as shares in the club. He remained involved with the basketball club even after they separated from Manchester United and became the Manchester Eagles (and subsequently the Manchester Giants), but had left the club by the time it folded in 2001.
In 1991, Al Midani attempted a takeover bid of Manchester United as part of a consortium that included club director and former player Bobby Charlton and would have installed Charlton as chairman, but was put off by Edwards' asking price of £30 million. He retained his shares in the club through its flotation on the London Stock Exchange later that year, but in 1997, Al Midani sold 500,000 shares in Manchester United (0.77% of the club) at around £6 each, causing an 11.5p drop in the share price. In 2002, he left the Manchester United board and was declared bankrupt after running up over £2&million of gambling debts in four days at the Rio hotel in Las Vegas.
He was also a 12 per cent shareholder in Bobby Charlton Enterprises, the main company behind the Bobby Charlton Soccer School and Charlton's ventures into "lunches with legends".

No Easy Day

No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission that Killed Osama bin Laden (2012) is a military memoir by "Mark Owen", the pseudonym of Matt Bissonnette, a former member of the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU) who participated in the mission that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden. The book details Owen's career with DEVGRU, including several combat missions in which he participated with the unit. At least half of the book focuses on Owen's participation in the mission that killed bin Laden.
Owen and his publisher's decision to release the book without first submitting it for United States Department of Defense (DoD) review generated controversy. The DoD claims that the book contains classified information, which the book's publisher denies. In late August 2012, advance publicity drove the book to the top of the Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble.com best-seller lists, bumped up the initial print run from 300,000 copies to 575,000, and led the publisher to release the book on September 4, a week earlier than the originally planned September 11 release date. It also made the "New York Times" bestseller list.
Shortly after the book's announcement, Owen's identity was revealed as Matt Bissonnette; the Department of Defense confirmed that he was the author. For media appearances, including an interview on "60 Minutes", Owen appeared incognito.
Content.
In the book, Owen chronicles his upbringing in Alaska and his long desire to be a SEAL. He recounts the rigors of his entry into DEVGRU and describes several operations in which he participated with the group in Iraq and Afghanistan. Owen also tells about his involvement in the "Maersk Alabama" hijacking rescue operation. Throughout, he describes the camaraderie, professionalism, and dedication of his teammates during extremely demanding training and dangerous combat missions.
The second half of the book details Owen's participation in the raid that targeted bin Laden. Owen writes that he was one of the team members present in the third-floor room of bin Laden's compound when the terrorist leader was killed.
In the months following the mission, Owen retired and began writing the book with the journalist Kevin Maurer. Owen says the book accurately portrays DEVGRU's relationship and involvement with Operation Neptune Spear.
The book was published by Dutton Penguin and went on sale September 4, 2012, a week before the eleventh anniversary of the September 11 attacks. Owen stated that most of the proceeds from the book will be donated to families of SEALs killed in action.
Background.
In early September 2012, a former SEAL, Brandon Webb, said he had learned Owen had decided to write the book after a "slight" from the U.S. Navy shortly before he separated from the service. According to Webb, when Owen told his comrades on SEAL Team Six that he was going to leave the service, he was ostracized by his leadership and ordered to return to his home base, although his unit was in the middle of a training exercise. The book's publisher disputed Webb's account, repeating co-author Maurer's statement that, 
"After spending several very intense months working with Mark Owen on this book, I know that he wrote this book solely to share a story about the incredible men and women defending America all over the world. Any suggestion otherwise is as ill-informed as it is inaccurate".
U.S. government response and investigations.
Before the book was released, DoD press secretary George E. Little stated that the book had yet to be evaluated for sensitive information that could potentially jeopardize national security. Lieutenant Colonel James Gregory of the Department of Defense stated that, should the book contain specialized information about SEAL weapons and tactics, Owen could potentially be charged with a criminal offense. Christine Ball of Dutton Penguin said that the contents of the book were vetted by a former special operations attorney and that sensitive content would not be an issue.
On August 25, 2012, members of al Qaeda spread Owen's personal information, calling upon militants to exact revenge upon him, identifying him as the one responsible for the death of bin Laden.
On August 30, 2012, the Pentagon announced that it was considering legal action against the former U.S. Navy SEAL for material breach of non-disclosure agreements with his first-hand account of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The DoD's chief counsel, Jeh Johnson, sent Owen a letter threatening him with legal action in an effort to pressure him and his publisher to withdraw the book from release until it could be vetted by the DoD. According to the DoD, Owen had signed a Classified Information Non-Disclosure Agreement and a 2007 Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Nondisclosure Statement that requires pre-publication security review under certain circumstances. Owen's lawyer, Robert D. Luskin, responded that the non-disclosure statements only require review of items that touch certain, highly classified programs, and Owen's book does not meet that description.
In an e-book, "No Easy Op: The Unclassified Analysis of the Book Detailing the Killing of OBL", Webb and other ex-SEALs state that Owen would have been "best served" by submitting the book for official review before its release, but understand his decision not to. Said the "No Easy Op" authors, 
"It has been our experience as writers that DOD reviews are painfully long and typically are more concerned with removing information that might make senior leadership look bad than with ensuring operational security Such a review would have come with intense scrutiny and put the integrity of the story at risk." In October 2012, the DoD informed Stanley A. McChrystal that its security review of his forthcoming memoir, "My Share of the Task", which had been under DoD review for 22 months, was not yet complete. The book's publisher was forced to postpone the book's release from its previously planned publication date of November 12, 2012.
On September 5, 2012, Pentagon officials said that Owen revealed classified information in the book and it could endanger other special operations servicemen. Department of Defense Press Secretary George Little told reporters the department "believe that sensitive and classified information is contained in the book" and called its publication without review the "height of irresponsibility."
In the book, Owen mentions several SEAL-related charities and asks readers to consider donating to those organizations. On 5 September 2012, one of the organizations, the Navy SEAL Foundation, stated that it would refuse to accept any donations related to the book or associated activities. Unnamed retired SEAL officers interviewed by the "Washington Times" stated that, in their opinion, the book does not contain classified information. The officers stated that they expected the SEAL community to shun Owen because he broke the informal code of silence that DEVGRU members traditionally adhere to.
"The Atlantic" speculated in October 2012 that Owen and his publisher had skipped a Pentagon review of their manuscript because they wanted to beat Mark Bowden's forthcoming book on the bin Laden raid, "The Finish", to market. According to Bowden, when he contacted Owen seeking an interview in "late summer" 2011, Owen asked him when Bowden's book would be published. Bowden said that he found it a little "cheap" and "cheesy" that Owen purposely planned to beat him to market while also taking a pen name, "Mark Owen", that is similar to his name, Mark Bowden. Bowden added, 
"To be honest, I hope he sells a million copies. I honestly think he is an American hero. Here’s a guy who spent ten years fighting these wars, and if anybody deserves to sell a lot of books, it’s him. I wish him well. I’m glad to have had the input his book. I would rather have had it directly myself, but I completely understand why he did it the way he did."
In November 2012, it was revealed that seven SEALs, recruited by Owen, had been disciplined for revealing classified information to a video game company. Owen recruited seven of his former SEAL members to serve as paid consultants where they revealed details. They received a letter of reprimand, called "a career killer" since it makes them unable to receive promotions, and had their wages cut for two months. All failed to notify their commanding officer and go through the proper channels; they revealed specifics, including showing their equipment to the game makers.
Reception.
Reviews.
Kim Curtis of the Associated Press stated that the book's strengths were its cast of characters including Owen, and its "remarkably intimate glimpse into what motivates men striving to join an elite fighting force like the SEALs—and what keeps them there". He compliments the book's "breathlessly paced, inexorable march toward an inevitable ending".
Dexter Filkins, journalist and Pulitzer Prize finalist, wrote positively about the book, but described the end as giving off "a tacky feel". He explains "Owen suggests that he doesn’t think much of President Obama, doesn’t have much respect for the civilians who ordered the raid and believes, more or less, that anyone in war who doesn’t carry a gun is a wimp". Owen "seems to resent the fact that Obama took credit for the raid and at one point even resisted signing a framed flag for him, on the now-preposterous grounds that he didn’t want his identity revealed". Filkins concludes: "This is the carping of a warrior with little appreciation of what his country actually stands for—like that messy thing called democratic politics. After all, he’s just a killing machine".
Tony Perry of the "Los Angeles Times" called the book an "important historical document" and "brisk and compelling in its telling of the training, execution and immediate aftermath of the bin Laden mission by the elite SEAL Team 6." He noted that Owen's efforts to protect his fellow SEALs' identities introduced some "blandness" into his story.
Janet Maslin of the "New York Times" described the book as an "exciting, suspenseful account" of how Owen trained for the bin Laden and other, potentially dangerous missions. Maslin added that the book's details of certain aspects of the bin Laden raid were "shocking and revelatory".
Gary Anderson wrote for "The Washington Times" that the book's "author and his co-writer have done what they set out to do. They give a feel for the sights, sounds and emotions of the raid and how the special operations forces of the United States train for and plan such operations." Anderson says that he has a "problem" with the author's decision to write the book, saying, "open-source information about special operations set out in this way puts our troops and their missions in danger."
Sales.
On September 13, 2012, the book replaced "Fifty Shades of Grey" atop "USA Today's" bestselling books list. Dutton Penguin stated that the book's print run for its first week of sales was up to 1 million copies, not counting e-books. "USA Today" stated that hardback versions were outselling e-versions.
Although Owen was rumored to be in talks with DreamWorks and Steven Spielberg to turn the book into an action movie, a representative for DreamWorks and Spielberg said the director does not have any plans to make the book into a movie.

Chris Barber (philanthropist)

Christopher Bayldon "Chris" Barber (19 March 1921 – 8 July 2012) was a British Quaker businessman and was the Chairman of Oxfam from 1983 to 1989. He was educated at Bootham School, York.
War.
As a Quaker, 18-year-old Chris Barber, was opposed to war and chose to join the Friends Ambulance Unit before he was called up. He faced a Conscientious Objector Tribunal, refusing to seek favourable treatment by declaring himself a Quaker. He was, however, permitted to join the FAU, with whom he worked until 1947. His service included a period of war relief work in China.
The Biscuits business.
When he returned, he trained as an accountant and joined the family firm, Jacob's Biscuits, in 1949. By innovations, mergers and acquisitions, the firm grew to become Huntley & Palmer then Associated Biscuits and he rose to be Finance Director. He retired in 1980.
Famine relief.
In 1980, he had joined the Board of Trustees of Oxfam. In 1983, he became its Chair, in which role, he served until 1989. "Oxfam grew dramatically and, in his role as chairman, Chris was keen to ensure that the extra donations were used well, not just to tackle famine but to ensure sustainable development thereafter. His was a wise and compassionate hand on the tiller."
He was a "hands-on" Chair and was deeply concerned with Oxfam's decision, in November 1985, to close its bank account at Barclays Bank because of Barclays involvement with the South African Apartheid regime. He travelled to South America, India and Sudan and sorted out a diplomatic disaster in Cambodia. Long after his retirement, he could be found, helping out, at the Oxfam bookshop in Henley.

He served on Quaker Peace and Service Central Committee from 1993 to 1998
Other activities.
The obituary in "The Henley Standard" said: ". . . he was known for organising treasure hunts on and around Peppard Common and many other activities involving local families.
For several years he organised a hockey match at New Year on a field near the Dog in Peppard with 20 or 30 people, from small children to ageing grandparents, on each side and no referee! Fortunately, the games were all played in good spirit and there were no injuries. On one occasion, the match was played in deep snow.".

Tym River, Sakhalin

The Tym River () is a river on the island of Sakhalin, Russia, and the second longest river on the island after the Poronai River. The name of the river is translated from Nivkh as "spawning river." The river flows through Tymovsky and Nogliki Districts of Sakhalin Oblast. It begins on the southern slopes of Mount Lopatin in the East Sakhalin Mountains, flows through swampy lowlands in the Tym-Poronaiskaya Valley, and finally flows into Nyisky Bay in the Sea of Okhotsk. The villages of Tymovskoye and Nogliki are located beside the river.
The river is mostly fed by snowmelt. The Tym freezes between November and early December, and the spring break occurs between the end of April and May. The highest level of flow has been observed in the second week of May, and the lowest has been observed in the third week of August. There are about 400 lakes in the river's basin, with a combined area of about 9.5 km².
The largest tributaries of the Tym are listed below, with their length in kilometers given in parentheses:
Right tributaries
Left tributaries
The river is navigable by rafts and light boats up to from its mouth. The passage of typhoons can bring significant flooding. The Tym and its tributaries are rich in spawning salmon.
Some agriculture is carried out in the Tym River valley, producing potatoes and vegetables, as well as raising cattle for meat and dairy products. Although the growing season averages less than 100 days, Soviet scientists optimistically called the river valley "the granary of Sakhalin". To this end, a collective farm called "Krasnaya Tym" ("Red Tym"; coordinates ) was established in Soviet times. Timber is also harvested in the valley.

Vivian de Buffrénil

Vivian de Buffrénil is a French histologist and paleobiologist who has been working at the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris since 1982. His doctorate (1980) and his doctorat d'état (1990), a diploma now replaced by the habilitation, were supervised by Armand de Ricqlès. His main fields of interest include basic histological descriptions, growth dynamics as recorded in bone growth marks, and adaptation (both histological and microanatomical) of the tetrapod skeleton to a secondarily aquatic lifestyle. He is also interested in life history and population dynamics of exploited or threatened reptile taxa, especially among Varanidae and Crocodilia. He has published at least 92 papers, including 76 research papers, 10 reports on exploited or threatened species, and six popular papers.
His first papers dealt with the skeletal growth marks in extant crocodilians, but very soon after that, he also tackled paleobiological issues, such as growth of an Eocene crocodilian then identified as "Crocodylus" cf. "affinis". Other extinct taxa on which he has published include the Ypresian crocodilian "Dyrosaurus phosphaticus", thalattosuchian crocodilians, the Triassic presumed ichthyosaur "Omphalosaurus nisseri", other ichthyosaurs, the Permian diapsid "Claudiosaurus germaini", champsosaurids, the placodont "Placodus", Plesiosauria, the early snakes "Simoliophis" and "Eupodophis", and the mosasaur "Carentonosaurus mineaui" among reptiles, and early cetaceans and sirenians among mammals. While his early papers typically dealt with only one or two taxa each, some of his most recent studies are based on comparative datasets including several taxa.
As a recognized leader in bone histology, he evaluates drafts regularly for several journals and serves on the editorial board (as Reviewing Editor) of the Comptes Rendus Palevol of the Académie des sciences (France). So far, his work has been cited more than 1350 times in scholarly works, according to Google Scholar.

Canadian Hockey League Players' Association

The Canadian Hockey League Players' Association (CHLPA) is a proposed labour union that seeks to represent the players of the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) and its three constituent leagues: the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) and Western Hockey League (WHL). The CHLPA's primary focus revolves around the education packages the three leagues offer players during and after their junior hockey careers. Its executive director is former National Hockey League (NHL) player Georges Laraque.
The CHL resisted the union's creation, and was faced with threats of lawsuits by the union for operating in "sweatshop" conditions. Believing the association was being evasive in requests to identify the individuals behind the union, the CHL hired private investigators. The CHLPA fell into disarray two months after its founding over questions of whether Randy Gumbley, a man twice convicted of defrauding junior hockey players, was involved. Laraque announced on November 1, 2012, that he would step down as executive director once he handed the fledgling union over to an established body.
Formation.
The proposed players' association first emerged in August 2012. CHLPA spokesman Derek Clarke stated the union had gone public with its intents after 14 months of planning and with representatives from all 60 of the CHL's teams. The CHLPA announced it intends to seek certification in each province that CHL teams operate as well as the United States. A "Peterborough Examiner" story revealed the CHLPA's existence, stated the association adopted its constitution on August 9, 2012, and formed a board of governors. The association named former NHL player Georges Laraque its first executive director on August 21, 2012.
While Clarke claimed the CHLPA had widespread support from players, most stated they were not aware of the proposed association's goals, and some had never heard of it. When asked, Peterborough Petes' goaltender Andrew D'Agostini stated: "I can’t complain about the things I have gotten out of this league. The experience of playing for Team Canada. Playing in the Subway Series. You’re always decked out in nice gear and are given free stuff. I’m sure I have gone through thousands of dollars worth of hockey sticks alone. I know I have been well taken care of. I don’t know what to say."
Support amongst players for the union was mixed. The "Sarnia Observer" interviewed several Sarnia Sting players who were supportive of the effort, including captain Nathan Chiarlitti: "they raise a couple of solid points and I agree with them, I have no problem backing that up." Other teams, including the WHL's Saskatoon Blades, were less receptive.
Proposals.
Speaking with Rogers Sportsnet, Clarke outlined the goals the CHLPA hoped to achieve. He stated the primary focus of the association was to improve the education packages the CHL and its member leagues offer. Specifically:
CHL response.
CHL president David Branch countered the CHLPA's claims in an August 22 press release, arguing that his organization's programs are sufficient and challenged the association's certification plans. In his statement, he claimed: "our league is 60 teams, all of which operate as individual corporate entities. Given this structure, any organization drive would be required to be at an individual team level." Additionally, Branch claimed that his organization had not received any notification that the CHLPA intended to organize as a body to represent major junior players.
Certification efforts.
The CHLPA accused the WHL's Alberta teams of disrupting unionization meetings and cutting organizing players' ice time as punishment. Additionally, it sent letters to all 60 teams threatening them with lawsuits over what it described as running "sweatshops" and for the "blatant disregard for the bare minimum working standards that have been set for employees.". The union then filed legal claims against the Halifax Mooseheads in Nova Scotia, promising it would be "the first of many". 
The CHL, meanwhile, received complaints from players about late-night calls from union representatives from blocked numbers. Stating it was acting for the players' security, the league hired private investigators to try and identify who Derek Clarke is. The CHLPA's organization efforts were thrown into disarray at the start of November 2012 when questions surfaced as to whether Clarke is actually Randy Gumbley, a man twice convicted of defrauding junior hockey players. In a television interview, Laraque identified a photograph of Gumbley as being Derek Clarke, but denied they were the same person in a subsequent interview. The CHLPA denied that Randy Gumbley is involved with the association, but rather his brother Glenn is. The Sports Network's Dave Naylor, meanwhile, claimed he had spoken to more than one person calling themselves Derek Clarke.
The CHLPA had already received the required support from the players on the QMJHL's Sherbrooke Phoenix and had scheduled a vote with the players on the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles. However, the union's ratification efforts collapsed after the confusion over Clarke's identity was revealed. The vote in Cape Breton was cancelled after its application was withdrawn. At the same time, legal representatives for the CHLPA in Alberta and Quebec cut ties, and the player behind the action against the Halifax Mooseheads withdrew his complaint. With the CHLPA's future left in doubt, Georges Laraque announced on November 1 that he would step down as executive director once the association could be transitioned into an established organization.

First class facilities of the RMS Titanic

The RMS "Titanic" had extensive facilities for first-class passengers
Location.
The first-class passengers of the "Titanic" were placed in the central part of the ship where the vibrations and roll of the ship are at their lowest. Many of the first class facilities were located on A Deck. But the first class rooms were located from E Deck up.
Sporting and relaxation facilities.
The "Titanic" featured numerous sporting and relaxation facilities including:
Cafés and restaurants.
À la Carte Restaurant.
The À la Carte Restaurant was a luxurious restaurant open exclusively to first-class passengers. The restaurant, which was the preferred alternative to the main dining saloon, gave passengers the option of enjoying lavish meals at an additional cost. Unlike the main dining saloon, the restaurant gave passengers the freedom to eat whenever they liked (between 8 am and 11 pm). The restaurant was not managed by the White Star Line; Luigi Gatti ran it as a concession and his staff were not part of the regular crew.
The restaurant was decorated in the Louis XVI style and lit by picture windows. Axminster carpets covered the floors and small tables, which accommodated two to eight people, were set with porcelain plates and lit by crystal lamps. The À la Carte Restaurant provided the most intimate atmosphere on board. In fact, half of the tables in the restaurant catered for two people, whereas very few of such tables were offered in the main dining saloon.
The passengers often referred to the restaurant as the "Ritz". Ms. Walter Douglas, a first-class passenger who survived the shipwreck, gave her account of the À la Carte Restaurant: 
On the night of the sinking, the Wideners, a wealthy couple from Philadelphia, hosted a dinner party at the restaurant in honour of Captain Smith.
The restaurant had its own reception room located next to the aft grand staircase on B Deck. The first-class reception room was decorated in the Georgian style: armchairs and settees were draped in carmine-coloured silk; and a space was reserved for the orchestra. This room allowed passengers to gather together before and after their meals.
Dining Saloon.
On D Deck, there was an enormous first-class dining saloon, measuring 1,000 m2, which accommodated up to 554 passengers. In total, there were 115 tables, set for 2 to 12 people. Children were allowed to eat here with their parents, as long as the dining saloon was not fully booked.
The dining saloon was decorated in wooden panelling, painted white, and the floors were covered in blue linoleum tiles, featuring an elaborate red and yellow pattern. The room’s portholes were elegantly concealed by inner leaded-glass windows, giving passengers the impression that they were eating onshore instead of at sea. For even more atmosphere, the windows were lit from behind during the evening meals. The dining saloon’s meals were prepared in the kitchen next door, which also serviced the second-class dining saloon, similarly located on D Deck. Also the tables had fresh, silky shade lamps fitted onto the linen covered tables passengers could look at while dining.
The dining saloon was open between 1 to 2:30 pm for lunch, and between 6 to 7:30 pm for dinner. Passengers were alerted to when meals were being served by the ship’s bugler, Peter W. Fletcher, playing "The Roast Beef of Old England". On Sundays, the dining saloon was also used for the Anglican Church service, which was conducted by the captain or, in his absence, by a minister traveling in first class. The service was accompanied by a quintet, which included a piano. Contrary to what has often been portrayed in films, the orchestra did not play during meals.
Verandah Café.
The Verandah Café (also known as Palm Court) was divided into two rooms, located on both sides of the second-class staircase, on A Deck. Reminiscent of an outdoor sidewalk café, its rooms were brightly lit by large windows and double sliding doors that opened onto the first-class Promenade Deck. The café was elegantly furnished with wicker tables and chairs, spread out across a checkerboard tiled floor. Various outdoor plants filled the rooms, including potted palm trees and ivy-covered trellises. First-class passengers could enjoy a selection of refreshments in the café. Also, the tables were fitted with yellow flowers in crystal clear glass vases which the passengers looked at during dining.
The Verandah Café had both smoking and non-smoking sections. The smoking section, located on the port side, was accessible from the first-class smoking room. The non-smoking section, located on the starboard side, was used as a play area by mothers and children. To note, no such official area existed on board. Contrary to the "Titanic's", the "Olympic’s" non-smoking section was frequently deserted.
The Verandah Café was similar in style on both the "Olympic" and the "Titanic". While there are many photos of the "Olympic’s" café, only one photo of the "Titanic’s" remains today.
Café Parisien.
The Café Parisien was a new feature on the "Titanic", designed to replace part of the "Olympic’s" Promenade Deck that was rarely used. Located on the starboard side on B Deck, the café was connected to the À la Carte Restaurant.
Like the restaurant, the Café Parisien was open from 8:00 am to 11:00 pm and shared the same menu and servers. The café was furnished with wicker tables and chairs, accommodating up to 68 passengers, and was decorated in ivy-covered trellises and other climbing plants. The Café Parisien was most popular among young adults.
In 1912, the British magazine "The Shipbuilder" gave the following description of the café:
Gathering places.
There were many other venues that could be visited by first-class passengers, including:
Smoking room.
The first-class passengers could enjoy a Georgian style smoking room, found in the back of A Deck. In keeping with social conventions of the time, the room was exclusive to men.--> In order to recreate the same atmosphere of a gentlemen’s club, the room was decorated with dark mahogany panelling inlaid with mother-of-pearl, numerous stained-glass windows, and alcoves.
The floor was laid with blue and red linoleum tiles. In the center of the far-back wall was a Norman Wilkinson painting, "Plymouth Harbour", which hung over the fireplace. This was the only real fireplace on board: the others used electricity. The furniture was upholstered in leather, of an unknown colour (probably green or burgundy).
The room was accessible from the aft grand staircase, and to the right of the fireplace was a revolving door which lead to the Verandah Café. The room was U-shaped in order to permit the smoke from the fireplace to be vented out. This area also included bathrooms.
The smoking room was the preferred spot of gamblers who crossed the Atlantic. Professional card sharps also travelled on board under aliases, and the purser could do nothing but warn passengers about these swindlers, since passengers played at their own risk. At least four professional players travelled on board the Titanic. Cigars and drinks could be made available upon request of the passengers, and were provided by the stewards of the adjacent bar.
Reception hall.
The first-class dining saloon of the "Titanic" was connected to a large reception hall, measuring , located at the foot of the fore grand staircase on D Deck. An ornate candelabra rested on the middle railing at the base of the stairs. The hall was also close to two halls (one on each side of the ship) that were intended to accommodate part of the first-class passengers upon boarding. It was decorated in the Jacobean style and its walls were white and embellished with mouldings; the floor was covered with thick, colourful, wall-to-wall carpeting. An imposing Aubusson tapestry, "La Chasse du duc de Guise", hung in front of the staircase. On the wall close to the tapestry were letters indicating the name of the deck.
The hall had a large number of wicker chairs and tables, and could hold up to 600 people. In fact, it was recorded on the inaugural voyage of the Olympic, whose reception hall was slightly smaller, the room quickly filled up after dinner. On the starboard side, there was an area reserved for a quintet and it held a Steinway grand piano.
The hall was open to passengers before and after meals. Here, the orchestra played from 4 to 5 pm while tea was served, then after dinner, from 8 to 9:15 pm. Stewards served liquor and cigars until 11 pm, at which time the hall closed. Generally, there were many spectators in the hall while the orchestra played. Then, the passengers returned to the other rooms in the ship.
Grand Staircase.
The Grand Staircase of the RMS Titanic was one of the most notable first class features aboard. It extended down from the boat deck, down to E-Deck where the landing down to F-Deck was down to an ordinary small mid landing stairwell. The top fitted a circular, roof headed dome to let light in through the first class areas. Above the mid landing, on the boat deck level forward wall, was placed a carved grandfather clock representing Honor and Glory Crowning Time. On A-Deck level, on the mid rail, rested a bronze brown cherub holding a lamp. On D-Deck, there was a stand or some safe-like object, also on top of the mid rail, that held the ornate reception room candelabra. Behind the staircase led the 3 running first class elevators going from E-Deck to A-Deck. A mirror and a chair was in each of those lifts.
The Grand Staircase was so grand that some people nicknamed it the staircase to heaven. The piano on the boat deck level led a musician that played it during the evenings on both Titanic and Olympic.
There were also a number of stairwell posts that helped keep the stairwell sturdy and beautiful. In the 1997 movie "Titanic" John Jacob Astor holds onto one as he dies in the sinking.
Many people after dinner strolled up these steps to the boat deck or commented to crew of how well they did on the ship and how beautiful it was. Except this was not the only "Grand Staircase for first class" on the Titanic; another twin staircase for first class, far aft after the third funnel, had kind of the same beauty. Except that the cherub was a bit petite, the clock was not as ornate as the forward first class stairs, and it only extended from A-Deck to C-Deck. There were also no elevators for passengers for this stairwell, so the weathy and rich who wanted to use the lifts or disabled first class passengers had to travel back to the front to use them.

Grimhaven

Grimhaven is the manuscript for a unpublished book by hard-boiled crime writer Charles Willeford. Originally intended as Willeford's sequel to "Miami Blues", the novel was deemed too dark for publication, and his agent refused to send it on to the publisher. The novel "New Hope for the Dead" was later written and published as the second book in the Hoke Moseley series.
A photocopy of the hand-typed manuscript is maintained in the Charles Willeford Archive at the Bienes Museum of the Modern Book in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The holdings inventory notes: "as per Betsy Willeford of the author: 'Ms. of the "black Hoke Mosely" , never published, sold to a small but ruthless group of collectors in the form of Xerox copies. May not be copied in the library by patrons who'll wholesale it on the Internet.'"
Synopsis.
The novel begins with Hoke Moseley's having retired from the Miami police force to work at his father Frank Moseley's hardware store in Riviera Beach, Florida in exchange for a free apartment at the beach on Singer Island and a small paycheck. He makes himself useful by organizing the store and cleaning up, though he does not want to interact with customers in his new simplified life. In the wake of his career with the Miami police department, the more mindless the task, the better Hoke likes it.
Hoke has simplified and streamlined his life with a very strict and frugal regimen. He has a sparsely furnished apartment at the beach in a tourist area where he goes for a swim and a run every day after work. He has two yellow poplin jumper suits, one of which he wears and washes by hand every day with the other remaining in reserve. He has almost no possessions and sleeps on an army cot. His spartan diet consists of cooking a pot of beef stew or chili every Sunday to last a week of dinners with an apple each day for dessert. His routine breakfast is a poached egg, one slice of rye toast, and several cups of Cuban espresso. His daily lunch consists of a hard boiled egg and an apple, supplemented with a thermos of coffee. Instead of owning a radio or a television, he works through a book of beginner chess problems after dinner each night. 
Hoke's idyllic and simple life is brought to a sudden halt by the unexpected arrival of his daughters Sue Ellen and Aileen at his apartment. His ex-wife Patsy abandons them to Hoke's care while she moves to California with her professional baseball player boyfriend, Curly Peterson. Hoke immediately begins adjusting his plans. Because Sue Ellen is sixteen, he says that she is "finished with high school" and should immediately get a job to help out with the finances. Aileen is legally obligated to continue school, so her job will be maintaining the house and preparing meals for the three of them.
Hoke is informed by his father that he and his wife Helen will be going on a three-month-long cruise around the world and that Hoke needs to take care of the hardware store in his absence. His father offers financial help, but Hoke refuses. His father even offers to let them stay in his house while they are away, but Hoke refuses on that grounds that the girls should go ahead and become accustomed to their new lives of austerity. Hoke's balanced life is starting to fray around the edges, as is evidenced by a tension headache emerging during his evening run, something he had not experienced since he was on the police force. After a terrible meal of overcooked stew prepared by Aileen, he realizes that he has greatly over-estimated the maturity and abilities of both his daughters, that the situation is not going to work, and that he does not know what to do about it.
The first weekend with the girls begins with Hoke manning the hardware store by himself while the girls unpack their things and adjust to their new surroundings. Lunch is prepared by the time he gets home and the three make a trip to the laundromat. Aileen complains about her braces being uncomfortable, and rather than take her to a dentist, Hoke makes arrangements with his pilot neighbor, Bobby Stukes, to remove them that evening. He has Stukes pretend to have been a dentist in the Air Force. They drug Aileen with some Tylenol 3 and half a Valium before snipping all the braces out of her mouth. 
After finishing the dental work, Hoke and Bobby take a swim in the ocean and then go to the Green House beer garden nearby and have a conversation on a variety of topics, the most significant of which reveals the reason for Hoke's early retirement from police work. Hoke explains that he had to kill someone in the line of duty and he enjoyed it so much that is scared him. After returning home from the Green House, the three Moseleys have a sad dinner of leftover stew while Hoke brutally explains the birds and the bees to the girls and the rules regarding sexual conduct in their new home. After dinner, they collect discarded bottles on the beach to return for the deposit money.
On Sunday Hoke leaves the girls to their own devices and spends some time in the solitude of the closed hardware store. He ponders options for adjusting to this new situation in his life and makes careful plans on a legal pad before tearing the sheet up and disposing of it in the toilet. The evening is spent having Sunday dinner with the girls at his father's house. His father blindsides him by having the local Riviera Beach police chief there to offer him a better paying job as a lieutenant in charge of the detective division. His father is concerned about Hoke's financial ability to continue raising the girls. Regardless of the good offer, Hoke is determined not to do police work any more. Frank's wife Helen implores Hoke to live in the house with the girls while they are away on their three-month cruise, but Hoke maintains that they will not stay there. The girls balk and argue with Hoke and they have a tense ride home.
That evening, Hoke kills his two daughters. In preparation, he turns the air conditioner down to seventy degrees and has a Aileen write a note in her own handwriting saying that they have decided to go live with their mother in California. After the girls are asleep, he waits on the porch smoking the rest of Sue Ellen's cigarettes until his neighbor Bobby Stukes comes home. He has several drinks of bourbon at Bobby's house and then sits out on his porch until very late in the night. At 3:00 AM, he enters the girls' room and strangles them in their sleeping bags, breaking the little finger on his right hand in the process. He wraps the two corpses in trash bags and stows them in the closet. He makes himself a sandwich from the leftover stew meat and heads to the hardware store at 6:00 AM.
The day after the murder is spent visiting the Riviera Beach police chief to inform him that Hoke will not be taking the job since his daughters have decided to return to their mother in California. He shows the note Aileen wrote to the police chief and explains that they were gone when he woke up that morning. Hoke tells the same basic story to his father later in the morning. That afternoon Hoke goes to the doctor to have his broken finger reset, explaining that he broke it while closing the door of his truck. On the way home, he realizes that there is no air conditioning vent in the closet, so he gets four fifty-pound blocks of ice and moves the corpses into the shower stall with the ice. He spends the next several days attempting to return to his old routine with varied amounts of success.
On Saturday morning, Hoke drives his father and Helen to Port Everglades to board their cruise ship. On returning to Riviera Beach, Hoke goes to the hardware store and fills out a company check to himself for $3000. He spends the afternoon having a casual meal at a restaurant and then goes to the see the movie "Death Hunt" before stopping by his father's house to turn the air conditioner down to sixty degrees. At 10:00 PM he moves the body bags to his truck, realizing they are somewhat waterlogged due to the fact he had not removed them when he took his daily showers. He drives the bodies to his father's house and brings them in through the garage and seals them up as best he can under sheets in the master bed in order to suppress the smell. He spends the next several days relaxing in his father's house before leaving town on U.S. Highway 1 on the way to California.
What follows is an account of every meal Hoke eats, every hotel, motel, or boarding house he stays in, and several minor interactions with other people on his week-long drive to California in his truck. Once in Los Angeles, Hoke arbitrarily picks a lawyer named Juan Peralta from an office building registry and hires him on retainer so that he will have someone to call when he is arrested. After securing the lawyer's services, Hoke drives to a Sears store to purchase a double-barreled shotgun and some shells on his way to Glendale, where Patsy and Curly Peterson live on Eucalyptus Avenue in the Verdugo Woodlands.
Hoke scopes out the house before having lunch in downtown Glendale and seeing the movie "Local Hero" at the Rialto Theater. Upon returning to his parking space, he finds that his truck has been stolen from the lot. A policeman named Arthur Arthur attempts to help find the truck, and they drive together around Glendale looking for it. Finally the policeman drops Hoke off at Patsy's and Curly's house. Hoke and Patsy have a conversation on the front porch before he forces his way into the house. Hoke waits smoking cigarettes and drinking a beer Patsy brings him in the study while some guests leave. He finds a letter opener in a desk and hides it in the back pocket of his jumpsuit. 
When Curly and Patsy enter the room, Hoke botches an attempt to kill Curly with the letter opener. Curly overpowers him and ends up kicking the false teeth of his mouth. Curly has no interest in involving the police, but police officer Arthur arrives back at the house to let Hoke know his truck has been found. Hoke makes a hasty exit with the officer and goes to retrieve his car where the ignition is being repaired at a garage. He then drives south of town on U.S. Highway 101 to Seal Beach, where he checks into a motel to spends his final few days before being apprehended by the police. His reasoning for the crime spree is the solitude he will find on Death Row until he is executed, enjoying the privacy of a single cell, working on his chess problems and reading, left to his own devices.

Azov radar

The Azov radar (, NATO: Flat Twin, also RSN-225 ()) in Kamchatka was a Soviet military radar in the Russian Far East with the GRAU index 5K17. It was designed for the S-225 anti-ballistic missile system which was never commissioned. The radar was later installed near the Kura Test Range and was demolished in 2006.
S-225.
The radar was built as part of the S-225 anti-ballistic missile system (NATO name: ABM-X-3), a mobile system designed to defend high status targets against attack by ballistic missiles. Work started on the system in the early 1960s and S-225 was one of three competing systems; A-35 (the one chosen) and "Saturn" were the others.
S-225 was designed by A.A. Raspletin, who worked in special design bureau OKB-31, of KB-1 design bureau. The first design was done in 1964 and the first prototype of the system was installed in Sary Shagan in 1971, at site 53 (). The radar was tested on the descent phase of missiles launched from the Kapustin Yar military launch range. Because of this it was decided that the second prototype should be installed in Kamchatka, near the Kura Test Range, to pick up missiles landing there after being launched elsewhere in the Soviet Union. In 1975 this second prototype was installed and checked in Sary Shagan and then dismantled and shipped to Vladivostok to be installed in Kamchatka.
S-225 consisted of the Azov radar, a device transmitting commands to the missiles which NATO called "Pawn Shop", and two types of missiles. One missile, 5Ya27, was designed by OKB Fakel for exoatmospheric intercepts (above the atmosphere). The other, 5Ya26 was designed by OKB Novator for endoatmospheric intercepts (within the atmosphere).
Radar.
The Azov was a moveable phased array radar. The CIA estimated it could be installed in six weeks. It contained separate receive and transmit sections. The array was mounted on a pedestal and could be moved in azimuth and elevation. It is listed as being associated with the Russian space surveillance system in 2004.

The Basement Massacre II

The Basement Massacre II is an American short horror film produced and created by StompzOnU Productions. It is a sequel to the StompzOnU Productions short horror film "The Basement Massacre", the story of two boys who have just finished eating dinner and individually make their way to the basement to face an unknown killer, which in itself is a loose remake of the short comedy film" Crap Happens In A Basement", another StompzOnU Productions release. The film premiered on YouTube on August 17, 2012, about a month after being filmed. The idea for the movie was brought up almost 6 months before it began filming, with the intention of it being 20 minutes, while the running time ended up being a little under 7 minutes after editing. A third movie was first brought up by Luke Peters of SOUP and then fellow-filmmaker, Trevor. The film is now being taken into consideration and Gervasi is seeking Michael M., a member of SOUP on a long-time hiatus, as a contributing writer.
Synopsis.
Two young boys, Luke and Andre, tell their parents they are going to sleep over at each other's houses but are actually going to stay at an abandoned house with a legend of murders in the basement surrounding it. The house which turns out to be the house in the first film, also turns out to be not so abandoned, something the boys should have realized from the lived in state of the house.
Anticipation.
The movie was greatly anticipated in the month between filming and release. StompzOnU Productions released two re-edits of the original movie, called the Scream! version and Nooo! version. The Scream! version was in black & white and had more focused camera angles. It also had a slightly alternate opening. This re-edit was meant to pay homage to 1950s and '60s horror films such as "Psycho". The Nooo! version also has another alternate opening and more focused camera angles along with increased brightness. This version was created to pay homage to 1970s and '80s horror films such as "Texas Chain Saw Massacre". There was also a short horror video game created and premiered on YouTube called The Rooms of Horror, which featured the player running down different hallways and avoiding different killers. This game, although unrelated to "The Basement Massacre II", was created to draw more attention to it.
The Killer.
The killer, played by director and writer of both films, Nicholas L. Gervasi, is an unknown knife wielder who also has a knack for using unconventional murder weapons such as a giant self-made cross and an acoustic guitar. The first film featured him wearing a newspaper for a mask, inspired by a short story written by Gervasi around 3rd or 4th grade called "The Newsroom Massacre" and encouraged by the movie "Friday the 13th Part 2". The second movie featured a paper towel for a mask. This was because the mask from the first film was in too poor condition to be worn again. The filmmakers also thought that, since the film takes place a while later, it would make sense for the kiler to create a new mask for himself. The killer has remained naimless in the films, but among Nicholas L. Gervasi and fellow filmmaker, Trevor, is referred to as The Lurker. References to The Lurker will be included in the upcoming horror film created by Trevor, "Asylum". Gervasi will also have a part in "Asylum" but not as the killer. The Lurker can also be seen featured in comcis on deviantart.com by Nick as inoyu49 and by the RemnantsoftheNext Civilization. It is not referenced in the TBM II that the killer was supposedly killed at the end of TBM I. The end consisted of the second boy (played by short film comedy actor Thomas B.; his character credited as Victim 2) whacking the killer in the head with a rusty saw. The killer then falls to the floor. Since this is not mentioned in TBM II, it is assumable that the hit ws not fatal. Unlike the first film, the killer triumphs in the second film. The killer's face is revealed for the first time at the end of TBM II.
Crap Happens In A Basement.
Although Gervasi played the killer in all the TBM films, the short comedy "Crap Happens In A Basement" on which The Basement Massacre is loosely based stars Gervasi as a victim with SOUPs' Michael M. as the killer. "Crap Happens In A Basement" featured Gervasi (character credited as Fag Boy) looking for several items in a basement. While looking for these items he hears a voice that says these items resemble penises. The boy cannot trace the voice. The video ends with a little girl walking into the basement looking for Fag Boy/"Jake". The ending of the movie was not filmed due to time limitations, but instead was written in the description of the video and describes the killer confronting the girl and openly admitting to the murder of the boy. This film, unlike most SOUP films, debuted on the YouTube channel Emin3m710. Most SOUP films premiere on YouTube on the channel inoyu49, the official SOUP channel. None of the people from "Crap Happens", except for Nick, contributed to the "The Basement Massacre" series.

Jonathan Winship

Jonathan Winship III (1780-1843) was an American 19th-century sailor and entrepreneur, the son and grandson of Jonathan Winships I and II, who in 1775 established a cattle market in Brighton, Massachusetts which became the largest in the state. In the early 1800s Winship was Captain of the Winship family's "O'Cain" trading vessel on all but its first voyage (when he was first mate), trading across the Pacific. Winship is credited with the first recorded entry into Humboldt Bay by sea, in June 1806. Winship Point and O'Cain Point in the South Shetland Islands are named for Winship and his vessel.
The War of 1812 led Winship to seek refuge in China, where he acquired horticultural skills. In 1820 he and his brother Francis founded a horticultural company, and later he played a key role in the founding of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society.

Andrew Bruce Holmes

Andrew Bruce Holmes, AM FRS FAA FinstP (born 5 September 1943) is an Australian and British senior research chemist and professor at the Bio21 Institute, Melbourne, Australia. His research interests lie in the synthesis of biologically-active natural products (spanning therapeutic materials to new biotechnological probes) and optoelectronic polymers (with applications to electroluminescent flexible displays and organic solar cells).
Career.
Andrew Holmes' undergraduate studies and masters' research were conducted at the University of Melbourne in Australia. Travelling to the UK on a Shell Overseas Science Scholarship, he performed his PhD work at University College London under the supervision of Franz Sondheimer.
As a postdoctoral researcher, Holmes worked on the total synthesis of Vitamin B12 with Albert Eschenmoser.
In 1972 he was appointed as a demonstrator to the University of Cambridge where he stayed for 32 years, ultimately as Professor of Organic and Polymer Chemistry, and Director of the Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis where he oversaw the founding and initial decade of the Melville Laboratory.
Holmes' early work at Cambridge expanded his interest in new techniques for synthesising small molecules that are biologically-active and practically-useful, including natural products (such as alkaloids) and peptidomimetics. In 1989, during systematic characterisation of a newly synthesised conductive polymer, Chloe Jennings working in Holmes' research group observed that the polymer emitted light when a current was passed through it. An intensive period of research in Holmes' group, and other polymer chemistry groups, led to the discovery of differently-coloured light-emitting polymers that spanned the visible colour spectrum. A subsequent collaboration with physicist Richard Friend and co-workers at Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory revealed the potential of these conjugated polymers for applications such as organic LEDs and rollable displays.
Friend and Holmes co-founded the company Cambridge Display Technologies for commercial exploitation of these materials – an early success story of Silicon Fen.
In 2004 Holmes returned to his native Australia on a Federation Fellowship, to lead a group at the newly established Bio21 Institute. He has pursued the application of photovoltaic polymers to solar energy, and was instrumental in forming the Victorian Organic Solar Cell Consortium. He has also continued to develop new syntheses of novel, biologically-useful materials. An example is his groups' synthesis of phosphoinositides, amphiphilic phospholipids situated in the cell membrane, which collaborators at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research have used to probe the dynamics of signal transduction (intercellular signaling being an important component of many aspects of cell biology, including that of tumors).
Holmes has served on the editorial or advisory boards of numerous learned scientific journals, including Organic Letters, Chemical Communications and Angewandte Chemie. In 2006, his 1998 paper on electroluminescent polymers was the most highly cited paper in Angewandte Chemie's 120-year history.
He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 2000, and Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in 2006. In 2003, he received the Descartes Prize and in 2012 the Royal Medal of the Royal Society. His formal titles include Chemistry alumnus, Laureate Professor of Chemistry, University of Melbourne; CSIRO Fellow, CSIRO Division of Materials Science and Engineering; Emeritus Professor and Distinguished Research Fellow, Imperial College London; Fellow of the Royal Society; Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science; Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering; and Foreign Secretary of the Australian Academy of Science. In 2004 he was appointed Member of the Order of Australia "For service to science through research and development, particularly in the fields of organic synthesis and polymer chemistry." By August 2012 he had authored over 490 scientific papers and 52 patent applications.
Holmes is a keen hillwalker and an enthusiastic aficionado of classical music, from baroque to romantic opera. During his time in Cambridge he was a member and regular volunteer at St. Columba's United Reformed Church. He lives in Melbourne and Lorne, Victoria with his wife Jennifer.

He is the author of "" (2012), "Canton Footprints: Sacramento’s Chinese Legacy" (2007), and "The Coming Man: 19th Century American Perceptions of the Chinese" (1994). Choy has been a community activist known for landmark preservation in San Francisco.
Background.
Choy was born in San Francisco on December 17, 1926. He grew up in San Francisco Chinatown and he was the fourth in an family of five children with three older sisters and a younger brother.
During high school, Choy enlisted in the Army Air Corps. He attended San Francisco City College during World War II until he was called to active duty for basic training in Biloxi, Mississippi. There, in the south, he decided to become an activist after witnessing first-hand the influence of segregation.
After the war, he earned a degree in architecture from UC Berkeley and was involved in residential and commercial design for 50 years. During the Civil Rights era of the 1960s, Choy became president of the Chinese Historical Society of America and in 1969, he teamed up with historian Him Mark Lai to teach the first-ever Chinese American history course at San Francisco State University in 1969.
Although retired from teaching, Choy is still an adjunct professor in the Asian American Studies Department at San Francisco State University. He has served on the San Francisco Landmark Advisory Board, on the California State Historical Resources Commission from June 2001 to June 2005, five times as President of the Chinese Historical Society of America (CHSA), and currently as an emeritus CHSA board member. He is also a recipient of the San Francisco State University President’s Medal in 2005, the Silver SPUR Awards in 2009, and the Oscar Lewis Award for Western History in 2011.
Choy has devoted his career to researching, preserving, advocating, and disseminating Chinese American history. Choy was the first to make a video documentary series on Chinese American history for public broadcasting called the “Gum Saan Haak” (Travelers to Gold Mountain, 1971-1974). He also publicly challenged the organizers of the 1969 Transcontinental Railroad Centennial at Promontory Point to acknowledge the Chinese railroad workers in the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad in the 1860s, thus reclaiming recognition for Chinese railroad workers whose contributions and sacrifices had been neglected for a century. In 1969, Choy as a guest speaker and historian spoke on the 100th Anniversary Celebration of the Transcontinental Railroad. He also advocated the preservation of the Angel Island Immigration Station and in 1993, he wrote the case study to nominate it to the National Register of Historic Places, because of its historical significance as a place where many Chinese immigrants were detained and it also offers a close look at important history lessons about the early Chinese pioneers.

Ticketmaster v. Tickets.com

Ticketmaster Corp., et al. v. Tickets.Com, Inc. was a 2000 case by the United States District Court for the Central District of California finding that deep linking did not violate the Copyright Act of 1976 because it did not involve direct copying. The decision permitted Tickets.com to place deep links to Ticketmaster.
Deep linking, hyperlinking to another website's interior pages, was the subject of considerable controversy in the late 1990s and early 2000s because it allowed consumers to bypass a website's advertising-rich homepage. This could lead to significant financial losses in advertising revenue based on page impressions. In early 1997, Ticketmaster filed a lawsuit against Microsoft for unauthorized deep linking to Ticketmaster in its Sidewalk.com website. In February 1999, the case was settled out of court in a non-disclosure agreement that led to Microsoft no longer having deep links to Ticketmaster. In July 1999, Ticketmaster filed a lawsuit against Tickets.com with ten causes of action, including charges that Tickets.com had violated federal copyright laws and violated Ticketmaster's terms and conditions.
In March 2000, ruling on Ticket.com's motion to dismiss U.S. District Judge Harry Lindley Hupp found that deep linking was not prohibited by the Copyright Act because no direct copying had occurred. In August 2000, Hupp denied Ticketmaster's motion for a preliminary injunction against Ticket.com's linking and web crawling. For linking, he wrote that uniform resource locators (URLs) were not copyrightable because they contained only factual and function features, and for web crawling, he wrote that it passed legal muster under the fair use doctrine and did not pose an undue burden on Ticketmaster's servers. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in a one-paragraph unpublished opinion.
Context.
There are two forms of linking: surface linking (which delivers the consumer to the linked website's homepage) and deep linking (which delivers the consumer to a non-homepage link of the website). Websites usually do not object to surface linking because it contributes to a growth in traffic and popularity, which leads to a monetary gain for advertising. Deep linking, on the other hand, has been a magnet for debate because it circumvents the advertising-rich homepage and may lead to lost revenue.
"Ticketmaster v. Microsoft".
Ticketmaster and Microsoft attempted to forge an agreement to allow Microsoft to have deep links to Ticketmaster. After the talks reached a stalemate and without permission from Ticketmaster, Microsoft used the deep links on its Sidewalk.com website, a Seattle city guide that provided details about future events in the area. Ticketmaster responded by banning incoming requests from the Microsoft links, and Microsoft countered the block by providing links to search engine queries that linked to Ticketmaster pages.
In early 1997, Ticketmaster sued Microsoft because its Sidewalk.com website was linking to pages on Ticketmaster about particular events. The lawsuit, Ashley Dunn wrote in "The New York Times", "sent a shiver of anxiety through the online world since it struck at one of the most basic aspects of the Web – the freedom and openness of the hypertext link". Calling Microsoft's deep linking "electronic piracy", Ticketmaster argued that the practice circumvented Ticketmaster's homepage, which had paid advertisements, and led to fewer homepage visits. This could negatively impact Ticketmaster's page impressions-based advertising income. Ticketmaster further asserted that it had contracts permitting other websites to deep link to Ticketmaster; Microsoft's unauthorized deep linking therefore rendered the contracts effectively valueless. In February 1999, Ticketmaster settled the deep linking lawsuit against Microsoft after Microsoft complied with the request to cease the linking. The details of the settlement were subjected to a non-disclosure agreement. After their settlement, Yahoo! and Knight-Ridder signed contracts with Ticketmaster and were given leave to make deep links to Ticketmaster. "The New York Times"s Bob Tedeschi noted in August 1997 that the Ticketmaster–Microsoft deep-linking case was "closely watched by legal experts because no court has yet ruled on whether deep linking is legal".
Background.
The legality of deep linking was the center of a fractious dispute among electronic commerce businesses. To compete for customers' consideration, a number of websites included hyperlinks to their competitors' pages, bringing users to inner pages of their opponents' websites. This practice circumvents the opponents' home page, which contains money-generating advertisements. In 2000, Ticketmaster had signed numerous "exclusive arguments" with a large number of the major athletic and amusement organizations. The ticket business began shifting to the internet, leading to competition between Ticketmaster and Tickets.com. Tickets.com allowed consumers to purchase tickets at their website. They had links to ticket-selling websites like Ticketmaster and Ticketweb to allow consumers to purchase tickets not sold on Tickets.com. Tickets.com included the statement "These tickets are sold by another ticketing company" before each link to a different ticket-selling website. Whereas Tickets.com generates revenue through web advertisements, Ticketmaster received money through Internet ticket selling and advertisements founded upon how many visitors accessed its homepage. Tickets.com employed a web crawler to systematically comb Ticketmaster's webpages and retrieve event details and uniform resource locators (URLs). After obtaining the facts, the web crawlers would destroy in 15 seconds the webpage copies but retain the URLs. The lawsuit, scholars Teresa Scassa and Michael Eugene Deturbide wrote, were motivated by how Ticket.com was becoming the "choice portal" for consumers buying tickets on the web by taking advantage of Ticketmaster's content.
Legal proceedings.
On July 23, 1999, Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch, a subsidiary of Pasadena-based Ticketmaster filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against Tickets.com in an attempt to block Tickets.com from disapproved deep linking to Ticketmaster, asserting that the practice caused them monetary losses on their homepage advertising. In the lawsuit, TicketsMaster alleged that Tickets.com had engaged in unlawful business choices. The litany of ten causes of action included charges that Tickets.com had breached federal copyright laws and engaged in false advertising, tortious interference, reverse passing off, unfair competition, and unfair business practices. It also said that Tickets.com violated the website's terms and conditions, which disallowed users from using Ticketmaster for monetary gain or unsanctioned deep linking. Ticketmaster charged in the complaint that when providing Ticketmaster phone numbers on Ticket.com, Ticket.com frequently gave invalid numbers—one time a phone sex number was listed—or the numbers of Ticketmaster's competitors.
TicketsMaster lawyer commented, "If we spend substantial money to build up a site, why should they be able to take that and build their business on the backs of our hard work?" Tickets.com's lawyer countered that deep linking is natural in a public Internet, "They have an open site and are a member of the free Internet community. They have to live by the rules of that community as it has grown up."
Ruling on motion to dismiss.
On March 27, 2000, U.S. District Judge Harry Lindley Hupp ruled on Ticket.com's motion to dismiss. He said that "deep linking by itself (i.e., without confusion of source)" does not necessarily involve unfair competition" under the following conditions: One, there is no confusion as to which website a consumer is accessing, and two, no pages are being duplicated by other websites. He said that "Hyperlinking does not itself involve a violation of the Copyright Act. There is no deception in what is happening. This is analogous to using a library's card index to get reference to particular items, albeit faster and more efficiently." Just as the library's card index enabled users to locate copyrighted books, the hyperlinks enabled users to locate copyrighted webpages.
The judge further ruled that Tickets.com was not legally obligated to abide by Ticketmaster's terms and conditions because they were not "open and obvious and in fact hard to miss". The terms and conditions were located at the homepage's bottom and viewers did not have to assent to them to access the website. Regarding the trespass to chattels claim, his decision noted that "it is hard to see how entering a publicly available Web site could be called a trespass, since all are invited to enter". Furthermore, Ticket.com's combing of Ticketmaster's databases was a trivial percentage of Ticketmaster's overall traffic, leading to an insignificant effect on the website's response time. Hupp found that possible negative effects of deep linking (the diminished advertising revenue) were equally matched by possible positive effects (the increased ticket sales from the referral of users wishing to purchase tickets from Tickets.com to Ticketmaster).
Ruling on motion for a preliminary injunction.
On August 10, 2000, Hupp issued a decision on Ticketmaster's motion for a preliminary injunction against linking and spidering. He ruled that the copyright violation claim was unfounded because "purely factual information", such as a public event's date, location, and cost, could not be copyrighted, regardless of the cost of time needed to aggregate the facts. He found that "the manner of expression and format of presenting those facts is protectable", and Tickets.com ensured to use their own expression and format to present the facts. Basing his reasoning on "Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. v. Connectix Corp.", Hupp wrote that Ticket.com's short-lived copies of Ticketmaster's webpages, which were used to obtain facts, was legal under the fair use doctrine of United States copyright law. He called the duplication a type of "reverse engineering to obtain non-protectable information". It passed legal muster under "Sony Computer Entertainment" because it was immediately removed after having served its purpose to retrieve non-copyrightable facts and was the ablest, albeit not sole, method to do so. He also found that URLs were not copyrightable because they consisted of "functional and factual elements".
In July 2001, Tickets.com ceased deep linking to Ticketmaster, instead focusing on its own ticket offerings. In their 2012 book "Ticket Masters: The Rise of the Concert Industry and How the Public Got Scalped", Dean Budnick and Josh Baron reported that "the court refused to grant a preliminary injunction on the copyright issue, and although the lawsuit lingered for a few years, Ticketmaster never received a definitive judicial pronouncement in its favor".
In a one-paragraph unpublished opinion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld Hupp's decision.
Commentary.
Approving of the ruling, Tickets.com's lawyer Danniel Harris said, "It is significant, not so much for the dismissals, but in the time and care put into the underlying issues." Author-attorney Jacqueline Klosek wrote that the "Ticketmaster" case provided strong evidence for how websites should avoid placing a link to their terms and conditions page at the bottom of the homepage if they wanted the terms and conditions to pass legal muster. She recommended that websites use a clickwrap agreement and if that proved problematic, websites ought to place a link to the terms and conditions page at a prominent location. "The Register"s Thomas C Greene speculated that the lawsuit was filed because there was no law mandating that consumers must view their advertisements. He said that "perhaps an Act of Congress is in order to rectify this glaring omission in the American legal system".
After the March 2000 ruling, Journalism.co.uk's Caroline White called the ruling a "seminal case over deep linking". "The Register"s Drew Cullen said it was a "definitive case", "establishing the legality of deep linking in the US". Lawyer Margaret Smith Kubiszyn disputed the media's general conclusion that the deep linking debate was settled, writing in May 2005 on GigaLaw: Although the news reports on the Ticketmaster v. Tickets.com case have enthusiastically proclaimed that the controversy is over, that deep linking is okay, Judge Hupp's ruling hardly lays forth a road map telling us when we can, and, more importantly, when we cannot, deep link. Clearly, Judge Hupp leaves open the possibility for a claim of copyright infringement and unfair competition in cases where the user could be confused as to the source of content or be oblivious to the fact that he had been linked into the interior of another site. "The New York Times"s Carl S. Kaplan agreed with Kubiszyn, writing that "the linking controversy continues" and quoting Jessica R. Friedman who said that "the law on linking is still in a gray area".

2012 NRL Grand Final

The 2012 NRL Grand Final was the conclusive and premiership-deciding game of the 2012 NRL season. Played on Sunday, 30 September at Sydney's ANZ Stadium between the minor premiers Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs and the second-placed Melbourne Storm.
Background.
This was the fourth time the Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs and Melbourne Storm have faced each other in a finals series and the first in a grand final. It was the fifth time in the past seven seasons the Melbourne Storm featured in a grand final, although they were playing for their second official title after their 2007 and 2009 titles were stripped due to salary cap infractions in 2010. The Bulldogs played in their first decider since 2004 when they defeated the Sydney Roosters to win their last premiership. It was also the third time coaches Craig Bellamy and Des Hasler oversaw their sides in a premiership decider after each claimed grand final success in their 2007 and 2008 meetings.
Melbourne and Canterbury have faced each other twice in the regular season, with the Storm beating the Bulldogs 12-6 in a tight match at Melbourne's home ground in AAMI Park in round 7 whilst the Bulldogs got over the Storm later in round 16 with a score of 20-4 at Canterbury's non-traditional venue at Virgin Australia Stadium in Mackay, Queensland.
Tickets to the grand final were sold out by 22 August, more than two weeks before finals playoffs begun. 
Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs.
The Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs finished first on the regular season competition ladder, claiming the 2012 minor premiership with 18 wins from 24 matches and finishing on 40 premiership points. This was the club's 7th minor premiership in its history and its first since 1994. The Bulldog's 2012 season was characterised by a 12-game winning streak from round 11 to round 24, which was eventually ended after a 34-6 defeat to the Canberra Raiders in round 25. This loss gave Melbourne a chance to claim the minor premiership, however a 42-10 win over the Sydney Roosters in round 26 ensured the Bulldogs finished first.
The Bulldogs began the 2012 finals series with a 16-10 win over the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles to ensure a preliminary final berth in week 3. They subsequently won this match 32-8 against the South Sydney Rabbitohs to qualify for the 2012 grand final against the Storm.
This was the Bulldogs 17th grand final appearance and the club's first since 2004.
Melbourne Storm.
The Melbourne Storm finished second on the regular season competition leader just behind the Bulldogs on 38 premiership points, with 17 wins from 24 games. The Storm's 2012 season was characterised by a 9-game winning streak from round 1 to round 9, making them early premiership favourites. The Storm subsequently suffered a 5-game losing streak from round 16 to round 21, allowing the Bulldogs to overtake them to win the minor premiership. Despite this, the Storm finished the season winning their last 5 consecutive matches to finish second.
The Storm began week 1 of the finals with a 24-6 victory over the South Sydney Rabbitohs to qualify for a preliminary final in week 3 against modern rivals the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. The Storm won this match 40-12 to qualify for the 2012 NRL Grand Final against the Bulldogs.
This was the Storm's fifth grand final appearance in seven seasons and its sixth appearance overall.
Match details.
Team lists.
Note: Kevin Proctor swapped with Sika Manu from his interchange spot before the match.
1st half.
The Storm began the first half with all the early possession, punishing a number of errors by the Bulldogs with several repeat sets. The relentless pressure was rewarded with a 7th minute try to Ryan Hoffman, bursting through a yawning gap after taking Gareth Widdop’s lovely short ball 10m out from the line to make it 4-0. Storm captain Cameron Smith missed the conversion. The Storm continued to pressure the Bulldogs’ try line over the next few minutes but they held strong, forcing the Storm to attempt a penalty conversion which was missed by Smith.
The Bulldogs took this as a sign of respect to their brutal defense and went on the attack, resulting in a 25th minute try to Sam Perrett, who beat Storm fullback Billy Slater to Krisnan Inu’s perfectly placed grubber kick. As Perrett dived over, Slater accidentally barged into him in his attempts to stop the try. Inu, reacting to what he thought was an illegal play by Slater, pushed the Storm fullback away, sparking an all in brawl which led to the one of the biggest controversies in Grand Final history. Once the fight was broken up, Slater claimed that he was bitten on the ear by Bulldogs prop James Graham. Video showed the fullback had blood coming from his ear and replays confirmed the allegations, clearly showing Graham biting Slater’s ear. Referee Tony Archer placed the incident on report and it was referred straight to the judiciary; Graham later received a 12 match ban. The try was awarded to Perrett, however, Inu missed the conversion and the score was locked at 4-4.
The Storm used the controversial incident to spur them on, relaying the pressure on the Bulldogs. They capitalized in the 32nd minute where Storm halfback Cooper Cronk delivering a sublime no look pass to Slater as he burst through a gap beating two defenders to cross for the Storm, taking the score out to 10-4 after Smith’s conversion. The Storm were not done just yet, as they delivered the knockout blow a minute before halftime where Cronk supplied a pinpoint cross field bomb to Justin O’Neil who leapt over Bulldogs fullback Ben Barba to score the Storm’s third try. Smith missed the conversion once more and the Storm led 14-4 at halftime.
2nd half.
The second half was a defensive slog. The Storm didn’t touch the ball in the opening 10 minutes, holding out set after set of the Bulldogs attack. Bulldogs captain Michael Ennis seemed to have scored in the 49th minute only to be denied by Cameron Smith holding him up. The Storm went down the other end and Smith missed another penalty conversion, failing in his attempts to make it a two converted try lead. The closest the Bulldogs came to scoring was in the 61st minute where Barba made a break down the left hand wing, kicked over the top to centre Josh Morris, who failed to capitalise due to the bounce of the ball and Slater’s desperate defending. Storm prop Brian Norrie appeared to have scored a try in the 70th minute, diving over after Slater batted back Cronk’s bomb, however it was to be denied as Norrie was offside. The Storm held on to win the Grand Final 14-4. Storm halfback Cooper Cronk was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal for his man of the match performance.
The crowd of 82,976 was the highest Grand Final attendance at ANZ Stadium ever since it was re-constructed in 2002 and it was the first Grand Final to have a scoreless half of play. The Storm’s 2012 triumph was their 2nd legitimate title. The result also saw Storm coach Craig Bellamy take home his first valid championship.
World Club Challenge.
The Melbourne Storm competed against the Super League XVII champions, Leeds Rhinos in the 2013 World Club Challenge, winning 18-14.

Skeptic's Toolbox

Held every August since 1992, the Skeptic's Toolbox was formed by psychologist and now-retired University of Oregon professor Ray Hyman. The workshop, held over four days, focuses on making people into better critical thinkers by investigating a central theme. The attendees are broken up into groups and given tasks that they must work on together and present in front of the entire group on the last day. The Skeptic's Toolbox is sponsored by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.
History.
Hyman created the Skeptic's Toolbox in 1989 to teach people how to be better skeptics. He tells James Underdown that "we were putting out more fires by skeptics than by believers... they were going overboard". The first toolbox was in Buffalo, NY with himself, James Alcock and Steve Shaw (now called Banachek). With the exception of one year when the toolbox was held in Boulder, Colorado, the toolbox has been held at the University of Oregon in Eugene.
In general, the faculty likes to keep the numbers at about 90 in order to give everyone personalized attention, and allow everyone the chance to participate. At the 1993 Toolbox, "More than a hundred people participated, from 19 states, Canada, and Hong Kong, and their enthusiasm continued to grow with each passing day, ending on the fifth day with what appeared to be a unanimous 'If only we had more time!'".
In 1997 "Skeptical Inquirer Magazine" announced that CFI would begin offering an academic certificate for students in a three-year program. Students needed to complete 30 units in academic work as well as in workshops. The two certificates offered were "Humanistic Studies" and "Science and the Paranormal", attending The Skeptic's Toolbox would satisfy one of the workshop requirements.
Methodology and focus.
While critical thinking is the overall focus, lectures designed around the theme focus on the specialties of the faculty. A reporter for the "Register-Guard" attended the 2003 toolbox and wrote of his experience hearing lectures on post traumatic stress syndrome, graphology, repressed memory court cases, communication with the dead, healing through prayer, traditional Chinese medicine and psychic dogs. All that and Jerry Andrus's display of optical illusions too. The goal of the Toolbox is to "help skeptics add to their arsenal of tools and techniques with which to both guard against deception and properly evaluate paranormal claims". Learning how to communicate with believers is also considered important: "Skeptics search for truths, believers tend to want validation of their experiences".
Getting the skeptical message across to believers was a focus at the 1993 event. Faculty felt that non-skeptics might be more receptive if attendees understood how they were perceived by others. "Many people view skeptics as die-hard cynics and debunkers, even as enemies of free speech. Nonskeptics often hear only the "COP" in CSICOP".
In 2010, interviewed by D. J. Grothe, Hyman explained, "give people the tools to think, help them to become better thinkers". Mentalist Bob Fellows performed at the second conference and told the audience, "The effect (of a magic trick) on audiences who (believe the trick is real magic) can be enormously powerful. And when deceit is involved, they can be potentially harmful as well". Hyman felt that it was necessary to teach attendees with a "case-based approach... concrete examples as a first step toward extracting broad examples... (giving) the benefit of context" to the learning experience.
Faculty of the Toolbox.
Loren Pankratz - A founding faculty member of the Skeptic's Toolbox, Pankratz explained to Harriet Hall, about the beginnings of the Toolbox, "Ray Hyman, Jerry Andrus and I were meeting together once a month or so and we decided that maybe the three of us could put a Toolbox together."
Barry Beyerstein - "One of the many enjoyable tasks I undertake for CSICOP is to lecture in Ray Hyman's annual summer workshop at the University of Oregon. Not only is it the towering presence of Ray himself, and the joy of observing the sheer brainpower of my fellow faculty at work, it is also the people, literally from around the world, who enroll in this and other CSICOP functions that keep me from suffering that occupational hazard 'skeptic's burnout.' They are a remarkable lot, genuinely nice people committed to critical thinking and leaving the place a bit better than they found it. They make me very pleased that my fate was to become a skeptical inquirer."
Harriet Hall - Prior to attending the Toolbox as a student, Hall had been a "passive skeptic", "I hadn't done any writing... Ray Hyman and Wally Sampson encouraged me to try my hand at writing, one thing led to another and now I'm on the faculty of the Skeptic's Toolbox."
Lindsay Beyerstein - She started attending the Skeptic's Toolbox when she was 14; her father Barry Beyerstein strongly influenced her involvement in the skeptical movement. "It's sorta funny, the skeptics' movement is now finally old enough, it's like Scientology, we have second gen!" She recounts, "I was always involved with my Dad in skeptical meetings... "We would have family newsletter-stuffing nights (for the BC Skeptics)." instead of hiring babysitters her father would take Lindsay to his media interviews. "Does Satanic music cause suicide? Out-of-body experiences... it was always something new and different."
James Alcock - "Ray and I and a magician by the name of Steve Shaw, now known as Banachek did the very first Toolbox in Buffalo... a little while later Ray asked me if I could come out here to this group." Ray stated "It took a long while to get Jim out here, but finally we managed it."

Loren Pankratz

Loren Pankratz (born February 27, 1940) was a psychologist at the Portland VA Medical Center and professor in the department of psychiatry at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). Following his retirement in 1995, he maintained a forensic practice until 2012. He testified across the nation on multiple cases of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, often defending mothers falsely accused of harming their children.
He has written and lectured on a wide variety of unusual topics such as dancing manias, spiritualism, Greek oracles, ghosts, plagues, historical enigmas, mesmerism, moral panics, con-games, self-deception, faith healing, self-surgery, miracles, ethical blunders, quackery, and renaissance science. He has also published magic history, magic tricks, and mentalism effects in magic trade journals. Pankratz, along with Ray Hyman and Jerry Andrus, was a founding faculty member of the Skeptic's Toolbox in Eugene, Oregon. Pankratz is also a Fellow for the Committee of Skeptical Inquiry.
Personal.
Pankratz received his B.A. from Oregon State University in 1962 and his Ph.D. from the University of Oregon in 1968. He is a lifelong resident of Oregon, and his mother and grandparents were pioneers near Mount Hood.
His wife, Ethelyn, was the administrator of the Providence Center for Medically Fragile Children; they have four children.
Pankratz has an extensive personal library on the history of deception and mistaken ideas. In 2012, Pankratz constructed a display of historically significant books about quackery at the Oregon Health & Science University Library.
In 1970, Pankratz signed an organ donor card. There are reasons to believe this may be the earliest donor card ever completed, and it is now held in the historical archives of the OHSU library.
Career.
In 1971, Pankratz opened a new psychiatry ward at the Portland VA Medical Center. Pankratz was also responsible for psychiatry admissions, which gave him experience with emergency room physicians and procedures. In these settings, he became aware of the array of false information that patients presented to clinicians. "Summering in Oregon" was the first of his extensive publications on patient deception.
In 1975, Pankratz became consultation psychologist for medical and surgical services where he remained until his early retirement in 1995. He lectured on patient deception at grand rounds in nearly every hospital specialty. "The purpose of checking a veteran's story, of course, is not directed at catching lies but at identifying and treating the proper problem."
Pankratz was appointed professor in the psychiatry department at Oregon Health Sciences University (now Oregon Health & Science University) in 1989. In an undoubtedly unique position for a psychologist, Pankratz was appointed chair of the promotion and tenure committee of the department of psychiatry. He held that position for eight years, selected by two psychiatry department chairmen. After retirement, now clinical professor, he became part of the teaching faculty of the forensic fellowship program in the department of psychiatry.
As a reviewer for the "American Journal of Psychiatry", Pankratz vetted potential publications on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in which some authors "merely gathered evidence for what they believed was true about symptoms and the underlying trauma." Careful studies show that patients can sincerely report events and symptoms that are significantly discrepant from underlying facts. Moreover, both children and adults, it turns out, are amazingly resilient in the long run to trauma. The label of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Pankratz's opinion, should be reserved for those with a significant psychiatric condition based on an abnormal response to a documented trauma. He discovered that many aspiring authors did not check outside facts, and patients told therapists what they wanted to hear.
In 1984, Pankratz and two colleagues founded the Drug-Seeking Behavior Committee which turned the focus of drug abuse from addiction to the earlier problem of risk. This work pioneered attention to what is now recognized as a serious health problem. His article was the first to define "drug seeking behavior" and recommend management strategies.
In 1993, Pankratz was appointed to the scientific and professional advisory board of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation. He has written about the lack of documented evidence for repressed memory and the resistance in acknowledging this professional blunder.
Munchausen syndrome by proxy.
Pankratz's articles on Munchausen syndrome by proxy were among the first to identify the problem of false accusations associated with the diagnosis. Early in his forensic career, Pankratz was surprised to discover mothers accused of Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MBP) merely because they were advocating for their children with developmental disorders. In most cases Pankratz concluded that "mothers who present the problems of their children in ways perceived as unusual or problematic have become entangled in legal battles that should have been resolved clinically". In the majority of cases he reviewed, the mothers "were well meaning but inappropriately concerned about the health of their children, or their behavior was problematic in other ways". In an interview with "Psychology Today" Pankratz stated "I have seen mothers accused of MBP simply because physicians disagreed about the medical management of their child..." it is "vastly overdiagnosed."
After a highly contentious case in Pennsylvania, Pankratz told the "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette" that the accused mother was not creating medical symptoms in her children. Often called in as expert testimony, Pankratz stated, "for 30 years... (I have) been hired by prosecutors, defense attorneys, insurance companies and the Roman Catholic Church as an expert in medical deception." In his opinion, the mother had not created medical symptoms in her children. Instead, the symptoms were caused by a mitochondrial disorder, an uncommon condition that is difficult to diagnose. The children were returned to the care of the mother. 
Selected publications.
Pankratz published "Patients Who Deceive" in 1998 which is part of the Charles Thomas Behavioral Science and Law series. Reviewer Phillip Resnick wrote that Pankratz clearly explains the difference between a malingerer (someone who wants to appear sick) and a person with factitious disorder who wants to be sick (even when no one is watching). Resnick states that the book showcases "many dramatic examples of creating illusions of illness."
Pankratz and psychiatrist Landy Sparr wrote the first paper describing factitious Posttraumatic Stress Disorder after it appeared in the psychiatric diagnostic manual. They showed that the stories of trauma always require external verification, a perpetual theme in the writings of Pankratz.
Pankratz showed that forced-choice testing was a new strategy for the assessment of malingering related to any sensory deficit. These papers and the one on memory testing have all been cited over 100 times.
A couple of years later Pankratz expanded forced-choice testing to assess malingering on neuropsychological assessment. From this seminal work, a flood of tests have incorporated his conceptual strategy.
In "Journal of the American Medical Association" (JAMA), Pankratz published an article on the assessment and treatment of "geezers". The "Los Angeles Times", in a review of the article, says geezers, "are never more misunderstood than when, laid low by medical problems they can't shake themselves, they are forced to swallow their pride and go to the doctor." The Times goes on to quote the article, "'So all the medical profession can do is wait for the geezer to appear, on his own time and his own terms. If eccentric older men can be approached with interest, understanding and respect, half the battle is won--and the war may be avoided.'"

Christine Love (visual novelist)

Christine Love is a Canadian independent visual novelist best known for her three original works: ', "Don't take it personally, babe, it just ain't your story", and '. Love began creating visual novels while in university, making a few small games, visual novels, and pieces of written fiction before coming into prominence with the release of "Digital" in 2010. She went on to work on "Love and Order", a dating simulation by video game designer Riva Celso, as well as "Don't take it personally", both released in 2011. Her latest work and first commercial project on which she was the primary developer is "Analogue", released in February 2012; Love dropped out of her English degree during its development, and is currently fully supported financially on the proceeds. She released an expansion to the game, titled "Hate Plus" in 2013. Her current project is called "Ladykiller in a Bind", and is expected to be released in 2015.
Biography.
Christine Love began creating visual novels while in school at Trent University. By January 2010, she had made a few small video games, written a novel and a few short stories, which she largely unsuccessfully tried to sell, and had made a visual novel each March for three consecutive years. In February 2010, she started a fourth visual novel, which resulted in "", her first game to receive widespread attention and acclaim. Set "five minutes into the future of 1988", "Digital" tells the story of the silent protagonist's online relationship with a girl named *Emilia, and a mystery surrounding the "murders" of several AI programs. The game is presented entirely through the interface of a 1980s computer with online bulletin board system posts and messages from other characters; the protagonist's own messages are implied but never shown. Love expected the game to reach as many people as her prior work, "a dozen or so people"; instead, the free game was noticed by video game publications and websites such as "PC Gamer" and Gamasutra and received much more attention, becoming what Love believes was "a defining point in writing career". Widely praised by critics, Gamasutra named "Digital" as a runner-up in their "Best Indie Games of 2010" list. Love felt that "Digital"s success turned her from a writer into an indie game developer.
After "Digital", Love worked on her first commercial game project, "Love and Order", a dating simulation by video game designer Riva Celso. She did writing and design work for the game, set in the Crown attorney's office in Montreal, which was released in February 2011. Love describes the game as "not really my best work", as dating simulations are not her strong point. Nevertheless, proceeds from the game were enough to support her financially for a while, and showed Love that creating games and visual novels could be a full-time profession. In 2011, she spent the month of March working on another visual novel: "don't take it personally, babe, it just ain't your story", which was released as a free download on 4 April 2011. A spiritual sequel to "Digital", the game follows John Rook, a private school literary teacher in 2027, over the course of a semester. He can see students' private messages at any time via the school's social network. "Don't take it personally" deals with themes of internet privacy and relationships in the future. The game was again widely praised by critics, with "The Daily Telegraph" awarding the game for "Best Script" in its video game awards of 2011.
That summer, Love began working on a larger, commercial game. She was beginning to believe that her games could be successful commercially, a belief supported by messages to that effect by fans of her previous works. The game, "", was released in February 2012. Love dropped out of university during the game's development in her fourth year of an English undergraduate degree. She felt that she was "not really learning a whole lot" and was unable to balance school and work on the game. Set centuries after "Digital: A Love Story", the plot of "Analogue" revolves around an unnamed investigator, who is tasked with discovering the reason for an interstellar ship's disappearance once it reappears 600 years after "going dark". The game's themes focus similarly around human/computer interaction, interpersonal relationships, and LGBT issues; but focus primarily on "transhumanism, traditional marriage, loneliness and cosplay." The release of "Analogue", Love's first commercial game as main developer, currently fully supports her financially. Although "Analogue" is a sequel "of sorts" to "Digital", the time difference between the two games means that they are connected more in spirit than directly, similar to the connections between "Digital" and "Don't take it personally". "Analogue" sold over 30,000 copies by August 2012, and has inspired the release of a soundtrack album by the game's composer, Isaac Schankler, as well as a commercial expansion to the game, titled "Hate Plus", which is intended to further develop the backstory of *Mute and the ship.
Since the release of "Hate Plus", Love has begun work on a new game, titled "Ladykiller in a Bind". The full name of the game is "My Twin Brother Made Me Crossdress As Him And Now I Have To Deal With A Geeky Stalker And A Domme Beauty Who Want Me In A Bind!!", and the game is described by Love as "an erotic visual novel about social manipulation and girls tying up other girls".
Influences and philosophy.
Christine Love describes herself as "a writer first, and a game designer second", as writing was her initial goal. She originally pictured her future as that of a novelist, with a day job as a programmer to support herself. Love describes her games as being about "our relationship with technology, about human relationships in general, and about seeing things from different perspectives," as well as having "a ton of words". She strives for her stories to be true and sincere, but not necessarily realistic. Love is also interested in the portrayal of gender and sexuality in video games; in "Digital" and "Analogue", she was careful to avoid mentioning or assuming the gender of the player or the character they control, though the love interests in the games are female. Privately, however, she thinks of them as female, as her intention was to create games that could be easily appreciated by queer people such as herself, without having to project themselves onto a relationship that did not match up to their perceptions. Love believes that indie games have "more meaningful depictions of queer experiences" than those from larger studios.
Love's design process has become more refined as time goes on. For "Digital", she did not plan anything in advance; while for "Analogue", she worked out the entire design and pacing game in flowcharts before starting. For all of her games, however, she does a lot of research into the time periods and issues involved. Love does not feel that text is necessarily the best way to tell a story in a game, but finds it easier to communicate with it as a writer.

Auto polo

Automobile polo or Auto polo was a motorsport invented in the United States with rules and equipment similar to equestrian polo but using automobiles instead of horses. The sport was popular at fairs, exhibitions and sports venues across the United States and several areas in Europe from 1911 until the late 1920s; but it was dangerous and carried the risk of injury and death to the participants and spectators.
Origins.
The official inventor of auto polo is purported to be Ralph "Pappy" Hankinson, a Ford automobile dealer from Topeka who devised the sport as a publicity stunt in 1911 to sell Model T cars. The reported "first" game of auto polo occurred in an alfalfa field in Wichita on July 20, 1912 using four cars and eight players (dubbed the "Red Devils" and the "Gray Ghosts") and was witnessed by 5,000 people. While Hankinson is credited with the first widely publicized match and early promotion of the sport, the concept of auto polo is older and was proposed as early as 1902 by Joshua Crane, Jr. of the Dedham Polo Club in Boston, with the "Patterson Daily Press" noting at the time of Crane's exhibition that the sport was "not likely to become very popular." Auto polo was also first played in New York City inside a regimental armory building in 1908 or 1909. The popularity of the sport increased after its debut in July 1912, with multiple auto polo leagues founded across the country under the guidance of the Auto Polo Association. The first large-scale exhibition of auto polo in the eastern United States was held on November 22, 1912 at League Stadium in Washington, D.C. By the 1920s, New York City and Chicago were the principal cities for auto polo in the United States with auto polo matches occurring every night of the week. In New York, matches were held at Madison Square Garden and Coney Island.
Internationally, auto polo was regarded with skepticism and caution. In 1912, the British motoring publication "The Auto" described the new sport as "very impressive" and a "lunatic game" that the writers hoped would not become popular in Britain. Hankinson himself promoted auto polo in Manila in the 1910s with events sponsored by Texaco and recruited teams in the United Kingdom. Auto polo was further spread to Europe by auto polo teams from Wichita that toured Europe in the summer of 1913 to promote the sport. In Toronto in 1913, auto polo became the first motorsport to be showcased at the Canadian National Exhibition, but the sport did not become popular in Canada.
Rules and equipment.
Unlike equestrian polo which requires large, open fields that can accommodate up to eight horses at a time, auto polo could be played in smaller, covered arenas during wintertime, a factor that greatly increased its popularity in the northern United States. The game was typically played on a field or open area that was a least long and wide with wide goals positioned at each end of the field. The game was played in two halves (chukkars) and each team had two cars and four men in play on the field at a given time. The first auto polo cars used by the Dedham Polo Club were unmodified, light steam-powered Mobile Runabouts that seated only one person and cost $650 (equivalent to $ today). As the sport progressed, auto polo cars resembled stripped down Model Ts and usually did not have tops, doors or windshields, with later incarnations sometimes outfitted with primitive rollbars to protect the occupants. Cars typically had a seat-belted driver and a malletman that held on to the side of the car and would attempt to hit a regulation-sized basketball toward the goal of the opposing team with the cars reaching a top speed of and while making hairpin turns. The mallets were shaped like croquet mallets but had a three-pound head to prevent "backfire" when striking the ball at high speeds.
Safety and damage concerns.
Due to the nature of the sport, cars would often collide with each other and become entangled, with malletmen frequently thrown from the cars. Installation of rollcages over the radiator and rear platforms of the cars helped prevent injuries to players, but falls did result in severe cuts and sometimes broken bones if players were run over by the cars, though deaths due to auto polo were rare. Most of the cars would usually be severely wrecked or demolished by the time the match was finished, leaving most players uninsurable for costly material and bodily damages incurred during the game. A tally of the damages encountered by Hankinson's British and American auto polo teams in 1924 revealed 1564 broken wheels, 538 burst tires, 66 broken axles, 10 cracked engines and six cars completely destroyed during the course of the year. The sport waned in popularity during the late 1920s, mostly due to the high cost of replacing vehicles, but did have a brief resurgence in the Midwestern United States after World War II.
Moto polo.
A recent variant of auto polo played with motorcycles, called "moto polo", was developed in Rwanda in 2008 by Sam and James Dargan. The game is played in 15-minute quarters with five players per team using mallets to hit a ball made of banana leaves. The sport has few definite rules beyond "motorcyclists cannot use their feet to kick the ball and players cannot stick objects into motorcycle wheels".

Wilhelmina Weber Furlong

Wilhelmina Weber Furlong (1878-1962) was a German American artist and teacher.
Among America's earliest avant-garde elite modernist painters, Weber Furlong was a major American artist who pioneered modern impressionistic and modern expressionistic still life painting at the turn of the twentieth century’s American modernist movement.
She has been called the first female modernist painter in the early American Modernism scene, and she represents the struggles of many women artists in the late 1800s and early 1900s as they became subjugated to the many realists who opposed the American modernist movement and serious women artists.
Biography.
Beginning in 1892 her teachers included Emil Carlsen, William Merritt Chase, and Edmund H. Wuerpel. She was present at the Salon d'Automne or Autumn Salon for three years and she knew Pablo Picasso, Paul Cézanne, and others who exhibited at the Paris Salon. In the American modernism movement she painted between 1892 and 1962 where she thrived during the modernist movement in St. Louis, New York, and Paris from 1897 to 1906. She painted in Mexico City from 1906 to 1913 and again in New York City from 1913 to 1947. She was also active during the formative years of the modernist movement in New York City and the popular 1913 Manhattan studio gallery of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong was highlighted in her biography. She also painted in Bolton Landing, New York from 1921 to 1960 at her Modern Art Colony, Golden Heart Farm and simultaneously in Glens Falls, New York from 1952 to 1962.
In America her significant circle of friends and acquaintances includes John Graham,
Willem de Kooning, David Smith, Dorothy Dehner, Jean Charlot, Edward Hopper, Alexander Calder, Rockwell and Sally Kent, Thomas Hart Benton, Allen Tucker, Max Weber, Kimon Nicolaidies, and many others. As a student, she was associated with the Art Students League as a young woman prior to 1900 and in 1913 began a serious role in the New York art scene at the Art Students League as a Secretary Treasurer and member of the Board of Control along with her husband, the artist Thomas Furlong. She taught art for over 56 years in New York and she was active with the Whitney Studio Club during the formative years of the organization in New York City.
Legacy and Honors.
Weber Furlongs' close association in Bolton Landing, New York with the sculptor David Smith has had a lasting influence on the hamlet to this very day and she is known to be responsible for bringing him to the farm he purchased there with his wife sculptor and painter Dorothy Dehner. Weber Furlong's works are on permanent display at the Bolton Landing Museum.
The Hyde Collection in Glens Falls, New York has displayed the works of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong since 1966 where they hosted a major solo retrospective of the artist work after her death in 1962. The Tang Museum at Skidmore College holds a work by Weber Furlong which has been exhibited regionally since 1952. In the early 1950s Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York held solo exhibitions of the works of Weber Furlong for several years and she exhibited alongside the artist David Smith at the State Capital in Albany New York. The Ft. Edward Art Center hosted a solo exhibition in May 1994. Starting in late September 2012 through early April 2013, The International Woman's Foundation in Marfa, Texas held a major retrospective of the works of Weber Furlong featuring over 75 unseen works and private belongings of the artist including her Victorian easel. The one woman show was held at the Iconic Building 98 studio galleries along with a one hour lecture by Professor Emeritus James K. Kettlewell retired curator of the Hyde Collection.
In Spring of 2012, Wilhelmina Weber Furlong became the subject of a documentary film based on the biography on the life of the popular early American woman modernist. Permanent displays of the work of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong are at the Hyde Collection in Glens Falls, New York and the Bolton Landing, New York town history museum.
On August 7, 2012 the Crandall Public Library in Glens Falls, New York hosted a documentary film crew and lecture on Wilhelmina Weber Furlong featuring James K. Kettlewell, Professor Emeritus Skidmore College and retired curator of the Hyde Collection where they displayed one of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong's lost works.
On July 23, 2013 the City Glens Falls, New York Common Council approved a resolution to place a New York State historical marker in downtown Glens Falls near City Hall. The resolution stated: "Weber Furlong (1878 – 1962) One of America's great and influential artists of the twentieth century, Weber Furlong was among the first to champion the Modern art movement. The final years of her life were spent in Glens Falls, where she lived and taught near this site at her Ridge Street studio until her death in 1962. "Placed for the Warren County Bicentennial"."

Affine-regular polygon

In geometry, an affine-regular polygon or affinely regular polygon is a polygon that is related to a regular polygon by an affine transformation. Affine transformations include translations, uniform and non-uniform scaling, reflections, rotations, shears, and other similarities and some, but not all linear maps.
All triangles are affine-regular. In other words, all triangles can be generated by applying affine transformations to an equilateral triangle. A quadrilateral is affine-regular if and only if it is a parallelogram, which includes rectangles and rhombuses as well as squares. In fact, affine-regular polygons may be considered a natural generalization of parallelograms.
Many properties of regular polygons are invariant under affine transformations, and affine-regular polygons share the same properties. For instance,
an affine-regular quadrilateral can be equidissected into formula_1 equal-area triangles if and only if formula_1 is even, by affine invariance of equidissection and Monsky's theorem on equidissections of squares. More generally an formula_3-gon with formula_4 may be equidissected into formula_1 equal-area triangles if and only if formula_1 is a multiple of formula_3.

16th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement

The 16th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement was held from 26 to 31 August 2012 in Tehran, Iran. The summit was attended by leaders of 120 countries, including 24 presidents, 3 kings, 8 prime ministers and 50 foreign ministers.
The summit's framework was the "Final Document" adopted during the Ministerial Meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement Coordinating Bureau which was held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt from 7 to 10 May. The Foreign Ministry also said that the agenda would primarily consist of issues pertaining to nuclear disarmament, human rights and regional issues. Iran also intended to draw up a new peace resolution aiming to resolve the Syrian civil war.
The summit consisted of two preceding events: a "Senior Officials Meeting" on 26 and 27 August 2012, and a "Ministerial Meeting" on 28 and 29 August 2012. The leaders summit took place on 30 and 31 August. Egyptian President, Mohammad Morsi, officially handed the presidency of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, during the inaugural ceremony of Leaders' Meeting. Iran will hold the NAM presidency for three years until the 17th summit in Venezuela in 2015.
Overview.
As of August 2012, the organisation consists of 120 member states, including the non-UN member state of Palestine, and 21 other observer countries. The countries of the Non-Aligned Movement represent nearly two-thirds of the United Nations' members and contain 55% of the world's population.
Since the Non-Aligned Movement was formed in an attempt not to take sides during the Cold War, it has sought to seek a new direction since the fall of the Soviet Union. After the breakup of Yugoslavia, a founding member, its membership was suspended in 1992 at the regular ministerial meeting held in New York during the regular annual session of the United Nations General Assembly.
Organization.
The summit was scheduled to be held at Kish Island but it was transferred to Tehran in 2010. According to Vice President Ali Saeedlou, who is the head of the organising committee, up to 7,000 participants – including delegations and the media – are expected to attend the summit. To prepare for the meeting and reduce traffic and air pollution, a five-day public holiday in Tehran has been called for the duration of the summit. Parts of Tehran have been beautified with lamp posts and freshly painted road markings. Roads around the summit venue will be closed to all but official vehicles. Iran's deputy police chief Ahmad Reza Radan stated "The police are on full alert during the Non-Aligned Movement summit." In addition, to raise security of the event, visa-free entry to Iran normally offered to nationals from several countries has been temporarily suspended.
The "Senior Officials Meeting" and "Ministerial Meeting" convened at the "IRIB International Conference Center" (IICC). The summit was held at "Tehran's Summit Conference Hall".
Participants.
A spokesman of the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that 24 presidents, 3 kings, 8 vice presidents, 8 prime ministers, 50 foreign ministers attended at the summit. By the first day of the summit, 110 delegations arrived Tehran.
Ali Akbar Salehi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iran, announced that UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon would attend the conference. He also invited leaders of Russia, Turkey and Brazil to the summit. Mohamed Morsi, ex-president of NAM and the Egyptian President, also announced that he would participate in the summit. He was the first leader of his country to visit Iran since the Islamic revolution.
Iran reportedly cancelled an invitation to Saudi Arabia to attend the summit. However, it was later announced that Abdulaziz bin Abdullah, Saudi Deputy Foreign Minister, would participate in the summit upon the invitation of Saudi Arabia.
Pre-summit responses.
Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad commented on the significance of the summit in Iran: "Certain NAM states too have upheld sanctions against Iran which is a totally unwise move because the sanctions are not on part of the UN, rather unilaterally levelled by the US The U.S. can issue any sort of sanctions it wants against Iran but there is no reason other countries to follow suit."
According to the Indonesia's ambassador to Iran, the summit will be "important and timely" under the current regional and international circumstances. He stressed: "During the Tehran summit, efforts should be made so that the path of developments stemming from the Islamic Awakening in the region will continue in a right way and not diverted to violence and conflict."
An Iranian government official also commented on the summit, reportedly saying that "the NAM summit is the best opportunity to confront the sanctions." He added that "in meetings with the officials of member states, we should brief them on the illegality of these sanctions and talk to them to make these sanctions ineffective."
Agenda.
The base of the summit's negotiations' framework is the "Final Document" adopted during the Ministerial Meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement Coordinating Bureau which was held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt from 7 to 10 May 2012.
The Foreign Ministry also said that the agenda would primarily consist of issues pertaining to nuclear disarmament, human rights and regional issues. Iran also intended to draw up a new peace resolution aiming to resolve the Syrian civil war. During the summit, Iran will draw up a new peace resolution aiming to resolve the Syrian crisis.
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi opened the first meeting and spoke of NAM's original goal: "We believe that the timetable for ultimate removal of nuclear weapons by 2025, which was proposed by NAM, will only be realised if we follow it up decisively." At the opening of the ministerial meeting Khamenei said: "The UN Security Council has an irrational, unjust and utterly undemocratic structure, and this is an overt dictatorship. The control room of the world (the Security Council) is under the control of the dictatorship of some Western countries." Al Jazeera interpreted Moon's reaction as "nonplussed."
Senior Officials Meeting.
The Senior Officials Meeting was held on 26 and 27 August 2012. The officials reviewed the Sharm el-Sheikh's document and issued a draft document which should be endorsed by the ministerial meetings. Iran's deputy foreign minister, Mohammad Mehdi Akhondzadeh, who is also secretary general of the senior officials meeting, read parts of the draft document at the press conference and mentioned some of the main points including rejection of all forms of terrorism, as well as all form of occupation including occupation of the Palestinian territories by Israel, requesting weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapon disarmament, condemning unilateral sanctions and replacing unipolar management of international politics with collective management. According to Akhundzadeh, the draft urges for a Middle East free from nuclear weapons and emphasizes "inalienable" right of all NAM member states for the peaceful use of nuclear energy, envisaged by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
Ministerial Meeting.
The Ministerial Meeting with presence of foreign ministers of NAM countries was held on 28 and 29 August 2012. Egypt's Deputy Foreign Minister, Ramzy Ezzeldin Ramzy, handed the presidency of the ministerial meeting for three years at the opening ceremony of the meeting. After opening remark of Ali Akbar Salehi and listening to the report of Senior Officials Meeting which was delivered by Mohammad Mehdi Akhondzadeh, the ministers starts to review the document. After preparation of the final document for the leaders' summit, Ali Akbar Salehi participated in a press conference and emphasized on the four main topics that were discussed at the meeting including establishment a task force in New York to pursue Palestine's membership in the United Nations and act against Israel's "illegal" measures against Palestinians, finding solution for Syrian crisis with United Nations cooperation, acting against monopolizing of the financial mechanisms in the world by using US dollar and finally establishment of a work group in New York to study the mechanisms of plural management of the world .
Leaders' Summit.
On 30 August, the summit was inaugurated by Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Then the Egyptian President, Mohammad Morsi, as the chair of the 15th summit declared opening of the 16th summit and presented the report of NAM's chairmanship during the past three years. Morsi officially handed the presidency of the Non-Aligned Movement to the Iranian President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. After Morsi, President of the Sixty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon, Chair of the Group of 77 Mourad Benmehidi, host President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh delivered their opening speeches. Khamenei later commented that "the Non-Aligned Movement definitely has more political right than the US, NATO or some European countries to intervene in the Syrian issue," but “did not elaborate on what kind of role the group should have.”
Inaugurating the summit, Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei condemned the use of nuclear and chemical weapons as an "unforgivable sin", and called for "Middle East Free from Nuclear Weapons". Khamenei argued that it was ironic for the US to oppose nuclear proliferation while, according to Khamenei, it possessed the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons and had used them in the past. He also accused the US and its Western allies of providing "the usurper Zionist regime" with nuclear weapons. A day after U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon asked Khamenei to lower his rhetoric on Israel, Khamanei accused "the Zionist regime" of "waging disastrous wars" and "oganizing state terror" throughout the world, and said the media that it and the West own repeat the "lie" that the Palestinians are "terrorists." He criticized the UN Security Council as "unjust" and "undemocratic" and accused the US of abusing it. Other Iranian officials stated that the Security Council had more power than the General Assembly and criticized the veto rights of its permanent members. Khamenei accused the United States of protecting the interests of the Western countries in the name of "human rights", interfering militarily in other countries in the name of "democracy", and targeting civilians in the name of "combating terrorism." Khamenei also proposed improving the "political productivity" of the Non-Aligned Movement in global governance and called for a "historic document", an active secretariat, and administrative tools to achieve this. He also called for economic cooperation and for cultural relationships between NAM members.
Following Khamenei's remarks, the United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, who was described as visibly irritated, denounced Iran's position towards Israel in his opening speech. "I strongly reject threats by any member state to destroy another or outrageous attempts to deny historical facts, such as the Holocaust," he said. "Claiming that another UN Member State, Israel, does not have the right to exist, or describing it in racist terms, is not only utterly wrong but undermines the very principles we have all pledged to uphold." While describing Iran's cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency as "constructive and useful," Ban Ki-Moon demanded that Iran boost global confidence in its nuclear program by "fully complying with the relevant (UN) Security Council resolutions and thoroughly cooperating with the IAEA." Ahmadinejad also declares a one minute of silence in honor of the late Iranian president and prime minister, Mohammad-Ali Rajai and Mohammad-Javad Bahonar that were assassinated in same day in 1981.
Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi denounced the Syrian government, an ally of Iran, calling it "oppressive" and said that it was an "ethical duty" to support the Syrian revolt against the Bashar al-Assad government. Walid al-Moallem, Syrian foreign minister, walked out in protest, although Mahmoud Ahmadinejad remained seated beside Morsi. Morsi called for a peaceful transition to freedom and democracy in Syria. Like Iran, Morsi also called for reform in the structure of the UN Security Council. Morsi echoed Iranian calls for a nuclear-free Middle East, and criticized Israel for refusing to join the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Morsi and Iran also both supported the Palestinian bid for a seat at the UN. At the summit Egypt's Mohammed Morsi also handed over the leadership of the body to Iran for the next three years.
Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, called for a peaceful resolution of the crisis in Syria and pledged support for the Palestinian movement. He also called for reform in the UN Security Council, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The summit also drew up a draft resolution on ending the Syrian conflict.
The summit's final declaration ratified on 31 August by the 120 members of NAM, emphasizes on the right of all countries to develop and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and notably singles out Iran. In addition, it condemns unilateral sanctions, supports creation of a Palestinian state, advocates nuclear disarmament, human rights free from political agendas and opposition to racism and "Islamophobia". But due to lack of consensus among member states it did not mention to Syria's civil war.
At the end of the summit, Venezuela was declared as the host of the 17th summit with the consensus of the member states.
Bilateral meetings.
Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh are likely to meet on the margins of the summit to discuss recent developments in India–Pakistan relations and in the region. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon intends to talk with the Iranian leaders about issues such as Iran's nuclear programme, terrorism, human rights and the crisis in Syria.
India, Iran and Afghanistan agreed to set up a joint working group to discuss the development of the strategically important Chahbahar port in Iran.
Iran's President Ahmadinejad and his Egyptian counterpart, Mohamed Morsi, described Iran and Egypt as "strategic allies".
At two separate meetings with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, spokesman Martin Nesirky said that United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon called for a stop to their threats against Israel, and said that "their verbal attacks on Israel were offensive, inflammatory, and unacceptable." Ban also said that Iran needed to take "concrete steps to address the concerns of the International Atomic Energy Agency and prove to the world its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes." He further urged Iran to use its influence to help end the Syrian Civil War. Human rights were also discussed.
In addition, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon criticised Iran for alleged "serious concerns on the human rights abuses and violationand urged Iran to cooperate with the United Nations to improve its human rights record. Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani, who sat next to Ban, was reported by "Ynet" as having frowned at the remarks. He also met Syria's PM Wael al-Halaqi and Foreign Minister Walid Muallem and later told a news conference about the meeting that in regards to the violence "the primary responsibility resting on the government to halt its use of heavy weapons. [He demands for all sides to cease all forms of violence. What is important at this time is that all the parties must stop the violence. All those actors who may be providing arms to both sides...must stop." He further mentioned that he had called on Iran to support his call "and I have a strong assurance from Iran that it will do so." He also met the new UN-Arab League envoy Lakhdar Brahimi.
Reactions and assessments.
"AFP" claimed that Ban Ki-Moon's attacks on Iran and Morsi's support for the Syrian opposition upset Iran's goal of showing the summit as a diplomatic victory for Iran against Western attempts to isolate Iran. A Xinhua commentary qualified the summit as an "important" diplomatic "accomplishment from Iran", having hosted "leaders and delegates of over 100 countries". The Anti-Defamation League slammed what they called the hate speech of Ayatollah Khamanei's opening remarks, in which he rejected Israel's legitimacy, accused "ferocious Zionist wolves" of committing daily acts of murder around the world, and perpetuated an old anti-Semitic myth of a "Zionist-controlled" media.
Other events.
In an effort for Iran to prove that its nuclear programme is peaceful, the Foreign Ministry of Iran declared that Iran would arrange for officials from the Non-Aligned Movement to visit its nuclear facilities. In addition, the mangled remains of three cars in which Iranian nuclear scientists were assassinated stands outside of the event venue, as part of an Iranian campaign to demonstrate that Iran has been a victim of terrorism, which Iran has accused the West as being responsible for.
The Cultural Heritage, Handcrafts and Tourism Organization announced an opportunity for visiting delegations to make a visit to the exhibition of Persian handicrafts held at Tehran's Milad Tower. Visiting nationals from the NAM countries could avail of a tour of Tehran's historic museums, palaces and ancient sites in order to get acquainted with Persian culture and civilisation.
Controversies.
Attendance of Ban Ki-Moon.
While it is usual for the UN Secretary General to attend NAM Summits, the presence of Ban Ki-Moon was opposed by the United States and Israel. "Haaretz" reported that Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu had personally appealed to the secretary-general not to attend this summit and described Iran as "a regime that represents the greatest danger to world peace". In addition, according to "Maariv", the Israeli Foreign Ministry ordered Israel's embassies to encourage their host countries not to attend or to send only lower-level representatives to the summit.
The government of the United States also publicly expressed displeasure over world leaders attending the summit. U.S. State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland said: "We think that this is a strange place and an inappropriate place for this meeting. We have made that point to participating countries. We've also made that point to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. If he does choose to go, we hope he will make the strongest points of concern." "Haaretz" reported that both the United States and Israel believed that such a visit would break their efforts to isolate Iran from the international community by giving the country a "renewed international legitimacy."
Although the US and Israel had urged Ban to boycott the summit, UN spokesman Martin Nesirky confirmed that Ban would attend the summit. He hoped to meet with Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei and President Mahmoud Ahmadenijad at the sidelines of the summit to have "meaningful and fruitful discussions" and to "convey the international community's expectations that Iran make urgent progress on issues including the country's controversial nuclear program, terrorism, human rights and the crisis in Syria."
Still, Ban Ki-Moon signalled that he would not refrain from criticizing Iran at the summit. At the summit, harsh criticism of Iran's human rights record was levelled by Ban, which caught Iranian officials off guard.
After speaking at the Leaders' Summit, Ban was labelled "a servile puppet of American imperialism" and was reported to be engaging "in a disgraceful diplomatic offensive" during the summit Ban criticised Iran in calling the country to "…demonstrate that it can play a moderate and constructive role internationally, includes responsible action on the nuclear program" and "for the sake of peace and security in this region and globally, [urged Iran to take the necessary measures to build international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme."
Iranian opposition groups urged Ban Ki-Moon to use his attendance at the summit as a way to criticize the Iranian government over its crackdowns on political dissent, such as the house arrest of opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mahdi Karroubi.
Fatah–Hamas rivalry.
In late August, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad invited Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh to the summit, despite Fatah leader Mahmoud Abbas' attendance being contingent on Abbas serving as the sole representative of the Palestinians at the summit, Haniyeh's office said that he would attend the summit, sparking a counter-protest. Fatah's Prime Minister Salam Fayyad condemned the invitation, accused Iran of being "against Palestinian national unity" and said that only his party's representatives were the "sole and legitimate representative" of the Palestinians. Their Foreign Affairs Minister Riyad al-Maliki said that if Haniyeh attends the conference Abbas would not attend and reiterated the stance that it was the only "legitimate Palestinian representative." The Palestine Liberation Organization also condemned the invitation, saying that "Iran joined the Israeli choir which aims to undermine the Palestinian political system and its elected legitimacies."
However, on 26 August, news agencies "Mehr" and "ISNA" said that it had not invited Haniyeh. Mohammad Reza Forqani, the spokesman for the summit, said: "Only President Mahmoud Abbas has been invited to the NAM summit."
On the other hand, on 26 August, a source close to Hamas declared "After intense consultations in the last few hours, a decision was taken not to attend the NAM summit that will take place in Tehran at the end of this month." Taher al-Nono, a Hamas spokesman, appropriating Ahmadinejad told this invitation shows Iran's support of Palestine but Haniyeh excused and refrain for attendance in the summit to not intensify disagreements and divides of Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims.
Error in translations.
Iranian state media has been heavily criticized for distorting part of Egyptian President Morsi's speech at the summit.
On 30 August 2012, during the summit, some Iranian media outlets reported that official Iranian stations were deceiving Iranians by tampering with the Persian translation of Egyptian President Morsi's speech, in order to fit the Iranian government's rhetoric – namely, opposing criticism of the Assad government in Syria, an ally of Iran. Iranian official state television refused to translate part of Morsi's speech which criticized Syria. One outlet reported that the Iranian interpreter translated part of Morsi's speech which criticized Assad as in fact supporting Assad, saying that "we must support the ruling regime in Syria." In another case, when Morsi denounced the Syrian government as "tyrannical", the Iranian translator quoted Morsi as saying that "there's a crisis in Syria and all of us must support the Syrian ruling system."
Jahan News and Asiran, as well as other Iranian outlets, published the tampered speech, and deliberately highlighted parts of Morsi's speech without referring to Morsi's stance on Syria. In other cases, the Iranian translator exchanged the word Syria with Bahrain when discussing countries that have been affected by the Arab Spring, as well as "Islamic Awakening" instead of "Arab Spring." Iranian media activist Ameed Maqdam Maqdam reported that this could not have happened unless the translator received orders from Iranian higher authorities, aiming to deceive Iranian public opinion.
In addition, Iranian media confirmed changes to speeches delivered by United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and United Nations General Assembly President Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser and apologies to the people.
As a result, Bahrain criticized the Iranian media for distorting Morsi's speech, and for replacing "Syria" with "Bahrain."

Gilman, Clinton and Springfield Railroad

The Gilman, Clinton and Springfield Railroad was a railroad of 111 miles in length, chartered in 1867, that operated from 1871 until 1877 in the U.S. state of Illinois. It provided service from Springfield, the state capital, to Gilman, a junction point on the main line of the much larger Illinois Central Railroad. After operation for a short period as an independent short line, the Gilman, Clinton and Springfield underwent financial failure and was merged into the Chicago and Springfield Railroad, an affiliate of the Illinois Central. 
History.
The late 1860s and early 1870s, the period immediately following the American Civil War, was a boom time in the construction of American steam railroads, with investment capital abundant and rails laid to a large number of rural towns and counties that had not previously enjoyed service. 
The Gilman, Clinton and Springfield was an example of this phenomenon. Its backers were aware of a triangular, underserved slice of Illinois agricultural land in east-central Illinois; farmers had to haul their crops many miles to the nearest siding, either west to the Chicago and Alton or east to the Illinois Central. By building a competing railroad line through Mount Pulaski, Clinton, Farmer City, and Gibson City, the new railroad could serve this slice of rural Illinois. In particular, the new railroad became the prime provider of railroad service to much of strongly agricultural DeWitt County. 
The new railroad acquired a charter in 1867 and began grading, leveling and planning the roadbed in 1870. The new railroad ran its first train in October 1871. Soon afterwards, however, the Long Depression of the mid-1870s caused a sharp slowdown in economic activity throughout the United States, and the new railroad defaulted on the debt it had sold to build its main line; it was forced by a court in December 1873 to enter receivership. 
Litigation showed that the young railroad's financial status had been doomed by Gilded Age conduct that approached, or crossed the line, into deliberate looting. The fledgling rail line's board of directors had borrowed $4.0 million and hired a contractor, the "Morgan Improvement Company", to build the line. The Morgan Improvement Company paid $1.5 million to build the line, leaving $2.5 million in profits for itself of which a substantial share was paid, apparently in bribes, to the members of the Gilman line's board of directors. It should be noted that the Morgan Improvement Company was a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad. 
Aftermath.
The failure of the Gilman, Clinton and Springfield indirectly sparked litigation that included a case heard by the United States Supreme Court, Hinckley v. Gilman Clinton and Springfield Railroad, 94 U.S. 467 (1876); the foreclosure of the railroad led to a legal dispute between the railroad's successor-in-interest and a court-appointed receiver. 
Meanwhile, the right-of-way built for the Gilman, Clinton and Springfield became a separately-incorporated branch line, called the "Chicago and Springfield", of the more financially stable Illinois Central (IC). The branch line operated as such from 1877 until shortly after 1899, when the IC acquired a second segment of railroad line, a former chunk of the St. Louis, Peoria and Northern Railway, thereby allowing the former Gilman line to become part of a second main line from Chicago to St. Louis. The "Chicago and Springfield" charter served no further purpose, and was wound up in 1902. 
Illinois Route 54 almost exactly parallels the route of the former Gilman, Clinton and Springfield; in some places, the state highway is only feet away from the rail right-of-way, now a part of the Canadian National. Passenger train service ceased in 1971.

Lucius Cornelius Lentulus Cruscellio

Lucius Cornelius Lentulus (probably Lucius Cornelius Lentulus Cruscellio) (fl. 1st century BC) was a suffect consul in 38 BC, at the end of the Roman Republic.
Biography.
A member of the Patrician gens Cornelia, Cruscellio was the son of Lucius Cornelius Lentulus Crus. From September 20 through to October 23, 54 BC, he was the prosecutor who brought charges under the "Lex Cornelia de maiestate" against Aulus Gabinius, the ex-consul of 58 BC.
In 44 BC, he was possibly elected to the office of Praetor, and he was one of those who declared that the Senate’s allotment of provinces for the following year (during the meeting of November 28, 44 BC) was not binding.
Probably as a result of his father’s support for Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus during the civil war, Cruscellio was proscribed by the ruling "triumvirs". Therefore in 42 BC, he fled to Sextus Pompey in Sicily. Sextus gave him a naval command as a Legatus, probably a "legatus pro praetore". Probably after the Pact of Misenum in 39 BC, Cruscellio became reconciled to the triumvirs, and became a supporter of Marcus Antonius. As a result, he was appointed suffect consul in 38 BC, replacing Appius Claudius Pulcher.
Cruscellio was married to Sulpicia, and may have been the father of Lucius Cornelius Lentulus, who was consul in 3 BC.

W238BJ (95.5 FM) is a commercial radio translator licensed to Auburn, Ohio providing limited coverage to northern parts of Greater Cincinnati. Owned by EMF Broadcasting, Inc., W238BJ formerly simulcast the alternative rock format heard on WEBN-HD2 under the callsign W292DT at 106.3 FM.
History.
W238BJ began on September 24, 2004. On April 24, 2009, the translator adopted the callsign W292DT. Although FM translators in the U.S. are generally not permitted to originate their own programming, the Federal Communications Commission has recently allowed FM translators to simulcast the programming of both AM stations and HD2 digital subchannels. In effect, this allows radio companies to create additional analog stations, like W292DT, outside the traditional path established by the FCC. W292DT is such a station. Prior to August 2012, W292DT carried content from the K-LOVE radio network. On August 16, 2012, translators W292DT and W264BW began simulcasting the alternative rock format on WEBN-HD2 as "The Project 100.7 / 106.3". On March 20, 2013, the translator re-adopted the callsign W238BJ. As of January 2014, the translator broadcasts over 95.5 MHz.

<doc id="36803584" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36803584" title="Cyclone Sina">
Cyclone Sina

Severe Tropical Cyclone Sina was the only named tropical cyclone to develop within the South Pacific basin during the 1990-91 season. The system was first noted as a shallow depression within the South Pacific Convergence Zone to the west of Wallis Island. Over the next three days the system moved towards the west-northwest, before it was named Sina during November 24, after it had developed into a tropical cyclone. Over the next couple of days the system intensified further and developed an eye feature as it erratically moved towards Fiji. Sina subsequently peaked in intensity during November 26, before the system passed through the Fijian Islands over the next two days as it started to gradually weaken. Sina subsequently passed just to the north of Tongatapu in Tonga during November 29, before it passed about 160 km (100 mi) to the south of Niue and near the Southern Cook Islands during the next day. The system subsequently rapidly weakened and became an extratropical cyclone during December 1, before they were absorbed by an advancing trough of low pressure near 50°S on December 4.
The cyclone caused no deaths and over in damages, as it affected Fiji, Tonga, Niue and the Southern Cook Islands. Ahead of the system affecting Fiji, hundreds of people were evacuated from Fiji's outer island resorts to hotels on the mainland. High winds and heavy rain forced the closure of several local airports and the main Nadi International Airport. As Sina moved through the archipelago, the system destroyed or damaged houses and other building structures, while bringing down electric and telephone lines and uprooting trees. The system also washed away a railway bridge on Vanua Levu that was used to take sugar cane to Labasa's mills, leaving growers no choice but to go through the village of Korowiri. However, the workers refused to go into their fields unless they had police protection to go through the village, after Methodists from the local church attacked a group of growers for working on Sundays in defiance of Fiji's Sunday Observance Decree. Within Tonga only minor damage to weak structures, trees, banana plantations, electric and telephone lines was recorded. Within both Niue and the Southern Cook Islands only minor damage to crops and structures was reported.
Meteorological history.
On November 20, the Fiji Meteorological Service's Nadi tropical cyclone warning center (TCWC Nadi) started to monitor a shallow tropical depression that had developed within the South Pacific Convergence Zone to the west of Wallis Island. Over the next two days the system moved towards the west-northwest and the Fijian dependency of Rotuma, before the depression's chances of developing further became good during November 23, as upper outflow over the system became established. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) subsequently initiated advisories and classified the depression as Tropical Cyclone 03P at 1200 UTC the next day, after atmospheric convection surrounding the system organized further. Later that day at 19:10 UTC, TCWC Nadi named the system Sina after the depression had developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, while it was located about to the northwest of Rotuma. During November 25, the cyclone continued to intensify and developed an eye as it moved erratically towards the west-southwest and performed a small clockwise loop. Early on November 26, TCWC Nadi reported that Sina had become a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. At around this time the JTWC reported that Sina had become equivalent to a category one hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS).
During that day, Sina's eye became very distinct on satellite imagery. As the system intensified and came under the influence of a changeable upper level steering flow which resulted in Sina moving erratically towards the southeast and Fiji. Later that day TCWC Nadi reported that the system had peaked as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone, with 10-minute sustained windspeeds of . The JTWC subsequently reported early the next day that Sina had peaked with 1-minute sustained windspeeds of , which made it equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on the SSHWS. During that day, Sina remained at its peak intensity as it moved towards the east-southeast and started to be observed on the Nadi radar. Later that day, as the system started to gradually weaken, it passed about to the south of Viti Levu before it passed over the island groups of Vatulele and Moala and the Southern Lau Islands during November 28. During that day the system moved across the 180th meridian, which prompted the JTWC issue their final warning on Sina and pass the responsibility for warning the United States Government to the Naval Western Oceanography Center.
Early on November 29, Sina weakened into a category two tropical cyclone on the Australian scale just before it passed to the north of Tongatapu in Tonga. During that day, as the system moved eastwards towards the Southern Cook Islands and gradually weakened further, the NWOC issued their final advisory on Sina while estimating that it was equivalent to a category one hurricane on the SSHWS. Early on November 30, the system passed about to the south of Niue, before it recurved sharply towards the south-southeast later that day as it approached the Southern Cook Islands. The system subsequently started to rapidly weaken under the influence of strong vertical wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures. TCWC Nadi subsequently passed the primary warning responsibility for Sina to TCWC Wellington as it crossed 25°S, who quickly reported that the system had lost its tropical characteristics and had become an extratropical depression. Over the next couple of days Sina's extratropical remnants maintained a south-eastward track, before it was absorbed by an advancing trough of low pressure near 50°S on December 4.
Preparations, impact and aftermath.
Cyclone Sina affected Fiji, Tonga, Niue and the Southern Cook Islands and was responsible for damages totaling over . The system had initially appeared to threaten the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu as it performed a small clockwise loop and moved erratically towards the west-southwest during November 25. After this usage of the name, Sina was retired from the tropical cyclone naming lists.
Fiji.
Late on November 25, TCWC Nadi issued a tropical cyclone alert for Fiji, while the system was located about to the northwest of the country. During the next day, a gale force wind warning was issued for the western half of Viti Levu, the Yasawa and Mamanuca island groups, which was later upgraded to a storm warning while a gale warning was also issued for the rest of Viti Levu. These storm warnings were briefly dropped early on November 27, when the storm appeared to be moving away from the country, but as Sina came within range of the Nadi radar, it became apparent that southern Fiji would be directly hit by the system. As a result, hurricane warnings were issued for Vatulele, Kadavu and smaller nearby islands, while storm warnings were re-issued for the western half of Viti Levu and the Mamanuca island group. Over the next day as the cyclone approached, hurricane, storm and gale warnings were revised to cover various islands within the Koro and Southern Lau island groups, before all warnings were cancelled on November 28, as Sina moved away from Fiji.
Ahead of Sina affecting the Fijian islands, from November 27 until November 29, with wind gusts of up to , hundreds of people were evacuated from Fiji's outer island resorts to hotels on the mainland. As the cyclone affected Fiji high winds and heavy rain forced the closure of several local airports and the Nadi International Airport for around 20 hours. As the cyclone moved towards the east-southeast between November 27–28, it passed near to or over the south-western coast of Viti Levu, Vatulele, Bequa, Northern Kadavu and various islands within the Moala and Southern Lau island groups and caused some coastal erosion. As it moved through the archipelago, the system destroyed or damaged houses and other building structures, while bringing down electric and telephone lines and uprooting trees. The system also severely affected crops and vegetation including sugar cane and pine forests, however the extent of the damage was limited by the fact that many of the crops had already been harvested.
On December 7, the Australian Government via the international development bureau and Air Pacific provided emergency shelter materials, including tarpaulins, plastic sheeting and rope, after an appeal for international assistance was made by the Fijian government. After the cyclone damaged resorts were quickly repaired, while the Fijian government launched an international advertisement campaign for the islands with discounted airfares. Overall Sina caused over () worth of damage to the Fijian islands, with most of the damage accounted for by losses to agriculture, sugar cane, and pine forests. After Cyclone Sina had washed away a railway bridge on Vanua Levu that was used to take sugar cane to Labasa's mills, growers had no choice but to go through the village of Korowiri. However, the workers refused to go into their fields unless they had police protection to go through the village, after Methodists from the local church attacked a group of growers for working on Sundays in defiance of Fiji's Sunday Observance Decree. As a result sugar cane that had been damaged by Sina was left rotting in Fiji's fields until the Fiji Sugar Corporation ordered that a temporary bridge be built to bypass the village.
Tonga.
Late on November 27, as Sina affected the Fijian island of Viti Levu, TCWC Nadi issued a tropical cyclone alert for the Tongatapu, Haʻapai and Vavaʻu groups of islands. During the next day the tropical cyclone alert for Vavaʻu was cancelled, while a gale force wind warning was issued for Haʻapai and a storm force wind warning was issued for the Tongatapu islands. The system subsequently moved in between the Tongatapu and Haʻapai groups of islands where sustained windspeeds of up to and wind gusts of up to were recorded at the Nukuʻalofa weather station. Parts of the Tongan capital city Nuku'alofa were left without power, after electric lines were brought down, while several homes were partially damaged after the roofs lost their iron. Overall only minor damage to weak structures, trees, banana plantations, electric and telephone lines was recorded within the island nation.
Other island nations.
During November 29, TCWC Nadi issued strong wind warnings for Niue as the island experienced marginal gale force winds from the system, as it passed about to the south of the island. High seas salt spray and waves caused some damage to crops and the island's wharf. They also washed away two temporary roads that were installed after Cyclone Ofa had affected the island earlier in the year.
Early on November 30, as the system moved towards the east-southeast, TCWC Nadi issued a gale warning for the Cook Islands of Rarotonga and Mangaia, while issuing strong wind warnings and tropical cyclone alerts for the rest of the Southern Islands. The warnings were subsequently maintained until later that day, as Sina spared the Cook Islands its major effects and re-curved sharply towards the south-southeast. Only minor damage to shallow rooted crops and weak structures was reported, after high seas and gale force winds buffeted the northern side of Rarotonga.

Consumed scrubfowl

The consumed scrubfowl ("Megapodius alimentum") is an extinct megapode that was native to Fiji and Tonga in the south-west Pacific Ocean. It was originally described from subfossil remains collected by David Steadman from an archaeological site on the island of Lifuka in the Haʻapai group of the Kingdom of Tonga. The specific epithet and vernacular name refer to its evident use as a food item. Subsequently remains were also found on Lakeba and Mago in the Lau group of Fiji by Trevor Worthy. It is likely that it became extinct through overhunting following human settlement of the islands.

Morwell Advertiser

The Morwell Advertiser was a weekly newspaper published from 1886 until 1972 in Morwell, Victoria, Australia. It was initially published on Saturdays, however it changed to Fridays from 1890 until the 1930s when it changed to Thursdays.
Name changes.
The paper started as the Morwell Advocate & Boolara & Mirboo Chronicle and then became the Morwell Advertiser & Weekly Chronicle from 1887 to 1888. In 1888 it became the Morwell Advertiser. It continued as the Morwell Advertiser until 1967 when it briefly became the Latrobe Valley Advocate before reverting to Morwell Advertiser in 1969.
History.
The first issue of the Morwell Advocate & Boolara & Mirboo Chronicle, published Saturday 30 October 1886, outlined the purpose of the paper on the front page which stated
"It is the intention of the Proprietors to seize every opportunity of advancing the interests of Morwell and the surrounding district. Every effort will likewise be made to obtain the latest and most reliable information for the public. Full reports will be given of all shire councils and other important meetings which from time to time will be held within the large district where the Morwell Advocate circulates. The latest markets will be duly recorded from week to week; while those of its readers who are of a sporting turn of mind will find much within its columns that will be of interest to them. While special attention will be paid to local maters, those of a political nature will not be lost sight of. In short it is intended to make the Advocate all that a journal should be." 
George Watson (1874-1942) was the editor and proprietor of the Morwell Advertiser from 1894 until his death in 1942. He was only 20 years old when he purchased the paper and was at the time the youngest Newspaper publisher in Victoria. Watson was a prominent figure in Morwell, being involved in practically every public activity including starting the initial tennis club, president of Gippsland Bowling Association for 15 years, Past Master of the Morwell Masonic and Marc Lodges, and a Justice of the Peace amongst other activities. He was also one of the founders of the Victorian Provincial Press Association in 1910.
In 1916 George Watson purchased The Morwell & Yinnar Gazette newspaper and it became incorporated with the Morwell Advertiser. 
The paper was briefly sold to Mr H. T. Hipwell, who also owned the Gippslander in Mirboo Shire, in 1927. However, it was sold back to George Watson in 1928.
In 1967 the Morwell Advertiser and the Moe Advocate merged to form the Latrobe Valley Advocate & Advertiser. However, in 1968 the Elliott Newspaper Group bought the Latrobe Valley Advocate & Advertiser and reinstated them as separate bi-weekly papers from 3 March 1969.
Meanwhile, during the 1960s a free regional newspaper was established in the Latrobe Valley called the Latrobe Valley Express. Its first issue was published 18 June 1965 and the first regular issue was published on 14 July. By the late 1960s the Latrobe Valley Express had “severely dented the business of the paid newspapers in the region. They could not compete in circulation or penetration.” The Elliott Newspaper Group therefore had to decide how to respond to this challenge. It was suggested that they should start an opposition free paper, however they decided instead to buy out the Latrobe Valley Express. The Elliott Group was the majority partner with KS Hopkins and Sons Pty Ltd, who published the Warragul gazette. The deal became official on 9 February 1970.
However, as neither the Latrobe Valley Express nor the paid papers owned by the Elliott Newspaper Group (Moe Advocate, Morwell Advertiser and Traralgon Journal) were doing well it was decided to shut down the Moe Advocate and the Morwell Advertiser. The Morwell Advertiser ceased on 27 April 1972.

NML Cygni

NML Cygni or V1489 Cygni is a red hypergiant star and one of the largest stars currently known with a radius about 1,650 times the Sun's, equal to 7.67 astronomical units. Its distance from Earth is estimated to be around 1.6 kpc, or about 5,300 light-years.
NML Cygni is a part of the Cygnus OB2 association, one of the closest massive associations to the Sun spanning nearly 2° on the sky, or ∼30 pc in radius at the distance of 1.74 ± 0.2 kpc.
Characteristics.
The diameter of NML Cygni, at 1,650 times that of the sun, is about . If placed at the center of the Solar System, its surface would extend beyond the orbit of Jupiter, filling over half the gap between Jupiter and Saturn's orbit. It contains a volume approximately 4.5 billion times that of the Sun. The bolometric luminosity (Lbol) for this star is near 3 × 105 L☉. Its bolometric magnitude (Mbol) is around −9.0. It is one of the most luminous cool hypergiant stars. It is also a semiregular variable star with a period of around 940 days.
This star is evolved and a number of heavy elements and molecules have been detected in its atmosphere, particularly oxygen, hydroxyl, and water. It has a dusty environment surrounding it, and it exhibits a bean-shaped asymmetric nebula that is coincident with the distribution of its H2O vapor masers.
NML Cygni has an estimated mass loss rate of 2×10−4 M☉ per year, one of the highest known for any star. The annual parallax of this star is measured to be around 0.62 milli-arc-seconds. From the observations, it is estimated that this star has two discrete optically thick envelopes of dust and molecules. The optical depth of the inner shell is found to be 1.9, while that of the outer one is 0.33. These dust envelopes are formed due to the strong post-main sequence wind velocity, 23 km/s, and the high mass loss.
Because of its position on the outskirts of the massive Cygnus OB2 association, the detectable effects of NML Cygni's radiation on the surrounding dust and gas are limited to the region away from the central hot stars of the association.
Observational history.
NML Cygni was discovered in 1965, by Neugebauer, Martz, and Leighton which described two extremely red luminous stars, their colour being described as consistent with a black body temperature of 1,000K. The name NML comes from the names of these three discoverers. The second star was briefly referred to as NML Tauri but is now known as IK Tauri, an M9 Mira variable. NML Cygni has since also been given the designation V1489 Cygni on account of the small semi-regular brightness variations, but is still most commonly referred to as NML Cygni.
Its composition began to be revealed with the discovery of OH masers (1612 MHz) in 1968. The presence of molecules like , , , , , , , and was also revealed in the later years.

Jovan Vladimir

Jovan Vladimir or John Vladimir (; ca. 990 – 22 May 1016) was the ruler of Duklja, the most powerful Serbian principality of the time, from around 1000 to 1016. He ruled during the protracted war between the Byzantine Empire and the First Bulgarian Empire. Vladimir was acknowledged as a pious, just, and peaceful ruler. He is recognized as a martyr and saint, with his feast day being celebrated on 22 May.
Jovan Vladimir had a close relationship with Byzantium but this did not save Duklja from the expansionist Tsar Samuel of Bulgaria, who conquered the principality in around 1010 and took Vladimir prisoner. A medieval chronicle asserts that Samuel's daughter, Theodora Kosara, fell in love with Vladimir and begged her father for his hand. The tsar allowed the marriage and returned Duklja to Vladimir, who ruled as his vassal. Vladimir took no part in his father-in-law's war efforts. The warfare culminated with Tsar Samuel's defeat by the Byzantines in 1014 and death soon after. In 1016, Vladimir fell victim to a plot by Ivan Vladislav, the last ruler of the First Bulgarian Empire. He was beheaded in front of a church in Prespa, the empire's capital, and was buried there. He was soon recognized as a martyr and saint. His widow, Kosara, reburied him in the "Prečista Krajinska" Church, near his court in southeastern Duklja. In 1381, his remains were preserved in the Church of St Jovan Vladimir near Elbasan, and since 1995 they have been kept in the Orthodox cathedral of Tirana, Albania. The saint's remains are considered Christian relics, and attract many believers, especially on his feast day, when the relics are taken to the church near Elbasan for a celebration.
The cross Vladimir held when he was beheaded is also regarded as a relic. Traditionally under the care of the Andrović family from the village of Velji Mikulići in southeastern Montenegro, the cross is only shown to believers on the Feast of Pentecost, when it is carried in a procession to the summit of Mount Rumija. Jovan Vladimir is regarded as the first Serbian saint and the patron saint of the town of Bar in Montenegro. His earliest, lost hagiography was probably written sometime between 1075 and 1089; a shortened version, written in Latin, is preserved in the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja. His hagiographies in Greek and Church Slavonic were first published, respectively, in 1690 and 1802. The saint is classically depicted in icons as a monarch wearing a crown and regal clothes, with a cross in his right hand and his own head in his left hand. He is fabled to have carried his severed head to his place of burial.
Life.
Duklja was an early medieval Serbian principality whose borders coincided for the most part with those of present-day Montenegro. The state rose greatly in power after the disintegration of Serbia that followed the death of its ruler, Prince Časlav, in approximately 943. Though the extent of Časlav's Serbia is uncertain, it is known that it included Raška (now part of Central Serbia) and Bosnia. Raška had subsequently come under Duklja's political dominance, along with the neighboring Serbian principalities of Travunia and Zachlumia (in present-day Herzegovina and south Dalmatia). Byzantines often referred to Duklja as Serbia.
Around 1000, Vladimir, still a boy, succeeded his father Petrislav as the ruler of Duklja. Petrislav is regarded as the earliest ruler of Duklja whose existence can be confirmed by primary historical sources, which also indicate that he was in close relations with Byzantium. The principality consisted of two provinces: Zenta in the south and Podgoria in the north. A local tradition has it that Vladimir's court was situated on the hillock called Kraljič, at the village of Koštanjica near Lake Skadar, in the Krajina region of southeastern Montenegro. Near Kraljič lie the ruins of the "Prečista Krajinska" Church (dedicated to Theotokos), which already existed in Vladimir's time. According to Daniele Farlati, 18th-century ecclesiastical historian, the court and residence of Serbian rulers once stood in Krajina.
Vladimir's reign is recounted in Chapter 36 of the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, completed between 1299 and 1301; Chapters 34 and 35 deal with his father and uncles. These three chapters of the chronicle are most likely based on a lost biography of Vladimir written in Duklja sometime between 1075 and 1089. Both the chronicle and the 11th-century Byzantine historian John Skylitzes described Vladimir as a wise, pious, just, and peaceful ruler.
Vladimir's reign coincided with a protracted war between the Byzantine Emperor Basil II (r. 976–1025) and the ruler of the First Bulgarian Empire, Tsar Samuel (r. 980–1014). Basil II might have sought the support of other Balkan rulers for his fight against Samuel, and he intensified diplomatic contacts with Duklja for this purpose. A Serbian diplomatic mission, most likely sent from Duklja, arrived in the Byzantine capital of Constantinople in 992 and was recorded in a charter of the Great Lavra Monastery, written in 993.
In 1004 or 1005, Emperor Basil recovered from Samuel the city of Dyrrhachium, the major stronghold on the Adriatic coast, south of Duklja. Since 1005, Basil had also controlled the coastal lands north and south of that city, parts of the Byzantine Theme of Dyrrhachium. Byzantium thus established a territorial contact with Prince Vladimir's Duklja, which was in turn connected to the Byzantine Theme of Dalmatia, consisting of Adriatic towns northwest of Duklja. The Republic of Venice, an ally of Byzantium, militarily intervened in Dalmatia in 1000 to protect the towns from attacks by Croats and Narentines. Venetian rule over Dalmatia on behalf of Basil was confirmed by the emperor in 1004 or 1005. Svetislav Surinja, a Venetian ally, was crowned Croatian king. Venice, the Dalmatian towns, Croatia, and Vladimir's Duklja, were thus aligned in a compact pro-Byzantine bloc connected to Byzantium via Dyrrhachium.
The close relations with Byzantium, however, did not help Prince Vladimir. Samuel attacked Duklja in 1009 or 1010, as part of his campaign aimed at breaking up that pro-Byzantine bloc, which could pose a threat to him. Vladimir retreated with his army and many of his people to his fortress on a hill named Oblik, close to the southeastern tip of Lake Skadar. According to the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, he performed a miracle there: the hill was infested with venomous snakes, but when he offered up a prayer to the Lord, their bites became harmless.
Part of Samuel's army lay siege to the hill, and the remainder attacked the nearby coastal town of Ulcinj, which was part of the fortification system of the Theme of Dyrrhachium. Vladimir eventually surrendered, a decision the chronicle attributed to his wish to deliver his people from famine and the sword. He was sent to a prison in Samuel's capital of Prespa, located in western Macedonia. Having failed to conquer Ulcinj, which received men and supplies by sea from Dalmatian towns, the tsar directed his forces toward Dalmatia. There he burned the towns of Kotor and Dubrovnik, and ravaged the region as far northwest as Zadar. He then returned to Bulgaria via Bosnia and Raška. A consequence of this campaign was the Bulgarian occupation of Duklja, Travunia, Zachlumia, Bosnia, and Raška. Venetian, and indirectly Byzantine power in Dalmatia was weakened. Samuel succeeded to break up the pro-Byzantine bloc.
The chronicle states that while Vladimir languished in the Prespa prison, praying day and night, an angel of the Lord appeared to him and foretold that he would shortly be freed, but that he would die a martyr's death. His fate in captivity was described in a romantic story involving him and Theodora Kosara, Tsar Samuel's daughter. This is the chronicle's description of how they met:
Kosara then begged her father for Vladimir's hand, and the tsar granted her request. He restored his new son-in-law to the throne of Duklja. In reality, the marriage was probably a result of Samuel's political assessment: he may have decided that Vladimir would be a more loyal vassal if he was married to his daughter. Resolving thus the question of Duklja, Samuel could concentrate more troops in Macedonia and Thessaly, the main site of his conflict with Byzantium. The chronicle claims that the tsar also gave Vladimir the whole territory of Dyrrachium. The prince could in fact have been given a northern part of that territory, which was partially under Samuel's rule. A brief note on Vladimir by John Skylitzes may indicate that the prince also received some territory in Raška. His paternal uncle Dragimir, ruler of Travunia and Zachlumia, who had retreated before Samuel's army, was given back his lands to rule, also as the tsar's vassal.
Thereafter, as recorded in the chronicle, "Vladimir lived with his wife Cossara in all sanctity and chastity, worshipping God and serving him night and day, and he ruled the people entrusted to him in a Godfearing and just manner." There are no indications that Vladimir took any part in his father-in-law's war efforts. The warfare culminated with Samuel's disastrous defeat by the Byzantines in 1014, and in the same year, on 6 October, the tsar died of a heart attack. He was succeeded by his son, Gavril Radomir, whose reign was short: his cousin Ivan Vladislav killed him in 1015 and ruled in his stead. Vladislav sent messengers to Vladimir demanding his attendance at the court in Prespa, but Kosara advised him not to go and went there herself instead. Vladislav received her with honor and urged Vladimir to come as well, sending him a golden cross as a token of safe conduct. The chronicle relates the prince's reply:
Two bishops and a hermit came to Vladimir, gave him a wooden cross, and confirmed that the tsar had made a pledge of faith on it. Vladimir kissed the cross and clutched it to his chest, collected a few followers, and set off for Prespa. As he arrived, on 22 May 1016, he went into a church to pray. When he exited the church, he was struck down by Vladislav's soldiers and beheaded. According to Skylitzes, Vladimir believed Vladislav's pledge, told to him by the Bulgarian archbishop David. He then allowed himself to fall into Vladislav's hands, and was executed. The motivation behind the murder is unclear. Since Samuel's defeat in 1014, the Bulgarians had been losing battle after battle, and Vladislav probably suspected or was informed that Vladimir planned to restore Duklja's alliance with Byzantium. This alliance would be particularly disturbing for Tsar Vladislav because of the proximity of Duklja to Dyrrhachium, which was a target of the tsar's war efforts.
In early 1018 Vladislav led an unsuccessful attack against Dyrrhachium, outside whose walls he found his death. The chronicle asserts that Vladimir appeared before Vladislav when he dined in his camp outside Dyrrhachium, and slew him while he cried for help. In the same year, the Byzantine army—led by the victorious Emperor Basil—terminated the First Bulgarian Empire. As Vladimir and Kosara had no children, his successor was his uncle Dragimir, ruler of Travunia and Zachlumia. Accompanied by soldiers, he set off for Duklja to establish himself as its ruler, probably in the first half of 1018. When he came to Kotor, the town's inhabitants ambushed and killed him after inviting him to a banquet, and his soldiers returned to Travunia. Duklja was not mentioned again in the sources until the 1030s. Some scholars believe that it was placed under direct Byzantine rule around 1018, while others believe it remained a Byzantine vassal state under an unknown native ruler.
Cult.
Jovan Vladimir was buried in Prespa, in the same church in front of which he was martyred. His relics soon became famous as miraculously healing, attracting many people to his tomb. Shortly after his death he was recognized as a martyr and saint, being commemorated on 22 May, his feast day. At that time, saints were recognized without any formal rite of canonization. Vladimir was the first ruler of a Serbian state who was elevated to sainthood. The rulers from the Nemanjić dynasty, who reigned over the Serbian state which grew around Raška, would almost all be canonized—starting with Nemanja, the saintly founder of the dynasty.
Several years after his burial, Kosara transported the remains to Duklja. She interred him in the "Prečista Krajinska" Church, near his court, in the region of Krajina. The relics drew many devotees to the church, which became a center of pilgrimage. Kosara did not remarry; at her request, she was interred in "Prečista Krajinska", at the feet of her husband. In around 1215—when Krajina was under the rule of Serbian Grand Prince Stefan Nemanjić—the relics were presumably removed from this church and transported to Dyrrhachium by the troops of Michael I, the despot of Epirus. At that time Despot Michael had briefly captured from Serbia the city of Skadar, which is only about east of the church. Jovan Vladimir was mentioned as the patron saint of Dyrrhachium in a Greek liturgical text.
In 1368 Dyrrhachium was taken from the Angevins by Karlo Thopia, an Albanian lord. In 1381 he rebuilt, in Byzantine style, a church ruined in an earthquake in the narrow valley of the stream Kusha, a tributary of the Shkumbin River—near the site of the town of Elbasan in central Albania (built in the 15th century). The church was dedicated to Saint Jovan Vladimir, as the inscription which Thopia placed above its south entrance declared in Greek, Latin, and Serbian. The saint's relics were kept in a reliquary, a wooden casket, which was enclosed in a shrine, in height, within the church.
Serbian scholar Stojan Novaković theorized that Vladimir was buried near Elbasan immediately after his death. Novaković conjectured that the earthquake which ruined the old church happened during Thopia's rule, and that Thopia reinstated the relics in the rebuilt church. If Vladimir was previously buried in Duklja, Novaković reasoned, he would not be absent, as he was, from Serbian sources written during the reign of the Nemanjić dynasty, who ruled over Duklja (later named Zeta) from 1186 to 1371. Novaković did not consider the idea that the relics might have been removed from Duklja to Dyrrhachium in around 1215. He commented on the chronicle's account that Kosara transported Vladimir's body "to a place known as Krajina, where his court was": While his court was possibly in the region of Krajina before his captivity, after he married Kosara it could have been near Elbasan, in the territory of Dyrrachium he received from Tsar Samuel. He was interred near the latter court, which was replaced in the chronicle with the former.
An Orthodox monastery grew around the church near Elbasan, and became the center of veneration of Saint Jovan Vladimir, which was limited to an area around the monastery. In the latter half of the 15th century, the territory of present-day Albania was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire, in which Islam was the privileged religion. After losing the Battle of Vienna in 1683, the Ottomans went on the defensive in Europe. In the climate of revival of Christianity in the Ottoman Empire, a hagiography of the saint and a service to him were written in Greek in 1690 at the monastery. It stood under the jurisdiction of the Archbishopric of Ohrid, which became a notable spiritual and artistic force during the leadership of Archbishop Joasaph from 1719 to 1745. In this period, the veneration of Saint Jovan Vladimir was promoted in southern Albania and western Macedonia, as well as beyond the archbishopric, in Bulgaria and among the Serbs in the Kingdom of Hungary.
The monastery became the see of the newly founded Archbishopric of Dyrrhachium in the second half of the 18th century. In more recent times the monastery fell into disrepair, and in the 1960s it was closed by the Communist authorities of Albania; in 1967 the reliquary with the saint's relics was moved to St Mary's Church in Elbasan. The dilapidated monastery was returned to the Church in the 1990s. The restoration of its church and other buildings was completed in 2005. Since around 1995 the relics have been kept in the Orthodox cathedral of Tirana, the capital of Albania, and are brought back to the monastery only for the saint's feast day.
Each year on the Feast of Saint Jovan Vladimir, a great number of devotees come to the monastery, popularly known as "Shingjon" among Albanians. In the morning, the reliquary is placed at the center of the church under a canopy, before being opened. After the morning liturgy has been celebrated, chanting priests carry the reliquary three times around the church, followed by the devotees, who hold lit candles. The reliquary is then placed in front of the church, to be kissed by the believers. The priests give them pieces of cotton that have been kept inside the reliquary since the previous feast. There are numerous stories about people, both Christians and Muslims, who were healed after they prayed before the saint's relics.
On the eve of the Feast of Saint Jovan Vladimir, an All-Night Vigil is celebrated in the churches dedicated to the saint, as is celebrated in other Orthodox churches on the eves of their patron saints' feasts. The liturgical celebration of Vladimir's feast day begins on the evening of 21 May, because, in the Orthodox Church, the liturgical day is reckoned from one evening to the next. Despite the name of the service, the All-Night Vigil is usually not held throughout the entire night, and may last only for two hours. In the Church of St Jovan Vladimir near Elbasan, it lasts from 9 pm to 3 am. Hymns either to Jovan Vladimir or to another saint whose commemoration falls on 22 May, are chanted, on that liturgical day, at set points during services in all Orthodox churches.
Saint Jovan Vladimir is the patron saint of the modern-day town of Bar in south Montenegro, built at its present location in 1976 about from the site of the old town of Bar, which was destroyed in a war and abandoned in 1878. A religious procession celebrating the saint passes on his feast day through the town's streets with church banners and icons. The procession is usually led by the Serbian Orthodox Metropolitan of Montenegro and the Littoral. The bronze sculpture "King Jovan Vladimir", in height, was installed at the central square of Bar in 2001; it is a work by sculptor Nenad Šoškić. Although Vladimir was only a prince, he is referred to as "king" in the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja. He is called the Holy King in southeastern Montenegro, and hence the hillock thought to be the site of his court is named Kraljič ("kralj" means "king").
Cross of Vladimir.
A cross, held by tradition to be the one that Jovan Vladimir received from Ivan Vladislav, and had in his hands when he was martyred, is a highly valued relic. It is under the care of the Andrović family from the village of Velji Mikulići near Bar and, according to the Androvićs, has been for centuries. The cross is made of yew wood plated with silver, with a brass ball attached to its lower arm, into which a stick is inserted when the cross is carried. The cross is high, wide, and thick.
According to Russian scholars Ivan Yastrebov and Pavel Rovinski, the cross was originally kept in the "Prečista Krajinska" Church, in which Kosara had interred Vladimir. The peak of Islamization of the Krajina region was reached at the end of 18th century. The church was torn down, though it is uncertain when and by whom, but the cross was preserved by the people of the region. They believed that it could protect against evil and ensure a rich harvest, and kept it as sacred, although they had converted to Islam. The cross was later taken from them by the neighboring clan of Mrkojevići. As they too converted to Islam, they entrusted the cross to the Andrović family—their Orthodox Christian neighbors. The Mrkojevići considered it more appropriate for the cross to be kept in a Christian home, rather than in a Muslim one.
The cross, followed by a religious procession, is carried each year on the Feast of Pentecost from Velji Mikulići to the summit of Mount Rumija. The procession is preceded by a midnight liturgy in the village's Church of St Nicholas. After the liturgy, the ascent begins up a steep path to the summit of Rumija. The cross, carried by a member of the Andrović family, leads the procession, followed by an Orthodox priest and the other participants. Catholics and Muslims of the region have traditionally participated in the procession. It is carefully observed that no one precedes the cross; to do so is considered a bad omen. The ascending devotees sing:
In the past, the standard-bearer of the Mrkojevići clan, a Muslim, walked next to the cross with a flag in his left and a knife in his right hand, ready to use it if anyone attempted to take the cross. The clan especially feared that the participants from Krajina might try to recover the sacred object. At the end of 19th century the number of Muslims in the procession dropped as their religious and political leaders disapproved of their participation in it. After World War II, Yugoslavia's socialist government discouraged public religious celebrations, and the procession was not held between 1959 and 1984.
Tradition has it that a church dedicated to the Holy Trinity stood at the summit until it was razed by the Ottomans; in another version, the church crumbled after a boy and a girl sinned within. Before 2005, there was a custom to pick up a stone at a certain distance from the peak and carry it to the supposed site of the church in the belief that when a sufficient quantity of stones were collected, the church would rebuild itself. A new church dedicated to the Holy Trinity was consecrated on the site by the Serbian Orthodox Church on 31 July 2005.
The procession arrives at the peak before dawn, and at sunrise the morning liturgy begins. After prayers have been offered, the procession goes back to Velji Mikulići, again following the cross. The participants would formerly gather on a flat area from the peak, where they would spend some five or six hours in a joyous celebration and sports, and have a communal meal. On the way back, some people pick the so-called herb of Rumija ("Onosma visianii"), whose root is reputed for its medicinal properties. The procession ends at the Church of St Nicholas, and folk festivities at Velji Mikulići continue into the night. Until the next Feast of Pentecost, the cross is kept at a secret location. It was formerly known only to two oldest male members of the Andrović family, and since around 2000 the Androvićs have appointed a committee to keep the cross.
Hagiography and iconography.
The oldest preserved hagiography of Saint Jovan Vladimir is contained in Chapter 36 of the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja. This chronicle, written in Latin, was completed between 1299 and 1301 in the town of Bar, then part of the Serbian Kingdom. Its author was Rudger, the Catholic Archbishop of Bar, who was probably of Czech origin. He wrote Chapter 36 as a summary of an older hagiography of Vladimir, written in Duklja most likely sometime between 1075 and 1089. This is the period when Duklja's rulers from the Vojislavljević dynasty endeavored to obtain the royal insignia from the Pope, and to elevate the Bar Bishopric to an archbishopric. They represented Prince Vladimir as the saintly founder of their dynasty; they were, according to the chronicle, descendants of his uncle Dragimir. The Vojislavljevićs succeeded in those endeavors, though Vladimir was not recognized as a saint by the Catholic Church. Despite its hagiographic nature, Chapter 36 contains a lot of reliable historical data. Chapters 34 and 35, which deal with Vladimir's father and uncles, are probably based on the prologue of the 11th-century hagiography. Chapters 1–33 of the chronicle are based on oral traditions and its author's constructions, and are for the most part dismissed by historians.
The hagiography in the chronicle is the source for the "Poem of King Vladimir" composed in the 18th century by a Franciscan monk from Dalmatia, Andrija Kačić Miošić. The poem is part of Miošić's history of the South Slavs in prose and verse, written in the Croatian vernacular of Dalmatia. This book was first printed in Venice in 1756 and was soon read beyond Dalmatia, including Serbia and Bulgaria (then under Ottoman rule, as was most of the Balkans). The "Poem of King Vladimir" is composed in a manner derived from the style of the South Slavic oral epics. It describes Vladimir's captivity in Bulgaria, the love between Kosara and him, Tsar Samuel's blessing of their marriage, and their wedding. It concludes with the newlyweds setting off for Vladimir's court, which Miošić places in the Herzegovinian city of Trebinje.
The Greek akolouthia on Saint Jovan Vladimir, containing his hagiography, prayers to him, and hymns to be chanted in church services on his feast day, was printed in Venice in 1690. The book was reprinted with small changes in 1774 and 1858. It was written from oral traditions by the deputy of the Orthodox Archbishop of Ohrid, Cosmas, who resided at the Monastery of St Jovan Vladimir, near Elbasan. Copies of the book were distributed to other Orthodox churches and individuals. The akolouthia was also published in 1741 in Moscopole, an Aromanian center in southeastern Albania, as part of a compilation dedicated to saints popular in that region. A shorter hagiography of the saint, based on his life contained in this akolouthia, was included in the Synaxarium composed by Nicodemus the Hagiorite, printed in Venice (1819) and Athens (1868). Cosmas's text was the basis for the Church Slavonic akolouthias on the saint, which appeared in Venice (1802) and Belgrade (1861). The latter was printed as part of the third edition of "Srbljak", a compendium of akolouthias on Serb saints, published by the Serbian Orthodox Church. The saint's life in English, translated from Church Slavonic, appeared in the book "Lives of the Serbian Saints", published in London in 1921 by the Anglican Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.
In Cosmas's writing, the saint was named "Jovan from Vladimir"; his father was Nemanja (historically, Grand Prince of Raška from 1166 to 1196), and his grandfather was Simeon (Bulgarian Tsar from 893 to 927). He married a daughter of Samuel, the tsar of Bulgaria and Ohrid. He succeeded his father as emperor of Albania, Illyria, and Dalmatia. After Byzantine Emperor Basil defeated Tsar Samuel, Emperor Jovan defeated Basil. He also fought against the Bogomil and Messalian heretics. From his early youth, Jovan Vladimir longed for the Kingdom of God. After he was married, he prayed day and night, and abstained from intercourse with his wife. She was a heretic like her brother, whom she incited to kill Jovan. When the two brothers-in-law rode together, accompanied by soldiers, the heretic suddenly struck Jovan with a sword at a mountain pass named Derven, but could not cut him. Only when Jovan gave him his own sword was the murderer able to cut off his head. Jovan caught it in the air and rode on to the church he had built near Elbasan. There he put his head down, saying, "Lord Jesus Christ, in your hands I place my spirit," and died; it was  899. He was buried in the church, which then became the scene of many miracles. The saint's beneficent power is described in the hagiography:
According to Vladimir's life in Church Slavonic, he succeeded his father Petrislav as the ruler of Serbian lands; he ruled from the town of Alba. He was captured and imprisoned by the Bulgarian ruler Samuel. After marrying Samuel's daughter Kosara, he returned to his country. Emperor Basil, having overcome Bulgaria, attacked the Serbian lands, but Vladimir repulsed him. Basil advised the new Bulgarian ruler, Vladislav, to kill Vladimir by trickery. Vladislav invited Vladimir to visit him, as if to discuss the needs of their peoples. When Kosara came to him instead, Vladislav received her with apparent kindness; therefore Vladimir came as well. Vladislav was able to cut off his head only after Vladimir gave him his own sword. The saint then carried his severed head to the church he had built near Alba, and died there; it was  1015. He was buried in the church. During Vladislav's siege of Dyrrachium, Vladimir appeared before his murderer when he dined, and slew him while he cried for help. The saint's relics then gushed myrrh, curing various illnesses. The kontakion which is contained, among other hymns, in the Church Slavonic akolouthia published as part of "Srbljak", praises the saint:
In a Bulgarian liturgical book written in 1211, Vladimir was included in a list of tsars of the First Bulgarian Empire: "To Boris, . . . Samuel, Gavril Radomir, Vladimir, and Vladislav, ancient Bulgarian tsars, who inherited both the earthly and the heavenly empires, Memory Eternal." According to the earliest work of Bulgarian historiography composed in 1762 by Paisius of Hilendar, Vladimir, also named Vladislav, was a Bulgarian tsar and saint. His father was Aron, Tsar Samuel's brother. His wife and her brother murdered him because of his pure life and Orthodox faith. Paisius combined Ivan Vladislav and Jovan Vladimir into one character attributed with Vladislav's parentage and Vladimir's sainthood.
An important model for the iconography of Saint Jovan Vladimir is an engraving in the 1690 edition of the Greek akolouthia. It is a work by Venetian engraver Isabella Piccini. She depicted the saint with a mustache and short beard, wearing a cloak and a crown inscribed with lilies, holding a cross in his right hand, and his severed head in his left hand. A portable icon in Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, dated around 1700, shows the saint mounted on horseback.
An icon of Saints Marina and Jovan Vladimir, dated 1711, is part of the iconostasis of the Monastery of St Naum near Ohrid in western Macedonia. The icon's position on the iconostasis indicates that Vladimir was an important figure of local veneration. He was often depicted in the company of Saints Clement and Naum in Macedonian churches. A number of 18th-century painters from central and southern Albania painted the saint in churches of the region, especially in the area of Moscopole. A portable icon of the saint was created in 1739 at the Ardenica Monastery in southwestern Albania. It depicts him seated on a throne, surrounded by twelve panels showing scenes of his life and miracles. Saint Jovan Vladimir is represented on frescos in three monasteries of Mount Athos: Hilandar, Zograf, and Philotheou; and three Bulgarian monasteries: Rila, Troyan, and Lozen.
Hristofor Žefarović, an artist from Macedonia, painted the frescos in the rebuilt church of the Serbian Monastery of Bođani, in the Bačka region (then part of the Kingdom of Hungary) in 1737. There, he depicted Jovan Vladimir in a row of six Serb saints, wearing a crown and sceptre, clad in a full-length tunic, "loros" (a type of stole), and chlamys. In the same row stands another Serb saint from present-day Montenegro, Stefan Štiljanović. Žefarović's frescos in Bođani are regarded as the earliest work showing Baroque traits in the Serbian art. Žefarović created in 1742 in Vienna a copperplate with scenes of the saint's life and miracles. Its printed impressions were disseminated to many Orthodox Christian homes in the Balkans. The same author included him among the rulers and saints whom he illustrated in his "Stemmatographia".
A lithography in the 1858 edition of the Greek akolouthia shows the saint wearing a crown with a double lily wreath, his right foot on a sword. He holds a cross, a sceptre, and an olive branch in his right hand, while his crowned severed head is in his left hand. He wears an ermine cloak and a robe with floral designs, adorned with large gems surrounded by pearls. The Greek text beneath the illustration names the saint as Jovan Vladimir, the pious Emperor of all Albania and Bulgaria, the graceful Wonderworker and Great Martyr, and true Myrrh-gusher. In his hagiography included in the Synaxarium of Nicodemus the Hagiorite, the saint is referred to as Emperor of the Serbs (τῶν Σέρβων βασιλεύς).
Legends.
Several legends about Jovan Vladimir have been recorded in western Macedonia. One has it that, after he was beheaded, he brought his head to the Monastery of St John of Bigor. On a hill above the village of Pesočani in the Municipality of Debarca, there is a locality called Vladimirovo, at which some ruins can be seen. The locals claimed that Vladimir was born there, and brought his severed head there. The Church of St Athanasius near Pesočani, now in ruins, is reputed to have been built by Vladimir. People from the region gathered there each year on the eve of his feast day. They lit candles on the remains of the church's walls, and prayed to the saint. Tradition has it that the Monastery of St Naum had a bell tower named after the saint, in the foundation of which a portion of his relics was placed.
In the western fringe of Macedonia, which is now part of Albania, Jovan Vladimir was remembered as a saintly ruler, cut down by his father-in-law, an emperor, who believed some slander that he was a womanizer. The enraged emperor, accompanied by soldiers, found Vladimir on a mountain pass named Qafë Thanë (also known as Derven), on the road between the Macedonian town of Struga and Elbasan. He struck his son-in-law with a sword, but could not cut him. Only when Vladimir gave him his own sword was the emperor able to cut off his head. Vladimir took his severed head and went toward the site of his future church. There stood an oak, under which he fell after the tree bowed down before him. The saint was interred in the church which was subsequently built at that place and dedicated to him.
According to a legend recorded in the Greek hagiography, Jovan Vladimir built the church near Elbasan. Its location, deep in a dense forest, was chosen by God, and an eagle with a shining cross on its head showed it to Vladimir. After the saint was decapitated, he brought his head to the church, and was buried inside. A group of Franks once stole the casket with his miraculous relics. The casket turned out to be extremely heavy, breaking the backs of hinnies on which the Franks carried it. They eventually put it in the Shkumbin River to take it to the sea, but the river flooded, and the casket—radiating light—went back upstream toward the church. The inhabitants of that area took it out of the water and returned it to the church in a festive procession.
A group of thieves stole, on a summer day, horses that belonged to the Monastery of St Jovan Vladimir. When they came to the nearby stream of Kusha to take the horses across, it appeared to them like an enormous river. They moved away from it in fear, but when they looked back from a distance, the stream appeared small. As they approached it again, the Kusha again became huge and impassable. After several such attempts to cross the stream, the thieves realized that this was a miracle of the saint, so they released the monastery's horses and ran away in horror.
A possible legend of Prince Vladimir was recorded by Branislav Nušić in the 19th century in the city of Korçë, southeastern Albania, close to Macedonia. Ruins on top of a hill above Korçë were said to be remains of the court of a Latin (Catholic) king, whose kingdom neighbored the state of an Orthodox emperor. The king asked the hand of the emperor's daughter, who agreed to become his wife only if he built an Orthodox church. He did so, and she married him, but on the first night of marriage she killed him. She then became a nun, and the king's body was taken somewhere—he was not buried near his court. Macedonian Slavs inhabiting Saint Achillius Island in the Small Prespa Lake in Greece told of an emperor named Mirče. He lived on their island, where he was killed by a cousin of his out of jealousy, and his body was taken via Ohrid to Albania.

Cheboygan Bascule Bridge

The Cheboygan Bascule Bridge, also known as the State Street Bridge, is a double-leaf bascule bridge in Cheboygan, Michigan, carrying U.S. Highway 23 (State Street) across the Cheboygan River. Built in 1940, it was the last bascule bridge constructed in the state of Michigan prior to the end of World War II. It replaced an aging swing bridge built in 1877. The bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
History.
Prior to the construction of the Cheboygan Bascule Bridge, a wrought-iron swing-span bridge crossed the Cheboygan River at this location. It was built in 1877 and by 1940, had become dangerous due to its age and heavy traffic load. Commissioner of the Michigan State Highway Department G. Donald Kennedy stated that it vibrated noisily and the unloaded end caused the "rusty old structure to bounce up and down on its seat." The Cheboygan Bascule Bridge is heavier and wider than this previous span.
The replacement bridge was designed by the state highway department in early 1940; consulting firm Hazelet and Erdal assisted with the bascule span. The contract was awarded to the W. J. Storen Company of Detroit as lowest bidder at $187,511.98. Steel and machinery were provided by the R. C. Mahon Company. Construction was scheduled to begin in May 1940 and finish in late autumn. The bridge was completed at a cost of $206,000 in December 1940, slightly behind schedule, due to the death of the contractor. The bridge was dedicated in a public ceremony on December 7, 1940. The dedication speech was given by G. Donald Kennedy, in which he described the bridge as "an achievement of state-wide significance." This was the final bascule bridge constructed in Michigan before the end of World War II. Other moveable spans planned for Charlevoix, Houghton, and St. Joseph were delayed until after war's end.
The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 9, 1999. It was eligible due to its preservation and as a mainstream example of bascule bridges in the state.
In 2003, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) planned rehabilitation work on the bridge to preserve its historical integrity and maintain safety. The project cost $2.1 million, funded by the Build Michigan II program and TEA-21. Major work commenced in January 2004 and finished in late June. The road surface and sidewalks were replaced and the leaves were balanced. The original railings were replaced with newly fabricated, historically accurate ones and were retrofitted with crash-worthy two-tube railings on the inside. Lighting was changed to match the designs used downtown on a community request. Construction was concentrated in the winter to minimize disruption to marine traffic. , the bridge is rated as functionally obsolete, but not structurally deficient.
Design.
The bridge is a bascule bridge in a Scherzer rolling lift bridge configuration. The bridge's three spans are steel deck girders; the center span has girders of varying depth while the approach spans have uniform-depth girders. The center bascule span is long, flanked by two spans. The approach span road surface is a mixture of asphalt and concrete while the center span is a steel mesh. The roadway is flanked by sidewalks and standard moderne metal guard rails. On the downstream side of the north pier is the single-story bridge tender house. When raised, a navigable channel is available for marine vessels. The concrete abutments are founded on timber pilings and the two concrete piers rest on concrete footings supported by compact gravel below the river surface. The piers are protected by angled cutwaters and cylindrical fenders upriver. The bridge was notable for its safety features. It has six light standards (three to a side) along its length for illumination. Traffic gates and traffic lights warn traffic when the bridge will rise for vessels.
The Cheboygan bridge fits the mainstream of bascule bridge construction in Michigan in the 1930s and 1940s. Even though the bascule span has two leaves, a single leaf "probably would have sufficed" in its location.
Draw schedule.
From May 16 through September 15, the bridge opens on the quarter-hour and three-quarter hour between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. and on signal between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. The bridge also opens on signal from April 1 through May 15 and from September 16 through December 14. For the remainder of the year, from December 15 through March 31, no bridgetender is on duty, and the bridge does not open unless given twelve hours advance notice. For public and commercial vessels and vessels in distress, the bridge is opened as soon as possible.
The draw schedule was amended in June 2001. Prior to the amendment, twenty-four hours advance notice was necessary between December 15 and March 15. MDOT requested a change to twelve hours advance notice between December 15 and April 15 to reduce staffing requirements during the winter months when there is little to no marine traffic. The Commander of the Ninth Coast Guard District determined that the request would infringe on a ferry service that begins operation as early in spring as possible. In 1998, 1999, and 2000, no openings at all took place from December 15 through March 31 while some did through April 15. Thus, the request was modified to affect the period December 15 through March 31.
There has been some interest in adjusting the schedule to reduce automobile congestion. During 2002, the bridge could be raised four times an hour for up to ten minutes each time. Traffic can back up five blocks in either direction, and not wholly clear before the bridge opens again.

Theomachist

Theomachist is a term used to refer to an individual who "resists God or the divine will." The term comes from the Greek words "theos", meaning God and "machē", meaning battle. Karl Marx was considered by many to be a theomachist. In addition, the atheists who established the Cult of Reason in Revolutionary France have also been described with this term.

IBM Mira

Mira is a petascale Blue Gene/Q supercomputer. As of June 2013, it is listed on TOP500 as the fifth-fastest supercomputer in the world. It has a performance of 8.16 petaflops and consumes 3.9 MW. The supercomputer was constructed by IBM for Argonne National Laboratory's Argonne Leadership Computing Facility with the support of the United States Department of Energy, and partially funded by the National Science Foundation. Mira will be used for scientific research, including studies in the fields of material science, climatology, seismology, and computational chemistry. The supercomputer is being utilized initially for sixteen projects, selected by the Department of Energy.
The Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, which commissioned the supercomputer, was established by the America COMPETES Act, signed by President Bush in 2007, and President Obama in 2011. The United States' emphasis on supercomputing has been seen as a response to China's progress in the field. China's Tianhe-1A, located at the Tianjin National Supercomputer Center, was ranked the most powerful supercomputer in the world from October 2010 to June 2011. Mira is, along with IBM Sequoia and the upcoming Blue Waters, one of three American petascale supercomputers deployed in 2012.
The cost for building Mira has not been released by IBM. Early reports estimated that construction would cost US$50 million, and Argonne National Laboratory announced that Mira was bought using money from a grant of US$180 million. In a press release, IBM marketed the supercomputer's speed, claiming that "if every man, woman and child in the United States performed one calculation each second, it would take them almost a year to do as many calculations as Mira will do in one second".

Jawei Chiefdom

Jawei Chiefdom is a chiefdom in Kailahun District of Sierra Leone with a population of 42,635. Its largest town and headquarters is Daru.
Geography.
Jawei Chiefdom is located on the southwestern edge of Kailahun District, bordering Dama Chiefdom and Gaura Chiefdom of Kenema District to the southwest. Jawei borders Jaluahun Chiefdom to the northwest, Mandu Chiefdom to the northeast, and Malema Chiefdom to the southeast. The Moa River transects the chiefdom.
Settlements.
The other important town in Jawei Chiefdom is Benduma. Villages in Jawei Chiefdom include: Bombohun,Nyedehun,Gbajorma,Tomboma,Folu, Giehun, Guma, Kambama, Kutoma,Manowah, Mamabu, Bembeyeima, Pellie and Potoru.
Economy.
The economy is primarily agricultural; however there is some mining. The primary export is palm oil.
Civil war.
During the 1991-2002 civil war various villages in northern Jawei Chiefdom were occupied by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and National Patriotic Front of Liberia ((NPFL)) during their initial on-thrust in Spring 1991. The RUF got as far as Benduma, but did not attack Daru or the Moa Barracks across the river, where the Sierra Leone Army (SLA) was based. Guinean troops soon arrived in Daru to supporrt the SLA. The Guineans attacked and drove the RUF out of Benduma, after which battle neither side stationed troops there. In June 1991, RUF and NPFL attacked the Moa Barracks at Daru, but despite the galantry of the NPFL commander, who was killed on the bridge over the Moa, the Guinean troops and the SLA turned back the assault. Fighting continued in Jawei Chiefdom over the next two years with little change in territory. In December 1992, after an almost successful RUF attack on nearby Segbwema in Jaluahun Chiefdom, some of the Guinean troops were sent from the Moa Barracks to Segbwema. At that same time local hunters, often members of secret hunting societies, began to form into auxiliary units to assist the SLA in Jawei Chiefdom. Finally in May 1993, the SLA with the assistance of these "civilian" units were able to dislodge the RUF from their bases in northern Jawei.
Nonetheless, RUF guerrilla warfare continued in the chiefdom and it was still considered "unsafe" during the February 1996 elections. Shortly after the election, local chiefs were encouraged to send their young men to Kamajor society initiations after which they were formed into Civil Defence Forces (CDF) units. Prior to this the local hunters were under the command of their own chiefs, but this changed them into a "state" force. With this new status the Jawei CDF units began attacking RUF positions without SLA support. By January 1997, some Jawei forces were fighting as far away as Upper Bambara Chiefdom. By September 1997 the Jawei Kamajors had all of Jawei Chiefdom under their control and the guerrilla war there ceased.
In March 1998, Nigerian ECOMOG forces arrived in Daru to support the Kamajors. But this had the effect of drawing combined RUF and Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) forces to attack Daru which they did several times during 1998 and early 1999. The last such attack was on 7 July 1999, just two days before the ceasefire mandated in the Lomé Peace Accord. But the fighting continued anyway with the Kamajors attacking RUF/AFRC positions at Daru Junction on 17 July, driving them out. But the RUF/AFRC recaptured Daru Junction a month later.
In Spring 2000 with the arrival of UNAMSIL personnel disarmament started in Jawei Chiefdom, where a Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration Camp had been set up in November the previous year. But it was interrupted in May by resistance to the northeast. The process was only restarted in late July.
Recent history.
A boundary dispute between Jawei and Malema Chiefdom, arising in 2004 out of the dislocations suffered during the civil war, was settled in 2007 at the direction of the president Bai Koroma.
In September 2009 the chiefdom suffered serve and unusual flooding as the Moa River over flowed. Chief Fadah Kallon said that it was the first such flood ever to hit the chiefdom. The flood has been partially attributed to the chronic deforestation that occurs in Sierra Leone.

Slow-Carb Diet

The Slow-Carb Diet was popularised in "The 4-Hour Body" by Tim Ferriss, and first mentioned by him in a 2007 blog post titled "How to Lose 20 lbs. of Fat in 30 Days… Without Doing Any Exercise". Ferriss claims to have lost about 25 lbs of fat in six weeks on the diet. The Slow-Carb Diet is based on eating foods with a low glycemic index. It can be summarized as the elimination of starches and anything sweet (including fruit and all artificial sweeteners) and a strong preference for lean protein, legumes and vegetables. The main foods are eggs, fish, grass-fed beef, lentils, beans, vegetables (like spinach, broccoli, cabbage, radish), mushrooms, fermented foods and drinks (natto, kimchi, sauerkraut), unsweetened tea or coffee and water. Calorie-dense nuts and legumes such as pecans, chickpeas, hummus, and peanuts are allowed under careful portion control.
Plain coffee is allowed, but all milk products are to be avoided except cottage cheese.
Foods.
These foods are consumed on the Slow-Carb Diet: eggs, meat (grass-fed beef, pork and poultry), turkey bacon, organic bacon, organic sausage, fish, seafood, beans (chickpeas in moderation), vegetables (except starches like potatoes, yams), oil (olive oil, macadamia nut oil, grapeseed oil preferred), ghee, cottage cheese, brown rice protein, hemp protein, pea protein, and unflavored whey protein isolate. Allowed condiments include hot sauce, mustard, salsa without sugar, spices & herbs, unsweetened cocoa, vanilla extract, and non-creamy non-sugar dressings. Ferriss notes that Mexican cuisine is the most compatible with eating out while on the diet, as long as rice is swapped out for vegetables.
Banned foods.
These foods are not consumed on the Slow-Carb Diet: milk, cheese, refined soy products (Soy milk, tofu, tempeh, soy protein shake), fruit (except for sour fruits like lemons and limes, or savoury fruits such as olives,tomatoes and avocados) potatoes (yams, yuca, any starchy vegetable), bread, rice, grains, oatmeal, quinoa, ketchup and all sauces and dressings with sugar, honey, corn syrup, maple syrup, fructose, deep-fried breaded food, corn, popcorn. No alcohol other than dry wine is allowed (Ferriss notes that he drinks a glass of red wine daily).

Battle of Azcapotzalco

The Battle of Azcapotzalco, (), was fought on August 19, 1821, in the town of Azcapotzalco, near Mexico City. It was to be the last major and decisive military action of the Mexican War of Independence. The insurgents, commanded by the colonels Anastasio Bustamante and Luis Quintanar, defeated the Spanish forces commanded by Manuel de la Concha.
Prelude.
By August 1821, The Army of the Three Guarantees, led by Agustin de Iturbide, had control of the majority of towns and important cities of New Spain, leaving only the royalist bastions of Mexico City and the port of Veracruz. Mexico City as capital of the Viceroyalty of New Spain was the key point for ending the 11 year Mexican War of Independence. The Army of the Three Guarantees had surrounded the periphery of the city and the royalist forces were forced into Tacuba (today Miguel Hidalgo) and the old Hacienda of Clavería.
Battle.
Before the battle Agustín de Iturbide went to Córdoba to have a meeting with the Political Superior Chief, Juan O'Donojú, he left command of the troops around Mexico City to Luis Quintanar and Anastasio Bustamante. Bustamante successfully occupied the Haciendas of Cristo and Careaga, (today known as Rosario and Molino de la Hacienda Santa Mónica) and from there he took the next step into Mexico City. On 19 August 1821, the insurgent, Nicolas Acosta, entered Azcapotzalco and took over the Rosario bridge with the purpose of attacking the royalist forces. The attack began in the middle of a rainstorm. As soon as the battle began, the royalist general Manuel de la Concha went to his headquarters in Tacubaya for reinforcements.
The insurgents retired to Azcapotzalco, sending troops to the Hacienda of Careaga. General Concha followed and tried to force them to face him in Azcapotzalco. When the royalist forces arrived, the insurgent forces attacked them in the vestibule and the ceilings of the Convent of the Dominicos. The combat continued until 11 am and stopped when the insurgent ammunition ran out.
Anastasio Bustamante ordered a cannon placed at the entrance of the town but it was unfruitful and he decided to retreat. The famous insurgent soldier Encarnación Ortiz also known as "El Pachondo" tried to rescue the artillery but was shot and killed. The act inflamed the insurgents who assaulted the vestibule, facing the royalist forces hand-to-hand, defeating them and forcing them to flee to the Rosario Bridge.
Aftermath.
The victory by the insurgent forces of the Army of the Three Guarantees forced the royalists to leave the Haciendas of Clavería, Tacuba, Popotla and San Jacinto. Days later independence was granted. The victory of the insurgents in the last battle of the war cleared the way to Mexico City which was finally taken by the insurgents on 27 September 1821, ending the long Mexican War of Independence.
Valentin Canalizo also fought in this battle. He, like Anastasio Bustamante, would later become President of Mexico.

Flora Wambaugh Patterson

Flora Wambaugh Patterson (1847–1928) was an American mycologist, and the first female plant pathologist hired by the United States Department of Agriculture. She ran the US National Fungus Collections for almost thirty years, radically growing the collection and shaping its direction, and supervised or discovered numerous significant fungal diseases.
Flora Wambaugh was born in Columbus, Ohio, to Sarah Sells (Wambaugh) and Methodist minister A. B. Wambaugh. She studied fungi as a hobby in her childhood. She attended Antioch College in Ohio, earning her bachelor's degree in 1865. She then earned two Master's degrees from Cincinnati Wesleyan College. Wambaugh married Captain Edwin Patterson in 1869, assuming his name, and they had two children; she worked to support the family financially. After his death Patterson continued her studies at the State University of Iowa, and in 1892 or 1893 made plans to transfer to Yale University. When Yale rejected her because she was a woman, she moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and began studies at Radcliffe College, where she worked at the Gray Herbarium at Harvard. 
In 1895, Patterson joined the USDA as a pathologist, hired by Beverly T. Galloway along with Franklin Summer Earle. During her almost thirty-year tenure at the USDA, Patterson increased the size of the U.S. National Fungus Collections by almost six times, from 19,000 to 115,000 reference specimens. She identified numerous new species of fungus, including those causing pineapple rot ("Thielaviopsis paradoxa"), peach leaf curl ("Taphrina"), and "witches' broom" on bamboo ("Loculistroma bambusae"), which was an entirely new genus. 
Among other responsibilities, Patterson was in charge of identifying new fungal pathogens, and took a leading role in identifying the chestnut blight that wiped out eastern North America's chestnut forests, and the potato wart disease "Synchytrium endobioticum". Patterson was involved in Japan's gift to the United States of cherry trees, ultimately leading to the destruction of the first shipment of trees which was infected with multiple types of insects and diseases. All of these incidents led to the passage of the Plant Quarantine Act of 1912 which aimed to prevent introduction of invasive harmful diseases.
Patterson continued her work with the USDA until retiring at the age of 75, and then lived with one of her sons in New York City until her death at the age of 80.

Blake Luttrell

Blake Luttrell is a 2007 graduate of the United States Air Force Academy from Nashville, TN. He was born September 13, 1984 to Rodney Luttrell and Jennifer Oakley. He currently serves as a Special Tactics Officer (STO) in the 21st Special Tactics Squadron, 720th Special Tactics Group, 24th Special Operations Wing, Hurlburt Field, FL.
Silver Star Narrative.
On January 9, 2012, Captain Blake Luttrell, a special tactics officer, and his element were conducting a helicopter assault in Afghanistan to capture a known insurgent and improvised explosive device facilitator. Captain Luttrell’s element was ambushed by a battle-hardened group of insurgents located 100 meters away. As Captain Luttrell coordinated Army attack helicopters overhead, two Afghan commandos were fatally shot. Moments later, another Afghan commando received a fatal gunshot wound to the torso. In response, Captain Luttrell and a teammate moved forward to pinpoint the enemy while taking direct, accurate fire.
Captain Luttrell then directed Army AH-64 Apache attack helicopters to suppress the enemy cave complex, which they did with 100 rounds of 30-millimeter shells and four thermobaric hellfire missiles. Captain Luttrell and his element continued to maneuver under hostile fire towards the fortified enemy position, and while clearing a nearby building, his element was attacked by small arms fire from a cave less than five feet away. As one Special Forces Soldier moved around a corner to return fire, he was shot at point-blank range, knocked to the ground, and was subsequently shot again multiple times. Without hesitation, Captain Luttrell aggressively engaged the enemy with his automatic weapon, deployed smoke into the cave entrance, and courageously moved forward despite taking heavy fire. While enemy rounds impacted all around him, he pulled the wounded Soldier from the cave entrance and out of the line of fire.
Captain Luttrell then administered lifesaving treatment to the wounded Soldier by placing tourniquets on both legs. As he conducted first aid, his teammates suppressed the threat, enabling the entire element to maneuver out of the kill zone. Captain Luttrell then coordinated a show of force with attack helicopters and established a helicopter landing zone 200 meters south of the cave to evacuate the wounded Soldier. Once the Soldier was successfully extracted, Captain Luttrell pushed all friendly elements to a safe distance and controlled an Air Force B-1 bomber that dropped a 2,000-pound bomb, destroying the cave and ending the enemy resistance.
Captain Luttrell’s terminal attack control measures resulted in the deaths of four enemy fighters. During the entire engagement, Captain Luttrell remained under intense enemy fire; yet, epitomizing true heroics, he never wavered during the heat of battle. For his actions, he was awarded the Silver Star Medal.
Captain Luttrell's actions were highlighted in the United States Air Force's Vol VII Portrait in Courage in 2012.

Fossati brothers

The Fossati brothers, Gaspare (7 October 1809 — 5 September 1883) and Giuseppe (1822-1891), were Swiss architects. They completed more than 50 projects in Turkey during the Tanzimat era. They belonged to the Morcote branch of the Fossati, a prominent Swiss family with mentions in the historical record going back to the 14th century.
Biography.
Born in Ticino, they finished primary and middle school in Venice and studied architecture at the Brera Academy in Milan. At the end of 1836, Gaspare was appointed to Istanbul for the project of building in the Russian Embassy.
Between 1841 and 1843, the Fossati brothers built the brick Bab-ı Seraskeri Hospital (Bekirağa Bölüğü) and Liman İskelesi Karakolu in Eminönü for the Ottoman Administration. They were appointed to renovate Arzuodası at Babıali in 1844, and to build important buildings in Sultanahmet such as Dârülfünun (university) (1845-1846), Hazine-i Evrak, and Mekteb-i Sanayi (1846-1848).
In 1847, Sultan Abdülmecid appointed them to renovate the Hagia Sophia. They completed the restoration in two years, utilizing more than eight hundred workers.
The Telgrafhane-i Amire building was built by Giussepe Fossati in 1855. Upon the death of Reşit Paşa in 1858, the Fossati brothers built his mausoleum in the corner of the graveyard in the Bayezit complex.
They built the Church of SS Peter and Paul between 1841 and 1843. They also renovated Venedik Palace (today the house of the Italian Ambassador) in 1853, and the Dutch Embassy in Beyoğlu in 1854. They built the Spanish (1854) and Iranian (1856) embassies in Istanbul. In addition, they built three Italian theaters. One of them was the Naum Theatre, which was built in Galatasaray in 1846, and destroyed by a fire in 1870.
In 1858, the Fossati brothers returned to Switzerland. They built their homes in Morcote in the Turkish style. They are buried in Morcote.

<doc id="36804100" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36804100" title="Szimón Krofey">
Szimón Krofey

Szimón Krofey was born in 1545 in the Kashubian village of Dąbie, Gmina Bytów, Poland. His father, Wawrzyniec Krofey, was the mayor of Dąbie, and was well enough off to send young Szimón off to the university at Wittenberg. In 1579, after finishing his studies, he became pastor of the Lutheran church in Bytów. 
In 1586 and 1588, respectively, Reverend Krofey published two vitally important works in the Kashubian language, both of which were translations from German intended for Kashubian Lutherans: "Duchowne piesnie D. Marciná Lutherá y ynßich naboznich męzow. Zniemieckiego w Slawięsky ięzik wilozone Przes Szymana Krofea, sluge slova Bozego w Bytowie". ("Spiritual Songs of Doctor Martin Luther") and "Maly katechizm D. Marciná Lutherá Niemiecko-Wándalski ábo Słowięski to jestá z Niemieckiego językáw Słowięski wystáwion" ("Small Catechism"). In 1896, the songbook was rediscovered in Smoldzino by Franz Tetner; the catechism was republished in 1643 by the Lutheran pastor Michael Brüggemann (also known as Mostnik or Pontanus), "polonised" in 1758, and ultimately "re-Kashubised" by Florian Ceynowa in 1861 as "Pjnc głovnech wóddzałov evangjelickjeho katechizmu z njemjeckjeho na kaśebsko-słovjenskj jęzek".
Scholarly opinion is divided on whether Reverend Krofey's two books were the first books published in Kashubian, but the dispute hinges strictly on linguistic concerns, not historical. One side holds that Reverend Krofey wrote, as Józef Borzyszkowski puts it, "in Polish with abundant Kashubianisms." Jerzy Treder and Cezary Obracht-Prondzyński, on the other hand, hold that the works were written in Kashubian and therefore constitute "the origins of Kashubian literature:"
These two books are also considered important for an understanding of the Slovincian language, along with Brüggemann's reworking of the "Small Catechism" and similar texts published in 1700 by the Lutheran pastor J.M. Sporgius, also of Smoldzino.
Reverend Szimón Krofey died in 1590. To honor his undisputed importance in the history of Kashubian literature, the Bytow chapter of the Kashubian-Pomeranian Association has recently issued a souvenir golden ducat called the "Krofeya."

Richard Irving Bowman

Richard Irving Bowman (1918–2001) was an abstract painter who worked primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area. He painted in an idiosyncratic style inspired by transcendental visions of nature, exposure to surrealism and investigations into sub-atomic physics. He is considered one of the first fine artists to employ fluorescent paint, which he maintained embodied sub-atomic life energy, beginning in the early 1950s.
Background.
Bowman was born in Rockford, Illinois in 1918. He graduated from the Art Institute of Chicago School in 1942, and received a Masters Degree in Fine Arts from the University of Iowa in 1949. During the 1940s he taught at the Art Institute of Chicago. One of his students was the abstract expressionist painter Joan Mitchell, with whom he exhibited and was romantically linked. In 1950 he was invited to teach in the newly formed art department at the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada. In 1954 he came to San Francisco at the invitation of Gordon Onslow Ford. From 1949- 1963 he taught intermittently at Stanford University in Stanford, CA. Bowman's reputation and success rose during the period from 1959-1977, when he exhibited continuously at the Rose Rabow Gallery
Exhibitions.
Bowman was the subject of one-person shows at the Pinacotecha Gallery, New York (1947), The Stanford Art Gallery, Palo Alto, CA (1950,56) and the San Francisco Museum of Art, San Francisco, CA (1961,1970). He exhibited at the Rose Rabow Gallery in San Francisco 1959-1977, and was associated with expatriate painters Gordon Onslow-Ford and other artists who coalesced around the space. He was a peripheral figure in the San Francisco Bay Area beat and abstract expressionist scenes and was linked through friendship and aesthetics to the artist, publisher and scientist Bern Porter, and the poet Kenneth Patchen.

State of Wonder

Plot summary.
The novel opens with Dr. Marina Singh reading a letter from Dr. Annick Swenson to Mr. Fox. Anders Eckman, her co-worker at the pharmaceutical company Vogel, has reportedly died at Dr. Swenson’s research site in the Amazonian rainforest. Eckman’s widow begs Marina to find out what happened, and Mr. Fox agrees to send her. Mr. Fox’s other motive is that Dr. Swenson has been given a blank check to conduct research into a new miracle drug, and refuses to inform him of her progress.
Finding Dr. Swenson proves to be difficult. Marina flies to Manaus, Brazil, and finds that the only people who know Dr. Swenson’s whereabouts are an Australian couple named Jackie and Barbara Bovender. Eventually Dr. Swenson surprises Marina in Manaus, and they travel in a boat piloted by a young deaf boy named Easter to the rainforest research site, near the encampment of an indigenous people called the Lakashi tribe. The women of this tribe bear children until the end of their lives, an ability they get from eating the bark of an endemic tree called the martin. The drug Vogel is funding is one that will prevent or undo menopause and allow women to give birth in the later years of their lives. Over time, Marina discovers that, unknown to Vogel, the bark of the martin also serves as a vaccination against malaria; it is this drug that Dr. Swenson is primarily concerned with. She fears that no pharmaceutical company would fund such an unprofitable venture, so she uses secrecy to acquire the funds for her humanitarian project; also, she worries that the Lakashi people would be destroyed if the outside world knew of their valuable resources. Marina learns that Dr. Swenson has become pregnant, at the age of 73, since eating the bark of the martins.
Mr. Fox, Vogel CEO and Marina's lover, visits the research site along with Mrs. Bovender and a local taxi driver. Along the way, their boat was attacked by a local cannibalistic tribe known as the Hummocca; Mrs. Bovender sees a white man among them who she thinks is her father. Marina allows Mr. Fox to leave without finding out the dual purpose of the drug he has been funding. Dr. Swenson has Marina perform a Caesarian section upon her, but the child is stillborn. Afterwards Dr. Swenson tells Marina of her suspicion that the man Mrs. Bovender saw was really Anders, whose death she had never confirmed. Along with Easter, Marina sets out to find the Hummocca and rescue Anders. When they come to the tribe, Marina discovers that the only trade acceptable to the Hummocca is an exchange of Easter (a Hummocca himself) for Anders. Marina and Anders return to camp without Easter; Dr. Swenson is outraged that the boy she cared for was left behind. After one night of making love, Marina and Anders return to Minnesota; Anders rejoins his wife and sons, and Marina, continues on home.
Critical reception.
The book has received mostly favorable reviews. Writing in the "New York Times",
Fernanda Eberstadt calls the novel “an engaging, consummately told tale.” In the same newspaper, Janet Maslin’s review praises the novel, writing that “this book’s central issue, its unresolved rivalry… the dragon of a teacher who lurks somewhere in every student’s academic history.” 
Laura Ciolkowski calls it “a suspenseful jungle adventure with an unexpected ending and other assorted surprises,” but complains about the novel’s “tendency to…offer up a curiously cliched view of life beyond the knowable edges of home.” Susan Storer Clark writes that "Patchett’s gift for combining the mythic with the practical, her ability to create memorable characters and truly ingenious plot twists make "State of Wonder" a rich and rewarding read."
The novel was nominated for the Wellcome Trust Book Prize (2011), and shortlisted for the Orange Prize for Fiction (2012). It was listed for a Salon Book Award (2011), Christian Science Monitor Best Book (2011), Time Magazine's Best Books of the Year (2011), The Morning News Tournament of Books (2012), Publishers Weekly's Top 10 Best Books (2011), and New York Times bestseller (2011).
In a second edition of "State of Wonder", Bloomsbury Publishing printed on the cover the novel had won the 2012 Orange Prize for Fiction, except it didn't win - that honour actually went to Madeline Miller's debut "The Song of Achilles", also published by Bloomsbury, who blamed it on a printing error and claimed to pulp all remaining erroneous copies of "State of Wonder".

<doc id="36804135" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36804135" title="Usurpation of Qi by Tian">
Usurpation of Qi by Tian

The Usurpation of Qi by Tian (Traditional Chinese: 田氏代齊), was the deposition of the Jiang clan (姜氏) as rulers of the state of Qi, and their replacement by members of the Tian clan (田氏). This occurred as a series of events between 481 and 379 BCE, through which the Tian clan cemented its position as the leading family in Qi. The final acts of this usurpation (391-379 BCE), in conjunction with the Partition of Jin (376 BCE), mark the transition from the Spring and Autumn Period to the Warring States period.
The Tian clan continued to use the name "Qi" for their realm after the usurpation. For historiographical purposes, pre-usurpation Qi is referred to as "Jiang Qi" (姜齊), while post-usurpation Qi is referred to as "Tian Qi" (田齊).
Background.
Qi was originally ruled by the Jiang clan, the descendants of Jiang Ziya. In 672 BCE, Prince Yuan of Chen fled to Qi following political unrest in his native fiefdom and adopted the surname of Tian, thus being the progenitor of the Tian clan. By 545 BCE, the Tian clan was one of the strongest families in Qi. Tian Huanzi, in conjunction with other prominent families, eliminated the Qing clan (慶氏), the Luan clan (欒氏), and the Gao clan (高氏).
At the same time, the Tian clan also sought the support of the minor Qi aristocrats and the Qi populace. Tian Huanzi granted fiefdoms to those Qi aristocrats who were not granted lands, and took steps to demonstrate his charity by providing food relief to the poor. His successor, Tian Xizi, garnered additional support through providing low-interest loans to the peasants. At the same time, the Dukes of Qi were seen as venal and corrupt; support for the Tian clan thus gradually overshadowed support for the Jiang clan.
Political Usurpation.
In 489 BCE, Duke Jing of Qi died. The major cadet branches of the Jiang clan, the Guo clan (國氏) and the Gao clan (高氏, probably no relation to the earlier Gao clan), favored the accession of Prince Tu (公子荼) to the throne. On the other hand, Tian Xizi supported Prince Yangsheng, expelled the Guo and Gao clans, and then installed Prince Yangsheng on the throne as Duke Dao of Qi, with Tian Xizi himself as Prime Minister. After this, the Tian clan's status was paramount in Qi.
In 481 BCE, Tian Xizi's successor Tian Chengzi killed Duke Jian of Qi (and possibly his father Duke Dao of Qi as well in 485 BCE), as well as numerous members of the Jiang clan. He then installed Duke Jian's brother, Duke Ping of Qi to the throne. Following this, the Tian clan became the "de facto" rulers of Qi.
In 391 BCE, Tian Xizi's great-great-grandson Tian He deposed Duke Kang of Qi. However, Tian He did not install a new leader this time; Qi therefore was in interregnum between 391 and 386 BCE.
In 386 BCE, Tian He exiled the former Duke Kang onto a small island in the Yellow River delta and declared himself Duke. In the same year, the Zhou court formally recognized Tian He's new position as Duke, and legitimized the rule of the Tian clan over Qi.
In 379 BCE, the former Duke Kang died, thus ending a line that stretched back to the beginning of the Zhou Dynasty. The Tian clan's hold on Qi would continue until Qi's annexation by the Qin in 221 BCE.

Bringelly Shale

Bringelly Shale is a component of the Wianammatta group of sedimentary rocks in the Sydney Basin of eastern Australia. It was formed in the triassic period. It is most often seen in the western parts of the city. The shale has its greatest geographical extent at Bringelly, near the suburb of Liverpool. It is similar to Ashfield Shale, though differing in having a greater amount of sandstone and lacking sideritic mudstone bands. The average thickness is around 60 metres. The Bringelly Shale was deposited in a swampy alluvial plain with meandering streams flowing from the west forming discontinuous beds of sandstone.

Khan Yunis Camp

Khan Yunis Camp (), also spelled Khan Younis Camp, is a Palestinian refugee camp in the Khan Yunis Governorate just west of the city of Khan Yunis and two kilometers east of the Mediterranean coast in the southern Gaza Strip. While UNRWA states that there were approximately 72,000 Palestinian refugees living in the camp in 2010, the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics recorded a population of 37,705 in the 2007 census. 
Khan Yunis Camp was established after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, accommodating roughly 35,000 Palestinian refugees. On 3 November 1956, the camp and city of Khan Yunis were occupied by the Israel Defense Forces. In the ensuing operation, about 275 people were killed, including 140 refugees from the camp. Residents state that most of the casualties occurred after hostilities had ended, with the army searching houses for suspected armed men. However, Israeli authorities stated the casualties were a result of resistance by the camp's residents.
According to UNRWA, many of the camp's residents have lost their homes as a result of operations by the Israeli military. UNRWA began reconstruction efforts in the early 2000s, but work has largely been halted due to the blockade imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip following the Hamas takeover of the territory. UNRWA say that at least 10,000 homes need to be constructed.

U.S. National Fungus Collections

The National Fungus Collections of the United States is the "world's largest herbarium of dried fungus specimens". It is housed within the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). 
The collection was established in 1869 from a core of fungus collections transferred from the Smithsonian Institution to the USDA. F. Lamson Scribner (1885-1891) and Franklin S. Earle (1891-1896) were the first two directors, followed by Flora Wambaugh Patterson in 1896. Patterson vastly increased the size of the collection from approximately 19,000 reference specimens to almost 115,000. 
Patterson and other mycologists at the collection during Patterson's tenure, including Vera K. Charles, identified numerous commercially threatening fungi, including the bubble disease of mushrooms (1909), the potato wart disease ("Synchytrium endobioticum"), and chestnut blight. These and other invasive diseases led to the passage of the Plant Quarantine Act of 1912.
These scientists were part of a wave of government-funded research into agriculture and disease. Vera Charles also worked on fungal pathogens of insects. The National Fungus Collection also hired a number of other scientists all of whom did significant work on economically important crops. These included Anna E. Jenkins, hired in 1912, who became the "foremost authority" on spot-anthracnose fungi. Edith K. Cash, hired in 1913, investigated discomycetes (cup fungi) and William W. Diehl (hired in 1917) wrote extensively on "Balansia" which causes sterility in grass plants.
After Patterson's retirement, James R. Weir ran the collection for four years; his work at the collection ultimately led to use of "Neurospora" as a model organism for genetic research.

Curtis Dickman

Curtis Dickman is an American Neurosurgeon at the Barrow Neurological Institute, and is recognized internationally for his pioneering work in the field of Thoracoscopic Neurosurgery. He serves as Director of the Spine Research Laboratory and Associate Chief of the Spine Section at the Barrow Neurological Institute.
Career.
After graduating from Medical school at the University of Arizona, Dr. Dickman began his neurosurgical training at the BNI, and was one of the first group of residents to train under Drs. Robert Spetzler and Volker Sonntag. He completed a fellowship in spine at the University of Florida, and soon thereafter was hired on staff of the BNI.
Thoracoscopic Spine Surgery.
In the early 1990s, Dr. Dickman became heavily involved in both the development and popularization of endoscopic assisted spine procedures within neurosurgery. He pioneered the field of thoracoscopic neurosurgery, becoming one of the first neurosurgeons to use endoscopes to treat diseases of the thoracic spine via a minimally invasive method. He translated a relatively new technology utilized in the cardiothoracic surgical sub-specialty for neurosurgical purposes, and developed some of the basic instruments commonly used today by neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons alike for minimally invasive thoracic spinal procedures. Thoracoscopic spine surgery has since become a common treatment modality for a multitude of neurosurgical pathologies, including Herniated Thoracic Discs and Hyperhidrosis. Dr. Dickman currently remains one of the most prolific thoracoscopic spine surgeons in the world, and has literally written the only textbook on the subject. His recently published series on the subject has become a standard by which other neurosurgeons are measured against. 
In addition to his work on Thoracoscopic procedures, Dr. Dickman has published numerous textbooks and papers on the craniocervical junction. He is well known for the "Sonntag-Dickman Fusion," a special method of fusing the upper cervical spine.

Tricholoma vaccinum

Tricholoma vaccinum, commonly known as the russet scaly tricholoma, the scaly knight, or the fuzztop, is a fungus of the agaric genus "Tricholoma". It produces medium-sized fruit bodies (mushrooms) that have a distinctive hairy reddish-brown cap with a shaggy margin when young. The cap, which can reach a diameter of up to wide, breaks up into flattened scales in maturity. It has cream-buff to pinkish gills with brown spots. Its fibrous, hollow stipe is white above and reddish brown below, and measures long. Although young fruit bodies have a partial veil, it does not leave a ring on the stipe.
Widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, "Tricholoma vaccinum" is found in northern Asia, Europe and North America. The fungus grows in a mycorrhizal association with spruce or pine trees, and its mushrooms are found on the ground growing in groups or clusters in late summer and autumn. Although some consider the mushroom edible, it is of poor quality and not recommended for consumption. The ectomycorrhizae of "T. vaccinum" has been the subject of considerable research.
Taxonomy and naming.
The species was first described in 1774 by German mycologist Jacob Christian Schäffer as "Agaricus vaccinus". According to MycoBank, synonyms include August Batsch's 1783 "Agaricus rufolivescens", Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's 1783 "Amanita punctata" var. "punctata", and Lucien Quélet's 1886 "Gyrophila vaccina". Marcel Bon described the variety "T. vaccinum" var. "fulvosquamosum" in 1970, which has squamules (minute scales) arranged in a concentric fashion on the cap; Manfred Enderle published this taxon as a form in 2004.
According to the infrageneric classification of "Tricholoma" proposed by Rolf Singer in 1986, "Tricholoma vaccinum" is placed in the section "Imbricata", subgenus "Tricholoma" in the genus "Tricholoma". "Imbricata" includes species with a dry cap cuticle, with a texture that ranges from roughened or squamulose (resembling suede) to almost smooth. The specific epithet derives from the Latin word "vaccinus" and means "cow-colored". The mushroom's common names include the "russet scaly tricholoma", "fuzztop", and "scaly knight".
Description.
The cap of "T. vaccinum" is initially broadly conical, then convex and finally flattened; its diameter is usually between . The cap margin is initially curved inwards, and shaggy from hanging remnants of the partial veil. The partial veil is cotton-like, and does not leave a ring on the stipe. The fibrous to scaly cap surface ranges in color from reddish-cinnamon to brownish-orange to tan. The gills have an adnate to sinuate attachment to the stipe, and are crowded closely together. There are between three and nine tiers of lamellulae—short gills that do not extend completely from the cap edge to the stipe. The gills are dingy white, and frequently stain reddish-brown. The stipe is long and thick, and becomes hollow in age. It is roughly equal in width throughout its length and ranges in color from whitish to the same color as the cap, but lighter, and sometimes with reddish-brown stains; it is lighter in color near the apex. Like the cap, the stipe surface is fibrous to scaly. The odor of the fruit bodies is unpleasant.
The mushrooms produce a white spore print, and the spores are broadly elliptical, smooth, hyaline (translucent), inamyloid, measuring 6–7.5 by 4–5 μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, without clamps, and measure 17–32 by 6.0–7.5 μm. The hymenium lacks cystidia. The arrangement of the hyphae in the cap cuticle ranges from a cutis (with hyphae that run parallel to the cap surface) to a trichoderm (hyphae perpendicular to the cap surface); these hyphae are roughly cylindrical, and measure 3.5–8.0 μm wide, with roughly cylindrical to club-shaped ends that are 6.0–11.0 μm wide. There are no clamp connections in the hyphae of "T. vaccinum".
Although the fruit bodies are considered edible, they are of low quality, and generally not recommended for consumption due to their resemblance to and potential for confusion with toxic brown Tricholomas. Orson K. Miller, Jr. considers them "bitter and not edible". The fruit bodies can be used to create yellow dyes to color wool or other fibers.
Similar species.
With its reddish-brown wooly cap, white gills, and hollow stipe, "Tricholoma vaccinum" is a fairly distinct mushroom and is unlikely to be confused with other "Tricholoma". "Tricholoma imbricatum" somewhat resembles "T. vaccinum", but has duller brown colors, is less robust in stature, and has a solid (not hollow) stalk. Another lookalike, "T. inodermeum", has a less woolly cap texture and flesh that turns bright pinkish red when injured. It associates solely with pine species and prefers calcareous soil. Other brownish "Tricholoma" species include "T. fracticum", "T. dryophilum", and "T. muricatum". The scaly and fibrous cap surface of "T. vaccinum" might be confused with "Inocybe", but species in this genus can be distinguished by their brown spore prints.
Habitat and distribution.
"Tricholoma vaccinum" is a mycorrhizal species, and grows in association with coniferous trees, especially pine and spruce. It forms ectomycorrhizae that have been called "Medium-Distance fringe exploration type", indicative of the ectomycorrhiza's ecological role in space occupation in the soil, their possible reach regarding nutrient acquisition and their demand of carbohydrates that have to be invested by the trees for their fungal partners. Fruit bodies usually appear in groups or clusters on the ground, sometimes with moss. The fungus fruits in late summer and autumn. It is found in northern Asia, Europe, and, in North America, is widely distributed in the United States and Canada, and has also been recorded in Mexico. It is one of the most common species of "Tricholoma" in Central Europe, and is often found in large groups in spruce forests. It is rare in the United Kingdom, and most records have been from Scotland. The fungus may be extinct in the Netherlands.
The ectomycorrhizae of "T. vaccinum" has been the subject of considerable research. Ectomycorrhizae of "Tricholoma" species can vary considerably among species in the genus, and differences in the structure of rhizomorphs (a cordlike fusions of hyphae resembling a root) have been used to key out species. Mycorrhizae formed with Norway spruce ("Picea abies") are conspicuously hairy with numerous hyphae. The hyphae are partly densely interconnected to rhizomorphs that have a pigment in their outer membrane. The emanating hyphae mostly lack "contact septae" (fully developed simple septae) and contact clamps, and the rhizomorph hyphae vary markedly in diameter. The Hartig net (a network of hyphae that extend into the root) formed by "T. vaccinum" grows more deeply towards the epidermis, is composed of more rows of hyphae and has more tannin cells in close proximity to the epidermis, and consequently, fewer cortical cells in this position. It is here that the rhizomorphs make the closest contact with the rootlets. The mantle is prosenchymatous, meaning that the constituent hyphae are loosely organized with spaces between them. A combination of techniques including freeze fracturing and scanning electron microscopy has been used to probe the microstructure of the ectomycorrhizae, including inner mantle thickness and the nature of the interface between the Hartig net and host cells. Several fungal genes specifically expressed during ectomycorrhizal interaction between "T. vaccinum" and "Picea abies" have been identified, including some involved in a plant pathogen response, nutrient exchange and growth in the plant, signal transduction, and stress response. The first characterized fungal aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme, ALD1, helps circumvent ethanol stress—a critical function in mycorrhizal habitats.

Metamaterials surface antenna technology

Metamaterials surface antenna technology (M-SAT) is an invention that uses metamaterials to direct and maintain a consistent broadband radio frequency beam locked on to a satellite whether the platform is in motion or stationary. Gimbals and motors are replaced by arrays of metamaterials in a planar configuration. Also, with this new technology phase shifters are not required as with phased array equipment. The desired affect is accomplished by varying the pattern of activated metamaterial elements as needed. The technology is a practical application of metamaterial cloaking theory. The antenna is approximately the size of a laptop computer.

Zhang Yang (warlord)

Zhang Yang (died 198), courtesy name Zhishu, was a warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. Originally from Yunzhong Commandery (雲中, northern Shanxi) in the north, he eventually became the "de facto" ruler of Henei Commandery (河內, southern Shanxi). Although threatened by powerful warlords such as Cao Cao and Yuan Shao, Zhang Yang still provided refuge for Emperor Xian of Han numerous times, eventually attaining the rank of Grand Marshal (大司馬).
Early life.
Zhang Yang was known for his bravery, and originally served a mid-level post in his native Bing Province (modern Shanxi). Under the direction of Governor Ding Yuan, Zhang Yang served under the eunuch Jian Shuo as a vice-marshal (假司馬). With the death of Jian Shuo and the rise of He Jin, Zhang Yang was sent to fight bandits in Shangdang (上黨, southwestern Hebei).
As a warlord.
With He Jin's death and the rise of Dong Zhuo, Zhang Yang attempted to seize Shangdang for himself, but was unable to do so. When Yuan Shao called for a campaign against Dong Zhuo, Zhang Yang went to join him but was not given significant duties. In 191, the Hun leader Yufuluo revolted and sought Zhang Yang's support; Zhang Yang's refusal resulted in his kidnapping. Yuan Shao's forces eventually defeated Yufuluo and Zhang Yang was freed.
After his release, Zhang Yang was appointed by Dong Zhuo as commander of Henei. 
In 192, Zhang Yang took in his friend and Dong Zhuo's assassin Lü Bu, who was wanted by Dong Zhuo's successor Li Jue. Lu Bu left for Yuan Shao not long after, only to return in 193. In 194, Lü Bu asked Zhang Yang if he was planning to betray Lü Bu to Li Jue. As Zhang Yang's generals were all bribed by Li Jue, Zhang Yang openly admitted his intention of betraying Lü Bu, while secretly protecting him from Li Jue. Nevertheless, Lü Bu again left Zhang Yang for Zhang Miao not long after.
In 195, the minister Dong Cheng brought Emperor Xian to Henei in an attempt to avoid the forces of Li Jue. Zhang Yang's hospitality earned him the titles of "General Who Pacifies the Country" (安國將軍) and "Marquis of Jinyang". Over the course of the year, Zhang Yang recommended Emperor Xian return to the capital Luoyang, but this was rejected by the emperor's entourage. Finally, in 196, Zhang Yang escorted Emperor Xian back to Luoyang, and also oversaw the reconstruction of the imperial palace (which was burnt down by Dong Zhuo in 191). Unlike most other warlords, who kept the emperor for political benefit, Zhang Yang returned to Henei after the completion of his mission. For his deeds he was promoted to Grand Marshal.
In 198, as Cao Cao was preparing to campaign against Lü Bu, Zhang Yang made preparations to assist the latter. These preparations were cut short, however, after he was assassinated by his subordinate Yang Chou, who then attempted to surrender to Cao Cao only to be killed by Sui Gu, who then surrendered to Yuan Shao.
The "Yingxiong Ji" (英雄記) states that Zhang Yang was "of mild and merciful temperament, and under him there were no harsh punishments."

Ygnacio Sepulveda

Ygnacio Sepulveda (1842–1916) was one of the first two judges of the Superior Court in Los Angeles County, California, and a noted attorney there and in Mexico City, Mexico.
Family and education.
Ygnacio Sepulveda was born in Los Angeles on July 1, 1842, the son of Jose Andres Sepulveda, grantee of Rancho San Joaquin in Orange County, and Francisca Avila. His grandfather was Francisco Sepulveda, the grantee of Rancho San Vicente in Los Angeles County. His early boyhood was spent in Los Angeles, but when older he was sent to prep schools in Boston, Massachusetts.
He was married on December 13, 1883, to Herlinda de la Guerra of Santa Barbara, California. He and his wife, who died in 1920, had two daughters, Conchita Sepulveda Chapman and Ora Sepulveda, and two sisters, Mrs. Thomas D. Mott and Tranquilina Sepulveda.
Legal career.
California.
Sepulveda was admitted to the State Bar in 1860 or 1863 and, a Democrat, he served one term in the California Legislature (1863–65). He was elected a county judge in 1863 or 1869 and a district judge in 1874 or 1875. He became one the first two Superior Court judges for Los Angeles County in 1879, the other being Volney E. Howard. In 1872 he was a member of the first governing board for the Los Angeles Public Library system.
Mexico.
In December 1883 Sepulveda left Los Angeles and moved to Mexico City, where he spent thirty years practicing law and became the administrator of jurisprudence and legislation under the administration of President Porfirio Diaz. In 1895 he was made the first secretary and "chargé d'affaires" of the United States in Mexico. While in that country, in 1905 he helped organize the Guadalupe Council of the Knights of Columbus.
In 1895 Sepulveda was elected a member of the Mexican Academy of Jurisprudence and Legislation.
Return.
He returned to Los Angeles in 1914, with his wife and one daughter, to find a city greatly changed. He told a reporter that:
I am constantly comparing myself to Rip Van Winkle, and there is a certain sadness in this coming back after thirty years. With the exception of a flying visit six years ago, I have not seen my old home in all that time. . . . The disturbed conditions in Mexico were large factors in my decision to give up our home in that country.
Death.
Sepulveda died at the age of 74 on December 2, 1916, in his home at 2639 Monmouth Avenue in today's University Park district. A requiem mass was celebrated on December 5 at Saint Agnes Church, Vermont Avenue and West Adams Street, and interment followed at Calvary Cemetery.
Legacy.
In 2006, Sepulveda's was one of the first names placed on a Wall of Fame sponsored by the Los Angeles County Bar Association.

2008 All Japan Regional Football Promotion League Series

The 32nd annual All Japan Regional Football Promotion League Series took place from 22 November 2008 to 30 November 2008. It took place across the prefectures of Fukuoka, Kōchi, Tottori and Okinawa. It is the tournament which decided promotion to the Japan Football League for the 2009 season. As three teams were promoted from the Japan Football League to J. League Division 2, the top three teams in this competition were promoted: Machida Zelvia, V-Varen Nagasaki and Honda Lock.
Tournament outline.
Preliminary round - Four groups of four teams play each other once in a round-robin tournament. The top placed team in each group advances to the final round.
Final Round - The four winners from the preliminary round play each other once in a round-robin tournament.
Three points are awarded for a win in standard time and zero for a lose. If at the end of standard time the result is a tie, a penalty shoot-out is held; the winning team is awarded 2 points and the losing team 1.
If the number of points are the same, the league position is ordered by goal difference, then the number of goals scored, and finally the result between the respective teams. If the 1st place position cannot be decided by these factors, a play off will be contested between top two teams.
Participating teams.
Runner-Up from selected leagues.
Regional Leagues whose representative reached the final round in 2007, are eligible for a second team to represent them. This would normally be four teams, however this year there were only three.
High performing teams in the All Japan Senior Football Championship.
NEC Tokin were originally announced to participate, however due to poor business performances from their parent company, their entry was withdrawn and replaced by fourth place Matsumoto Yamaga.

Genital regeneration

Genital regeneration encompasses various forms of treatment for genital anomalies. The goal of these treatments is to restore form and function to male and female genitalia by taking advantage of innate responses in the body. In order to do this, doctors, such as Wake Forest's Anthony Atala, have experimented with stem cells and extracellular matrix to provide a framework for regenerating missing structures. More research is needed to successfully move the science from laboratory trials to routine procedures.
Patients who stand to benefit most from this field are those who have congenital defects, cancer, injuries that have excised parts of their genitalia (most notably soldiers in war), transgender women/men, and men and women wishing to reverse forms of intentional modification such as circumcision. As is the case in most scientific pursuits, these accomplishments might be applied to other forms of regeneration and vice-versa as scientists continue to study tissue engineering.
Autologous cell therapies.
In the last decade, there have been notable accomplishments in utilizing extracellular matrices (ECM) and stem cells to reconstruct lost tissue. These cover a range of structures including the genitals. Professor Atala and his group at Wake Forest University's Institute of Regenerative Medicine have successfully regenerated fully functioning rabbit penises that were excised for the sake of the experiment. Autologous cells were attached to a three-dimensional collagen matrix. Once formed, the structure was attached and tested for functionality.
An Italian doctor named Dr. Cinzia Marchese has successfully reconstructed the inner mucosal lining of congenitally deformed vaginas by using an enzyme to break down the abnormal lining, before inserting stem cells to remodel the walls and restore normal functionality.
There are currently no therapies available for men attempting to clinically regenerate structures of the human penis. Also, for women there are no therapies that use autologous cells to regenerate the clitoris, sometimes removed in cases of female genital mutilation. 
Other therapies.
The following therapies do not rely on autologous cells:
A vibration technique developed by Ellen L. Barnard and Myrtile Wilhite claims to promote regeneration in the vaginal cell lining. A topical cream developed by Lyle Corporate Development, Inc., claims to encourage regeneration of tissues in the vulva that have undergone cellular hypoxia.
There are rudimentary techniques of promoting cellular division to alter the structure of the penis, often referred to as foreskin restoration, and are not to be confused with regeneration.
There are manual reconstruction techniques such as those developed by French surgeon Pierre Foldès. His procedure provides women with a clitoris, but is not considered a regenerative medicine.
Organizations.
Some organizations which perform research into, or conduct regeneration procedures, include the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, the United States Department of Defense, and the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine. An organization called Foregen is attempting to privately fund research into regenerating structures of the foreskin.

Jan Nepomucen Głowacki

Jan Nepomucen Głowacki (1802 – July 28, 1847) was a Polish realist painter of the Romantic era, regarded as the most outstanding landscape painter of the early 19th century in Poland under the foreign partitions. Głowacki studied painting at the Kraków School of Fine Arts and later at the academies of Prague and Vienna, as well as Rome and Munich. He returned to Kraków in 1828, and became a teacher of painting and drawing. From 1842 he served as a professor in the Faculty of Landscape Painting at the School of Fine Arts. His work can be found at the National Museum of Poland and its branches. Some of his work was looted by Nazi Germany in World War II and has never been recovered.
Work.
Głowacki was born in Kraków, where he lived for most of his life. He took his first art lessons with the painter Antoni Giziński, and between 1819 and 1825 attended the workshops of Józef Brodowski and Józef Peszka at the School of Fine Arts in Kraków. He continued his studies in Prague and then at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna under Franz Steinfeld until 1828. He went to Rome in 1834/35 and finished his studies in Munich. While abroad, he went by the name Jean Nepomuk Glowacki. Upon his return from Vienna, Głowacki became a teacher of art in his hometown and also a prolific artist. He painted mostly landscapes and city scapes, as well as portraits, and religious or mythological scenes. He was influenced by the Viennese school of realism, which was especially apparent in his portrait studies. Polish art critics and historians consider him the father of Polish school of landscape painting.
Głowacki was the first Polish artist to devote an entire series of works to the Tatra Mountains. He was also the first, to produce studies for his oil paintings on strenuous outdoor trips. Landscapes such as "" (View from Poronin, 1836) and "" (1837) are said to mark the beginning of realist Polish mountain painting. His Romantic city scapes of Kraków and its environs became very popular during his lifetime thanks to an album of 24 prints that he published in 1836. He was married and had a son, Justyn Jan Głowacki, born in 1838, and a daughter Emilia (ca 1840). Very little else is known about his personal life.

Giant malleefowl

The giant malleefowl ("Leipoa gallinacea") is an extinct megapode that was native to Australia. It was described from Plio-Pleistocene deposits at the Darling Downs and Chinchilla in south-east Queensland by Charles De Vis, who erected the genus "Progura" for it. Material referrable to the species has also been collected from South Australia and from Wellington Valley and the Wombeyan Caves of New South Wales.
Taxonomy.
Comparison of Australian megapodes showed that "Progura" was closely related to the living malleefowl ("Leipoa ocellata"), though the fossil species "gallinacea" was considerably larger than the living one. A second species, "P. naracoortensis", was described in 1974 by van Tets from deposits in the Naracoorte Caves of south-eastern South Australia indicating differing size and leg proportions. It is now considered a synonym of "L. gallinacea", which was evidently sexually dimorphic.
Description.
Its weight was estimated by van Tets to vary from 4–7 kg (8-15 lb). The proportions of the long bones were similar to, though larger and more robust than, those of the malleefowl, and it had a relatively broader bill, head and body. The deep keel on the sternum indicates that it was capable of flight.

Alpha Coal Project

The Alpha Coal Project is a coal mine and railway project in Queensland, Australia. The development is expected to cost A$6.9 billion. Coal exports would leave the country via port facilities at Abbot Point after being transported along a 495 km rail line.
The project is being jointly developed by the Indian conglomerate GVK and Hancock Coal. Hancock holds a 21% interest in the project. The life of mine is expected to be 30 years.
The mine is the first to be approved by both the Government of Queensland and the Federal Government to be built in the Galilee Basin. State approval was granted on the 29 May 2012 and federal approval was granted on the 23 August 2012. According to GVK Hancock Coal managing director Paul Mulder, it is also the first fully integrated project to be built in Australia. The major benefit of this is that queues of ships waiting for cargo off-shore from the port can be avoided.
The mine is to be built about 40 km northwest of the small town of Alpha in Central West Queensland. 4,000 staff are expected to be employed during construction with another 2,000 needed for on-going operations.
The Minister for Environment Tony Burke has stipulated the project must adhere to 19 conditions aimed at protecting the Great Barrier Reef.
Peak production is expected to reach 80 million tonnes per year. The first coal production is planned to occur during the 2015/16 financial year. It is expected to deliver coal to ship at $55 a tonne. This is because ore at the mine is easy to mine and the terrain between the mine and port is relatively flat. A 2013 Oxford University study forecast a coal price of at least $US90 to go forward and $150 to generate economic gains for the project. A slowing in demand from China was also cited as a concern which would influence the viability of the mine.

Lucius Cornelius Lentulus (c. 42 BC – c. AD 4) was a Roman politician and military officer who served as consul in 3 BC.
Biography.
A member of the Patrician gens Cornelia, Lentulus was probably the son of Lucius Cornelius Lentulus Cruscellio and Sulpicia. An adherent of Tiberius, Lentulus was elected consul alongside Marcus Valerius Messalla Messallinus in 3 BC. In around AD 4, he was appointed the Proconsular governor of "Africa Proconsularis". During his time as governor, he was confronted by uprisings of the native tribes in the south of the province and beyond the borders. During an expedition into the Libyan Desert against one of the tribes, the Nasamones, he was killed.
At some point, Lentulus offered his daughter Cornelia Lentula in marriage to Lucius Volusius Saturninus, the suffect consul of AD 3, to whom he married.

Keegan Brown

Keegan Brown (born 5 November 1992) is an English darts player who plays in Professional Darts Corporation events. He is the 2014 PDC World Youth champion and is mentored by Australian player Simon Whitlock.
Career.
Brown began playing darts at the age of nine and was playing in men's county league games for the Isle of Wight at the age of 13.
He qualified for the 2011 PDC Under-21 World Championship but lost to Michael van Gerwen 2–4 in the last 64.
In January 2012, Brown entered the Professional Darts Corporation's Q-School event in an attempt to earn a two-year tour card. He achieved this by finishing seventh on the Order of Merit after the four days of play, comfortably inside the top 24 who win their places. He mainly concentrated his 2012 season around Youth Tour tournaments, winning the 14th event in September. However, he also posted some impressive results out of the handful of main tour events he did play, most notably in the fifth and sixth Players Championships. In the former he lost to Justin Pipe 6–2 in the last 16 and in the latter he defeated the likes of James Wade, Andy Hamilton and Terry Jenkins, before losing in the semi-finals 6–1 to Dave Chisnall.
Brown entered 2013 ranked world number 86. He lost 5–3 to Joey Palfreyman in the second round of the UK Open having beaten Keith Rooney and Shaun Griffiths in prior rounds. Brown played a combination of Challenge Tour and ProTour events during the year with his deepest run on the main tour coming at the ninth Players Championship in October, which was highlighted by a second round 6–1 victory over Phil Taylor, before he was beaten 6–2 in last 16 by Mark Dudbridge in the last 16. However, his tour card expired at the start of 2014 and with Brown being ranked 102nd in the world, well outside of the top 64 who retain their places, he once again entered Q School. Brown lost in the final round on the first day 5–3 to Kyle Anderson, but a further defeat in the last 16 on the third day saw him finish tied second on the Q School Order of Merit to earn a fresh two year tour card.
Brown was beaten 5–3 by Austria's Mensur Suljović in the second round of the 2014 UK Open. In the quarter-finals of the seventh Players Championship event, Brown averaged an incredible 112.32 to beat Ben Ward 6–1, sealing his win with a 10-darter. He then defeated Peter Wright 6–5 to make his first PDC final and missed four darts for the title against Robert Thornton in a 6–5 loss.
In May, he won the World Youth Championship 6–4 against Rowby-John Rodriguez at the O2 Arena in London as part of the Premier League finals night. The title has secured Brown a place in the 2014 Grand Slam of Darts and 2015 World Championship.

Côn Đảo Prison (), also Côn Sơn Prison, is a prison on Côn Sơn Island (also known as Côn Lôn) the largest island of the Côn Đảo archipelago in southern Vietnam (today it is in Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu Province. The prison was built in 1861 by the French colonists to jail those considered specially dangerous to the colonist government. Many of the high ranking leaders of Vietnam were detained here. It is ranked a special historical relic of national importance by the government of Vietnam. The most famous site in this prison is "tiger's cage" (vi:"chuồng cọp"). The cage covers an area of 5.475 m2, of which the area of cell is 1.408 m2, sunbath room covers 1.873 m2 and other space covers 2.194 m2. The prison includes 120 cells.
The prison was closed after the country united and just opened for visitors later.
History.
French era.
In 1861, the French colonial government established a prison on the island to house political prisoners. In 1954, it was turned over to the South Vietnamese government, who continued to use it for the same purpose. Notable prisoners held at Côn Sơn in the 1930s included Phạm Văn Đồng and Lê Ðức Thọ.
Not far from the prison is Hàng Dương Cemetery, where some of the prisoners were buried.
Vietnam War.
During the Vietnam War, prisoners who had been held at the prison in the 1960s said they were abused and tortured. In July 1970, two U.S. Congressional representatives, Augustus Hawkins and William Anderson, visited the prison. They were accompanied by Tom Harkin (then an aide), translator Don Luce, and USAID Office of Public Safety Director Frank Walton. When the delegation arrived at the prison, they departed from the planned tour, guided by a map drawn by a former detainee. The map led to the door of a building, which was opened from the inside by a guard when he heard the people outside the door talking. Inside they found prisoners were being shackled within cramped "tiger cages". Prisoners began crying out for water when the delegation walked in. They had sores and bruises, and some were mutilated. Harkin took photos of the scene. The photos were published in "Life" magazine on July 17, 1970.

Related to the black yeasts, it is one of the most commonly isolated fungi that cause primary cerebral phaeohyphomycosis, an infection caused by molds and yeasts that have cell walls pigmented brown due to melanin. "E. dermatitidis" has a worldwide distribution, although most reported cases of cerebral infection are from East Asia. It can be found in soil, feces, plants and fruit, although its ecological niche has not yet been determined. The fungus is commonly isolated from the walls of saunas and steam baths, an environment it which it thrives due to its thermophilic nature. Its heat tolerance may be due to polysaccharides it produces that protect it from heat stress.
The relative ease with which its genome can be manipulated make this species a model organism "for the more than 100 other dematiaceous (melanized) agents of human disease".
It has been implicated as a possible cause of chromoblastomycosis.

<doc id="36805017" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36805017" title="Conditional dependence">
Conditional dependence

In probability theory, conditional dependence is a relationship between two or more events that are dependent when a third event occurs. For example, if "A" and "B" are two events that individually affect the happening of a third event "C", and do not directly affect each other, then initially (when the event "C" has not occurred)
Eventually the event "C" occurs, and now if event "A" occurs the probability of occurrence of the event "B" will decrease (similarly event B occurring first will decrease the probability of occurrence of "A" in future). Hence, now the two events "A" and "B" become conditionally dependent because their probability of occurrence is dependent on either event's occurrence. Intuitively we can say that since "A" and "B" both were probable causes of "C", given "C" has occurred, occurrence of either of A or B alone could explain away the happening of "C".
Conditional dependence is different from conditional independence. In conditional independence two events which are initially dependent become independent given the occurrence of a third event.

2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics gold post boxes

To commemorate British gold medal winners at the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics, postal companies including Royal Mail painted a number of post boxes gold. Each gold medallist had a post box painted in recognition of their achievement, usually in their home-town. It marked the first occasion in modern times that the colour of post boxes in the United Kingdom had been changed from their traditional red. The project was launched on 24 July by painting the pillar box at Westminster Abbey, whilst the first athletes' boxes to be painted were in Lossiemouth, Moray, Scotland, and Penzance, Cornwall, England to commemorate the victory by Heather Stanning and Helen Glover in the women's coxless pair rowing. 
In addition to the post boxes a first class stamp depicting each medal winning individual or team was produced.
On 2 November 2012 it was announced that the gold postboxes would retain their new colour permanently and would be marked with their associated athlete on a plaque.
Public response.
The boxes were met by a very positive public reaction and have became tourist attractions within their local areas and many people have their photos taken alongside them.
Several of the post boxes were subsequently vandalised. These included those recognising triathlete Alistair Brownlee, rower Kat Copeland, heptathlete Jessica Ennis, and tennis player Andy Murray. Fans picked flecks of paint off Murray's box as souvenirs, while Ennis's box was defaced with the words "Go Jess". The gold post box in Jarrow celebrating paralympian Josef Craig has also been vandalised.
Unofficial painted post boxes.
A number of additional post boxes were painted by members of the public; a box in Wyke Regis was painted silver to commemorate the silver medal won by Nick Dempsey, fans painted a post box in Doddington in Lincolnshire bronze in honour of hockey bronze medallist Georgie Twigg; a man in Lymington, Hampshire was arrested after painting a box gold to commemorate the gold medal of Ben Ainslie who lives in the town; Ainslie's official box was in Cornwall where he grew up. Similarly, in Lowestoft, fans painted a box bronze to honour boxer Anthony Ogogo. This led to public campaigns to get further post boxes painted in other locations.
Royal Mail eventually agreed to repaint a post box for Ainslie in Lymington, canoeist Tim Baillie had a second box painted in a more central location, and a box was painted in Henley-on-Thames to mark the over one hundred Olympic medal winning rowers who have trained at the town's Leander Club. Outside the United Kingdom, Guernsey Post painted a post box gold on the island of Sark to commemorate Carl Hester's team dressage success, while Isle of Man Post did the same for Peter Kennaugh following success in the cycling team pursuit.
Paralympics.
While initially planning to only commemorate Olympic gold medallists, on 15 August 2012, Royal Mail confirmed that it would also be painting a post box and producing a first class stamp for each British gold medal winner at the 2012 London Paralympics.
Northern Irish sprinter Jason Smyth won two gold medals at the Paralympics, competing for Ireland. Royal Mail initially chose not to provide gold postboxes in his home village of Eglinton, or the hometowns of fellow Irish gold medal winners Michael McKillop and Bethany Firth, saying "the stamps and gold post boxes were specifically for gold medal winning Olympian and Paralympians who competed for Team GB." Following public support for the painting of boxes Royal Mail relented and decided to paint boxes in Eglinton for Smyth, Glengormley for McKillop and Seaforde for Firth.

Save Yourself (True Blood)

The episode focuses on Eric's last attempt at trying to rid Bill of Lilith's madness as well as planning his escape with Nora; Sookie and the faeries fight against Steve Newlin and Russell Edgington. The season is loosely based on The Sookie Stackhouse Series' fifth book Dead as a Doornail, although much more of the book and its successors are incorporated than in previous seasons. The episode is preceded by Sunset and is followed by the season 6 premiere episode. The episode has mostly had good reviews, outbeating its predecessors in viewers, except for Turn, Turn, Turn! which remains with the most amount of viewers, with 5.20.
Plot.
After the fey club is left vulnerable, leaving Russell to feed on them at will, the faeries start using their magic, which makes him more hungry. Sookie and the others are then saved by Eric, who kills Russell.
Sookie checks on Jason, who has been zapped by faerie magic and has visions of his parents telling him to hate vampires, which he later begins to do. Sookie's faerie scent strongly tempts Nora. Eric intervenes forcing Nora to promise to not eat Sookie. Eric then asks for Sookie's help in rescuing Bill and defeating the Vampire Authority and convinces Sookie, Tara, and Jason to help.
Bill has gone more into darkness, going so far as to control the Authority and injure Jessica and put her in a cage.
After much reconnaissance Sam finds Luna Garza's daughter Emma and comes up with an escape plan. Luna transforms into Steve Newlin and gathers Emma, still in wolf cub form from the cage. Steve NewLuna walks out of the compound and is nearly out before she is stopped by an angry Rosalyn Harris. Rosalyn demands that Steve go on live television to control the damage caused by his and Russell's Greek night. Sam shapeshifts into a housefly and follows Rosalyn, Steve NewLuna and Emma to the studio. Luna loses control during the interview and shifts back into herself on live TV. She outs the Authority's plan for the planet before Rosalyn is able to cut the feed by knocking over the camera. Sam flies into Rosalyn's mouth and shifts back into human form exploding and killing Rosalyn.
Meanwhile, Alcide fights J.D. in a rematch and is able to defeat and kill J.D. with the help of V given to him by his father. He proclaims himself pack master, declares new rules of conduct and orders any non-followers to leave.
Andy decides to tell Holly about his pregnant faerie "girlfriend" and just as he does she goes into labor and delivers 4 baby girls on the Merlotte's pool table with Holly acting a nursemaid. Once the babies are delivered their mother leaves them with Andy, noting his obligation as part of the light contract that he must ensure at least half of the children reach adulthood.
After successfully entering the Authority, Jason, Tara, Nora and Eric kill many guards. Sookie and Tara then rescue Pam and Jessica from the cages, and Pam and Tara share a kiss. Once the entire group has regrouped at the elevator Jessica reveals her strong feelings for Jason, who rejects her due to his visions and new vampire hate. Sookie and Eric send the group out of the compound while they return to try and retrieve Bill Compton.
Salome drinks from the vial containing Lilith's blood only to discover that Bill has tricked her into drinking blood laced with silver. Bill then stakes Salome. After she dies, Bill is about to drink the true Lilith blood but is stopped by Eric and Sookie. Sookie and Eric try to reason with Bill but Bill dismisses Eric and suggests to Sookie he faked his feelings for her. Bill reminds her of the first night they met, when he told her about how vampires usually turn on the people they love the most. Bill drinks the Lilith blood, he grins, but is killed within seconds by the blood. Sookie starts crying. They believe Bill to be dead but he reforms in the style of Lilith. Eric shouts "RUN!" at Sookie and they both run.
Critical Reception.
Critical response has been mixed to positive.
Viewers.
"Save Yourself" is the second highest viewed episode of the season with 5.05 million viewers. This puts it behind only the season premiere, "Turn! Turn! Turn!", which drew 5.20 million viewers.
Season Six.
Shortly before the fifth season's release, it was reported that HBO had renewed True Blood for a sixth season. The sixth season was later revealed to be based on the sixth book in the series, Definitely Dead, and will continue the fifth season's events. Filming was reported to begin late 2012, but was postponed after news that Anna Paquin was pregnant. Filming was later rumored to begin early 2013. This was later officially confirmed towards the fifth season's finale. The season will premiere during the summer of 2013, late June. It is implied that the sixth season will feature Warlow and 'Billith' while going on with the season's events. It was revealed that this season would be two episodes shorter than the usual 12 episodes (there will only be 10 episodes in all). This was later revealed to be due to Paquin's pregnancy.

Music Mouse

Music Mouse is an algorithmic musical composition software developed by Laurie Spiegel.
Spiegel's best known and most widely used software, "Music Mouse - An Intelligent Instrument" (1986) is for Macintosh, Amiga and Atari computers. The "intelligent instrument" name refers to the program's built-in knowledge of chord and scale convention and stylistic constraints. Automating these processes allows the user to focus on other aspects of the music in real time. In addition to improvisations using this software, Spiegel composed several works for "Music Mouse", including "Cavis muris" in 1986, "Three Sonic Spaces" in 1989, and "Sound Zones" in 1990. She continued to update the program through Macintosh OS 9, and as of 2012, it remained available for purchase or demo download from her website.

Billing descriptor

Billing descriptor is the way a company's name appears on a credit card statement and is set up when the merchant account is established. It is used by the credit card customer to identify who a payment was made to on a particular transaction. 
The name used is typically the trading name of the business rather than the legal name so that it can be easily recognised by the customer. The billing descriptor may also be made up of a soft or dynamic descriptor that includes the name of the service provided, this is often used by large companies that provide many services and where the brand of the service is more familiar than the company name.
Selecting a clear billing descriptor is important for a merchant to avoid a chargeback when the credit card customer does not recognise name on the transaction.
Static descriptors.

Greedy Ghost

Greedy Ghost () is a Singaporean comedy horror film and the third film in the Singapore "Ghost" franchise (the first being "Where Got Ghost?", and the second being "The Ghosts Must Be Crazy"; the cast differs, though), directed and written by Boris Boo. The film is executive produced by local funnyman Mark Lee, stars Kang Kang, Henry Thia, Brendan Yuen and Jesseca Liu, and is about the greed of a worker at a funeral parlour causing him to see actual ghosts. The film is Lee's very first attempt as an executive producer and is also the inaugural time in which his talent company, Galaxy Entertainment, is funding a movie. Officially opened in cinemas on August 16, 2012, in Singapore, and on July 26, 2012, in Malyasia, filming commenced and took place in the latter.
Plot.
Whilst at his workplace (a funeral parlour), Lim (Kang Kang) discovers a mysterious book that is wordless, but, though, has a "Book Spirit" (Mark Lee) in it, who decides to gives him winning lottery numbers and financial advice. The winnings at first are meager, and are soon quickly depleted as Lim shares them with his two chums, Ah Nam (Brendan Yuan) and Lao Hui (Henry Thia), both of whom excavate bones from old graves for a living. Not wanting to turn from sudden riches to rags, Lim quickly approaches the Book Spirit once more. The spirit cautions Lim and warns him to think first, for there would be consequences, should he want to strike big. Overwhelmed by the thought of the vast fortune he would receive, Lim agrees to pay the price for his riches, although uncertain of what it would be. As Lim's life gets better and more lavish, he also becomes increasingly dependent on the Book Spirit, seeking its advice in everything. Soon, the Book Spirit reveals the price for which Lim has to pay for all his acquired riches... his life! It is only with Lim’s demise that he can be the next Book Spirit, thus liberating the current Book Spirit. Little does Lim expect, the richer he gets, the closer he is to his death...
At the same time, Nam steals some valuables he finds in a coffin so as to satisfy his cravings to gamble, albeit Hui trying to persuade him not to.
Strange incidents start to happen following that. A vengeful spirit begins to haunt Nam and Hui, causing them much distress…

Don't Forget Me (Smash song)

"Don't Forget Me" is an original song introduced in the fifteenth episode of the first season of the musical TV series "Smash", entitled "Bombshell". It was written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, but in the show's universe, it was written by the songwriting team of Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) and Julia Houston (Debra Messing) for their Marilyn Monroe musical "Bombshell".
In the episode, the song is sung by Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee) as Marilyn Monroe during a Boston preview for the musical after having just taken over the role from Rebecca Duvall (Uma Thurman), who has been felled by illness. 
The song is reprised by Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) in the twelfth episode of Season 2, "Opening Night", as part of the performance of "Bombshell's" opening night on Broadway opening, with Ivy playing the lead of Marilyn. 
The song was initially released as a single from iTunes and Amazon.com's MP3 store and is currently available on the cast album Bombshell. 
Production.
The song is about Marilyn Monroe's legacy, how she will inspire people, and make the world a better place through her tragic 'cautionary tale'. It has a tempo of quarter = 138 and is described as "Moderately flowing". The song ranges from F#3 to Eb5. It starts off in the key of E Major, but has a key change after the first chorus to F Major and another at the end of the bridge to G-flat Major.
Within the context of the series, the song is written by the songwriting duo as a finale song in under 3 hours after a reprise of Let Me Be Your Star in a suicide scene was deemed too depressing as the final number. After all the drama that went on beforehand, "Karen walks out onstage managing to memorize the song in record time and brings down the house with 'Don’t Forget Me'. As the song ends, "we see Ivy back in the dressing room with a bottle of pills". Chris Rovzar of Vanity Fair suggests the following, "we don’t hear the final response from the Bombshell audience, but the way they reacted during the key change in “Don’t Forget Me” suggests they were poised to give a standing ovation". The song ends with the camera spinning in a circle around Karen as she "triumphantflail[s...her armin the air".
Critical reception.
Chris Rovzar of Vanity Fair comments that "the lyrics were terrible and the composition spotty", and questions whether this was because within the context of the episode, "Tom and Julia supposedly did write it in just three hours", or because Shaiman and Wittman had genuine faith on the song. While he says that Karen "hit song out of he park", he suggests that some lyrics were less than believable, such as "help for the downtrodden”, which he argues was never "one of Marilyn’s signature messages".
Though he gave the show as a whole much praise, even stating that "buy tickets for it tomorrow if the show actually existed", Michael Slezak of TV Line gave Don't Forget Me a negative review, describing the "final ballad [that Tom and Julia cook...up for Karen" as "downright embarrassing". He described the music as in the style of "rejected Disney princess theme songs", and also criticized the out-of-place and cheesy lyrics, such as, ”when you sing happy birthday to someone you love/or see diamonds you wish were all free/ Please say that you won’t, I pray that you don’t forget me”. He claims that the song requires a rewrite.
PerezHilton.com described Don't Forget Me as a "breathtaking finale performance".
JJ of TV Is My Pacifier said of the song, "the orchestration was amazing, the lyrics worked, and it really tied into Marilyn and the music of 'Bombshell'. I couldn't have imagined a better finale".
Idolhead wrote in his blog that the song is "one for the ages", and speculated it would be up for an award, along with “Let Me Be Your Star”, the unofficial theme song of the show.
Nathaniel Rogers of Thefilmexperience.net describes the song as "the second worst original song in a generally sensational musical score", and described it as a "weak song" that sounds like the "interchangeable anthemic ballads that they always end American Idol with". He gave the song a C- grade.
Jonathan Elliott of CinemaBlend.com describes the song as a "nice capper on the season".
Pat Cerasaro of broadwayworld.com describes "Don't Forget Me" as the "spine-tingling new swan song epilogue for the show-within-the-show".

Group R

In relation to motorsport governed by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, Group R refers to a set of regulations providing production-derived vehicles for outright competition. The Group R regulations were created in 2012 as a replacement for Group A and Group N cars, and took effect from 2013. No new cars will be homologated under Group A or Group N regulations, and instead existing cars are reclassified according to Group R rules. As part of its structure, the Group R regulations have a provision for GT cars, known as RGT.
Classes under Group R.
Group R consists of six classes, designated R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and RGT; some of these groups will contain their own sub-groups, with cars allocated to each group based on their weight, engine size and powertrain. Teams and drivers are sorted into a specific championship based on the class their car fits into. Cars classified as R1, R2 and R3 contest the World Rally Championship-3 for two-wheel drive cars; specially-prepared R3T cars are also used in the Junior World Rally Championship. Cars classified as R4 and R5 compete in the World Rally Championship-2 alongside existing Super 2000 and Group N Production Cars. Cars classified as RGT are not eligible to compete in either the WRC-2 or WRC-3 championships, but may instead compete for World Championship points alongside World Rally Cars.

<doc id="36805370" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36805370" title="Molière authorship question">
Molière authorship question

The Molière authorship question is a controversy started in 1919 when Pierre Louÿs, in two articles titled "Corneille est-il l'auteur d'Amphitryon ?" ("Is Corneille the author of "Amphitryon"?") and "Molière est un chef-d'œuvre de Corneille" ("Molière is a masterpiece by Corneille"), claimed that he had uncovered a literary hoax. According to him, Molière had not written his own plays and had had Pierre Corneille for a ghostwriter; or, more precisely, Molière was a proxy for Corneille, following a practice which Louÿs believed was common but which one in fact does not encounter in 17th Century literature except for pamphlets and some collections of scholarly jokes around the turn of the century.
Louÿs therefore wrote in line with two recent publications by Abel Lefranc, a professor at the Collège de France, who had contributed to discussion of the Shakespeare authorship question by publishing one by one in 1918 and 1919 the two volumes of a book titled "Sous le masque de William Shakespeare : William Stanley, VIe comte de Derby", propounding the Derbyite theory of Shakespeare authorship. Louÿs, who had himself, throughout his career, published a number of works under different pseudonyms—he had even made his name by passing off his "The Songs of Bilitis" as an original collection of Greek poems translated by him—but had not in his vast correspondence suggested any possible link between Molière and Corneille, jumped at the chance to transpose onto Molière the doubt that some English-speaking authors (well before Abel Lefranc) had expressed about Shakespeare and to lend thus to Corneille the same taste for pseudonymity.
This controversy, which attracted interest from time to time through the 20th Century after the splash made by Louÿs, has been renewed at the beginning of the 2000s, notably with the publication in a scientific journal of two articles attempting to use stylometric analysis to show the closeness of vocabulary and syntax between Corneille and Molière; but, in both cases, the inquiry was not expanded to other authors of comedies in the 17th Century to verify whether the similarity between Corneille and Molière is any greater than with their other contemporaries. As in the case of Shakespeare, this theory is rejected by all experts on Corneille and Molière, as well as historians of literature and French drama generally, who do not even mention it.

Route description.
Rush Creek Trail starts at the Coon Rapids Dam in Brooklyn Park. The trail heads west and goes through the West Coon Rapids Dam Visitor Center parking lot. The trail then crosses the Mississippi River Trail (MRT, also known as the West River Parkway). The trail then starts heading through rural north Brooklyn Park. The trail crosses both Noble Parkway, where it also crosses the Shingle Creek Regional Trail, and Zane Avenue via tunnels. The trail crosses Winnetka Avenue and then goes over US Highway 169 via a bridge right before exiting Brooklyn Park into Maple Grove. The trail crosses Jefferson Highway via a stoplight-controlled crosswalk. The terrain in Maple Grove is much different than Brooklyn Park. Maple Grove's is more a northern look—a lot of trees—where Brooklyn Park has more of a farm look. The trail crosses James Dean Parkway at the Elm Creek Park Preserve. The trail then goes through the park and ends at Medicine Lake Trail.

It was released as the second single from Grimshaw's debut album "Misty Eye". The song features vocals from Labrinth's sister ShezAr.
Music video.
A music video to accompany the release of "Curtain Call" was first released onto YouTube on 11 July 2012 at a total length of four minutes and one seconds.
Critical reception.
Robert Copsey of "Digital Spy" blog gave the song a positive review, stating:
'Curtain Call' opens with similar intensity levels to his previous track, laying his heart on the line over a backdrop of cooing strings as he asks his gal to "lose control with me tonight" with alcohol-infused numbness. Fortunately, his acuteness is countered by an epic, lighter-waving chorus that soars majestically with the aid of Labrinth's sister Sherelle. The result, like a generous dose of morphine, will draw a smile every time. .
