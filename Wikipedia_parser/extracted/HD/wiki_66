Carrion Crawler/The Dream

Carrion Crawler/The Dream is an LP by San Francisco-based garage rock band Thee Oh Sees. It was released on November 8, 2011, by In the Red Records. Despite the running time of the album being comparable or greater than most of their other full-length releases, the vinyl editions state that it is an EP.
Background.
Petey Dammit, the band's bassist, claimed that the album "was completely recorded live. 1, 2, 3, press record, go." Brigid Dawson stated that it was recorded over a five day period. Chris Woodhouse, a frequent collaborator and mix engineer for the band, recorded the album at The Hangar recording studio in Sacramento, CA. John Dwyer, describing the album's sound, said: “As I’m sure most would agree, 'Castlemania' was more of a vocal tirade. This one’s meant to pummel and throb.” The second track is a medley of an original song called "Contraption" with a cover of the song "Soul Desert" by Can. "Contraption" had previously been released as a demo on "Singles Vol. 1 + 2". Lars Finberg of the band The Intelligence joined Thee Oh Sees as a second drummer on this recording. The band dedicated the album to the memory of Jerry Fuchs, Jay Reatard, and Gerard Smith.
The album's title was taken from the titles of the first and sixth songs on the album. A "Carrion Crawler" is a centipede-like monster from the "Dungeons and Dragons" series of roleplaying games. Petey Dammit stated that the album was originally based around "The Dream", but after the band created the song "Carrion Crawler", John Dwyer decided to add its name to the album's title. The songs are completely separate other than their use together as the album's name.
In 2011, Burger Records released a series of cassette tapes by Thee Oh Sees that contained two full-length albums on each cassette. "Carrion Crawler/The Dream" was paired with the band's other main release from 2011, "Castlemania".

Kulasekharapatnam

Kulasekarapatnam (Kulasekharapattinam, Tamil – குலசேகரப்பட்டிணம்) is a town in the Tuticorin district (formerly Tinnelvelly or Tirunelveli of Tamil Nadu, India. Kulasekharapatnam is referred to in Marco Polo's travel diaries dating to 1250 AD. Kulasekharapatnam the name is derived from pandyan ruler Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I.
Kulasekharapatnam was an ancient port dating to the 1st centuries of the Christian era and was contemporaneous to the existence of Kollam, Cheran Port, another Pandyan port. Kollam served the Pandyas on the west coast while Kulasekharapatnam served them on the east coast connecting them to Ceylon and the pearl fisheries in the Gulf of Mannar facing the Tirunelveli Coast. 
Kulasekharapatnam has Muslim settlements. The other ports on the Coromandel Coast were Kaveripumpattinam (Poompuhar) and Arikamedu (near Pondicherry). On the west coast the ancient ports were Kollam and Kodungallur and Barugachha (Broach) in Gujarat.
The famous Mutharamman Temple, which is 300 years old, is located in this place. The ancient port had connections with Sri Lanka. This place lost significance once Tuticorin became a big port. 
Old Harbour mentioned by Marco Polo.
Marco Polo describes the Pandyan port city of Kulasekharapatnam which even now we can see in the seashore of Kulasekharapatnam that Some Pillars which were used to give the right direction for ships as it is at this city that all the ships touch that come from the west, as from Hormos and from Kis and from Aden, and all Arabia, laden with horses and with other things for sale. And this brings a great concourse of people from the country round about, and so there is great business done in this city.
Marakkars & Rowthar Settlement.
Now Kulasekarapatnam has Muslim Population as Marakkars or Marakkayars they were doing trade with Ships, they had come from Kerala, it is said Kunjali Marakkar's family members coming from kerala. In Kulsekarapatnam till 1965 the small ships "Dhoni" operated from there. If one town was a port, it must have had a Light House. Kulasekharapatnam even now has a light house in near Manapad". In Kulasekharapatnam, now even called a part of this town Rawthar Paalyam that Rawthar is called to a section of Muslim that their trade with horses. kulasekharapatnam was also an important trade centre even before the arrival of Islam. Since 8th century AD, This city is inhabited by Muslims belonging to the Dravidian race.
Sugar factory was running very successfully till the end of the British rule. Since the British rule Kulasekharapatnam has customs office. British Railway Line was established and it was called Kulasekharapatnam Light Railway and the stations were Kulasekharapatnam Central, Kulasekharapatnam Port and KPM Sugar factory in 1933.
History of Origin of Marakkars.
Maraicar or Maraicayar, Marakayar, Maraicar is a distinctive Tamil and Malayalam-speaking Muslim people of the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala in India. Let us first look at the name Marakkar. Note that this is different from Marakkayar though we will observe the connections after a while (Marikkar & Maricar are other spellings used in history books). According to many other historians, Moppila or Moplah is Maha Pillai (great son) and Marakkar means (Marakkalam is a wooden boat) ‘boatmen’. Thurston in his Tribes of S India, states the following - The word Marakkar is usually derived from the Arabic ‘Markab’, a boat. The story goes that, when the first immigrants of this class (they were apparently driven from their own country by persecutions) landed on the Indian shores, they were naturally asked who they were, and where they came from. In answer they pointed to their boats, and pronounced the word Markab, and they became in consequence Marakkars, or the people of Markab.
Was it also a titular name for seaborne traders? KVK Iyer clarifies in his history of Kerala that Marakkar was a prized title given by the Zamorin of Calicut. Derived from Marakka Rayar it signifies the captain of a ship Rayar (Captain) of Marakkalam (ship)
Traditionally, the Maricars engaged in mercantile commerce. They can be found along coastal areas of the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu in India. They are generally considered to be of Middle Eastern(Arab) origin.
Most of us have heard and read about the famous Kunhali Marakkar and his exploits, but one question remains, where did they come from? There have been many questions about their real origins, were they Moplahs of Arab extract from Pantalayani Kollam (South of Calicut); were they of Sri Lankan origin, were they Tamil Marakkars or were they from Tulunad? The research was quite interesting and the result obtained cannot be termed fully conclusive but was quite revealing. For those here, and only interested in Kunjali’s story, this does not cover the life and times of any of the famous Kunhali’s but hovers only around theories of their possible origin.
The Maraicars can be found in coastal areas of South India, including Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
Around 12th century AD in Arab countries there was a dispute among two kings who belongs to the same royal family which later erupted in war. The defeated members of the royal family were packed in ships and banished with their captains and servants. Those who settled in coastal regions of India Nadu and Kerala are called marakala rayars, which means wooden boat and RAYAR which means king in the Tamil language. The captains of the ships are called malimars (malumiyar comes from the Tamil word MALUMI and YAR, malumi means captain in Tamil) and the ship crew members are called sherangs. Even today malimars sherangs and Maricars [Marakalrayars are to be found living only on the coast of Tamil Nadu. Maricars can be found abundance in Maraikayar Pattinam (which is thought to be the ancestral hometown of the early Maricars), Parangipettai (Portonovo), Kulasekharapatnam, Kilakarai, Adirampattinam, Muthupet, Nagore, Nagapattinam, Manjakollai and various other coastal towns.
Cheraman Perumal, the ruler of Kerala embraced Islam.
Maraicars in Malabar are descendants of one of the missionaries in the team of twelve sent to Kerala during the time of Prophet Muhammed. It is said that the Maharaja of the then Kerala, Cheraman Perumal went to Arabia and accepted Islam in Mecca. He died there in Mecca and was buried there. While the Maharaja was there, he sent a team of twelve messengers in a ship to Kerala to preach the Islamic principles. The local rulers knew these people are sent by their own Maharaja and received them royally. The missionaries married women from the royal families and settled down in different parts of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The descendants of each of them became a family and one was the Marakkar family. Kunjali Marakkars were the most famous Marakkars among them.
Maricars dealt business with sea trade earlier
According to KVK Iyer, Kunjali after the destruction of Ponnani by Almeida approached the Zamorin and asked to fight the Portuguese. Impressed by his courage he was given this title by the Zamorin. It appears that the people who carried the title used a special silk turban on their heads. Don Lach & Ed Levy quoting Laval in the book ‘Asia in the making of Europe’ states that Marakkar means ‘viceroy’.
NM Nampoothiri quoting the Granthavaris of Calicut - Zamorin confirms the honorific title - In 1687 the Kuliyoti Kottakal Marakkayar was given the title Marakkayar. Another man, Kunnikkalathor was given the title Kunnali Marakkayar in the same year.

Blue Waters, Perth

Blue Waters is a historic private residence located on Canning Highway in Como, Western Australia. The house was built in 1954 by Mabel and Keith Perron. Designed as a "party palace", it became the hub of the Perth social scene for many years.
History.
Shortly before the Second World War, the Perrons were inspired by a magazine illustration of a Florida Art Deco house design. Construction of the 1930s design was delayed until 1954 because of wartime restrictions. Building materials were rationed during the war, and the design of Blue Waters involved a greater quantity of brickwork and glass than the quotas allowed. To overcome the handicap, Keith Perron established a brickworks. Other technical challenges could not be met in Australia, the curved glass windows and frames having to be shipped from the U.K.
The house became both a social hub and a landmark outside which tour buses would regularly pause. On a return trip from Darwin, the Perrons' two young sons brought back two baby crocodiles in a shoe box, and set up a small pond in the backyard for them. One was later donated to the Perth Zoo after venturing outside the property. Daughter Judith had a modelling career and used the house for photographic shoots. A cousin, Marshall Perron lived there for a while as a young man before establishing himself as a Northern Territory politician and chief minister.
In 1961 the house, complete with its original furniture, was sold to Joy and Eric Lillingston for ₤12,500 (A$25,000). In 1965, it was bought by a bookmaker named Bodica, and later by a Mr Sowden who was the deputy mayor of Fremantle. In the 1970s, the Norvillas family acquired it and stayed for 35 years before selling in 2006 to David Cavanagh. Cavanagh contacted the original owners for their advice in restoring the property to its original condition.
The house was listed on the Municipal Heritage Inventory of the City of South Perth in December 1994, affording it a "high level of protection" under the City of South Perth Town Planning Scheme. The statement of significance for the house's registration noted its "aesthetic, representative and rarity cultural heritage significance".
Design.
The building was designed by architect K. D'Alton, and has featured in national reference books on Australian architecture for its interwar design features and its distinctive curved glass windows.

Fifi Young

Fifi Joung (Perfected Spelling: Fifi Young; 12 January 1914 – 5 March 1975) was an Indonesian actress of mixed Chinese and French descent. She acted in at least 86 films over her 34-year career.
Early life and stage career.
Young was born with the name Nonie Tan (Chinese name Tan Kiem Nio) in Sungai Liput, Aceh, on 12 January 1914 to a French father and "peranakan" Chinese mother; her father may have been a serviceman during World War I. After her father died when she was a child, Young and her mother moved to Batavia (modern day Jakarta), where Young completed four years of elementary school at a Dutch-run school for Chinese.
Young first joined the Dewi Dja' troupe as a dancer, using the pseudonym Dewi Maria. She later switched to Miss Riboet's Orion, where she married the playwright Njoo Cheong Seng when she was 14. The elder man coached her in acting and convinced her to take the stage name Fifi Young; Young was the Mandarin equivalent of Njoo's Hokkien surname, while Fifi was meant to be reminiscent of the French actress Fifi D'Orsay. With Miss Riboet, Young travelled throughout South East Asia, including in British Malaya.
In 1930 the couple established the Moonlight Crystal Follies in Penang, where Young had her first acting job. By the mid-1930s Young and Njoo had switched to the Dardanella troupe. Young was one of the group's stars, and after most of the group went abroad Young and Njoo established their own troupe, Fifi Young's Pagoda, in 1937.
Film career.
After the success of Albert Balink's "Terang Boelan" in 1937 and The Teng Chun's "Alang-Alang" in 1939, four new film studios were started. One of these, Oriental Film, signed Njoo and Young; Njoo was taken as a writer, while Young was meant to be an actress. Young was hoped to be the studio's bankable star, and starred in the studio's first three films: "Kris Mataram" ("Kris of Mataram"; 1940), "Zoebaida" (1940), and "Pantjawarna" ("Five Colours"; 1941). When Njoo left the studio to join Majestic Pictures upon the invitation of Fred Young (no relation), Fifi Young went with him. With Majestic she starred in "Air Mata Iboe" ("Mother's Tears"; 1941).
During the Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945, Young and Njoo were members of the Bintang Soerabaia troupe; their fellow member Dhalia had also been a film star before the occupation. The Japanese had closed all but one film studio, essentially killing the industry. During the four-year revolution that followed, Young and her husband led the Pantjawarna troupe.
After the revolution, Young returned to film. During the following two decades she often played mother figures. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that Young performed especially well when acting as an older village woman and that she was well known for chewing betel on-screen.
Young acted in her last film, Teguh Karya's "Ranjang Pengantin" ("Wedding Dress") in 1974. She died on 5 March 1975 after spending several months in the hospital. She was cremated at Muara Karang, North Jakarta, four days after her death, until which she had actively spoke out against the sexually-themed stories that had begun dominating the nation's cinema. Her daughter Sally, one of five children Young had with Njoo before they divorced, went into acting.
Awards.
Young received several acting awards during her career. At the inaugural Indonesian Film Festival in 1955, Young was chosen for the best actress award for her role in "Tarmina". She received several nominations from the PWI, including Best Actress for "Wajah Seorang Pembunuh" in 1973 and Best Actress for "Jembatan Merah" in 1974. In November 2003 Young was posthumously awarded a Budaya Parama Dharma Award by President Megawati Sukarnoputri for her contributions to the development of Indonesian culture. Other awardees included the comedian Bing Slamet and the director D. Djajakusuma.
Filmography.
Young acted in at least 86 films over her 34-year career, saying in 1972 that she had forgotten just how many. Those recorded are as follows:

Gezähe

In German-speaking countries, the miner's toolset is known as a Gezähe (derived from "gizouuun", zu "zawen", "gezawen" – to be usable, advantageous) formerly also abbreviated to "Gezäh". It is a set of personally-owned mining tools and equipment needed by the miner in his daily work.
In coal mining in central Europe during the 19th and 20th centuries, every miner had his own set of tools. So that they could not be stolen, before the end of his shift they were either locked in a tool chest ("Gezähekiste") or threaded onto a tool ring ("Gezähering") which was then locked. To that end, all tools had a hole or eyelet. Tools that were not part of a miner's personal equipment and were only needed now and then, could be issued to the miner in the tool store ("Gezähekammer" or "Magazin") in return for a token ("Gezähemarke"). Most tools were either marked with a number, which was either tapped or welded to tool.

Lucius Octavius

Lucius Octavius (c. 116 – 74 BC) was a Roman politician who was elected consul in 75 BC.
Biography.
A member of the Plebeian gens Octavia, and the son of Gnaeus Octavius (consul in 87 BC), Lucius Octavius was elected Praetor by 78 BC at the latest. He is suspected by the historian Thomas Robert Shannon Broughton to have been the author of the "Formula Octaviana", a law which provided for the restoration of property and money which had been obtained by violent acts, or by threats of violence.
In 75 BC, Lucius Octavius was elected consul alongside Gaius Aurelius Cotta. During the later stages of his consulate, both Lucius Octavius and his colleague were attacked by crowds along the Via Sacra while they were campaigning on behalf of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Creticus’ campaign for the praetorship. Both men had to take refuge in Lucius Octavius’ house.
For his Proconsular governorship, Lucius Octavius was awarded the province of Cilicia by lot. He arrived there in early 74 BC, but died very shortly afterwards, just was the Third Mithridatic War was beginning. His replacement as governor was the consul Lucullus.

Ladislaus Kórógyi

Ladislaus Kórógyi () was bishop of Pécs in the Kingdom of Hungary from 1314 to his death in 1345. He assisted King Charles I of Hungary by force against his opponents, but later he lost royal favor because he energically protected the interests of the Church and his diocese in the Kingdom of Hungary. He actively developed his bishopric's properties, for instance, by inviting colonists to Mohács and Pécs.
Life.
Early career.
Ladislaus Kórógyi was the fourth son of his namesake father, a wealthy nobleman by his second wife. His family's properties were located in the counties of Baranya, Pozsega, Tolna and Valkó. He was first mentioned as a cleric in 1296, and as a canon at the cathedral chapter of Pécs in 1300. Bishop Peter I of Pécs appointed Ladislaus provost of the cathedral chapter at his see. However, both the bishop and his provost were prevented from entering their seat by Nicholas, cantor of the chapter who disputed the validity of Bishop Peter's appointment to bishopric. Ladislaus Kórógyi could only enter his office in June 1310, when the first document under his name was issued by the cathedral chapter.
Bishop of Pécs.
The canons of the cathedral chapter elected Ladislaus bishop of Pécs after the death of Bishop Peter who died in the first half of 1314. The earliest mention of his bishopric is dated to January 17, 1315. He personally assisted King Charles I against the rebelling Kőszegi family in the counties of Baranya and Tolna from April to July 1316, and against the powerful Matthew III Csák in the siege of Komárom (Komárno, Slovakia) in October 1317. However, the peace concluded between the monarch and Matthew Csák scandalized the prelates, because it failed to dispose over the damages caused by the oligarch to them. They held an assembly in Kalocsa in February 1318. Here the archbishop of Esztergom and his suffragan bishops appointed Ladislaus Kórógyi to express all their grievances, including the taxation of Church properties, to the monarch.
Ladislaus Kórógyi was also often appointed by the popes to proceed on behalf of the Holy See with King Charles I who frequently took advantage of vacancies in Church offices in order to seize their income for himself. For instance, Pope John XXII appointed Bishop Ladislaus one of the administrators of the Archdiocese of Esztergom. No doubt, Bishop Ladislaus was one of the authors of an anonymous letter sent in 1338 by Hungarian prelates to the pope which listed their complaints against King Charles I. The monarch in his turn wrote a letter to the pope in order to prevent the appointment of Ladislaus Kórógyi to the archbishopric of Kalocsa. His relationship with the monarch deteriorated to such an extent, that there is no reference to his presence at the royal court after 1330. King Charles I even confiscated the fortresses of Kórógy (Korog, Croatia) and Mecseknádasd and the properties attached to them from the bishop's family. Although Bishop Ladislaus and one of his nephews received some compensation from the monarch, he transferred half of his lands to his relatives.
Bishop Ladislaus invited "guest settlers" to Mohács and granted autonomy to them. He even brought an action against the convent at Somlóvásárhely on the possession of a land near Mohács. He also settled German colonists in Pécs. Although Bishop Ladislaus confirmed the exemption from the tithes of the monastery of Saint James Hill at Pécs, he disputed (in vain) the same status of the Paulines and the Knights Hospitaller in his diocese. However, he succeeded in strengthening his position against the collegiate chapter of Požega whose canons tried to dispute his supervisory right. Three years before his death, Bishop Ladislaus also convinced King Charles I's son and successor, King Louis I of Hungary to return the properties confiscated in the reign of the king's father to his family.

Wars of the Roses (air race)

The Wars of the Roses was an air race organized by the Yorkshire Evening News between the Yorkshire-built Blackburn Type I monoplane and the Lancashire-built Avro 504 biplane which was staged around Leeds on 2 October 1913.
The challenge.
In the summer of 1913 the Lancashire firm of A. V. Roe designed an advanced biplane called the Avro 504. The machine was built in secret and entered into the Aerial Derby, causing a sensation when it arrived at Hendon for the race on 20 September. Piloted by F. P. Raynham, the untried 504 finished fourth in the Derby only two days after its maiden flight.
Following the Derby, Yorkshire's Blackburn Aeroplane and Motor Co. Ltd. challenged Avro to a race between the 504 and the Blackburn Type I, a monoplane which had itself only made its first flight on 14 August 1913. Avro accepted the challenge and on 29 September Raynham flew the 504 from Brooklands to Leeds in preparation for the race.
Prelude to the race.
On 2 October 1913, Henri Salmet displayed his Blériot XI-2, and operated passenger flights during the preparation for the race. The Avro 504 was piloted by Raynham with Avro co-founder Humphrey Verdon Roe (brother of A. V. Roe) as passenger. The Blackburn Type I was piloted by Harold Blackburn (no relation of aircraft designer Robert Blackburn) with the machine's owner, Dr. M. G. Christie, as passenger. The 100-mile course began and ended at Moortown, near Leeds, with control stations at York, Doncaster, Sheffield and Barnsley, at which points the competitors were required to land for 20 minutes. A crowd estimated at 20,000 gathered at Moortown, where both machines made trial flights. There was little wind but mist set in during the course of the race.
The race.
The two contestants took off side by side at 2:14 with the Avro 504 gaining an immediate height advantage. Raynham was first to reach the York control at Bootham Stray, landing at 2:38, with Blackburn one minute behind. Blackburn's departure from York was delayed when a terrier got between the wheels of the monoplane, costing the Yorkshire team a further 10 seconds. However Blackburn recovered to land at the Doncaster control at 3:33, three seconds ahead of Raynham.
Blackburn was again first to land at the Sheffield control, arriving at 4:19, but Raynham landed in the wrong field. By the time the Lancashire team reached the Sheffield control they were four minutes in arrears. Blackburn however was three minutes late taking off from Sheffield, cutting his advantage to one minute as they headed for Barnsley. 
Blackburn landed at Barnsley at 4:55 but, in deteriorating conditions, the Avro crew flew past the control and came down at Dewsbury. Conceding the race, Raynham returned to Leeds, arriving ahead of Blackburn who completed the race at 5:48. The Yorkshire crew received a great ovation and Harold Blackburn was carried shoulder-high from his machine by the partisan crowd.
Speaking after the race, Roe stated that up to Sheffield the two machines “kept pretty well together” while Harold Blackburn admitted they had a geographical advantage over their Lancashire rivals. The silver trophy donated by the Yorkshire Evening News was presented to Dr. Christie who in turn awarded it to Harold Blackburn.
Postscript.
A return match in Lancashire was mooted for later in October 1913 with further plans for making the Wars of the Roses air race an annual event. Neither of these came to fruition.

Denmark participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 in Malmö, Sweden. The Danish entry was selected through the national final Dansk Melodi Grand Prix 2013, organised by the Danish broadcaster Danmarks Radio (DR). Emmelie de Forest represented Denmark with the song "Only Teardrops", which qualified from the first semi-final of the competition and won the contest, placing 1st in the final with 281 points.
Dansk Melodi Grand Prix 2013.
On 28 May 2012, two days after the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 in Azerbaijan, DR announced their intention to participate in the 2013 contest.
The national selection, Dansk Melodi Grand Prix, remained the same as in previous years. A selection jury selected six songs in open competition among the songs submitted to the broadcaster. Additionally, four participants were invited based on editorial considerations. In total, ten songs participated in the national final. Jan Lagermand Lundme, DR Head of Entertainment, said that DR focussed on selecting songs that had a strong chorus.
When the deadline for submitting entries to Dansk Melodi Grand Prix 2013 had passed on 24 September 2012, 692 songs had been received - the highest number of submissions since 1988.
Dansk Melodi Grand Prix 2013 took place on 26 January 2013 at Jyske Bank Boxen in Herning, which has an audience capacity of up to 15,000. The show was presented by Lise Rønne, Louise Wolff and Sofie Lassen-Kahlke.
The winning song was selected in two rounds of voting. In the first round, the combination of viewer SMS voting and a professional jury selected the top 3 songs which proceeded to the superfinal. In the second round, viewers and the professional jury voted again, however, each member of the jury awarded 1, 2, and 3 points to the songs, with 3 points being awarded to the song they preferred the most. The five members of the jury awarded a total of 30 points. The SMS viewer vote was also translated into 30 points, with each song receiving the proportion of those 30 points based on the percentage of the total votes they earned. For example, if a song received 50% of the viewer votes, it would be awarded 15 points. In both voting rounds, the viewer's SMS vote accounted for 50% of the results, while the jury votes accounted for the remaining 50%.
The members of the professional jury were announced on 14 January 2013:
Final.
The ten songs and artists competing in Dansk Melodi Grand Prix were revealed on 16 January 2013. 
The intervals acts that performed during the show were last years winner Soluna Samay, 1980 and 1987 Eurovision Song Contest winner Johnny Logan, 1976 Eurovision Song Contest winners Brotherhood of Man and 1984 Eurovision Song Contest winners Herreys. 
After all ten songs were performed, Simone, Emmelie de Forest and Mohamed Ali were selected as the top 3. Emmelie de Forest won Dansk Melodi Grand Prix with the song "Only Teardrops" after receiving 11 points from the jury and 15 points (50% of the viewer vote) from the public. 
At Eurovision.
To ensure fair ticket distribution in the semifinals, the Eurovision Reference Group decided on 7 November 2012 that Denmark would compete in the first semi-final on 14 May. In the first semifinal, the producers of the show decided that Denmark would perform 5th, following Croatia and preceding Russia. On stage, Emmelie de Forest was joined by two drummers: Morten Specht Larsen and Jacob Baagøe Thomsen, and by three backing singers: Anne Murillo, Heidi Degn and Anders Øhrstrøm.
Denmark qualified from the first semi-final, placing 1st and scoring 167 points. At the first semi-final winners' press conference, Denmark was allocated to perform in the second half of the final. In the final, the producers of the show decided that Denmark would perform 18th, following Hungary and preceding Iceland. Denmark won the 2013 Contest placing 1st and scoring 281 points.
In Denmark, both the semi-finals and the final were broadcast on DR1, with commentary provided by Ole Tøpholm.

Juniper shield bug

The juniper shield bug, Cyphostethus tristriatus (Fieber, 1860), (family: Acanthosomatidae), is a large (9-10.5 mm) green shield bug with distinctive pinkish-red markings on the corium.
The bug's traditional foodplant is juniper, with the larvae feeding on juniper berries. It has also adapted to use Lawson cypress ("Chamaecyparis" spp.) as a host. In the United Kingdom it was formerly scarce and restricted largely to southern juniper woodlands but in recent years it has become common across southern and central England as a result of the widespread garden planting of juniper and cypress. Recent discoveries on stands of juniper in northern England and Scotland suggest that the range of the species may be extending.
The juniper shield bug is active for most of the year apart from the coldest months. It overwinters as an adult, emerging to mate in the early spring. New adults may be found from late August onwards.

Normal (New Girl)

"Normal" is the twentieth episode of the first season of the American comedy television series "New Girl". It was written by Luvh Rakhe and directed by Jesse Peretz.
Synopsis.
Jess (Zooey Deschanel) brings her new boyfriend Russell (Dermot Mulroney) home to the loft to meet her roommates. After some reluctance, the men bond when the group plays True American, an active drinking game. The game ends when Cece (Hannah Simone) retreats to Schmidt's bed, prompting Schmidt (Max Greenfield) to join her. Nick (Jake Johnson) then shares his idea for "real apps," a suite of physical "apps" for smartphones with functionality similar to a Swiss Army knife. He accidentally wounds Russell with the prototype, prompting Russell to leave, to Jess's disappointment.
Winston (Lamorne Morris) begins a new job in "Normal" as an assistant to sports talk show host Joe Napoli (Phil Hendrie). Winston's initial enthusiasm for the job fades when he realizes Napoli is an abrasive and disrespectful boss. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has a cameo appearance as a guest on Napoli's show.
"True American".
After "Normal" aired, internet sources began to summarize the rules for "True American", which the characters described as a mix of a drinking game and Candy Land where the floor is lava; it also involves shouting the names of American presidents. The idea of "True American" came from a "New Girl" writer who played a similar game in college. As she could not remember the game's exact rules, the writers focused on making the game as funny on the page as possible, but only established chanting "JFK! FDR!" and walking on chairs. As the cast did not understand the game during shooting, the writers created more rules on the spot, advised the actors to "have fun, dig in, jump in" and play it as if "they'd been playing this thing for years and years and years." The high-energy feel of the game and the amounts of coverage made filming "True American" more challenging for the actors than normal episodes. Producers Dave Finkel, Brett Baer, and writer Luvh Rakhe, came up with most of the obscure American history facts, but much was cut from the finished episode. Fox subsequently released a set of official rules for the game, which can be summarized "There are no real rules". The characters also played "True American" in "Cooler", the 15th episode of the second season, and in "Mars Landing", the 20th episode of the third season.
Reception.
The initial broadcast of "Normal" attracted 5.23 million US viewers. "The A.V. Club" called the episode "the young series at its best," rating it an A- overall. The staff of "The Atlantic" included it in their list of the best TV episodes of 2012, comparing the actors' performances to "the best sitcom ensembles" of "Seinfeld", "Will & Grace", and "Friends". Alan Sepinwall said the episode "didn't seem quite as effortlessly hilarious as several recent episodes" but was still enjoyable.

MSW Votec 221

The MSW Votec 221 is a single engine, single seat kitbuilt light-sport aircraft, designed and built in Switzerland.
Design and development.
The Votec 221 is a single seat, low wing monoplane, designed for engines in the power range 90-180 kW (120-240 hp). The first prototype, completed in 2009, has a 157 kW (210 hp) Lycoming AEIO-390 flat-four engine and the second, finished the following year, a 134 kW (180 hp) engine. MSW's numerical designation has two digits indicating power in hp/10, followed by the number of seats, suggesting an optimum 220 hp power unit.
Externally, the Votec 221 resembles a scaled down (span, 80%) MSW Votec 351. It has low aspect ratio straight tapered wings with blunt, almost square tips. Ailerons are assisted by external spades. The empennage is also straight tapered, with a forward set tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage, far enough forward on the fin to require only a small cut-out for movement of the deep rudder. Both elevators have trim tabs and the rudder is horn balanced. The cockpit, placed over the wing, is covered with a single piece, starboard hinged canopy. Like the Votec 351, the 321 has a conventional undercarriage. The mainwheels are mounted on curved, sprung cantilever legs and enclosed by long fairings. It has a steerable tailwheel on a long cantilever.
Operational history.
The first prototype is Swiss-registered and the second German, the latter appearing at Aero 2011, held at Friedrichshafen that April. First flight dates were not released by late 2011 but the first prototype was certainly flying by late May 2012. A full scale non-flying mock up has also been exhibited.

Shrimp

The term shrimp is used to refer to some decapod crustaceans, although the exact animals covered can vary. Used broadly, it may cover any of the groups with elongated bodies and a primarily swimming mode of locomotion – chiefly Caridea and Dendrobranchiata. In some fields, however, the term is used more narrowly, and may be restricted to Caridea, to smaller species of either group, or to only the marine species. Under the broader definition, "shrimp" may be synonymous with "prawn", covering stalk-eyed swimming crustaceans with long narrow muscular tails (abdomens), long whiskers (antennae) and slender legs. They swim forwards by paddling with swimmerets on the underside of their abdomens. Crabs and lobsters have strong walking legs, whereas shrimp have thin fragile legs which they use primarily for perching.
Shrimp are widespread and abundant. They can be found feeding near the seafloor on most coasts and estuaries, as well as in rivers and lakes. To escape predators, some species flip off the seafloor and dive into the sediment. They usually live from one to seven years. Shrimp are often solitary, though they can form large schools during the spawning season. There are thousands of species, and usually there is a species adapted to any particular habitat. Any small crustacean which resembles a shrimp tends to be called one.
They play important roles in the food chain and are important food sources for larger animals from fish to whales. The muscular tails of shrimp can be delicious to eat, and they are widely caught and farmed for human consumption. Commercial shrimp species support an industry worth 50 billion dollars a year, and in 2010 the total commercial production of shrimp was nearly 7 million tonnes (see production chart below). Shrimp farming took off during the 1980s, particularly in China, and by 2007 the harvest from shrimp farms exceeded the capture of wild shrimp. There are significant issues with excessive bycatch when shrimp are captured in the wild, and with pollution damage done to estuaries when they are used to support shrimp farming. Many shrimp species are small as the term "shrimp" suggests, about long, but some shrimp exceed . Larger shrimp are more likely to be targeted commercially, and are often referred to as "prawns", particularly in Britain.
Classification.
Shrimp are swimming crustaceans with long narrow muscular abdomens and long antennae. Unlike crabs and lobsters, shrimp have well developed pleopods (swimmerets) and slender walking legs; they are more adapted for swimming than walking. Historically, it was the distinction between walking and swimming that formed the primary taxonomic division into the former suborders Natantia and Reptantia. Members of the Natantia (shrimp in the broader sense) were adapted for swimming while the Reptantia (crabs, lobsters, etc.) were adapted for crawling or walking. Some other groups also have common names that include the word "shrimp"; any small swimming crustacean resembling a shrimp tends to be called one.
Description.
The diagram on the right and the following description refers mainly to the external anatomy of the common European shrimp, "Crangon crangon", as a typical example of a decapod shrimp. The body of the shrimp is divided into two main parts: the head and thorax which are fused together to form the cephalothorax, and a long narrow abdomen. The shell which protects the cephlathorax is harder and thicker than the shell elsewhere on the shrimp, and is called the carapace. The carapace typically surrounds the gills, through which water is pumped by the action of the mouthparts. The rostrum, eyes, whiskers and legs also issue from the carapace. The rostrum, from the Latin "rōstrum" meaning "beak", looks like a beak or pointed nose at the front of the shrimp's head. It is a rigid forward extension of the carapace, and can be used for attack or defence. It may also stabilize the shrimp when it swims backwards. Two bulbous eyes on stalks sit either side of the rostrum. These are compound eyes which have panoramic vision and are very good at detecting movement. Two pairs of whiskers (antennae) also issue from the head. One of these pairs is very long, and can be twice the length of the shrimp, while the other pair are quite short. The antennae have sensors on them which allow the shrimp to feel where they touch, and also allow them to "smell" or "taste" things by sampling the chemicals in the water. The long antennae help the shrimp orientate itself with regard to its immediate surroundings, while the short antennae help assess the suitability of prey.
Eight pairs of appendages issue from the cephlathorax. The first three pairs, the maxillipeds, Latin for "jaw feet", are used as mouthparts. In "Crangon crangon", the first pair, the maxillula, pumps water into the gill cavity. After the maxilliped come more five pairs of appendages, the pereiopods. These form the ten decapod legs. In "Crangon crangon", the first two pairs of pereiopods have claws or chela. The chela can grasp food items and bring them to the mouth. They can also be used for fighting and grooming. The remaining six legs are long and slender, and are used for walking or perching.
The muscular abdomen has six segments and has a thinner shell than the carapace. Each segment has a separate overlapping shell, which can be transparent. The first five segments each have a pair of appendages on the underside, which are shaped like paddles and are used for swimming forward. The appendices are called pleopods or swimmerets, and can be used for more purposes than just swimming. Some shrimp species use them for brooding eggs, others have gills on them for breathing, and the males in some species use the first pair or two for insemination. The sixth segment terminates in the telson flanked by two pairs of appendages called the uropods. The uropods allow the shrimp to swim backwards, and function like rudders, steering the shrimp when it swims forward. Together, the telson and uropods form a splayed tail fan. If a shrimp is alarmed, it can flex its tail fan in a rapid movement. This results in a backward dart called the caridoid escape reaction (lobstering).
Habitat.
Shrimp are widespread, and can be found near the seafloor of most coasts and estuaries, as well as in rivers and lakes. There are numerous species, and usually there is a species adapted to any particular habitat. Most shrimp species are marine, although about a quarter of the described species are found in fresh water. Marine species are found at depths of up to , and from the tropics to the polar regions.
Behaviour.
There are many variations in the ways different types of shrimp look and behave. Even within the core group of caridean shrimp, the small delicate Pederson's shrimp (above) looks and behaves quite unlike the large commercial pink shrimp or the snapping pistol shrimp. The caridean family of pistol shrimp are characterized by big asymmetrical claws, the larger of which can produce a loud snapping sound. The family is diverse and worldwide in distribution, consisting of about 600 species. Colonies of snapping shrimp are a major source of noise in the ocean and can interfere with sonar and underwater communication. The small emperor shrimp has a symbiotic relationship with sea slugs and sea cucumbers, and may help keep them clear of ectoparasites.
Most shrimp are omnivorous, but some are specialised for particular modes of feeding. Some are filter feeders, using their setose (bristly) legs as a sieve; some scrape algae from rocks. Cleaner shrimp feed on the parasites and necrotic tissue of the reef fish they groom. In turn, shrimp are eaten by various animals, particularly fish and seabirds, and frequently host bopyrid parasites.
Species.
Decapods.
There is little agreement among taxonomists concerning the phylogeny of crustaceans. Within the decapods "every study gives totally different results. Nor do even one of these studies match any of the rival morphology studies". Some taxonomists identify shrimp with the infraorder Caridea and prawns with the suborder Dendrobranchiata. While different experts give different answers, there is no disagreement that the caridean species are shrimp. There are over 3000 caridean species. Occasionally they are referred to as "true shrimp".
Traditionally decapods were divided into two suborders: The Natantia or swimmers, and the Reptantia or walkers. The Natantia or swimmers included the shrimp. They were defined by their abdomen which, together with its appendages was well adapted for swimming. The Reptantia or walkers included the crabs and lobsters. These species have small abdominal appendages, but robust legs well adapted for walking. The Natantia was thought to be paraphyletic, that is, it was thought that originally all decapods were like shrimp.
However, classifications are now based on clades, and the paraphyletic suborder Natantia has been discontinued. "On this basis, taxonomic classifications now divide the order Decapoda into the two suborders: Dendrobranchiata for the largest shrimp clade, and Pleocyemata for all other decapods. The Pleocyemata are in turn divided into half a dozen infra-orders"
Other decapod crustaceans also called shrimp, are the ghost or mud shrimp belonging to the infra-order Thalassinidea. In Australia they are called "yabbies". The monophyly of the group is not certain; recent studies have suggested dividing the group into two infraorders, Gebiidea and Axiidea.
Non decapods.
A wide variety of non decapod crustaceans are also commonly referred to as shrimp. This includes the brine shrimp, clam shrimp, fairy shrimp and tadpole shrimp belonging to the branchiopods, the lophogastridan shrimp, opossum shrimp and skeleton shrimp belonging the Malacostraca; and seed shrimp which are ostracods. Many of these species look quite unlike like the commercial decapod shrimp that are eaten as seafood. For example, skeleton shrimp have short legs and a slender tail like a scorpion tail, fairy shrimp swim upside down with swimming appendages that look like leaves, and the tiny seed shrimp have bivalved carapaces which they can open or close. Krill resemble miniature shrimp, and are sometimes called "krill shrimp".
Some mantis shrimp are a foot long, and have bulging eyes, a flattened tail and formidable claws equipped with clubs or sharp spikes, which it can use to knock out its opponents.
Human uses.
History.
In 1991, archeologists suggested that ancient raised paved areas near the coast in Chiapas, Mexico, were platforms used for drying shrimp in the sun, and that adjacent clay hearths were used to dry the shrimp when there was no sun. The evidence was circumstantial, because the chitinous shells of shrimp are so thin they degrade rapidly, leaving no fossil remains. In 1985 Quitmyer and others found direct evidence dating back to 600 AD for shrimping off the southeastern coast of North America, by successfully identifying shrimp from the archaeological remains of their mandibles (jaws). Clay vessels with shrimp decorations have been found in the ruins of Pompeii. In the 3rd century AD, the Greek author Athenaeus wrote in his literary work, "Deipnosophistae"; "... of all fish the daintiest is a young shrimp in fig leaves."
In North America, Native Americans captured shrimp and other crustaceans in fishing weirs and traps made from branches and Spanish moss, or used nets woven with fibre beaten from plants. At the same time early European settlers, oblivious to the "protein-rich coasts" all about them, starved from lack of protein. In 1735 beach seines were imported from France, and Cajun fishermen in Louisiana started catching white shrimp and drying them in the sun, as they still do today. In the mid nineteenth century, Chinese immigrants arrived for the California Gold Rush, many from the Pearl River Delta where netting small shrimp had been a tradition for centuries. Some immigrants starting catching shrimp local to San Francisco Bay, particularly the small inch long "Crangon franciscorum". These shrimp burrow into the sand to hide, and can be present in high numbers without appearing to be so. The catch was dried in the sun and was exported to China or sold to the Chinese community in the United States. This was the beginning of the American shrimping industry. Overfishing and pollution from gold mine tailings resulted in the decline of the fishery. It was replaced by a penaeid white shrimp fishery on the South Atlantic and Gulf coasts. These shrimp were so abundant that beaches were piled with windrows from their moults. Modern industrial shrimping methods originated in this area.
""For shrimp to develop into one of the world's most popular foods, it took the simultaneous development of the otter trawl... and the internal combustion engine." Shrimp trawling can capture shrimp in huge volumes by dragging a net along the seafloor. Trawling was first recorded in England in 1376, when King Edward III received a request that he ban this new and destructive way of fishing. In 1583, the Dutch banned shrimp trawling in estuaries.
In the 1920s, diesel engine were adapted for use in shrimp boats. Power winches were connected to the engines, and only small crews were needed to rapidly lift heavy nets on board and empty them. Shrimp boats became larger, faster, and more capable. New fishing grounds could be explored, trawls could be deployed in deeper offshore waters, and shrimp could be tracked and caught round the year, instead of seasonally as in earlier times. Larger boats trawled offshore and smaller boats worked bays and estuaries. By the 1960s, steel and fibreglass hulls further strengthened shrimp boats, so they could trawl heavier nets, and steady advances in electronics, radar, sonar, and GPS resulted in more sophisticated and capable shrimp fleets.
As shrimp fishing methods industrialised, parallel changes were happening in the way shrimp were processed. "In the 19th century, sun dried shrimp were largely replaced by canneries. In the 20th century, the canneries were replaced with freezers."
In the 1970s, significant shrimp farming was initiated, particularly in China. The farming accelerated during the 1980s as demand for shrimp exceeded supply, and as excessive bycatch and threats to endangered sea turtle became associated with trawling for wild shrimp. In 2007, the production of farmed shrimp exceeded the capture of wild shrimp.
Commercial species.
Although there are thousands of species of shrimp worldwide, only about 20 of these species are commercially significant. The following table contains the principal commercial shrimp, the seven most harvested species. All of them are decapods; most of them belong to the Dendrobranchiata and four of them are penaeid shrimp.
Fishing.
Commercial techniques for catching wild shrimp include otter trawls, seines and shrimp baiting. A system of nets is used when trawling. Baited traps are common in parts of the Pacific Northwest.
Shrimp trawling can result in very high incidental catch rates of non-target species. In 1997, the FAO found discard rates up to 20 pounds for every pound of shrimp. The world average was 5.7 pounds for every pound of shrimp. Trawl nets in general, and shrimp trawls in particular, have been identified as sources of mortality for species of finfish and cetaceans. Bycatch is often discarded dead or dying by the time it is returned to the sea, and may alter the ecological balance in discarded regions. Worldwide, shrimp trawl fisheries generate about 2% of the world's catch of fish in weight, but result in more than one third of the global bycatch total.
The most extensively fished species are the akiami paste shrimp, the northern prawn, the southern rough shrimp, and the giant tiger prawn. Together these four species account for nearly half of the total wild capture. In recent years, the global capture of wild shrimp has been overtaken by the harvest from farmed shrimp.
Farming.
A shrimp farm is an aquaculture business for the cultivation of marine shrimp or prawns for human consumption. Commercial shrimp farming began in the 1970s, and production grew steeply, particularly to match the market demands of the United States, Japan and Western Europe. The total global production of farmed shrimp reached more than 1.6 million tonnes in 2003, representing a value of nearly 9 billion U.S. dollars. About 75% of farmed shrimp are produced in Asia, in particular in China, Thailand and in the Philippines. The other 25% are produced mainly in Latin America, where Brazil is the largest producer. The largest exporting nation is Thailand.
As can be seen from the global production chart on the left, significant aquaculture production started slowly in the 1970s and then rapidly expanded during the 1980s. After a lull in growth during the 1990s, due to pathogens, production took off again and by 2007 exceeded the capture from wild fisheries. By 2010, the aquaculture harvest was 3.9 million tonnes, compared to 3.1 million tonnes for the capture of wild shrimp.
In the earlier years of marine shrimp farming the preferred species was the large giant tiger prawn. This species is reared in circular holding tanks where they think they are in the open ocean, and swim in "never ending migration" around the circumference of the tank. In 2000, global production was 630,984 tonnes, compared to only 146,362 tonnes for whiteleg shrimp. Subsequently these positions reversed, and by 2010 the production of giant tiger prawn increased modestly to 781,581 tonnes while whiteleg shrimp rocketed nearly twenty-fold to 2,720,929 tonnes. The whiteleg shrimp is currently the dominant species in shrimp farming. It is a moderately large shrimp reaching a total length of 230 mm (9"), and is particularly suited to farming because it "breeds well in captivity, can be stocked at small sizes, grows fast and at uniform rates, has comparatively low protein requirements... and adapts well to variable environmental conditions." In China, prawns are cultured along with sea cucumbers and some fish species, in integrated multi-trophic systems.
The major producer of farmed shrimp is China. Other significant producers are Thailand, Indonesia, India, Vietnam, Brazil, Ecuador and Bangladesh. Most farmed shrimp is exported to the United States, the European Union and Japan. 
An investigation by "The Guardian " in 2014 found human rights abuses on fishing boats operated by Thailand. The boats are manned with slaves, and provide fish for the production of fishmeal which is fed to farmed prawns. Greenpeace has challenged the sustainability of tropical shrimp farming practices on the grounds that farming these species "has led to the destruction of vast areas of mangroves in several countries over-fishing of juvenile shrimp from the wild to supply farms." Greenpeace has placed a number of the prominent tropical shrimp species that are farmed commercially on its seafood red list, including the whiteleg shrimp, Indian prawn and giant tiger shrimp.
As food.
Shrimp are marketed and commercialized with several issues in mind. Most shrimp are sold frozen and marketed based on their categorization of presentation, grading, colour, and uniformity. Shrimp have high levels of omega-3 fatty acids and low levels of mercury. Usually shrimp is sold whole, though sometimes only the meat of shrimp is marketed.
As with other seafood, shrimp is high in calcium, iodine and protein but low in food energy. A shrimp-based meal is also a significant source of cholesterol, from 122 mg to 251 mg per 100 g of shrimp, depending on the method of preparation. Shrimp consumption, however, is considered healthy for the circulatory system because the lack of significant levels of saturated fat in shrimp means that the high cholesterol content in shrimp actually improves the ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol and lowers triglycerides.
Shrimp and other shellfish are among the most common food allergens. They are not kosher and thus are forbidden in Jewish cuisine. Shrimp are halal according to some madhāhib, and therefore permissible to most, but not all, Muslims.
Aquaria.
Several types of shrimp are kept in home aquaria. Some are purely ornamental, while others are useful in controlling algae and removing debris. Freshwater shrimp commonly available for aquaria include the Bamboo shrimp, Japanese marsh shrimp ("Caridina multidentata," also called "Amano shrimp," as their use in aquaria was pioneered by Takashi Amano), cherry shrimp ("Neocaridina heteropoda"), and ghost or glass shrimp ("Palaemonetes" spp.). Popular saltwater shrimp include the cleaner shrimp "Lysmata amboinensis", the fire shrimp ("Lysmata debelius") and the harlequin shrimp ("Hymenocera picta").
Shrimp versus prawn.
The terms "shrimp" and "prawn" are common names, not scientific names. They are vernacular or colloquial terms which lack the formal definition of scientific terms. They are not taxa, but are terms of convenience with little circumscriptional significance. There is no reason to avoid using the terms shrimp or prawn when convenient, but it is important not to confuse them with the names or relationships of actual taxa.
According to the crustacean taxonomist Tin-Yam Chan, "The terms "shrimp" and "prawn" have no definite reference to any known taxonomic groups. Although the term "shrimp" is sometimes applied to smaller species, while "prawn" is more often used for larger forms, there is no clear distinction between both terms and their usage is often confused or even reverse in different countries or regions."
A lot of confusion surrounds the scope of the term "shrimp". Part of the confusion originates with the association of smallness. That creates problems with shrimp-like species that are not small. The expression "jumbo shrimp" can be viewed as an oxymoron, a problem that doesn't exist with the commercial designation "jumbo prawns".
The term "shrimp" originated around the 14th century with the Middle English ', akin to the Middle Low German ', and meaning to contract or wrinkle; and the Old Norse "", meaning to shrivel up. It is not clear where the term "prawn" originated, but early forms of the word surfaced in England in the early 15th century as "prayne, praine" and "prane". According to the linguist Anatoly Liberman it is unclear how "shrimp", in English, came to be associated with "small". "No Germanic language associates the shrimp with its size... The same holds for Romance... it remains unclear in what circumstances the name was applied to the crustacean."
Taxonomic studies in European on shrimp and prawns were shaped by the common shrimp and the common prawn, both found in huge numbers along the European coastlines. The common shrimp, "Crangon crangon" was categorised in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus, and the common prawn was categorised in 1777 by Thomas Pennant. The common shrimp is a small burrowing species aligned with the notion of a shrimp as being something small, whereas the common prawn is much larger. The terms "true shrimp" or "true prawn" are sometimes used to mean what a particular person thinks is a shrimp or prawn. This varies with the person using the terms. But such terms are not normally used in the scientific literature, because the terms shrimp and prawn themselves lack scientific standing. Over the years the way shrimp and prawn are used has changed, and nowadays the terms are almost interchangeable. Although from time to time some biologists declare certain common names should be confined to specific taxa, the popular use of these names seems to continue unchanged.
Miscellanea.
Only 57 exclusively fossil species are known in the shrimp fossil record. The earliest date from the Lower Jurassic and Cretaceous.
Various coastal settlements in the United States have claimed the title "Shrimp Capital of the World". For example, the claim was made earlier in the nineteenth century for the Port of Brunswick in Georgia, and Fernandina and Saint Augustine in Florida. More recent claims have been made for Aransas Pass and Brownsville in Texas, as well as Morgan City in Louisiana. The claim has also been made for Mazatlán in Mexico.

Aadi (Telugu actor)

Aadi (born Aditya Pudipeddi) is an Indian actor who primarily works in Telugu cinema. He is the son of popular Indian actor Sai Kumar and made his film debut in 2011 with the film "Prema Kavali" under the direction of K. Vijaya Bhaskar. The film garnered critical acclaim for Aadi and placed him among the noted upcoming actors. He won the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut – South for 2011.
Early life.
Aadi did his schooling in Chennai in Padma Sheshadri till 7th standard and then moved to St Andrews in Hyderabad followed by St Johns for Intermediate and Bhavans for Degree. Though he had an inclination towards acting, he had to concentrate on studies and sports. Being an all-rounder in Cricket, he was selected for under-19 Ranji Cricket Team. He played under the captaincy of Ambati Rayudu, the climax being Pragyan Ojha, the Indian Team player who was his room-mate during their Sri Lanka trip.
When his father Saikumar arranged KALA (Karnataka Andhra Lalithakala Academy), Aadi, being a fan of Chiranjeevi, wanted to dance before Chiranjeevi, who was the chief guest for that function. After gaining consent from his father, he performed to the song "Kodithe Kottalira" from Chiranjeevi-starrer Tagore. Chiranjeevi was impressed with Aadi's performance and advised Saikumar to make him an actor if he desired to be. Ravi Kumar Chavali, who was working with Saikumar for Samanyudu at that time, suggested Aadi to Dr. Venkat, who promised to launch Aadi as actor in the future. That made Aadi foray into films after extensive training in dance, acting and fights.
Career.
Aadi debuted in 2011 with K. Vijaya Bhaskar's directorial Prema Kavali. In this love story, he played the role of Srinu, a NCC Cadet who sets out to find the one who tortures his lover, thus trying to regain her heart after a breakup. He got highly positive response from the critics as well as the audience. Oneindia Entertainment commented on his performance stating "Aadi has done his role with good ease and his in dialogue delivery is as good as his father. He is quite comfortable in emoting the love and emotional scenes and he is also good at dances and action scenes. However, he should further improve his body language, as he appeared a little rigid in some scenes. But for a debutant hero, such situations are unavoidable." GreatAndhra.com too commented on his performance stating "Aadi has made a confident debut. He has built a sturdy physique, nice dance moves, expressive body language and above all, a voice and facial countenance that reminds his father. He passed the debut test without any hassles." Aadi has won the Hyderabad Times award 2011 for Promising Newcomer Male, CineMAA Awards (2012) for best Debut Actor of 2012 and Filmfare Awards South (2012) for Best Male Debut - South of 2011. It ran for 100 days and was declared a Blockbuster.
His next release was B. Jaya's directorial Lovely, which released on March 30, 2012. He played the role of Akash, a jovial person who hates father-daughter relationship, but starts respecting it after he meets with the father of the girl he loved. His performance was highly praised by critics. 123telugu.com commented on his performance stating "Aadi has improved tremendously over his first film and he is impressive in songs and action sequences. He is now more at ease in emotional scenes and he will do well if he keeps working on it." The film was also a blockbuster, completing 100 days run on July 7, 2012 in 12 centres.
However in 2013, Aadi had his first debacle. He starred in G. Ashok's directorial Sukumarudu which released on May 4, 2013 to negative reviews panning the movie's length and bad film making. He played the role of Sukumar, a greedy and selfish NRI who comes to his village in India to own his property under the disguise of meeting his grand mother who later turns a responsible person who understands the value of family, similar to the role played by Nagarjuna in Greeku Veerudu. He was acclaimed for his performance. Zee News commented on his performance stating "After two back-to-back hits, Aadi rises again in a tailor-made role and proves his mettle as an actor. He shoulders his role with panache and conviction, while trying to strike a balance between comedy and action." Currently, he is working for the movie Rough, directed by C. H. Subba Reddy.

Friedrich Eckenfelder

Friedrich Eckenfelder (6 March 1861 – 11 May 1938) was a Swiss-German impressionist painter, best known for his portrayals of farm horses and for townscapes with a background of the Swabian Alps. He was born and raised in modest circumstances, but his talent was discovered at an early age, so that he was able to receive training as a painter and later to enroll in the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. There he became one of the founding members of the Munich Secession.
Eckenfelder's preferred choice of subject emerged early on. By 1878, at the end of his basic education, he was referred to in a document as an "animal painter". After the First World War and the resulting changes in society and art, Eckenfelder moved back to Swabia. He was named an honorary citizen of Balingen in 1928, a street was named for him in 1931, a gallery devoted to his work was established in the town museum in 1978, and the banqueting hall of the town community centre was named in his honour.
Biography.
Youth.
Friedrich Eckenfelder was born in Bern, the second child of the housekeeper Rosina Vivian and the shoemaker Johann Friedrich Eckenfelder, who had moved from Balingen to Basel when he was appointed journeyman shoemaker in 1859 and there met his future wife. They moved together to Bern while still unmarried, then when Rosina was again pregnant in 1865, the family moved to Balingen and they were married there on 18 July 1865. The children were declared legitimate through marriage and declared citicens of Württemberg through their mother. The boy's talent for drawing was discovered in elementary school and advanced training was recommended, which he received from 1875 in Professor Oskar Hölder's drawing class in Rottweil.
The fourteen-year-old boy was raised in Rottweil at his teacher's home as well as with the family of a senior forestry official named Junginger, one of Hölder's friends. There he met Marie Junginger, fourteen years his senior, who was working as a portrait painter after training with Hölder. Eckenfelder and Junginger went to Munich together in 1878, and Eckenfelder began his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in October. In late December 1878, Maria became pregnant. She gave birth to their son Friedrich Junginger on 19 September 1879 in Munich. Eckenfelder's family tried to conceal this "misstep", from the age of six months, the boy was raised by his grandparents, as if he were their own child. The younger Friedrich was deeply affected when he was eventually told that the man he had had a brotherly relationship with was in fact his father.
In Munich.
Marie Junginger and Friedrich Eckenfelder lived in close proximity in Munich, sometimes together. Eckenfelder's biographer Walter Schnerring notes an increasing alienation. In 1899, their son received a position as a bookseller in Stuttgart, Marie Junginger moved to be with him, with her now widowed mother. From 1904 on, when Marie moved away, the contact between Eckenfelder and her was severed. However, she remained in contact with her son, who later opened a bookshop in Arosa, until his death in 1927.
Eckenfelder lived in the artists' quarter of Munich, Maxvorstadt, sharing quarters with Bernhard Buttersack. Christian Landenberger lived on the opposite side of the staircase. Paul Burmester, Georg Jauss, Richard Winternitz and Gino von Finetti moved in the same circle, as well as the "Schwabenburg" (Swabian castle) and the atelier of the painters Anton Braith and Christian Mali. Their meeting place was the "Arzberger Keller" (Arzbergian basement).
Notable teachers at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts at the time were Carl Theodor von Piloty, Wilhelm von Diez, Ludwig von Löfftz and Wilhelm von Lindenschmit the Younger. In addition, Eckenfelder was the first private pupil of Heinrich von Zügel. The latter was also a pupil of Hölder; their relationship was a "... mixture of teacher/pupil, friendship and father/son relationship." Eckenfelder also had contact with his family on excursions to the Dachau Marsh for painting "En plein air" or on autumn visits to Zügel's home town of Murrhardt. Eckenfelder was not part of the class when Zügel began his academy career. The intensive teacher–pupil relationship existed only in private gatherings and meetings. Zügel took an interest in Eckenfelder's economic situation. He tried to provide Eckenfelder with a professorship at the academy, but failed because of the latter's introversion. Both artists were members of the artists' society Allotria and in 1892 founding members of the Munich Secession. Eckenfelder showed two horse paintings at the founding exhibition in 1888, and at the exhibitions in 1896, 1899, 1903, 1906 and 1911.
Already in 1883, Eckenfelder had exhibited his "Überschwemmung im Neckarthal" (Flooding in the Neckar Valley) at the international art exhibition in the Glaspalast in Munich. Prince Regent Luitpold of Bavaria purchased his painting "Pferde vor dem Pflug" (Ploughing Horses) in 1888 and Eckenfelder was for the first time mentioned in the specialist press. The prince regent took a lively interest in the artistic life of Munich and through such acquisitions supported young artists not only financially, but also with the renown they entailed. He often visited painters in their studios. When he paid his first such visit to Eckenfelder, it was a cold day and the artist was wrapped up against the cold and wearing thick winter slippers; Eckenfelder was so embarrassed that soon after he formed the habit of wearing dress shoes and a suit with no smock when working. He maintained this habit until late in life.
Eckenfelder earned the Gold Medal, Second Class, in 1909 for "Schimmel in der Schwemme" (Greys in the Pond). One critic remarked: "Friedrich Eckenfelder's "Greys in the Pond" prove that not everything needs to be painted in adherence with the Zügel school to have effect and power." In 1913, he showed "Pferdemarkt" (Horse Market) at the international exhibition in the Glaspalast. He also participated in exhibitions in Berlin, Frankfurt, Wiesbaden and Stuttgart. Buyouts by the King of Württemberg further increased his market value. His pictures suited the contemporary taste and sold well, partly through Munich dealers, but also through Goldschmid in Frankfurt, Hermes in Wiesbaden, Schaller und Fleischhauer in Stuttgart and dealers in Mainz, Düsseldorf and Berlin. Sometimes he sold his paintings for cash, directly off the easel.
In the 1890s, as more and more of his fellow artists were moving away from Munich, Eckenfelder decided to spend summers in Balingen and in the Swabian Alps. Sketches and paintings were then transported to Munich in the autumn to be presented to friends, colleagues and customers. This was the period of his greatest artistic independence.
Homeland paintings in Balingen.
In contrast, his biographer, Schnerring, describes Eckenfelder's eventual final move to Balingen in 1922 as a withdrawal. The collapse of the monarchy and his friend Zügel's dismissal from his post as director of the Academy by the Bavarian Soviet Republic badly affected Eckenfelder, who was now in his sixties and in poor health. He did not further participate in the "New Secession" or the "Blue Rider". He entered a comfortable retirement in Balingen, looked after by his sister Rosine Wagner. He enjoyed a good reputation in the town; owning one of his paintings was a status symbol for the established families:
The horse picture in the best room was seen as an artistic representation of one's own roots in the Swabian Alps and one's own character as a profound kind of person who consistently ploughs a straight line through life, as the simple denizen of the Swabian Alps might think of himself, but could never have expressed like this painter.
He had his local patrons and was known to all, since he could be found painting in distinctive places, always wearing a suit. From 5 to 15 July 1924, a retrospective of his work was held in the then new gymnasium of the Sichelschule. He was named an honorary citizen of the town in 1928; he presented the town with a self-portrait, and they bought two panoramas of the town with backgrounds of the Swabian Alps, in one case between Hohenzollern Castle and the Schalksburg and in the other between Lochenhörnle and the Plettenberg. All three pictures are preserved in the "Eckenfelderzimmer" (Eckenfelder Room) in the town hall, which is now used for weddings. A street was named in his honour in 1931, for his 70th birthday. To express his gratitude, Eckenfelder offered the town their choice of twelve pictures at bargain prices. Making their selection, they noted that "the earlier pictures are significantly more valuable than the ones from the present".
The Nazis respected Eckenfelder's work, whose motifs could easily be interpreted in terms of their blood and soil ideology. On 9 December 1928 Eckenfelder had signed a joint election manifesto issued by the Sparerbund (Association of Savers) and the Nazi Party, although he was not a member of either organization. In Württemberg at that time, the Nazis had a stronger conservative orientation and entered into coalitions on the local level with single-issue middle-class parties. Friedrich Eckenfelder, whose monarchist worldview had been badly shaken by the Munich Soviet Republic and who was affected by the hyperinflation of the period, could certainly identify with the contents of the manifesto. As a figurehead, he headed the joint Nazi-Sparerbund candidate list, but evidently the voters did not take his candidacy seriously: he received markedly fewer votes than candidates further down the list. In 1933, as Balingen's most prominent contemporary artist, he was commissioned by the town to produce paintings as gifts for the three newest honorary citizens: Hitler, Hindenburg and Murr. The local Nazi Party headquarters commissioned him to paint a portrait of Hitler.
When Eckenfelder returned to Balingen, he met Elsa Martz. 18 years his junior, she was an alto singer and piano teacher from a prosperous middle-class family. When she was young, she had enjoyed going to the opera; however, her family regarded this as beneath their station. Despite or because of receiving many marriage proposals, she had remained single. She and Eckenfelder developed a platonic love. They wrote each other love letters using the formal mode of address, "Sie", visited each other, went on walks together and exchanged gifts. He gave her a self-portrait and a landscape, "Steinach mit Endingen und Plettenberg", and she referred to the picture as "Bächlein meiner Liebe" (Little brook of my love). Many people in Balingen—even Eckenfelder's relatives—turned a blind eye to the relationship because they found it embarrassing. Martz did not attend Eckenfelder's funeral.
Friedrich Eckenfelder died of pneumonia on 11 May 1938, after a three-week-long hospitalization. He was buried on the south side of the Balingen cemetery church. The atelier apartment in his parental home was made into a small museum with his pictures that had been donated to the town. Initially maintained by his nieces, the building was later inherited by the city. After it was demolished, the pictures were moved to the late medieval . Today they are located in the "Friedrich Eckenfelder Galerie" in the former tithe barn, which has been converted into a museum.
Work.
The following list of works, and the descriptions, are derived from Walter Schnerring's monograph on Eckenfelder, which was written in association with a traveling exhibition of the artist's work on the occasion of the 125th anniversary of his birth.
Education and 1880s.
The following pictures show the influence of his teachers Löffitz and Diez. In the tradition of genre painting, the humans receive the same amount of attention as the animals: They rejoice in homecoming, toil at feeding time, or rest along with their horses. Eckenfelder also demonstrated an interest in human subjects at this time by producing several portraits. The motifs show the influence of other artists, such as a donkey pulling a cart (Braith) and flocks of sheep (Zügel).
Works of this period include the types that are icons of his later paintings: horses in harness at rest, riding out or riding home, and the Zollernschloss. Schnerring characterises his style as still searching, erratic and experimenting, but regards some of the paintings made during this phase as amongst his most successful.
1890s.
In this period, the methods of impressionistic are increasingly evident, particularly in the treatment of light: warm, direct light, for example direct sunlight with its red tones, and partially cold light in shadows, with blue tints, and violet transitional zones. Eckenfelder's ploughing horses become more monumental and infused with pathos, but by means of the use of light they remain a part of the landscape.
Very common in this period are small-scale, often seemingly unfinished landscapes and landscape studies in the style of the "Paysage intime", a forerunner genre of impressionism. The effect is to infuse nature with Romanticism. Eckenfelder regarded every kind of technology with suspicion. He never rode in a car or owned a camera. During this period, Eckenfelder is described by the specialist press not only as an animal painter, but also as a landscape painter and "Kleinmeister" (a reference to the "Schweizer Kleinmeister" or Swiss Small Masters, a group of landscape painters who preserved their pictures in sketchbooks). In this period he also created a relatively large number of portraits of Balingen citizens.
Turn of the century to 1918.
The larger formats and "great gestures" are not transferable to the artist's natural introverted mode of work. Schnerring wishes he had had the self-awareness of Carl Spitzweg, to know to retain the small format in his work. The core motifs in this period are ploughing horses, portraits after photographs, riding home, and townscapes. The depiction of water in paintings of watering places and fords also emerges as a theme. However, the animals now have a shiny and cleaned up appearance and hardly show any traces of the weariness of hard-working beasts as they did in his earlier works. Humans now retreat into the background, but still serve as supernumeries whom the horses permit to hold their reins.
In earlier pictures with a rear view of horses, Eckenfelder still succeeded in drawing the observer into the picture, similar to Caspar David Friedrich. In this period, the view is more confrontational. Eckenfelder was at that time a renowned artist in Munich with some important contributions to Munich Impressionism. With the end of the World War and of the monarchy, a deep rift occurred in his life. Up until then he had made his own statements; afterwards, he retreated increasingly into himself.
Later works.
In this period, he mainly painted on commission: Portraits of citizens of Balingen, views of the town, flocks of sheep and horses: horses at the blacksmith's, pulling hay wagons, pulling post wagons, pulling coaches, etc. Eckenfelder complained about the bad quality of oil paints after the First World War; in particular, the yellow for warm summer light on the hide of a grey was no longer adequate for his requirements.
In his late works, weaknesses of composition emerge. The motif is ill-positioned, waysides crop corners, streets and clods of earth are poorly executed, so that the animals with their firm lines stick out of the picture.
Eckenfelder's main themes.
Townscapes of Balingen.
There are about 30 full views of Balingen, plus in addition pictures of market scenes, individual houses—these clearly recognisable as commissions—and the ensemble on the waterfront of the Eyach with the Zollernschloss, water tower and weir. In addition, the mountains above Balingen form the background of many of the horse pictures. Many of the foreground locations in which Eckenfelder's horses are seen ploughing, were enclosed and made into housing estates after the Second World War.
The old town of Balingen—Eckenfelder's Balingen—has a mountain panorama on three sides. The Heuberg rises behind the town, only 70–80 metres high, but at a distance of less than 500 metres, an imposing presence. Fewer than 5 km away, the Swabian Alps rise 350–480 metres to the east and south. The panorama on the east side extends from the Hohenzollern (855 m) to the Schalksburg. To the south, the so-called Balinger Berge (Balingen mountains), prominently split by the valley of the Eyach, include the Lochen and Lochenhörnle (956 m), the Lochenstein (963 m), the Schafberg (1,000 m), and the Plettenberg (1,002 m). These views can only be captured in pictures by compressing the horizontal and exaggerating the vertical; artistically, the challenge is to do this while keeping the mountains recognisable. In some late works, Eckenfelder no longer succeeded in this. The panorama from the Zollern to the Plettenberg comprises 170°. Eckenfelder never dared to portray this scene. He exceeded in width only in two landscapes, both of which hang today in the wedding room of the Balingen town hall.
Ploughing horses.
Landscapes, animal studies and portraits were individually depicted by Eckenfelder. After developing a compositional technique in which the object is aligned with the diagonal, he achieved an optimal depiction of a team of horses. The distance between human/plough and horses is naturally foreshortened and the rear horse in a pair can also be fully incorporated.
In his late work, the motif of "ploughing horses with Balingen landscape background" emerges. Eckenfelder created well over a hundred variations on this theme. In his catalogue of the artist's works, Schnerring abandons purely chronological listing for this category in order to distinguish the paintings from each other. He classifies them by three criteria:
It is these "ploughing horses" for which Eckenfelder is best known. The quality of the portrayal declines beginning in 1922: "The teams of horses, initially integrated in colouring and composition, now gradually obstruct the landscape. Only in the final years do they once again become smaller; however, the painter no longer succeeds in melding them into a unity with their surroundings."

Club Seven

Club Seven is an early United States television series, which aired from 12 August 1948 to 1951 on ABC. Some episodes were 30 minutes, while others were 15 minutes.
Overview.
The series was a live television variety show set in a mock nightclub. Featured were Tony Bavaar, Bobby Byrne, and Johnny Thompson.
The concept was also used by several other early television series. "The Morey Amsterdam Show" (1948-1949 on CBS, 1949-1950 on DuMont) was also a variety series set at a night club, as was "The Ilona Massey Show" (1954-1955, DuMont). Additionally, "Hold That Camera" (1950, DuMont), "Café de Paris" (1949, DuMont), "Chez Paree Revue" (1950, DuMont) and the British series "Café Continental" (1947–1953, BBC) were variety series set in nightclubs or restaurants. 
Early Australian variety series "Cafe Continental" (1958-1961, ABC) was also been set in a restaurant, along with "The Late Show" (HSV-7, 1957-1959), and unrelated series "Club Seven" (1959-1961, HSV-7). Another Australian series, "Rendezvous at Romano's" (TCN-9, 1957) may have also featured such a setting. Early Canadian series "Nightcap" also used the cabaret concept.
Episode status.
A single 30-minute episode from 1949 is held by the UCLA Film and Television Archive, featuring Lord Buckley as the guest star.

Cor Kint

Cornelia "Cor" Kint (1920, Rotterdam – 7 October 2002, Coffs Harbour) was a Dutch backstroke swimmer who won the gold medal at the 1938 European Aquatics Championships. Between 1938 and 1940 she was three times national champion in the 100 m backstroke and set five world records and four European records in the 100 m, 200 m, 100 yd and 150 yd backstroke events. Her 150 yd and 200 m records stood for 11 year and her 100 m world record had not been broken for a period of 21 years - the longest ever in swimming (due to rule chances in 1956, the official world record lasted only 17 years, but her time was not equalled until 10 July 1960 by Ria van Velsen and not broken until 17 July 1960 by Lynn Burke). In 1971, she was introduced to the International Swimming Hall of Fame.

African spotted creeper

The African spotted creeper ("Salpornis salvadori") is a small passerine bird, which is a member of the subfamily Salpornithinae of the treecreeper family Certhiidae. It is found in sub-Saharan Africa in open deciduous forest and mango groves. It does not migrate other than local movements.
The African spotted creeper has strongly spotted and barred plumage, clearly different from the treecreepers of the subfamily Certhiinae. It weighs up to 16 grams, twice as much as treecreepers of similar length (up to 15 cm).
The African spotted creeper has a thin pointed down-curved bill, which it uses to extricate insects from bark, but it lacks the stiff tail feathers which the true treecreepers use to support themselves on vertical trees.
Its nests and eggs are quite different from those of the Certhiinae. The nest is a cup placed on a horizontal branch, usually in a crotch, and camouflaged with spiders' egg sacs, caterpillar frass, and lichen. The clutch is usually of three eggs, which are blue or greenish, marked with grey, lavender, and brown.
This species and the Indian spotted creeper were formerly considered conspecific. Together they were called spotted creeper.
Four subspecies are recognized within their distribution. The nominate "salvadori" described by Bocage in 1878 is found in eastern Uganda, western Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi and Mozambique. Subspecies "emini" described by Hartlaub in 1884 is found northwards from west Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, to Cameroon and Chad in the east. Subspecies "erlangeri" described by Neumann in 1907 is restricted to the Ethiopian highlands. Subspecies "xylodromus" described by Clancey in 1975 is found in the Zambezi Escarpment, Mashonaland Plateau and adjoining Mozambique. 
In addition to the treecreeper family, there are two other small bird families with 'treecreeper' or 'creeper' in their name – the Australian treecreepers and the Philippine creepers.

<doc id="36762378" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36762378" title="Feudal barony of Barnstaple">
Feudal barony of Barnstaple

From AD 1066, the feudal barony of Barnstaple was a large feudal barony with its caput at the town of Barnstaple in north Devon, England. In 1235/6 it comprised 56 knight's fees or individual member manors. The feudal service owed for half the barony in 1274 was the provision to the royal army of two knights or four sergeants for forty days per annum, later commuted to scutage.
Descent.
de Mowbray.
The barony was first granted by William the Conqueror (1066–1087) to Geoffrey de Mowbray (died 1093), Bishop of Coutances, who is recorded as its holder in the "Domesday Book" (1086). His heir was his nephew Robert de Mowbray (died 1125), Earl of Northumberland, son of Geoffrey's brother Robert de Mowbray. In 1095 Robert II rebelled against King William II (1087–1100) and his barony escheated to the crown.
de Totnes.
At some time before his death in 1100 King William II re-granted the barony of Barnstaple to Juhel de Totnes (died 1123/30), formerly feudal baron of Totnes, from which barony the king had expelled him after the death of his father William the Conqueror in 1087. In about 1107, Juhel, who had already founded Totnes Priory, founded Barnstaple Priory, of the Cluniac order, dedicated to St Mary Magdalene. Juhel's son and heir was Alfred de Totnes, who died "sine prole" some time before 1139, leaving two sisters as his co-heiresses each to a moiety of the barony: Aenor and a sister whose name is unknown.
de Braose & de Tracy moieties.
The inheritance of the barony of Barnstaple by two co-heiresses split its possession during the period c. 1139 to 1213 into two moieties, which became re-united under the de Tracy family. The descent of the two co-heiresses was as follows:
Henry de Tracy's heir to the entire barony was his granddaughter Maud de Brian (or Briene) (died pre-1279), daughter of Guy de Brian of Laugharne Castle, Carmarthenshire by his wife Eve de Tracy, daughter of Henry de Tracy. Maud's first husband was Nicholas FitzMartin (died 1260), who had pre-deceased his father Nicholas FitzMartin (died 1282), feudal baron of Blagdon, Somerset. Maud married secondly Geoffrey de Camville (died 1308), of Clifton Campville, Staffordshire, who had summons to attend the king at Portsmouth, with horse and arms, to embark in the expedition then proceeding to Gascony. He was subsequently summoned to parliament as Baron Camville, of Clifton, in the county of Stafford, from 23 Jun 1295 to 22 Feb 1307. Camville survived her by about 29 years during which time he retained possession of the barony under the curtesy of England.
The barony was recovered on Geoffrey's death by Maud's son William I FitzMartin (died 1324) whose son and heir William II FitzMartin died "sine prole" in 1326.
Audley.
The heirs of William II FitzMartin (d.1326) were his surviving sister Eleanor FitzMartin (died 1342), who died without progeny, albeit having married twice, and James Audley, 2nd Baron Audley (died 1386), the son of his other sister Joan FitzMartin (died 1322), by her second husband Nicholas Audley, 1st Baron Audley (died 1316) of Heleigh Castle, Staffordshire. James Audley thus in 1342 inherited his childless aunt Eleanor's moiety of the barony of Barnstaple, giving him possession of the whole. On the death of James Audley, 2nd Baron Audley ( 1312/13-1386) in 1386 the barony of Barnstaple passed to his son, Nicholas Audley, 3rd Baron Audley (c.1328-1391), who died without issue. His co-heiresses were his two full-sisters, Joan and Margaret I and his half-sister Margaret II and their descendants:
King Richard II.
James Audley, 2nd Baron Audley (d.1386) during his life had settled the feudal barony of Barnstaple by means of an entail on his heirs male, with remainder to the crown. As all his sons from both his marriages died without progeny, the barony thus became the inheritance of King Richard II (1377-1399), who granted the barony firstly to Robert de Vere, who however was attainted in 1388, when it escheated to the crown. King Richard II then granted it to his half-brother John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter (c.1352-1400), in tail-male. Audley had also been feudal baron of Dartington, inherited from the Martin family, and this too passed to the crown and was similarly granted to the Duke of Exeter.
The feudal barony of Great Torrington was also similarly granted. Holland was loyal to Richard II, and following the latter's deposition by Henry Bolingbroke in 1399, later King Henry IV (1399-1413), Holland rebelled and was executed in 1400. The barony passed to his eldest son, Richard Holland (c.1390-1400), who died later the same year.
From 1425 the barony was held by John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter (c.1395-1447), son and heir of the 1st Duke. On his death in 1447 it passed to his son Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter (1430–1475), who was attainted in 1461 whereupon his possessions were granted to his wife, Anne of York (1439-1476), the second child and eldest surviving daughter of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York and an elder sister of Kings Edward IV and Richard III. She divorced her husband and re-married to Thomas St Leger (1440-1483), who held the lands after her death in 1476 by Courtesy of England until his beheading in 1483. In 1483 King Richard III (1483-1485) granted "the Castle and Borough of Barnstaple" to Thomas Everingham, who held it until King Henry VII (1485-1509) deposed Richard III in 1485 and two years later granted it to his mother, Margaret Beaufort.
Queen Mary (1553-1558) granted the barony to Thomas Marrow, MP, though apparently shorn of all its constituent fees and manors, held thenceforth by their tenants directly from the crown as tenants-in-chief. Thus the feudal barony was now one in name only, with no substantial constituent lands or tenants, and conferred no right on its holder of taking a seat in parliament.
This so-called "castle-manor" was soon after acquired from "Samuel Marowe" by Sir John Chichester (died 1569) of Raleigh, in the parish of Pilton just over the River Yeo from Barnstaple, and several leases were granted by him to townspersons of orchards gardens and houses within the walls of the castle.
The ancient "Manor of Hogsfee/Hoggfee" etc. appears to have been connected with the castle manor. In 1732 the Mayor and Aldermen acquired 1/3 of it from John Carew and in 1734 the remaining 2/3 from Thomas Saltren and John Weddon.
Fees in 1326.
The 1326 Inquisition post mortem of William FitzMartin (died 1326) lists his fees pertaining to the Barony of Barnstaple as follows:

1895 Quchan earthquake

The 1895 Quchan earthquake occurred at about 11:30 local time (08:30 UTC) on 17 January. It had an estimated magnitude of 6.8 on the surface wave magnitude scale and a maximum perceived intensity of VIII ("Destructive") on the Mercalli intensity scale. It caused severe damage in Quchan County, particularly to the town of Quchan itself and there were an estimated 1,000–11,000 casualties. It was the last in a sequence of major damaging earthquakes that struck the area between 1851 and 1895.
Tectonic setting.
The Kopet Dag mountain range lies at the northern edge of the complex zone of deformation caused by the continuing collision of the Arabian Plate with the Eurasian Plate. To the west it links with the Caucasus Mountains through the Caspian Sea. There is currently about 3 mm per year of shortening across the Kopet Dag as a whole. The Quchan Fault zone, trending NNW-SSE, is one of a set of active right lateral strike-slip faults that accommodate part of the shortening across the Kopet Dag and extension along its length. It has an estimated displacement rate of about 1.5 mm per year. The damage areas of the sequence of earthquakes that affected the Quchan area between 1851 and 1895 follow the projected path of the Quchan fault and its likely continuation as a thrust fault in the Atrak valley, where it forms a surface anticline.
Earthquake.
The 1895 earthquake was preceded by a group of four foreshocks that were felt in Mashhad over a period of three days. The area affected by this earthquake was very similar to that affected by the 1893 shock.
Damage.
The town of Quchan, newly rebuilt after the 1893 earthquake, was again devastated by the 1895 shock. The Imamzadeh of Sultan Ibrahim, which survived the earlier earthquake with some damage, collapsed completely. 600 people were trapped in a mosque that collapsed and a similar number were killed in public baths. The houses that had been rebuilt after 1893 were again ruined, but their lighter construction meant that there were far fewer casualties. The foreshocks may also have provided warning.
Aftermath.
Initial attempts to move Quchan to a new location following the earthquake caused rioting. Only after the governor was replaced was the town moved about 10 km to the east, although some families refused to leave their farms and rebuilt their houses in the old location. The new site is, however, still within the epicentral area of the 1893 and 1895 earthquakes.

Duke Siegfried August in Bavaria

Duke Siegfried of Bavaria, full German name: "Siegfried August Maximilian Maria, Herzog in Bayern" 
(10 Juli 1876, Bamberg, Kingdom of Bavaria – 12 March 1952, Munich, Republik of Bavaria) was a Duke in Bavaria and member of the House of Wittelsbach. Siegfried August was the first of three sons of Duke Maximilian Emanuel in Bavaria and his wife Princess Amalie of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Siegfried August was the brother of "Christoph" Joseph Clemens Maria, Duke in Bavaria and "Luitpold" Emanuel Ludwig Maria, Duke in Bavaria.
Family and early life.
Duke Siegfried, son of the late Duke Maximilian Emanuel in Bavaria and of the latter’s wife, who was a sister of Prince Philip of Coburg and of Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria. Siegfried belongs to the Ducal or non-reigning branch of the ancient dynasty of Wittelsbach, and about five years ago, after having been one of the most conspicuous figures at the Court of Munich, in the Bavarian society, and on the German turf, was halted suddenly in his extravagant career by the old Prince Regent, who insisted upon the disposal of his large and costly racing stables, and upon his betaking himself abroad for t he space of a year, one of the objects of his absence from Europe being to break certain feminine entanglements which had become exceedingly troublesome.
The Duke visited America, proceeded via the Pacific to Japan, China and to India, where he shot plenty of big game, and on his way home paid a visit to Archduke Francis Ferdinand, heir apparent to the Austrian throne, at the latter’s country seat in Bohemia in order to compare sporting notes with him, the Archduke likewise having spent a considerable time shooting tigers in India.
Married and unmarried.
While staying with Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, Siegfried met his host’s unmarried half-sister, Archduchess Maria Annunciata, fell in love with her, and their engagement in due course was announced. They would have made a comely couple, for the Princess has inherited much of the brilliancy as well as good looks of her mother, the beloved Archduchess Maria Theresa, while Duke Siegfried is probably the best looking Prince of his house, a dashing cavalier, and one of the few scions of old world royalty who have achieved distinction as a steeplechase rider.
Two months later the engagement was broken off by the Archduchess, owing to her sudden discovery of the stormy antecedents of her fiancé, which she had ignored at the time when she promised to become his wife. The breaking off of the engagement was a matter which was arranged between the young people themselves, and that they had been deeply in love with each other was shown by the appeal immediately afterward by the Archduchess to the Emperor for permission to enter Holy Orders and to take the vows of a Benedictine nun, while the Duke became a prey to melancholia, which in course of time has developed into insanity, rendering his confinement now necessary.
Melancholy.
It may be remembered that the origins of the insanity of the Duke’s cousin, the crazy King Otto of Bavaria, was due to unfortunate love affair which he took too deeply to heart, and that the first blow to the reason of the late King Ludwig II of Bavaria was given by the Court intrigue which brought about the breaking off of his engagement to his cousin, Duchess Sophie Charlotte in Bavaria, on the eve of the date appointed for the wedding. King Ludwig, after being placed under restraint as a lunatic, died a violent death in the waters of Lake Starnberg in 1886, while his former fiancée, after a far from happy marriage with the French Duke of Alençon, perished in the flames of the charity bazaar conflagration at Paris some years ago.
Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria declined to allow his niece to become a nun, pointing out to her that she should be content with her office of Abbess of the Order of Noble Ladies of the Hradschin at Prague, which is a sort of semi-ecclesiastical dignity invariably held by a Princess of the Imperial house. The Lady Abbess of this particular order is the only woman to whom is accorded the right of fulfilling certain Episcopal functions, it being the prerogative of her office to crown the Queen of Bohemia when the Cardinal Archbishop of Prague, crowns the King. Among the insignia of her rank are an Episcopal miter and an Episcopal crozier, and she wears an Episcopal ring of office, which the ladies of the order are required to kiss. But there are no pledges of perpetual celibacy taken in connection with the order. Its members are at liberty to wed at any time they wish, this of course entailing their leaving the order, which was organized for the purpose of providing suitably for the ladies of the nobility who had become impoverished through no fault of their own. All that is required of them is the observance of certain rules, the wearing of a particular costume, and the performance of certain daily religious duties and ceremonies. Each of the members of the order bears the honorary title of “Canoness,’ and the Queen Mother of Spain held the office of Abbess until her marriage to King Alfonso, drawing a stipend as such of $30,000 a year.
But the present Lady Abbess, Archduchess Maria Annunciata, takes her religious duties in connection with her office more to heart than any of her predecessors, has been extremely serious, not to say melancholy, ever since she considered it to be incumbent upon her to break off her engagement to the Prince, whom she loved deeply, and now that he has become insane, and that the responsibility for the wreck of his reason is placed at her door, she is certain to become more of a prey to melancholy even than before.
Died.
Duke Siegfried August in Bavaria died in Munich on 12 March 1952.

<doc id="36762455" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36762455" title="The Sense of Beauty">
The Sense of Beauty

The Sense of Beauty is a book on aesthetics by George Santayana. The book was published in 1896 by Charles Scribner's Sons, and is based on the lectures Santayana gave on aesthetics while teaching at Harvard University. Santayana published the book out of necessity, for tenure, rather than inspiration. In an anecdote retold by art critic Arthur Danto of a meeting with Santayana in 1950, Santayana was reported to have said that "they let me know through the ladies that I had better publish a book... on art, of course. So I wrote this wretched potboiler."
The book is divided into four parts: "The Nature of Beauty", "The Materials of Beauty", "Form", and "Expression". Beauty, as defined by Santayana, is an "objectified pleasure." It does not originate from divine inspiration, as was commonly described by philosophers, but from a naturalistic psychology. Santayana objects to the role of God in aesthetics in the metaphysical sense, but accepts the use of God as metaphor. His argument that beauty is a human experience, based on the senses, is influential in the field of aesthetics. However, Santayana would reject this approach, which he called "skirt psychologism," later on in life.
According to Santayana, beauty is linked to pleasure, and is fundamental to human purpose and experience. Beauty does not originate from pleasurable experiences, by itself, or from the objects that bring about pleasure. It is when the experience and emotion of pleasure intertwines with the qualities of the object that beauty arises. Beauty is a "manifestation of perfection", and as Santayana writes, "the sense of beauty has a more important place in life than aesthetic theory has ever taken in philosophy."

Elisabeth of Hanau, Countess of Hohenlohe

Elisabeth of Hanau ( – 25 May 1475) was a daughter of Lord Ulrich V and his wife, Countess Elisabeth of Ziegenhain. She died on 25 May 1475 and was buried in the Gnadental monastery in Michelfeld.
Inhertitance of Ziegenhain.
Through her marriage to Albert I of Hohenlohe strengthened, Elisabeth strengthened the family relations between the House of Hohenlohe and the Counts of Ziegenhain, which had begun when her maternal aunt Agnes of Ziegenhain (d. 1399) had married Count Kraft IV of Hohenlohe-Weikersheim.
John II, the last Count of Ziegenhain, died in 1450 without a male heir. The county of Ziegenhain had been a fief of Hesse since 1437, so Hesse declared that it was a completed fief and occupied the county militarily. The House of Hohenlohe, however, asserted that they were the closest male heir, as their son descended from the Counts of Ziegenhain via Elisabeth. Using this argument, the Hoholohe family convinced Emperor Frederick III to enfeoff them with the County of Ziegenhain as an imperial fief, thereby raising them to the status of imperial counts. This led to a lengthy dispute, which lasted until 1495. In the end, Hesse won and Ziegenhain remained a part of the Landgraviate. Nevertheless, Albert I and his descendants retained the title of count and the status of imperial count and added the six-pointed star of Ziegenhain to their coat of arms.
Inheritance of Lichtenberg.
Elisabeth's daughter, also named Elisabeth, married Louis V of Lichtenberg. Their daughter Anna (1442-1474) married Count Philip "the Elder", the first Count of Hanau-Babenhausen. In 1480, James of Lichtenberg, the last Lord of Lichtenberg, died without a male heir. His inheritance was divided between Philip the Elder and Count Simon Wecker of Zweibrücken-Bitsch, who was married to Anna's sister, who was also named Elisabeth. This inheritance brought Hanau-Babenhausen a considerable amount of territory, most of it in the Alsace and it became almost as large as Hanau-Münzenberg. Hanau-Babenhausen then changed its name to Hanau-Lichtenberg.
Marriage and issue.
In 1413, Elisabeth married 1413 Albert I, Count of Hohenlohe. They had the following children:

<doc id="36762594" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36762594" title="England Roller Hockey">
England Roller Hockey

England Roller Hockey, which originated in England, is a game played on roller-skates with a ball and stick. It was first played at The Lava Rink in Denmark Hill, London, in 1885. The National Roller Hockey Association of England (NRHA) is the roller hockey governing body in England.
History and development.
Roller hockey, originally called "rink hockey," was established in 1896, making it the oldest sports recognised association. It consisted of 10 men on each side, and the first roller hockey games were played with a tennis ball and ordinary walking sticks, or sometimes even old umbrella handles.
During the infancy of the game, the sport built up very rapidly, with many teams starting in the London area. New associations were created for the southern and the northern parts of the country. Whilst roller hockey is still a minority sport throughout the world, it has been developed by many European countries into a well-paid, professional sport. In England, though, after its promising start, roller hockey has declined. Its number of registered players increase in line with the skating trend.
Aside from the professional coaching director, Carlos Amaral, the association is entirely amateur. The England roller hockey team has been a FIRS World Championship winner twice (in 1936 and 1939, when the championships were also contested as the European Championships) and CERH European Championship winner 12 times.
The major competition in English roller hockey is the NRHA Premier League, which has seen both Southsea RHC and Herne Bay United dominate in previous decades. Grimsby RHC is another dominant team. The secondary tournament in England is the National Cup (seniors), in which Herne Bay RHC holds the record for most wins. A recent top contender in the National Cup is Middlesbrough RHC.
The NRHA is divided into three regions: Northern Counties (NCRHA), Eastern Counties (ECRHA) and Southern Counties (SCRHA).
England Roller Hockey and the NRHA.
England Roller Hockey is the national association for roller hockey across the country. It is registered as The National Roller Hockey Association of England (NRHA).
In Britain, roller hockey forms one of seven roller sport disciplines affilitated with the British Roller Sports Federation (BRSF), which is recognised as the national governing body (NGB) of all the disciplines. The sport of roller hockey is governed by the Fédération Internationale de Roller Skating (FIRS) through its affiliate, the Comité Internationale de Rink-Hockey (CIRH), which is recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC)
The day-to-day operations of the NRHA are conducted by its executive committee members, with their sub-committees, which are elected every four years at the Annual General Meeting of the Association (AGM). The committee consists of the president, general secretary, treasurer, competitors, officials, and marketing.
In addition, the presidents (or their authorised representatives) of each affiliated region of the NRHA also sit on the association's executive committee.
Although roller hockey is an English creation, it is most popular in Latin countries such as Spain, Portugal and Argentina, where it is played professionally by clubs including as FC Barcelona, FC Porto, SL Benfica and Liceo Coruña.
The Regions.
Northern Counties.
The Northern Counties Roller Hockey Association is the regional body within the National Roller Hockey Association of England, which covers the northern counties of England, including Greater Manchester, Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. Notable clubs include Middlesbrough RHC, Manchester RHC and Grimsby RHC. While there have been many clubs in Northern England since the NRHA began in 1896, it now features only six clubs, while Plymouth and West Devon SK8 from County Devon also compete in NCRHA competitions.
Currently, Northern Counties representatives dominate men's senior roller hockey. In the 2010–11 season, while Herne Bay United won the National Cup, Middlesbrough RHC was crowned Premier League Champions. In the 2011–12 season, Grimsby RHC won their first Premier League title, while Middlesbrough RHC finished as runner-up. In the National Cup, Middlesbrough RHC defeated Grimsby 6–3 in the Cup Final on 7 July, at the Bay Arena in Herne Bay, Kent.
Eastern Counties.
The Eastern Counties Roller Hockey Association, historically the least successful, is currently the most decorated affiliation to the NRHA. It has the most clubs and members out of the three regions, and covers counties including Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire. Its most famous clubs include Bury St. Edmunds and Letchworth, which are regular senior Premier League competitors, with the former winning the league title back in 2005, and the latter winning the National Cup the same year.
Southern Counties.
The Southern Counties is the most prolific region, conceding 29 out of 37 Premier League titles and 70 of the 78 National Cup titles. Herne Bay RHC dominated English roller hockey for much of its early existence, competing at the legendary Pier Pavilion, which was demolished in the year 2011. Their success was followed mostly by Hampshire club, Southsea RHC, and later Herne Bay United, which dominated the Premier League championships up until 2010.
Other notable Southern Counties clubs include Maidstone RHC and Farnham RHC.
The Southern Counties covers the largest distance of land between clubs, spreading from Kent to Devon.
World championships.
In the early World Championships, England was successful in winning the first two tournaments:
However, following World War II, England had no success in the World Championships, apart from a second-placed finish in the 1948 games in Montreux, Switzerland.
In the modern game, the World Championships are split into two categories. The World "A" Championships contest is contested by the best teams in the world, while the World "B' Championships, contested every other year to the World A's, see the top three finishers qualify to compete in the World A's the following year in a relegation/promotion system. England usually fights to remain in the World A's, or is relegated and fights for promotion. The national team has finished not higher than 13th in the World A's in many years, although they have been regular contenders in the World A's.
In the 2011 FIRS Men's Roller Hockey World Cup in San Juan, Argentina, England finished in 15th place and competed in the 2012 FIRS Men's B-Roller Hockey World Cup in Canelones, Uruguay.
European championships.
England had great success in the early tournaments of the European championships, winning 12 titles. However, after World War II, although England attained one second-placed finish in 1948 and two fourth-placed finishes in 1957 and 1959, they have struggled to make any real international impact for many years on the European stage, which has been predominantly dominated by Spain, Portugal and Italy.

Anti-American sentiment in Iran

Anti-American sentiment in Iran is not new; the chant "Death to America" has been in use in Iran since at least the Iranian revolution in 1979, along with other phrases often represented as anti-American. A 1953 coup which involved the CIA was cited as a grievance. State-sponsored murals characterised as anti-American dot the streets of Tehran. It has been suggested that under Ayatollah Khomeini anti-Americanism was little more than a way to distinguish between domestic supporters and detractors, and even the phrase "Great Satan" which has previously been associated with anti-Americanism, appears to now signify either the United States or the United Kingdom.

Critical reception.
Digital Spy gave the EP a positive review stating, "Listening to his self-titled EP - a taster of what will follow on his debut album - it's easy to see why. Much like his contemporary, O'Shaughnessy is a fresh-faced singer-songwriter-guitar-player with a heavy heart. But while O'Shaughnessy regularly delves into the nastiness of drugs, miscarriages and booze, he remains in the tight, well-worn confines of love and relationships. Lead track 'No Name' - about an unrequited crush - remains as fresh and genuine as it did during its first outing earlier this year, while 'First Kiss' carries the same boy-next-door innocence without feeling overly contrived. 'Lost In You' and 'Sofa Bed' swerve dangerously close to borderline obsessive, but given they were written pre-BGT, something tell us he'll have a very different perspective come the full album."

Maru (Devanagari: मरु) is a historical neighborhood in central Kathmandu, Nepal and one of the most important cultural spots in the city. It is linked with the origin of the name Kathmandu, and forms part of what is generically known as Durbar Square (including Kathmandu Durbar Square, Patan Durbar Square, and Bhaktapur Durbar Square), the old royal palace complexes of temples, shrines and palace buildings all of which have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
Maru is also a market square, a venue for religious festivals and a celebrated residential quarter. It is a crossroads where two ancient trade routes connecting India and Tibet intersect.
Maru consists of a large square encircled by temples and rest houses. It presents an example of a temple square typical of traditional Newar urban planning. Streets radiate out from the square, and inconspicuous entryways lead to residential courtyards that are home to silversmiths and other craftsmen.

Trolleybus usage by country

The article Trolleybus gives a description of the electric trolley bus (trackless trolley; trolley coach) including technical details.
As of 2012 there were around 300 cities or metropolitan areas where trolleybuses were operated, and more than 500 additional trolleybus systems have existed in the past. For complete lists of trolleybus systems by location, with dates of opening and (where applicable) closure, see List of trolleybus systems and the related lists indexed there.
The following are summary notes about current and past trolleybus operation, by country, for every country in which trolleybuses have operated (aside from temporary, experimental operations). These summary notes were originally in the article Trolleybus but have been subdivided to this topic, trolleybus usage by country, in response to a comment that the original topic had become overly long.
Africa.
No trolleybus systems currently exist in any African country, but in the past, trolleybuses provided service in several South African cities, as well as two cities in Algeria, three in Morocco, one in Tunisia and one in Egypt. The last city on the continent to be served by trolleybuses was Johannesburg, whose trolleybus system closed in 1986. See List of trolleybus systems#Africa for specific information.
Asia and Oceania.
In addition to the countries listed below, the following countries in Asia or Oceania once possessed trolleybus systems, but in just a single city or metropolitan area each, and all of these had ceased operation by 1999: Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, and Vietnam.
Afghanistan.
The country's only trolleybus system was located in Kabul. It was constructed during the early months of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and opened in 1979. Damage received during the civil war caused operation to be suspended indefinitely in 1993, and the system never reopened.
Australia.
Australia has no remaining trolleybus systems, but such systems existed in Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart, Launceston, Perth and Sydney. Trolleybuses are preserved in the Brisbane Tramway Museum, Sydney Tramway Museum, Powerhouse Museum (Sydney), the Australian Electric Transport Museum at Adelaide (South Australia), the Perth Electric Tramway Society Museum and the Bus Preservation Society of Western Australia, and at the Tasmanian Transport Museum in Hobart. Some of these historic trolleybuses are in operating condition, but there are no wired roadways on which to operate them.
China.
Trolleybuses have provided regular public transport service in 27 different cities in China at one time or another. Currently, ten systems are in operation, and they include Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Wuhan, Qingdao and Jinan, among other locations. Shanghai's system is the oldest trolleybus system in the world, having been in operation since November 1914. Beijing's trolleybus system, the most extensive in China, is served by trolleybuses that can run for considerable distances on battery power. In Shanghai, new battery-only buses have been ordered to replace certain trolleybus routes. These buses charge at terminals and stops and operate from the electric power stored in supercapacitors. China also has a few very small trolleybus systems located away from urban areas, at coal mines, with trolleybuses used for transporting of workers between the mines and the workers' housing areas. One such line is at the Wuyang Coal Mine, located near Changzhi, in Shanxi province, which opened in 1985 and, as of 2010, had a fleet of 10 articulated trolleybuses.
India.
A small trolleybus system operated in Delhi from 1935 until about 1962. The Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport of Mumbai operated trolleybuses from 1962 to 1971.
Iran.
The only trolleybus system in Iran opened in 1992 in the capital, Tehran, with a fleet of 65 articulated vehicles serving a single transport corridor, mostly in reserved lanes. In 2005, the size of the system was relatively unchanged. Five routes were in operation, of which two were limited-stop services, all starting at Meydan-e-Emam-Hoseyn (Imam Hossein Square), near Imam Hossein station of Tehran Metro Line 2.
Japan.
Trolleybuses are in use on two unusual mountain lines, the Tateyama Tunnel Trolleybus line and the Kanden Tunnel Trolleybus line, both of which are mostly or entirely in tunnel and serve mainly tourists and hikers in a scenic area. These are now the country's only trolleybus lines, but seven Japanese cities had trolleybus systems in the past. Trolleybuses were part of the regular urban transport service in the cities of Kawasaki, Kyoto, Nagoya, Osaka, Tokyo and Yokohama, mainly during the 1950s and 1960s, but lasting from 1932 to 1969 in Kyoto. The last urban system to close was that of Yokohama, in 1972. In Japan, this mode of transport is regarded as a railway, so the requirements of the Act on Rail Tracks/Railway Business Act are applied. The drivers are required to get a licence of railroad engineer as well as a driver's license.
Kyrgyzstan.
Trolleybus systems operate in the capital city, Bishkek (since 1951), as well as in Osh (since 1977) and Naryn (since 1994), as of 1999. All three were still in operation in 2013. Bishkek uses trolleybuses alongside buses and marshrutkas. The Bishkek system was introduced to Kyrgyzstan by the Soviet Union during the city's industrialization period. The city still uses some trolleybuses built during the last years of the Soviet era, but has started to update the fleet with newer models.
Mongolia.
The capital city, Ulaanbaatar, has several trolleybus-operating private companies. The trolleybus system was introduced to Mongolia by the Soviet Union during the industrialization period of the city.
Nepal.
Chinese-built trolleybuses operated on a route from Kathmandu to Bhaktapur between 1975 and 2001. A limited trolleybus service was restarted in 2003, and there were plans to expand it, but they did not come to fruition. Trolleybus operation was suspended again in November 2008, and in 2009 that cessation was made permanent. "See Trolleybuses in Kathmandu."
New Zealand.
Wellington has the only public trolleybus system in Australasia. GO Wellington operates 61 Designline trolleybuses on nine suburban routes south, east and west of the city centre.
In Foxton and at Ferrymead Heritage Park in Christchurch preserved trolleybuses operate. The Ferrymead system has trolleybuses from every New Zealand city that operated trolleybuses: Auckland, New Plymouth, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.
North Korea.
Trolleybuses have operated in Pyongyang since 1962, with a large fleet serving several routes. Due to the closed nature of North Korea, the existence of trolleybus networks in other North Korean cities was generally unknown outside the country for many years, but it is now known that around 12 to 15 other cities also possess trolleybus systems, among them Chongjin and Nampho. A few other places have private, very small (in some cases only one or two vehicles) systems for transporting workers from a housing area to a nearby coal mine or other industrial site—or at least did at some time within recent years. Trolleybuses include both imported and locally made vehicles. Imported buses are from Europe and copied versions from China. There are a few local manufacturers of trolleybuses.
Tajikistan.
Two trolleybus networks have operated in this country, both having been built during the Soviet period, the Dushanbe system in 1955 and the Khujand (Khodzhent) one in 1970. Both were continuing in operation as of 2010.
Turkey.
In the Asian part of Turkey, trolleybuses have operated in Ankara and Izmir; see Turkey listing in "Eurasia" section, below, for details.
Turkmenistan.
The capital city of Ashgabat is the only city where trolleybuses have operated. The system opened in 1964 and closed at the end of 2011.
Uzbekistan.
Nine cities in this former Soviet republic have had trolleybus systems. All nine were still in operation in 1999, but by 2010 all except the Urgench system, which is an interurban line between Urgench and Khiva, had closed.
Eurasia.
This section is for countries located partly in Asia and partly in Europe. See the "Asia" and "Europe" sections for countries not included here.
Armenia.
Twenty-four trolleybus routes run in Yerevan, Armenia. The trolleybus system has been in operation since 1949.
Azerbaijan.
Trolleybus systems have existed in five cities: Baku, Ganja, Mingachevir, Nakhchivan and Sumqayit (Sumgait). Of these, the Baku system was the earliest, opened in 1941, and the largest, with 360 vehicles at its maximum and 30 routes. All five systems survived into the 2000s, but they all closed during that decade, the last to close being the Baku and Mingachevir systems, in 2006.
Georgia.
There are no longer any trolleybus systems in Georgia, but trolleybuses once operated in 12 cities (see List of trolleybus systems). All 12 systems were opened during the Soviet era, when Georgia was part of the Soviet Union. The Tbilisi system opened in 1937, while the opening dates for the others ranged from 1967 to 1986. The last system to close was that of Gori, which ceased operation in March 2010.
Soviet Union.
Trolleybuses have operated in all 15 of the now-independent republics that once made up the Soviet Union, with by far the largest number of systems being in Russia and Ukraine. For information on specific countries, see their separate entries in this article.
Turkey.
Trolleybuses have operated in both the Asian and European parts of Turkey, in three cities: Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir. Turkey's first trolleybus line began operating in 1947 in the capital, Ankara. On 1 June 1947, 10 Brill trolleybuses, joined in 1948 by 10 FBW vehicles, started running between the Ulus and Bakanliklar districts. In 1952, 13 more trolleybuses were bought from MAN. The system closed in 1986. In the financial and cultural capital, Istanbul, the first trolleybuses were introduced in the early 1960s. The first line was the Topkapi-Eminönü line and was constructed by the Italian Ansaldo San Giorgia company. The total length of trolleybus line was 45 km, and there were 100 buses in operation at the system's peak. However, due to frequent power losses it was decided to close the system, and the last trolleybus ran in 1984.
Europe.
Austria.
The largest trolleybus system in Austria is in Salzburg, with nine routes and 80 trolleybuses, operating from 0600 to midnight. The system was introduced in 1940 and has been expanded during recent years. Linz has four routes and 19 vehicles; after years of uncertainty the continued existence of the system is guaranteed by the operator. The trolleybuses in Innsbruck went out of service in 2007 because of an expected expansion of the light rail system. A trolleybus system with two routes existed in Kapfenberg until 2002. The towns of Klagenfurt and Graz closed their trolleybus systems in the 1960s.
Belarus.
The trolleybus system in Minsk (since 1952) is the second-largest in the world. Trolleybuses also work in Brest, Vitebsk, Gomel, Grodno, Mogilev and Babruysk (since 1978).
Belgium.
No trolleybus systems remain in operation in Belgium, but in the past, trolleybuses provided a portion of the local transport service in Antwerp, Brussels, Liège and Ghent. The last system, that of Ghent, which ceased operation in June 2009, had opened much later than all of the other Belgian trolleybus systems, in 1989. Government funds to build the Ghent system were provided, in part, for the purpose of improving the prospects for the export of Belgian-built trolleybuses, and the Ghent system's fleet was made up entirely of trolleybuses built by Van Hool, a Belgian company. The Brussels system comprised only a single route (the 54), in contrast to that city's large tram system. Liège had two independent trolleybus systems. One of them, a small system connecting Liège to the suburb of Seraing, operated the world's only double-ended (bi-directional) trolleybuses; the vehicles were eventually rebuilt to conventional (single-ended) configuration. One of those unique vehicles, restored to double-ended configuration, is preserved at the "Musée des Transports en commun du Pays de Liège". Trolleybuses from the other Liège system and from Brussels and Ghent are preserved at various museums, including 1932-built Liège 425 at the Sandtoft museum, in England.
Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Trolleybuses are in use only in the capital city, Sarajevo. Operation and maintenance is done by GRAS (City transportation). There are seven routes (101–107).
Bulgaria.
Trolleybus networks operate in Sofia (since 1941), Pleven (1985), Varna (1986), Stara Zagora (1988), Ruse (1988), Sliven (1988), Vratsa (1988), Dobrich (1988), Pernik (1989), Gabrovo (1990), Haskovo (1990), Burgas (1991) and Pazardzhik (1993). The most developed system in terms of density is in Pleven, with 14 trolleybus routes, totalling , and one bus route. The largest system is in Sofia: . In the late 1980s the towns of Dimitrovgrad and Gorna Oryahovitsa started to build networks, but due to financial problems the projects were suspended. A few other cities like Shumen, Blagoevgrad, Vidin and Yambol have partially completed their systems however they were never operational. Financial problems is the reason for closing Kazanlak's system in 1999. In Veliko Tarnovo due to road construction work part of the overhead wires were removed and never restored causing the system to shut down. In Plovdiv the trolleybus system was shut down in 2012 after the contract with the private company who was in charge to operate the trolleybus network was canceled due to inability to provide adequate coverage for all lines. The trolleybus system of Dobrich is due to close in April 2014
Croatia.
No trolleybuses have operated in Croatia since 1972, but two cities once were served by the mode: Rijeka and Split.
Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic has 13 trolleybus systems, in towns both large and small, and in the past trolleybuses also operated in three other cities. See List of trolleybus systems for details.
There also was a line between Ostrov nad Ohrí and Jáchymov, taking advantage of steep gradients between these towns, used only for testing trolleybuses made at the Škoda factory in Ostrov. The line was dismantled in 2006, following the cessation of production.
Denmark.
Trolleybuses were introduced in Gentofte (a suburb of Copenhagen) with one line in 1927 – operated by the regional power company, NESA. The network was gradually expanded to connect to the suburbs of Lyngby and Søborg also. From 1938 to 1963 trolleybuses were operating on the route on Lyngbyvej to Nørreport Station (in downtown Copenhagen). From 1953 onward NESA operated 4 trolleybus lines. In 1963 the two lines to Nørreport Station were converted to operate with diesel buses. NESA replaced the last trolleybus with diesel buses in 1971.
The city of Odense also got a trolleybus line in 1939. In 1959 this line was converted to operate with diesel buses.
Estonia.
Trolleybuses are in use in Tallinn. The first trolleybus route opened on 6 July 1965. At its peak, the system had nine routes, but one closed on 31 March 2000; the overhead wires remain in place. Old Skoda 14Tr and 15Tr trolleybuses are being replaced with newer low-floor Solaris/Ganz T12 and T18 articulated models.
Finland.
Tampere and Helsinki have had trolleybus systems in the past. In Tampere, trolleybus operations began in 1948 and ended in 1976. At the system's maximum extent seven trolleybus lines operated. Two trolleybuses have been preserved, in the collection of "Tampereen kaupungin liikennelaitos". In Helsinki a single trolleybus line was operated, 1949–1974. An attempt to restore trolleybus operation in Helsinki was made in the late 1970s and resulted in the acquisition of a prototype trolleybus which was used between 1979 and 1985. Three Helsinki trolleybuses have been preserved. Of these, number 605 is on display at the Helsinki Tram Museum. Helsinki is considering restoring trolleybus services.
France.
Trolleybuses are used in Limoges, Lyon, Nancy and Saint-Étienne, which have expanded their use. Preserved trolleybuses are at the "Musée des Transports" (AMTUIR) in Colombes.
Germany.
Trolleybuses operate in Eberswalde (near Berlin), Esslingen (near Stuttgart) and Solingen (near Düsseldorf). There were over 60 trolleybus systems in the late 1950s, many having replaced under-used tram services.
Greece.
22 Trolleybus lines in the Athens metropolitan area serve Athens, Piraeus and other municipalities. The trolleybus network, which is operated by ILPAP, is one of the largest in Europe, with more than 360 trolleybuses. The entire fleet was replaced with new Neoplan and Van Hool low-floor trolleybuses from 1999 to 2004.
Hungary.
Trolleybuses are used in Budapest, Szeged and Debrecen. In Budapest the fleet is operated by Budapesti Közlekedési Vállalat Zrt.
Italy.
Trolleybuses are in use in Ancona, Bologna, Cagliari, Chieti, Genoa, La Spezia, Lecce, Milan, Modena, Naples, Parma, Rimini, Rome and San Remo. The largest systems are in Milan (about 170 vehicles, serving four routes) and Naples (100 vehicles, eight routes), the latter being divided between two separate transport authorities (ANM and CTP). The system in Lecce is new, having opened in January 2012. Work is under way to reopen a system in Bari that closed in 1987, and other new systems are under construction in Avellino and Pescara, and are planned in Verona and Vicenza.
Latvia.
Trolleybuses have been used in Riga since 1947. Currently there are 309 trolleybuses operated on 19 routes by Rigas Satiksme.
Lithuania.
Trolleybuses have been used in Vilnius since 1956 (21 routes) and Kaunas (16 routes) since 1965.
Moldova.
Trolleybuses are used in Chisinau (1949), currently 340 trolleybuses serving 23 routes, Bălți (1972), Tighina (1993) and Tiraspol (1967). Trolleybuses, along with rutieras, are the most used mode of public transport in Chisinau.
Netherlands.
Trolleybuses have been in use in Arnhem since 1949. Past trolleybus systems were located in Groningen (1927–65) and Nijmegen (1952–69).
Norway.
In Bergen, Norway, trolleybuses have been in use since 1950.
In 1909, Drammen had the first trolleybus system in Scandinavia, running until 1967, and trolleybuses also served Oslo and Stavanger from the 1940s until the 1960s.
Poland.
Three cities operate trolleybuses: Lublin, Tychy and Gdynia. Several other Polish cities had trolleybus systems in the past; see List of trolleybus systems.
Portugal.
Trolleybuses are currently operated only in Coimbra, where the system is managed by a municipal authority, SMTUC. Construction of a new trolleybus system in Amadora, a suburb of Lisbon, is planned. Two other cities used trolleybuses in the past: Braga was served by trolleybuses from 1963 to 1979. In Porto, Sociedade de Transportes Colectivos do Porto operated several trolleybus routes from 1959 to 1997 and has preserved some of its historic vehicles. Unusually, the Porto fleet included double-deck trolleybuses.
Romania.
In addition to Timișoara (1942), where the first trolleybus system in Romania opened, and Bucharest (1949), where around 300 vehicles served 19 routes as of early 2009, the larger trolleybus systems opened in 1959 under Soviet influence: Brașov (shrunk considerably in the 2000s), Cluj (1959), Constanta (1959; shrunk considerably in the 2000s; closed 2010). Timișoara's system (1942) was built with Italian equipment and vehicles. Most smaller systems were opened through a government program in the 1980s and 1990s, although only about half survive: Sibiu (1983; closed 2009), Iași (1985; closed 2006), Suceava (1987; closed 2006), Brăila (1989; closed 1999), Galați (1989), Mediaș (1989), Satu Mare (1994; closed 2005), Vaslui (1994), Piatra Neamț (1995), Târgu Jiu (1995), Târgoviște (1995; closed 2005), Baia Mare (1996), Slatina (1996; closed 2005), Ploiești (1997). A "DAC 117 E" (1987) is preserved by the TRANSIRA Association.
Russia.
Trolleybus systems operate in 85 cities, including the largest network in the world, in Moscow. In Moscow, preserved vintage trolleybuses are available to the public only at transport-dedicated exhibitions and at parades on celebration days. In Saint Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod museum trolleybuses may be hired for city excursions and parties.
Serbia.
There are eight trolleybus routes in Belgrade. Three of them are variations of the original line established shortly after World War II with Russian-made vehicles, with the same terminus in the heart of old downtown next to the Kalemegdan fortress. Another is a completely independent line built perpendicular to the other three in the early 1980s. The fleet had 154 operable trolleybuses as of December 2005.
Slovakia.
The first trolleybus system connected Poprad with Starý Smokovec from 1904 to 1906. The second trolleybus system was built in 1909 in Bratislava, but served only until 1915. The route led to the hilly recreational area of Železná studienka and the trolleybuses' motors were fed by a four-wheel bogie running on top of the wires and connected to the vehicle by a cable. Trolleybuses in Bratislava were reintroduced in 1941, with standard trolley poles. In 1962 trolleybuses were introduced in Prešov. Banská Bystrica introduced trolleybuses in 1989, Košice in 1993 and Žilina in 1994. All trolleybuses were made by Škoda.
Slovenia.
The first trolleybus line in the Balkans opened to the public on 24 October 1909 in the coastal town of Piran, then part of Austria-Hungary. It ran from the Tartini Square, the central square of the town, along the coast and the shipyard to Portorož and Lucija. The town authorities bought five trolleybuses manufactured by the Austrian company Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft. In August 1912, it was replaced by the town's tram system on the same route. From 1951 until 1971, trolleybuses served Ljubljana, the capital of the then Socialist Republic of Slovenia, until 1958 alongside the tram. There were five trolleybus lines in Ljubljana.
Spain.
Trolleybuses are currently in use only in Castellón de la Plana, where a new system opened on 25 June 2008; trolleybuses had previously served the town from 1963 to 1969. The Irisbus Civis vehicles are optically guided and are capable of switching to diesel power for turning in front of the Parque Ribalto.
Earlier, at least 12 trolleybus systems existed in Spain; see list. While most were urban systems, there were also some interurban lines, including a 33-km route from A Coruña to Carballo and a 12-km route from Tarragona to Reus. Until the opening of the second Castellón system, in 2008, the last Spanish system to operate had been the one in Pontevedra, which closed in 1989. In the 1960s and 1970s, more than 100 secondhand London double-deck trolleybuses operated on various Spanish systems.
Sweden.
In Landskrona, a single trolleybus route connects the railway station with the city centre and the wharf area. The system opened in 2003 and initially employed just three trolleybuses, making it one of the world's smallest systems; by September 2013, the fleet had been expanded to five trolleybuses. Forty years earlier, trolleybus systems existed in Gothenburg and Stockholm, the latter a large system with 12 routes.
Switzerland.
Trolleybuses are in use in cities including Lausanne (10 lines), Lucerne (7 lines), Geneva (6 lines), Zürich (6 lines), Bern (5 lines), St. Gallen (4 lines), Neuchâtel (4 lines), Winterthur (4 lines), Fribourg (3 lines), La Chaux-de-Fonds (3 lines), Biel (2 lines), Schaffhausen (1 line), Vevey–Montreux (1 line).
The last trolleybus ran in Lugano in June 2001, and in Basel, where they have been replaced by gas-powered buses, on 30 June 2008. These are the only urban networks that have been closed in Switzerland.
In Lausanne, the Association RétroBus has preserved several vintage trolleybuses, the oldest example being a 1932 FBW, and operates them periodically on public excursions, especially on summer weekends.
Turkey.
Trolleybuses have operated in two cities in the Asian part of Turkey and one in the European part. See the "Eurasia" section of this article, above.
Ukraine.
Trolleybus systems run in more than 40 cities, including the interurban Crimean network connecting Simferopol with Alushta and Yalta on the coast. The Crimean trolleybus network includes the longest trolleybus route in the world, the 86-km (54 mi.) route from Yalta to Simferopol.
United Kingdom.
No trolleybus systems are in operation but a new Leeds trolleybus system is planned and the project was given preliminary government approval and funding in March 2010. In the past, more than 50 systems existed and a large number of trolleybuses have been preserved at British museums. The last trolleybuses in Britain ran in Bradford in 1972. The world's largest collection of preserved trolleybuses is at The Trolleybus Museum at Sandtoft in England. Examples are also preserved at the East Anglia Transport Museum and the Black Country Living Museum in England.
North America.
Canada.
Edmonton was the most recent city to abandon its trolleybus network, ending service in May 2009, despite opposition from local citizens. Vancouver is currently the only Canadian city operating trolleybuses, with several other cities considering new trolleybus networks, including Laval and Montréal.
TransLink operates a fleet of 262 vehicles in Vancouver, locally known as "trolleys". The city's aging trolley fleet was replaced in 2006–2009 with new low-floor models built in Canada by New Flyer, including 74 articulated units. The trolleys are valued in the Vancouver transit network for their "greener" energy usage and emissions (relying on hydro-electric power), quieter operation over diesels and the high-torque electric motors are well-suited to hilly areas of the city.
In Laval, Quebec (within the Greater Montreal area), the transit system operator, Société de transport de Laval (STL), launched a study in spring 2009 into the possible construction of a new, four-route trolleybus system. Funded jointly by STL and Hydro-Québec, the study was completed in 2010. In discussing the Laval study, some provincial officials indicated they would like to see transport agencies in other major Québec cities also consider installing trolleybus networks. At the end of the study, the Laval transit authority decided to experiment with rechargeable battery-powered buses first, before making a decision on whether to proceed with trolleybuses. Among the points noted in the study's findings were that installing a trolleybus system would require a significant initial capital investment in infrastructure, but that trolleybuses are a technology that is known to be able to operate reliably in harsh winter temperatures, whereas it is uncertain whether other types of electric buses would be able to do so, and testing of this is now planned.
A new trolleybus system is also proposed for the city of Montréal proper, by STM. Montreal was previously served by trolleybuses from 1937 until 1966.
Several other Canadian cities have operated trolleybus systems in the past. In Hamilton, where they were referred to as "trolley coaches", they were used from 1951 until the end of 1992. Toronto initially had an experimental fleet of four trolleybuses from 1922 through 1927, but later maintained a fleet of about 150 vehicles from 1947 through 1992. Another 40 trolleybuses leased from Edmonton continued operation in Toronto until the lease expired, in July 1993, and the buses were returned to Edmonton a few months later. Most of Canada's other trolleybus systems were abandoned during the 1960s and 1970s; the last two to disappear at that time (Saskatoon and Calgary) closed down in 1974 and 1975, respectively.
The Transit Museum Society, in Vancouver, has preserved at least five trolleybuses retired from service on that city's trolleybus system, and some are maintained in running condition for occasional operation on the system, in cooperation with the transit agency TransLink.
Mexico.
Servicio de Transportes Eléctricos (STE) of Mexico City is one of the largest systems in North America. In the 1960s and 1970s STE acquired trolleybuses withdrawn from service in many Canadian and U.S. cities, including Montreal, Winnipeg, Cleveland, Dallas, Indianapolis, Johnstown, Little Rock, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, New Orleans, Shreveport and San Francisco, and placed them in service in Mexico City, following these later with a similar acquisition of 37 Flyers from Edmonton in 1987. Since 1981 more than 700 trolleybuses have been purchased from Mexicana de Autobuses S.A. (MASA), fitted with electrical equipment by various suppliers (including Hitachi, Toshiba, Kiepe and Mitsubishi) for batches of vehicles ordered at different times. The size of the fleet in 2008 was around 400.
Guadalajara opened a trolleybus system in 1976 using ex-Chicago trolleybuses dating from 1951–52. The last of these were withdrawn in January 1993, and since then the service has been provided by MASA trolleybuses, most of which had been acquired new in 1982–85.
United States.
Since the opening of the first system - a relatively short-lived one opened in 1910 in Los Angeles - approximately 65 cities in the United States have been served by trolleybuses, in some instances by two or more independent systems operated by different private companies.
Trolleybus systems are currently in operation in five U.S. metropolitan areas:
South America.
Argentina.
The capital of Mendoza province, Argentina, had the first trolleybus operation in Latin America and one of the first in the world. South American Railless Traction Co., organized in London in 1912, planned to cover the continent with trolleybus lines and built an experimental route in Mendoza in 1913. (It was the only line that it built).
In 1948 the Buenos Aires City transport authority purchased 120 trolleybuses from Westram, later in 1952 the Argentine government imported 700 new trolleybuses from Germany (350 Mercedes-Benz, 175 Henschel and 175 from Maschinenfabrik Augsburg Nürnberg). Most of the vehicles ran in the capital, Buenos Aires, but about 110 were sent to provincial cities: Bahía Blanca, La Plata, Tucumán, Mar del Plata and Rosario. Later Rosario and Mendoza cities bought new ones from FIAT and Toshiba. Trolleybuses are currently in use in Mendoza, Rosario and Córdoba. Mendoza now uses 80 Flyer ex Vancouver plus a Materfer prototype, Rosario has 20 Volvo made in Brazil, and Córdoba still uses some 40 ZIU and a single BKM demonstrator.
Brazil.
Trolleybuses are currently in use only in São Paulo and Santos. In São Paulo (city), there are two separate trolleybus systems, operated or regulated by two different public agencies: SPTrans, in the central and eastern areas, and EMTU, in the southeastern suburbs and the cities of Santo André, São Bernardo do Campo, Mauá and Diadema. The trolleybus system of SPTrans (formerly CMTC), which opened in 1949, is the oldest surviving trolleybus system in Latin America and also the largest system in South America. In the past, trolleybus systems existed in eleven other Brazilian cities; see list.
Two trolleybuses are preserved and exhibited at the SPTrans (São Paulo Transportation Authority) Museum at Gaetano Ferrola. Another five trolleybuses built by CMTC (SPTrans' predecessor, until 1995) and Villares between 1958 and 1965 are awaiting restoration in the SPTrans garage at Santa Rita. A trolleybus built in the United States by ACF-Brill in 1948 was restored in 1999 and operates during special celebrations, such as the city's 454th anniversary celebration on 25 January 2008.
Chile.
Valparaíso, one of the largest cities of Chile, has the only trolleybus service currently, and it is managed by a private company, Trolebuses de Chile S.A. (formerly Empresa de Transportes Colectivos Eléctricos). The single route is numbered 802 in the regional transport scheme and is about 5 km in length. The fleet is a distinctive mix of old American, Swiss and Chinese vehicles. The most famous vehicles are the Pullman-Standards, built in 1946–52, which are the oldest trolleybuses still in service anywhere in the world. They were declared national monuments in 2003. The company has faced fierce competition from bus operators, and has come close to bankruptcy a few times, but many Valparaíso inhabitants feel an emotional link to the service, and vigorously defend the trolleybuses. During one such crisis in May 2007, even the country's president, Michelle Bachelet, expressed support for keeping the historic system running. In October 2007, the Chilean government's National Monuments Council extended the national monument status to include also the system's operations infrastructure (overhead wires, support poles and substations).
Trolleybuses operated in Santiago from 1947–1978 and 1991–1994.
Colombia.
Trolleybuses systems were operated in Medellín from 1929 to 1951 and in Bogotá (where the service was managed by the local government) from 1948 until 1991. Russian-built ZIU and Romanian-built DAC trolleybuses comprised the entire fleet in the system's last several years of operation.
Ecuador.
A distinctive and heavily used trolleybus system opened in Quito in stages in 1995–96. The single-corridor Quito trolleybus system, named "El Trole", is a high-capacity design, featuring dedicated trolleybus-only lanes over almost its entire length and with boarding taking place exclusively at high-platform stations, through all three vehicle doorways simultaneously, akin to modern-day light-rail transit systems. The initial fleet of 54 articulated trolleybuses was expanded to 113 vehicles in 1999–2000. The headway is as short as 90 seconds in peak periods, and average daily patronage exceeds 250,000 passengers. Extensions to the route were opened in 2000 and 2008, and it is now in length. Five different overlapping trolleybus services are operated along the corridor. The system inspired the design of a new trolleybus system in Mérida, Venezuela, the first stage of which opened in 2007.
Peru.
A small trolleybus system operated in Lima from 1928 to 1931, using just six vehicles on a single 3.3-km route. The six trolleybuses were rebuilt as trams in 1931, the only known instance of trolleybuses' being converted into trams.
Trinidad and Tobago.
Port of Spain was served by a five-route trolleybus system, which opened in 1941 and closed at the end of 1956.
Uruguay.
Trolleybuses served the capital, Montevideo, from 1951 until 1992. The fleet originally included 18 British-built BUT vehicles, but Italian-built Alfa Romeo or Fiat trolleybuses were later acquired in much larger numbers and comprised the entire fleet for the system's last several years.
Venezuela.
A trolleybus system opened in Mérida in June 2007. Like the 1995-opened Quito trolleybus system, the new Mérida system is a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, using dedicated trolleybus-only lanes over the entire length of the route, with signals giving priority over other traffic, and with all boarding and alighting taking place at enclosed "stations". A fleet of 45 articulated trolleybuses built in Spain by Mercedes-Benz and Hispano Carrocera provides the service.
A similar new trolleybus BRT system, Transbarca, was planned in Barquisimeto, and was intermittently under construction for several years, but the project's trolleybus component was cancelled in 2013, replaced by non-trolleybus BRT. For the planned 22 km route, 80 articulated trolleybuses were purchased from Neoplan, in Germany, and construction of the system began in 2006, but financial and political issues subsequently caused several long suspensions of work. By mid-2010, expenditures on the project had far exceeded the predicted amount and yet the first phase was only 23 percent completed. Although a free demonstration service was introduced in November 2012, serving three stops and operating for only two hours per day, using 10–15 vehicles, it ceased operating within a few months. Ultimately, the planned trolleybus system never opened, the project being cancelled in July 2013 by a new Venezuelan Minister of Transport. In addition to reasons of cost, an inadequate supply of electricity with which to power the system was cited in the announcement of the decision.
Many years earlier, a small trolleybus system (using only 11 vehicles) operated in Caracas from 1937 until about 1949, and a short-lived system existed in Valencia from 1941 to about 1947.

Al Faw peninsula landings

The Al Faw peninsula landings, also known as Operation DAWN 8, was a 1986 Iranian amphibious operation on the Al Faw peninsula. Taking place between 9 and 25 February, the assault across the Shatt al-Arab achieved significant tactical and operational surprise, allowing the Iranian forces to initially gain a quick victory over Iraqi Popular Army forces in the area. Considered a turning point in the war, unlike the tactics of human wave assaults used elsewhere at the front, the operation was a sophisticated and carefully planned amphibious operation, supported by a land-based diversion employing 100,000 troops of the Seventh Corps north of the Basra area, and using deception. 
Background.
The Iranian command was fortunate in taking advantage of torrential rain during the initial 24 hours that made it impossible for Iraq to bring to bear its superior air and artillery firepower. Not only did the amphibious landings provide a significant lodgement behind Iraq's tactical front, but they also created a psychological shock wave throughout the Gulf region. Soon after the initial landings, Iranian combat engineers were able to construct bridges to improve the flow of ground troops into the lodgement area. 
Attempts by Iraq to dislodge the Iranian troops made little impression due to lack of coordination, but cost Iraq 20-25 aircraft lost. Iran's successive operations toward Umm-al-Qasr, which had been undertaken with the intention to cut off Iraq's access to the Persian Gulf, were contained only with considerable losses to Iraq's Republican Guard despite a three-pronged counterattack on 12 February led by General Maher Abd al-Rashid, supported by some of Iraq's best commanders Hisham Sabah al-Fakhri, and Sa'adi Tuma 'Abbas al-Jabburi. However, lack of effective combined arms tactics by the Iraqi troops, and soft ground limiting tank mobility eventually halted the counterattack despite intensive close air support. 
Deception.
Iranian troops succeeded in reaching the Khor Abdullah waterway opposite Kuwait, creating reports in the local media that Iranian forces had surrounded the Umm Al-Qasr Iraqi naval base. Iraq's main air control and warning centre located north of the Al Faw peninsula that was covering the Gulf area of operations, was also captured by Iran. This created a state of near panic in neighbouring Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
Losses.
Use of chemical weapons and intense fighting cost Iraq an estimated 10,000 casualties, while Iran lost about 30,000 during the two weeks. An attempt to exploit the breakout from the captured territory to completely sever Iraq's link to the Gulf was contained.
In a panic move, several Gulf states lobbied Syria to influence Iran from further attempts to cut off Iraq's oil export facilities which would have had deleterious effect on world oil prices.

Siege of High Ercall Hall

The siege of High Ercall Hall in High Ercall, Shropshire, England took place during the English Civil War. There were a total of three sieges, In each the Hall was held by Royalists (Cavaliers) and besieged by Parliamentarians (Roundheads). The final and longest siege took place from July 1645 to March 1646, when the Cavalier commander surrendered the hall to the Roundheads.
History of the building.
High Ercall Hall, in the village of High Ercall, was a fortified 13th-century manor built by the Arkle family. In the seventeenth century the estate was owned by the Newport family and a new mansion had been built in 1608 for Richard Newport alongside the older house.
Siege.
The Newports were prominent royalists and during the English Civil War by Lord Newport (Sir Richard was raised to the peerage in 1643), garrisoned the Hall for the King with 200 troops. A large earthen bank was raised over the north and north-west curtain walls to provide a defence against cannon and musket fire.
Between 1644 and 1646 the house was besieged three times by Parliamentary forces. The first siege caused damage to the nearby church and resulted in the loss of the drawbridge, but ended with a Parliamentarian withdrawal.
The second siege ended when the now reinforced garrison again beat off the Parliamentarian attack.
The third siege however, which started in July 1645, proved to be decisive. The Parliamentary forces were now in a position to effect an artillery bombardment of the buildings and, in spite Lord Newport arriving with more reinforcements, the Royalist commander, Sir Vincent Corbet, surrendered on 28 March 1646. Under the terms of surrender the 212 surviving members of the garrison, were allowed to leave for the Royalist city of Worcester. 40 of the cavalry were allowed to keep their arms, but the rest of the garrison had to leave their arms behind along with the all the other materiel "of which there was a great plenty".
The new building erected in 1608 was severely damaged in the shelling. Only a fragment of the loggia remains as a short row of arches in the garden of the older house. With the loss of High Ercall, Ludlow was the only garrison in Shropshire left in the control of the Royalists, and it fell in May of that year.

Chronicle P

Chronicle P, known as "Chronicle 22" in Grayson’s "Assyrian and Babylonian Chronicles" and "Mesopotamian Chronicle 45": “Chronicle of the Kassite Kings” in Glassner’s Mesopotamian Chronicles is named for T. G. Pinches, the first editor of the text. It is a chronicle of the second half of the second millennium BC or the Kassite period, written by a first millennium BC Babylonian scribe.
The tablet.
The chronicle is preserved on a single fragment 180 mm wide and 120 mm long and is in fairly poor condition. It is the lower third of what was originally a large clay tablet inscribed with two columns of Akkadian cuneiform per side, and is held in the British Museum, now bearing the museum reference BM 92701. Its provenance is unknown but the internal evidence from the script characteristics betrays it to be a late Babylonian copy. It was purchased by the museum from Spartali & Co in 1882 and originally given the accession number 82-7-4, 38.
The text.
The text is episodic, divided by horizontal lines into sections of differing length concerning the events of particular reigns. The narrative style switches from classic chronicler to epic poem when describing the events of the reign of Kurigalzu II, suggesting more than one historical source was consulted in its preparation. Although the section concerning the deposing of the grandson of Aššur-uballiṭ I differs from the Assyrian "Synchronistic History" with respect to the names of the characters concerned, the identical phraseology suggests that the passages derive ultimately from a common source. Similarly, the section relating to Kurigalzu II and the battle of Sugagu varies only in the name of his Assyrian counterpart and the outcome of the battle.
The narrative begins with discussion of a treaty and some form of restoration work, but the identity of the protagonist (Burna-Buriyåš I?) is lost. It continues with a passage concerning Kadašman-Ḫarbe I that has been interpreted as a confusion of the history of this earlier king with that of Kara-ḫardaš, the short-lived successor to Burna-Buriaš II. Kurigalzu’s victory against the Elamites is likewise thought to confuse the campaign of Kurigalzu I with his later namesake. The history then hops to the events surrounding Tukulti-Ninurta’s conquest of Babylonia, providing the only extant confirmation of his seven year rule through governors. It records the revolt which placed Adad-šuma-uṣur on the throne and then describes the events surrounding Tukulti-Ninurta’s overthrow (by Aššur-nasir-apli, probably a reproduction of the error for Aššūr-nādin-apli on some copies of the Assyrian King List). The text concludes with two sections about the incursions of Elamite king Kidin-Ḫudrudiš, thought to represent Kidin-Hutran, against the Kassite monarchs Enlil-nādin-šumi and Adad-šuma-iddina, kings recorded as "preceding" Adad-šuma-uṣur on the Babylonian king list
The text is insufficiently preserved for it to be possible to ascertain its intended purpose. It contains a number of scribal errors, but, in marked contrast to the "Synchronistic History", it portrays Babylonian setbacks as matter of fact alongside their victories, which has led some modern historians to praise its impartiality, despite its apparent muddling of historical events.

Despite its fragmentary state, the text has been published by scholars in the following publications:

Harry Cooksley

Harry Edward Cooksley (born 15 November 1994) is an English association footballer who plays as a midfielder for Football League Two side AFC Wimbledon.
Career.
Early years.
Cooksley joined the Academy of Football League Championship side Reading at the age of eight and progressed through the youth system of "The Royals" up until his release at the age of sixteen, at which point he joined the Academy of Queens Park Rangers. Following his release from QPR in January 2012, he joined the Academy of Football League One side Brentford on trial, but was ultimately unsuccessful in his pursuit to earn a contract with "The Bees". However, on 10 August 2012, he was able to sign his first professional contract with Football League Two side Aldershot Town on a one–year deal. The 17–year–old midfielder made his league debut for "The Shots" on 18 August 2012 in a 2–0 victory over Plymouth Argyle as an injury time substitute for Josh Payne, in what would prove to be his first and last appearance for the club. Aldershot Town struggled throughout the season and were eventually relegated to the Conference National after finishing 24th in the league. On 1 May 2013 it was revealed that the club had failed to pay players their wages for the previous month. On 2 May 2013 "The Shots" entered administration. On 16 May 2013, the administrators of Aldershot Town, Quantuma Restructuring, were forced to make 13 players redundant. Thus with the club in a state of financial turmoil and the possibility of a new contract rendered unfeasible, Cooksley left Aldershot Town.
AFC Wimbledon.
The 18–year–old midfielder subsequently joined League Two side AFC Wimbledon on trial, making his first appearance for the Development squad in a 2–1 win over Portsmouth on 13 August 2013. On 19 September 2013 it was announced that Cooksley had signed a professional one–year contract with "The Dons" after impressing during his month on trial.

Battles of La Güera and Tichla (1975)

The Battles of La Güera and Tichla took place between 10–22 December 1975, when Mauritanian Army forces invaded the southern part of Western Sahara, which was the zone agreed to be annexed by Mauritania in the Madrid Accords. Mauritanian troops were confronted by Polisario Front guerrillas, forcing the Royal Moroccan Army to intervene on behalf of Mauritania. By the end of 1975, Mauritania controlled the southern half of the former Spanish colony of Rio de Oro.
Background.
By 6 November 1975, the Spanish government had evacuated the Spanish civilian population from La Güera during a 48-hour operation, part of the broader "Operation Swallow". Nineteen corpses from the La Güera cemetery were exhumed and embarked on the "Ciudad de Huesca" boat. A few hours later, POLISARIO flags waved on the main buildings of La Güera, after dozens of Sahrawi guerrilla fighters captured it and set up their own administration, and the town became cut off from air, sea and land.

Georgia State Route 121 (SR 121) is a state highway between Charlton County and Augusta. It is part of a three-state multistate route beginning in Florida and ending in South Carolina. 
Route description.
SR 121 begins in rural Charlton County at the Florida state line near the southernmost point in the state. Here, the roadway continues as State Road 121. From the state line, it travels to the north, concurrent with SR 23. This segment of the route is called the Okefenokee Parkway. After passing through St. George, it has a concurrency with US 1/US 23/US 301/SR 4/SR 15 in Folkston. Shortly afterwards, US 301/SR 23 split from the other routes, while US 1/US 23/SR 4/SR 15/SR 121 stay concurrent until Race Point, where US 1/US 23/SR 4 continue to the northwest while SR 15/SR 121 branch off to the northeast. In Hoboken, the routes intersect with US 82/SR 520. In Blackshear is an intersection with US 84/SR 38. North of this intersection, SR 15 splits off to the northwest, while SR 121 heads to the northeast again. The road has a brief concurrency with SR 203 shortly afterwards. In Surrency, the road intersects US 341/SR 27. Later, SR 169, and then SR 144 form brief concurrencies with the road. A short time later, the route is reunited with SR 23/SR 57 and becomes concurrent with one of these two routes once again. In Reidsville, the route intersects US 280/SR 30. In Cobbtown, SR 57 splits off. Just south of Metter is an interchange with Interstate 16 (I-16), specifically Exit 104. Within Metter itself, SR 23 splits off. North of Metter, US 80/SR 26 intersect with the road. North of that junction, SR 121 begins a concurrency with US 25/SR 67. SR 23 joins the concurrency shortly afterward.

Sloane Square Hotel

The Sloane Square Hotel is located on the north side of Sloane Square, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.
Nearby notable buildings include the Royal Court Theatre, the department store Peter Jones and the Sloane Square Underground station.
History.
The building has been a hotel for over a century, ever since the rebuilding of the northern side of Sloane Square during the 1890s. In 1900 the lease for the site was taken by George Bernard and Amos Ballard, who completed the building and opened it as the Royal Court Hotel. By 1919, the running of the hotel had been taken over by the hotelier Auguste Wild. In 2005 the hotel was bought by the hotelier John Tham, former managing director of the Cliveden hotel, and renamed the Sloane Square hotel. It was completely renovated in 2006.
Following the bombing of Sloane Square Underground station in 1940, the hotel was used as staging post for treating casualties. 
In early 1960, the hotel was temporary home to Peter Llewelyn Davies, a leading figure in London's publishing industry and the inspiration for J. M. Barrie's "Peter Pan", while en route to Gibraltar. On 5 April 1960, Davies left the bar of the hotel and threw himself under a train at the nearby underground station, making "front-page news around the world".
During the 1960s, the hotel was part of the Swinging London phenomenon, which encompassed fashion, music, art and other forms of popular culture. Early in February 1962, The Beatles stayed in the hotel for several weeks, and in the following year they used the building as a venue for a photographic session with the photographer Cyrus Andres, on 10 February 1963. The hotel also played host to the first meeting between Paul McCartney and his future girlfriend Jane Asher, when McCartney was interviewed by the Radio Times on 18 April 1963.

HMS Calpe (L71)

HMS "Calpe" (pennant number L71) was a British Royal Navy Hunt-class destroyer escort type II. Built as a result of the outbreak of World War II, "Calpe" escorted convoys during the war and participated in the Dieppe Raid. Collaborating with the USS "Wainwright" on 13 December 1943, she assisted in the sinking of German U-boat . "Calpe" was loaned and then sold to the Danish Navy, remaining active until she was scrapped in Sweden in 1966.
History.
"Calpe" was ordered in December 1939 from Swan Hunter Wallsend as part of the 1939 emergency program. She was not the first ship of this name as HMS "Calpe" had been a ship in the British Navy from 1800 to 1802. Its keel was laid the following year and it was launched and completed in 1941. Following its acceptance on 11 December 1941, the ship set sail for Scapa Flow. The ship was adopted in February 1942 by Abingdon-on-Thames in Berkshire as part of a National Savings campaign called "Warship Week".
In 1942 she sailed under the Spanish Ensign as she approached St Jean de Luz. To keep up the pretense, all the crew remained below deck. It was not until before the bombardment took place on 4/5 April that the British Ensign replaced the Spanish jack. 
On 18 and 19 August 1942 HMS "Calpe" was involved in the Dieppe Raid. Her primary function was to act as the command ship for the raid and was used by Major-General Roberts (OC, 2nd Canadian Infantry Division) and Captain John Hugues-Hallet RN (Naval Commander for the raid). She acted as a hospital ship and sustained casualties, losing nearly a quarter of the crew. Despite this, "Calpe" managed to take on and care for 278 casualties.
In October 1942, "Calpe" was included in the ships that would take part in action in North Africa. She was sent to guard a convoy to her namesake Gibraltar. (Calpe is an old name for Gibraltar). In November she became part of Operation Torch as she was included in the Central Task Force for allied landings.
HMS "Calpe" identified the submarine U593 in the Mediterranean, and together with USS "Wainwright", managed to sink the U-boat on 13 December 1943. The U-boat had already sunk two sister Hunt class destroyers, HMS Tynedale and HMS Holcombe that month. The captain of the Wainwright, Commander Strohbehn, noted in his account that "it was a pleasure" to work with the British Warship.
After the war.
HMS "Calpe" was active in the Indian Ocean until 1946. She was sent back to Britain in the November and was put in "reserve". She was laid up in Sheerness and moved to Portsmouth in 1947. During 1952 she was placed on loan with the Royal Danish Navy for nine years becoming the HDMS "Rolfe Krake". Then Denmark bought her outright. The "Rolf Krake" remained active until October 1966 when she was scrapped at Ystad in Sweden.
Legacy.
The Government of Gibraltar issued both a 5p and a 22p stamp to celebrate HMS "Calpe". The name HMS "Calpe" was reused in 1965 when the Royal Navy Reserve formed its only HQ reserve unit in Gibraltar.

Schwarz minimal surface

In differential geometry, the Schwarz minimal surfaces are periodic minimal surfaces originally described by Hermann Schwarz.
In the 1880s Schwarz and his student E. R. Neovius described periodic minimal surfaces. They were later named by Alan Schoen in his seminal report that described the gyroid and other triply periodic minimal surfaces.
The surfaces were generated using symmetry arguments: given a solution to Plateau's problem for a polygon, reflections of the surface across the boundary lines also produce valid minimal surfaces that can be continuously joined to the original solution. If a minimal surface meets a plane at right angles, then the mirror image in the plane can also be joined to the surface. Hence given a suitable initial polygon inscribed in a unit cell periodic surfaces can be constructed.
The Schwarz surfaces have topological genus 3, the minimal genus of triply periodic minimal surfaces.
They have been considered as models for periodic nanostructures in block copolymers, electrostatic equipotential surfaces in crystals., and hypothetical negatively curved graphite phases.
Schwarz P ("Primitive").
Schoen named this surface 'primitive' because it has two interwined congruent labyrinths, each with the shape of an inflated tubular version of the simple cubic lattice. While the standard P surface has cubic symmetry the unit cell can be any rectangular box, producing a family of minimal surfaces with the same topology.
It can be approximated by the implicit surface
The P surface has been considered for prototyping tissue scaffolds with a high surface-to-volume ratio and porosity.
Schwarz D ("Diamond").
Schoen named this surface 'diamond' because has two intertwined congruent labyrinths, each having the shape of an inflated tubular version of the diamond bond structure. It is sometimes called the F surface in the literature.
It can be approximated by the implicit surface
An exact expression exists in terms of elliptic integrals, based on the Weierstrass representation.
Schwarz H ("Hexagonal").
The H surface is similar to a catenoid with a triangular boundary, allowing it to tile space.

Harry Kauper

Henry Alexis (Harry) Kauper (1888–1942) was an Australian aviation and radio engineer, known for designing the Sopwith-Kauper interrupter mechanism and for his work developing radio broadcasting in Australia.
Biography.
Harry Kauper (1888–1942) was born on 12 March 1888 at Hawthorn, Melbourne, the son of Charles Henry Kauper, a carpenter and later a fruit grower, and his wife Rosa Victoria.
On leaving school Kauper became an automobile mechanic, specializing in the electrical systems. He became interested in aviation after going to see the demonstrations of powered flight made by Harry Houdini in March 1910 and in May 1911, with his mechanic friends H. G. Hawker and Harry Busteed,( known as the three Harry's), Kauper went to England to study aviation. After working for Sunbeam, in June 1912 he got a job as a mechanic with Thomas Sopwith's flying school at Brooklands. Kauper later introduced Hawker to Sopwith, who employed him as a mechanic. When the Sopwith Aviation Company was formed in 1913 Kauper became foreman of works.
In August 1913 Kauper, accompanied Harry Hawker, by then qualified as a pilot, as his mechanic in the £5000 Daily Mail Circuit of Britain race. They were the only competiors to start, but had to withdraw after Hawker damaged the purpose-built floatplane when landing near Dublin. Although they had only covered two-thirds of the course, Hawker was awarded a prize of £1,000 and was also awarded the Royal Aeronautical Society's silver medal: Kauper was awarded a bronze medal.
In January 1914 Kauper accompanied Hawker on his trip to Australia to demonstrate the Sopwith Tabloid to the Australian Defence Department. They returned to England in June and on the outbreak of the First World War Kauper became works manager for Sopwiths. Here he developed the Sopwith-Kauper interrupter gear which allowed the firing of a machine-gun through a rotating aircraft propeller. First used in April 1916, 3,950 were fitted to Sopwith aircraft during the war. On 12 May 1919 he married Beatrice Minnie Hooper, who had also worked at Sopwiths.
In 1919 he returned to Australia and in October formed the Harry J. Butler & Kauper Aviation Co. Ltd, which pioneered commercial aviation in South Australia but went into liquidation in 1921. Kauper had become interested in radio, and in 1920 he established station 5BG, one of the earliest low-powered crystal radio transmitters in Australia, at Dulwich Hill, New South Wales.
In 1925 Kauper and George Towns built the first portable radio for the Rev. John Flynn. Powered by a generator driven by the rear wheel of Flynn's truck, it worked well but Flynn wanted a radio which did not rely on a fuel supply: in 1926 Kauper introduced Flynn to Alfred Traeger who developed the pedal wireless which was to be used by the Flying Doctor Service of Australia.
In June 1926 Kauper became the chief engineer of 5CL, Adelaide (Central Broadcasters Ltd). When 5CL was taken over by the National Broadcasting Service in January 1930 he became chief engineer for 5AD (The Advertiser Broadcasting Network, Pty) and in 1931 he became the supervisory engineer to the Melbourne station 3DB, building much of their equipment.
In 1940 he was appointed to the Australian Aeronautical Inspection Directorate and put in charge of the radio, electrical and instrument section.
He died on 22 April 1942 of coronary vascular disease.

The Hobbit (public house)

The Hobbit is a themed public house located in the Bevois Valley area of Southampton, England. Thought to have been founded in 1989, it is named after a race created by J. R. R. Tolkien. In 2012 The Hobbit was involved in a legal dispute with Middle-earth Enterprises, a company owned by film producer Saul Zaentz, over its use of the name.
History and facilities.
The Hobbit is thought to have opened in its current form in 1989, replacing a hotel previously located on the site. Its name is inspired by the race of the same name featured in the works of J. R. R. Tolkien; other public houses with the same name exist in Weston-super-Mare, Monyash and Sowerby Bridge. It won the Best Pub award at the Southern Daily Echo's "Best Bar None" event in 2007. In December 2007 it was forced to close for two weeks as a result of an administrative error, during which time the pub was refurbished. 
Many drinks served at The Hobbit are named after characters from Tolkien's novels "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings". Although The Hobbit does not have a kitchen, a new Caribbean food franchise was introduced in 2009, operating from a shed in the pub's garden.
2012 naming dispute.
On 13 March 2012 it was reported that Middle-earth Enterprises, a division of the Saul Zaentz Company (SZC) which oversees copyright issues surrounding Tolkien's works on Middle earth, had accused the pub of copyright infringement over the use of the Hobbit name. The move was strongly criticised by actors Stephen Fry and Ian McKellen, both of whom appear in the upcoming Hobbit film series, and by John Denham, Member of Parliament for Southampton Itchen. A Facebook campaign to save The Hobbit was launched, and by 16 March 2012 had gained over 50,000 followers. On the same date SZC offered to resolve the dispute by allowing the pub to use the name for a license fee. Fry and McKellen later offered to contribute to the payment of the license fee. Despite the apparent resolution, legal disputes surrounding the issue continued into August 2012, when an event was held at the pub to raise money to pay for its lawyers to continue negotiations.
Ownership and management.
The pub is one of several in Southampton to be owned by Punch Taverns. It was operated by landlord Steve Dockrell prior to his death in October 2008, and was taken over by Stella Roberts in June 2009.

R. Vedantacharlu

R. Vedantacharlu was an Indian administrator who served as the Diwan (styled Diwan-in-council from 1898 onwards) of Pudukkottai state from November 1894 to February 1899.
Administration.
When A. Seshayya Sastri, Diwan of Pudukkottai retired in November 1894, Vedantacharlu who was the Assistant Diwan at the time succeeded him. On assuming charge, Vedantacharlu brought in a number of reforms. The procedure for granting agricultural loans was changed and the settlement of "inam" lands was undertaken. A Sanskrit school, a technical school and a dairy farm were opened in Pudukkottai. The state, however, soon fell into an economic crisis and the newly opened schools had to be closed shortly afterwards. Magisterial powers were withdrawn from district collectors and a new office of magistrate was created.
The state's devasthanam department was abolished in 1897 and charge of devasthanams was given to the Revenue departrment. The most noteworthy event of Vedantacharlu's tenure was the creation of the Pudukkottai state council in 1898. The council consisted of two members - the Diwan and a Councillor and was in charge of the administration of the state. The council was headed by the Diwan who was henceforth known as the "Diwan-in-council". 
Vedantachalu retired in February 1899 and was succeeded by S. Venkataramadas Nayudu.

Cuba Adventist Theological Seminary (Seminario Teologico Adventista de Cuba) is a Seventh-day Adventist theology school located in Havana, Cuba. It prepares men and women to serve the church and community in a climate of growing religious liberty.
History.
Cuba Adventist Theological Seminary has its antecedent in Antillian Union College (now Antillean Adventist University) which started in Cuba in 1922 but moved to Puerto Rico following the 1959 Cuban Revolution. In 1969 a seminary was started at the headquarters of the church in Cuba, and in 1985 it developed a relationship with the University of Montemorelos in Mexico as an extension school bringing the facility up to more universally accepted standards. In 1996 the seminary moved to a new campus built by Maranatha Volunteers International, and in 2008 it won full accreditation by the Adventist Accrediting Association (AAA). It is also one of the ten sites in the region where Inter-American Adventist Theological Seminary courses are offered.

<doc id="36763632" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36763632" title="Sørup runestone">
Sørup runestone

The Sørup runestone (Danish: "Sørup-stenen") is a runestone from Sørup close by Svendborg on southern Funen in Denmark. The stone has a relatively long and very debated runic inscription, which has been seen as an unsolved cipher or pure nonsensical, but also has been suggested to be written in Basque.
History and inscription.
The age of the Sørup stone is uncertain, but it is thought to be from the period 1050–1250. The stone is made of granite and is approximately 2,14 meters tall, 75 cm broad and 22 cm thick. In written sources it is mentioned for the first time in 1589. In 1816 it was moved to Copenhagen, where it was placed by Rundetårn and later, in 1876, brought to the National Museum. Today it is not part of any exhibition, but is kept in the archive of the museum.
The Sørup runestone is decorated with a cross and an animal figure (possibly a lion) on the front, and has a runic inscription with some 50 runes, divided between two lines on the front and one line on one of the sides. Some of the runes are not found in the usual futhark and are thereby hard to interpret. Furthermore there are two bind runes with uncertain reading order. Since parts of the stone are damaged, the reading is made even more difficult. A transliteration of the text can be:
Side A: m- : srnes-sn : urn=u=kb(h) | -a=si | s(n)rþmi : itcsih(k)i : li
Side B: isifuþrlak : iseya : li
Non-lexical interpretation.
The inscription of the Sørup stone is usually described as non-lexical, that is a text without semantic content. The runologist Ludvig Wimmer chose to make no transliteration of the signs of the Sørup stone in his book "De danske runemindesmærker". In stead he only reproduced the appearance of the carvings, which has been interpreted to mean that he thought that the ”text” itself did not have any meaning. Bæksted imagined that the carvings could be made by a ”skilful but illiterate travelling (judging by the ornament: Swedish) sculptor, who did not want to miss the commission for a monument with an inscription made by an as illiterate art-lover in Funen.” The web database Danske Runeindskrifter states that the Sørup stone “with its mixture of readable and dubious signs” gives “the impression of being a nonsensical inscription or an imitation of an inscription”.
The equal distribution between vowels and consonants has been used as an argument against the non-lexical interpretation. The longest consonant cluster of the inscription is s(n)rþm. If an illiterate person randomly would have carved 50 runes, it is likely that there would have been more and longer accumulations of either vowels or consonants.
Cipher hypothesis.
It has been suggested that the Sørup inscription is encrypted, but the deciphering attempts that have been under taken (for example replacing each sign with the next rune in the futhark) have not given any meaningful results. Another hypothesis is that the text is so heavily abbreviated that it is impossible to recreate.
Nordic and Latin interpretations.
The philologist Fr. Orluf read the inscription as a heavily abbreviated Latin text starting with a few words in Old Danish. He began on side B, where he translated isifuþrlak : iseRa with "*Isifa's Þorlak in *Sera". The segment isifu would then be the genitive case of the unattested name *"Isifa", while *"Sera" would be an old form of the toponym "Sørup". Orluf interpreted the segments li, which are found in the end of two of the lines, as an abbreviation for "libera nos" 'redeem us'. Both the Danish and Latin parts of this interpretation have been rejected by other runologists.
The linguist Rasmus Rask meant that it was possible to discern the Danish female name "Signe" at the end of side A, sih(k)i, but that the text otherwise was written in a grammatically corrupt language form. Wimmer questioned whether it was possible to read any word at all in that segment, but meant that in that case it was more likely to be the verb "signe" “bless” than a name.
Basque interpretation.
Professor emeritus Stig Eliasson has suggested that the text could be written in Basque. Unlike a dozen other European languages that he has compared it to, the Basque structure showed many similarities with the text of the Sørup stone. Eliasson's reading is presented in the table below.
With this analysis, the text would mean that someone (whose name is damaged; b(h)…isa…) let do/carve/cut (mþ•srnes.sn) these runes (urnuk) to her husband whose surname was Etxehegi (snrþmi : itcsihķi×li). On the side of the stone, an elliptical construction states that someone (isifuþrlak) did the same thing for his or her aunt or for someone with the unattested name Izeba (iseya•li). The interpretation agrees with both Basque grammar and vocabulary, and with the semantic content of many other memorial commemorative formulas of the Viking Age. A commemorative formula is a genre typical for runic inscriptions, where someone (in this case b(h)…isa… and isifuþrlak) did something (runes) to someone's honour or memory (the husband Etxehegi and an aunt or Izeba respectively). If the theory is correct it would mean that the oldest preserved relatively long text in Basque is kept in Denmark and is centuries older than the first book printed in Basque in year 1545.
Within popular science, the interpretation has generated translations such as “Basa let cut these runes to her husband Etxehegi, and Isifus to his aunt Izeba”. However, parts of these translations, for example the names *"Basa" and *"Isifus", do not find any support in Eliasson's articles. Neither does the part “aunt Izeba” has any foundation in the runic inscription, since iseya is either being interpreted as "aunt" or as a name, not as both.
Historic contacts between the Nordic countries and the Basque Country.
A Basque reading of the Sørup stone presupposes Basque presence in Funen during the Middle Ages. However, there are no historical or archeological evidence for this, but in an appendix to his second article on the Sørup stone, Eliasson mentions some examples of Medieval connections between Northern and Southern Europe. Among other things, the discovery of 24 Spanish-Umayyad dirhams from around year 1000 at the island of Heligholmen outside of Gotland is mentioned. He also brings up the Vikings' capture of García Íñiguez of Pamplona in 861. According to the American journalist Mark Kurlansky, Basque sailors reached the Faroe Islands already in 875.
Critique.
The reading has received mixed response. Apart from the difficulties that Eliasson brings up (for example the lack of a verb with the root *"nes"), there are few objections to the morphological analysis. Hellberg states that “methodically, one cannot show that a text is nonsense without trying to exhaust the possibilities of other readings”. However, many reject the Basque reading on language-external grounds. For example, Quak writes that “even though Eliasson gives a precise and extensive foundation for his thesis, one still has difficulties with the assumption of such a distant foreign language in a Danish runic inscription.” At the web database Danske Runeindskrifter the interpretation is described as “rather speculative” “because of objective reasonableness criteria and the lack of comparative material”. Also Marco Bianchi, Ph.D. in Nordic languages, questions the “reasonableness of the assumption that a Basque inscription would show up in Funen”. In stead, Bianchi maintains that the inscription of the Sørup stone most likely is non-lexical and thereby an example of the fascination that people felt for writing in a society where the majority were illiterates.

Lomond still

A Lomond still is a type of still that was sometimes used for whisky distillation, invented in 1955 by Alistair
Cunningham of Hiram Walker. It is used for batch distillation like a pot still, but has three perforated plates which can be cooled independently, controlling the reflux through the apparatus in a manner similar to coffey stills. This allows the distiller to produce different kinds of whisky in the same still. Lomond stills were installed at the Loch Lomond distillery for which it was initially designed, and the Glenburgie, Miltonduff, Inverleven and Scapa distilleries. For a time, the only remaining still was in the Scapa distillery, where it is used as a wash still, in combination with a traditional pot still. In 2010, Bruichladdich distillery installed the original still salvaged from the demolished Inverleven distillery.

German submarine U-319

German submarine "U-319" was a Type VIIC/41 U-boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" during World War II.
She carried out just one patrol, but did not sink any ships.
The boat was sunk in July 1944 by a British aircraft in the North Sea.
Service history.
The submarine was laid down on 18 November 1942 by the Flender Werke yard at Lübeck as 'werk' 319, launched on 16 October 1943, and commissioned on 4 December under the command of "Oberleutnant zur See" Johannes Clemens.
She served with the 4th U-boat Flotilla for training, from 4 December 1943 to 1 June 1944 and the same organization for operations until her sinking on 15 July 1944.
Having made the short journey from Kiel in Germany to Stavanger in Norway in June 1944, she commenced her first and only patrol on 5 July.
Fate.
"U-319" was sunk by a British B-24 Liberator of 206 Squadron RAF in the North Sea, southwest of Lindesnes, on 15 July 1944. Fifty-one men from the U-boat died. There were no survivors. The aircraft failed to return; it was presumably shot down by the U-boat's anti-aircraft defences. A crewman's body was picked up the next day. Clemens' remains were recovered and interred at the military cemetery in Stavanger.

The remnants of the lava flow are now under the Aokigahara Jukai Forest, and there is evidence to indicate that these three lakes remain connected by underground waterways.
As with the other Fuji Five Lakes, the area is a popular resort, with many lakeside hotels, windsurfing facilities, camp sites, and excursion boats. Rainbow trout and brown trout were introduced to the lake in the Meiji period, and sports fishing is also popular. However, in recent years, reduced water transparency due to pollution from these activities has been a growing issue.

Edmond (1833)

The Edmond was a chartered passenger sailing vessel that sank of the coast of Kilkee, Co. Clare on 19 November 1850. It was built in Granville, Nova Scotia in 1833, a small community near Annapolis Royal, a town that became famous for wooden shipbuilding during the 1800s. At the time of the disaster it was owned by John Arnott and George Cannock, who co-owned the Arnotts department store. Today there is a commemorative plaque engraved on the sea wall just beside the wreck site, in an area now known as Edmond Point.
Background.
Due to the Great Irish Famine, which lasted from 1845 to 1852, thousands of people emigrated from Ireland every week on ships known as "coffin ships". During these years Limerick port was the point of emigration for many people from Limerick, Clare and Tipperary. One of the ships that carried people across the Atlantic was the 3-masted barque "Edmond". Normally based in London, the ship was chartered for the year by Limerick businessman, John McDonnell. As 1850 was beginning to draw to a close, and as the weather became more and more dangerous, ships were still crossing due to the demand for passage to the New World.
Sinking.
Voyage.
After returning from Quebec, Canada with a cargo of timber, the ship set sail from Limerick on Friday, 15 November 1850. On the ship at the time were 195 passengers and a crew of 21, including the captain John Wilson and first mate William Thompson. The ship sailed down the Shannon River and on the 17th, anchored at Carrigaholt for the night. On the 18th, the ship left the river and sailed past Loop Head into the Atlantic. After a full day of sailing, a fierce winter storm struck, blowing the ship back towards the Clare coast. The captain's attempts to steer the brig back up the Shannon were futile, as the gale had destroyed the sails and two of the three masts were lost. By Tuesday 19 November all attempts at keeping the ship away from the shore ended in failure and at around 11 pm that night, she was blown into Kilkee Bay.
At first the ship ran aground on the reef at the mouth of the bay, now called the Pollack Holes, but as the tide was very high, the wind drove the ship further into the bay and eventually onto the rocks less than from Sykes House. As the ship foundered so close to the shore, Mr Richard Russell and his servant Henry Likely, the owner of Sykes House, rushed down to the rocks to help. When the captain saw the lights of these two men, and saw that the rocks were passable, he ordered the third mast to be cut down and to be used as a gangway for the passengers and crew to escape to the rocks. Mr Russell was soon joined by three members of the Clare Coast Guard, and they began to assist the passengers from the rocks and onto the land below Sykes House. All the time the tide was rising and after about 100 people had been landed on the rock, it became impossible to assist more.
At around 3 am, as the power of the waves increased and the tide rose, the ship started to break apart. This started a panic for the passengers still on the stricken ship and many were swept away trying to escape to the rocks. The ship then broke loose from the rocks and drifted towards the beach with many still clinging to the vessel. As it got too close to the shore it keeled over and many people still inside the ship drowned, the rest being thrown over the side and forced to swim to the shore. The captain and the first mate stayed with the ship until the end and escaped to safety.
Aftermath.
As everything had been done to help the passengers, and when nothing else could be done to save them, Mr Russell and people from all over Kilkee took in survivors from the disaster for the night. The next morning the extent of the disaster became apparent with bodies and wreckage strewn across the whole beach. As the day wore on it became known that of the 216 aboard, 98 lost their lives and 118 were saved. All day, bodies washed up on the beach and in the end 54 bodies were recovered. Most of the deceased were buried in the nearby Kilfiera graveyard. To help the survivors, a subscription was held with businessmen from all over Ireland and England contributing to it. In the end over £300 was raised, all going to the survivors and next of kin of the dead. As Ireland was in the middle of a famine, many poor people looted the ship, with some going as far as stripping the clothes from the dead.

The Parliament of the Province of Canada was the legislature for the United Province of Canada, made up the two regions of Canada West (formerly Upper Canada, later Ontario) and Canada East (formerly Lower Canada, later Quebec). It was established by the Act of Union 1840 and replaced the two separate legislatures of Upper and Lower Canada, following the Rebellions of 1837 and Lord Durham's 1839 Report to the British Government recommending a legislative union between the two colonies.
As in other Westminster-style legislatures, it consisted of three components:
This legislature was convened eight times in its history:
Following the Province of Canada's entry into Canadian Confederation on 1 July, 1867, the Parliament of the Province of Canada ceased to exist. Because the new country of Canada was a federation, the Parliament's powers were divided between levels of government. Its section 91 powers were assigned to the current Parliament of Canada, while its section 92 powers were assigned to the current Parliament of Ontario (for Canada West) and the Legislature of Quebec (for Canada East).

Rangarajan wrote under 10 pen names including: Mohini for historical novels, T. Duraisami for family dramas, Surya for youthful romance, Krishnakumar for mysteries, K. Malathi for postal-related stories, Mulri, Vinodh, Hamsa and Avittam for another genres.
Life and works.
Rangarajan was born in Kumbakonam to Sanskrit scholar R.V. Krishnamacharya. Rangarajan began writing at the age of 16 for "Sakthi", a literary magazine run by V. Govindan. Later, he worked for another journal "Kalachakkaram". He then became associated with the popular Tamil weekly "Kumudam" for over four decades (~1950-1990) during which time he became a household name among Tamil readers. He wrote more than 1,500 short stories and over 50 novels that included several translated works from English such as "Papillon" and some Sidney Sheldon and Jeffrey Archer novels. He was the first person to write a Tamil historical novel ("Naan, Krishna Devarayan") in first-person narrative, inspired by the English novel "I Claudius". Rangarajan said he wrote the novel "because not much has been written about Krishna Deva Raya or the Vijayanagar Empire. He was one of the greatest kings with many dimensions." The novel involved extensive research, including visits to libraries, as well as discussions with historians and artists. Rangarajan stated that he was "an admirer of Kalki Krishnamurthy" and that he "tried to emulate his style." Rangarajan said his inspirations were Charles Dickens, Alexander Dumas and Jeffrey Archer in English; Kalki Krishnamurthy in Tamil.
Some of his stories were made into films, notably including "Sumai Thaangi". 
He died 18 August 2012, at 85 years old. He had two sons and three daughters.

Shamoon

Shamoon, also known as Disttrack, is a modular computer virus discovered by Seculert in 2012 that attacks computers running the Microsoft Windows "NT" line of operating systems (it is not known to function correctly on Windows 9x/ME). The virus is being used for cyber espionage in the energy sector. Its discovery was announced on 16 August 2012 by Symantec, Kaspersky Lab, and Seculert. Similarities have been highlighted by Kaspersky Lab and Seculert between Shamoon and the Flame malware.
The virus has been noted as unique for having differing behaviour from other malware cyber espionage attacks. Shamoon is capable of spreading to other computers on the network, through exploitation of shared hard drives. Once a system is infected, the virus continues to compile a list of files from specific locations on the system, erase and then send information about these files back to the attacker. Finally, the virus will overwrite the master boot record of the system to prevent it from booting.
The virus has hit companies within the oil and energy sectors. A group named "Cutting Sword of Justice" claimed responsibility for an attack on 30,000 Saudi Aramco workstations, causing the company to spend a week restoring their services. The group later indicated that the Shamoon virus had been used in the attack. Computer systems at RasGas were also knocked offline by an unidentified computer virus, with some security experts crediting Shamoon for the damage.

Dolní Počernice (château)

Dolní Počernice is an architectural monument located at 1 Národních hrdinů street in Dolní Počernice, near the dike Počernický fishpond and a local English park. It is protected as a cultural monument of Czech Republic. Currently an orphanage is located there. Next to the castle is a small church from the 12th century, which originally was built in Romanesque style.
History.
From the 15th to the 20th century.
The castle was built from a medieval fortress, which was first mentioned in 1401. From this year comes the tabular record of the hearing succession of Jan z Cách, owner of the nearby Čelákovice. This record is the first mention of the fortress, but its origin is not known. Until the 1970s, it was presumed that the remains of the fort had not been preserved, but later findings revealed that parts of the castle corresponded to the Gothic tower fortress. On them the southern part of the east wing was built. The possibility of further research is therefore very limited.
By 1527, the fort had already been the property of several owners, having undergone substantial changes. The existing building was expanded to the north into a late Gothic style. It emphasized its character of a residential building. Apparently at that time, the defensive function was taken over by the newly built massive church tower. Later still this Renaissance fortress underwent reconstruction. In 1562, the whole property passed over to the king. The Royal Chamber of Commerce sold it at a reduced prize to Matej Hulka, burgher of Nové Město, named by Ferdinand I to the aristocracy with the attribute "z Počernice." The new owner then built the western wing. From this period dates the crest vaults arches on the ground floor, and to this day it is possible to see the evident envelope graffito on the façade.
In 1622, after the Battle of the White Mountain, the castle was confiscated and sold at a reduced price to Jan Kaprovi z Kaprštejn. From 1664 to 1769 it was owned by the Counts of Colloredo-Wallsee from Dolní Počernice. They also gave the castle its present appearance. In 1856 the Hungarian noble family Dercznyi settled here, which owned Počernice until 1923, when it was acquired by the City of Prague.
Present day.
The predominant Baroque style has been wiped off. The chateau has substantially changed and the garden has been transformed into a freely accessible English park. The chateau today includes both the so-called old mansion that originated around 1780 (the two-wing one-storey building is situated close to the church), and the new chateau built in the 19th century, with a junction of the two wings included. The garden remains with the original Baroque architecture: arbor, vases on pedestals, and stairs with a terrace.

Barcelona's Multiverse

Barcelona's Multiverse is a term based on the possibility of another Barcelona in a universe not visible from ours. With the title of the book in English "Barcelona's Multiverse", the author Lluís Bussé (Barcelona, 1961) takes the photomontages of various emblematic locations of Barcelona, with the intention of showing the existence of another Barcelona whose laws and physical constants would be similar to ours. It is based on the theories of theoretical physicist, Max Tegmark (MIT) in the Multiverse Level I.

Johnnyphlo

Johnny Jung ( born June 19, 1987), better known by his stage name Johnnyphlo (), is a Korean-American rapper, songwriter and producer. Best known for his collaborative work with various artists such as Ailee, Jay Park, Decipher, Dumbfoundead and more. Currently, he is pursuing his career in the Korean K-pop industry.
Biography.
“Everyone may have a dream but not everyone chooses to pursue it. But some, like JohnnyPhlo, never really had a choice.
Initial inspiration struck him at the age of 13 in the form of a Hip-Hop mix CD and it was love at first listen. Shortly there after, JohnnyPhlo started crafting his own material. Short battle rhymes and cipher lines progressed into hooks and verses. Written lyrics eventually became songs. He found his passion and there was no denying it. Never could he have known a little plastic disc would start the convergence of dream and reality.
Since that day, it has always been about the love of the art, first and foremost. In 2004, a new opportunity birthed itself in the form of Treble & Bassment Records, a label started in partnership with producer James “J-Star” Kim. They worked ceaselessly to develop, record, and promote a full roster of artists including the talented R&B songstress and now a K-Pop a superstar, Ailee and Hip-Hop’s leader of the new school, Decipher. Quickly recognizing the gifts and potential of his signees JohnnyPhlo pushed his own artistic aspirations aside and dedicated himself to managing, engineering and executive producing for his artists. He understood that if they didn’t have a platform to share their voices it was not they who were missing out; rather it was everyone else that never got to hear them. T&B Records quickly gained recognition in the independent Asian-American music community and although JohnnyPhlo never found himself in the spotlight during this time he was still living his dream.
However life wasn’t without its fair share of struggles. In September 2006 JohnnyPhlo found himself at a crossroads amidst mounting personal complications and tension. Recognizing the need for focus and a new personal outlook, he decidedly stepped away from T&B and music as a whole. Fortunately his hiatus proved to be short-lived as he couldn’t ignore his heart. In 2008, two years after he left the scene, JohnnyPhlo returned to much fanfare with his own song entitled “Eraser” and hasn’t looked back since.
Finally with the opportunity to answer his own calling, JohnnyPhlo has steadily moved forward with his vision. In 2009, he co-found Muzo Entertainment, an independent talent management, with his close colleagues, re-grouping the original roster of artists and longtime friends, Ailee and Decipher. Since then Muzo Entertainment and its artists played prominent role in the Asian American music community.
In 2011, with years of successful career in the Asian American underground scene behind him, Johnnyphlo signed a record deal and decided to further pursue his career in the Korean mainstream market. His future remains uncertain and it may not end up flashy and bright, but it will be beautiful. Because it is not now, nor has it ever been about himself. It’s for the love of the art.
This is more than just “real talk”. It’s real music.“

Sopwith Bee

The Sopwith Bee was a small biplane built in 1916 as a personal aircraft for Harry Hawker, Sopwith's chief test pilot.
History.
The Bee was a single-bay biplane powered by a Gnome Omega rotary engine, intended for use by Hawker as a runabout and for aerobatics. As with contemporary Sopwith fighter aircraft, great effort was made to concentrate the heaviest components as close to the aircraft's centre of gravity in order to optimise manoeverability: this necessitated a large semi-circular cutout in the trailing edge of the upper wing to accommodate the pilot. Lateral control was achieved by wing-warping.
The Bee was subsequently fitted with a single synchronised Vickers .303 machine gun, possibly with a view to meeting the Admiralty's requirement for a small scout aircraft capable of operating from torpedo-boat destroyers, but this came to nothing and no further development of the type was carried out.

Rosia Bay

Rosia Bay is the only natural harbour in Gibraltar, the British Overseas Territory at the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula. Formerly referred to as Rosia Harbour, it is located on the southwest side of Gibraltar. Rosia Bay was the site of the Royal Navy Victualling Yard complex which was constructed in the early 19th century, allowing vessels to anchor and obtain provisions, including food and water. Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson obtained supplies for his Mediterranean Fleet at Rosia Bay. It was to that same anchorage that his vessel was towed after Nelson's death in the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar. The area is also the location of gun batteries, including Parson's Lodge Battery at the south end of the bay and Napier of Magdala Battery at the north end. In the 21st century, Rosia Bay was the focus of controversy following the government's demolition of the historic Rosia Water Tanks and construction of the affordable housing development Nelson's View, which necessitated the relocation of the owners of the adjacent 19th century Rosia Cottages.
Victualling Yard complex and Rosia Cottages.
Rosia Bay is located along the southwestern coast of Gibraltar, the British Overseas Territory at the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula. It represents
Gibraltar's only natural harbour, and was formerly known as Rosia Harbour, the site of the previous Rosia Swimming Club. The bay was named after "Rosia, "a monastery town in northern Italy. 
Until 2006, Rosia Bay was the site of the 19th century Victualling Yard complex, which included the Victualling Yard, Rosia Water Tanks, and Rosia Mole. That year, the historic Rosia Water Tanks were demolished by the Government of Gibraltar, despite vocal public opposition, to enable construction of a large building, Nelson's View, which contained affordable housing units. While the Victualling Yard and the Rosia Mole remain intact, the entrance to the Victualling Yard complex is the only portion that has been listed with the Gibraltar Heritage Trust. 
The four Rosia Cottages were constructed at Rosia Bay in the 19th century as residences for victualling personnel, immediately to the west of the underground Rosia Water Tanks. In time, the cottages came to be privately owned. After the demolition of the tanks in 2006 and the subsequent construction of the Nelson's View development, the owners of the cottages were left with a large building which towered directly behind their homes. The government eventually agreed to a deal in which four properties, "Lancashire House", "St. Bernard's House", "Suffolk House", and "Surrey House", all of them formerly belonging to the Ministry of Defence, were exchanged for the Rosia Cottages. Taxpayers also paid the litigation costs and, for three of the four cottage owners, the cost of relocation.
The early history of the Victualling Yard complex is traced back to the late 18th century. At that time, the dockyard was located at the New Mole, now referred to as the South Mole, and victualling was near the Old Mole, now known as the North Mole. These facilities however, suffered great damage during the Great Siege of Gibraltar due to its proximity to the Spanish land artillery to the north. In 1799, while residing at Rosia Parade in Gibraltar, John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent, Admiral in Charge of the Mediterranean Fleet, recommended that the Royal Navy Victualling Yard be relocated to the Rosia Bay area, just south of the New Mole. In addition to access to the bay, the site had the advantage of the protection afforded by Parson's Lodge Battery. It had the further advantage of being out of range of enemy gunfire from the North Front. Construction of the Rosia Water Tanks began in 1799 and was completed in 1804 by contractor John Maria Boschetti. The entire Victualling Yard complex at Rosia Bay was completed by 1812. It formed part of the Royal Navy base and contained stores of food, water, and clothing in sufficient quantities for a large fleet. The Rosia Mole was the berthing place for the Royal Navy vessels seeking provisions and water from the Victualling Yard complex; it also held coal for the garrison.
Fortifications.
Over the years, the British built gun batteries that overlooked Rosia Bay to protect the harbour from attacking vessels. Parson's Lodge Battery, at the south end of the bay, is the largest of those defences and dates to the 18th century. The battery has a dominant position on a promontory in front of the southwestern corner of the Victualling Yard. The underlying cliffs were scarped by engineers to prevent attackers from climbing them. At one time, the battery housed three 18-ton 10" rifled muzzle-loading guns. It also provided storage for ammunition and living quarters. Parson's Lodge Battery is now under the aegis of the Gibraltar Museum.
At the north end of Rosia Bay is the Napier of Magdala Battery, construction of which was completed in 1883-1884. It was named after Field Marshal Robert Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala, and Governor of Gibraltar from 1876 to 1882. The battery is the site of the 100-ton gun, installed in the late 19th century, and one of the only two remaining in the world. (The other is located at the Rinella Battery in Malta.) The weapon was one of two 100-ton guns that Gibraltar received in the late 19th century. The British installed one at Victoria Battery, named after the queen, and the other at Napier of Magdala Battery. After the gun at Nappier of Magdala burst during firing, the gun at Victoria Battery replaced it. The former Victoria Battery is now the site of the headquarters of Gibraltar's City Fire Brigade. 
Gibraltar's 100-ton gun is listed with the Gibraltar Heritage Trust. The defensive wall and batteries at the east side of Rosia Bay, including a pair of rifled muzzle loading guns, are also listed with the trust.
Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson.
The Battle of Trafalgar, on 21 October 1805, was an engagement between the British fleet commanded by Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson and the Franco-Hispanic fleet commanded by Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve. While Britain won the battle, Admiral Nelson died during the engagement. When the British fleet returned to Gibraltar with Nelson's body preserved in a barrel, it was into Rosia Bay, Gibraltar's sole deep water anchorage, that HMS "Victory" was towed. While denied by the Royal Navy, local lore has it that his body was taken ashore at the bay, for transfer from a barrel of brandy to a barrel of alcohol (spirit of wine), in preparation for the return to the United Kingdom.

Stanley House, Copenhagen

Stanley House (Danish: Stanleys Gård) is a Rococo mansion overlooking Christianshavn Canal in the Christianshavn neighbourhood of Copenhagen, Denmark. The house takes its name after its founder, Simon Carl Stanley, and was possibly built to his own design.
History.
Early in his career, Simon Carl Stanley spent 20 years in England from where his father had emigrated to Denmark. His assignments included work on Compton Place. In 1746 he returned to Denmark where he became master sculptor at the Holmen naval base as well as a professor at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. His house at Christianshavn Canal was built in 1755–56, possibly to his own design.
After his father's death, Carl Frederik Stanley, who was also a sculptor and a professor at the Academy, lived in the building from 1770 to 1772 and again from 1779 to 1782.
In the 19th century, the building was owned by Frederik Løwener, owner of an iron foundry, who rented it out to two of Denmark's leading painters of the time. Constantin Hansen lived on the first floor from 1847 until 1856 and P. C. Skovgaard lived in the building from 1851 until 1854 when he moved a little down the street to No. 2.
When Christian's Church became a parish church within the Church of Denmark, it needed a venue for its activities in the community and Stanley House was acquired by the congregation on 25 April 1916. The building was renovated and inaugurated as a church centre by Bishop Ostenfeld on Store Bededag 1917.
Due to the economic burden of running and maintaining the building, it was ceded to Amagerbro Provsti on 1 January 1994 and now serves both Church of Our Saviour and Christian's parish, the two parishes in Christianshavn.
Architecture.
The building is designed in Rococo style. Originally, only the central portion of the building stood in full height while the two side wings were of only one storey high until they were extended in 1783. The building now consists of two storeys and a celler under a mansard roof with black-glazed tiles.
The main facade is decorated with lesenes and has a Palladian window, a rare sight in Danish architecture and a sign of influence from England. The rest of the building relies on Danish traditions and shows influence from Nicolai Eigtved. Constantin Hansen completed interior decorations on doors and panels.
On the rear side of the building, it is connected to a low complex of old industrial buildings which fills the rest of the block bounded by Store Søndervoldstræde, Dronningegade and Lille Søndervoldstræde
Current use.
Stanley House now serves as parish house ("sognegård") for the Parish of Our Saviour. It contains a residence for the rector at Church of Our Saviour, offices and rooms which can be rented by members of the congregation in connection with funerals.

Thiruvanmiyur railway station

Thiruvanmiyur is a station on the Chennai MRTS in India. Located opposite the Tidel Park on Rajiv Gandhi Salai at Taramani, it exclusively serves the Chennai MRTS.
History.
Thiruvanmiyur station was opened on 26 January 2004, as part of the second phase of the Chennai MRTS network. Since it was the terminal station at the time of its opening, a crossover was initially planned at the station to divert the trains between up and down directions. However, this was never realised as the project administration failed to include this requirement in the revised proposal for ballastless track. The up and down lines between Tirumailai and Tiruvanmiyur (a station before Velacheri) were completed during 2003. Execution of the balance portion of work beyond Tiruvanmiyur had been delayed due to the sinkage of earth. Owing to this, trains moving in the 'up' direction from Thirumailai to Thiruvanmiyur were required to be moved to the 'down' line for the return trip. In addition, safety was also in question with the operation of trains in both lines without the crossover. This led to operating trains only in the 'up' line for a long time until the construction of stations till Velachery. The 'down' line created at a cost of 1,850 million had been idling for several months.
Structure.
The elevated station is on the western banks of the Buckingham Canal. The platform length is . The station building consists of of parking area in its basement.
Service and connections.
Thiruvanmiyur station is the fourteenth station on the MRTS line to Velachery. In the return direction from Velachery, it is currently the fourth station towards Chennai Beach station, which will become the seventh station upon completion of the entire stretch up to St. Thomas Mount.
Developments.
In September 2013, the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) invited tenders for setting up a food plaza in the station, along with two other stations, namely, Thirumayilai and Velachery.

David Claerbaut

David Claerbaut (born February 27, 1946 in Tomahawk, Wisconsin) is a professor, coach, and athletic administrator, psychotherapist, and author. He earned a PhD from the Loyola University of Chicago.
Early Years.
He began his career as an inner city school teacher in Grand Rapids, Michigan, but soon moved on to North Park University in Chicago. There he held a dual appointment in sociology and psychology also serving as Chair of the Sociology/Anthropology Department. Claerbaut taught at Loyola and DePaul Universities and lectured at the University of Chicago on medical sociology. While at North Park, he published a number of popular and scholarly books. He also served as President of the Oak Therapeutic School Board (a private facility for behaviorally disordered children) and Chair of the Cabrini Legal Aid Clinic (a private law office serving the needs of Chicago’s indigent).
Mid career.
During his time at North Park, Claerbaut served as the school’s athletic director in 1986. The school won the NCAA basketball championship in 1987 under Claerbaut's athletic direction. Later in 2005, Claerbaut moved to South Haven, Michigan, where he served as Assistant Director and head boys basketball coach at a private Christian school. In his two years there, his teams won the only two basketball championships in the school’s league history. In 2008, Claerbaut moved to Las Vegas where he was brought in as head boys basketball coach at Andre Agassi College Preparatory School. It was the school’s first year in the state association (NIAA). His team won the South Regional championship and made it to the state championship game, losing by just three points. Most recently he has begun a website www.highschoolhoopsdoc.com, which offers services for girls and boys basketball coaches. He has developed a statistical system for girls and boys high school basketball that can be used to analyze a team’s strengths and weaknesses on its statistics alone. A devotee of Bill James’ baseball sabermetrics, Claerbaut first developed basketball metrics described in his book, The NBA Analyst, and then moved on to devise a statistical system usable at the high school level. 
One of Claerbaut’s sons, a football running back was recruited by over 40 major colleges. Claerbaut’s book, "Recruiting Confidential", describes his and his son’s experience. Claerbaut has also written a number of other popular adult sports books, one of which is "Bart Starr: When Leadership Mattered" While at North Park University, Claerbaut opened a private counseling service. He was also a radio psychologist on Chicago’s WIND-AM and WGN-AM. Focusing on sports psychology and performance, he worked with a number of major league baseball players during this time. His book, Liberation from Loneliness chronicles some of this experience.
Academically, Claerbaut developed a particular interest in Christian scholarship, following many of the ideas of Nicholas Wolterstorff and George Marsden. His book, Faith and Learning on the Edge, investigates the role of religion in higher education. In addition, he is the founder of faithandlearningforum.com.
Currently.
Claerbaut left his full time involvement in academe and built a business consulting firm, Dr. David Claerbaut & Associates.

Senegalia ataxacantha

Senegalia ataxacantha or "Flame Thorn" is an African tree species with conspicuous red pods and numerous hooked prickles.
Range.
It is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal in the west to Sudan in the east, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and in the Transvaal and KwaZulu-Natal. In arid regions it prefers low-lying sites near streams, watercourses and in valleys, but in higher rainfall areas is a common constituent of the bush, often favouring forest margins. Once established, young trees are quite frost-hardy. 
Description.
Its normal habit is that of a multi-stemmed, untidy, large shrub with a tendency for the shoots to scramble using their recurved prickles, and often develops into a single-stemmed tree of 5-10m in height and 300mm trunk diameter. The rounded crown of dense, dark green foliage is composed of very small pinnules. Translucent red pods provide a colourful display when backlit. The flaking bark is light grey, splitting longitudinally and transversely, and revealing a buff under-colour. The persistent prickles are profuse on young twigs, but can also be found on older wood. Unlike members of the genus "Acacia", the prickles are not in pairs, but scattered along young twigs ('ataxacantha' = orderless prickles).
Flowers occur as clusters of off-white or cream-coloured terminal spikes which are fragrant and bloom during spring and summer. The timber, resembling that of "Acacia melanoxylon", often has heart rot, but is of good quality and handsomely streaked in black, dark brown, purple and cream, with markedly contrasting off-white sapwood.
The appearance of this species may be confused with "Senegalia caffra" which differs by having paired prickles, stouter pods and greyish-green markedly pendent foliage.

<doc id="36764580" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36764580" title="School of Posillipo">
School of Posillipo

The School of Posillipo refers to a loose group of landscape painters, based in the waterfront Posillipo neighborhood of Naples, Italy. While some among them became academicians, it was not a formal school or association.
In the 18th century, landscape painting or vedute had emerged as a profitable, and respectable, style of painting. Landcapes were, in part, higher in demand than depictions of Catholic religious imagery to buyers from Protestant Europe during the Age of the Enlightenment. This included the mainly aristocratic travellers on a grand tour of Southern Europe. Items in demand by travellers were paintings evoking memories of the place, playing the role that photographic postcards now fill. Pietro Fabris, for example, had created views of Pompeii and the Volcanic fields surrounding Vesuvius and Etna. In Venice, Canaletto and the Guardi for example, had depicted mainly urban vistas of the waterlogged city. Vanvitelli, Panini, and Belloto adapted these styles to different urbanscapes in Italy and abroad. Their styles were realistic, and Canaletto was said to use a camara obscura.
Such detailed realism, however, was rarely applied to natural scenery. There was a tradition in Italy of landscape painting dating to the Baroque 17th century with Claude Lorraine in Rome and Salvatore Rosa in Rome and Naples as two distinct trends. Lorraine's landscapes were lush and imagined, and still often anchored in classical stories using subsidiary figures. Rosa painted tempestuous short range arrangements of natural elements, a craggy hillock with perilously perched trees.
At the start of the 19th century in Naples, the premier representative of landscape painters was the Dutch emigree Jacob Philipp Hackert (1737–1807), the court painter of Ferdinand IV, who seem to be following the tradition of Lorraine. His paintings had a stock arrangement of a nearby tree in a pastoral hill or mountainside, and with distant ruins or a recognizable mountain in the background. Volcano-ridden southern Campania and Sicily had such distinctive peaks. The fortunes of Hackert suffered with the rise of the Napoleonic Neoclassicism and the deposition of the Bourbon kingdom of two Sicilies by the French.
In 1815, the painter Anton Sminck Pitloo, (1790–1837) was coaxed to move to Naples. He opened a studio in the Chiaia neighborhood. he preferred to paint outdoors with natural lighting. Posillipo at one end of the crescent shape bay of Naples, was a natural spot that allowed the painters to paint both buildings and water. Some say he was influenced by the visits of Turner (1819–1820) and Corot to Naples, but in general, Pitloo's paintings are devoid of passionate political or social imagery Pitloo's favorite vedute was painted out of doors, not in the studio; and was a view of the crescentic Neapolitan shore from his vantage point from the peninsula of Posillipo. In this way his canvas scene included water, the bustling shoreline and docks, and the land across the bay. The vista while somewhat idyllic romanticism; there was also the encroachment of the daily activities of sailors, fisherman, and their families.
Like Hackert before him, Pitloo became a professor at the Accademia di Belli Arti in Naples, and was able to influence fellow painters and pupils such as Carl Götzloff, Giacinto Gigante, Teodoro Duclere, Gabriele Smargiassi, Vincenzo Franceschini, Achille Vianelli, and Consalvo Carelli. Many of the works of these painter from circa 1820 to circa 1850 are known as products of the "School of Posillipo". Other painters influence by this school are Salvatore Fergola, a pupil of Hackert. In time, the lessening of the demands for accuracy and a greater attention to the mood of the painting during the age of Romanticism, led to more impressionist styles found in post-1850s Tuscan school of Macchiaioli (who also painted out of doors), or in the School of Resina represented by painters such as Guglielmo Ciardi.
The most prominent of Pitloo's students was Giacinto Gigante (1806–1876), who started his career working for the Neapolitan Royal Topographic Office. Gigante had observed the use of a camara lucida in the studio of Swiss-German artist, Jakob Wilhelm Hüber (1787–1871), who used camara lucida. He also worked with watercolors. He collaborated with Cuciniello and Bianchi in landscapes collected in a book titled "Viaggio pittorico nel Regno delle Due Sicilie" (Pictorial journey through the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies). Gigante befriended Sylvester Shchedrin, and through him also obtained commissions from the Russian aristocracy. Like Pitloo before him, Gigante he was appointed chief of design at the Neapolitan Academy. Giuseppe and Filippo Palizzi (1818–1899) were briefly pupils of Gigante, but soon fell under the influence of the Barbizon School, who in turn were to influence Domenico Morelli

Positive systems

Positive systems constitute a class of systems that has the important property that its state variables are never negative, given a positive initial state. These systems appear frequently in practical applications, as these variables represent physical quantities, with positive sign (levels, heights, concentrations, etc.).
The fact that a system is positive has important implications in the control system design, as the system. It is also important to take this positivity into account for state observer design, as standard observers (for example Luenberger observers) might give illogical negative values.

Her victory not only ended Williams' 25-match winning streak, which had dated back to Cincinnati last year, but also earned worldwide recognition and was one of the most discussed matches on social media, beating the record previously set during the 2012 Australian Open men's final. It was later revealed that Williams had played through the match with a back injury, which affected her performance in this match.
Elsewhere, 6-time Australian Open champions, the Bryan Brothers made their earliest exit at the Australian Open in 11 years after they were defeated by the unseeded duo of Eric Butorac and Raven Klaasen.

Day 10 (January 22).
Roger Federer became the first man to reach 11 consecutive semifinals at the Australian Open following his four-set victory over Andy Murray in the quarterfinals.

In winning the first set, Wawrinka was down 0–40 while serving for it at 5–3, but Nadal was unable to return any of Wawrinka's next five serves, which proved to be Wawrinka's 34th consecutive successful hold of serve. In the second set, Wawrinka broke in the opening game and held his own serve to lead 2–0, before Nadal sustained a back injury and needed a medical timeout. Wawrinka comfortably won the set as commentators speculated that Nadal may have been considering forfeiting the match and was seen to be in tears during changeovers. Nadal continued and managed to win the third set, despite facing 15–40 in the first game on his own serve and also facing 15–40 while serving for the set at 5–3, as Wawrinka appeared to be suffering from nerves. Wawrinka won the match in the fourth set by winning the last eight points without reply. Pete Sampras awarded Wawrinka the trophy. This was the first time since Sergi Bruguera's 1993 French Open win that the winner of a Grand Slam men's event beat both number one and two seeds to clinch the championship; Wawrinka also became the first player to beat both Djokovic and Nadal in the same grand slam.
For Wawrinka, it was his first career Grand Slam title. In twelve previous match versus Nadal, he had not won a single set.

MV Farah III

MV "Farah III" was a general cargo ship built in 1981. She was registered in Jordan and owned by Salam International Transport & Trading Co.
Fate.
In December 2006, "Farah III" was en route from India to South Africa with a cargo of rice when she suffered engine trouble off the east coast of Sri Lanka. The crew sent out a distress signal and dropped anchor near the town of Mullaitivu, an area held by the militant rebel faction Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). On December 23, the ship was boarded by members of LTTE's naval wing, the Sea Tigers. According to the crew, the rebels ordered them to raise the anchor, after trying and failing to blow up the anchor cable, then forced them into smaller boats. The Tigers later denied this account, insisting that were only helping the crew, who were delivered safely to the Red Cross. However, the drifting ship subsequently ran aground, and its owner, Salam International, reported some months later that the "Farah III" had been stripped bare by the LTTE; not only had 14,000 metric tons of rice been taken, but also equipment such as lights and generators. Salam International also reported that they had been unable to secure safe passage for the insurance company and surveyors to visit the ship.
Capture by the Sri Lanka Army.
On May 14, 2009, just days before government forces declared victory over the rebels and an end to the Sri Lankan Civil War, troops of the 58 Division captured the grounded ship, which was being used by the Sea Tigers as their operational centre.

The event features the Pride Parade on a Saturday, preceded by a block party in the Hillcrest neighborhood the night before, and followed by a two-day Pride Festival on Saturday and Sunday in Balboa Park. It is sponsored by San Diego LGBT Pride and is believed to be the largest civic event in the city of San Diego. The parade has more than 200 floats and entries and is viewed by a crowd of nearly 200,000 people.
Mission.
The mission of San Diego LGBT Pride is "fostering pride in and respect for all lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender communities locally, nationally, and globally."
Vision.
The vision of San Diego LGBT Pride is "a world free of prejudice and bias."
Origins.
In the 1970s, gay men in San Diego founded a Center for Social Services in a house at 2250 B Street. The Center became a social and political focus for the gay community. In June 1974 the Center hosted a gay pride event which included a yard sale and potluck dinner at the Center as well as an informal parade to Balboa Park and back. Marchers had to walk on the sidewalk since they had no city parade permit. In 1975 the community was able to secure permits for a rally and a 400-person march. The parade has been held every year since, despite organizational and financial problems, which were finally solved in 1989 with the formation of a permanent Pride organization with professional management.
In 1991 the event was moved from June to July. In 1993 the parade was moved to its current route from Hillcrest along University Avenue and 6th Avenue to Balboa Park.
Recent history.
In 1994 former mayor and current talk-show host Roger Hedgecock organized a group of protesters calling themselves "The Normal People". They applied to march in the Pride parade “in political disagreement to the homosexual agenda.” When rejected by the organizers of the parade, Hedgecock filed a lawsuit, arguing that their exclusion violated San Diego's "Human Dignity Ordinance." The Superior Court rejected their claim, arguing that their right to march was not protected under the ordinance, since the parade was a private event and the "Normal People" message was intended to interfere with the event.
In 2011 several hundred active and retired military service members marched in the parade, in anticipation of the imminent removal of the "Don't ask, don't tell" rule for U.S. military personnel. They did not wear military uniforms, but rather T-shirts with the name of their branch of service. This was the first time that active-duty American military personnel publicly marched in a gay pride parade.
In 2012 the U.S. Department of Defense granted permission for military personnel to wear their uniforms while participating the San Diego Pride Parade. This was the first time that United States military personnel were permitted to wear their service uniforms in such a parade. The local Navy command had already approved the wearing of Navy uniforms, but the DOD decided to add their official stamp of approval "since the event has garnered national media attention." The Defense Department stressed that this was a one-time approval and applied only to this particular parade, based on their determination that the event was a non-political civic event. Military members are generally permitted to participate in parades if the parade is nonpolitical, patriotic in nature, and a civic event, but they need specific permission to wear their uniforms at such an event. The DOD directive stated, "Based on our current knowledge of the event and existing policies, we hereby are granting approval for servicemembers in uniform to participate in this year's parade, provided servicemembers participate in their personal capacity and ensure the adherence to military service standards of appearance and wear of the military uniform." Two Republican congressmen objected to the decision, saying that the parade was political in nature, but organizers said it was not political, pointing out that both of San Diego's mayoral candidates marched in the parade, even though one is a conservative Republican and the other is a liberal Democrat.
Also in 2012, the parade started from Harvey Milk Street, the first street in the nation to be named after gay civil rights icon Harvey Milk, and proceeded past a huge new rainbow flag, which was raised for the first time on July 20, 2012 to kick off the Pride festival. Both the street rename and the flag were unanimously approved by the City Council in May.
The 2013 festival featured an outdoor wedding chapel (couples arranged for their own officiants) in celebration of the overturning of California Proposition 8 the previous month. Grand marshals were Latoya Jackson and George Takei with his husband Brad.

Rococo Revival

Rococo Revival was a nineteenth-century furniture style, based on Rococo, and characterized by curved silhouettes and ornate carving. Its best-known maker in the United States was John Henry Belter.
It began as a "Modern French" style in England in the 1820s, drawing on baroque elements of Louis XVI and Louis XV furniture, and developed in France in the 1830s under Louis Philippe. The style was popularized at the 1851 Crystal Palace Exposition in London, and at expositions in New York in 1853, and Paris in 1855.
Belter (1804-1863) was a German-born cabinetmaker who patented a process for making laminated furniture. Thin layers of different woods were glued together, bent under steam pressure, and pressed into molds, then carved. This was stronger and far cheaper than traditional carving, and could be mass-produced.

Aufhocker

The aufhocker is a shapeshifter in German folklore.
Characteristics.
The aufhocker is never identified in literature as having an identifiable shape. It's known for taking on the form of animals and in some cases, human beings in order to fulfill whatever duty it sees fit. In most cases, the aufhocker is considered to be a very dangerous theriomorph that tears the throats out of humans. The connection to attacking victims in the throat is what links the aufhocker to vampirism.
The aufhocker can not be killed. In vampire mythology, sunlight and church bells are often used to frighten vampires. These defenses are also linked to the aufhocker.
Legend.
The name aufhocker means "leap upon." This is because according to legend, the aufhocker would leap upon the back of the victim before biting their throats.

Hickory Ground

Hickory Ground, also known as Otciapofa (or Odshiapofa, Ocheopofau, and Ocheubofau) is an historic Upper Muscogee Creek tribal town and an archaeological site in Elmore County, Alabama near Wetumpka. It is known as Oce Vpofa in the Muscogee language; the name derives from oche-ub,"hickory" and po-fau, "among". It is best known for serving as the last capital of the National Council of the Creek Nation, prior to the tribe being moved to the Indian Territory in the 1830s. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 10, 1980.
Archaeological site.
The 33-acre archaeological site, numbered 1Ee89, is outside Wetumpka on the lower Coosa River, north of where it joins the Tallapoosa River. It is a former village with a ceremonial ground, burial grounds, and refuse sites.
History.
Hickory Ground, or Otciapofa, was established by Muscogee Creeks from Little Tulsa, located on the Coosa River. The site was documented during historic times by William Bartram in the 1760s and Benjamin Hawkins in 1799. The town was home to several thousand Muscogee and served as the last capital of the National Council of the Creek Nation from 1802 until 1814. During the Creek War, the inhabitants who were not fighting in the war were confined at nearby Fort Jackson. After the end of the war, they were allowed to resettle the site and remained there until 1832, when they were forcibly removed to the Indian Territory.
The site was rediscovered in 1968 by archaeologist David Chase of Auburn University. The rediscovery was not made public until much later, when plans to build apartments on the site were announced. Through the efforts of the Alabama Historical Commission and the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, the site was acquired in early 1980 through matching funds of $165,000 from the United States Department of the Interior and tax break incentives for the previous owner. Excavations in 1988 and 1991 found evidence of occupation at the site during five distinct cultural periods, ranging from the Early Archaic (8000–6000 B.C.) to the historic Muscogee occupation.
The members of Otciapofa tribal town formed part of the Muscogee Creek Confederacy in Alabama, prior to their forced removal to Indian Territory during the 1830s. After resettling in Indian Territory, the members of Hickory Ground established another town of that name near Henryetta, Oklahoma. Chitto Harjo belonged to new Hickory Ground, where the Crazy Snake Uprising of 1901 was launched.
Controversy.
In August 1980, the property was granted to the Poarch Band. It was placed under a 20 year easement that limited development of the property. The site became part of the Poarch Band’s reservation lands in 1984, when they became a federally recognized tribe. Following the expiration of the easement, the Poarch built a Native American bingo hall at the site from 2001–02, which required the excavation of the bingo hall site and exhumation of Muscogee graves found there. The Muscogee (Creek) Nation of Oklahoma called construction at the site "deplorable" and claimed that many burials were disturbed during the initial building phase. This commercial development of the site for a bingo hall was also opposed by other tribes, from both inside and outside the state; the Alabama Historical Commission; Alabama's delegation in the House of Representatives, which introduced legislation in a failed attempt to stop it; and roughly 50 Poarch members, who wrote letters to the Alabama Historical Commission.
The July 2012 announcement of a $246 million expansion to create a 20-story hotel and casino at the site, caused further outcry from the Muscogee Creek Nation and the threat of legal action. The Poarch denied that the historic site itself was affected by their development, stating in a news release that it was "protected land that is not part of a casino expansion." The dispute over the development of Hickory Ground is part of a wider disagreement between the Poarch Band and the Oklahoma Muscogee; some in the Oklahoma tribe view themselves as 'traditionalists' and see the Poarch Band, who stayed behind in Alabama when the rest of the Muscogee were removed during the Trail of Tears, as being "questionable Indians".
The Montgomery Advertiser's article of August 21, 2012, stated: Robert McGhee, a member of the Poarch Band tribal council gave no indication that the group planned to halt construction and disagreed with Tiger’s charge that the group lacked respect for cultural values. “We have taken great care to honor history and preserve the past while ensuring the future for our tribe,” he responded by email to the Advertiser. “It is unfortunate that neither the issue nor our response to it was portrayed accurately, but we understand that these centuries-old wounds are deep and the hurt that resulted from tribes being forcibly removed from the Southeast still remains.”
On October 12, 2012, the Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes, including the Chickasaw, Choctaw, Cherokee, Muscogee (Creek) and Seminole Nations, unanimously adopted a Resolution supporting efforts to halt the desecration of Hickory Ground.
On December 12, 2012, the Muscogee Creek Nation and the Hickory Ground Tribal Town filed a federal lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama to stop the casino development. The lawsuit alleges that the excavation of Muscogee Creek human remains and funerary objects from Hickory Ground violated the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) and other federal laws.
The multi-story hotel is currently in construction as of 2013 on the site.

Boxing at the 1948 Summer Olympics – Men's lightweight

The men's lightweight boxing competition at the 1948 Olympic Games in London was held from 9 to 13 August at the Empress Hall in Earl's Court and the Wembley Arena.
Competition format.
Like all Olympic boxing events, the competition was a straight single-elimination tournament. The competition began with a preliminary round on 9 August, where the number of competitors was reduced to 16, and concluded with a final on 13 August. As there were less than 32 boxers in the competition, a number of boxers received a bye for the preliminary round. All bouts consisted of three periods where the boxers received points for every successful punch they land on their opponent's head or upper body. The boxer with the most points at the end of the bouts wins. If a boxer is knocked to the ground and cannot get up before the referee counts to 10 then the bout is over and the opponent wins.

Reams of Verse

Reams of Verse (23 April 1994–2009) was an American-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare best known for winning the Epsom Oaks in 1997. In a racing career which lasted from July 1996 to October 1997 the filly ran nine times and won five races. Reams of Verse was one of the leading European two-year-old fillies of 1996 when she won three of her four races including the May Hill Stakes at Doncaster and the Fillies' Mile at Ascot. She was unplaced in the 1000 Guineas the following spring but then won the Musidora Stakes at York and the Classic Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom. She was beaten in her two remaining races, finishing fourth in the Yorkshire Oaks and third in the Sun Chariot Stakes.
Background.
Reams of Verse was a chestnut mare with a white star and one white sock, bred in Kentucky by her owner Khalid Abdulla's Juddmonte Farms. Reams of Verse was sired by the disqualified 2000 Guineas winner Nureyev out of the Roberto mare Modena. Apart from Reams of Verse, Nureyev was the sire the winners of at least forty-five Group One/Grade I including Peintre Celebre, Spinning World, Zilzal, Stravinsky and Miesque. His career as a stallion has been described as "outstanding". Modena had previously produced the Eclipse Stakes winner Elmaamul and was a half-sister to Zaizafon, the dam of the 2000 Guineas winner Zafonic. Another, half-sister, Midsummer, produced the racemare Midday, the winner of six Group One races.
Reams of Verse was sent to England for her racing career and was trained by Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stables at Newmarket, Suffolk.
Racing career.
1996: two-year-old season.
On her first appearance, Reams of Verse started 5/4 favourite for a seven furlong maiden race at Newmarket in July. She took the lead in the last quarter of a mile but was caught in the closing stages and beaten a neck by Ovation. In a similar event over the same course and distance a month later, Reams of Verse recorded her first win, beating Bint Baladee by a neck at odds of 4/7. In September, the filly was moved up in class and distance for the Group Three May Hill Stakes over one mile at Doncaster's St Leger meeting. Ridden by Pat Eddery, Reams of Verse took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by two lengths from Dame Laura. On her final appearance of the year, Reams of Verse was promoted to Group One level for the Fillies' Mile at Ascot, where she started third favourite behind her stable companion Sleepytime and the Prestige Stakes winner Red Camellia. Mick Kinane restrained the filly in the early stages before challenging for the lead in the straight. Reams of Verse went to the front a furlong from the finish and despite hanging to the right in the closing stages, she stayed on well to win from Khassah, with Sleepytime an apparently unlucky third.
1997: three-year-old season.
Reams of Verse missed the early trial races in 1997 as she had suffered from a cough and Cecil felt that she would be unsuited by the prevailing firm ground. She therefore began her three-year-old season in the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket on 4 May. She was not among the favourites, starting at odds of 11/1, and finished sixth of the fifteen runners behind Sleepytime. Nine days after her run at Newmarket, Reams of Verse was moved up to ten furlongs for the Musidora Stakes (a trial race for the Epsom Oaks) at York. She was ridden for the first time by Cecil's new stable jockey Kieran Fallon, who had been impressed by the filly's performances in training. Reams of Verse took the lead in the straight and drew clear of her opponents to win impressively by eleven lengths, and was immediately the subject of heavy betting for the Oaks three weeks later.
On 6 June at Epsom, Reams of Verse started 5/6 favourite for the Oaks against eleven other fillies, despite fears that her pedigree lacked the stamina influences needed for the race. Her main rivals in the betting were her stable companion Yashmak (winner of the Fillies' Trial Stakes) and the Irish-trained Ebadiyla. Reams of Verse was hampered in the straight as Fallon struggled to obtain room for a challenge, and had to switch to the outside. Once in the clear, the filly finished strongly to take the lead inside the final furlong and took the classic by one and a half lengths from Gazelle Royale and Crown of Light. After the race, Fallon claimed that he was never worried, as he trusted in the filly's "turn of foot" (acceleration).
After a break of well over two months, Reams of Verse reappeared against older fillies in the Yorkshire Oaks. She started 4/7 favourite, but was never able to reach the lead and weakened in the closing stages to finish fourth behind the four-year-old My Emma. After the race, Cecil expressed his view that the filly did not truly stay the mile and a half distance and that "it was only her class that got her through in the Oaks." Following another break, Reams of Verse ran in the Sun Chariot Stakes (then a Group Two race) at Newmarket in October. Fallon restrained the 9/4 favourite in the early stages before moving forward a quarter of the mile from the finish. Reams of Verse could make no further progress and finished third of the eight runners behind One So Wonderful.
Assessment and honours.
The independent Timeform organisation gave Reams of Verse a rating of 121.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Reams of Verse an "inferior" winner of the Oaks.
Stud record.
Reams of Verse was retired to become a broodmare for Juddmonte Farms. She had some success at stud, producing several winners including Eagle Poise, whose successes included the Valedictory Stakes at Woodbine Racetrack in 2011. Her son World Domination (by Empire Maker) was regarded as a potential classic winner in 2011, but did not live up to expectations. Her daughter Ithaca produced the Celebration Mile winner Zacinto.
2001 Ithaca (USA) : Chesnut filly, foaled 17 January, by Distant View (USA) - won 1 race and 2nd G3 Prestige Stakes, Goodwood; 3rd LR Distaff Stakes, Sandown; 3rd LR Sceptre Stakes, Doncaster from 10 starts in England 2003-04 - dam of Zacinto (GB) won G2 Celebration Mile, Goodwood
2003 General Knowledge (USA) : Chesnut gelding, foaled 25 April, by Diesis (GB) - won 3 races in France and England 2006-08

Perry Bhandal (born 12 January 1968) is a British film director, screenwriter, and producer of the film "Interview with a Hitman", which stars Luke Goss.
Early life.
Bhandal was born in Slough, England and is of Sikh heritage. He received a BSc from the University of Manchester and two M.A.s in Film & Creative Writing at the University of Brunel in Middlesex. Straight after Brunel he wrote, produced, directed & edited his first short film in 1991.
Career.
Bhandal continued writing after his short film completing a number of screenplays and dabbling in novel writing. In 2009 he decided to return to the film business proper. In May 2009 Bhandal set up the film production company "Kirlian Pictures Ltd" and began packaging and presenting the feature script "Penumbra". The size of the budget for this first feature led to pressure from Investors to hand over the directorial reigns to someone with a track record. Bhandal chose not to part with the project and instead set about developing a lower budget feature called "Interview with a Hitman".
Bhandal shot "Interview with a Hitman" in 18 days in August 2011 on location in Newcastle and Bucharest. The film had its market premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2012 and has gone on to sell in Major territories worldwide.
"Interview with a Hitman" was released theatrically in the UK on 20 July 2012. It was released in the US on 5 March 2013.
The film has achieved critical acclaim with Bhandal's distinctive style being particularly noted. On "Interview with a Hitman", Bhandal shot all of the film digitally so that he could achieve more depth and detail during the scenes as the vast majority of the film is set at night.
Bhandal is currently working on his second feature "Penumbra".

Non-expanding horizon

A non-expanding horizon (NEH) is an enclosed null surface whose intrinsic structure is preserved. An NEH is the geometric prototype of an isolated horizon which describes a black hole in equilibrium with its exterior from the quasilocal perspective. It is based on the concept and geometry of NEHs that the two quasilocal definitions of black holes, weakly isolated horizons and isolated horizons, are developed.
Definition of NEHs.
A three-dimensional submanifold ∆ is defined as a "generic" (rotating and distorted) NEH if it respects the following conditions:
(i) ∆ is null and topologically formula_1;
(ii) Along any null normal field formula_2 tangent to ∆, the outgoing expansion rate formula_3 vanishes;
(iii) All field equations hold on ∆, and the stress–energy tensor formula_4 on ∆ is such that formula_5 is a future-directed causal vector (formula_6) for any future-directed null normal formula_7.
Condition (i) is fairly trivial and just states the general fact that from a 3+1 perspective an NEH ∆ is foliated by spacelike 2-spheres ∆'=S2, where S2 emphasizes that ∆' is topologically compact with genus zero (formula_8). The signature of ∆ is (0,+,+) with a degenerate temporal coordinate, and the intrinsic geometry of a foliation leaf ∆'=S2 is nonevolutional. The property formula_9 in condition (ii) plays a pivotal role in defining NEHs and the rich implications encoded therein will be extensively discussed below. Condition (iii) makes one feel free to apply the Newman–Penrose (NP) formalism of Einstein-Maxwell field equations to the horizon and its near-horizon vicinity; furthermore, the very energy inequality is motivated from the dominant energy condition and is a sufficient condition for deriving many boundary conditions of NEHs.
"Note": In this article, following the convention set up in refs., "hat" over the equality symbol formula_10 means equality on the black-hole horizons (NEHs), and "hat" over quantities and operators (formula_11, formula_12, etc) denotes those on a foliation leaf of the horizon. Also, ∆ is the "standard" symbol for both an NEH and the directional derivative ∆formula_13 in NP formalism, and we believe this won't cause an ambiguity.
Boundary conditions implied by the definition.
Now let's work out the implications of the definition of NEHs, and these results will be expressed in the language of NP formalism with the convention formula_14 (Note: unlike the original convention formula_15, this is the usual one employed in studying trapped null surfaces and quasilocal definitions of black holes). Being a null normal to ∆, formula_7 is automatically geodesic, formula_17, and twist free, formula_18. For an NEH, the outgoing expansion rate formula_19 along formula_7 is vanishing, formula_21, and consequently formula_22. Moreover, according to the Raychaudhuri-NP "expansion-twist" equation,
it follows that on ∆
where formula_25 is the NP-shear coefficient. Due to the assumed energy condition (iii), we have formula_26 (formula_27), and therefore formula_28 is nonnegative on ∆. The product formula_29 is of course nonnegative, too. Consequently, formula_29 and formula_28 must be simultaneously zero on ∆, i.e. formula_32 and formula_33. As a summary,
Thus, the isolated horizon ∆ is nonevolutional and all foliation leaves ∆'=S2 look identical with one another. The relation formula_35 implies that the causal vector formula_36 in condition (iii) is proportional to formula_7 and formula_38 is proportional to formula_39 on the horizon ∆; that is, formula_40 and formula_41, formula_42. Applying this result to the related Ricci-NP scalars, we get formula_43, and formula_44, thus
The vanishing of Ricci-NP scalars formula_46 signifies that, there is no energy–momentum flux of "any" kind of charge "across" the horizon, such as electromagnetic waves, Yang–Mills flux or dilaton flux. Also, there should be no gravitational waves crossing the horizon; however, gravitational waves are propagation of perturbations of the spacetime continuum rather than flows of charges, and therefore depicted by four Weyl-NP scalars formula_47 (excluding formula_48) rather than Ricci-NP quantities formula_49. According to the Raychaudhuri-NP "shear" equation
or the NP field equation on the horizon
it follows that formula_52. Moreover, the NP equation
implies that formula_54. To sum up, we have
which means that, geometrically, a principal null direction of Weyl's tensor is repeated twice and formula_7 is aligned with the principal direction; physically, no gravitational waves (transverse component formula_57 and longitudinal component formula_58) enter the black hole. This result is consistent with the physical scenario defining NEHs.
Remarks: Spin coefficients related to Raychaudhuri's equation.
For a better understanding of the previous section, we will briefly review the meanings of relevant NP spin coefficients in depicting null congruences. The tensor form of Raychaudhuri's equation governing null flows reads
where formula_60 is defined such that formula_61. The quantities in Raychaudhuri's equation are related with the spin coefficients via
Moreover, a null congruence is "hypersurface orthogonal" if formula_68.
Constraints from electromagnetic fields.
Vacuum NEHs on which formula_69 are the simplest types of NEHs, but in general there can be various physically meaningful fields surrounding an NEH, among which we are mostly interested in electrovacuum fields with formula_70. This is the simplest extension of vacuum NEHs, and the nonvanishing energy-stress tensor for electromagnetic fields reads
where formula_72 refers to the antisymmetric (formula_73, formula_74) electromagnetic field strength, and formula_4 is trace-free (formula_76) by definition and respects the dominant energy condition. (One should be careful with the antisymmetry of formula_72 in defining Maxwell-NP scalars formula_78).
The boundary conditions derived in the previous section are applicable to generic NEHs. In the electromagnetic case, formula_49 can be specified in a more particular way. By the NP formalism of Einstein-Maxwell equations, one has
where formula_81 denote the three Maxwell-NP scalars. As an alternative to Eq(), we can see that the condition formula_82 also results from the NP equation
It follows straightforwardly that
These results demonstrate that, there are no electromagnetic waves across (formula_87, formula_88) or along (\Phi_{02}) the NEH except the null geodesics generating the horizon. It is also worthwhile to point out that, the supplementary equation formula_89 in Eq() is only valid for electromagnetic fields; for example, in the case of Yang–Mills fields there will be formula_90 where formula_91 are Yang–Mills-NP scalars.
Adapted tetrad on NEHs and further properties.
Usually, null tetrads adapted to spacetime properties are employed to achieve the most succinct NP descriptions. For example, a null tetrad can be adapted to principal null directions once the Petrov type is known; also, at some typical boundary regions such as null infinity, timelike infinity, spacelike infinity, black hole horizons and cosmological horizons, tetrads can be adapted to boundary structures. Similarly, a "preferred" tetrad adapted to on-horizon geometric behaviors is employed in the literature to further investigate NEHs.
As indicated from the 3+1 perspective from condition (i) in the definition, an NEH ∆ is foliated by spacelike hypersurfaces ∆'=S2 transverse to its null normal along an ingoing null coordinate formula_92, where we follow the standard notation of ingoing Eddington–Finkelstein null coordinates and use formula_92 to label the 2-dimensional leaves formula_94 at formula_95; that is, ∆=∆'×[v0,v1]=S2×[v0,v1]. formula_92 is set to be future-directed and choose the first tetrad covector formula_97 as formula_98, and then there will be a unique vector field formula_7 as null normals to formula_94 satisfying the cross-normalization formula_101 and affine parametrization formula_102; such choice of formula_103 would actually yields a preferred foliation of ∆. While formula_104 are related to the extrinsic properties and null generators (i.e. null flows/geodesic congruence on ∆), the remaining two complex null vectors formula_105 are to span the intrinsic geometry of a foliation leaf formula_94, tangent to ∆ and transverse to formula_104; that is, formula_108.
Now let's check the consequences of this kind of adapted tetrad. Since
with formula_110, we have
Also, in such an adapted frame, the derivative formula_112 on ∆'×[v0,v1]=S2×[v0,v1] should be purely intrinsic; thus in the commutator
the coefficients for the directional derivatives formula_114 and ∆ must be zero, that is
so the ingoing null normal field formula_116 is twist-free by formula_117, and formula_118 equals the ingoing expansion rate formula_119.
Discussion.
So far, the definition and boundary conditions of NEHs have been introduced. The boundary conditions include those for an arbitrary NEH, specific characteristics for Einstein-Maxwell (electromagnetic) NEHs, as well as further properties in an adapted tetrad. Based on NEHs, WIHs which have valid surface gravity can be defined to generalize the black hole mechanics. WIHs are sufficient in studying the physics on the horizon, but for geometric purposes, stronger restrictions can be imposed to WIHs so as to introduce IHs, where the equivalence class of null normals formula_120 fully preserves the induced connection formula_121 on the horizon.

United States Air Force Plant 4

Air Force Plant 4 is a government-owned, contractor-operated aerospace facility in Fort Worth, Texas, currently owned by the U.S. Air Force and operated by Lockheed Martin Aeronautics. It is home of the F-16 and F-35 fighter aircraft. Military aircraft have been manufactured here since 1942. Plant 4 is adjacent to Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, formerly Carswell Air Force Base. 
Overview.
Air Force Plant 4 is one of the largest employers in the area with a staff of approximately 17,000 people. Air Force Plant 4 is located within the Fort Worth-Arlington Metropolitan Statistical Area which includes Johnson, Parker and Tarrant Counties. The area is characterized as a highly urbanized area with a diverse economic base concentrated in the manufacturing, service and retail industries. With a large number of defense industries and their associated supply and service businesses, the community has been greatly affected by the recent reduction in defense expenditures.
History.
Plant 4's origins begin in May 1940 when the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce was trying to convince aircraft manufacturers to build an aircraft assembly plant in the Fort Worth area to support the massive expansion of the Army Air Corps.
Fleet and Consolidated Aircraft, wanting to build in the area, suggested to the Air Corps that they jointly build an airfield adjacent to the heavy bomber plant they wanted to build in Fort Worth. It was suggested that the Air Corps would benefit by having a joint facility. Local officials promised to spend money to build an airport on the land next to the plant and lease it to the Air Corps. After some objections to this, another suggestion to deed the Air Corps the land was made was accepted, and on 16 June 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved $1.75 million to construct a military airfield (Fort Worth Army Airfield]) next to the Consolidated manufacturing plant.
World War II.
The B-24 Liberator was first proposed to the Air Corps in 1938, and with the start of World War II in Europe, the French Government placed an order for 60 aircraft, sight unseen. In 1940, Britain ordered 164. These large foreign orders were placed well before the US military placed similar-sized orders, and played a large role in getting the B-24 project going. 
In order to meet the projected demand for the B-24, in early 1941 the government established the Liberator Production Pool Program. Under this program, Consolidated would produce Liberators at the new plant in Fort Worth to supplement the B-24 production in its main San Diego plant. Sub-assemblies and components of B-24Ds would first be sent to Fort Worth and assembled from smaller plants until Fort Worth could produce the complete aircraft. Three designations of the Liberator, B-24D, B-24E, and B-24G would be flown to Fort Worth from Consolidated production lines in San Diego, Willow Run, Michigan and North American Aircraft in Dallas. At Fort Worth, the aircraft would be processed though what was called a "modification center" where the aircraft would be updated with the latest modifications before being turned over to the Air Force and flown out from the Fort Worth Army Airfield, which it shared a common airfield with. Over 3,000 B-24 aircraft were manufactured, assembled and modified during the war. 
In February 1943, the Army directed Consolidated to shift its production of the B-32 Dominator very heavy bomber from San Diego to Fort Worth, to streamline PBY Catalina production in San Diego for the Navy. The B-32 program, however, was beset with technical problems and by the end of December 1944, only five aircraft had been delivered. In comparison, the B-29 Superfortress had been in combat for nearly six months. Before the program's termination in September 1945, only 124 B-32s were produced in Fort Worth.
Cold War.
In 1942, Consolidated decided to manufacture its very long range bomber, the XB-36 Peacemaker in Fort Worth. Although the USAAF approved this plan, it caused a delay of several months in the XB-36 project, since all the drawings, the mockup, the engineers, and the tooling had to be moved from San Diego to Texas. Unfortunately, progress on the XB-36 was still slow, and by the middle of 1944, B-29s were attacking Japan regularly from bases in the Mariana Islands. Although the B-36 project would still continue, it would now do so with a lower priority. Following the surrender of Germany and the end of the war in Europe, aircraft production contracts were drastically cut back. However, the contract for the B-36 was untouched. The enormous losses suffered in seizing island bases in the Pacific convinced that USAAF that there was still a definite need for a long-range bomber.
The first XB-36 (42-13570) was rolled out of the Fort Worth factory on 0 September 1945, and took off from Fort Worth on its maiden flight on 8 August 1946, The B-36 was in production at Fort Worth until the last B-36J was rolled out on 14 August 1954. 385 of these were ultimately built. 
Consolidated Aircraft became Convair, following a merger in 1943. Convair was itself acquired by General Dynamics in 1953. Beginning in the late 1940s, Air Materiel Command, requested that work begin on a new jet- powered medium bomber that would be ready for service by the late 1950s. After years of development, a medium jet bomber Covair's XB-58, was accepted by the Air Force in December 1955 for thirteen aircraft, which would be built at Plant 4 in Fort Worth. Technical problems and testing by Air Force Systems Command meant that the first production aircraft were not delivered until 1959. The aircraft remained in production until 1964 when the Air Force decided to phase the aircraft out of the inventory. 
The company's proposal for the Tactical Fighter Experimental project (TFX) was accepted in 1962, with the fighter seeing production as the General Dynamics F-111. By 1966, the plant had expanded to 4.7 million square feet, and by 1968 it had expanded further to 6.5 million square feet, to accommodate production of the F-111. Plant 4 built 562 of the aircraft by the time production ended, in 1976. 
In the early 1970s, the YF-16 was designed and built at Fort Worth, and the USAF accepted its first F-16 on August 17, 1978. The Fighting Falcon is one of the most successful military aircraft ever produced, with major production continuing until the early 2000s and support components of the aircraft still being produced. 
Current use.
When General Dynamics sold its aircraft manufacturing interests to Lockheed Martin it included the operation of Plant 4, which eventually would house Lockheed Martin Aeronautics' divisional headquarters. As of the end of the Cold War, the plant was fabricating, assembling, and testing the F-16 for the USAF and 10 allied nations. In March 1992 Lockheed began to produce F-22 Raptor aircraft components at the facility. Additionally, the plant produces spare aircraft parts, radar units, and missile components.
Today the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter is being produced on the assembly line at the plant.
Pollution.
Air force Plant 4 has been listed as a Superfund site since 1990. It was discovered a significant TCE plume had contaminated local soil and groundwater. Remediation efforts are still underway.

The various species had bullet-shaped heads, and curved, crushing jaws.
Species List.
As was mentioned, all known species are from the German Kellwasserkalk facies. Denison (1978) says that the various species need to be revised, as many of the species were originally described as specimens of other species. Obruchev (1932) and Miles (1969) placed "Leiosteus" (="Erromenosteus") within Pachyosteidae (before Pachyosteidae was merged into Selenosteidae). Now, though, "Erromenosteus" is considered a basal member of Dinichthyloidea.

901st Tactical Airlift Group

The 901st Tactical Airlift Group is an inactive United States Air Force Reserve unit. It was last active with the 433d Airlift Wing, based at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado. It was inactivated on 1 April 1985.
History.
Following the mobilizations in 1961 and 1962 for the Berlin Crisis and the Cuban Missile Crisis, Continental Air Command (ConAC) realized that it was unwieldy to mobilize an entire wing unless absolutely necessary. Their original Table of Organization for each Wing was a wing headquarters, a troop carrier group, an Air Base Group, a maintenance and supply group, and a medical group. In 1957, the troop carrier group and maintenance and supply groups were inactivated, with their squadrons reassigned directly to the wing headquarters - despite the fact that many wings had squadrons spread out over several bases due to the Detached Squadron Concept dispersing Reserve units over centers of population. 
To resolve this, in late 1962 and early 1963, ConAC reorganized the structure of its reserve Troop Carrier Wings by establishing fully deployable Troop Carrier Groups and inserting them into the chain of command between the Wing and its squadrons at every base that held a ConAC troop carrier squadron. At each base, the group was composed of a material squadron, a troop carrier squadron, a tactical hospital or dispensary, and a combat support squadron. Each troop carrier wing consisted of 3 or 4 of these groups. By doing so, ConAC could facilitate the mobilization of either aircraft and aircrews alone, aircraft and minimum support personnel (one troop carrier group), or the entire troop carrier wing. This also gave ConAC the flexibility to expand each Wing by attaching additional squadrons, if necessary from other Reserve wings to the deployable groups for deployments. 
As a result, the 901st Troop Carrier Group was established with a mission to organize, recruit and train Air Force Reserve personnel in the tactical airlift of airborne forces, their equipment and supplies and delivery of these forces and materials by airdrop, landing or cargo extraction systems. The group was equipped with C-119 Flying Boxcars for Tactical Air Command airlift operations.
The 901st TCG was one of two C-119 Flying Boxcar groups assigned to the 94th TCW in 1963, the other being the 902d Troop Carrier Group at Grenier AFB, Massachusetts. Re-equipped 1966 with long-range C-124 Globemaster heavy airlifter, performed intercontinental strategic airlift for Military Air Transport Service.
Re-aligned back to TAC, 1972, equipped with UC-123 Provider assault transports in support of USAF Southern Command. Also assumed an aerial spraying mission which frequently took wing crews to Central America, the Caribbean, the Azores, North Africa, islands of the Pacific, and to many U.S. points for insect-spraying missions. Inactivated 1974 as part of post-Vietnam War drawdown. 
Re-activated October 1982, equipped with C-130B Hercules transports. Trained for tactical airlift missions, participating in joint training exercises. Inactivated April 1985, personnel and equipment to 302d Tactical Airlift Wing.

Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine

The Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine is McMaster University's medical school, located in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. It is operated by the McMaster Faculty of Health Sciences. It is the third largest medical school in Canada, and is one of two medical programs (along with the University of Calgary) in Canada that operates on an accelerated 3-year program, without interruption for the summer, instead of the traditional 4-year MD Program.
The school was founded in 1966, and began its first classes in 1969. The school is widely acknowledged to be a world leader in innovative learning and testing systems. Since its formation, the school used small-group, case-based learning, instead of the traditional lecture-exam model in its curriculum. This educational model, colloquially known as the McMaster Model, would later become formally known as problem-based learning, having an enormous global impact on medical education and redefining the way medicine is taught to learners. McMaster also developed the MMI or Multiple Mini Interview system for medical school admissions which has been adopted all over the world. 
Facilities and Teaching Sites.
The school is located at McMaster University's main campus in Hamilton, Ontario, housed within the Michael G. DeGroote Centre for Learning and Discovery, and the adjacent Health Sciences Centre. The DeGroote facility is shared with the Centre for Function Genomics, Centre for Gene Therapeutics, Institute for Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Research, Robert E. Fitzhenry Vector Laboratory, Centre for Asthma and Allergy Research (Allergen) and North American Headquarters for West Nile studies, as well as the Bachelor of Health Sciences undergraduate program.
The Health Sciences Centre/McMaster Children's Hospital is a multi-use research facility and pediatric teaching hospital. The hospital is home to the second-largest neonatal intensive care unit in Canada, and the third largest child and youth mental health unit in the country.
The medical school currently operates three campuses; the main Hamilton campus, as well as the Waterloo Regional Campus and the Niagara Regional campus, located in Waterloo, Ontario and Niagara, Ontario respectively. All three campuses offer the same curriculum and lead to the same degree, but differ in patient populations and teaching locations.
The school is affiliated with the following Ontario hospitals, where students rotate and train during their clerkship:
Educational Influence.
The medical school is a pioneer in its teaching and admissions philosophies through the Program for Educational Research and Development, renowned internationally for grounding educational practice in evidence. McMaster created a revolution in health care training by pioneering the problem-based learning (PBL) curriculum, which has since influenced health care education worldwide. The instructional strategy focuses on student-driven learning, which occurs in groups, to foster critical thinking, higher retention, and stronger cognitive competencies including coping with uncertainty and communication skills. Most medical schools in Canada and more than 80% of medical schools in the United States now employ PBL in their curriculum, and many international universities are continuing to do to the same.
In the early 1990s, the School of Medicine developed the personal progress index (PPI) as an objective method for assessing acquisition and retention of knowledge for students in the medical program. The PPI is administered at routine intervals to all students in the program, regardless of their level of training, and plots students' increases in scores as they move through the program. Students typically score under 15% on their first write, and increase 5-7% with each successive write. Students are able to monitor the changes in their scores and receive formative feedback based on a standardized score relative to the class mean. Due to the overwhelming success and research supporting the use of the PPI as an evaluation tool, it is now used in Canada, US, Europe, and Australia.
In 2004, McMaster developed the multiple-mini interview to address long standing concerns over the standard panel interviews as being poor reflectors of performance in medical school. This format uses short, independent assessments in a timed circuit to obtain aggregate scores in interpersonal skills, professionalism, ethical/moral judgment, and critical thinking to assess candidates. The MMI has consistently shown to have a higher predictive validity for future performance than traditional interviews. By 2008, the MMI was being used as an admissions test for the majority of medical schools in Canada, Australia, and Israel, as well as other medical schools in the United States and Asia.
In 2010, McMaster began using a computer-based simulated test known as CASPer as an admissions tool at the pre-interview stage. This is an assessment of interpersonal and decision-making skills that is more reliable, and predicts much more validity than standard autobiographical submissions. The test involves several video clips lasting 1–2 minutes in length, followed by situational challenges and self-descriptive questions that may or may not be related to the preceding video clip.
Rankings.
McMaster University currently ranks 1st in Canada in clinical, pre-clinical, and health universities, and 14th worldwide, according to the 2012 Times Higher Education Rankings.
In the field of clinical medicine and pharmacy, the ARWU in 2012 ranked the program 46th in the world and third in Canada. In the 2012 QS World University Subject Ranking for medicine, McMaster University ranked 30th worldwide and 3rd in Canada.
Admissions.
Admissions into Canadian medical schools is highly competitive, typically requiring a bachelor's degree, a strong undergraduate grade point average (GPA), and strong scores on the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT).
The annual success rate for all applicants applying for admission to McMaster University's medical school is 4.8%. Applicants are required to have at least three years of prior university education, and are required to write the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT). They are also required to complete a 90 minute computer-based test to assess interpersonal skills and decision-making.
Interview offers for Ontario medical schools are typically given in January and February. Applicants go through the Multiple Mini Interview format, a 10-station interview circuit, to increase the validity and reliability of interview scores (see above).
Curriculum.
The program is divided into two parts: the pre-clerkship curriculum and the clerkship curriculum, each spanning half of the three years. The pre-clerkship curriculum is divided into five medical foundations, where students meet with a faculty member twice a week in a small group setting for teaching. Learning is done using the Problem Based Learning approach, where students set objectives, complete independent research, and then use their small group sessions to teach others, ask questions, and challenge one another with the guidance of their tutor. Students also complete clinical skills and professional competencies training at this time.
The clerkship curriculum consists of rotating schedule, where students will move through various medical disciplines. These include Internal Medicine, Family Medicine, Emergency Medicine, Pediatrics, Surgery, Psychiatry, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Anesthesia, as well as a number of elective blocks for specialties of interest for the student. In their third year, students apply to the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS) for residency training after completion of the MD Program.

Capital punishment in Syria

Capital punishment is legal in Syria. Syria continues to perform public executions, and is one of the last five countries to do so, the others being Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and North Korea. The sole method of execution under Syrian law is hanging. Current laws allow the death penalty for treason, murder, political acts such as bearing arms against Syria in the ranks of the enemy, desertion of the armed forces to the enemy and acts of incitement under martial law or in wartime, violent robbery, rape, membership of the Muslim Brotherhood, and drug trafficking.

Second Street Bridge (Allegan, Michigan)

The Second Street Bridge is a one-lane, single-span truss bridge in Allegan, in the U.S. state of Michigan, that carries Second Street over the Kalamazoo River. It is a Michigan State Historic Site, a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Built in 1886, the bridge replaced an earlier wooden structure. In the early 1980s, the bridge underwent significant renovation.
History.
Prior to construction of the current structure, the river was spanned by a wooden bridge which had been in use for about fifty years. By the mid-1880s, the bridge had fallen into disrepair. The "Allegan Journal and Tribune" reported in March 1886 that "The structure miscalled a bridge ... is nearly buried in liquid mud, which serves to cover up some of the holes. We hope steps will be taken to secure an iron bridge before the old one tumbles down."
The replacement bridge was designed by Zenas King, founder of the King Iron Bridge Company, and the company began construction in 1886. The bridge was completed in two and a half months owing to fear that the wooden structure might collapse. Construction cost $7,532.25 and the bridge opened to traffic in late September. The bridge was one of the largest built by the company.
In 1979, a structural analysis of the bridge indicated that the wrought iron was in good shape, but the deck was deteriorating. City officials chose to rehabilitate the bridge instead of replacing it because the structure is historic and further study showed that traffic problems would be exacerbated by replacing it with a two-lane structure. Because the bridge was not a critical transportation corridor, the city persuaded the federal government to fund rehabilitation, even though the project would not meet AASHTO standards. The project was approved in part because the bridge was made one-way to overcome the limitations of its narrow roadway. Funding was received in 1981, and the contract was awarded to low bidder H&K Construction for $552,000, compared to an estimated $1.2 million for replacement.
For rehabilitation, the 80-ton bridge was rolled ashore on a system of rails, pulled by a hydraulic crane winch. After erecting scaffolding, the bridge was disassembled and members shipped to Holland, Michigan, for repairs and painting. New components were manufactured in Grand Rapids. All components were tested by dye penetration and ultrasound to ensure their soundness. The bridge was then reassembled and rolled back over the river. In June 1983, the bridge's reopening was celebrated by a three-day "Bridgefest". At some point after rehabilitation, traffic lights were installed, permitting the resumption of two-way traffic on the now one-lane bridge.
Since 1995, the bridge has featured in the logo of the city of Allegan.
Historic designations.
The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 11, 1980. In 1982, the American Society of Civil Engineers designated it as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. On September 8, 1982, the bridge was designated a Michigan State Historic Site and an informational marker was erected in 1984.
Design.
The Second Street Bridge has a single-span Whipple truss design, made of steel and iron. The bridge is wide and spans over the Kalamazoo River with of water clearance. Its abutments are made of granite fieldstone. The structure is decorated with lattice work, iron end post finials, and latticed metal handrails. On one side of the bridge is a pedestrian walkway with wood flooring.

Elyasin community

Elyasin Community ( also known as Ale Yasin or Elahyoun) is an Iranian spiritual_cultural community founded by Peyman Fattahi since 1991. The community is a coalition of individuals, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), magazines and publishing houses which aims raising public awareness in field of spiritual and applied matters.
Elyasin has been working in a range of activities since the 1990s; such as holding lectures and public speeches of its founder (Peyman Fattahi, well known as Master Elias M. Ramollah), publishing books and magazines, research, training its members on thinking and writing methods, as well as holding workshops. According to the latest published news (on 2009) Elyasin community has around 200,000 members.
Elyasin Community members believe in and emphasize on reconciliation of religions and faiths as well as Union of the Civilizations, a matter of which has caused them being seriously persecuted by Iranian Government since 2007.
History of activities and affiliated institutions.
Elyasin Community was founded by Peyman Fattahi on early 1991. Its activities have been based on spiritualism ever since. There are several publishing houses, magazines and cultural institution affiliated to Elyasin Community some of which can be noted as follow,:
Magazines: Arts of Living, Esoteric Knowledge, Motivators, Science of Success, Art of Transcendental Life, and Sublime Thinking.
Institutions: Avamer-e-Yasin, Science of Success, Association of Free Thinkers and Researchers, Nature Front Association, Yasin Society of Writers and Researchers (Payam), Professional Management Research Group, Elyasin Human Rights and International Affairs.
Publishing houses: Divine Guidance (Taalime Hagh), Haa-Mim, Ya-hou, Vassama.
Persecution by Iranian Government.
Since established, Elyasin Community has been working without dependency to any political party or group and its activities were mainly focused on research and studying of cultural-spiritual subjects. After the first detention of Peyman Fattahi by Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of Iran on June 2007, most of the institutions and NGOs working under his supervision directly or indirectly, were closed down and their authorities and members were prosecuted or detained in charge of propaganda against Islamic Government of Iran. The incident has happened since Ahmadinejad’s presidency and restrictions are still ongoing.
Regarding the conflicts of Iranian Government against Elyasin Community, the website of Radio Zamaneh wrote:
"During the past 30 years, such prosecutions have been spread to non-religious minorities due to the theocratic feature of Iranian Regime. Serial assassination of scholars of Association of Writers, security activities of Saeed Emami’s Sect and Shariatmadari's gangs against intellectuals, production and broadcasting of the 'Hovyiat' TV series, television confessions, and formation of various suppressive organizations such as 'Ershad' and 'Forbidding what is Evil' are examples of such Cultural Talibanic Policy in Iran. Elyasin Community has been one of the most recent victims of the 'policy of persecution of dissident minorities' in Iran. After taking power, the Mahdist (Messianic) Shiite Sect has spent large sum of money to spread superstitious beliefs throughout the Iranian society, i.e. the budget for Jamkaran Well, and claiming to manage the country by Imam Mahdi's guidance, but, yet they insist to call the dissidents as 'sect'. The security-cultural system of Iranian government is trying to accuse Elyasin Community of religious innovation and assigning them to 19th century religious movements in Iran."
On spring 2009, simultaneous with the Iran presidential election, nearly 200 members and representative of Elyasin went on a hunger strike at Ayatollah Khomeini’s tomb as a protest against detention of their leader (Peyman Fattahi) and prosecution of other members of the community.
The leader of Elyasin Community (Peyman Fattahi) has been detained on 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2012 and spent totally 400 days in solitary confinement at 209 ward of Evin Prison.

<doc id="36765525" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36765525" title="NATGRID">
NATGRID

The National Intelligence Grid or NATGRID is an integrated intelligence grid that will link the databases of several departments and ministries of the Government of India so as to collect comprehensive patterns of intelligence that can be readily accessed by intelligence agencies. It was first proposed in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on Mumbai in 2008 and is to become operational in 2013.
Reason for establishment.
The 26/11 attacks on Mumbai led to the exposure of several weaknesses in India's intelligence gathering and action networks. NATGRID is part of the radical overhaul of the security and intelligence apparatuses of India that was mooted by the then Home Minister P. Chidambaram. The National Investigating Agency and the National Counter Terrorism Centre are two organisations established in the aftermath of the Mumbai attacks of 2008. Before the attacks, the American Lashkar operative David Coleman Headley had visited India several times and done a recce of the places that came under attack on 26/11. Despite having travelled to India several times and having returned to the US through Pakistan or West Asia, his trips failed to raise the suspicion of Indian agencies as they lacked a system that could reveal a pattern in his unusual travel itineraries and trips to the country. It is argued that had a system like the NATGRID been in place, Headley would have been apprehended well before the attacks.
Structure and Functions.
NATGRID is an intelligence sharing network that collates data from the standalone databases of the various agencies and ministries of the Indian government. It is a counter terrorism measure that collects and collates a host of information from government databases including tax and bank account details, credit card transactions, visa and immigration records and itineraries of rail and air travel. This combined data will be made available to 11 central agencies, which are: Research and Analysis Wing, the Intelligence Bureau, Central Bureau of Investigation, Financial intelligence unit, Central Board of Direct Taxes, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Enforcement Directorate, Narcotics Control Bureau, Central Board of Excise and Customs and the Directorate General of Central Excise Intelligence.
NATGRID is being implemented in four phases, the first two of which will be operationalised by 2014 at a cost of 1,200 crores and the first data sets will be retrievable by early 2013. The Cabinet Committee on Security approved the first two phases in 2011. The same year, P. Raghu Raman was appointed the Secretary and CEO of NATGRID and tasked with the establishment of the grid. The implementation of the third and fourth phases are expected to require amendments to several laws to allow for the sharing and transfer of data on items such as property and bank transaction details and internet usage. 
Unlike the NCTC and the NIA which are central organisations, the NATGRID is essentially a tool that enables security agencies to locate and obtain relevant information on terror suspects from pooled data of various organisations and services in the country. It will help identify, capture and prosecute terrorists and help preempt terrorist plots.
Opposition.
NATGRID faced opposition on charges of possible violations of privacy and leakage of confidential personal information. Its efficacy in preventing terror have also been questioned given that no state agency or police force has access to its database thus reducing chances of immediate, effective action. NATGRID claims to be protected by several structural and procedural safeguards and oversight mechanisms including that of external audits and technology safeguards.
