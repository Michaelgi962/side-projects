Ulagalantha Perumal Temple, Kanchipuram

Ulagalandha Perumal Temple, or Thiru Ooragam is a temple dedicated to Vishnu located in Kancheepuram, Tamil Nadu, India. It is one of the 108 Divya Desam Temples, revered by the "azhwars", Hindu poet saints of the 7th-10th century. This Divyadesam is found in Big Kanchipuram and is closely situated near to Sri Kamakshi Amman Temple.
Legend.
The "Bhagavata Purana" describes that Vishnu descended as the Vamana avatar to restore the authority of Indra over the heavens, as it had been taken by Mahabali, a benevolent Asura King. Bali was the grandson of Hiranyakshipu, the son of Prahlada. King Mahabali was generous, and engaged in severe austerities and penance and won the praise of the world. With the praise from his courtiers and others, he regarded himself as the all powerful in the world. Vamana, in the guise of a short Brahmin carrying a wooden umbrella, went to the king to request three paces of land. Mahabali consented, against the warning of his guru, Sukracharya. Vamana then revealed his identity and enlarged to gigantic proportions to stride over the three worlds. He stepped from heaven to earth with the first step, from earth to the netherworld with the second. King Mahabali, unable to fulfill his promise, offered his head for the third. Vamana then placed his foot and gave the king immortality for his humility. In worshiping Mahabali and his ancestor Prahláda, he conceded sovereignty of Pátála, the netherworld. Some texts also report that Vamana did not step into the netherworld, and instead gave its rule to Bali. In giant form, Vamana is known as Trivikrama. The legend is associated with the Thrikkakara Temple in Kerala and also with this temple and Ulagalantha Perumal Temple, Tirukoyilur.
Description.
The temple has an area of about and has a three tiered "rajagopuram"(main towers). The temple houses 4 "divya desams" on it own - they are Thirukkarvaanam, Thirukaaragam, Thiruooragam and Thiruneeragam. The temple is revered by the verses of Tirumangai Alvar and Thirumazhisai Aazhwar. Thaayar of the temple is Amudhavalli (Amirthavalli),Utsavaar of the temple is Sri Loganathan. Deity is known as ThiruVikraman, Ulagalantha Perumal in a Standing Posture West Facing while Goddess is AmuthaValli.
A description of Thiruvikrama Over 30 feet in height Left leg is seen lifted at a right angle(to the body), parallel to the ground.
Right leg is seen placed on Mahabali’s head 2 fingers on his left hand stretched out referring to the two steps he took to measure this world 1 stretched finger on his right hand indicates the question the Lord posed to MahaBali as to where he could place his 3rd step.
The gigantic Ulagalantha Perumal is special to Kanchipuram and a Lord of this size, and in this form, cannot be seen in any other Divya Desam.
Inscriptions.
The core of the temple is of Pallava vintage going by the main deity but inscriptions are only from the Chola period. Most of the inscriptions are from the Chola period. The inscriptions refer to the main deity as Thiru Uragathu Ninru-arulina Swamin. There are interesting inscriptions from the period of Rajakesarivarman alias Tribhuvanachakravarthin Kulothunga Chola. The inscription talks of a tax-free gift to the temple of the village of Siruchembakkam that was renamed as Kampadevinallur after his queen who requested this gift to be made. Another inscription of the same dynasty records a weaver who reclaimed some temple lands, built an irrigation tank and had the proceeds donated to the deity.
There is a reference to Rajakesarivarman re-possessing the land given earlier to the weavers in the area since they did not cultivate it and returned it to the temple. This proves that the weavers were a prosperous group in ancient Kanchipuram. Another interesting inscription in the reign of Rajadhirajadeva records the minutes of a meeting of 48,000 residents of Kanchi who agreed to celebrate functions in the temple as per tradition. This gives an indication of the population of the town in the 13th century.
The Sambuvarayar rule of the 16th century records the gift of a pond and a grove in Sevvanmedu village. The temple still continues to possess this grove.

Recording and structure.
The mellotron played by Maurice Gibb, the low voices by Barry and Robin Gibb on the intro was featured on this song. This track was recorded in March 23 same day as they recorded "Please Read Me" "Life" (unreleased) and "In My Own Time". It was also released as the B-side of "Holiday" in Australia on October 1967 and US on September 1967. Though it was not released as a single anywhere, it appeared on the 1969 compilation "Best of Bee Gees".
Maurice Gibb talks about the mellotron on this track:
We started off with a mellotron and we used that on "Every Christian Lion Hearted Man Will Show", I had to repeat that on stage, but i used an organ.
At the intro of the song, it features a low vocal by Barry and Robin, no instruments was featured, only the orchestra, the line was "Oh solo dominique", it was repeated four times. On the chorus, the only line was "every christian lion hearted man will show you", features a low harmony by Barry and high harmony by Robin. The line "Oh solo dominique" was featured again at the end of the song.
Music critic Bruce Eder describes this track as "close in spirit to the Moody Blues of this era, opening with a Gregorian chant backed by a mellotron, before breaking into a strangely spaced-out, psychedelic main song body."

Muslim Students Association of South Africa

The Muslim Students Association of South Africa is a representative collective of the various Muslim Students Association (MSA) chapters which can be found in the different tertiary institutions throughout South Africa.
History.
The once strong Muslim Students Association of South Africa (est. 1974), which had branches on many tertiary campuses, became less vocal and thus lost its grip on student activities; the MSA was thus replaced by Islamic societies that were either independent or affiliates of other Muslim organizations outside these institutions. The Muslim Students Association of South Africa has recently been very active once again. The first National Muslim Students Association of South Africa Conference (first in the last 10 years) was held in Durban in January 2004. MSA representatives from all over the country met here. This was hoped to be a new future of student work in the country.
MSA Chapters in South Africa.
The following MSA chapters are found in South Africa
TUKS MSA - University of Pretoria
UCT MSA - University of Cape Town
UKZN MSA - University of KwaZulu Natal
UJ MSA - University of Johannesburg
UWC MSA - University of the Western Cape
US - University of Stellenbosch
MSA RHODES - University - Grahamstown
PUKKE MSA - North West University - Potchefstroom Campus
CPUT MSA - (Cape Peninsula University of Technology - (Bellville Campus)
MSA National Camp.
An annual camp is usually held in KwaZulu Natal where all members of MSA's across the country are invited to participate in discussion around issues affecting MSA's in general, as well covering aspects of Muslim Leadership in the South African context.
The Message Magazine.
The Message Magazine is currently (2009) a national student magazine, produced and published by MSA members from many different universities. It began (2001) as a monthly newsletter by the MSA at the University of Natal - Durban and was edited and produced by Bilal Randeree and Mariam Jhaveri. By 2003, the newsletter had become a full colour glossy magazine, still produced out of Durban, but with contributors and distribution nationally.

Rawla Mandi

Rawla Mandi (in Hindi and Rajasthani:- रावला मंडी, in Punjabi:- ਰਾਵਲਾ ਮਂਡੀ, in Sindhi:- راولا منڊي) is a small town in Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan, India. It is located on Gharsana-Khajuwala road, 24 km away from Gharsana and 180 km from the district headquarters Sri Ganganagar. The state capital Jaipur is 480 km away, and national capital New Delhi is 600 km away. It is 55 km from Anupgarh, 33 km from Khajuwala and 122 km from Bikaner.
Geography and climate.
Rawla Mandi is in the Thar Desert. Thorny shrubs and sandy dunes are the basic characteristics of this region. Kikar("Acacia"), Aak ("Calotropis procera"), Khejari ("Prosopis cineraria"), Khimp ("Leptadenia pyrotechnica"), Lathiya, "Laana" and Booiin ("Aerva tomentosa") make natural vegetation of this area. According to experts Rawla area is enriched with fertile soil for crops. Gypsum rocks are assets of this region. The waters of Ignp canal has brought changes to flora and fauna and agriculture of wheat, mustard, cotton, Guar, pulses and Jawar has given a composite form of sandy dunes and green fields. It should be noted that this region with Gharsana is called cotton-belt but now things are changing. Average annual rainfall has fallen dramatically in the last few years. Since key source of irrigation is canal-water, water supply is inadequate for agriculture. Now many farmers are moving to a new trend of irrigation by tubewells.
Governance.
Rawla Mandi is currently a gram panchayat local government. The present sarpanch is Dr. Sirjeet Singh Baroka (elected on 23 January 2010). Pawan Kumar is serving as vice-sarpanch who is also ward panch from ward no. 5. Total ward members are listed below:-
Chaks of Rawla mandi.
10 KD,9 PSD (A), 10 KPD and 4KPD are neighbouring "grampanchayats" of Rawla Mandi "grampanchayat".
History.
Timeline.
In 1982 a new grain market was established. Rawla began to expand and the golden period of Rawla began. On 19 August 1987 a number of illegal shops were demolished by the administration and people showed strong resistance. Earlier Rawla Mandi was a part of Rojari gram panchayat and in 1988 it was given grampanchayat status. Gangabishan Poonia was elected as first Sarpanch on 1 June 1988. Hardworking and dedication changed the life of the people of Rawla. By 2000 Rawla began to decline due to droughts and lack of water in the canal. Many residents left the town and the people became hopeless and sad. The people of Anoopgarh, Gharsana, Khajuwala and Rawla Mandi started a movement against state government. The people of Rawla were demanding sufficient water for agriculture. According to them government had discriminatory attitude between people of first phase and second phase of Ignp irrigation system but government was claiming due to bad rain conditions water supply in Ignp canal had decreased and water was being given as per proportion of both phases. Rawla came into the news when this peasant movement became violent when a gathering of farmers entered a police station and set it afire on 27 October 2004. Three persons Kaluram, Mangilal, and Rajkumar died in police firing. A curfew was imposed on the area.
At present the shortage of water for agriculture is the most serious challenge for the people of Rawla Mandi. Now again due to positive rain conditions and water supply in the canal again this area is moving on the path of progress.
Road divider and road lights were introduced in 2011.
2012:- Rawla Mandi Sub-Tehsil is being set up and Rawla mandi will be the headquarters of this sub-tehsil.
In 2013 area east to Rojari road (for example ward no. 11 etc.) given back to 9 psd a grampanchayat. Many years ago it was added to 8 psd b grampanchayat.

John Welsh (diplomat)

John Welsh (November 9, 1805 - April 19, 1886) was an American merchant and minister to England.
Biography.
His ancestors were among the early Swedish and English settlers in America. His father, also named John Welsh, moved from the state of Delaware to Philadelphia in 1786, and soon became a prominent merchant in that city.
His father trained John and his brothers Samuel and William to mercantile life, and gradually introduced them to his business. John was the youngest, received a good preparatory education, including a classical course, but began the mercantile business, in which he was remarkably successful, at a very early age. He formed a partnership with his brothers, Samuel and William, and for more than half a century the firm of S. & W. Welsh, and later S. & J. Welsh, was among the leading commission houses in Philadelphia, and familiarly known all over the country.
In addition to the cares of his large business, Welsh became interested in public affairs and in the charitable institutions of his native city. During the last twenty-five years of his life he was an influential leader in all the great movements having for their object the promotion of the public good of his community. He was a vestryman in St. Peter's Protestant Episcopal Church forty-two years, and was treasurer of the fund of that denomination for the support of the episcopate. Taking a very active interest in founding the Episcopal hospital, he made himself responsible for the entire building fund amounting to $331,000, of which he personally contributed $41,000. He was one of the founders and became president of an association which raised a fund for the benefit of merchants who met with reverses in business.
In 1864 Mr. Welsh was chairman of the executive committee of the great sanitary fair held in Logan Square, Philadelphia, which raised $1,500,000 in money and supplies for the promotion of the health and comfort of soldiers and sailors in the United States Army and Navy. He distinguished himself as chairman of the board of finances of the Centennial International Exhibition of 1876, which position he held from the time of the creation of the board by act of congress in 1873, until the adjustment of all the accounts in 1877. He comprehended its importance and possessed the insight to appreciate its moral and material significance. After the exhibition closed, the board of directors, in recognition of his services, voted him a gold medal, and a number of prominent persons presented him $50,000 as "a perpetual commemoration of the sincere gratitude of the citizens of Philadelphia." With this fund, he founded the John Welsh chair of history and English literature in the University of Pennsylvania.
On October 30, 1877, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Welsh minister to the United Kingdom, which he held until his resignation, August 31, 1879. He was instrumental in securing the release of a number of Fenian prisoners. As the representative of the United States, he paid to the British government $5,500,000 awarded by the Halifax Fisheries Commission.
Upon his return home, he passed the remainder of his life in retirement. For 20 years he was a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, and during that period contributed $80,000 to its endowment fund. He also gave $10,000 to the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. He was made Knight-Commander of the Order of St. Olaf by the king of Sweden, and Commander of the Order of the Rising Sun by the Emperor of Japan, and Grand Officer of the Order of Nizan Iftakan by the bey of Tunis. The degree of LL.D. was conferred upon him by the University of Pennsylvania in 1878, and by Washington and Lee University in 1880. He died in Philadelphia April 19, 1886.
Family.
His son, Herbert Welsh, was prominent as a civil service reformer and Indian rights activist.

Sbiba () is a city surrounded by chains of mountains in the province of Kasserine.
Geography.
The city is located at the site of the ancient city of Sufes at the altitude of 630m. By the city is located the Mount Jbel Mghuila which is the highest peak in the region with 1370m.
Economy.
The city is famous for its apples, tomatoes and fresh water. Sbiba is producing nearly 40% of the Tunisian total production of apples and tomatoes due to its very advanced system of irrigation. Unfortunetely, despite its mass population (about 55000 inhabitants), Sbiba still suffers from the lack of national and international investments in the fields of industry, agriculture and especially services.

Sbiba is a city in the Midwest of Tunisia on the latitude of 35° and 36°, about 70 km far from Kasserine, bounded on the north with Jeddelienne, Sbeitla to the South. Sbiba is first founded by the Romans.

Recs of the flesh

recs of the flesh is a noise rock band from Sardinia. The band consists of Massimo Usai (electric guitar/vocals), Sara Melis (keyboards), Petr Studihrad (drums) and Federico Loche (bass guitar).
The band started out as a solo project in 2004, when Massimo Usai sought an outlet for his vision-driven high temperature fever, inspired by William S. Burroughs' novel The Soft Machine. Their sound has been compared to bands such as Sonic Youth, Killing Joke, Queens Of The Stone Age and Placebo in reviews All band members met on the internet, with the notable exception of Massimo and Sara, who met while Usai was working as a sound tech at a drag queen show in summer 2006. Xavier was found drumming on his YouTube channel [http://www.youtube.com/user/xevifoo while Justin and Massimo met at the official Sonic Youth Gossip Boards.
In 2010, Massimo and Sara moved to Prague, where Usai was granted access to Faust Records studios for an internship. The duo encountered drummer Petr Studihrad as he was recording for local punk legends Visací zámek. Highly impressed by his skills, Usai asked Studihrad to perform on recs of the flesh's new album. After listening to some rough demos, Studihrad agreed and joined the band. Bass player Federico Loche was asked to join the line-up shortly before the sessions for the second album were completed.
Music.
recs of the flesh has a sound based on dissonant guitar riffing, distorted keyboards, hard pounding drum lines, a very present bass and an urgent vocal delivery. Their songs, while dealing with experimental sound textures, apply to a somewhat standard verse/chorus/verse structure. The themes treated in lyrics often refer to psychological conditions and confusional states of the mind.
After several different line up changes and the recording of two demo CDs - Introducing Apophenia (2006) and Cigarette Secrets (2007) - Usai and Melis started preproduction for a full length release in early 2008. The band recorded their first full length album, "Illusory Fields Of Unconsciousness", during August 2008, when Dilme traveled from his native Catalunya to Sardinia, in order to lay down the drum lines in the band's home studio, The Crimson Dome. In the meanwhile, Wood started working on bass in St. Paul, Minnesota. The band was able to put together the tracks via online tools such as videocalls and instant messaging services.
The band's second album, "The Threat Remains And Is Very Real", had drums recorded by Petr Studihrad in Prague at Faust Records with the help of Recording engineer Derek Saxenmeyer during September 2010, with all other instruments recorded in Sardinia. Usai handled bass as well as guitars and vocals, while Melis handled keyboards and helped with the arrangement of vocal harmonies.
The sound presented in their albums has been described as a blend of several genres, and found the press dealing with the heavy delivery of the band's tonal explorations: "It's not often these days that an album hits as hard as this one.

Tiru Parameswara Vinnagaram

Thiru Parameswara Vinnagaram or Vaikunta Perumal Temple is a temple dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu, located in Kanchipuram in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the "Divya Prabandha", the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th–9th centuries AD. It is one among the 108 "Divyadesam" dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Vaikuntanathan and his consort Lakshmi as Vaikundavalli.
The temple is believed to have been built by the Pallava king Nandivarman II (720-96 CE), with later contributions from Medieval Cholas and Vijayanagar kings. The temple is surrounded by a granite wall enclosing all the shrines and water bodies of the temple. Vaikuntanathan is believed to have appeared to king Viroacha. The temple follows Vaikasana Agama and observes six daily rituals and two yearly festivals. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.
Legend.
As per Hindu legend, the region where the temple is located was called Vidarbha Desa and ruled by a king named Viroacha. Due to his misdeeds in preceding birth, Virocha had no heir. He prayed in Kailasanathar Temple and Shiva, the presiding deity of the temple gave a boon that the Dvarapalas (the gatekeepers) of the Vishnu temple will be born as sons to him. The princes were devoted to Vishnu and conducted yagna for the welfare of the people of their kingdom. Vishnu was pleased with the worship and appeared as Vaikundanatha to the princes.
Temple.
As per Dr. Hultzh, Parameswara Vinnagaram was constructed by the Pallava King Nandivarman II in 690 CE, while other scholars place it in the late 8th century. Pallavamallan was a worshipper of Vishnu and a great patron of learning. He renovated old temples and built several new ones. Among the latter was the Parameswara Vinnagaram or the Vaikunta Perumal temple at Kanchipuram which contains inscribed panels of sculpture portraying the events leading up to the accession of Pallavamalla to the throne. The great Vaishnava saint Thirumangai Alvar was his contemporary.
Three sanctuaries host the image of Vishnu in different postures - seated (ground floor), lying (first floor; accessible to devotees only on ekadashi days) and standing (second floor; inaccessible to devotees). The logical and complex plan of the temple provided a prototype for the much larger shrines to be constructed all over Tamil Nadu. The external cloisters, for instance, with their lion pillars, are predecessors of the grand thousand pillared halls of later temples.
This temple is revered in "Nalayira Divya Prabandham", the 7th–9th century Vaishnava canon by Thirumangai Alvar in 10 hymns. The temple is classified as a "Divyadesam", one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the Vaishnava canon. The temple is one of the fourteen "Divyadesams" in Kanchipuram and is part of Vishnu Kanchi, the place where most of the Vishnu temples in Kanchipuram are located.
Festivals and religious practices.
The temple follows Vaikasana Agama. The temple priests perform the "pooja" (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. Like other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day: "Ushathkalam" at 7:30 a.m., "Kalasanthi" at 8:00 a.m., "Uchikalam" at 12:00 p.m., "Sayarakshai" at 5:00 p.m., "Irandamkalam" at 6:00 p.m. and "Ardha Jamam" at 7:30 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: "alangaram" (decoration), "neivethanam" (food offering) and "deepa aradanai" (waving of lamps) for both Vaikuntanathan and Vaikundavalli. During the last step of worship, religious instructions in the "Vedas" (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The Vaikasi Brahmotsavam, celebrated during the Tamil month of "Vaikasi" (May-June), and Vaikunta Ekadashi celebrated during the Tamil month of "Margazhi" (December-January) are the two major festivals celebrated in the temple. Verses from "Nalayira Divya Prabandham" are recited by a group of temple priests amidst music with "nagaswaram" (pipe instrument) and "tavil" (percussion instrument).

Wing of the Villa Thiene (Cicogna)

The Wing of the Villa Thiene is a construction designed by Andrea Palladio located in Cicogna, a hamlet in the "comune" of Villafranca Padovana in the Veneto region of Italy.
The "barchessa" (wing) which exists today was only part of an ambitious project drawn up by Andrea Palladio for Francesco Thiene and his sons Odoardo and Teodoro. 
History.
In "I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura" (1570) Palladio declares that it was Francesco who initiated building works, and since he died in 1556 it is probable that Palladio’s project must have been conceived previously. In 1563 building works were in full swing, and a map dating from the following year well represents the state of the works which would halt in 1567, when Odoardo hastily abandoned Vicenza fleeing into Protestant territory for religious reasons.
Andrea Palladio was probably Odoardo’s personal friend, since he actually assisted him at the alarming moment of his flight, and witnessed the notarial act which nominated Odoardo’s brother Teodoro trustee of the properties he necessarily abandoned behind him.
The project for Villa Thiene is documented by an engraving in the "Quattro Libri": decidedly ambitious, it was characterised by a great loggia with a giant order, enclosed between towers arranged at the building’s four angles. A drawing by Marcantonio Palladio of the realised "barchessa" exists, which is extremely close to the executed form. 
Both "barchesse" of the project should have been connected to the lordly house by two curvilinear porticos, identical to those designed by Palladio in 1554 for the Villa Badoer at Fratta Polesine.

Creta et Cyrenaica

Creta et Cyrenaica was a senatorial province of the Roman empire created in 20 BC. It comprised the island of Crete and the region of Cyrenaica in north Africa (mod. E. Libya).
History.
Marcus Antonius Creticus attacked Crete in 71 BC and was repelled. Rome then sent Quintus Caecilius Metellus with three legions to the island. After a ferocious three-year campaign Crete was conquered for Rome in 69 BC, Metellus earning the agnomen "Creticus" for his efforts. At the archaeological sites, there seems to be little evidence of widespread damage associated with the transfer to Roman power: a single palatial house complex seems to have been razed. Gortyn seems to have been pro-Roman and was rewarded by being made the capital of the joint province of "Creta et Cyrenaica".

Willi van Ooyen

Willi van Ooyen (born 23 February 1947 in Weeze) is a German politician of the socialist Linke Party, and current leader of the Linke party's bloc in the Hessian Landtag. He is a self-described "Marxist".
Life.
Van Ooyen is the oldest of seven children. As a teenager he studied to be an electrician in the employ of the West-German Bundesbahn. He married in 1972, and moved to Frankfurt am Main where he studied history and education for a time at Johann Wolfgang Goethe University.
Political career.
In the mid-1960s when he was a teenager, van Ooyen started his lifelong affiliation with various far-left political groupings and causes. He was certainly in the thick of the so-called '68 Generation.
In organized politics, his first major position was Hessian leader of the Marxist German Peace Union (Deutsche Friedensunion, DFU) as managing director—a partial successor of the banned Communist Party of Germany — in 1976. The GPU was always a minor party, and it changed its status to "political union" in 1984, the same year that Willi van Ooyen became federal leader of the party across the whole of West Germany. This organisation was mainly founded by East Germany.
He became affiliated with the new socialist party in Germany, Die Linke, in 2007, and was nominated as their candidate for minister-president in the 2008 Hessian state election. The Linke party won 5.1% of the vote and entered the Landtag.
The reason for the Hessian political crisis of 2008 (See Landtag of Hesse) was fundamentally the existence of the Linke bloc in the Landtag. Andrea Ypsilanti, leader of the SPD, had promised several times during the electoral campaign not to work together with the new leftist party Die Linke (The Left). A few weeks after election day, she was tempted to go for a SPD–Green coalition supported by The Left but under opposition from MP Dagmar Metzger (SPD) decided not to renege on her promise not to pursue such a venue. After a second unsuccessful attempt by Ypsilanti to take power, all parties agreed to dissolve the Landtag and call for early elections on January 18, 2009.
In the uproar in 2008, many German commentators played up the fact that the German Peace Union, of which vanOoyen was a longtime member and eventual federal leader, had been guided, advised, and financed by the East German communist government. The communist government had showered praise upon the German Peace Union while it still existed, and heavily funded it during the van Ooyen years and earlier. Van Ooyen defended his status as a beneficiary of communist funds in the 1970s–1980s by saying he was "naive".
He was again the Linke party's candidate for minister-president in the 2009 Landtag election in Hesse, where his party again won 6 seats.

The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms

The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms, with Observations on their Habits (sometimes shortened to "Worms") is an 1881 book by Charles Darwin on earthworms. It was his last scientific book, and was published shortly before his death (see Darwin from Insectivorous Plants to Worms). Exploring earthworm behaviour and ecology, it continued the theme common throughout his work that gradual changes over long periods of time can lead to large and sometimes surprising consequences. It was the first significant work on soil bioturbation, although that term was not used by Darwin (it first appeared in the soil and geomorphic literature one hundred years later).
Paper "On the Formation of Mould".
After returning from the "Beagle" survey expedition in October 1836, Darwin was intensively occupied with further establishing his reputation as an innovative geologist, as well as finding suitable experts to describe his natural history collections and arranging for publication of their work as the multi-volume "Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle". Near the outset of the voyage he had planned a book on geology, and during it extracts from his letters on geology had been privately published by his tutor John Stevens Henslow. Darwin now published papers on "proofs of recent elevation on the coast of Chili", "deposits containing extinct Mammalia" and "coral formations". He also rewrote his journal to incorporate observations from his notebooks as the book now called "The Voyage of the Beagle", and began brainstorming in his notebooks about transmutation of species.
Darwin’s health suffered from the pressure of work, and on 20 September 1837 having been urged by his doctors "knock off all work" he visited his home in Shrewsbury then went on to stay with his relatives at Maer Hall, Staffordshire, home of his uncle Josiah Wedgwood. Uncle Jos pointed out an area of ground where lime and cinders spread years previously had vanished into the soil, forming layers under a top layer of loam. Jos suggested that this might have been the work of earthworms, but apparently thought that this would be of little interest to his nephew, who was working on continental scale geological problems. Actually, Charles did find it interesting and throughout his life he sustained an interest in this "unsung creature which, in its untold millions, transformed the land as the coral polyps did the tropical sea".
He returned to London on 21 October and prepared a paper on worms forming mould. The paper on the role of earthworms in soil formation was read out by Darwin at the Geological Society of London on 1 November 1837. This was an uncommonly mundane subject for the society, and his peers may have hoped to hear of something more grandiose, even seeing this paper as highlighting Darwin's growing idiosyncrasies. The leading geologist William Buckland subsequently recommended Darwin's paper for publication, praising it as "a new & important theory to explain Phenomena of universal occurrence on the surface of the Earth—in fact a new Geological Power", while rightly rejecting Darwin's suggestion that chalkland could have been formed in a similar way.
The paper appeared in the "Proceedings of the Geological Society of London" in 1838, and was published with a woodcut illustration in the "Transactions of the Geological Society" in 1840.
Renewed work on earthworms.
From his brainstorming about transmutation towards the end of 1838, Darwin conceived of his theory of natural selection "by which to work", as his "prime hobby". His main work on the "Beagle" collections continued, and in 1842 he published the first of three volumes on geology, "The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs". He then allowed himself to write out the first "pencil sketch" of his theory. Subsequently, in September 1842, the family moved to rural Down House where he had space for experimental plant and animal breeding, and surroundings to observe nature. In December of that year he had a quantity of broken chalk spread over a part of a long established pasture field near the house, "for the sake of observing at some future period to what depth it would become buried."
In 1872 he was having disagreements with St George Mivart about "The Descent of Man". Darwin cut communication with Mivart and went the less controversial direction of the lowly worm. His network of correspondents and fans responded to his interest and "earthworm anecdotes began surfacing in his mountain of mail". He had been interested in earthworms "since his first fishing days at The Mount and flirting days at Maer". Still, other work constrained him. Broken off from "Descent", he had to finish his next work "The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals".
By 1876, with his first grandson on the way, he felt his writing life was nearly over, with so much unfinished. He wanted to write on earthworms "before joining them", but also had two more plant books in mind, and a revision of "Fertilisation of Orchids" to work on. He also began an autobiographical work intended for his family's eyes only. After turning away a request to support a controversial book on contraception ("Fruits of Philosophy") – Darwin was opposed to it – he got back to work on flowers and worms. As with much of his geological and evolutionary work, worms were a case of gradual, barely noticeable changes accumulating over time into large effects. He even went on a two-hour excursion to Stonehenge to see how its monoliths had been buried by earthworm castings.
He was occupied by worms at Downe in 1880, his work coming first. He had help from the family, even receiving soil samples from Abinger's Roman ruins. He told Vladimir Kovalevsky (his Russian translator) of slow progress with his new book.
Darwin calculated that there were 53,767 earthworms recycling away per acre. He carried out experiments indoors, where they worked the earth inside pots in a worm-littered room. He experimented with stimuli at night: strong light would send them into their burrows ("like a rabbit" said Darwin's grandson Bernard), but heat and sound had no effect. Their food preferences were also tested, raw carrots being their favourite.
Darwin was fascinated by their behaviour, from enjoying "the pleasure of eating" (based on their eagerness for certain foods) to their sexual passions, "strong enough to overcome... their dread of light", even to their social feelings ("crawling over each other's bodies"). Their foraging was especially intriguing: they dragged leaves into their burrows, pulling them in the most efficient way, by their pointed end. On these semi-intelligent creatures Darwin wrote that they obtained a "notion, however rude, of the shape of an object", perhaps by feeling it out. Worms, "five or six feet" below the ground ploughed farmers fields. Darwin felt we "ought to be grateful" to these little recyclers, which he compared to "a man... born blind and deaf". He was wondering how long it would be until he would be consumed by worms himself. It would surely be his last major work; he told German translator Victor Carus "I have little strength & feel very old".
By 1881 he was unable to summon the strength for revisions and handed "Worms" on to Frank. His health gave him troubles; he complained to his long-time friend Hooker that he looked forward to "Down graveyard as the sweetest place on earth." Concerned about the book he had been anticipating for decades, he hurried his publisher John Murray to hasten publication of "Worms" even at the risk of not making a profit.
At a dinner with Edward Aveling (soon the son-in-law of Karl Marx) and other atheists, he was asked how he had turned to such an "insignificant" subject as worms, to which he replied "I have been studying their habits for forty years." As with his religious views, the old naturalist did not see things the same way as Aveling. In Darwin's view, the "insignificant" was the foundation of much greater phenomena.
Summary.
Darwin writes that he has been interested in worms for a long time and has written on the subject before, but that his ideas have been criticised by others.
Worms are found in many places, from the forest floor to mountains, and in many locations around the world. Though they are considered terrestrial animals, they are really semi-aquatic, like other annelids; they die quickly in air but survive for months in water. Though inactive during the day, they sometimes come out of their burrows at night. They are eaten by thrushes and other birds in large numbers because they lie close to the surface. They have well developed muscular, nervous, circulatory and digestive systems, the latter being quite unique. Though eyeless, they respond to the intensity and duration of light. They also slowly respond to temperature. They have no hearing, but are sensitive to vibrations. Their sense of smell is feeble, but they are able to find their preferred foods. Omnivorous animals, they swallow much earth and extract food from it. Worms live chiefly on half decayed leaves, partially digested by a pancreatic solution before ingestion. This extra-stomachal digestion is not unlike that which Darwin had previously described as occurring in "Insectivorous Plants". The structure and physiology of the calciferous glands of earthworms are described. Many hypotheses had been advanced for their function; Darwin believed them to be primarily for excretion and secondarily a digestion aid.
Thin leaves are seized with the mouth, while thick ones are dragged by creating a vacuum. Leaves and stones are used to plug up the burrow. This may deter predators, keep out water and/or keep out chilled air (the latter is Darwin's preferred function). Leaves are dragged in mostly by the tips, which is the easiest way of doing it, but when the base is narrower the worms change behaviour. They drag pine needle clusters in by the base. Petioles are used to plug up burrows, and for food. Worms drag experimental triangles of paper by the apex most of the time, and do not rely on trial and error. Worms excavate burrows by consuming material or, preferably, pushing it away. They mainly consume soil for nutrients. They are found down to six or more feet, especially in extreme conditions. Burrows are lined, which serve several functions, and terminate in a chamber lined with stones or seeds. Worms are found all over the planet, some on isolated islands; how they got there is a mystery. Darwin draws on correspondence with people from around the world such as Fritz Müller in Brazil.
The amount of earth brought to the surface by worms can be estimated by the rate at which objects on the surface are buried and by weighing the earth brought up in a given time. Information from farmers on marl, cinders etc. sinking into the ground allowed Darwin to make calculations. He conducted a 29-year experiment on chalk at a field near his house. Objects of all sorts "work themselves downards" as farmers say. Large stones sink because worms fill up any hollows with castings, then eject them beyond the perimeter and the ground around them starts to rise. He visited Stonehenge and found some outer stones partly buried, the turf sloping up to meet them (see figure 7). Darwin weighed castings and had friends do so in other countries. He also weighed castings per unit area per year, then worked out how thick a layer castings would make, compared with rates of sinking. Additionally, he worked out casting weight per worm per year.
Worms have preserved many ancient objects under the ground. Darwin describes an ancient Roman villa in Abinger, Surrey. Worms have penetrated the concrete walls and even mortar. Similar subsidence occurred at Beaulieu Abbey, Hampshire, with worms penetrating gaps between the tiles. His sons Francis and Horace visited Chedworth Roman Villa in Gloucestershire, while William reported on Brading Roman Villa, Isle of Wight. Darwin goes into some detail on the well preserved ruins of Silchester Roman Town, Hampshire, with the help of the Rev. J. G. Joyce. Finally he discusses the case of the Viroconium Roman town ruins at Wroxeter, Shropshire, with the help of Dr. H. Johnson, who made observations including depth of vegetable mould. He concludes that both worms and other causes, such as dust deposition and washing down of soil, have buried such ruins.
Denudation (removal of matter to a lower level) is caused mainly by air and water movement. Humic acids generated by worms disintegrate rock; their burrowing behaviour speeds this up. But as the soil layer thickens, this process is slowed down. Worms swallow hard objects (e.g. stones) to aid digestion, which causes attrition to such objects. This has geological significance, especially for the smaller particles which otherwise are eroded very slowly.
Rain causes castings to move down an incline; Darwin worked out the weight moving a certain distance in a given time. Some also roll down, and collect in drains etc., or get blown. There is a greater effect on casting movement in the tropics, because of increased rain. The finest earth is washed away. Ledges on hillsides, formerly believed to be caused by grazing mammals, are partly due to casting accumulations. High winds, especially gales, are almost as effective as the slope/rain in moving castings. Crowns and furrows of formerly ploughed lands slowly vanish when under pasture, due to worms, but more slowly when there is no incline. Fine earth is washed down from slopes, making a shallow layer. Dissolving of chalk supplies new earth.
Darwin writes in the conclusion that worms "have played a more important part in the history of the world than most persons would at first suppose." They are important for many reasons, including their role in decomposition of rocks, gradual denudation of the land, preservation of archaeological remains, and improving soil conditions for plant growth. Despite their rudimentary sense organs, they show complex, flexible behaviour.
Reception.
"Worms" became available in October 1881 and sold thousands of copies in its first few weeks, despite Darwin's comment to Carus that it was "a small book of little moment". Darwin received a "laughable" number of letters containing questions, observations and ideas, even "idiotic" ones. A week's holiday with Emma in Cambridge was to follow. Darwin died the next year on 19 April 1882.

Norman Brown (motorcyclist)

Norman Brown, Jr. (1960 – 31 July 1983) was a professional motorcycle road racer.
Brown was born in Newry, County Down, Northern Ireland where his father, Norman Brown, Sr. ran a public house, "The Star Bar" or "Brown's Bar", overlooking the Clanrye River and Newry Town Hall. An alumnus of Newry High School, Brown, Jr. won the 1982 "Classic race" in the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy (TT). In 1983, he raised the TT lap record to 116.19 mph in the Senior Classic event for machines up to 1000cc.
Death.
He was killed during the British Grand Prix at Silverstone on 31 July 1983. When it began to rain he slowed, apparently due to mechanical problems. With greatly reduced speed he continued the lap to reach the pits. After exiting the Stowe he held to the inside line and was passed by multiple riders before being hit by Swiss rider (Peter Huber), whose view was obscured by the riders in front of him. The race was not stopped until multiple riders decided to enter the pits voluntarily. Both riders died as a consequence of their serious injuries.

The village in the historic Lower Lusatia region passed from the Kingdom of Bohemia to the Electorate of Saxony by the 1635 Peace of Prague. From 1740 it was a possession of the Saxon statesman Heinrich von Brühl, who had an extended Baroque palace built, where he received Elector Frederick Augustus II of Wettin and kept his famous Meissen "Schwanenservice" tableware of more than 2.000 pieces designed by Johann Joachim Kaendler. The palace was devastated by Prussian troops by the explicit command of King Frederick II of Hohenzollern during the Seven Years' War.
By the Final Act of the Vienna Congress in 1815 Pförten with Lower Lusatia fell to Prussia and before 1945 the area was part of Germany (see "Territorial changes of Poland after World War II"). The Brühl Palace, again ravaged by the Red Army, has in parts been rebuilt.

Sablatnig SF-8

__NOTOC__
The Sablatnig SF-8 was a training seaplane produced in Germany during the First World War. While Sablatnig's previous designs for the Imperial German Navy had often seen service as trainers, the SF-8 was purpose-built for this role, at Dr Sablatnig's suggestion. The SF-8 was similar to the firm's earlier designs: a conventional two-bay biplane with staggered wings of unequal span, with open cockpits in tandem. 
Operational history.
The Navy ordered three machines for evaluation (serials 2020–2022) in 1917, which were delivered on 17 January the following year. After evaluation at Warnemünde proved favourable, the Navy ordered the type into production, placing an order for 30 machines and allocating serial numbers 6001–6030 to the batch. It is unclear how many of these were produced or delivered before the end of the war.

Cappadocia (Roman province)

Cappadocia was a province of the Roman Empire in Anatolia (modern central-eastern Turkey), with its capital at Caesarea. It was established in 17 AD by the Emperor Tiberius (ruled 14-37 AD), following the death of Cappadocia's last king, Archelaus. 
Cappadocia was an imperial province, meaning that its governor ("legatus Augusti") was directly appointed by the emperor. During the latter 1st century, the province also incorporated the regions of Pontus and Armenia Minor.
History.
Roman ally.
Prior to direct imperial rule, Cappadocia was one of the successor kingdoms of Alexander the Great's empire. The Kingdom of Cappadocia was ruled by the Ariarathid dynasty from 331 BC until 95 BC. Under Ariarathes IV, Cappadocia first came into contact with the Roman Republic as a foe allied with Selecuid King Antiochus the Great during the Roman-Syrian War from 192-188 BC. 
Following Rome's victory over Antiochus, Ariarathes IV entered friendly relations with the Republic by betrothing his daughter to the king of Pergamum, a Roman ally. The Ariarathid kings would thereafter become an major ally of Rome in the East. The kingdom supported the Republic as a counterweight against the Seleucid Empire, which claimed dominion over the Cappadocian kingdom. Cappadocia would also support Rome in the Third Macedonian War against Perseus of Macedon from 171-166 BC. Rome's defeat of the Selecuids and Macedonia established the Republic as a major power in the eastern Mediterranean.
When King Attalus III (138-133 BC) died without an heir in 133 BC, he bequeathed the Kingdom of Pergamon to Rome. Eumenes III claimed the Pergamon throne, occupying the territory. In 130 BC, Cappadocian king Ariarathes V supported the Roman Consul Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus in his failed attempt to overthrow Eumenes III. Both Crassus and Ariarathes V fell in battle against Eumenes III. Ariarathes V's death resulted in his minor son, Ariarathes VI, occupying the Cappadocian throne. 
King Mithridates V of Pontus exerted control over Cappadocia by betrothing his daughter Laodice to Ariarathes VI. Mithridates V would later launch a military invasion of Cappadocia, forming the kingdom into a protectorate of the Kingdom of Pontus. Though nominally independent, Pontic influence over Cappadocia was continued by his son Mithridates VI of Pontus.
In 116 BC, the Cappadocian king Ariarathes VI was murdered by the Cappadocian noble Gordius on orders from Mithridates VI. Mithridates VI then installed his sister Laodice, Ariarathes VI's widow, as regent over for the infant Ariarathes VII, further solidifying Pontic control over the kingdom. After King Nicomedes III of Bithynia married Laodice, he tried to annex Cappadocia into his kingdom and deposed Ariarathes VII. Mithridates VI swiftly invaded, expelling Nicomedes III from the region, restoring his nephew Ariarathes VII to the Cappadocian throne, and returning Cappadocia to Pontus' sphere of influence. 
The Pontic king would later have Ariarathes VII murdered in 101 BC, with Mirthridates VI installing his eight-year old son Ariarathes IX on the Cappadocian throne as his puppet king. As a child, Ariarathes IX was unable to maintain control of the kingdom, with the Cappadocian nobles rebelling against his rule in 97 BC and naming Ariarathes VIII, son of the murdered Ariarathes VII, as king. Mithridates quickly put down the rebellion, exiled Arirarathes VIII, and restored his son to the Cappadocian throne.
Roman client kingdom (95 BC-14 AD).
In response to the turmoil in Cappadocia, in 95 BC king Nicomedes III of Bithynia sent an embassy to Rome, claiming dominion over the kingdom. Mithridates VI of Pontus likewise sent an embassy to Rome, seeking Roman approval of his dominion over Cappadocia. The Roman Senate, however, did not assign the kingdom to either. 
Instead, the Senate demanded both Pontus and Bithynia withdraw from Cappadocia and guarantee its independence. The Senate ordered Ariarathes IX deposed. With military support from the Roman governor of Cilicia Lucius Cornelius Sulla, Ariobarzanes I was installed as king of Cappadocia. With Ariobarzanes I installed on the throne in 95 BC, Cappadocia became a client kingdom under the Roman Republic.
In 93 BC, troops from the Kingdom of Armenia under Tigranes the Great, son-in-law of Mithridates VI, invaded Cappadocia at the behest of the Pontic king. Tigranes dethroned Ariobarzanes I, who fled to Rome, and crowned Gordius as the new client-king of Cappadocia. With Cappadocia as a client kingdom under Armenia, Tigranes created a buffer zone between his kingdom and the expanding Roman Republic. 
With Cappadocia secured, Mithridates invaded the Kingdom of Bithynia, defeating king Nicomedes IV in 90 BC. Nicomedes IV was forced to flee to Italy. A Senatorial delegation was sent east to restore both Nicomedes IV and Ariobarzanes I to their respective kingdoms. Though the Social War was still raging in Italy, Rome was able to successfully restore both kings due to the Republic's growing influence in the region.
Mithridatic Wars (88-63 BC).
In 89 BC, after having made peace arrangement with Rome and with Ariobarzanes I restored to the Cappadocian throne, Mithridates VI again invaded Cappadocia, reinstalling his son Ariarathes IX as puppet-king under Pontic rule. Mithridates' actions in Cappadocia sparked the First Mithridatic War (89-85 BC) between Rome and Pontus and its ally Armenia. 
Lucius Cornelius Sulla assumed command of the Roman war effort in 87 BC and soundly defeated Mithridates VI and his allies in 85 BC. His attention needed in Rome due to rising political challenges, Sulla imposed mild terms on Mithridates VI: Mithridates was to relinquish his control over Bithynia and Cappadocia, reinstating Ariobarzanes I and Nicomedies IV as Roman client-kings. In return, Rome allowed Mithridates VI to retain his rule over Pontus.
When Nicomedes IV died in 74 BC, he bequeathed the Kingdom of Bithynia to the Roman Republic. His death caused a power vacuum in Asia Minor, allowing Mithridates VI to invade and conquer the leaderless kingdom. With Mirthidates VI again having designs on Roman protectorates in Asia Minor, including Cappadocia, Rome launched the Third Mithridatic War to end the Pontic threat. Dispatching Consul Lucius Licinius Lucullus to Asia, Rome drove Pontus and its ally Armenia out of Asia proper, reasserting Roman dominance over the Asian client kingdoms by 71 BC and conquering Pontus in the process. When Mithridates VI fled to Armenia, Lucullus invaded the kingdom in 69 BC. 
Despite initial successes, Lucullus was unable to decisively end the war. By 66 BC, Mithridates VI and Tigranes were able to retake their respective kingdoms and Lucullus was recalled to Rome. The Senate then sent Pompey the Great to the East in order to bring the war to a close. Upon his defeat by Pompey, Mithridates VI again fled to Armenia. Tigranes, however, refused to receive him. Mithridates VI was then forced to flee north across the Black Sea to the Bosporan Kingdom under the rule of his son Machares, bringing the war to an effective end in 65 BC. 
When Machares refused to launch a new war against Rome, Mithridates VI had him killed and assumed the Bosporan throne for himself. While Mithridates VI was eager to fight the Romans once more, his youngest son Pharnaces II of Pontus was not and plotted to remove his father from power. His plans were discovered, but the army, not wishing to engage Pompey and his armies, supported Pharnaces. They marched on Mithridates VI and forced their former king to take his own life in 63 BC. Pharnaces II quickly sent an embassy to Pompey with offers of submission. Pompey accepted Pharnaces II's submission and, in returned, named Pharnaces II as the Roman client king of the Bosporan Kingdom.
With Mithridates VI absent from Asia Minor, Pompey officially annexed Bithynia, Pontus, and Cilicia in the Roman Republic as provinces. Invading Armenia in 64 BC, Tigranes surrendered to Pompey and become a client kingdom of Rome. With Armenia reduced, Pompey then traveled south and officially annexed the Roman client kingdom of Syria in the Republic as a province by deposing its king Antiochus XIII Asiaticus. Following the death of Ariobarzanes I, Pompey, as one of his final acts in the East before returning to Rome, installed his son Ariobarzanes II as the new Roman client king of Cappadocia. 
Ariobarzanes II reigned as Rome's client king until 51 BC when he was assassinated by forces loyal to the neighboring Parthian Empire. The Roman Senate declared his son Ariobarzanes III as his rightful successor and, with military backing from the Roman governor of Cilicia Marcus Tullius Cicero, installed him upon the Cappadocian throne. In 50 BC, Ariobarzanes III, aided by Cicero, discovered a plot by Athenais Philostorgos II, Ariobarzanes III's mother, to depose him and install his younger brother Ariarathes X as king. Together, Cicero and Ariobarzanes III banished Athenais, who was a daughter of Mithridates VI, from Cappadocia.
Roman civil wars.
Cappadocia became an important player during the Roman Republican civil wars. When Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon River in 49 BC and started his civil war, many members of the Roman Senate under the leadership of Pompey fled to the East. Cappadocian King Ariobarzanes III initially supported Pompey against Caesar, thankful for Pompey's support of his father years earlier. However, following Caesar's victory over Pompey at the Battle of Pharsulus and Pompey's subsequent assassination in 48 BC, Ariobarzanes III declared his loyalty to Caesar. Caesar subsequently named Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus as Roman governor of Asia to act as his chief lieutenant in Asia Minor while he traveled to Ptolemaic Egypt. 
With the Romans were distracted by civil war, Pharnaces II, the Roman client king of the Bosporan Kingdom and the youngest son of Mithridates VI, decided to seize the opportunity and conquered Colchis and Lesser Armenia (territories of the Roman province of Pontus). The rulers of Cappadocia and Galatia, Ariobarzanes III and Deiotarus respectively, appealed to Calvinus for protection and soon the Roman forces sought battle with Pharnaces II. They met at the Battle of Nicopolis in eastern Anatolia, where Pharnaces II defeated the Roman army and overran much of Cappadocia, Pontus, and Bithynia. 
After the defeating the Ptolemaic forces at the Battle of the Nile, Caesar left Egypt in 47 BC and travelled through Syria, Cilicia, and Cappadocia to face Pharnaces II. As Pharnaces II gained word of Caesar's approach with his veteran army, he sent envoys to seek a peace, which Caesar refused. Caesar met Pharnaces II at the Battle of Zela, decisively defeating the Pontic king and reassessing Roman dominance over Asia Minor. Upon his return to the Bosporan Kingdom, Pharnaces II was assassinated by his son-in-law Asander. In return, Caesar named Asander as the kingdom's new Roman client king. Caesar then incorporated Lesser Armenia into Cappadocia to serve as a buffer from Rome's interests in Asia Minor against future Eastern aggression. 
Caesar was assassinated on March 15, 44 BC, by the members of the Roman Senate, Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus chief among them. The "Liberators" then fled from Italy, assuming command of the Republic's eastern provinces and the eastern client kingdoms, including Cappadocia, in 43 BC. When Ariobarzanes III objected to the level of Roman intervention into his kingdom, Cassius had him executed and installed his younger brother Ariarathes X upon the Cappadocian throne in 42 BC. Later that year, following the defeat of Brutus and Cassius by the Second Triumvirate at the Battle of Philippi, Triumvir Mark Antony assumed command of the Eastern provinces and client kingdoms. In 36 BC, Antony executed Ariarathes X and installed Archelaus as the new Cappadocian client king. 
The Second Triumvirate expired in 33 BC, ending Antony's legal right to govern the Eastern half of the Republic. With the Triumvirate lapsed, the struggle for dominance between Antony and Octavian intensified. As Octavian built up his support in the West, Antony drew ever closer to Egyptian Queen Cleopatra. When Octavian declared war on Egypt, Antony, supported by the Eastern client kingdoms (including Cappadocia), went to Egypt's aid against Octavian. Octavian's victory over Antony at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC ensured Octavian's position as undisputed master of the Roman world. Traveling through Asia Minor and the Levant from Greece to Egypt, Cappadocian king Archelaus and the other Eastern client kings declared their loyal to Octavian. In return, Octavian allowed him and the other client kings to remain on their thrones.
When Octavian became "Augustus" as the first Roman Emperor in 27 BC, Cappadocia become an important and trusted Eastern client kingdom, maintaining its tributary independence under the reorganized Roman Empire. Archelaus became an important client king for Augustus' Eastern policy. Augustus considered Archelaus as a loyal ruler, making no commitment to convert Cappadocia into a direct province. As a reward for his loyalty, in 25 BC, Augustus assigned to Archelaus the territories of Cilicia along the eastern Mediterranean Sea and Lesser Armenia along the Black Sea. Augustus gave Archelaus these additional territories in order to eliminate piracy in the Eastern Mediterranean and to build a buffer between Rome and the Parthian Empire.
Roman province.
During the Principate.
Cappadocia remained an important and trusted eastern client kingdom under Emperor Augustus' reign. Rome's policy towards Cappadocia changed, however, following Augustus' death in 14 AD and the reign of Emperor Tiberius. Years earlier, Tiberius had been slighted by Archelaus when the Cappadocian king showed favor to Gaius Caesar, one of Augustus' grandsons and chief heirs. While Tiberius was in retirement on the Greek island of Rhodes from 6 BC to 2 AD, though the nominal commander of the Eastern half of the Empire, in 1 BC Archelaus recognized Gaius Caesar, then a military commander subordinate to Tiberius, as Augustus' true representative. Though Gaius Caesar was Augustus' preferred successor, his death in 4 AD while on military campaign in Armenia forced Augustus to adopt Tiberius and name him as his successor.
Assuming the Imperial throne in 14 AD, Tiberius set about a change in Rome's eastern policy. Wanting direct access to Cappadocia's resources and seeking to reduce Archelaus, Tiberius summoned Archelaus to Rome in 17 AD. At the time, Archelaus had governed Cappadocia as Rome's client king for over fifty-years. When he arrived in Rome, Tiberius accused Archelaus of harboring revolutionary schemes and imprisoned him, where he died of natural causes soon thereafter. 
Sending his adoptive son Germanicus to oversee Rome's affairs in the East, Tiberius then annexed Cappadocia directly into the Empire by reducing the kingdom into a Roman province. Tiberius awarded rule of the Roman client kingdom of Armenia to Archelaus' step-son Artaxias III and rule of the Roman client kingdom of Cilicia to Archelaus' son Archelaus II. Arriving in the East in 18 AD, Germanicus solidified Roman control over Cappadocia and the region. Under orders from the Emperor, Germanicus also annexing Cappadocia's southeastern neighbor, the client Kingdom of Commagene, into the Empire as a part of the province of Syria.
For much the 1st century AD, Polemon II of Pontus ruled as a Roman client king over the remnants of the former kingdom of Pontus (Lesser Armenia and Colchis). However, in 62 AD, the Roman Emperor Nero deposed him and annexed his kingdom into direct imperial ruled by incorporating his former territory into Cappadocia.
Bording the Euphrates river to the east, Cappadocia was the most eastern province of the Empire. Its capital, Caesarea (modern Kayseri), was located in more central Anatolia, further back from the Parthian frontier. Upon annexation, the province was governed by a governor of Equestrian rank with the title "Procurator". The Procutors commanded only auxiliary military units and looked to the Senatorial ranked Imperial Legate of Syria for direction. 
Following the Roman civil war of 69, the Emperor Vespasian upgraded the province to Senatorial rank, making its governor equal in rank with that of Syria. As a Senatorial province during the middle of the second century AD, Cappadocia retained a permanent military garrison of three legions and several auxiliary units, totally over 28,000 troops. The military presence in Cappadocia served as an important response force against invasions from the Parthian Empire and allowed the Roman's easy intervention into the affairs of their client kingdom of Armenia. 
The first Cappadocian to be admitted to the Roman Senate was Tiberius Claudius Gordianus, during the reign of Marcus Aurelius during the middle second century AD.
During the Dominate.
Following the provincial reorganization of Diocletian, the Pontic and Armenian territories were split off, and the province was reduced to the region of Cappadocia proper. It was headed by a "consularis" and came under the Diocese of Pontus. The province was the site of a great number of imperial estates, as contemporary legislation testifies. 
In the late 330s, the eastern half of the province was split off to form the provinces of Armenia Prima and Armenia Secunda. In 371, emperor Valens split off the south-western region around Tyana, which became Cappadocia Secunda under a "praeses", while the remainder became Cappadocia Prima, still under a "consularis". 
Byzantine Empire.
In the period 535-553, under emperor Justinian I, the two provinces were rejoined into a single unit under a "proconsul". Throughout late Roman times, the region was subject to raids by the Isaurians, leading to the fortification of local cities. In the early 7th century, the region was briefly captured by the Sassanid Empire. Following the eruption of the Muslim conquests, repeated raids devastated the region, which became a frontier zone under the new Byzantine "themata" of Anatolikon and Armeniakon.

Population displacements in Israel after 1948

Population shifts in Israel after 1948 refers to the movement of Jewish and Arab populations in the wake of Israeli independence and the outbreak of the 1948 War. Arab villagers who resettled in other locations in Israel after 1948 are often referred to as internally displaced Palestinians. Many fled during the war but later returned to their homes. The Palestinians say that Israelis drove them from out while Israel says most left of their own accord. From 1948 to 1951, mass immigration nearly doubled Israel's Jewish population.

Auguste Gaspard Louis Desnoyers

Auguste Gaspard Louis, Baron Boucher-Desnoyers (19 December 1779 in Paris – 16 February 1857), was one of the most eminent of modern French engravers.
Biography.
His father held the office of commissary-general in the military household of Monsieur, afterwards Louis XVIII, but through unforeseen misfortunes young Desnoyers was compelled to choose for himself a career. He elected entrance into the corps of engineers, but he devoted every moment he could spare from the study of mathematics to drawing. At the age of twelve, he was introduced to Lethière, who admitted him into his studio, where Desnoyers soon attracted notice. But the rapid progress he made in drawing was just the means to an end. This end was soon accomplished, for the engraver Darcis, who had seen a "Head of a Magdalen," which Desnoyers engraved on tin when scarcely ten years old, took him under his care, and employed him on the outlines of the plates after Carle Vernet, on which he was then engaged. In 1796 an engraving in the dotted style of a "Young Bacchante," from a drawing by Grevedon, met with a succeess far beyond the hopes of the young artist.
He next produced a number of small subjects of similar character, which were well received, and at the Salon of 1799 he exhibited his engraving of "Venus disarming Cupid," after Robert Lefèvre, which won a prize of 2000 francs. In this year he entered the studio of Alexandre Tardieu, where he made some studies in etching and line engraving; but an engagement to engrave Hilaire Ledru's "Pénibles Adieux" did not allow him to remain for any great length of time. The success of his line engraving of "Hope supporting Man to the Tomb," after a sketch by Caraffa exhibited at the Salon of 1801, procured him a commission to engrave for the Musée "La belle jardinière" of Raphael.
Just at this time Desnoyers was drawn in the conscription, and Lucien Bonaparte went to Napoleon I, his brother, to solicit the artist's exemption. "Has he worked hand in hand with the Republic?" asked the First Consul, in very bad humour. "Yes," said Lucien. "Well, then let him pay if he wishes to be replaced," abruptly replied Napoleon. The council of revision, however, fortunately deemed him unfit for military service, although his constitution left nothing to be desired.
From this time he rose rapidly to the first rank in his adopted art, and in 1806 gained the large gold medal for his engraving of the celebrated antique cameo of 'Ptolemy II. Philadelphus and Arsinoe," belonging to the Empress Josephine, which is now in the Hermitage Palace at St. Petersburg.
His next important work was the full-length portrait of the Emperor Napoleon in his coronation robes, after Gérard. This engraving was exhibited at the Salon of 1810, and for it Desnoyers received no less a sum than £2000, together with the return of the plate after 600 impressions had been made.
Also in 1810, he engraved a small portrait of the Empress Marie Louise, which has a curious history. The Austrian princess had not set foot on French soil when her portrait was being sold in Paris by thousands. The likenesses differed, but all were frightfully ugly. Napoleon in a rage sent in the middle of the night for Baron Denon, and commanded him to go instantly to Desnoyers and ask him to engrave the portrait of the future empress. "Round head, fair hair, high forehead," were the brief instructions sent to the artist, who worked day and night until, at the end of four days, a proof was ready for approval. The emperor thought it superb, and had already ordered its immediate publication, when he received a faithful miniature of the archduchess, which rendered an alteration of the plate imperative, for the face of the new empress, instead of being round, was a very elongated oval. Twenty impressions were made when Desnoyers again set to work, and the next day the authentic portrait of Marie Louise was in circulation throughout Paris.
The empire fell, but the talented engraver continued to enjoy the favour of the court, and held a position among engravers similar to that of Baron Gérard among painters, and of Baron Bosio among sculptors. Elected a member of the Institute in 1816, he was appointed engraver to the king in 1825, and created a Baron in 1828, receiving soon after the cross of an officer of the Legion of Honour. He engraved many of the masterpieces of the Louvre, but after 1848 he did but little, for age had enfeebled his hand and weakened his sight.
Desnoyers died in Paris on the 16th of February, 1857. He appears to the best advantage in his transcripts of the works of ancient masters, especially Raphael, whose characteristics he renders with the greatest truth and skill. His masterpieces are the "La Belle Jardinière" of Raphael, and the "Vierge aux rochers" of Leonardo da Vinci. But, although marked by exceptional talent, his line engravings lack the freedom and breadth that distinguish those he executed in the dotted style. The landscape backgrounds of his plates were for the most part engraved by Friedrich Giessler of Nuremberg.
Works.
Among Desnoyers's works the first place must be assigned to his engravings after the Madonnas of Raphael. These are as follow:

CD Jávea

Club Deportivo Jávea is an association football club from Spain. Founded in 1939, they are based 100 km from Valencia, and 80 from Alicante. They currently play in the Regional Preferente – Group 3.
History.
CD Jávea have been part of the community of Xàbia–Jávea for almost 75 years. Very much a provincial club, the rojiblancos have rarely breathed the purer air of the upper echelons of the Spanish league pyramid but have established themselves as one of the more progressive lower league clubs in the region. Occasional spells in the Third Division have interrupted an otherwise solid presence in the Valencian Regional Preferente, one of the more powerful regional set-ups in Spain.
CD Jávea were last promoted to the Third Division in the early 90s, and Within three years they were back in the Regional Preferente.
In 2001/02 CD Jávea finished second in group IV behind a very powerful 'B' side from Hércules CF but lost their play-off round to SD Sueca to miss out on promotion to the Third Division. Two seasons later, a late run of form from the rojiblancos put them in good stead to claim another play-off spot but just one point from the last two games meant that they finished four points off the zone in 5th spot.
In 2006/07 CD Jávea almost left the Regional Preferente but in the wrong direction in a chaotic season for the football club. Young manager Alberto Araujo was tasked with putting together an exciting side that could challenge for promotion but by late November the club was just above the relegation zone. The club's board acted with knee-jerk reaction and sacked Alberto and three key first-team players; amazingly they discovered their fate on regional radio and the club was set to self-destruct as players refused to train. Ultimately Alberto stayed on a club for another six weeks as the club sought to avoid controversy, a clause in the coach's contract citing right to dismissal if the club wasn't in the top ten by the season's midpoint. On 14 January 2007, CD Jávea drew 1–1 at CD Polop and sat in 15th spot. Alberto departed the club.
Former FC Torrevieja player Kenny Brown was sought after as a suitable replacement, having the sort of coaching credentials that would suit the ambitions of the club. However bureaucracy at the Federation meant that he wasn't permitted to assume responsibilities on match-day and coach Mitgeta took on a caretaker-coach role. Jávea won just once in 21 games between 5 November 2006 and 6 May 2007 and a 0–1 home defeat at the hands on UD Altea forced the rojiblancos into the drop zone. Yet somehow the players pulled themselves off their knees and carved out two remarkable wins, a 2–1 away victory at Albatera CF and a 4–2 home win over CD Polop on the last day of season which secured safety by two points.
At the end of the 2006/7 season, English businessman Mark Catlin was elected president of the club after having spent a period as 'commercial director'. Catlin moved enthustiastically to steady a ship sailing dangerously close to stormy waters.
In January 2008 CD Jávea were featured on British television in a Sky Sports special called "La Lower Liga" which explored the impact of the British ex-pat community on football on Spain's Costa Blanca. Whilst CD Jávea was heavily featured, the programme also featured Noel Williams who was playing for Second Division Elche CF at the time. A follow-up programme entitled "La Lower Liga: The Second Half" was broadcast in the summer of 2008. Also featured in the programmes were CD Jávea's international supporters club, the Peña Javeamigos.
As a consequence of the programmes, CD Jávea received well over 100 emails from players and coaches in the UK, including Football League side Southend United. A partnership agreement was signed in the summer of 2008 which resulted in three young Southend players flying out to the Costa Blanca to join CD Jávea for a six-month loan spell, although just one managed to last the entire period. No further contact has been made with the club with regards to this agreement since the end of 2008.
The 2009/10 season began with coach Kenny Brown leaving the club after just three games to take up an assistant manager position at Grays Athletic in the UK, hoping to help former team-mate Julian Dicks guide the club away from the Conference National relegation zone. Former player and captain Jose Luis Bisquert was appointed as head coach a few days later.
In October 2009 President Mark Catlin resigned from his position, citing broken promises made to him by the local council during the summer of 2009. (Catlin subsequently joined English League One side Bury as 'commercial director. However a group of local's came together to form a caretaker board to take responsibility for the running of the club. Through their hard work in promoting the club across the town, support for the club began to build again despite the lack of progress on the pitch. The club finished the 2009/10 season in 13th spot and, although relegation was ultimately avoided, it had come close for a few weeks during the late winter.
With the club in dire financial trouble, a policy of encouraging local talent was pursued and the squad was built around local players, many of whom had been released by other clubs in the area. The 2010/11 season began badly, the worst start for some time with five straight defeats and two draws saw CD Jávea firmly established at the very bottom of the table. The fans had to wait until late October for the club's first win of the season, a 3–2 home victory over U.D. Horadada and the 'rojiblancos' gradually lifted themselves away from the wrong end of the table with a series of much improved performances, including a 4–1 thumping of play-off contenders Hércules C.F. "B". The season continued to be a mixed bag of results, the most disappointing of all being the spineless 5–1 defeat at close rivals U.D. Altea who would finish the season as group champions and ultimately win promotion to the Third Division through the play-offs. CD Jávea finished the season in 11th spot with Armando Lemos hitting 11 goals of the club's 42 goals that season.
The 2011/12 season was ultimately one of the most successful seasons for almost a decade. With José Luis Bisquert still at the helm, the side started slowly with three successive draws and a defeat but a run of three consecutive wins including a stunning 4–0 away demolition of U.D. Aldaya saw the 'rojiblancos' quickly rise up the table and, despite the occasional wobble, mainly against the sides pushing for a play-off spot, the side made a serious bid for the top four. Indeed a run of six wins in seven games lifted the side into fourth spot and within a whisker of a play-off place. But then a miserable final run of five games without a win saw CD Jávea slip to 6th, including a 1–0 home defeat to relegated Torrent C.F. on the last day of the season, a loss that ended hopes of lasting the whole season undefeated at home. Yet, it was the club's highest finished since 2003 and promised much for the future.
Yet after a hint of what could be, the 2012/13 season delivered a campaign to forget, despite a promising start which saw CD Jávea in early contention for a play-off spot. The 'rojiblancos' drew 15 of their 34 games and won just two games in the second half of a season which included a depressing eleven game run without a win. The two victories - one at home against Racing Algemesi and the second away at UD Ondarense - would be against two sides who would ultimately be relegated, scant consolation for such a miserable season. CD Jávea finished 10th, twelve points clear of the relegation zone but there was an enormous 28 point gap between themselves and the play-offs. It was as if the club gave up once safety had been assured, thanks to a decent first half of the season which saw the club lose just three times. But the knowledge that the club could not have been relegated was scant consolation for poor performances in the latter half of the season.
With coach José Luis Bisquert able to add some experience to the side during the summer of 2013, including the arrival of Dani García from CD Dénia and Sergio Mesa from CD Llosa, the 2012/13 season would be very interesting. An unlucky opening day defeat at CD Dénia was followed by an eight-game unbeaten run in which Dani García would score four goals, including two stunning strikes that would have been worthy of a greater stage.
Stadium.
The Campo d'Esports Municipal is owned by the local council. The main football pitch is synthetic grass which was laid to replace the natural surface in 2006. In addition to the 11-a-side markings, the pitch is also laid out with dark blue 7-a-side markings across the width of each half of the pitch.
The main stand running alongside the western edge of the pitch with a capacity of close to 2,000 spectators, standing only. There are no seats but spectators tend to seat directly onto the concrete. The stand is uncovered and consequently spectators are exposed to the elements. The changing rooms and offices underneath the stand were seriously damaged by fire, thought to have been started deliberately, in June 2010; a similar arson attack destroyed the nearby headquarters of Javea Bull Rugby Club. However the local council had already earmarked the changing rooms for a complete refurbishment and work began in August 2010.

Grotów () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Lipinki Łużyckie, within Żary County, Lubusz Voivodeship, in western Poland.
Geography.
Laid out as a typical "Waldhufendorf", Grotów lies within the historical region of Lower Silesia, close to the border with Lower Lusatia in the northwest, approximately west of Żary and south-west of Zielona Góra.
History.
The village was founded in the 13th century by German settlers in the course of the medieval "Ostsiedlung" migration. "Greiffenhayn" was first mentioned in a 1283 deed, it was acquired by the Augustine Canons Regular at Żagań in 1388. Against their resistance, it became part of the Silesian Duchy of Żagań under the Piast duke Jan I, after his father-in-law Elector Rudolf III of Saxony had devastated the settlement. The Canons Regular suppressed the Protestant Reformation, which was not introduced until the area was conquered by Prussia during the First Silesian War in 1742. A Protestant church was erected in 1830.

Nicholas Hill (scientist)

Nicholas Hill (1570-1610?) was an English natural philosopher, considered a disciple of Giordano Bruno. He is known for his 1601 book "Philosophia epicurea".
Life.
He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and St John's College, Oxford where he matriculated in 1587, graduated B.A. and became Fellow in 1590. He was removed from his fellowshop in 1591.
After a possible position as secretary or steward to Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, he was supported by Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland. He was said to be a Catholic convert, by John Aubrey, but this is doubted by Christopher Hill. Aubrey's account also has him a close friend of Robert Hues, at the centre of the Northumberland circle. He left England and resided in Rotterdam, with his son. Hugh Trevor-Roper considers that he was a Catholic, and for that reason expelled from St John's. He also associates Hill with the plot of Sir Robert Basset. According to an account of Hues recorded by Obadiah Walker, Hill's son died and he then committed suicide.
John Donne satirized Hill in his "Catalogus Librorum Aulicum"; and he was attacked and mocked by Ben Jonson (epigram 133/134).
Works.
"Philosophia epicurea, democritiana, theophrastica" was a work on the classical atomism of Epicurus and skepticism. It consisted of 509 aphorisms, which drew on Bruno and Lullism, Neoplatonism and Paracelsus, as well as classical authors. It was published in 1601 (Paris), and in another edition in 1619 (Geneva). It included thoughts on an imaginary voyage to the Moon, a theme taken from Bruno. It also shows a close relation to Bruno’s "De Immenso" and "De Minimo". Other influences were Democritus, Hermes Trismegistus and William Gilbert. He was a Copernican, perhaps also following Francesco Patrizi. Hill, however, stops short of exploring atomism as a mechanistic philosophy. Robert Kargon considers that Hill was not, in strict terms, an Epicurean, reserving to Walter Charleton the first English exposition of Epicurean thought.
The "Philosophia epicurea" was known to John Donne, through Ben Jonson's copy. It was referenced in Robert Burton's "Anatomy of Melancholy". 
According to Robert Hues, other unpublished work followed Bruno.

Galatia (Roman province)

Galatia was the name of a province of the Roman Empire in Anatolia (modern central Turkey). It was established by the first emperor, Augustus (sole rule 30 BC - 14 AD), in 25 BC, covering most of formerly independent Celtic Galatia, with its capital at Ancyra.
Under the reforms of Diocletian, its northern and southern parts were split off to form the southern part of the province of Paphlagonia and the province of Lycaonia, respectively. In ca. 398, during the reign of Arcadius, it was divided in two provinces, Galatia Prima and Galatia Secunda or Salutaris. Galatia Prima covered the northeastern part of the old province, retaining Ancyra as its capital, and was headed by a "consularis", while Salutaris comprised the southwestern half of the old province, and was headed by a "praeses" with seat at Pessinus. Both provinces were part of the Diocese of Pontus. The two provinces were briefly reunited in 536-548 under Justinian I. Although the area was eventually incorporated in the new "thema" of Anatolikon in the latter half of the 7th century, traces of the old provincial administration survived until the early 8th century.

Carl Heinrich Biber

Carl Heinrich Biber (4 September 1681 – 19 November 1749) was a late Baroque violinist and composer.
He was born in Salzburg, the sixth son of Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber. He got his first musical education from him. In 1704, he made a study trip to Venice and Rome, important centers of music. After his return, he was employed as a violinist and valet and from 1714, he was appointed "Vicekapellmeister" at the Salzburg court. In 1743, he succeeded "Hofkapellmeister" Matthias Sigismund Biechteler (1668?–1743) and he was also supervisor of Leopold Mozart. He died in his native city of Salzburg, aged 68.
He belongs to the generation of composers who represented stylistic transition between composers committed to the older, late Baroque style ideal and rococo composers. His work consists mainly of masses and other liturgical works that also include instrumental church sonatas. The latter are mostly string sonatas with organ accompaniment, seldom brass and woodwind instruments. However, the quality of Carl Heinrich's works does not reach the quality of his father's works.

Bithynia et Pontus

Bithynia et Pontus was the name of a province of the Roman empire on the Black Sea coast of Anatolia (Turkey). It was formed by the amalgamation of the former kingdoms of Bithynia (annexed by Rome 74 BC) and Pontus (annexed 63 BC).
History.
The province of "Bithynia and Pontus" was originally two separate kingdoms, among the several successor kingdoms of Alexander the Great's empire.
Roman ally.
The Kingdom of Bithynia first achieved Independence from the larger Hellenistic kingdoms in 297 BC under its first king Zipoetes I of Bithynia. Under king Prusias I, Bithynia first came into contact with the Roman Republic. Bithynia remained neutral during Rome's war against the Seleucid Empire and its King Antiochus the Great from 192-188 BC, despite the Seleucid Empire being the long-time enemy of the kingdom. 
Prusias I's son and successor, Prusias II of Bithynia, first opened relations with Rome. Following Prusias II's failed invasion of the Roman ally of the Kingdom of Pergamon in 154 BC, Bithynia was forced to pay heavy war reparations. Prusias II sent his son Nicomedes II of Bithynia to Rome to negotiate a reduction in the annual payments. Once in Rome, Nicomedes II gained the favor of the Roman Senate and, following a failed assassination attempt on Nicomedes II's life by his father Prusias II, the Senate supported Nicomedes II in his revolt against his father. Supported by Rome and Pergamon king Attalus II Philadelphus, Nicomedes II overthrew his father and became king in 149 BC and entered into an alliance with Rome. 
Nicomedes II would be a loyal ally, actively supporting Rome's interests in the Aegean Sea and Black Sea. In 133 BC, King Attalus III of Pergamon died, bequeathing his kingdom to Rome. However, Eumenes III, claiming to be the illegitimate son of a former Pergamon king, claimed the throne and made war against the Romans. Though the Romans sent the Consul Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus to enforce their claims in 130 BC, Eumenes III defeated them and killed Crassus. Rome sent a second army in 129 BC under Marcus Perperna to face Pergamon pretender. Supported by forces under Nicomedes II, Perperna was able to defeat Eumenes III and secured Rome's claims in western Anatolia, allowing Rome to annex Pergamon directly as the province of Asia.
Client kingdom.
First Mithridatic War (89–85 BC).
Relations between Bithnyia and Rome soured during the reign of Nicomedes II's son and successor Nicomedes III over the influence over the central Anatolian kingdom of Cappadocia.
Becoming king in 127 BC, Nicomedes III conqurered Paphlagonia along the Black Sea and began to expand his influence over the Roman ally of Cappadocia. In 116 BC, the Cappadocian king Ariarathes VI was murdered by the Cappadocian noble Gordius on orders from King Mithridates VI of Pontus. Mithridates VI then installed his sister Laodice of Cappadocia, Ariarathes VI's widow, as regent over for the infant Ariarathes VII, ensuring Pontic control over Cappadocia in the process. 
Nicomedes III sought to take advantage of the political power vacuum in Cappadocia, invaded the kingdom, and refused to recoginze the infant Ariarathes VII as Cappadocia's legitimate ruler. Laodice, mother of Nicomedes III's deaseced wife Nysa, then married Nicomedes III to secure his hold over the kingdom. Mithridates VI swiftly invaded Cappadocia to prevent Nicomedes III from claiming the throne, expelled Nicomedes III, restored his nephew Ariarathes VII to the Cappadocian throne, and returned Cappadocia to Pontus' sphere of influence. 
Following a rebellion in by Cappadocian nobles in 97 BC against Pontic control, both Nicomedes III and Mithridates VI sent emissaries to Rome in 95 BC asking the Republic to intervene in their struggle for dominance over the kingdom. The Roman Senate did not side with either party, however, and demanded both to withdraw from Cappadocia and ensure its independence. 
The next year, in 94 BC, Nicomedes III died and was succeeded by his son, the pro-Roman Nicomedes IV of Bithynia, as king. In 93 BC, ignoring Rome's command to not interfere with Cappadocia's independence, soldiers from the Kingdom of Armenia under Tigranes the Great, son-in-law of Mithridates VI, invaded and conquered Cappadocia at the behest of the Pontic king. With Cappadocia secured, Mithridates VI invaded Bithynia, defeating Nicomedes IV in 90 BC, annexing his kingdom. 
Nicomedes IV sought the protection of Rome. Upon arriving in Italy, the Senate sent a delegation to Pontus, demanding Mithridates restore Nicomedes IV to his throne. Though the Social War was still raging in Italy, Rome was able to successfully restore both kings due to the Republic's growing influence in the region.
Once restored to his throne, the Senate encouraged Nicomedes IV to raid Mithridates VI's territories. Mithridates VI invaded Bithynia in 88 BC, again forcing Nicomedes IV to flee to Rome. In response to the ousting of Nicomedes IV and Mithridates VI's growing power, the Senate declared war against Pontus and sent the Consul Lucius Cornelius Sulla east to defeat Mithridates VI. Rome's victory over Mithridates VI in 85 BC and the subsequent Treaty of Dardanos secured Rome as the major power in Anatolia, restored Nicomedes IV to his throne, and further brought Bithynia into closer ties with the Republic. 
From 80 BC to 78 BC, during the dictatorship of Sulla, Julius Caesar fled to Bithynia to avoid being killed in Sulla's proscription.
Third Mithridatic War (73–63 BC).
Due to the internal political struggle between Lucius Cornelius Sulla, Gaius Marius, and Lucius Cornelius Cinna, Rome had been unable to definitively defeat Pontic King Mithridates VI. In 74 BC, King Nicomedes IV of Bithynia died and, hoping to secure his kingdom from further Pontic aggression, bequeathed his kingdom to Rome. The Senate immediately voted to annex the kingdom as a province directly governed by the Republic.
Nicomedes IV's death caused a power vacuum in Asia Minor, allowing Mithridates VI to invade and conquer the leaderless kingdom. With Mithridates VI again having designs on Roman protectorates in Asia Minor, including Bithynia, Rome launched a third war against Pontus. Dispatching Consul Lucius Licinius Lucullus to Asia, Rome drove Pontus and its ally Armenia out of Asia proper, reasserted Roman dominance over Anatolia by 71 BC, and conquered the Kingdom of Pontus. 
Mithridates VI then fled to his ally the Kingdom of Armenia, which was invaded by Lucullus in 69 BC. Despite his initial successes, however, Lucullus was under able to bring the war against Pontus to a close as Mithridates VI remained at-large. Recalling Lucullus, the Senate dispatched Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey") to the East to finally defeat Mithridates VI. Arriving in Asia Minor in 65 BC, Pompey decisively defeated Mithridates VI in the Caucasus Mountains of Kingdom of Armenia. 
Returning to Anatolia proper in 64 BC, Pompey officially annexed Bithynia and the western half of Pontus (including the Greek cities along the Black Sea) into the Republic as the directly governed province of "Bithynia et Pontus". As for the eastern half of Pontus ("Lesser Armenia"), Pompey added its territory to that of the Kingdom of Galatia under the Roman client king Deiotarus as a reward for his loyalty to Rome.
Roman province.
Republican civil wars.
Bithynia and Pontus became an important player during the Roman Republican civil wars. When Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon River in 49 BC and started his civil war, many of members of the Roman Senate under the leadership of Pompey fled to the East. The Galatian client king Deiotarus, ruler of the rump state of eastern Pontus (Lesser Armenia), sided with his old patron Pompey against Caesar. However, following Pompey's defeated at the Battle of Pharsulus and subsequent death in 48 BC, Deiotarus faced execution by Caesar's forced until the Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero pled his case and secured his pardon from Caesar. Caesar subsequently named Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus as his chief lieutenant in Asia Minor while Caesar traveled to Ptolemaic Egypt. 
With the Caesar in Egypt, Pharnaces II, the Roman client king of the Bosporan Kingdom and the youngest son of Mithridates VI, seized the opportunity and conquered Colchis and Lesser Armenia. The rulers of Cappadocia and Galatia, Ariobarzanes III and Deiotarus respectively, appealed to Calvinus for protection and soon the Roman forces sought battle with Pharnaces II. They met at the Battle of Nicopolis in eastern Anatolia in 48 BC, where Pharnaces II soundly defeated the Roman army and overran much of Cappadocia, Pontus, and Bithynia. 
After defeating the Ptolemaic forces at the Battle of the Nile, Caesar left Egypt in 47 BC and travelled through Syria, Cilicia, and Cappadocia to face Pharnaces II. As Pharnaces II gained word of Caesar's approach with his veteran army, he sent envoys to seek a peace, which Caesar refused. Caesar met Pharnaces II at the Battle of Zela, decisively defeating the Pontic king and reassessing Roman dominance over Asia Minor. Upon his return to the Bosporan Kingdom, Pharnaces II was assassinated by his son-in-law Asander. In return, Caesar named Asander as the kingdom's new Roman client king. Caesar then incorporated Lesser Armenia into the Roman client kingdom of Cappadocia to serve as a buffer between Rome's interests in Asia Minor against future aggression from Eastern kingdoms. 
In 45 BC, Caesar, now dictator of Rome, appointed Quintus Marcius Crispus as governor of Bithynia and Pontus. Following Caesar's assassination on March 15, 44 BC, by the members of the Roman Senate, Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus fled from Italy and assumed command of the Republic's eastern provinces, including Bithynia and Pontus, in 43 BC. When Crispus refused to serve the assassin of his patron, Cassius had him removed from office and forced into retirement. Following the defeat of Brutus and Cassius by the Second Triumvirate at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, Triumvir Mark Antony assumed command of the Republic's eastern provinces.
The Second Triumvirate expired in 33 BC, ending Antony's legal right to govern the Eastern half of the Republic. With the Triumvirate lapsed, the struggle for dominance between Antony and Octavian intensified. As Octavian built up his support in the West, Antony drew ever closer to Egyptian Queen Cleopatra. When Octavian declared war on Egypt, Antony, supported by the Eastern provinces (including Bithynia and Pontus) went to Egypt's aid against Octavian. Octavian's victory over Antony at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC ensured Octavian's position as undisputed master of the Roman world. In 27 BC, Octavian became "Augustus": the first Roman Emperor.
Rump State.
In 39 BC, Antony stripped control of Lesser Armenia (the remnants of the former Kingdom of Pontus) from the rulership of the Cappadocian king Ariarathes X of Cappadocia and made Darius of Pontus, son of Pharnaces II of Pontus, the Roman client king of Pontus. Antony also granted to Darius the rulership of the Roman client kingdom of Cilicia. His reign lasted until his death in 37 BC, after which Antony appointed Polemon I of Pontus as client king of Cilicia and Arsaces of Pontus as client king of Lesser Armenia. 
Following Arsaces' untimely death the next year in 36 BC, Antony appointed Polemon I as client king of Pontus. Years later, in 16 BC, Polemon I, at the request of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and with the approval of Roman Emperor Augustus, married Queen Dynamis of the Bosporan Kingdom, becoming ruler of that realm in addition to Pontus and Cilicia. Polemone I would later add Colchis to his realm of client kingdoms he ruled on behalf of Rome.
Following Polemon I's death in 8 BC, he was succeeded by his stepson Tiberius Julius Aspurgus as client king of the Bosporan Kingdom and by his second wife Pythodorida of Pontus became client queen of Pontus, Cilicia, and Colchis. Pythodorida would marry then King Archelaus, the Roman client king of Cappadocia, in 8 BC, thereby joining the several eastern client kingdom under a single family. Following Archelaus' death in 14 AD and the subsequent transformation of Cappadocia into a directly governed province in 18 AD, Pythodorida lost her title as queen of Cappadocia. 
Pythodorida was succeeded by her stepson Polemon II of Pontus following her death in 38 AD. Polemon II ruled as a Roman client king over Pontus and Cilicia until the Roman Emperor Nero deposed him in 62 AD. Cilicia was then annexed into a directly governed Roman province and Pontus was re-incorporated in Cappadocia, then a directly governed Roman province.
Principate.
As part of the Constitutional Reforms of Augustus which transformed the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire all Roman provinces where divided into imperial provinces and senatorial provinces. Imperial provinces were those border provinces which required a permanent military presence to protect the Empire from invasion. As such, only the Emperor (as supreme commander of the army) had the right to appoint the governors of those provinces. 
Senatorial provinces, conversely, were centered along the Mediterranean Sea and did not possess any significant military force. Augustus allowed the Senate to appoint the governors of these provinces as it had done with all provinces under the Republican system. The province of Bithynia and Pontus, as not being a border province and lacking a size able military force, was classified by Augustus as a senatorial province. Despite this official designation, the distinction between senatorial and imperial provinces quickly began to blur, with the Emperor ultimately appointing the governors of all provinces by the 1st century AD.
The Roman writer Pliny the Younger was governor of the province in 110-3 AD. His "Epistulae" ("Letters") to emperor Trajan (ruled 98-117) are a major source on Roman provincial administration.
Dominate.
Under the administrative reforms of emperor Diocletian, Bithynia et Pontus was divided into 3 smaller provinces, "Bithynia", "Honorias" and "Paphlagonia". These belonged to the diocese of Pontica, in turn part of the Prefecture of the East.
Byzantine Empire.
Following the Muslim invasions of the 640s AD, the Byzantine Empire reorganized its provincial structure into themes. The province of Bithynia and Pontus was reorganized into the Bucellarian, Opsikion, and Optimatoi themes.

John Du Cameron was a Scottish sergeant in the French army who came back to Scotland to support Bonny Prince Charlie in The 'Forty-Five'. When the rebellion failed he took to the hills with a band of renegades and fought on until he was captured and hanged in 1753. Because of his large size he was better known by the name of Sergeant Mor. He was a brigand to those who opposed him and his victims in the counties in which he operated (Perth, Inverness and Argyle), but a folk hero to those who sympathised with the aims of the rebellion (as shown by the mention of "Sergeant Mor" in "The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond", a poem by Andrew Lang).

Dougie Young

Dougie Young was a singer and songwriter from South West Queensland. Young had a white father and a Gurnu mother.
Earlier in his life he worked as a stockman, during which he learnt the guitar and started writing songs. A riding accident later ended his working as a stockman. In 1963 or 64 Jeremy Beckett, an anthropologist made field recordings of Young, many of which were released in 1965 as an ep called "Land Where the Crow Flies Backwards" (Wattle). The title track has since been covered by Gary Shearston, Athol McCoy and Chad Morgan. He was recorded twice more, first in Walgett in 1969 and then in Sydney in 1979 (soon after a report of his death). Songs from these three recordings were released by AIATSIS in 1993 as "The Songs of Dougie Young"
Young sang "Cut A Rug", a drinking song from his troubadour days in the Wilcannia in the 50s and 60s, in both the SBS documentary and accompanying cd, .
Young's song "The Land Where the Crow Flies Backwards" was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia registry in 2013.

Ghiyasuddin Bahadur Shah

Ghiyasuddin Bahadur Shah I was the son and successor of Sultan Shamsuddin Firoz Shah of the Bengal kingdom of Lakhnauti. He ruled the kingdom as an independent ruler during 1322-1324 CE and as a governor during 1324-1328 CE.
History.
Ghiyasuddin Bahadur Shah issued coins when his father was still living. On the death of his father he ascended the throne in 1322. Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq, Sultan of Delhi, declared war against him in 1324. After losing the battle, Bahadur Shah was captured and taken to Delhi as a prisoner. Bengal was thus turned into a province of the Delhi Sultanate. 
In the same year, Delhi Sultan Muhammad bin Tughlaq, son and successor of Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq, released him and appointed him to govern Sonargaon as a province. Bahadur Shah founded a new city, Ghiyaspur, at a site 24 Kilometre southwest of present-day Mymensingh.
He asserted independence in 1328. Sultan Muhammad bin Tughlaq sent his general, Bahram Khan, to depose him. In the battle, Bahadur Shah was defeated and killed. Bahram Khan recaptured Sonargaon for the Delhi Sultanate and he became the governor of Sonargaon.

John Nicol

John Nicol (1755-1825) was a Scottish sailor who in 1789 sailed on the "Lady Juliana", a convict ship which transported women to Port Jackson in New South Wales, Australia. His autobiography, published in 1822, offers a rare first-hand account of the life of an ordinary Georgian sailor.
Life.
Nicol was born at Currie, near Edinburgh, in Scotland. His father was a cooper, and his mother died in childbirth while Nicol was young. He was apprenticed to a cooper, and in 1776 joined the Royal Navy, serving first on HMS "Proteus" in the North Atlantic. He then served on HMS "Surprise", before being discharged at the conclusion of the American War of Independence in 1783.
In the next few years Nicol sailed in a whaling ship in the waters off Greenland, and sailed to the West Indies and China. He also circumnavigated the globe during this period, doing so twice during is lifetime.
In 1789 he left England on the "Lady Juliana", which was transporting over 200 female convicts to Australia. It was common practice for crew-members to take a 'wife' from the convicts – Nicol's wife, a convicted shoplifter from Lincoln named Sarah Whitlam, bore him a son during the voyage. They were separated on their arrival at Port Jackson in 1790, and Nicol never saw either again. The day after Nicol's departure, Whitelam married another man.
In 1794 Nicol was impressed into the Royal Navy, and subsequently fought at the battles of Cape St Vincent and the Nile on HMS "Goliath".
After being discharged following the Peace of Amiens, he returned to Scotland, married his cousin, and resumed work as a carpenter. With the resumption of the Napoleonic Wars, Nicol lived in constant fear of being impressed, and thus left Edinburgh for rural Scotland. Eventually he grew too old to be at risk of impressment, and so travelled to London in search of his naval pension, which he was unable to obtain. He returned to Scotland, where he was so poor that he had to pick scraps of coal from the street in order to keep himself warm.
In 1822, Nicol was approached by John Howell, a 'polyartist' whose numerous inventions included a device for trimming the leaves of books, in addition to a flying machine and prototype submarine. Howell published five books which detailed the lives of former soldiers or sailors. His method seems to have involved befriending impoverished men and then noting down their stories; all royalties from publication were assigned to the subjects themselves.

Ludwig Buchhorn

Karl Ludwig Bernhard Christian Buchhorn (18 April 1770 in Halberstadt - 13 November 1856 in Berlin) was a German painter and engraver.
Life.
Between 1790 and 1793 Buchhorn was at the Academy of the Arts, Berlin. In addition to aquatint and lithography, Buchhorn adopted from his teachers a Crayon style.
In 1797 he got a job as a draftsman and engraver in Dessau, where he worked until 1803. He then worked for a time as a freelance artist.
In 1806 Buchhorn settled in Berlin and worked again with the Academy. He took over as the Kakademie " Ordinary Member" in 1811, where he served three years later as a lecturer in drawing and engraving. In the same year Buchhorn founded with some colleagues the "Berlinische Artists' Association."
After the death of his teacher Daniel Berger, Buchhorn was entrusted in 1824 with the leadership of the Academic engraving school. While teaching he had many disciples, among them were Friedrich Eduard Eichens, Rudolf Hertzberg, Hermann Kramer Edward Almond, Adolf Schrödter. At the age of 86 years he died on November 13, 1856 in Berlin.
In his early works, the Old Master was a big focus of his work. Influenced by Franz Krüger and Johann Gottfried Schadow, Buchhorn soon found a unique style and worked in his later works increasingly from nature. Portraits of Buchhorn were painted by Johann Carl Kretzschmar and Georg Friedrich Adolph Schöner.

Louis Pierre Henriquel-Dupont

Louis Pierre Henriquel-Dupont (Paris 13 June 1797 – 20 January 1892 Paris) was a French engraver. His students included Charles Bellay, Jean-Baptiste Danguin, Adrien Didier, Alphonse and Jules François, Adolphe-Joseph Huot, Achille and Jules Jaquet, Jules Gabriel Levasseur, Aristide Louis, Louis Marckl, Isidore-Joseph Rousseaux and Charles Albert Waltner.
Life.
Between the ages of 14 and 17, he studied painting in the studio of Pierre-Narcisse Guérin at the École des beaux-arts in Paris. He then devoted himself for four years to an apprenticeship in engraving under Charles Clément Balvay, nicknamed "the last of the fine burinists", who made him copy the great masters. Between 1816 and 1818, Henriquel lost out on the first prize for engraving twice, which determined him to set up his own studio and follow new styles. Under the influence of English engravers and of Girard Audran, he tended towards "a live, witty and clear line". In 1831 his engraving after Louis Hersent's "Abdication of Gustavus Vasa" established his reputation and won him the légion d'honneur. He then worked for six years on his masterwork, an engraving of Paul Delaroche's "Hemicycle of the fine arts" - this engraving won an honorary medal at the 1853 Paris Salon. In 1849 he was elected a member of the Académie des beaux-arts. He became a professor at the École des beaux-arts in 1863 and founded the Société française de la gravure in 1868. In 1871 he was made president of the Académie des beaux-arts and was still engraving aged 85.
Works.
Working not only with the burin but also in the varied fields of lithography, etching and aquatint. His other originality is in having engraved many paintings by his contemporaries : Paul Delaroche, Ary Scheffer, Dominique Ingres, Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury, Antoine-Jean Gros, François Gérard ; it was only towards the end of his life that he dealt with the old masters such as Veronese, Corregio or Caravaggio. As an illustrator, he notably engraved works by Alexandre-Joseph Desenne's and Achille Devéria's vignettes for the "Fables" by La Fontaine and for "La Pucelle d'Orléans" by Voltaire, though it is his portraits for which he is most noted:
Hemicycle.

Two artists, Théophile Gautier and Charles Blanc, have compared Delaroche's work to that of Henriquel, both preferring the engraver to the painter : 
Bertin portrait.
One of Henriquel-Dupont's most famous portraits is that of the journalist Louis-François Bertin, engraved in burin after the portrait by Ingres. When they were both shown at the 1845 Paris Salon, Baudelaire preferred the painting to the engraving :

BB Gandanghari

BB Gandanghari (English: "Miss Beautiful King", born Rustom Cariño Padilla on May 15, 1967) is a Filipina transsexual actress and commercial model. She is the elder sister to actor Robin Padilla and younger sister to Royette and Rommel Padilla, both actors. In January 2009, after returning from the United States, Gandanghari came out as a trans woman and changed her name to BB (sometimes spelled Bebe Gandanghari), saying that the person which the people used to know is already dead. 
In an interview, Gandanghari stated the name is derived from the Filipino words Bb. (abbreviation of "Binibining", an honorific equivalent to "Miss") and Gandanghari, a portmanteau of the words "ganda" (beauty) and "hari" (king), adding that the "Bb." refers to her motto "'Be' all that you can 'be'".
Background.
Gandanghari entered show business as a matinee idol and later as an action star. She was also the presenter of Philippine franchise for "Wheel of Fortune" on ABC 5. After her hosting stint, Gandanghari left the Philippines and studied filmmaking in the United States.

Revolution (cycling series) – Season 5

Season 5 (2007/2008).
The first Revolution event of the season was held in October 2007 with a brand new track surface, replaced over the summer after wearing out 17 years early because of heavy use. This season was going to be a vital one for the preparation of the British team. The series built up to the 2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Manchester in March, followed by the Olympic Games in August. Competition for places in the successful squad was fierce, with performances at the Revolution events an important factor in the selection process. At the final event of the season, trials even took place to see who would be the lead off man for Team sprint squad. Jamie Staff performed best on the night and went on to take the place in the squad at the expense of Craig MacLean.
Sprint competition.
At the season opening Revolution 17 event top British riders Craig MacLean and Jamie Staff took on international visitors Itmar Estoban and Michael Blanchford. Also in the competition were younger British riders led by the rising star Jason Kenny. Maclean reached the final and came up against Kenny, in what proved to be a significant encounter. Kenny took the victory, a result which would signal the start of a changing of the guard in the sprint squad. In the Keirin race Staff took the victory, pipping Kenny on the line.
Revolution 18 saw a junior sprint competition take place. In the Women's Omnium event, Great Britain took on a German team including Junior World Sprint Champion Kristina Vogel. The British team of Jess Varnish, Becky James and Laura Trott took overall. In the Men's competition the French and Germans provided the opposition. Peter Mitchell came up against Frenchman Charlie Conord in the final, with Conord powering to victory. The evening was rounded off with a Team Sprint event. The British development team were defeated by the Germans, while the main British team were narrowly beaten by the French.
An omnium sprint competition took place at Revolution 19, with reigning World Champion Theo Bos going up against the top British riders. The evening saw a truly dominant performance from Jason Kenny. The opening event saw Kenny set a new personal best time of 10.178 in the 200 Metre Time Trial, defeating World Champion and record holder Bos. He then went on to defeat all comers in the rounds of the sprint omnium. The only race Kenny did not win was the Keirin race at the end of the evening, which was won by Bos to savage some pride from the evening.
In the final event of the season, Revolution 20, Chris Hoy defeated his team mates and the French sprint squad to take victory in the Keirin. In the main sprint competition Ross Edgar defeated Jamie Staff in the final to take the victory. Elsewhere Victoria Pendleton took victory in the Women's competition.
Endurance competition.
Competition was also strong in the endurance ranks. Established stars and Revolution regulars like Chris Newton, Mark Cavendish and Rob Hayles faced stiff competition from their young team mates and a host of international stars.
At the opening Revolution 17 event, the season got under way with a motor paced scratch race. Mark Cavendish make a move on the last lap to come around the outside of the field and take victory on the line from Geriant Thomas. In the Points Race a group of seven riders broke clear including Newton, Cavendish, Clancy and American Colby Pearce. The group gained a lap on the field, with the race coming down to a sprint between the seven. Peace was able to hit the line first, followed home be Clancy and Newton. The feature scratch race was a fantic affair, with four rider breaking away from the field. The smooth team work of Newton, David O'Loughlin, Mike Friedman and Magnus Bäckstedt allowed them to gain a lap on the field. The rest of the field were then withdrawn in the closing laps to allow the four to sprint it out for victory alone. Newton made no mistake and lead from the front to take a clear victory.
Revolution 18 saw a strong field of riders, including Bradley Wiggins, Franco Marvulli and World Points Race Champion Joan Llaneras. Marvulli took the opening Motor Paced Scratch race, with Wiggins taking second place. Next up was the Scratch Race, which saw a break away gaining a lap featuring Wiggins, Llanearas, Newton and Ben Swift. Wiggins looked set to take victory in the sprint but just failed to get around young Swift who took the victory. The young British riders form continued as Peter Kennauagh, Johnny Bellis and Andy Tennant defeated their senior Spanish opponents in a Team Pursuit Chaallenge. A feature length Points Race rounded off the evening, with much expected of the big names in the field. However the likes of Wiggins and Llanearas and Marvulli did not have it their own way as they were not involved in the various break aways that took place. In the end Newton continued his resurrenge of form in the Points Race by taking victory from O'Loughlin and Toni Tauler.
Mark Cavendish returned at Revolution 19 to continue his build up to a busy road and track season in 2008. He made an early break for home in Motor Pace Scratch Race, however he could not hold off the charging Newton who took victory from Steven Burke. The Points Race was contested at the front by youngsters Kennaugh, Swift and Burke. Swift held the lead going until the final stages, until threatened by a late break by Kennaugh to take the final sprint. However Swift came home in fourth in the sprint to take the victory by one point. This trio then also dominated the closing stages of the Scratch race, freezing out the big guns like Newton. Burke took a close finish on the line to add to his National Scratch Race Title.
In the season finale it was an all team affair, with all the events competed in Madison pairings. The duo of Rob Hayles and Geraint Thomas took victory in the Elimination Scratch race. A unique team Points race also took place, with each rider of the duo competing half of the race before changing over with his team mate. Iljo Keisse and Dimitri DeFauw took victory in this fast paced event. In the feature Madison race the duos of Peter Schep and Jens Mouris and Great Britain's Rob Hayles and Geraint Thomas gained a lap and fought it out for the victory. Schrep finished ahead of Hayles in the final sprint to take the victory.
In the Madison Time Trial event, early season victories went to the teams of Mark Cavendish and Ed Clancy and Ben Swift and Jonathan Bellis. At Revolution 19 the duo of Steven Burke and Peter Kennaugh took the top spot. The competition at Revolution 20 was eagerly awaited as current record co-holder Arnaud Tournant was to team up with the legendary Chris Hoy to attempt to beat the record. News of Tournant's shoulder injury, making a proper hand sling changeover impossible, put their record attempt in doubt. However the crowd were on their feat as the duo set a new record with an awesome time of 54.5 seconds, which still stands today.
Future Stars series.
In the boys competition the stand out performer was Dan McLay, who finished some distance ahead of nearest rival Chris Whorral. In the girls competition it was closer at the top with Corinne Hall taking victory in the end over Hannah Manley.

Battle of Oltenița

The Battle of Oltenița (or Oltenitza) was fought on 4 November 1853 and was the first engagement of the Crimean War. In this battle an Ottoman army under the command of Omar Pasha defeated the Russian forces led by General P. A. Dannenberg.
Background.
This battle took place during the Danube campaign of the Crimean War. In the build-up to war, Russia had occupied the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia, positioning troops on the (northern) left bank of the Danube, the border of Ottoman territory. The Ottoman Empire had responded by moving troops to the right bank to face them.
In the centre Russian forces south of Bucharest were faced by Ottoman forces in the fortresses of Rustchuk and Silistria.
Following the Ottoman ultimatum on 4 October 1853 to withdraw within 2 weeks, Ottoman forces under Omer Pasha crossed the Danube River from Widin into Kalafat on 28 October 1853 to draw the Russians into the western part of Wallachia.
Action.
On 2 November 1853 an Ottoman force of 10,000 troops under Omer Pasha crossed the Danube in eastern Wallachia and occupied the Danube port town of Oltenița, prior to an advance on Bucharest. With the Russians now in western Wallachia fighting the Ottomans at Calafat, the capture of Bucharest would cut off all communications and supply between Russia and those troops. Having captured Oltenița the Ottoman troops moved up the north bank of the Danube to attack the large fort located in the town of Turtukai. This fort was protected by ten (10) large guns. This fort was captured by the Ottomans.
In response, a Russian force under PA Dannenburg was sent to counterattack, arriving at the town on 4 November 1853. The heavy guns at the fort in Turtukai were used by the Ottomans against the Russians and after a fierce exchange of fire the Russians were thrown back, with heavy casualties. Despite this success, however, the action persuaded Omer that his position was untenable; he expected Russian reinforcements to arrive, and was concerned about continuing operations with the onset of winter. Accordingly he abandoned the advance on Bucharest and re-crossed the Danube. This was completed by 15 November 1853.
Aftermath.
The battle of Oltenitza was the first military engagement of the Crimean War. It resulted in a tactical victory for the Ottoman forces, in that the Russians were driven off, and the Ottoman forces were left in possession of the town.
Nevertheless their strategic aim, to advance on Bucharest and drive the Russians from the Principalities, was not accomplished, and the Ottoman forces were obliged to retreat to their start position.
The battle was hailed in the European press as an Ottoman triumph, and Russian pride was damaged, but strategically the action had little impact.

William Henry Temple Gairdner

William Henry Temple Gairdner (July 31, 1873 – May 22, 1928) was a British Christian missionary with the Church Missionary Society in Cairo, Egypt. His entire life was dedicated to service in Egypt as he himself commented when he was first preparing to leave. While in Cairo he partnered with his dear friend Douglas M. Thornton in order to reach educated Muslims with the gospel of Jesus Christ. This dynamic duo held many lectures in their home, Beit Arabi Pasha, and wrote a weekly magazine titled "Orient and Occident". After Thornton's death in 1907 Gairdner continued his work in Cairo but was never able to recapture the amount of work that was accomplished when Thornton was at his side. It was this lack of help that would plague his ministry until the day of his death in 1928. Gairdner was a prolific writer and scholar of Arabic. He showed much promise to contribute greatly in theological and scholarly circles of Islam but instead chose to serve the local church in Cairo.
Family and early life.
Gairdner was born in Ardrossan, Ayrshire, Scotland on July 31, 1873. He was the son of Sir William Tennant Gairdner, a Scotsman, and Helen Bridget Wright, an English-woman. Gairdner was educated at St Ninian's Prep School, Moffat and Rossall School. His father served as a professor of medicine at Glasgow University and bestowed upon young Gairdner his passions for music, science, and philosophy. His mother contributed to Gairdner's experiences in school life and church life as she often conveyed her love for the Anglican Church to him as well as arranged for his traditional English education. Also Gairdner's personality drew greatly from his mother. From her he drew his sense of humor and emotional nature.
Gairdner married Margaret Mitchell in October 1902 at Christ Church, Nazareth. Margaret was one of Gairdner's childhood friends and was the daughter of Dr. J. O. Mitchell. Gairdner and Margaret celebrated twenty-five years of marriage and raised five children together before Gairdner's death in 1928.
Oxford University.
Gairdner entered Trinity College, Oxford in October 1892. Gairdner’s educational career at Oxford is marked by his involvement in the Oxford Inter-Collegiate Christian Union (OICCU). Gairdner remained on the fringe of this group until March 1893 “Where he experienced the overwhelming ‘embrace of Christ’, and responded in faith.” It was at the Congress of Unions at Oxford that brought Gairdner to this point and pushed him into a new passion for service and witness. Gairdner finished his time at Oxford in 1897 but that would not be the last time he would spend in diligent study.
In 1910 after serving eleven years with the Church Missionary Society in Cairo, Egypt, Gairdner was granted a one year leave of absence in order to study Arabic and Islam. Gairdner was gone for a total of eighteen months leaving at the end of May 1910 and returning to Cairo in November 1911. Gairdner made three major stops on this educational leave, the first being in Potsdam, Germany in order to study the German language and be able to read German literature of which there were many writings on Islamic topics. The next five months were spent at Hartford Theological Seminary in Hartford, Connecticut where he was able to study with Duncan Black MacDonald who was one of the foremost Western scholars of Islam. The last portion of his study year was used to return to Europe where he studied with the Hungarian scholar of Islam, Ignaz Goldziher, and toured different institutions in order to study methods of missionary training.
Career.
After finishing his schooling at Oxford, Gairdner became a traveling secretary for the Student Christian Movement until 1899. At this point Gairdner was ordained and the Church Missionary Society (CMS) sent him to Cairo with his beloved friend, Douglas Thornton. Gairdner’s role in Cairo was to work with educated Muslims and so Gairdner and Thornton opened their home, called Beit Arabi Pasha, in order to conduct meetings and lead study groups with Muslims of higher education. 
In January 1905, Thornton and Gairdner were able to release the first issue of their Anglo-Arabic magazine, "Orient and Occident". This magazine was created to present articles of general interest and to reach a wider audience than Thornton and Gairdner were already reaching. Many of the articles dealt with questions and objections that Muslims would raise about Christianity such as the authenticity of the Bible. 
Thornton’s death in 1907 was a large blow to Gairdner and tested him severely. However the loss of his dear friend did not hinder him in his ministry. He continued with his work, especially that of the "Orient and Occident" and even undertook several other writing jobs. This workload put a halt to the meetings at Beit Arabi Pasha a year after Thornton’s death but Gairdner was able to finish two books by 1909, "D. M. Thornton: a study of missionary ideals and methods" and "The Reproach of Islam".
Upon his return to Cairo after his year of absence to study Arabic and Islam, Gairdner found himself in a much different role than he had before. Gairdner was put to a much more technical aspect of the mission. His role now included much more grammatical work in Arabic as well as being the Mission secretary. This role was not his forte and he found great difficulty in dealing with the administration tasks and transactions of an organization.
After Gairdner’s time as Mission secretary he began experimenting in the medium in which the gospel could be shared. Between 1921 and 1925 Gairdner began to take biblical narratives and presenting them in dramas. This was eventually shut down by the CMS who instead advocated for the establishment of an Arabic Anglican Church. Gairdner took great delight in this church and saw that it’s growth was much more important than his own production of literature. 
Some of his last endeavours before his death in 1928 include his speaking on "Brotherhood, Islam’s or Christ’s" at a Scottish Missionary Conference in 1922 as well as the composition of several literary works. These works include Arabic-language commentaries on Galatians, Hebrews, and Philippians and "The Values of Christianity and Islam".

Charles Clément Balvay (23 May 1756, Paris - 23 March 1822, Paris), known as Bervic, was a French engraver mainly working in intaglio and exclusively in burin. Due to an error in transcribing the baptismal register, he is also now known as Jean Guillaume Balvay.
He served his first apprenticeship under Jean-Baptiste Le Prince, then left aged 14 for the studio of the engraver Jean-Georges Wille. Aged 18 he won first prize for drawing at the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture, of which he was elected a member in 1784. He became a member of the Académie des beaux-arts in 1803.

Robert Cock

Robert Cock (25 May 1801 to 23 March 1871) was one of the first European explorers of the Adelaide region of South Australia following the establishment of the new colony in December 1836. 
Robert was born in Dysart, Fife, Scotland in 1801, and arrived in South Australia with his family aboard the "HMS Buffalo" in December 1836, thus being in the first group of settlers in the new colony. Robert actively set about setting up his business affairs in the new colony. "He set up a sort of thatched roof in which he and his wife and 6 children lived while he built a house. The house, when built, was used as a store and saleroom, and the family remained in the primitive shelter whilst he pursued his explorations". He was appointed SA's first government auctioneer in early 1837, a position he held until November 1838.
In addition to his auction rooms, Robert became a land agent, and conducted explorations of the areas around Adelaide, and the Yorke and Eyre peninsulas.
In December 1837, Robert led a party of William Finlayson, A. Wyatt and G. Barton to explore the country between Adelaide and Lake Alexandrina. Leaving Adelaide on 25 December, they became the first Europeans to climb Mount Barker (although there is a more plausible counter-claim by Sir John Morphett). They crossed and named the Hindmarsh and the Angas rivers, arriving at Lake Alexandrina on 31 December. (The Hindmarsh was subsequently renamed the Bremer). In his journal, Robert noted the suitability of the region for wine growing. (He is occasionally cited as being the first to identify the Adelaide Hills as suitable for wine growing e.g. Pike). There is a memorial cairn to the explorers in Bridgewater, near the Bridgewater Mill site. Coxs Creek (originally Cock's Creek) was named after Robert Cock.
In June 1838, Robert discovered a carriage route through the Adelaide Hills, which opened up communication between Adelaide and the Mt Barker region.
In August 1838, Robert Cock along with Edward Eyre and Bewes Strangways travelled back to Mount Barker to meet the celebrated explorer Charles Sturt, who had driven stock from New South Wales to Adelaide
In December 1838, Robert and the surgeon, R. G. Jameson, conducted a survey of the east coast of Yorke Peninsula. They concluded “if we could have found a fresh water river, we would have found it a good country for the maintenance of flocks and herds. From the numerous native population it is obvious that there is no scarcity of fresh water, although we could not find it.”
In May 1839, Robert explored the Port Vincent area in conjunction with James Hughes.
In June 1839, Robert led a party on the schooner “Victoria”, captained by Captain Hutchinson. They explored Spencer Gulf, following the western shores of the Yorke Peninsula and the coast of the Eyre Peninsula as far as Port Lincoln. “Water can be had at from ten to twenty feet from the surface. In all probability the peninsula will in time be a great agricultural district.”
Robert also demonstrated concern for the welfare of the aboriginal population: "... Robert Cock was deeply disturbed to find that local authorities still had no intention of honouring a commitment made while still in Britain to set aside one fifth of all land to provide a fund for aboriginal welfare. Having bought land in Adelaide he felt morally obliged to pay interest on one-fifth of the purchase price. 'I felt it my duty', he informed the local Protector of Aboriginies in 1838, 'to pay to the proper authorities for the use of the natives this yearly rent'. He denied that the money was a donation but 'a just claim that the natives of this district have on me as an occupier of those lands'."
On another occasion he intervened in a dispute between the aborigines and the settlers to prevent violence, reminding the settlers that the law was for protection of all.
After several years as a land agent, Robert took up farming, first at Balhannah in the Adelaide hills and later in Mount Gambier, where he was one of the original residents. Later on, he opened up a brewery in Mount Gambier.
Robert died in Mount Gambier in 1871, where he is buried in the Pioneers cemetery.

Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen

Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen is a two volume work describing the flora of Australia. The author was the French botanist Jacques Labillardière, who visited the region in 1792 with the d'Entrecasteaux expedition. Published between 1804 and 1806, it is one of the earliest works to describe the plants of the continent; according to Denis and Maisie Carr, "n practical terms, this was the first general flora of Australia."
The work describes the botanical collections made by himself and his companion on the d'Entrecasteaux expedition, Charles Riche, and the unattributed and later collections of Nicolas Baudin's expedition. Labillardière's collections were seized by the English, but were returned to him in France at the intervention of Joseph Banks. He made his collections at Observatory Island and other locations at the Archipelago of the Recherche. Extensive collection were also made at Recherche Bay, during his two visits to Tasmania.
The preface describes the journey "from Cape of Good Hope to Australia", an example of the continent being named as 'Australia' before its popularisation by Flinders' use in "A Voyage to Terra Australis". The work includes 256 black-and-white botanical illustrations, including contributions by Pierre-Joseph Redouté. Copper plates drawn by Pierre Antoine Poiteau and engraved by Auguste Plée were produced for other illustrations.
Labillardière had named and described more Australian flora than any other botanist of the day; the work was the most comprehensive until Robert Brown published his "Prodromus". This work featured the first descriptions of "Cephalotus follicularis", a carnivorous plant, and species "Adenanthos obovatus" and "Gahnia trifida" from the southern coast. The collections made at southwest Australia also produced new genera "Adenanthos" (Proteaceae) and "Calytrix" (Myrtaceae), species "Astartea fascicularis", "Hakea clavata" and "Taxandria marginata", and the first description of the now widely introduced "Acacia saligna". Tasmanian species include "Eucryphia lucida" (leatherwood) and "Phyllocladus aspleniifolius" (celery-top pine). The first confirmed collection of Australian bryophytes are described and illustrated by the author; the current name for these species are the mosses "Cyathophorum bulbosum" and "Hypnodendron comosum" and a liverwort "Hymenophyton flabellatum".
"Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen" has been praised for the accuracy of its descriptions and for the elegant scientific names coined therein. It has been criticised for its imprecision and occasional errors in collection locality and habitat; for example it attributes the collection of "Eucalyptus ovata" to southwest Australia, but it occurs only in Tasmania and southeast Australia. Labillardière has also been criticised for publishing species based upon specimens collected by other botanists, without providing attribution or acknowledgement for the specimens.
The standard abbreviation for the work, Nov. Holl. Pl., is used in botanical literature, and is also known by the title "Specimens of the Plants of New Holland". It is the second publication by Labillardière to describe Australian flora; the first was "Relation du Voyage à la Recherche de la Pérouse" in 1799, a popular account of the voyage in search of the La Pérouse expedition. The earlier work contains the first description of plant species such as "Eucalyptus cornuta".

History of Port Vale F.C.

The history of Port Vale F.C., an English association football club based in Stoke-on-Trent, began with the formation of the club, which was probably in 1879. In 1884, the club moved to the town of Burslem, changing their name to Burslem Port Vale in the process. The club joined the Football League Second Division upon its formation in 1892. In 1907, the club's name was reverted to Port Vale Football Club when the club moved to The Old Recreation Ground in Hanley. The club then moved in 1950 to Vale Park, an all-seater stadium located in Burslem with a capacity of over 20,000; the old stadium was demolished later that year.
Probably the club's greatest achievement, other than surviving over 130 years, including times of great financial hardship and expulsion from the league, is the FA Cup run of 1953–54 where they reached the semi–finals. The club have twice come close to the highest tier of English football; in 1930–31 they finished fifth and in 1996–97 they came eighth.
1876 or 1879?
The precise details of the club's founding are not known. A Port Vale cricket club were in existence in 1874, which may or may not have had any relation to the football club. The most-widely accepted story is that Port Vale were formed during an 1876 meeting at Port Vale House, from where the club was supposed to have taken its name.
However, comprehensive research by historian Jeff Kent indicated that the club was probably formed in 1879 as an offshoot of Porthill Victoria football club and took its name from its location, in the valley of canal ports. Evidence in support of this came from Vale chairman Robert Audley writing that the club was "an organisation of twenty–eight years standing" in 1907. Also John Hood and an 'E.Hood' were recorded as having scored goals for Porthill Victoria on 4 January 1879, which seems to have disbanded at the end of that season. The 1879 theory suggests that Porthill Victoria players broke away to found Port Vale in 1879, having tired of travelling up the hill to Wolstanton from their work places to play their football. Before 1926, the occasional mentions in print of the club's founding had given the year of formation as 1879, and most of the original founders would not have reached adulthood by 1876. However the January 1926, 50-year jubilee celebrations saw the 1876 date apparently firmly established as the year of the club's founding; it is not known what convinced the organizers at the time that the date was correct. To add to the confusion, local newspaper "The Sentinel" also printed 1879 as the club's founding date on 10 March 1928 and 24 August 1931, despite reporting on the jubilee celebrations in January 1926.
Another theory on the club's origins is that Port Vale was formed from a merger of Wolstanton, Middleport and Burslem St. Paul's, but there is little evidence to support it. A further theory is that Port Vale were originally a brickworks team, mainly based on the existence of bricks with "Burslem Port Vale" and "Port Vale" marked upon them. However, these names appear to be indicative of their place of manufacture (in Port Vale, the valley of ports) and often have a company name upon them, so there is no hard evidence to link them to the football club.
The unique name of Port Vale has attracted interest and debate. The players lived near such places as: Port Vale Wharf, Port Vale Street, Port Vale Corn Mills and Port Vale House. Also, with nearby Porthill Victoria having played upon a hill, the team of the valley below meant that the name Port Vale was "a rather natural choice." Another theory was that the name came from a shortening of 'Longport Vale'.
1879–1907: Early years.
The club played their football at Limekiln Lane, Longport and from 1880 at Westport, paying £1 for the use of Westport Meadows. The 1851 Ordnance Survey Map of Longport clearly shows the Port Vale Wharf and the adjacent Longport Lime Kilns, including the eponymous lane. Under its founder Enoch Hood, the club rose rapidly above the dozen or so other local Burslem clubs to become the strongest club in the town within a few years. Already in 1880 the club had a Reserve side and managed to attract the best players from their local rivals. They began to charge admission to their games and joined the Staffordshire Football Association on 6 September 1882.
The first recorded line–up was on 9 December 1882 in a Staffordshire Senior Cup second round replay at Stoke, the match finished 5–1 to Stoke, Enoch Hood scoring Vale's goal.
On 2 February 1884, the club annihilated Middlewich 16–0 in a friendly. Later in the month Billy Poulson and Charlie Simpson were selected to represent Staffordshire. The Sentinel wrote of "our two local champions – Stoke and Port Vale". From that point on it was these two clubs that defined football in the Potteries.
The club moved to Burslem in 1884, they played at a new ground constructed at Moorland Road. The first game at the ground was a 6–0 thrashing of Everton. Not long after the club changed its name to Burslem Port Vale. In the summer of 1885, the club moved into the Athletic Ground and started to pay their players regular wages.
In 1888, the club failed to gain inclusion for the founding of the Football League, rivals Stoke were one of the twelve founders. Vale instead joined The Second Combination, a league which lasted just the one season. Their poor showing in that league meant they were not invited to join the new and short–lived Football Alliance. Progress was made however, as the club hired their first professional trainer – Joey Law, from West Bromwich Albion.
In 1890 the club became founder members of the Midland Football League, where they played two seasons of football. A third place finish in 1891–92 was enough to win them election to the new Football League Second Division in 1892. The club suffered greatly from the death of star striker Frank McGinnes. On 10 December 1892, they played in a snowstorm, and lost 10–0 at home to Sheffield United. This remains a Football League record. Vale finished eleventh out of twelve, but won re–election to the league.
The team fared poorly in the league for the following three seasons and failed to win re–election at the end of 1895–96. This resulted in another two seasons in the Midland League. They fared poorly, but as the Football League expanded for the 1898–99 season, Port Vale were re–elected – this came mostly thanks to their FA Cup victory over eventual First Division champions Sheffield United.
The club's financial troubles were not solved by their league status, they suffered indifference in the league the cup competitions for several seasons. Adrian Capes was top scorer for four consecutive seasons and was a rare bright light. The club survived by selling their top players (including Copes), going on cup runs and cutting costs wherever possible.
The club resigned from the league on 14 June 1907. An appeal for supporters to prop the club up with donations failed, the directors did not believe the club to viable "in any shape or form". Stoke and Oldham Athletic took on most of the now unemployed players.
1907–1919: Years in the wilderness.
Burslem Port Vale were awaiting liquidation and were no longer in operation, eventually being wound up in 1909. The club's history would have ended at this point, had it not been for an unexpected twist. North Staffordshire Church League champions Cobridge Church were accepted into the North Staffordshire Federation League, still a very minor league. Joint–secretaries Millward and E.C.Brundrett had very big ambitions however. They sought permission from the Football Association to change the club's name to Port Vale and bought the old club's ground (the Athletic Ground). To signify their roots they renamed their reserve side to Cobridge Church.
Port Vale were now playing teams such as Leek United, Newchapel United and Ashwood Villa. However their fifth placed finish encouraged the club to apply, successfully, for membership of the North Staffordshire & District League. Financial pressures soon affected the lowly club, and in December 1908, former Vale player Sam Bennion led a buy–out consortium. Former players Adrian Copes, Bert Eardley and Harry Croxton were re–signed and the future looked bright.
In 1909–10 the club won the North Staffordshire & District League, but lost key players such as Joe Brough (to Liverpool), Billy Cavenor (to Blackpool) and Bert Eardley (to Glossop). On 21 July 1911, the club re–organised, with J.H.Edwards elected chairman. The club also stepped up to the Central League.
Facing another financial crisis, coupled with numerous issues with their Cobridge Ground, Vale transferred to The Old Recreation Ground in 1912, moving from Burslem to Hanley. This allowed the club to regular host over 10,000 spectators.
At the end of the 1913–14 season, Vale agreed to stand down for re–election to the Football League, so that their stronger rivals Stoke would have a stronger chance of gaining re–election. It was understood that this favour would one day be repaid. In the meantime, former Stoke veteran and former England international Tom Holford was appointed as player-manager.
The club ceased activities in 1914–15, in order not to hinder the war effort. During the war Frank Cannon was killed and Alf Smith was seriously wounded.
In March 1919 the club failed to win re–election. However they returned to the Football League in October 1919, taking over the fixture list of Leeds City in the Second Division, who were disbanded because of financial irregularities.
1919–1929: Back with the big boys.
The club became to take their familiar shape during this period. Around November 1920, club chairman Frank Huntbach came up with the nickname of "the Valiants". In 1921 the club adopted their familiar white and black strip after having experimented with numerous colours, including; plain red, gold and black stripes, claret and blue and even during 1898–1902 playing in the red and white stripes now used by rivals Stoke City for the past 100 years. However, the kit soon changed to plain red shirts with white shorts in 1923, a look which lasted until 1934, where the white shirt, black shorts and socks kit once again was adopted.
In February 1921, top striker Bobby Blood was sold to West Bromwich Albion for an unprecedented £4,000. A January 1922 signing of Welsh international goalkeeper Teddy Peers from Wolverhampton Wanderers meant the club now saw one of its current players capped at international level for the first time. However the club were soon in financial troubles again.
In June 1923, former trainer Billy Barr reported the club to the FA for making illegal payments to its players. Found guilty, the club were punished by a £100 fine, with around £150 in total being fined to various officials and players. On 11 November 1923, Tom Butler died in hospital after sustaining injuries on the pitch. The cash–strapped club arranged a benefit fund; Stoke and numerous other clubs raised a total of £700 for the man's widow.
Wilf Kirkham was the club's top scorer in 1924–25 with 33 goals. He would be the club's top scorer for the next three seasons.
On 16 April 1926, the club's directors agreed in principle to an amalgamation with rival's Stoke City. Citing reducing gates and a history of financial trouble, the club's hierarchy felt the merger was for the best. However Vale's supporters were far from keen on the proposal and threatened to start their own club if the merger went ahead. As it happened, Stoke were relegated in 1925–26, leaving Vale in the Second Division and Stoke in the Third Division (North). On 19 May, Stoke decided against the proposal and the four Vale directors, including the chairman, who had come up with the plan, tendered their resignations.
In the summer of 1927 the club debated moving back to Cobridge, building a 50,000 capacity stadium. However, with the city council having a first option on a repurchase of The Old Recreation Ground, and offering a mere £20,000, the plan was killed.
At the end of the 1928–29 season the club were relegated to the Third Division North for the first time in their history. To make matters even more grim, goal machine Kirkham was sold to rivals Stoke, though the £2,800 fee was of some comfort.
1929–1939: Pre–war ups and downs.
In 1929–30, only the two champions of the Third Divisions (North and South) would be promoted. The sale of Kirkham allowed for the strengthening of the team in other areas, though their talisman would still be missed. On 29 September 1929, manager Joe Schofield died, with Vale top of the league. Reserve team coach Tom Morgan was put in charge of first team affairs. The club's terrific form continued, and they finished the season as champions on 67 points. Their total of 37 goals conceded was the strongest defensive record in all four divisions.
The 1930–31 was one of the strongest in the club's history. A fifth–place finish in the second tier was achieved mostly thanks to a solid defence. At the end of the season the club profited from a mini–tour of the Netherlands, where they recorded two victories over the Dutch Southern XI and a team of international reserves. However a loss of £800 was made on the season.
Top scorer for two seasons running, Sam Jennings was transferred to Stockport County; age was quickly catching up with the veteran striker. Jennings was one of many moved on or sold; Phil Griffiths was also moved on, sold to Everton for £6,000. The new team fared poorly and were skirting the bottom of the division by Christmas time. A major boost came therefore, with the re–signing of Wilf Kirkham from Stoke City in January. They finished the season in 20th position, escaping relegation only on goal average.
To fare better in 1932–33, the team was reshuffled. The club said goodbye to long serving custodian Bob Connelly and former England international and Villa legend Richard York. Manager Tom Morgan was also replaced, with former manager Tom Holford reinstated. However the club again narrowly avoided relegation and had little cause for celebration, though a profit was made financially.
Once more the club had a clear out. Under–performers were let go, as was Kirkham, who chose to pursue a career in education rather than football. The club had a strong 1933–34 on the pitch, finishing in eight place. Billy Tabram held strong at the back while Tom Nolan was scoring consistently. However the season was a financial disaster. As a result fifteen players were let go, including Bill Cope, Jimmy McGrath and Len Armitage, Tabram was sold to Hull City for a good profit, as was Fred Mills and George Poyser to Leeds United and Brentford respectively.
The 1934–35 season was largely forgettable on the pitch, apart from a close FA Cup game with eventual runners–up West Bromwich Albion. However in the middle of the season there were calls for a change of name; supporters were barely in favour, with names such as 'Stoke Central' and 'Stoke United' suggested. A meeting of shareholders discussed the name of 'Stoke North End', though the eventually settled on 'Hanley Port Vale'. This new name was not favoured by the fans and talk of a name change lingered for a few years before eventually falling away.
Vale suffered relegation in 1935–36. The pre–season consisted of selling top striker Tom Nolan to Bradford Park Avenue and manager Holford talking of a 'young players policy'. The season finished in a second–from–bottom finish and another plea for donations to survive financially.
Warney Cresswell was appointed as manager for the club's 1936–37 campaign, with the aim of promotion. Tom Nolan was also brought back from Bradford. After a mid–table finish Creswell left the club. A young Eric Hayward was transferred to Blackpool, Ken Gunn moved onto Northampton Town and Allan Todd went to Nottingham Forest. Roger Jones also ended his fourteen year association with the club.
In December 1937 Tom Morgan was reinstated as manager. He was unable to prevent the 1937–38 season being another story of mid–table mediocrity. Jack Roberts impressive tally of 28 goals was the only ray of hope for escaping the division. At the end of the season roughly half the team were transferred or let go.
Notable new faces for the 1938–39 campaign were goalkeeper Arthur Jepson, defender George Collin and right–half George Hannah. The club was also transferred to the Third Division South, good news as the league saw higher gate receipts. The club failed to have any impact on the division though, and were fighting to avoid a re–election battle rather than achieve promotion, as injuries hit the squad.
1939–1950: World War II and the post–war revival.
With the outbreak of war in Europe and Vale sitting bottom of the Third Division South after two games, the 1939–40 season was cancelled as Britain and the allies fought a brutal war against Nazi Germany and the axis.
Stoke–on–Trent was deemed a 'neutral and reception area' and so football throughout the war was permitted. However many players went off to war and the club could not compete in the war leagues due to financial limitations and the loss of players to the war effort. They did manage to sustain a youth team which enjoyed great success locally. The death of Major W.M.Huntbach, chairman of the club, left the greatly in debt. This left the club with no option but to sell The Old Recreation Ground to the city council. The deal went through on 31 October 1940 for £13,500, the council refusing the club's permission to rent the ground. The club were therefore left homeless and without any professional players in the middle of a world war. However the council had a change of heart and decided to permit the club to rent the ground until a few seasons after the end of the war, eventually extending the deal to 20 June 1950.
By the summer of 1944 the club had revived their first team, had found a location in Hamil Road, Burslem for their new stadium and had started a fund to raise £30,000 for this purpose. Jack Diffin was appointed team manager to supervise the 1944–45 roster of games.
With Germany and Japan's defeat peace was restored and the 1946–47 season began. Morris Jones bagged 26 goals as the club finished in a respectable tenth place. It was also the club's most successful year financially up to that point, with a net profit of over £4,000 recorded.
Jones lost his scoring touch in 1947–48 and was sold to Swindon Town for £2,500 in November 1947. The club finished in eighth, but made a loss in the transfer market and over the season as a whole.
The 1948–49 was largely forgettable, though the club made record profits of just over £7,000. The five figure sum received for Bill Pointon played a big part in this profit.
The club started 1949–50 with 86 players, though only 27 of these were full–time professionals. A pre–season acquisition of a young Ray King from Ashington would later prove significant, though the signing of defender Lol Hamlett would be of greater short team importance. The season saw another mid–table finish, though most of the talk was on the subject of the up–and–coming stadium in Burslem. A massive £20,000 was raised for the sale of Ronnie Allen to West Brom. One major set–back was government refusal of permission to transfer of a stand from the old stadium to the new, despite the protestations of local MP Albert Davies.
1950–1959: New stadium, new triumphs.
In 1950, Vale Park was completed. The 1950–51 season was the first at their new home. The stadium was impressive, but the team not so, yet again failing to improve on mid–table. The players had to familiarise themselves with a much larger stadium and pitch. Along with their new stadium came a new player – Roy Sproson. In March, Bill McGarry was sold to Huddersfield Town for £12,000. He had moved on to better things and after impressing at the First Division club was selected for the England team.
Still working on the new stadium, especially trying to solve the drainage problem, the club were very quiet on the transfer front for the start of the 1951–52 campaign. In September, Alan Martin was exchanged with rivals Stoke for £10,000 and Albert Mullard. Initially against the trade, supporters eventually warmed to Mullard, who was the top scorer of the season. The team suffered before Christmas and manager Ivor Powell was sacked – to the relief of the players. On Christmas Eve Freddie Steele became manager. He managed to bring the club back into the safety of mid–table.
Steele quickly established himself at the club, masterminding the celebrated 'Iron Curtain' defence. He worked largely with the players already at the club, who were quite young and therefore easier to mould into the players he needed. The FA switched the club to the Third Division North in 1952–53. With a haul of 58 points the club were unfortunate to lose out only one point off champions Oldham Athletic and therefore remain in the third tier. A remarkable 35 goals were conceded in 46 games, but the attack was disappointing, though Basil Hayward did manage 22 goals.
The 1953–54 saw Vale storming to the Third Division North title as well as reaching the semi–finals of the FA Cup, losing out to eventual winners West Brom in very controversial fashion, seeing an Albert Leake goal disallowed for offside. Villa Park saw an attendance of 68,221 for the game. The defence of Ray King, Stan Turner, Reg Potts, Albert Mullard, Tommy Cheadle and Roy Sproson was key to the "Valiants" success, missing just ten games between them. Their league record of 21 goals conceded in 46 games is a Football League record that stands today. Just five of these were conceded at Vale Park. Champions of the Southern Division Ipswich Town had the next best defensive record in the Football League with a total of thirty more goals conceded than Vale.
The 'no buy, no sell' policy was unsurprisingly continued into 1954–55. They fared poorly, though were some way off relegation. Their weakness in front of goal continued, top scorer Cyril Done managed just thirteen goals, having joined in December 1954 from Tranmere Rovers. The average home attendance of 20,708 is a club record that still stands today. However, having spent almost £7,000 in transfer fees the club barely broke even.
The club's youth policy continued into 1955–56. However in January 1956, the club broke their own transfer record to secure the services of "Spurs" striker and former England international Eddie Baily, at a cost of £7,000. The club finished twelfth, just three points off third place Liverpool.
The 1956–57 campaign was a disaster, the club relegated with 22 points in 22nd place. Norman Low replaced Freddie Steele in February 1957, but the team showed little improvement. Cyril Done was the top scorer with a mere nine goals, while the team scored just four goals away from home.
The 1957–58 season was unique, as the bottom twelve in both Third Divisions would be relegated to a newly created Fourth Division. Low made many changes of personal, making the team barely recognisable to that of the glory days just a few years earlier. New man Stan Steele rifled in a total of 22 goals, but it was not enough to prevent a 15th place finish, and therefore a ticket to the new fourth tier.
Their first season in this new division was extremely successful, as the club took the title with a club record 110 goals. Normal Low picked out three star players: 'the supreme goalscorer' Graham Barnett, 'the find of the season' Ken Hancock and that 'model of consistency' Stan Steele. With five forwards hitting double figures, a profit being made and the gate receipts increasing, optimism was high in Burslem, especially with the Bycars End terrace work being completed leading to an overall capacity of 50,000.
1959–1969: The Sixties.
On 9 January 1960, Port Vale gave 'one of the finest performances in their history', beating high flying Second Division outfit Cardiff City 2–0 at Ninian Park, and 'thoroughly deserved' their Third Round victory. In round four, 'the defence took the honours' in a 1–0 win at second tier Scunthorpe United. The fifth round held eventual Second Division champions Aston Villa, who ran out 2–1 winners at Vale Park. Their fine cup form did not transfer over to the league however, and a mid–table position finished the 1959–60 season. Stan Steele was an ever–present for the third season running.
The club meant business in 1960–61, as proven by a £10,000 attempt to sign Villa's Gerry Hitchens. In January, Albert Leake left for Macclesfield Town, leaving Roy Sproson the only surviving member of the legendary 1953–54 outfit. After Stan Steele was 'rested' following 195 consecutive appearances and consequently put in a transfer request. In March 1961 he moved to West Brom for a £10,000 fee. Cliff Portwood's 26 goals helped the club achieve a seventh place finish.
In preparation for 1961–62, Steele was bought back from The Hawthorns for the same price he was sold for. However, a 'shock' came with the same of Cliff Portwood to Grimsby Town for £6,000. Manager Low believed the team was 'capable of promotion'. On 2 October, 22,895 witnessed Czechoslovakia defeat Port Vale 3–1. Later in the month £6,000 was spent on bringing Colin Grainger from Leeds United. On 27 January, Vale visited Second Division Sunderland in the FA Cup fourth round, almost 50,000 fans witnessed £50,000 Brian Clough effectively contained by the Vale defence as a goalless draw saw the "Mackems" pay a visit to Vale Park. In the replay, Vale recorded a 3–1 win in 'a magical piece of soccer history'. In the fifth round the club were defeated 1–0 by top flight Fulham. Another mid–table finish and small profit ended the season.
The club's poor start to 1962–63 left a heckled Stan Steele transfer listed. On 30 October Low shocked the fans with his resignation, even more surprisingly old boss Freddie Steele was reinstataed. The "Steele curtain" returned to Vale Park, as the team went 525 minutes without conceding a goal, ironically this run was ended by Ronnie Allen, now with Crystal Palace scored an otherwise meaningless consolation goal. The previous season's top scorers Bert Llewellyn and Arthur Longbottom were sold to Northampton Town for £7,000 and Millwall for £2,000 respectively. On 13 March the club went out of the FA Cup at the fourth round, defeated 2–1 by top tier Sheffield United. Tony Richards was bought for £9,000 in March and amazingly became the season's top scorer with 13 goals in three months and 14 games. With rivals Stoke promoted from the second tier and Crewe from the fourth, Vale finished in third, four points off the Second Division.
Determined to win promotion in 1963–64, the club spent £15,000 a piece on Northern Ireland international Billy Bingham and Englishman Albert Cheesebrough. Tim Rawlings was also bought for £4,000 from nearby Walsall. Soon into the season winger Ron Smith was also purchased from Crewe for £6,500. Scotsmen Jackie Mudie and Ron Wilson were transferred from Stoke City for around £12,000. The club did well in the FA Cup, taking Liverpool to a fourth round replay, however the season was a disaster in the league. It was 'the season that misfired', having spent a massive amount of money (nearly £50,000 alone in transfer fees) they finished a whole ten places lower than the previous season. The club made a net loss of £42,650, even with the regular donation from the Supporters Association of close to £20,000.
The club flopped completely in 1964–65. Goalkeeper Ken Hancock was sold to Ipswich Town at Christmas time, raising £10,000. Freddie Steele departed in February, as Jackie Mudie was appointed caretaker manager. Mudie created 'a punchier attack and a far more stable defence' as the club managed four home wins in a row. However the club were relegated in 22nd place, five points away from safety. No club in the Football League had scored less than Vale's tally of 41, with top scorer Cheesebrough managing just seven strikes. To slash the wage bill, Stan Steele, Ron Smith, Ron Andrew, Tim Rawlings and Stan Trafford all left on free transfers. The season saw a financial loss of around £15,000, the home attendance being an average of around 5,500.
Stanley Matthews was made general manager in preparation for the 1965–66, his emphasis was strongly on nurturing young talent. As a demonstration of this, over 700 boys were given trials with the club. Centre–half John Nicholson made a club record 208 consecutive appearances before being dropped in favour of Terry Alcock. This unsettled Nicholson, who was soon sold to Doncaster Rovers for £5,000. That money was spent on bringing former Northern Ireland international Jimmy Hill to Vale Park. In a nod to the youth policy, in one game four teenagers made their débuts: Alex Donald, Roddy Georgeson, Mick Cullerton and Paul Ogden. At the age of 15 years 347 days, Malcolm James MacKenzie made his debut against Newport County on 12 April 1966, the youngest player ever to play for the club. The club finished just two points away from re–election, in 19th position, they could hardly sink any deeper. Nearly £30,000 was lost that season, an average home gate of 6,000 would have to double for the club to break even.
After a good start to 1966–67, the previous season's top scorer John Rowland was sold to Mansfield Town for £6,500. A 'gloom' descended, multiplied by matters such as debt and the death of ex–player John Nicholson. The season tailed off, especially with new signing, former Welsh international Mel Charles failing to impress. Just before the season ended, John Ritchie was sold to Preston North End for £17,500, to help pay off an £80,000 overdraft. On 8 May, Mudie resigned as player-manager due to 'personal reasons'. The club finished in mid–table with a financial loss, despite making a profit in the transfer market. It was noted that 'the weekly income is insufficient to maintain the club. On a more positive note, Roy Sproson was awarded the first 'player of the year' award by the club.
Numerous players were let go before the 1967–68 campaign began; a young Ray Kennedy's departure would be bitterly regretted over the next two decades. The club also 'reluctantly' accepted a £25,000 Blackpool bid for Terry Alcock. Two new signings were Roy Chapman and Mick Morris, both free transfers. The club took a pre–season tour of Czechoslovakia. In November the FA launched an investigation into alleged breaches of rules on payments to players by the club. By January the investigation became a commission, looking charges of weekly wages for 'amateurs', playing schoolboys, extra bonuses for victories, and an illegal signing on bonus and other bonuses paid to John Ritchie, as well as bonuses to Clint Boulton and Gordon Logan, as well as gifts to young players that broke FA rules. In February the club admitted to the charges and were fined £2,000, later doubled, and told that irrespective of where they finished in the table, they would be made to apply for re-election to the Football League at the end of the season. On 8 June they were readmitted to the league by 39 votes to 9. Stanley Matthews 'gradually drifted out of the picture' and Gordon Lee was appointed as manager.
In 1968–69, Lee won respect for his 'honesty and enthusiasm' as the club consolidated their league status. Bill Asprey retired to go into coaching in a quiet season for the club. Football hooliganism started to take its grip on the game, and Vale's early experience of it consisted of witnessing the Chester City team coach smashed with bricks. At the end of the season the club were in debt to the tune of £178,277, with a £10,900 loss being made on the season. Already strict economies were tightened by the club hierarchy.
1969–1983: Just getting by.
Over the summer of 1969 there were talks of bringing speedway to Vale Park, introducing a new team to the Speedway British League Division Two. However many were opposed to the idea, and a 2,600 strong petition was given to local MP John Forrester. The idea was killed when the council failed to grant planning permission, despite a 3,000 strong petition in favour of the proposal. Port Vale dragged themselves out of the fourth tier and into the third in 1969–70, finishing in fourth place, three points away from the nearest competition. They had done this on the back of a solid defence, just about scoring enough goals to gather the necessary points. The club's chairman was arrested in February in non–football matter and consequently resigned, he was replaced by Mark Singer.
The most notable fresh face for 1970–71 was Brian Horton, though at first there was little to suggest how important the 21-year old from non–league Hednesford Town would be. Soon into the campaign four of the club's five directors resigned, claiming 'the club is being controlled by outsiders'. Long serving player Ron Wilson also left, emigrating to South Africa to look after his son, who was suffering with bronchitis. The club made a rare profit, though the fans were restless with lower mid–table finish, despite Lee having built the squad on free transfers.
Young hopeful Sammy Morgan was persuaded to stay on for the 1971–72 campaign, as Lee largely stuck with the same squad, though he warned supporters that low attendances would force him to sell his best players. The season was largely forgettable, though increasing violence from hooligans was a cause for concern. £30,000 was raised by sale of some land and £10,000 was gained from Tony Lacey's move to Rochdale. 'Troubles at the top' were eventually settled with the re–election of old chairman Mark Singer. Only 2,743 turned up for the final appearance of club legend Roy Sproson, as Lee became increasingly angered by low turnouts. Only eleven points were won at home, as the club finished in mid–table yet again.
Long serving players Mick Morris and Keith Ball were released, as was John Flowers. Numerous new signings were made for 1972–73, most notable Ray Williams. After a 7–0 thrashing by Rotherham United – blamed largely on Alan Boswell, the side went on a run of five wins. Lee continued to bemoan the fans, saying 'the people here are not genuinely interested in league football', though he turned down a job offer at Shrewsbury Town out 'of loyalty to the players'. Vale went out of the FA Cup 1–0 to West Ham United in the third round, Ron Greenwood claimed 'we were lucky to come out alive' after Vale gave a physical display, though Lee defended his players 'enthusiasm'. What was indefensible however was the violence of a minority of supporters, leaving two Londoners nursing stab wounds. In January John James went to Chester for £5,000. They finished the season in sixth, four points away from promotion.
Before 1973–74 was under way, Sammy Morgan was sold to Aston Villa for just over £20,000. The defence was strengthened with the signings of David Harris, Keith Chadwick and John Ridley. In January, Lee took the job at Blackburn Rovers. The appointment of Roy Sproson as his replacement marked a great change for the dressing room atmosphere, as Sproson was more relaxed and insisted upon a more 'entertaining' style of play. Ill discipline on the pitch caused Sproson to arrange a lecture by a local referee to calm his players down and avoid bookings. The club finished poorly, though avoided relegation.
New signings for 1974–75 included Terry Bailey, Frank Sharp and John Connaughton. The club pushed for promotion, but registered another sixth place finish, again four points from promotion. This time it was their away form that cost them.
A dire financial situation meant seven players were released for 1975–76: John Woodward, Tony Lacey, Roy Cross, Bill Summerscales, Frank Sharp and Reg Edwards. Attempts to sign Welsh internationals Mike England and Wyn Davies failed, and so Mick Cullerton, Terry Lees and Geoff Morris were the only new signings. Cullerton was in fine scoring form, though the promotion campaign fell away and Horton was sold to Brighton for £30,000, which led to a healthy profit on the season. For the club's centenary celebrations a match was held with Stoke City, which finished 1–1, an impressive result considering the "Potters" were going through one of the most successful periods in their history.
The small squad barely changed for 1976–77; Kevin Kennerley and Ian Osborne replacing an outgoing Geoff Morris. The FA slapped the club with a £400 fine for poor discipline, the club therefore began fining players for unacceptable behaviour on the pitch. Terry Lees was sold to Sparta Rotterdam for £25,000. £12,000 of this money was spent on striker Ken Beamish. Former England international Bobby Thomson was also brought in and quickly made captain. The club continued in their physical footballing ways, opposition manager Jimmy McGuigan describing it as 'the worst example of football thuggery I have ever seen' and Burnley captain Peter Noble calling Vale 'a bunch of kickers'. In the FA Cup they lost at the Fifth Round to a crowd of nearly 50,000 at Villa Park. In the league they clung on to their third tier status, safe by only three points.
Before the 1977–78 season began, Tommy McLaren was released, as was Eric Skeels, Ian Osborne and coach Roy Chapman. David Harris also refused a new contract, for the same reason Sammy Morgan's £12,000 return did not go through. The club's hierarchy displayed their dissatisfaction with manager Roy Sproson. He was sacked in October and never returned to Vale Park. After a spell under caretaker–manager Colin Harper, ex–Bury manager Bobby Smith was appointed to the job. He made Dennis Butler his assistant. In January, Neville Chamberlain became the club's first black professional. Colchester United's John Froggatt was also brought in for £10,000. Frugal spending out of the window, the club still almost managed to break even. However the club were relegated back into the Fourth Division in 21st place.
Seven players were let go before the 1978–79 campaign. Manager Bobby Smith left to take up the vacant management position at Swindon Town, leaving his replacement Dennis Butler to take over the reins at Vale. Forward Bernie Wright came in from Bradford City for £9,000. In August the club broke their transfer record for Wolves midfielder Ken Todd, paying £37,000 for a youngster with just five league appearances to his name. John Frogatt was sold for £8,000, Terry Bailey for £2,000 and Mick Moore for £2,000. Ken Beamish also was sold to Bury for £35,000, whereas Vale bought his teammate Gerry Keenan for £15,000. £8,000 was also spent on Irishman Felix Healy. In late October the club received a record £55,000 from Leicester City for John Ridley. Another club record was set when £40,000 was spent on Bury's Peter Farrell. The new signings did not bed down well, the fans were restless and Butler retaliated by calling them 'a bunch of yobbos'. The club recorded a loss of £52,000 in the hectic season, wages being doubled from £113,000 to £259,000 and the club's liabilities were now at £187,000. The club chairman stood down and was replaced by Arthur McPherson.
The 1979–80 season started with six straight defeats, including an early exit from the League Cup. Poor discipline also resulted in a £500 fine from the FA. Dennis Butler's short reign came to an end and Alan Bloor was made caretaker manager. In an attempt to shake things up he dropped Bernie Wright in favour of young Neville Chamberlain. A satisfactory upturn in fortunes saw Bloor handed the management position on a permanent basis. In December, the club became the first in their division to strike a shirt sponsorship deal– with T.I.Creda. However Bloor resigned, saying he 'did not have what it takes', reserve coach Gordon Banks was also dismissed. John McGrath was given the top job, and appointed Torquay United coach John Rudge as his number two. To battle against indiscipline in the squad McGrath issued two fines in his first fortnight. In February he transfer listed fifteen players. At the end of the season the club narrowly avoided facing re–election and a loss of £82,069 was reported. Their 20th place finish in the Fourth Division (88th overall) was the club's worst ever finish. However local rivals Crewe Alex were three places below them, giving the supporters some small comfort.
Despite a massive clear–out, only two new signings were made in preparation for 1980–81; John Allen and Trevor Brissett both came in on free transfers. Little progress was made on the previous season, as the club finished 19th. The club also 'died in shame' in the FA Cup third round, defeated 3–0 by Isthmian League side Enfield. Nevertheless, McGrath noted 'the attitude is slowly changing the better'. Record low average home attendance figures of 2,738 inevitably caused a financial loss on the season, though costs were being reduced.
McGrath tried and failed to re–sign Brian Horton for 1981–82, with £12,000 Ernie Moss being the most high–profile transfer, along with £15,000 midfielder Geoff Hunter. McGrath pointed out that 'forwards are much more important now' as the Football League changed the system so that wins were rewarded with three points instead of two. For the first time in a decade, the club made it into the second round of the League Cup. Colin Tartt was re–signed from Chesterfield for £15,000 as the club made a push for promotion. Injury problems eventually made promotion unattainable, though 70 points and a 7th place finish gave cause for optimism, despite a club record low attendance for a league game of 1,924 in a goalless draw with York City on 1 May. Twelve home draws resulted in McGrath's observation that 'we blew it at Burslem'. Financially, a loss of £65,000 was recorded to bring the club's overdraft close to £250,000.
Another clear–out left just eleven professionals on the books for the 1982–83 season. Four of the more important newcomers were John Ridley, Wayne Cegielski, Les Lawrence and Steve Waddington. In August, Mark Chamberlain and Mark Harrison were sold to rival's Stoke for a combined fee of £180,000. There was little option to sell due to the financial situation, though McGrath's plans were heavily disrupted. As a result five players made their débuts on the opening game of the season. A bold attempt to sign Mick Channon failed, forcing McGrath to settle for dedicated forward Bob Newton. The season finished with promotion, third place with seven points to spare. A profit of just over £100,000 was also made, reversing a seven-year trend of losses.
In preparation for 1983–84, Eamonn O'Keefe was signed for £10,000 from Wigan Athletic. The summer was dominated by reports that several players failed to sign contracts and were unhappy with the club. McGrath's tactics at the start of the season were more attacking than usual and the results were poor as the club went eighteen games without a victory. McGrath bemoaned the board's lack of support and was consequently 'gagged', only being permitted to talk to the press on team matters. On 26 November Vale suffered a humiliating 7–0 loss at Burnley in front of the television cameras, all goals being scored in the first half. By December, Port Vale were nine points off safety, paying £9,000 a week in wages (the third highest sum in the division) and with home gate receipts averaging at £3,000. On the 6th, McGrath was suspended on full pay, despite a flurry of letters in support of him being sent into the club, 'some just abusive'.
1983–1999: The Rudge era.
John Rudge took over the management reins at Vale Park in December 1983, after the sacking of John McGrath following the club's form upon Vale's promotion to the Third Division. Rudge said that 'we cannot change things overnight', though did spark 'an amazing transformation of form' to oversee four consecutive home wins. The gap from safety was closed from nine to four points and by March he had 'achieved mission impossible' as the club escaped the relegation zone. However a poor end to the season saw the club relegation in 23rd place. Positive signs for the future included a £50,601 profit and the rise to prominence of young striker Mark Bright. Yet Bright left in the summer, moving to Leicester City for £33,000. Top scorer Eamonn O'Keefe also requested a transfer, but did not get one.
Rudge steadied the ship, slashing the wage bill by £20,000. A young Robbie Earle began to show his promise, though it was veteran Alistair Brown who was the season's top scorer, with 21 strikes. A mid–table finish was acceptable considering the rebuilding effort Rudge made with the squad. In May 1985, young Welshman Andy Jones was purchased from Rhyl for £3,000. He was soon joined by £12,000 defender John Williams and numerous others.
Vale were promoted back to the third tier in 1985–86, finishing in fourth place, losing just once at Vale Park. During the season, they went on an eighteen-match unbeaten run, building their record largely on a solid defence. Jones and Earle scored eighteen and seventeen goals respectively. The only downside was the finances, as a loss of £79,474 was recorded, partly due to promotion bonus payouts.
In the summer of 1986, new signings included Ipswich Town's reserve goalkeeper Mark Grew on a free, Aston Villa midfielder Ray Walker for £12,000, Sheffield United winger Paul Smith for £10,000 and Walsall striker Richard O'Kelly for £6,000. Rudge also turned down the management position at Preston North End. He also made an attempt to bring a young Steve Bull to Vale Park. After an unconvincing start to 1986–87, Rudge sold John Williams to Bournemouth for £30,000 and brought in Bob Hazell from Reading on a free. This helped transform the club's defence, while Andy Jones' fantastic record of 37 goals helped win the Vale a twelfth place finish. The only worrying sign was a £53,373 loss, increasing the club's debt to £363,878.
A major change occurred before the start of the 1987–88 season, as chairman Jim Lloyd stood down and was replaced by hard nosed businessman Bill Bell. Ten year man Russell Bromage went to Bristol City in exchange for £25,000 and Lawrie Pearson, also Jon Bowden went to Wrexham for £12,500. Coming in was striker Darren Beckford for £15,000. Going into the season, Paul Smith went to Lincoln City for £40,000, before Andy Jones was sold for a then–club–record fee of £350,000 to Charlton Athletic. £35,000 of this went towards new full–back Simon Mills. The campaign was boosted by a 'famous' 2–1 victory over top-flight Tottenham Hotspur in the fourth round of the FA Cup. The cup run and sale of Jones had helped to pull in a record £410,239 profit.
A boost for 1988–89 came with the sale of an unused training ground at Cobridge for £164,800. Half way through the season, veteran Phil Sproson was advised to retire following a serious knee injury; to replace him, defender Dean Glover was signed from Middlesbrough for a club–record £200,000. The club finished third, failing to gain automatic promotion because of their worse goal difference. However they found success in the play–offs, defeating Bristol Rovers in the play–offs 2–1 on aggregate.
Back in the Second Division for the first time in over twenty years, Rudge strengthened the side with £150,000 signing Neil Aspin from Leeds United, £125,000 striker Nicky Cross from Leicester City and veteran campaigner Ian Miller on a free. The 1989–90 saw many improvements being made to Vale Park, as on the pitch the team did well to establish themselves in the division. They also triumphed in the FA Cup, putting three past Derby County's Peter Shilton in a third round replay victory. However, in the next round 'Villa went on a rampage', as they 'outclassed' the Vale with a 6–0 victory. They finished eleventh in the league and the supporters were given much to cheer about as rivals Stoke City were relegated to the third tier, leaving Vale as 'the top team in the Potteries' for only the second time in their history.
Only one change was made to the squad in preparation for the 1990–91 campaign: Irishman Derek Swan coming in from Bohemians for £15,000 on a recommendation. The club considered building a new ground at Festival Park, but Bill Bell was 'frightened to death by the cost' and the idea was scrapped. The club finished in fifteenth place, Darren Beckford once again the top scorer with 23 goals.
They then went into a slump which led to their relegation on the final day of the 1991–92 league campaign.
In 1992–93, Vale narrowly missed out on promotion as runners–up to Reading when Bolton Wanderers pipped them on the final day. Vale then lost in the play–off final to West Bromwich Albion.
Vale were able to bounce back with Rudge's next two bargain buys becoming important players. Ian Taylor, whom Vale had signed for £15,000 from non–League Moor Green, and Dutch import Robin van der Laan (signed for £80,000) came to the fore. With Martin Foyle back fit and experienced Bernie Slaven up front, Vale surged to second place, confirming promotion on the final day with a 3–1 win at Brighton's Goldstone Ground in front of 6,000 travelling fans. Vale also notched another FA Cup scalp beating then–Premiership side Southampton 1–0 at Vale Park in a third–round replay.
Taylor became Rudge's first £1,000,000 sale, when Sheffield Wednesday invested in the midfielder. The money was spent on bringing Steve Guppy and Gareth Griffiths to the club during the 1994–95 campaign.
Vale finished seventeenth in 1994–95, avoiding relegation by ten points, and again in spite of the pre–season sale of van der Laan, who Derby bought for £475,000. Jon McCarthy and Lee Mills also joined before the 1995–96 season began.
During the 1995–96 season, Vale struggled to find their form. Ten games into the league season, they had recorded only one win (in the local derby against Stoke) and were struggling near the bottom of the table. Early home form was also the worst for years, and it took the Valiants until 2 December to finally notch a win at Vale Park, when Martin Foyle scored to beat Huddersfield Town 1–0. A 5–1 defeat at Ipswich on New Year's Day, saw Vale slip to second from bottom, with just five wins all season, but the FA Cup was again to prove the tonic.
The draw had done Vale no favours, with a trip to promotion–chasing Crystal Palace, but a goalless draw brought the tie back to Vale Park. Vale eventually won the tie, on a freezing January night, with Ray Walker scoring the winner in extra time to seal a 4–3 win, and set up a trip to cup–holders Everton in the fourth round.
In the tie with Everton, Vale twice came from behind at Goodison Park to draw 2–2, with Ian Bogie scoring from virtually the last kick of the match. The replay saw Vale Park full to capacity to witness Vale win 2–1 with Jon McCarthy netting the winner.
The victory saw Vale go into the fifth round, in which they would play Leeds United away. Leeds were then a top–ten Premiership side. The match at Elland Road took place on a Tuesday, thanks to various cancellations due to inclement weather. The game finished goalless, and the tie went to a replay in Burslem. The Valiants' cup exploits were to come to an end as Leeds won the replay 2–1 with Gary McAllister scoring twice in the closing stages despite Vale leading 1–0 at half time through Tony Naylor. However Vale's cup exploits were to earn them the FA's Giantkillers award for the 1995–96 season.
The cup run seemed to inspire Vale onto better things in the league, with a run of five wins in a row pushing them up to twelfth as the season drew to a close. Vale also had some success in the Anglo-Italian Cup, as they qualified for the final at Wembley, in the competition's final season. Vale secured a 5–3 win at Italian side Perugia in which Lee Mills netted a hat-trick. The English semi–final draw pitted Vale away to Ipswich Town, who they had already lost to 5–1. Tony Naylor scored a hat–trick as Vale recorded a 4–2 win at Portman Road, the first victory in their history at the ground.
A 3–1 victory in the second leg of the English final at Vale Park, against West Brom, confirmed a 4–2 aggregate success, and a game against Italian winners Genoa in the final. The Italians ran out 5–2 winners, with Martin Foyle netting both Vale goals.
Again, Vale made a slow start to the 1996–97 campaign, with only two wins from their opening ten league games. They enjoyed some success in the League Cup, however, beating local rivals Crewe Alexandra 5–1 at their Gresty Road home. A protest against chairman Bill Bell after a poor home defeat to Crystal Palace seemed to see an upturn in the Valiants' performances. A second win at Wolves' Molineux ground (1–0), in two seasons, was followed by a mixed period. In December they achieved three wins on the bounce, against ex–Premiership sides Charlton 3–1 at The Valley, 6–1 at home to Norwich City and concluding in a single–goal Boxing Day success at Manchester City in front of more than 30,000. Despite the sale of Steve Guppy to Leicester City for £800,000, Vale's form remained steady from then on, until five wins from six, from mid–March to mid–April, put them in with a chance of making the play–offs and, ultimately, a place in the Premiership. However, with three games remaining, Vale were to lose to Stoke City, before Wolves came away from Vale Park with a 2–1 victory to end their hopes. Vale's final finishing position of eighth was their highest in the pyramid since 1931, when they had finished fifth in the old Second Division.
The eighth–placed finish was to be the height of Vale's powers under John Rudge, and the following season, 1997–98, saw a more familiar mid–table and, eventually, relegation battle. Another FA Cup tie was Vale hold eventual winners Arsenal to a goalless draw at Highbury and 1–1 at Vale Park (Wayne Corden equalising a Dennis Bergkamp goal) before the Gunners eventually prevailed 4–3 on penalties, despite Lee Dixon missing their opening kick. Vale found themselves in deep relegation trouble going into the final match at Huddersfield after three straight defeats. Goals from Martin Foyle, Jan Jansson (two) and Lee Mills saw Vale claim a 4–0 win and an escape at the expense of Manchester City and Stoke City.
1998–99 saw Port Vale fare little better, with an early League Cup defeat to Chester City setting the tone. After sixteen years as Port Vale manager, John Rudge was sacked in January 1999 after one of Vale's most successful eras.
1999–2003: Post–Rudge worry.
Rudge was replaced by former player Brian Horton, who had been working at Brighton. Dwindling fortunes, both on the pitch and financially, put relegation on the cards. Horton made five transfer–deadline day signings costing £1,000,000, and Vale managed a second–consecutive final–day escape after losing just two of their remaining eight games. Although Vale lost by a single goal at Bury, the Valiants stayed up (at Bury's expense) by virtue of having scored more goals (this was the last of three seasons where 'goal difference' replaced 'goals scored' as the Football League's separator for teams on equal points; Port Vale's goal difference was in fact substantially worse than that of Bury, but Bury had the lowest goals scored total in the entire Football League, consigning them to relegation).
There was no escape in 1999–2000, however. It was Huddersfield who eventually sealed Vale's fate with a 2–1 win at Vale Park, with Vale ultimately going down thirteen points adrift.
A worsening financial crisis put the club's future in jeopardy by the end of 2000. Vale were in the relegation zone of the Second Division, and after a FA Cup first–round defeat to Ryman Leaguers Canvey Island, the team seemed to be heading towards another relegation, with fans once again protesting against chairman Bill Bell. However, there was change in fortunes after the turn of the year, as Brian Horton's team transformed their league form to pull up to a top–half finish while also gaining silverware by beating Brentford in the final of the LDV Vans Trophy. This included a post–war record of sixteen matches unbeaten in all competitions, with Vale eventually finishing eleventh.
After the League Trophy–winning season, the Valiants lost the services of veterans Tony Naylor and Allen Tankard, but young prospects Steve Brooker, Marc Bridge-Wilkinson and new signings Stephen McPhee and Ian Armstrong were waiting in the wings. However, Vale suffered from inconsistency, and finished the 2001–02 campaign in fourteenth place.
With further discontent at the running of the club, a supporters' trust under the banner "Valiant 2001" started moves towards attaining ownership of the club, including several offers that were rejected by chairman Bell.
The next season, 2002–03, was to see Vale's financial problems come to a head. With first–round exits in both cup competitions and another mediocre season in the league on the cards, Bill Bell eventually called in the administrators with the club around £1.5 million in debt.
2003–2011: Barely surviving under Valiant 2001.
Valiant 2001 eventually secured control of the club after a long and drawn–out process as the season neared its close. Bill Bratt became the new chairman, and even though the finances were still slim for quite a while, Vale were relatively buoyant. On the pitch, a brief cameo from veteran striker Brett Angell had kept the club above the relegation zone before Christmas with seven goals in fifteen games, and prodigy Billy Paynter helping out with five goals in a young–and–old partnership. However, with the financial problems, the funds were not found to keep Angell beyond November, and after a run of poor form Vale slipped into the bottom four in March.
With the concern of immediate extinction over, and Horton's resourceful signing of experienced Adrian Littlejohn (who scored three goals) the final ten games saw an upturn in form and Vale eventually finish in seventeenth place.
2003–04 was a new era for the club off the pitch, with the club coming out of administration under a new board of fan–ownership. A reduction in match– and season–ticket prices saw around 3,000 season tickets sold. On the pitch, the club had ridden out administration by avoiding relegation (the ten–point penalty did not apply in 2003) with Brian Horton building a young, pacey side.
The club made their best start to a season for many a year and found themselves top of the table at the end of September. Vale remained on course to at least be challenging for the play–offs come May. Their position in the table was based largely on the goals of an attacking front four: Billy Paynter and Adrian Littlejohn played on the right and left, while Steve Brooker and Stephen McPhee forming a partnership up front.
Despite a modicum of success, Horton left in February 2004 after the board revealed he would not be given a new contract on the same terms and his budget would be slashed due to cost–cutting after administration. He was to be replaced by former player Martin Foyle, who had been a success as the club's youth–team manager. Horton left the team in seventh place, just outside the play–offs, and this was ultimately where the club would finish after a final day at Rushden & Diamonds' Nene Park. Going into the game, Vale needed a win to overtake either Swindon or Hartlepool in the play–off places and hope one or the other lost. However, the twist was that both these teams were playing each other and needed just a point to deny Vale a play–off place – unless, that is, Vale won by seven clear goals. Vale dispatched Rushden with a 2–0 win (Steve McPhee scoring both and taking his tally to 27 for the season) but Swindon and Hartlepool played out a 1–1 draw at the County Ground, thus meaning Vale missed out on goal–difference.
Foyle spent almost four years as manager after this, but the style of football the team were playing did him few favours as Vale finished 17th and 13th in his first two full campaigns in charge despite promising starts. Arguably the club's best recent achievements came in the two major cup competitions in the calendar year of 2006. Vale made it to the 4th round of the FA Cup in 2005–06 which was the clubs first appearance at that stage since the clubs giantkilling exploits a decade earlier. Vale were drawn away to Premier League Aston Villa but were defeated 3–1, holding the Birmingham side well into the 2nd period before succumbing to 2 Milan Baroš strikes and although Nathan Lowndes pulled one back, Steven Davis scored Villa's third.
The following season the club set a record for progression in the League Cup beating three Championship sides at home to set up a tie at Spurs (the first time the sides had met since Vale's infamous win 19 years beforehand). Vale again gave Spurs more than a run for their money taking the lead through Leon Constantine, and were eleven minutes from a major upset before Spurs equalised to force extra time and eventually prevailed 3–1. The signing of Constantine was to prove a big success as he set a post war record by scoring 19 goals before Christmas 2006. Coupled with exciting strike partner Akpo Sodje Vale were up with the early pace setter for League One in 2006–07, however several runs of poor form saw the side fade away to finish 12th despite a striking partnership which contributed 42 goals (Constantine 26, Sodje 16). This added to a shocking 4–0 F.A. Cup defeat to then League Two Hereford United saw fans start to lose patience with Foyle, although he remained in charge before the 2007–08 campaign.
A poor start to the 2007–08 season, in which several of Foyle's major signings did not live up to expectation, resulted in his dismissal on 4 November 2007, with Vale in deep relegation trouble. He was succeeded by Lee Sinnott, but Sinnott was unable to prevent the club from sliding into League Two after a 23rd–place finish, as well as crashing out to Chasetown (an 8th tiered club) in the FA Cup Second Round. Financially the club also suffered, recording losses of £383,738.
2008–09 was Vale's first season in the bottom tier of the Football League in over twenty years. Despite relegation, positive pre–season once again followed in which a cut price season ticket initiative took place in an attempt to boost attendances and bring cheaper football to the masses. This saw Vale fans snap up 6,400 season tickets in readiness for what the club hoped would be a more successful season. However it did not materialise and Sinnott was sacked on 22 September 2008, after an unsuccessful start to their League Two campaign with the Valiants in 16th place, Dean Glover taking over as caretaker-manager for the second time in twelve months. He was appointed as manager on a permanent basis on 6 October. Glover did initially oversee a slight upturn in form as Vale won at previously unbeaten (at home) Shrewsbury Town, which instigated a run of four away wins out of five.
After these highs however the poor form returned with the club losing in the FA Cup second round to Macclesfield and ultimately losing out on a home tie with Premiership Everton. This coupled with the club sliding back into lower mid–table and a similar position to when Sinnott was sacked. 2009 began with fans starting to seriously question the boards motives and the direction the club was going in, especially when it was revealed former manager Lee Sinnott was taking court action against the club for a breach of contract after his dismissal. The 2008–09 season finished with the club in 18th place in League Two, only a final day win at Barnet ensuring the club avoided its worst ever points tally in the bottom tier of the Football League. After months of speculation it was announced on 1 May 2009 that a new manager would be found for the 2009–10 season, with Dean Glover standing down from the role. Off the field, the club recorded a loss of £280,000 – £100,000 less than the previous campaign, having slashed the player wage bill by more than £600,000 to £1.12 million.
On 4 June 2009, it was announced that Micky Adams would become the club's new manager. Adams made a solid start to his tenure impressing the Vale faithful with his honest attitude on the clubs situation and did not take long to write himself into the club's history books. In just his second match, a League Cup tie at Championship side Sheffield United, Vale ran out 2–1 winners. This becoming only the third time in the clubs history that they had won away at a side two leagues above their own status (the others were in 1954 and 1964, both in the FA Cup). In the second round it was a case of deja vu, as Sheffield rivals Wednesday were dispatched 2–0. After a period of three defeats in seven days, including being knocked out of the League Cup at the third round, Adams decided to place his whole squad on the transfer list, saying of his team's performance: “We looked like a woman who had a big fur coat on but underneath she’s got no knickers on.” He later admitted he merely played "a psychological game with them... I don't think they fell for it – I don't think anybody fell for it". Nevertheless they stormed into the play–off places for the first time in the season with just two games left to play. However a loss and a draw saw them finish the season in tenth place.
History repeated itself for the start of 2010–11, with Adams leading Vale to their fifth ever win over opposition two tiers higher than themselves, new signing Justin Richards scoring a brace in a 3–1 win at Queens Park Rangers in the League Cup First Round. Adams left the club in December 2010, with Vale second in the table, after his hometown club Sheffield United chose him as their new manager. Jim Gannon was appointed to finish the promotion job, having already masterminded Stockport County's escape from the division some years previous. Vale lost ground during the transition phase, though hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons in February, after Gannon and assistant Geoff Horsfield had a bust-up during a pre-match coach trip, which resulted in both men leaving the bus to return to Burslem. This argument proved to be just the tip of the iceberg, and Gannon was sacked in March after alienating most of the fans, players and staff. This ten-week reign was the shortest in the club's history for a permanent appointment. Mark Grew failed to lift the club back into the play-offs, though at the end of the season supporters were delighted to learn that Micky Adams would be returning as manager. Adams also took up a position as director, while chairman Bill Bratt resigned as chairman, and was replaced by Mike Lloyd. This, combined with promised investment into the club, quelled growing fan unrest. In September 2011, the investors were revealed to be sports construction firm Blue Sky International, who planned to plough £5 million into the club in twelve months, as well as a further £2.5 million by 2016. This sum would secure the long-term future of the club. Bratt resigned as a director in October 2011, as the Valiant2001 era drew to a close. However it quickly emerged that the deal was in jeopardy due to unforeseen 'contractual issues', and new chairman Peter Miller and CEO Perry Deakin came in for criticism from the fans after it was revealed that they had not purchased shares in the club as previously stated. In December, Blue Sky CEO Hank Julicher confirmed that neither his company or his family had invested any money into the club, and claimed that the £8 million deal the club had announced was pure fantasy. Supporters showed their disapproval against the board by displaying red cards in the home fixture against Aldershot Town, a game in which loanee Guy Madjo scored a hat-trick. By the end the year, Deakin had resigned from his post and the board decided to end Miller's reign as chairman.
2012–"present": A new era.
Genuine hopes of promotion in 2011–12 were brought to an end after the club were issued with a winding up petition by HM Revenue and Customs on 29 February 2012; the club were by this time unable to pay tax bills, creditors, or staff wages. The club entered administration on 9 March; the administrators appointed were Begbies Traynor. On 6 July, it was reported that Keith Ryder had completed his takeover of the club. However after two months of being told Ryder would complete the deal "tomorrow", the administrators opened negotiations with other parties, as the new season drew ever closer. Instead, Paul Wildes completed his takeover of the club on 20 November 2012. The 2012–13 season was a resounding success, with Tom Pope scoring 33 goals to fire Vale to promotion back to League One with a third-place finish.
Paul Wildes stepped down as chairman and was replaced by Norman Smurthwaite in May 2013. The club continued to progress in the league during the 2013–14, consolidating their League One status with a ninth place finish.

<doc id="21461479" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21461479" title="Murray's law">
Murray's law

Murray's law, or Murray's principle is a formula for relating the radii of daughter branches to the radii of the parent branch of a lumen-based system. The branches classically refer to the branching of the circulatory system or the respiratory system, but have been shown to also hold true for the branchings of xylem, the water transport system in plants.
Murray's original analysis was intended to determine the vessel radius that required minimum expenditure of energy by the organism. Larger vessels lower the energy expended in pumping blood because the pressure drop in the vessels reduces with increasing diameter according to the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. However, larger vessels increase the overall volume of blood in the system; blood being a living fluid requires metabolic support. Murray's law is therefore an optimisation exercise to balance these factors.
For formula_1 daughter branches arising from a common parent branch, the formula is:
formula_2
where formula_3 is the radius of the parent branch, and formula_4, formula_5, formula_6...formula_7 are the radii of the respective daughter branches.
Murray's law is seeing increasing use as a biomimetic design tool in engineering—for example it has recently been applied in the design of minimum mass vascular networks carrying a liquid healing agent to areas of damage in a self-healing material and the expression developed could readily be applied to minimum mass fluid systems in other engineering applications. The trade-off is directly analogous—larger diameter tubes are heavier because of both the tubing and the additional volume of enclosed fluid, but the pressure losses incurred are reduced and so the mass of the pumping system required is lower. The (inner) tube diameter formula_8 which minimizes the total mass (tube + fluid + pump), is given by the following equation in laminar flow:
formula_9
where formula_10 is the volume flow rate, formula_11 the fluid viscosity, formula_12 the power-to-weight ratio of the pump, formula_13 the density of the tubing material, formula_14 a constant of proportionality linking vessel wall thickness with internal diameter and formula_15 the density of the fluid.
For turbulent flow the equivalent relation (derived from the Darcy-Weisbach equation) is:
formula_16
where f is the Darcy friction factor. The junction relations above can therefore be applied in the following form in turbulent flow:
formula_17

<doc id="21461488" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21461488" title="Red Bull RB5">
Red Bull RB5

The Red Bull RB5 is a Formula One racing car designed by the Red Bull Racing team for the 2009 Formula One season. It was driven by Sebastian Vettel, who drove for Red Bull's sister team Toro Rosso in the 2008 season, and Mark Webber. The car was launched on 9 February 2009 at the Circuito de Jerez in Spain.
The car gave the team its first pole position, first win and first ever 1-2 finish at the 2009 Chinese Grand Prix. Over the course of the season the car turned out to be competitive as it won 6 out of 17 races, with Vettel winning four races and Webber winning two. As a result the team finished 2nd in the constructors' championship standings behind Brawn GP and Vettel finished second in the drivers' standings behind Jenson Button.
Technical specifications.
New rules in place for the 2009 season required cars to have narrower and higher rear wings and wider and lower front wings, designed to reduce air disturbance to following cars and hence make overtaking easier. Slick tyres were re-introduced into Formula One, after being absent since 1998. This was expected to increase the RB5's tyre grip by about 20%.
There was a possibility that the RB5 could feature a Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS), which would allow energy which would otherwise be wasted while braking to be re-used in set amounts per lap, via a boost button on the driver's steering wheel. This was the result of new rules for the 2009 season. Red Bull originally attempted to develop their own system, but a factory fire resulting from overheated batteries stalled progress. In January 2009 Red Bull announced that they would use an identical KERS system to the Renault team, in an extension of the existing customer engine deal between the teams. However the RB5 never did race with KERS.
2009 season.
Launch.
The RB5 was launched later than most of its rivals, to allow a longer development time at the expense of a shorter testing time. Red Bull expected the RB5 to be more competitive than its predecessor, the RB4, which achieved a single podium in 2008. Vettel was optimistic when questioned about the car's potential:
Sebastian Vettel, who (since joining Scuderia Toro Rosso) makes it a habit to name his racing cars, named his Red Bull RB5 'Kate' and after crashing it at Melbourne's Albert Park, he named his new chassis 'Kate's Dirty Sister'.
Testing.
Initial tests of the RB5 at Jerez were halted when high gearbox oil temperatures were detected. When the issue was resolved the RB5 was the quickest 2009 specification car at Jerez, where Vettel was faster than the equivalent Williams, McLaren and Renault cars. Webber returned to the cockpit after breaking his leg while cycling in November 2008; he completed 83 laps in the RB5, around the distance of a Grand Prix, and reported no problems whilst lapping faster than Vettel the previous day.
Newey gift car.
In July 2010, Red Bull gifted designer Adrian Newey a complete RB5 car as a thank you gift for turning Red Bull into a title-challenging team. Newey first drove the car at the hill at the Goodwood Festival of Speed.

The school was initially known as the "Tweede Afrikaanse Hoërskool" (Second Afrikaans Highschool), apparently also Afrikaans Medium. The school was later renamed Hoërskool Oosterland in a name-giving competition.
Name.
The name points historically to one of the ships with which the French Huguenots landed in 1688 (300 years prior to the opening of the school). Geographically, the name Oosterland (Easternland) has a link to the Eastern part of Secunda in which the school is situated, as well as to the location of Secunda in the former Eastern Transvaal (today Mpumalanga). The School is nicknamed "Oosies" by the pupils.
Principals.
The current principal is Elzette Botes, a teacher at the school since the opening, was formally inaugurated in 2009. The previous principal was LLJ van Der Merwe who was one of the founding fathers of the school and played a key role in the building and development of the school in its early years.
Dresscode.
The School is well known for its uniform which consists of a red jersey, a trademark of the school. The Student Council (Oosie Raad) plays a key role in the manner and order in the school, they are responsible for break time surveillance, attendance order and organisation of school functions. They are noticeable with their cream pants and blue jerseys which differ from the rest of the pupils dresscode.
Sport.
The School has top of the range sporting facility which consists of a gymnasium and a cricket academy (built in 2010). The First Pavilion was also built in 2010 on the west side of the A Rugby Field. The school also has Rugby fields, Hockey fields, Netball courts and tennis courts.
The Main focus is on the development of sport players in the school. The School participates annually in competitions in the following sport types: Rugby, Cricket (Male and Female), 7's Rugby, Hockey (Male And Female), Netball, Tennis, Jukskei and Athletics.

Philippe Henri de Girard patented in France spinning frames for both the dry and wet spinning of flax. His inventions were also patented in England in 1815, in the name of Horace Hall.
Little is known about Horace Hall, it is a possible pseudonym. Undoubtedly if he had taken out his patent in England in 1815, the year of the Battle of Waterloo, in a French name there would not have been a lot of enthusiasm for it; possibly even suspicion.
In the British Isles James Kay has been credited with the invention of this device. On 2 December 1826 shortly after Kay’s patent was awarded, Philippe Henri de Girard wrote to the Editor of The Manchester Guardian complaining about and pointing out he had been the inventor. The following is an extract from his letter:
It is probably not surprising that a French man, when France was at war with Britain, may have had to use a pseudonym when taking out a patent in England.

Attborough Swallet (also known as Red Quar Swallet) is a cave in Chewton Mendip in Somerset, England.
It is unusual for a cave on the Mendip Hills in that it is not in limestone but instead in Dolomitic Conglomerate and Marl. The main part of the cave was first entered in 1992, although Red Quar Swallet had been dug in the 1930s and the entrance shaft is now a concrete pipe. .
It takes its name from the Attborough field in which the entrance is situated. Red Quar Swallet comes from the small scale quarrying of red Triassic conglomerate.

The two main branches of this discipline are electrotherapy and electrophysiologic testing (EEG, electromyography, etc.) Clinical electrophysiology can be utilized in the study and treatment of various physiological conditions, and most notably in clinical cardiac electrophysiology.
Clinical cardiac electrophysiology.
Cardiac Electrophysiology (also referred to as clinical cardiac electrophysiology, arrhythmia services, or electrophysiology), is a branch of the medical specialty of clinical cardiology and is concerned with the study and treatment of rhythm disorders of the heart.
Assessment of the Eye.
Through the use of electrophysiological techniques, dissections of the visual system can be made. The use of both electrophysiological information in conjunction with other clinical tests, imaging, and field instrumentation, a deep and comprehensive assessment of the ocular and visual pathways can be made. Alone, electrophysiology can also monitor ocular disease, determining drug-induced ocular toxicity, and evaluating individuals at risk for familial eye disease.
Electroanalgesia.
Clinical electrophysiology has been used to modulate pain for over a century. Equipment designs have improved significantly since the advent of electroanalgesia and application has been made much easier. The use of electrotherapy to modulate pain is characterized in one of four ways: subsensory-level stimulation, sensory-level stimulation, motor-level stimulation, and noxious-level stimulation. Commercial stimulators can typically achieve any of the four levels of stimulation, though some stimulators may be more adept at a certain levels of stimulation than others. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is an umbrella term used to characterize all forms of electroanalgesia utilizing surface electrodes applied to the skin.
Subsensory-level stimulation.
Peak amplitudes are typically below 1 mA and do not produce phase charges strong enough to excite peripheral nerve fibers and reach the sensory threshold. Stimulators that work at this level are termed microcurrent electrical nerve stimulators (MENS). In addition to the low amplitudes, pulse durations are short, thereby activating neither the muscle nor the nerve. No studies have shown clinical effectiveness of subsensory-level stimulation. While trade publications and clinical seminars have claimed the effectiveness of MENS on a variety of conditions, the intensity of the stimulation is too low for sensory nerve stimulation. While some researches claim that the microcurrent has an effect on the cellular activity, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of MENS in electroanalgesia.
Sensory-level stimulation.
Defined as stimulation at or above the sensory threshold and below the motor threshold, sensory-level stimulation is frequently achieved with a frequency in the 50-100 pps range, with short pulse and phase durations of 2-50 μs, and low intensities. Short pulses must be used to avoid producing tetanic muscular contractions - muscular movement is not desirable in sensory-level TENS.
Amplitude is adjusted to achieve superficial cutaneous nerve fiber activation. The patient should perceive paresthesia beneath the electrodes and amplitude is adjusted according to patient feedback. The mechanism of action for this level of electroanalgesia is likely either the direct peripheral block of nerve transmission or the activation of central inhibition mechanisms of pain transmission by large-diameter fiber stimulation.
Sensory-level stimulation is the most researched level of electroanalgesia and is usually perceived by the patient as very comfortable. There should be an immediate decreased response to pain and treatment times last 20–30 minutes.
Motor-level stimulation.
Response to motor-level stimulation is often not immediately but its effect is long-lasting. Due to the lack of immediate effect, treatment times are typically longer and are conducted for 45 minutes or longer. The mechanism of action may be attributed to the production of rhythmic motor contractions that activate the endogenous opiate mechanisms of analgesia. This level of electroanalgesia is most often used in patients with deep, throbbing, or chronic pain.
Noxious-level stimulation.
By utilizing low frequency (1-5 pps) or high frequency (80-100 pps) stimuli with durations of up to 1 second and amplitudes that produce pain, noxious-level stimulation seeks to ameliorate pain through the induction of a painful stimulus either at the pain site or at a remote location. The mechanism of action is believed to be related to an endorphin-mediated mechanism accompanied by the release of endogenous opiates that increase the patient's pain threshold. This level of stimulation is not the first approach chosen for electroanalgesia due to its induction of pain.

Chiniot District

Chiniot District (Punjabi, ), became the 36th district of the Punjab province of Pakistan in February 2009. At an earlier time it was a tehsil of Jhang District.
History.
Chiniot region was agricultural region with forests during the Indus Valley Civilization. The Vedic period is characterized by Indo-Aryan culture that invaded from Central Asia and settled in Punjab region. The Kambojas, Daradas, Kaikayas, Madras, Pauravas, Yaudheyas, Malavas and Kurus invaded, settled and ruled ancient Punjab region. After overunning the Achaemenid Empire in 331 BCE, Alexander marched into present-day Punjab region with an army of 50,000. The Chiniot region was ruled by Maurya Empire, Indo-Greek kingdom, Kushan Empire, Gupta Empire, White Huns, Kushano-Hephthalites and Shahi kingdoms.
In 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin, In 1005 he conquered the Shahis in Kabul in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of Punjab region. The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region.
After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Sikh invaded and occupied Narowal District. The Muslims faced severe restrictions during the Sikh rule. The British took over Chiniot District in 1848.
The predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslim refugees from India settled in the Chiniot District.
"Chiniot" name is from Chandan Khan sister of Malik Machchhe Khan, Raja of Chiniot, a khokhar rajput clan. Mari tappa (founded raja badal khan khokhar rajput)was not then populated, but andheri was flourishing, and north of it lay the dhaular, or abode of Rani chandan, which was called chandniot, now chiniot. Or some say its name is based on as, literally "OT" (Behind/Across) of "CHIN-ab river", hence Chiniot. According to Sir Denzil Ibbetson. Panjab Castes, A glossary of tribes and caste of Punjab by H.D.ROSE.Chiniot was known for its master crafted furniture, not only in Pakistan, but all over the world. Its highly special and master craft Jharokhas are known in the whole country. Sheikh, Janjua, Sayed, Sial, Qazi, Japaa, Bala, Chadhar, Haral,Glotar, Sangha, Khokhar, Lali, Sipra, Nesoana, Rehan, wallahRai and Khundowaa tribes are leading tribes 
On 2 February 2009, Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif formally approved the creation of Chiniot as the 36th district of Punjab province on the behaf of Molana Ilyas Ahmed Chinioti. Calls for Chiniot to be made a district date back to 2005, when a movement was a launched to elevate the former tehsil to district level. The movement died down when the public were assured the next Nazim would be from Chiniot – however this was not to be the case.
Rana Tahir-the maiden DCO Chiniot along with Mr Hamza Shahbaz Sharif, raised the flag of Pakistan on DCO office on the fine morning of 1 July 2009. The efforts of Rana Tahir in giving a proper developed outlook to the infant district will find a place in history and cannot be over-emphasized. Mr Dilmeir Khan appointed as first district accounts officer and Mr Fayaz Sunbal was appointed as First DPO Chiniot.
Language.
Punjabi is the native language of majority people. Urdu is also spoken.
National ground.
Most of the villages in the district some known havily bata, Ayoub ngar, nalka ada, Chmra more. These villages were planned mostly along canal banks to distribute the population evenly. ayoub ngar is also famous for national cricket ground and famous team of national ground is ALI CC. The capton of Ali cc is ABUBAKAR ALI BATA. the team players are Saqib khan, Asad ullh bata, Raza shah, m.Ali, Nasir Ali, Qaisar, Bilal Hmza, Sna Ulah, Farooq, Usman, Mujahid.
Satellite town.
Election commission office, Sui Gas office, Post Office, Hockey Ground, Excise and taxtation office, Zakat distribution office, Deaf & Dumb School are located in Satellite Town.thatta fateh ali is the most popular village of chiniot.
Nalka Adda (Hussain Abad).
This area is situated at about 47 km away from Chiniot city and about 10 km from tehsil Bhowana and almost boundary town of Chiniot district. This area is in moza Thatta Muhammad Shah. In Hussainabad there are two private schools and one bank which is mcb bank. Hussainabad is the centre of trade for the villagers. On every Saturday, a cattle mandi take place. Hussain Abad is developing rapidly after bhowana. The honourable personality of this village is Syed Nazar Abbas who is famous for his honesty. In this moza there are several villages, which are:
1. Riazwala.
This area is about 1.5 km from Hussainabad. This is on the name of a famous saint Sakhi Haji syed Riaz Hussain, whose sharine is situated in Wara Sadaat. This area is famous for its records corps. There is one basic health centre and primary school for boys and girls separately.
2. Kandiwal.
Kandiwal is the 1st union council of the distt Chiniot. The famous folk singer Sanam Marvi is also a resident of Kandiwal.
3. Aliabad.
There is one Middle school of boys and no any English medium school in the area. This whole area is under the influence of Sardars which are the landlords. The Sardars and Landlords do not want any development for the education of local people because do not want people to be educated and often patronage the thieves.
4. Ratta Pur Bala.
It has fertile lands with small holdings. Important crops grown are wheat, rice, sugarcane, and maize. There are primary Schools for boys and girls. The entire village consists of only one caste "Balla". Most people of the village are illiterate. There are three tomb of "Olia-e-Kram". Most famous tomb is "Bava Syed Jhulan Shah". Annual Oras and Mela is continuing from Last 100 years. Malik Dilmer Khan Bala was first District accounts officer belong to this village.
5. Sheikhan City.
Adda Sheikhan is situated 44 km away from District Chiniot. It contain fertile soil mostly useful for large scale production of wheat, rice, barley, cotton, vegetables and fruits. It has become the hub of trade, commerce and education. There are primary and middle schools for boys and girls at government level but some private schools such as Jinnah cadet school, Alqamar model school and Science system school are providing quality education in enhancing people's morale. There are also two Schools of religious thought, Jamia Imam -Ul- Asr(as) and "Madrassa Qamr ul Uloom" providing people the education of Quraan -o- Hadith and Fiqh. Adda Sneikhan produces many people having high education and research in different subjects and sharing there roles in different government institutions. Many famous personalities visit this area. Annual religious processions like Ashura and Eid meelad-un-Nabi are celebrated and both Shia and Sunni participate together which shows the intra-faith unity of local people. Recently, it has become the part of Chiniot District. But Adda Sheikkhan is not provided with any development program from Chiniot District the "Chief Minister Shehbaz Shareef" announce funds for different projects so people are worry about the negligence of this area. The authorities are not taking any attention to this area in case of any development as the area containing almost 30000 population and about 45 villages are connected for livelihood, business, education and trade but there in no infrastructure for these activities. The population want the urgent release of funds for construction of Government High schools for Boys and Girls and also for sewerage system because the area has right if merit is included.
6.Moza Sarrowala. Sarrowala is situated 44 km away from District Chiniot. It contain fertile soil mostly useful for large scale production of wheat, rice. It has become the hub of trade, commerce and education. There are Primary and middle school for boys and girls at government level.
Fauna and flora.
The fauna and flora of the district include:
Jand trees (Prosopis spicigera), Karir (Capparis aphylla), Beri (Ziziphus jujuba), Van (Salvadora abeoides), Kikar (Acacia arabica), Shisham (Dalbergia ) and Aak (Calotropis hamiltoni) are found within the district.
Architecture.
The Omar Hayat Mahal (also known as Gulzar Manzil), is a 19th-century palace in Chiniot.
(Badshahi Masjid) it was built by Nawab Saad Ullah Khan. It has same architecture as Shahi Masjid Lahore. Nawab Saad Ullah was minister in the cabinet of the Mughal Empire.

The Fun Zimbabwe Ride 2009

The Fun Zimbabwe Ride 2009 was an event which took place during the first two weeks of April 2009 in Zimbabwe. It was a fund raising event for H.E.L.P. International, a children's charity with projects in Zimbabwe.
History.
This event, was the brain child of Richard Pantlin from Oxford, United Kingdom. In late 2008 Richard was looking to raise funds for charities doing work in Zimbabwe. He had already been fund raising for charities with projects in South Africa. His main method of fund raising was riding his bicycle in unusual locations.
An Internet search revealed that H.E.L.P. International, a children's charity, had projects in Zimbabwe. On enquiry richard got in touch with Asher Mupasi, a Trustee of the Charity. By coincidence, Asher was setting up an annual fund raising bicycle race in Zimbabwe by locals to encourage locals to participate in raising funds for funding child welfare projects in their area. H.E.L.P. International would be staging a 50 mile race each year. The charity was fund raising to build a much needed children's home at Chatsworth, Zimbabwe. There were already a number of children cared for in selected homes in the community, but some were HIV positive and required special attention and a children's home would be the best way to cater for their needs.
After some discussion, the two men agreed to stage fund raising bike ride within Zimbabwe itself. In early 2008, Zimbabwe was considered unusual in that there were acute shortages of almost every commordity in the country. The ride would be a challenge on many levels. A published reporton life expectancy in Zimbabwe suggested it was the lowest in the world at female life expectancy of 34 years and male life of 37 years. This suggested that both Richard and Asher should be already dead if they were living in Zimbabwe.
The international press was, at this point, awash with condemnation of the Zimbabwe government and warning visitors not to visit the country. The project had other threats such as the utbreak of Cholera, the disappearances of political individuals, the strikes by health and other staff, the absence of what might be called law and order, etc. The general advice was "Do not venture into Zimbabwe"
The announcement that the project was going ahead coincided with the arrival of the world recession and many would be contributors were affected, leaving the projected financially exposed. The organisers did not want to postpone seeing that the plight of the children was getting worse.
April 2009 was set as the date for the ride.
By Christmas 2008, people in the United Kingdom, USA, Canada, Spain, South Africa, and Zimbabwe itself had expressed interest in the project. On 26 November 2008 Richard and Asher enlisted the support of four members of Parliament, all from different parties. They also held a meeting with the Deputy Ambassador at the Zimbabwe Embassy to ask for help with equipment regarding custom duty and delays since they would not have many days in Zimbabwe.
On March 11, 2009, the Engineers at Stoke on Trent College released the ambulances ready for shipping to Zimbabwe. At this point the riders had no bikes and no idea where to get bikes. Although many enquiries had been made to bike companies, not one was willing to help.
An enquiry to Raleigh of South Africa was the first to be received positively. They recommended one of their tested products specially designed for long distance. They would also serve well as ambulance bikes. It was confirmed that they could be source in Johannesburg.
Mupasi and Pantlin then made plans to fly into South Africa instead of directly to Zimbabwe. To capture the ride on video, the following items were purchased.
The following items were donated by wellwishers for the children:
Idea.
To cycle the distance from Bulawayo to Masvingo to Harare over a reasonable period of time without any organised support, carrying all provisions, including tends, water purification, food, and other things. To be able to effectively deal with any emergencies that may arise without necessarily appealing to other than local people. While in any area, use your bike just like any local person with a bike would do, the only difference being the riders are going a bit further than a local person would go, over 600 km. Carry provisions on bicycle ambulances.
Why FUN?
As the riders ride, they meet children along the way. They hand over pencils, small toys and balloons to them and clown for them to have a laugh. That is why the word Fun was included in the name. It is fun for the children who many not have had much fun in the recent past.
Monitoring the ride.
A page to record all that happens during the ride has been set up so that everyone with Internet access can follow the progress of the riders on a daily basis. To access it during the ride from 30/03/09 visit this link [http://ride.thruhere.net/charity/fzr/] A video of some aspects of the ride will be released after the ride.
The ride itself.
The roads in Zimbabwe are not maintained and mostly do not have a hard shoulder. Drivers mostly do not observe basic road rules and seem to ignore the fact that there is a variety of vehicles on the roads, of which bicycles are one valid type. Also very few drivers observe the stipulated speed limits. If you are used to cycling on European roads, you need to have a serious attitude change before you can cycle on Zimbabwean roads. Other road users care little whether you survive or not. The riders were shouted at to get off the road a few times, also on many occasions they were physically forced off the road by waggons overtaking in obviously dangerous situations.
From Bulawayo there was a very strong head wind which slowed the riders significantly, especially in view of the fact that they were carrying all their provisions with them in GO-HOME bags. After Masvingo, there was a side wind which was a lot easier to handle and the riders were able to increase their speeds. The following is a progress chart covering the whole ride.
Bikes used: Raleigh Tourer, road tyres,
Physical threats to riders during ride.
During the planning stage, information arriving from people on the ground in Zimbabwe suggested that the roads were in severe disrepair, causing traffic to move very slowly. This was interpreted by the riders to mean safety from traffic would be high since everyone would be trying to miss potholes. However, on arrival in Zimbabwe, it soon became clear that vehicles, including heavy wagons, were moving much faster than expected, and were overtaking much more dangerously than was anticipated. For this reason, traffic became the single biggest threat to rider safety during the ride.

Hylo Brown

Hylo Brown (April 20, 1922 – January 17, 2003) was a bluegrass and country music singer, guitarist and bass player.
Biography.
Frank "Hylo" Brown, Jr. was born in River, Johnson County, Kentucky and began his career as a performer on radio station WCMI in Ashland, Kentucky in 1939. Soon, he moved to WLOG in Logan, West Virginia and their "Saturday Jamboree". Six months later, he moved with his family to Springfield, Ohio. He began composing songs and performing on local radio stations in Ohio. During an appearance at WFPB in Middletown, Ohio he received his nickname "Hylo" because Smoky Ward, who was on the show, couldn't remember his name and started calling him "Hi-Lo". That nickname was a humorous indication of Brown's presumed vocal range. In 1950, he recorded with Bradley Kincaid at WWSO studio in Springfield. Four years later, Brown wrote a song, "Lost To A Stranger", that was sent to Ken Nelson, the A & R man of Capitol Records. The song was meant to be recorded by Kitty Wells but instead, Nelson offered Brown a recording contract if he recorded it himself. On November 7, 1954, he cut his first recordings for Capitol Records. "Lost To A Stranger" became his first hit. In early 1955, he formed the "Buckskin Boys" performing on the WWVA Jamboree in Wheeling, West Virginia. In 1957, he joined Flatt & Scruggs on their "Martha White Mills" shows, and he was regularly featured in solo performances as well as with the Foggy Mountain Boys. He renamed the "Buckskin Boys" calling them "The Timberliners". The Timberliners consisted of Brown on guitar, Red Rector on mandolin, Jim Smoak on banjo, Clarence "Tater" Tate on fiddle and Joe "Flap Jack" Phillips on bass. After his Capitol contract had expired, Brown signed with Starday Records in 1961. He retired in 1991 and moved to Mechanicsburg, Ohio. Hylo Brown died on January 17, 2003. He is interred in Rose Hill Burial Park, Springfield,
Clark County, Ohio.

Later in 2011, the U.S. government forced Sonic.net and Google to turn over e-mail addresses of people who had corresponded with Wikileaks volunteer and Tor developer Jacob Appelbaum. Sonic.net and Google fought the secret court order, which CEO Dane Jasper characterized as "rather expensive, but the right thing to do," and the court agreed to lift the seal on the Sonic order to give Appelbaum a copy of it.
In 2012, Jasper told TorrentFreak that Sonic.net will not be participating in the so-called "six strikes" plan, in which major U.S. Internet service providers will begin to warn and punish people suspected of infringing copyrights, saying that ISPs are not equipped to police the actions of individuals, and that the MPAA and RIAA have not invited small, independent ISPs to participate.

<doc id="21461784" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21461784" title="Taxonomy of Anopheles">
Taxonomy of Anopheles

"Anopheles" is a genus of mosquitoes (Culicidae). Of about 484 recognised species, over 100 can transmit human malaria, but only 30–40 commonly transmit parasites of the genus "Plasmodium" that cause malaria, which affects humans in endemic areas. "Anopheles gambiae" is one of the best known, because of its predominant role in the transmission of the deadly species "Plasmodium falciparum".
Classification.
The classification of this genus began in 1901 with Theobald. Despite the passage of time, the taxonomy remains incompletely settled. Classification into species is based on morphological characteristics - wing spots, head anatomy, larval and pupal anatomy, and chromosome structure, and more recently on DNA sequences.
The genus "Anopheles" belongs to a subfamily Anophelinae with three genera: "Anopheles" Meigen (nearly worldwide distribution), "Bironella" Theobald (Australia only: 11 described species) and "Chagasia" Cruz (Neotropics: four described species). The genus "Bironella" has been divided into three subgenera: "Bironella" Theobald (two species), "Brugella" Edwards (three species) and "Neobironella" Tenorio (three species). "Bironella" appears to be the sister taxon to the "Anopheles", with "Chagasia" forming the outgroup in this subfamily.
The type species of the genus is "Anopheles maculipennis" Meigen 1818.
Subgenera.
The genus has been subdivided into seven subgenera based primarily on the number and positions of specialized setae on the gonocoxites of the male genitalia. The system of subgenera originated with the work of Christophers, who in 1915 described three subgenera: "Anopheles" (widely distributed), "Myzomyia" (later renamed "Cellia") (Old World) and "Nyssorhynchus" (Neotropical). "Nyssorhynchus" was first described as "Lavernia" by Theobald. Edwards in 1932 added the subgenus "Stethomyia" (Neotropical distribution). "Kerteszia" was also described by Edwards in 1932, but then was recognised as a subgrouping of "Nyssorhynchus". It was elevated to subgenus status by Komp in 1937; this subgenus is also found in the Neotropics. Two additional subgenera have since been recognised: "Baimaia" (Southeast Asia only) by Harbach "et al." in 2005 and "Lophopodomyia" (Neotropical) by Antunes in 1937.
One species within each subgenus has been identified as the type species of that particular subgenus:
Within the genus "Anopheles" are two main groupings, one formed by the "Cellia" and "Anopheles" subgenera and a second by "Kerteszia", "Lophopodomyia", and "Nyssorhynchus". Subgenus "Stethomyia" is an outlier with respect to these two taxa. Within the second group, "Kerteszia" and "Nyssorhynchus" appear to be sister taxa. "Cellia" appears to be more closely related to the "Kerteszia"-"Lophopodomyia"-"Nyssorhynchus" group than to "Anopheles" or "Stethomyia", tentatively suggesting the following branching order: ( "Stethomyia" ( "Anopheles" ( "Cellia" ( "Lophopodomyia" ( "Kerteszia", "Nyssorhynchus"))))).
The number of species currently recognised within the subgenera is given here in parentheses: "Anopheles" (206 species), "Baimaia" (one), "Cellia" (239), "Kerteszia" (12), "Lophopodomyia" (six), "Nyssorhynchus" (34) and "Stethomyia" (fuve).
The subgenus "Baimaia" may be elevated to genus level, as it appears to be a sister group to "Bironella" and all other "Anopheles".
The ancestors of "Drosophila" and "Anopheles" diverged . The Old and New World "Anopheles" species subsequently diverged between 80 and .
Divisions below subgenus.
Taxonomic units between subgenus and species are not currently recognised as official zoological names. In practice, a number of taxonomic levels have been introduced. The larger subgenera ("Anopheles", "Cellia", and "Nyssorhynchus") have been subdivided into sections and series, which in turn have been divided into groups and subgroups. Below subgroup but above species level is the species complex. Taxonomic levels above species complex can be distinguished on morphological grounds. Species within a species complex are either morphologically identical or extremely similar and can only be reliably separated by microscopic examination of the chromosomes or DNA sequencing. The classification continues to be revised.
The first species complex was described in 1926 when the problem of nontransmission of malaria by "Anopheles gambiae" was solved by Falleroni, who recognised that "An. gambiae" was a complex of six species, of which only four could transmit malaria. This complex has subsequently been revised to a total of seven species of which five transmit malaria.
Subgenus "Nyssorhynchus" has been divided in three sections: "Albimanus" (19 species), "Argyritarsis" (11 species) and "Myzorhynchella" (four species). The "Argyritarsis" section has been subdivided into "Albitarsis" and "Argyritarsis" groups.
The "Anopheles" group was divided by Edwards into four series: "Anopheles" (worldwide), "Myzorhynchus" (Palearctic, Oriental, Australasian and Afrotropical), "Cycloleppteron" (Neotropical) and "Lophoscelomyia" (Oriental); and two groups, "Arribalzagia" (Neotropical) and "Christya" (Afrotropical). Reid and Knight (1961) modified this classification by subdividing the subgenus "Anopheles" into two sections, "Angusticorn" and "Laticorn" and six series. The division was based on the shape of their pupal trumpets. The "Laticorn" section was created for those species with wide, funnel-shaped trumpets having the longest axis transverse to the stem, and the "Angusticorn" section for species with semitubular trumpets having the longest axis vertical more or less in line with the stem. The earlier "Arribalzagia" and "Christya" groups were considered to be series. The "Angusticorn" section includes members of the "Anopheles", "Cycloleppteron", and "Lophoscelomyia" series, and the "Laticorn" section includes the "Arribalzagia" (24 species), "Christya", and "Myzorhynchus" series.
"Cellia" is the largest subgenus: all species within this subgenus are found in the Old World. It has been divided into six series - "Cellia" (eight species), "Myzomyia" (69 species), "Neocellia" (33 species), "Neomyzomyia" (99 species), "Paramyzomyia" (six species) and "Pyretophorus" (22 species). This classification was developed by Grjebine (in 1966), Reid (in 1968) and Gillies & de Meillon (also in 1968) based on the work by Edwards in 1932. Series definition within this subgenus is based on the cibarial armature - a collection of specialized spicules borne ventrally at the posterior margin of the cibarium - which was first used as a taxonomic method by Christophers in 1933.
"Kerteszia" is a small subgenus found in South America whose larvae have specific ecological requirements; these can only delevop within water that accumulates at the base of the follicular axis of the epiphytic Bromeliaceae. Unlike the majority of mosquitoes, species in this subgenus are active during the day.
Within a number of species, separate subspecies have been identified. The diagnostic criteria and characteristic features of each subgenus are discussed on the own page.
Species complexes.
"Anopheles nuneztovari" is a species complex with at least one occurring in Colombia and Venezuela and the another occurring in the Amazon Basin. These clades appear to have diverged and expanded in the Pleistocene. 
Medical and veterinary importance.
The first demonstration that mosquitoes could act as vectors of disease was by Patrick Manson, a British physician working in China, who showed that a "Culex" species could transmit filariasis in 1878. This was then followed in 1897 by Ronald Ross, who showed avian malaria could also be transmitted by a species of "Culex". Grassi in Italy showed that the species causing human malaria were transmitted by species of the genus "Anopheles" in 1898. "Anopheles gambiae" (then "Anopheles coastalis"), the most important of the vectors transmitting human malaria, was first recognised as such in 1899 at Freetown, Sierra Leone. It was later realised that only a small number of species of mosquitoes were responsible for the vast majority of human malaria and other diseases. This generated a considerable interest in the taxonomy of this and other mosquito genera.
The species of the subgenera "Baimaia", "Lophopodomyia", and "Stethomyia" are not of medical importance.
All species within the subgenus "Anopheles" known to carry human malaria lie within either the "Myzorhynchus" or the "Anopheles" series. "Anopheles maculipennis" s.l. is a known vector of West Nile virus.
Six species in the subgenus "Kerteszia" can carry human malaria. Of these, only "An. bellator" and "An. cruzii" are of importance. "Anopheles bellator" can also transmit "Wuchereria bancrofti".
Several species of the subgenus "Nyssorhynchus" are of medical importance.
All series of the subgenus "Cellia" contain vectors of malarial protozoa and microfilariae.
Five species of anopheline mosquitoes ("An. arabiensis", "An. funestus", "An. gambiae", "An. moucheti", "An. nili") all belonging to the subgenus "Cellia" are responsible for over 95% of total malaria transmission for "Plasmodium falciparum" in continental sub-Saharan Africa.
"Anopheles sundaicus" and "An. subpictus" are important vectors of "Plasmodium vivax".
Species evolution.
The "Anopheles gambiae" complex has a number of important malaria vectors. A chromosomal study suggests that "An. merus" is the basal member of this complex and is sister species to "An. gambiae". The two species "An. quadriannulatus" A and "An. quadriannulatus" B - neither of whom are vectors for malaria - are derived from "An. gambiae".
Species listing.
Species that have been shown to be vectors of human malaria are marked with a star (*) after the name.

Maia Berzina

Maia Yanovna Berzina (, October 25, 1910, Paris—August 30, 2002) was a prominent Soviet ethnographer, geographer and cartographer (member of Soviet Geographic Society from 1954). Among her scores are "Americans" entry in the "Great Soviet Encyclopedia" (3rd ed., 1970) and several maps in the "Great Soviet World Atlas" (vol. 1 and 2). Overall she was the author of about fifty original ethnic maps.
Early years.
The father, Yan Berzin, a Lett, was arrested and shot in 1938. Mother Roza Garmiza, originally a Jewish socialist-revolutionary, was arrested in the same year and died in imprisonment. Berzina was born in immigration, in Paris and spent most of her childhood abroad, mainly in England, being fluent in English. She graduated from MSU's geographic faculty as econogeographer. She declared herself a cosmopolite, even in 1950s, when this word was discouraged in the Soviet Union. Berzina spent only few months of her childhood in Russia, finally settling in Moscow in 1927. In 1937 she married Leonid Vasilevsky, a gifted econogeographer and part time geographer.
Later work.
Berzina joined the fresh-formed Peoples Maps Group at the Ethnography Chair of MSU, where she compiled the maps of ethnic compound of Switzerland, India, United States and other countries. During the German-Soviet War, Berzina was evacuated to Tashkent, returning to Moscow in 1943. She was hired as a junior research fellow to the newly established Miklukho-Maklay Ethnography Institute of Soviet Academy of Sciences and worked there until pensioning off in 1984, being elevated to senior research fellow in 1975. In 1969 she upheld a thesis "Forming of the Ethnic Compound of Canadian Population" and published a book of the same name. Berzina was also a permanent contributor of the "Soviet Ethnography" journal, translating the journal summaries into English.

<doc id="21461831" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21461831" title="Game in hand">
Game in hand

The term game in hand is used in sport to indicate when a team has played fewer matches than other teams around them. This term is used to indicate that, whilst a team is in a particular position in a league, because they have played fewer matches than other teams around them they could potentially improve their position depending on the results in the differing games.
The term is regularly used in association football, but is also used in ice hockey, rugby league, rugby union and domestic cricket.
How games in hand occur.
A team who is successful in a cup competition, for example, may find that League games are postponed to accommodate cup matches, especially in the latter rounds of the competition. For example, in the English League Cup, the Final is played on a weekend usually in February or March. As such, because only two teams are in that final, the rest of the League fixtures usually continue as normal, with only the games involving the two finalists being postponed. Early rounds of competitions usually include most teams from the League and no League matches are played, but as the competitions progress and fewer teams are involved, League games will take place assuming that neither team remains involved in that competition.
Involvement in other domestic and non-domestic competitions can also require League games to be postponed meaning that a team could have played two or three games fewer than those around them, especially if the teams around them have been eliminated from the domestic competitions in early rounds, or are not involved in the non-domestic competitions.
Postponements can also occur for other reasons, such as a frozen or waterlogged playing surface, making that surface unplayable. These postponements are often made only a short time before the game begins and too late for alternative arrangements to be made - if such arrangements are even possible.
A game which is abandoned part way through usually has the result annulled and will require it to be replayed.
Finally, especially since the advent of sport being broadcast live on digital television, games are now spread throughout a whole weekend and are not always played on the same day. Thus a team can have played fewer games than their opponents, simply because their opponents play earlier in the weekend schedule.
How a game in hand affects the league.
The explanation below uses the points system in English League Football as an illustration. Other sports use different scoring systems, but the basic premise of a Game in Hand is the same. In English League football, teams gain 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a defeat. There is no bonus point system.
To start, assume that three teams are aiming for the top position in a League table. Their current positions are detailed in the table below:
Pld = Matches played; W = Matches won; D = Matches drawn; L = Matches lost; F = Goals for; A = Goals against; GD = Goal difference; Pts = Points
In the table above, Chelsea has one game in hand over Manchester United. Arsenal has two games in hand over United and one game in hand over Chelsea.
Should Chelsea win their game in hand they will get 3 more points and be on 69 points, which would put them above Manchester United.
Should Arsenal win both of their games in hand they will get 6 more points and be on 70 points, putting them above both United and Chelsea, irrespective of Chelsea's result in their game in hand. Thus, although United currently lead the table, they could find themselves in third place once all three teams have played the same number of games. Conversely, Arsenal, currently third, could be first once they have played the same number of games as United.
It may be felt that United being top of the table is in some way a false position, since they could be as low as third once all three teams have played the same number of games. However, games in hand are merely games that Chelsea and Arsenal have not played, and if the results go poorly for them, they will not improve their League positions at all. Should the games in hand all be drawn, the League table would see United top by one point over Chelsea and two points over Arsenal with all three teams having played 30 matches.
Disadvantages of games in hand.
Having games in hand is useful, since it means that you can improve your position in the League by winning those games. However, having games postponed for whatever reason means that they need to be rescheduled for a later date. This often involves fitting in games whenever possible causing what is known as a fixture pile-up, where numerous matches have to be played in a short period of time. Playing more games in a shorter space of time than your opponents can lead to players becoming tired and increase the risk of injuries.
Playing games in hand.
In most sports all games in hand are played before the scheduled final League matches in a season. This is so that team know for certain where they have finished in the League, without having to wait for games in hand to be completed. It is common in most sports for every team in a League to play their last League games of a season at the same time. This can lead to a team playing numerous games in hand during the preceding days and weeks to clear the backlog of games in hand.

Renaud d'Herbauges

Renaud (died 843) was Frankish Count of Herbauges, Count of Poitiers and Count of Nantes. His name is also spelled Rainaldus or Ragenold, and he is sometimes known as Reginald in English. He is referred to as Renaud of Aquitaine, but seems to have been a member of the Rorgonid family of Maine. 
The County of Herbauges consisted of three "pagi" south of the Loire: "Arballicus" (Herbauges), "Metallicus" (the Mauges), and "Teofalicus" (Tiffauges) and was separate from the County of Poitou, of which Renaud also appears to have been Count. His appointment as Count is prior to July 835 when he appears in a battle against the Normans in Noirmoutier.
Count of Nantes.
After the death of Count Ricwin of Nantes at the Battle of Fontenay (841), he was appointed by Charles the Bald as Count of Nantes. This was at the expense of Lambert II of Nantes, who had fought for Charles at Fontenay, and was considered the legitimate heir of his father, the former Count Lambert I of Nantes. Disappointed in his ambitions, Lambert II broke with Charles the Bald and turned to Nominoe, Duke of Brittany, who was then in almost open revolt against the Franks. Nominoe and Lambert intended to join forces to capture Nantes. 
Invasion of Brittany.
Having fortified Nantes, Renaud heard that Nominoe had been incapacitated by a serious illness. Renaud decided to take the initiative, by raiding into Breton territory. At the junction of the diocese of Alet and county of Nantes, on the Roman road of Angers Carhaix he surprised the Breton army led by Nominoe's son Prince Erispoe. At the Battle of Messac, Erispoe was initially defeated by Renaud. Shortly afterwards, however, the timely arrival of Lambert's troops allowed Erispoe to counter-attack in force, defeating Renaud. Renaud himself was killed the day afterwards, during the pursuit. The Bretons may also have been assisted by the Viking warlord Håstein, who is said to have personally killed Renaud. However, other sources assert that Lambert killed Renaud and that the Viking force arrived shortly afterwards, looking for plunder.
Aftermath.
The Vikings sacked Nantes and killed its bishop. Lambert occupied the town, but was unable to hold it. Renaud's son Hervé was killed in battle against Lambert a year later. Recent studies suggest that another of Renaud's sons Ragenold became Count of Herbauges, then Maine and Marquis of Neustria.

Reg Potts

Reginald "Reg" Potts (31 July 1927 – 28 January 1996) was an English football defender, nicknamed "Dan" after Desperate Dan.
A key member of Port Vale's history, he played 301 competitive games for the club between 1945 and 1957. He helped the "Valiants" to win the Third Division North title and to reach the FA Cup semi-finals in 1953–54. He later turned out for non-league sides Worcester City and Macclesfield Town.
Playing career.
Potts played for Wellington Scouts, Northwood Mission and Stoke City, before joining Port Vale in August 1945. National service interrupted his career however, and he could only be regularly picked by Vale from February 1952. He did though feature in 19 Third Division South games in 1948–49, and also played three games in 1949–50 and 25 games in 1950–51 under the stewardship of Gordon Hodgson. He scored his first senior goal on 27 March 1950, in a 2–0 win over Torquay United at The Old Recreation Ground.
Potts featured 21 times in 1951–52, as short-term boss Ivor Powell was replaced by Freddie Steele. He was an ever-present during the 1952–53 season, as the "Valiants" finished as runners-up of the Third Division North. He also managed to score a thirty-five yard lob at Vale Park in a 4–0 win over Grimsby Town on 30 April. In the 1953–54 season, the "Iron Curtain" defence of Ray King (goalkeeper), Tommy Cheadle, Potts, Stan Turner and Roy Sproson were a key part of Vale's success in winning the league and reaching the FA Cup semi-finals.
He was an ever-present in the 1954–55 season, as the club posted a 17th place finish in the Second Division. He also played every game in the 1955–56 season, as part of his 167 consecutive appearances between October 1953 and April 1957. He featured 41 times in 1956–57, as new manager Norman Low failed to prevent Vale slipping to relegation. Former teammate Graham Barnett later recalled how Potts and fellow defender Stan Turner did not get along and refused to speak to each other despite playing alongside each other for eight years. Potts was sold to Southern League side Worcester City in July 1957, later moving on to Macclesfield Town, before finishing his career coaching schoolboys.

Martha Leijonhufvud

Märta Erikdotter Leijonhufvud, (English: "Martha") known as King Märta (24 December 1520 in Ödeby Lillkyrka, Ekeberg, Närke – 15 January 1584 in Stegeholm), was a politically active Swedish noble. She was the sister of Queen Margaret Leijonhufvud and sister-in-law of King Gustav I of Sweden: she was also the maternal aunt of Queen Catherine Stenbock and the daughter-in-law of the regent Christina Gyllenstierna. In 1568, she financed the deposition of King Eric XIV of Sweden, which placed her nephew John III of Sweden on the throne.
Biography.
Marriage.
Born to Erik Abrahamsson Leijonhufvud (d. 1520), a victim of the Stockholm Bloodbath, and Ebba Eriksdotter Vasa, and relative of Gustav Vasa, who became king of Sweden in 1523.
Her sister Margaret was engaged to Svante Stensson Sture, the son of former regent Christina Gyllenstierna, but the engagement was broken in 1536 when king Gustav decided to marry her. Instead, Sture was married to Märta. There is a well known legend as to how this came about: Svante Sture threw himself at the feet of Margaret, and the king entered the room and discovered them. The king asked: "What is this?" Margaret replied: "My lord Sture is asking me for the hand of my sister Märta!", at which the king said: "Granted!"
Martha and Svante Stensson Sture was married 3 March 1538 at Nyköping Castle.
King Martha.
Märta had at least fifteen children, of which ten became adults. The couple resided in Stegeborg Castle. In 1542, Stegeborg was besieged by Nils Dacke during the Dacke War, and Dacke offered the couple to become the king and queen of Sweden. They denied the offer.
Svante was often absent on his official missions: he became marshal in 1543 and commander in Finland in 1556, and governor of Livonia and Reval in 1562. During his absence, Märta took the responsibility for Stegeborg and his estates, and her dominance earned her the nickname "King Märta", by which she is known in history.
As the sister of the queen and by marriage to the head of one of the most prestigious families in Sweden, Martha had a position of high status and participated in certain ceremonies in court life. Martha, as well as her sister Brita and her mother-in-law, often took care of the royal children. After the death of her sister the queen in 1551, the royal children was placed in the care of her and her sister Brita, after her mother-in-law Christina Gyllenstierna had asked to be relived of the duty, until the king's remarriage to the daughter of Brita, Martha's niece Catherine Stenbock.
In 1561, King Eric XIV of Sweden introduced the new title of count in Sweden at his coronation, and her husband was created one of Sweden's first three counts, making Märta the first countess in Sweden. King Eric, however, feared that the Sture family had desires on the throne, and during his reign, they also became a center of the opposition within the nobility.
The Sture murders.
Eric XIV eyed Martha and the Sture family with suspicion. The Vasa dynasty was not regarded to have the same right to the Swedish throne as did the Sture family, which had on several occasions had the position of regent of Sweden during the former century. Despite this, Martha's spouse Svante and her sons Erik and Nils was appointed to serve in the Nordic Seven Years' War (1563-1570). In 1565, her son Nils was accused of treason and forced to a humiliating entry to the capital. He was acquitted by the court, but the case created hostility among the nobility toward the king. The King therefore had Svante Sture and his sons Nils and Erik imprisoned. In August 1566, Martha's son wrote to her: "I do hope to be able to defend myself with other things than letter and seal", which hinted preparations of a conspiracy. Märta sent an appeal for mercy to Karin Månsdotter, who sent for her and assured her that no harm would come to them, and that she would speak to the king on their behalf. This made Eric hesitate temporarily, but 24 May 1567, he ordered the murder of the three men all the same. This is known as the Sture Murders. The clothes worn by Svante, Nils and Erik Sture at the time of their deaths were kept by Martha, and are now on display in Uppsala Cathedral's northern tower.
After the murders, the king regretted them: he arranged for a grand funeral for the victims, and paid Martha fines of compensation in silver bricks. When the half brothers of King Eric XIV, which were also nephews of Martha, rebelled against him in September 1568, Martha financed the deposition of the monarch which placed her nephew John III on the throne with silver. After the coup, in 1570, John III granted Martha personally the former County of her spouse as a fief, now enlarged.
Her daughter's elopement.
Her daughter, Malin (Magdalena), (1539–1610), was in love with her cousin, Erik Gustavsson Stenbock (1538–1602), and wished to marry him. Martha refused because they were cousins. In 1573, after ten years had passed without any change in the matter, Erik convinced Prince Charles to provide them with 200 men to help them elope. Erik asked Malin to take a trip on the sleigh with him, and when they were seated, the prince's guards came forward and the couple departed from the estate.
Martha convinced her royal nephew the king to arrest Erik and confiscate his property. He was eventually released and his property was restored to him, after the siblings and spouse of the king as well as his own family, among them his aunt (and Martha's niece) Queen Dowager Katarina Stenbock, had united in convincing the king to concede to it, and married Malin in 1574. According to the legend, it took one year of begging from the couple's relatives to convince Malin's powerful mother to forgive the couple for defying her authority; the women of the family begged her "crying upon their knees" before she agreed to see her daughter. According to legend, her daughter had to crawl on her knees up to her while pregnant.

<doc id="21461960" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21461960" title="Palazzo Porto">
Palazzo Porto

Palazzo Porto is a palazzo built by Andrea Palladio in Contrà Porti, Vicenza, Italy. It is one of two palaces in the city designed by Palladio for members of the Porto family (the other being Palazzo Porto in Piazza Castello). Commissioned by the noble Iseppo da Porto, just married (about 1544), this building had a rather long designing stage and a longer and troublesome realization, partially unfinished.
Since 1994 UNESCO has been included the palazzo, with other examples of palladian architecture in Vicenza, in a World Heritage Site City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto.
Historical and architectural description.
It is very probable that Iseppo (Giuseppe) Porto’s decision to undertake construction of a great palace in the Contrà (Contrada) dei Porti was taken to emulate the edifice that his brothers-in-law Adriano and Marcantonio Thiene had begun to erect, in 1542, only a stone’s throw away. It is also possible that it was Iseppo’s very marriage to Livia Thiene, in the first half of the 1540s, which provided the concrete occasion for summoning Andrea Palladio.
Allied with the Thiene, the Porto were one of the city’s rich and powerful families, and the palaces of the family’s various branches were ranked along the Contrada which today still bears their name. Iseppo was an influential personality, with various responsibilities in the public administration of the city, responsibilities which on more than one occasion were intertwined with the assignments entrusted to Palladio.
Relations between the two must very probably have been closer than between patron and architect, if we consider that thirty years after the project for Iseppo’s city palace Palladio designed and began to build a great villa for him at Molina di Malo, subsequently never completed. The two friends died in the same year, 1580.
The palace was inhabitable from December 1549, though less than half the façade was standing and would only be completed three years later, in 1552. Numerous autograph drawings by Palladio record the complex design process. They show that right from the beginning Palladio planned for two distinct, residential blocks, one to lie along the street and the other contiguous to the back wall of the courtyard. In the "Quattro libri dell'architettura" (1570) the two blocks are interconnected by a majestic courtyard with enormous Composite columns: this is quite clearly a re-elaboration of the original idea in the interests of publication.
Compared with the Palazzo Civena, only built a few years earlier, the Palazzo Porto fully illustrates the extent of Palladio’s evolution after the journey to Rome in 1541 and his acquaintance with both antique and contemporary architecture. The Bramantean model of Palazzo Caprini is here reinterpreted, with Palladio observing the Vicentine custom of living on the ground floor, which is higher as a result. The splendid, four-columned atrium represents Palladio’s reinterpretation of Vitruvian spaces, but one where traditional Vicentine typologies also survive.
The two rooms to the left of the atrium were frescoed by Paolo Veronese and Domenico Brusasorzi, while the stuccoes are by Bartolomeo Ridolfi. On the palace attic, the statues of Iseppo and his son Leonida, in antique Roman garb, keep watch over the entrance of visitors to their house.

IBM 7700 Data Acquisition System

The IBM 7700 Data Acquisition System was announced by IBM on December 2, 1963.
It was capable of collecting data from as many as 32 sources simultaneously, process the data and transmit results to up to 16 remote printers, display units or plot boards.
The IBM 7700 was short-lived, being replaced by the IBM 1800 Data Acquisition and Control System on November 30, 1964.
Two IBM 7700 Data Acquisition Systems are known to have existed: one at the University of Rochester and the other at Stanford University. Both were donated by IBM.
The IBM 7700 was an 18-bit system, with instructions occupying two 18-bit words. Arithmetic instructions generally executed in two or three machine cycles, except for multiply, about 8 cycles, and divide, 12 cycles. A machine cycle was two microseconds. Address space was 262,144 words, but the two machines known to have been built had 16,384, 32,768 or 49,152 words.
The IBM 7700 was contemporary with the IBM 7000 series but not considered a member of it.

Warty dyskeratoma

Warty dyskeratoma, also known as an Isolated dyskeratosis follicularis, is a benign epidermal proliferation with distinctive histologic findings that may mimic invasive squamous cell carcinoma and commonly manifests as an umbilicated (Having a central mark or depression resembling a navel) lesion with a keratotic plug, WD have some histopathologic similarities to viral warts but it's not caused by HPV and the majority of these lesions display overall histopathologic features consistent with a follicular adnexal neoplasm. usually limited to the head, neck, scalp or face and vulva. Lesions are generally solitary and sporadic and may be associated with a follicular unit. Oral involvement, particularly the hard palate, and genital involvement have been reported. it can also be thought of as one of the manifestations of focal acantholytic dyskeratosis, an epidermal reaction pattern that can be seen in several disorders, including Darier's disease and Grover's disease. But the main Difference between Darier disease and Warty dyskeratoma, is that Darier disease inherited dermatosis (autosomal dominant) consisting of multiple keratotic papules on the face, trunk, and extremities, while WD occurs as an isolated, noninherited, single keratotic nodule mainly confined to the head and neck as mentioned earlier.
Differential Diagnosis.
Warty dyskeratoma must be differentiated from vulvar dysplasia, bowenoid papulosis, squamous carcinoma, condyloma, and other viral-induced squamous lesions.

Alan Durst

Alan Durst (1883–1970) was a British sculptor and wood carver and member of the London Group of artists. Three of Durst's work are held in the permanent collection of Tate Gallery.
Personal life.
Alan Lydiat Durst was born at the rectory in Alverstoke, Hampshire, England on 27 June 1883. He was the son of William Durst who was the Rector of Alverstoke. He married Elizabeth Clare Amy Barlow on 11 December 1918. Durst died on 22 December 1970 and his funeral took place on Tuesday 29 December 1970 at Golders Green Crematorium.
Education.
He was educated at Marlborough College and in Switzerland.
In 1913 he enrolled at the London County Council (LCC) Central School of Arts and Crafts As part of his studies Durst visited Chartres in early 1914. He went in fact to study stained glass windows but in his private papers held at Tate Britain Archive he explained that he was so taken with the magnificence of the statuary of Chartres Cathedral that he determined to pursue sculpture as a career. As Durst puts it, seeing the Chartres statues “opened a door for me”.
Pre World War I.
Durst served in the Royal Marine Light Infantry, first joining in 1901 and details of this service are shown in record ADM/196/63 held at The National Archive. He served until 1913 when he was placed on the "Retired List" and began his studies at the School of Art.
World War I.
He returned to the Royal Marines in July 1914 and served from 1914 to 1919. In his private papers held at Tate Britain Archive Durst writes that he would often while away the time in his cabin when at sea by executing small carvings in ivory and in one of his photograph albums he features a Tea caddie with delicately carved ivory panels and adds the note "carved while at sea on active service-1918"
After World War I.
He was also recalled during the 1939-1945 conflict and in April 1921 for emergency service necessitated by the Coal Strike.
Career.
After leaving art school Durst became Curator of the George Frederic Watts Museum in Compton from 1919 to 1920. He left that museum to take up sculpture and wood carving on a full-time basis, and taught wood carving at the Royal College of Art from 1925 to 1940 and from 1945 to 1948. Durst had his first solo exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in London in 1930 and another in 1935. He was a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy. We learn from Durst's Tate Britain Archive papers that when Durst returned to his studies after the 1914-1918 war he was very much drawn to the concept of ""Direct Carving"" as advocated by Jacob Epstein and Eric Gill. He also states that he was an admirer of Henri Gaudier-Brzeska the French sculptor killed in action in 1915.
George Pace, an English architect who worked with Dunst wrote of his philosophical approach towards sculpting: 
In 1964 when he had finished carving seven statues for the upper part of Peterborough Cathedral he told me that in his early days when he wanted to learn “direct carving” he found that the art schools of the day could only teach him modelling; for it was still the fashion for sculptors to make models which were then translated into stone or marble by technicians using pointers and masons’ skills. After World War 1 the more realistic approach to sculpture enabled him to learn the techniques of direct carving and this equipped him to devote the rest of his life to spirited direct carving in stone, wood and ivory. From the summer of 1914 his life ambition was to complete a series of statues carved in the spirit he had extracted from Chartres.
He was appointed a member of The British School at Rome in 1945- Faculty of Sculpture.
