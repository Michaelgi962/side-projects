Henry Harrison (Irish politician)

Captain Henry Harrison (17 December 1867 – 20 February 1954) was an Irish politician and MP. in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and as member of the Irish Parliamentary Party represented Mid Tipperary from 1890 to 1892. He later served as an Irish regiment officer with the New British Army in World War I, was an extensive writer, and proponent of improved relations between the United Kingdom and Ireland.
Biography.
A Protestant nationalist, Harrison was the son of Henry Harrison of Holywood and Ardkeen, Co. Down and of Letitia Tennent. She was the daughter of Robert James Tennent, who had been Liberal MP for Belfast from 1847 to 1852. Later, when widowed, she married the author Hartley Withers.
Harrison went to Westminster School and then to Balliol College, Oxford. While there he developed an admiration for Charles Stewart Parnell and became secretary of the Oxford University Home Rule Group. At this time, the Land War was in progress and in 1889 Harrison went to Ireland to visit the scene of the evictions in Gweedore, Co. Donegal. He became involved in physical confrontations with the Royal Irish Constabulary and as a result became a Nationalist celebrity overnight. The following May, Parnell offered the vacant parliamentary seat of Mid-Tipperary to Harrison, who left Oxford, still aged only 22, to take it up, unopposed.
Only six months later, following the divorce case involving Katharine O'Shea, the Irish Parliamentary Party split over Parnell’s leadership. Harrison strongly supported Parnell, acted as his bodyguard and aide-de-camp, and after Parnell’s death devoted himself to the service of his widow Katharine. From her he heard a completely different version of the events surrounding the divorce case from that which had appeared in the press, and this was to form the seed of his later books.
At the general election of 1892, Harrison did not defend Mid-Tipperary. He stood at West Limerick as a Parnellite instead, but came nowhere near winning the seat. In 1895 general election, he stood at North Sligo, polling better but again far short of winning. In 1895 Harrison married Maie Byrne, an American, with whom he had a son. He came to prominence briefly again in 1903 when, in spite of his lack of legal training, he successfully conducted his own case in a court action all the way to the House of Lords.
Otherwise, however, he disappeared from public view until his war service with the Royal Irish Regiment when he served on the Western Front with distinction in the New British Army formed for the First World War, reaching the rank of Captain and being awarded the MC and bar and military OBE. He organised patrols in "No Man’s Land" so successfully that he was appointed special patrol officer to the 16th (Irish) Division. He was invalided out in 1919.
He then made a return to Irish politics, working with Sir Horace Plunkett as Secretary of the Irish Dominion League, an organisation campaigning for dominion status for Ireland within the British Empire. Harrison was a lifelong opponent of Irish partition. He was Irish correspondent of "The Economist" from 1922 to 1927 and owner-editor of "Irish Truth" from 1924 to 1927.
Harrison’s two books defending Parnell were published in 1931 and 1938. They have had a major impact on Irish historiography, leading to a more favourable view of Parnell’s role in the O’Shea affair. F. S. L. Lyons commented that he "did more than anyone else to uncover what seems to have been the true facts" about the Parnell-O'Shea liaison. The second book, "Parnell, Joseph Chamberlain and Mr Garvin", was written in response to J. L. Garvin's biography of Joseph Chamberlain, which had ignored Harrison’s first book, "Parnell Vindicated: The Lifting of the Veil". Later, Harrison successfully repulsed an attempt in the official history of "The Times" to rehabilitate that newspaper’s role in using forged letters to attack Parnell in the later 1880s. In 1952 he forced "The Times" to publish a four-page correction written by him as an appendix to the fourth volume of the history.
During the difficult years of the Anglo-Irish Trade War over the land purchase annuities, declaration of the Republic, Irish neutrality during World War II, and departure from the Commonwealth, Harrison worked to promote good relations between Britain and Ireland. He published various books and pamphlets on the issues in dispute and wrote numerous letters to "The Times". He also founded, with General Sir Hubert Gough, the Commonwealth Irish Association in 1942. By the time of his death, he was the last survivor of the Irish Parliamentary Party led by Parnell, and as a member of the pre-1918 Irish Parliamentary Party, he seems to have been outlived only by John Patrick Hayden, who died a few months after him in 1954 and by Patrick Whitty and John Lymbrick Esmonde who were only MPs for a very short time during the First World War.
He is buried in Holywood, Co Down.

Conic optimization

Conic optimization is a subfield of convex optimization that studies a class of structured convex optimization problems called conic optimization problems. A conic optimization problem consists of minimizing a convex function over the intersection of an affine subspace and a convex cone.
The class of conic optimization problems is a subclass of convex optimization problems and it includes some of the most well known classes of convex optimization problems, namely linear and semidefinite programming.
Definition.
Given a real vector space "X", a convex, real-valued function 
defined on a convex cone formula_2, and an affine subspace formula_3 defined by a set of affine constraints formula_4, a conic optimization problem is to find the point formula_5 in formula_6 for which the number formula_7 is smallest. Examples of formula_8 include the positive semidefinite matrices formula_9, the positive orthant formula_10 for formula_11, and the second-order cone formula_12. Often formula_13 is a linear function, in which case the conic optimization problem reduces to a semidefinite program, a linear program, and a second order cone program, respectively.
Duality.
Certain special cases of conic optimization problems have notable closed-form expressions of their dual problems.

Clearing (album)

Clearing is a guitar solo album by English guitarist, composer and improvisor Fred Frith. It was Frith's first solo guitar recording since "Live in Japan" (1982) and his first solo guitar studio recording since his landmark 1974 album "Guitar Solos". 
"Clearing" comprises eleven tracks of unaccompanied and improvised music played on prepared guitars by Frith. Ten of the tracks were recorded in Stuttgart, Germany in 1996 and 2000, and one was recorded live at the Konstrukcja w Procesie Festival VII in Bydgoszcz, Poland in 2000.
"AllMusic" said this of the album:
Background.
In 2000, John Zorn commissioned Frith to make a guitar solo album for Tzadik Records as a follow-up to his 1974 album, "Guitar Solos". Using prepared guitars, Frith recorded "Clearing" in Stuttgart, Germany in July 2000 in a similar vein as "Guitar Solos", revisiting areas explored on that album but not developed further at the time. He also included two additional tracks, "Gaifu Kaisei" and "This Earth is a Flower" that had been recorded earlier.
Frith used a variety of found objects when recording the album. On "Chains", Frith placed a lozenger tin on the guitar strings and dropped a chain into the tin. An acoustic sound was achieved on "Blue" by placing microphones close to the electric guitar strings. Chopsticks were jammed between the guitar strings on "Gaifu Kaisei". "Minimalism" was performed entirely by striking the guitar strings with drumsticks.
Frith dedicated four of the tracks on the album to:

<doc id="9786394" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9786394" title="Dambe">
Dambe

Dambe, also known as Kokawa is a form of boxing associated with the Hausa people of West Africa. Historically, Dambe included a wrestling component, known as Kokawa, but today it is essentially a striking art. The tradition is dominated by Hausa butcher caste groups, and over the last century evolved from clans of butchers traveling to farm villages at harvest time, integrating a fighting challenge by the outsiders into local harvest festival entertainment. It was also traditionally practised as a way for men to get ready for war, and many of the techniques and terminology allude to warfare. Today, companies of boxers travel, performing outdoor matches accompanied by ceremony and drumming, throughout the traditional Hausa homelands of northern Nigeria, southern Niger and southwestern Chad. The name "Dambe" derives from the Hausa word for "boxing", and appears in languages like Bole as Dembe. Boxers are called by the Hausa word "daæmaænga"
Techniques.
Although there are no formal weight classes, usually competitors in Dambe matches are fairly matched in size.
Matches last three rounds. There is no time-limit to these rounds. Instead, they end when: 1) there is no activity, 2) one of the participants or an official calls a halt, or 3) a participant's hand, knee, or body touches the ground. Knocking the opponent down is called killing the opponent.
The primary weapon is the strong-side fist. The strong-side fist, known as the spear, is wrapped in a piece of cloth covered by tightly knotted cord. Some boxers dip their spear in sticky resin mixed with bits of broken glass. This, however, became an illegal practice. The lead hand, called the shield, is held with the open palm facing toward the opponent. The lead hand can be used to grab or hold as required.
The lead leg is often wrapped in a chain, and the chain-wrapped leg is then used for both offense and defense. The unwrapped back leg can also be used to kick. Because wrestling used to be allowed, and the goal of the game is to cause the opponent to fall down, kicks are more common than they used to be.
Tournaments.
Traditionally, contests took place between men of butchers’ guilds who would also challenge men from their village audiences. Drawn from a specific lower caste of Hausa society who were the only ones who could ritually slaughter animals and handle meat, traveling butchers formed boxing teams from their ranks called "armies". Their bouts took place at festivals marking the end of the harvest season, as clans of butchers would travel to slaughter animals for farm communities. Harvest also marked a time when rural communities were flush with money, so gambling on feats of strength became closely associated with these celebrations.
Today, participants are as often urban youths who train in gyms or backyards, competing year-round. While no longer the preserve of the Hausa butcher caste, the cofraternity aspect remains, as youths who join the professional ranks join a professional community which travels to perform bouts in carnival like appearances, complete with amplified sound systems and elaborate pre-match ritual. Side betting for spectators and prize purses for competitors remain an important part of the event.
During village bouts, contests take place in a cleared area called the battlefield, with spectators forming the boundaries of the ring. In modern urban bouts, local competitions take place in temporary rings, often setup outside meatpacking plants as members of traditional butcher castes still predominate. In these urban matches, participants wear shorts rather than loincloths. Sand filled West African Lutte Traditionnelle arenas, common in large towns, are used for larger bouts, and are often combined with traditional wrestling championships.
Whether traditional or modern, percussive music and chants precede the bouts. The music and chants are associated with both groups and individuals, and serve to call boxers to the ring, taunt opponents, and encourage audience participation.
In traditional bouts, amulets are often used as forms of supernatural protection. Amulets are seen in modern urban bouts, too, but officials generally discourage the use of magical protection on the grounds of fairness. It is still common that amulets are placed in the feather filled pillows which fighters place in their wrapped fists, and fighters often scar their striking arm, rubbing salves and resins into the healing wounds which are meant to provide strength or defence. Some modern traveling boxing companies engage in ritual smoking of Hemp or Marijuana before bouts.
Origin theories.
The stances and single wrapped fist of Hausa boxers bear visual resemblance to illustrations of Ancient Egyptian and Hellenistic boxers. This has caused speculation that Hausa boxing is directly related to Ancient Egyptian boxing

Wallfisch was born into a family of distinguished musicians, his father the pianist Peter Wallfisch and his mother the cellist Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, who is one of the last known surviving members of the Girl orchestra of Auschwitz. It quickly became clear in Wallfisch's childhood that he would dedicate his life to the cello, and thus he was provided, from the outset, with the guidance of such teachers as Amaryllis Fleming, Amedeo Baldovino, and Derek Simpson and Gregor Piatigorsky. Today, Wallfisch is in high demand as a performer and a teacher throughout the world, and in particular, he has been appointed to the faculties of the Konservatorium Zürich Winterthur and the Musikhochschule Mainz. A prizewinner at the International Gaspar Cassadó Cello Competition in Florence, Wallfisch has made CD recordings of almost the entire cello repertoire, including works by Britten, Finzi, Kenneth Leighton, Shostakovich, Ernest Bloch, Maurice Ravel, William Busch, Robert Schumann, Alexander von Zemlinsky and Tchaikovsky.

Zavala, Texas

Zavala, Texas, is a ghost town in Jasper County, Texas (USA) from 1834 until the late 19th century. Named for empresario Lorenzo de Zavala, the town was founded on land owned by Thomas Huling along the Angelina River. The approximately 40 families who lived in the town survived by farming or logging. The town last appears on a list of communities in the county in 1878 and has since been abandoned. It is not to be confused with the city of Zavalla, which lies only 20 miles to the northwest, in Angelina County.
History.
In 1829 the Mexican government granted empresario Lorenzo de Zavala land in eastern Texas. The land grant covered an area that is now Jasper County. Thomas Huling purchased some of this land, and in 1834 founded the town of Zavala, named for the empresario, and also known as Muster Point. The town was incorporated on December 24, 1838 by the Republic of Texas, and a post office was erected in 1839.
In the 1840s, a fire destroyed much of the town, including the courthouse, many homes, and most of the town records. In 1847, Huling sold much of the town, as well as of land in Jasper County, to Englishman Jerich Durkee in exchange for $1000 and 5000 "tin boxes of Green Mountain Vegetable Ointment." Although the post office was discontinued in 1856, the town remained on a list of Jasper County communities as late as 1878. It has since been abandoned. All that remains of the town is a cemetery which includes a granite marker commemorating the town's previous existence.
Geography.
The town was located in Jasper County, Texas, approximately northwest of Jasper and north of Beaumont, and west of the Sabine River, which marks the border between Texas and Louisiana. Positioned "on a rise near the east bank of the Angelina river", Zavala lay along the Beef Trail, which ran from Texas into Louisiana. The landscape was very wooded, featuring loblolly pines, shortleaf pines, and oak trees.
Demographics.
At its peak, approximately 30–40 families lived in Zavala. Although Durkee promised to settle immigrants in the area, he was unable to attract enough families to enable the community to survive.
Economy.
Many of the town's residents were farmers. Others worked in logging. Trees would be cut and floated down the Angelina River to the Neches River, with Beaumont as their final destination. At one point in the town's history, a railroad line either went through or came very near the town.

The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) is a national agency of Government of India, with the remit to consider and recommend foreign direct investment (FDI) which does not come under the automatic route. It provides a single window clearance for proposals on FDI in India.
Members.
The Board is empowered to co-opt Secretaries to the Government of India and other top officials of financial institutions, banks and professional experts of industry and commerce, as required.
Process.
In a significant move aimed at expediting flow of foreign investment into the country, the Union Cabinet liberalised the FDI policy further by allowing the FIPB to clear proposals from overseas entities worth up to ₹12 billion, against the existing limit of ₹6 billion.
Recommendations of FIPB for proposals up to ₹12 billion are approved by Minister of Finance. While recommendations for proposals of more than ₹1200 crore need to be approved by Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA).
Aircel-Maxis deal controversy.
Former Minister of Law and Justice and 2G spectrum scam petitioner Dr Subramanian Swamy alleged that in 2006, a company controlled by then Minister of Finance P Chidambaram's son Karti got five per cent stake in Sivasankaran's Aircel to get part of ₹40 billion that the Maxis Communications paid for 74 per cent stake in Aircel. He alleged that Mr Chidambaram withheld the FIPB clearance to the deal till his son got the five per cent shares in Siva's company.
Subsequently the issue was raised on multiple times in Parliament of India by the opposition which demanded resignation of Mr P Chidambaram. He and the government denied all the allegations. According to The Pioneer and India Today reports, documents show that approval to the FDI proposal was indeed delayed about 7 months by P Chidambaram.

Alexandra Pistohlkors

Alexandra Alexandrovna Pistohlkors,(1888–1968), née Taneyeva, was the younger daughter of noted Russian composer Alexander Taneyev, sister of Anna Vyrubova, and wife of Alexander Erikovich Pistohlkors, who was the stepson of Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia.
Like her sister, Alexandra was for a time a devotee of the starets Grigori Rasputin.
Background.
Alexandra was the third and youngest child of Taneyev and his wife Nadezhda Illarionovna Tolstaya. Her nickname was Sana.
"Sana was a very nice looking woman with a little porcelain face, and she produced the charming impression of a spoiled and self-centered child," recalled the singer Alexandra Belling.
Alexandra married Alexander Pistohlkors, a former Life Guards officer who was reportedly famous for his cruelty in putting down the rebellion following the Russian Revolution of 1905. The couple had three daughters, Tatiana, Olga, and Alexandra, born in 1910, 1912, and 1914. Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia was the godmother for the eldest daughter, Tatiana.
Relationship with Rasputin.
At first the starets was a frequent visitor to the Pistohlkors in their home and Alexandra introduced Rasputin to many of her friends and relatives. Later, because Alexandra's mother-in-law, Olga, detested Rasputin, the young couple had to meet with Rasputin in her sister Anna's house, though Alexandra was a frequent visitor to Rasputin's apartment without her husband. Alexandra was one of several society women who became followers of Rasputin. She also sent him telegrams, asking for his prayers or help. Rasputin persuaded some of his female followers "that they must not confess the sin of adultery, since that would only confuse their confessors, who would not understand it."
"I am very sick. I implore you to help. Sana," Alexandra wrote in a telegram to Rasputin in 1913. In another telegram, sent in April 1916, she wrote that she was "gloomily sick at heart" and "I beg for help."
Alexandra's sister-in-law, Marianne Pistohlkors, has been implicated by some historians as one of the co-conspirators in the murder of Rasputin in December 1916.
Life following the Revolution.
Alarmed by the worsening political situation, Alexandra and Alexander Pistohlkors fled the country for Helsinki, Finland in 1916. The von Pistohlkors family had Baltic estates, among them a castle in Latvia, where they lived following the Russian Revolution. Alexandra's sister Anna Vyrubova also later emigrated to Finland, where she became a nun after the Revolution.
Their daughter Olga Ramel (1912-2011) later settled in Sweden.

Cathedral High School (Boston)

Cathedral High School is a private co-educational, college preparatory Catholic junior high and high school in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. It is located in the historic South End neighborhood, adjacent to the Cathedral of the Holy Cross, the seat of the Archdiocese of Boston.
In the tradition of Catholic education, and through a rigorous college-preparatory curriculum, high standards of personal and social behavior, community service requirements, and an array of athletic and other extra-curricular activities, Cathedral challenges and supports its students in developing not only their intellectual, but also their social, personal, and spiritual selves. Ninety-six percent of these young men and women are of color, primarily African-American, Haitian, and Latino. The school serves seventh through twelfth grade students and remains committed to graduating morally and socially responsible young men and women.
History.
Cathedral was founded in 1926 to educate the children of immigrants and first generation Americans living in and around the South End. Originally a high school, the junior high school (grades 7 and 8) opened in the fall of 2010. The school has helped to open the doors of educational opportunity to successive generations of Boston youth for eighty-six years. Cathedral provides a safe and structured learning environment for students who may find neither safety nor structure in their neighborhood or their home. 
In 2004, Board of Trustees took over governance of the school. Through the Board’s leadership and philanthropic support, Cathedral has been able to accomplish its mission. Renovations to the school’s facilities and innovations to the school’s learning environment have helped Cathedral become a competitive education choice in Boston. For the past eight years, Cathedral has had a one-hundred percent college acceptance rate. In 2011, Cathedral had the only recipient of the Gates Millennium Foundation Scholarship from a Catholic school in Massachusetts. Recent graduating classes have averaged over $3 million in collectively earned college grants and scholarships.
Financial Aid.
Tuition payments account for less than 15% of Cathedral’s $4 million annual operating budget. Ninety-five percent of the student body requires financial assistance. To sustain the school’s mission and work, Cathedral relies heavily on the Boston philanthropic community to fill the gap in educational costs for each student. Full-tuition honors scholarships are offered on a merit basis and a robust financial aid program is in place to help other families underwrite the modest tuition. Cathedral tuition is $4,550 for high school and $3,200 for the junior high school.
Athletics.
The Boys basketball team has established itself as a state basketball powerhouse by appearing in 5 Division IV State Championship games in 6 years (2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012). Cathedral won the 2007 Division IV Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association State Championship, defending their 2006 title. They came close again in 2008 but was defeated by Avon in the Sectional Finals. On March 9, 2009 the Boys basketball team won the Division IV State Championship for the 3rd time in 4 years against cross-city rival, North Cambridge Catholic by a score of 67-65. The team returned to the State Championship game again in 2010, but was defeated handily by another cross-city rival, New Mission. On March 12, 2012 Cathedral was beaten 70 - 64 by St Mary's of Lynn in the Division IV State Championship.
The Boys football team has also established itself as a state power house with back-to-back Division 4A State Super Bowl appearances and a 22-20 win in the 2012 championship game against Madison Park. Head Football Coach and Athletic Director Duane Sigbury was named Patriots Coach of the Week following the win and also Adidas Coach of the Year. Star wide receiver Kadeem Edge was selected for the All Scholastic award from the Boston Herald and was also named a Catholic Central Small All League Performer. The Catholic Central MVP was defensive lineman Mohammed Braimah, who also selected as an member of the All Globe Team and the Globe Scholastic Team. Honors for the Cathedral defense also included Sean Elad as the Catholic Central Small Defensive MVP and Derek Welcome as the Catholic Central Small Defensive Lineman of the Year.

Francis Spriggs

Francis Spriggs (d. 1725?) was a British pirate who, associated with George Lowther and Edward Low, was active in the Caribbean and the Bay of Honduras during the early 1720s.
Early career.
Although much of his early life is unknown, Francis Spriggs was first recorded serving as a quartermaster for Captain Edward Low (possibly as part of the original crew members who left the service of Captain George Lowther). However, after being given command of the recently captured the 12-gun British man of war the "Squirel" (renamed the "Delight" shortly thereafter), he and Low apparently had a falling out over the disciplining of one of the crew around Christmas 1724, resulting in Spriggs deserting Low in the night.
Spriggs & the "Delight".
After leaving Low, Spriggs and the crew began flying a black flag similar to Captain Low's and set sail for the West Indies. By January 28, 1725, he had looted a Rhode Island slaver captained by Richard Duffie. Capturing a Portuguese bark en route, they looted the ship's stores while the crew were put through "the sweats" or a "sweat", a mild form of torture in which a ring of candles is lit in a circle around the mainmast and each crewman was made to enter the circle and run around the mast while the pirates poked and jabbed at them with pen knives, forks and other weapons in a sort of gauntlet. After they had finished with the bark, the crew were put back on their ship, to which the pirates set fire.
Upon their arrival in the West Indies, Spriggs and his crew captured a sloop near St. Lucia, a Martinique merchantman, and a vessel with a cargo of logwood which they tossed into the sea after carrying away as much as they could take. In early 1724, while in New England waters, Spriggs and the "Delight" received word of the death of King George I and discussed the possibility of gaining a royal pardon within the year after sailing from Rhode Island on March 27, 1724.
Adventures in the Bay of Honduras.
By early-April, Spriggs anchored off Roatan near the Bay of Honduras, where he ordered many of the prisoners captured during the voyages to be put ashore. Many of these prisoners displayed wounds inflicted by the pirates during their captivity and were subject to forms of torture such as being forced to eat plates of candle wax. 
Refitting their ship on a nearby island west of Roatan, Spriggs and the "Delight" sailed for Saint Kitts with the intentions of encountering a Captain Moor of the "Eagle", a sloop which had earlier attacked George Lowther near Blanco. 
However, they were soon met by a French man of war and forced to flee. After their escape, they captured a schooner near Bermuda and then, as they neared Saint Kitts, they captured a sloop on July 4, 1724. During this latest capture, the crew were tortured by Spriggs and his crew hoisting prisoners as high as the main or top sails and dropping them against the deck. 
Shortly after this, a ship out of Rhode Island was captured with the pirates riding several of the horses it had been carrying out on the deck (after several accidents, however, the captives were blamed for not bringing along boots and spurs).
Return to the Bay of Honduras.
After the capture of a sloop off Port Royal, Spriggs was forced to retreat from two British men of war, the and . After their most recent escape, Spriggs captured another sloop and, on his return to the Bay of Honduras, took another ten or twelve English vessels before being chased off by a British man of war. 
Briefly staying in South Carolina, Spriggs again sailed to the Bay of Honduras where he captured sixteen more vessels before fleeing from the same British man of war he had previously encountered. He again managed to avoid capture, although he became separated by a ship in his fleet commanded by a Captain Shipton. Little is known of his later career; according to newspaper accounts, he was still active in the region and, as of April 1725, had captured several more ships. 
One newspaper account does suggest Spriggs was still active as late as 1726 when he was marooned on an island with another famous pirate, Edward Lowe. The report comes from the "Post-Boy" dated June 25, 1726. The only known original of the "Post-Boy" newspaper still in existence is owned by Eric Bjotvedt and states, in a front page report, that a sloop from the Bay of Honduras was taken by a Spanish vessel, but that later the Spaniards were captured and "...put on board the Diamond Man of War, who had taken a Pyrate, commanded by one Cooper, and had a great many Prisoners on board, and was bound to Jamaica with them ... that Lowe and Spriggs were both maroon'd, and were got among the Musketoo Indians."

Mount Yari

Outline.
Mount Yari is located in the Chūbu-Sangaku National Park. The name derives from its shape, which resembles a spear (槍 "yari") thrust into the sky. Because of its shape, it is also called the Matterhorn of Japan. Ridges and valleys reach out from this pyramid-shaped mountain in all directions. The four ridges are Higashikama (東鎌), Yarihotaka (槍穂高), Nishikama (西鎌) and Kitakama (北鎌) to the east, south, west and north, respectively. The four valleys are Yarizawa (槍沢), Hidazawa or Yaridaira (飛騨沢 or 槍平), Senjōzawa (千丈沢) and Tenjōzawa (天丈沢) to the southeast, southwest, northwest and northeast, respectively.
During the hiking season, Mount Yari is popular with mountain climbers. One of the most popular ridges is Kitakama. It became famous through its association with mountaineer , who was a model for the novel "Kokō no Hito" (孤高の人) by Jirō Nitta. The disaster of told in "Fūsetsu no Bibāgu" (風雪のビバーグ "Snowstorm Bivouac") also contributed to its fame. 
Despite the existence of variation routes, climbers stand in line for the famous routes during the summer. In the autumn of 2005, a new mountain trail was constructed going up from Hidarimata Valley (左俣谷 "Hidarimata-dani") to Mount Okumaru (奥丸山 "Okumaru-yama"). This made it possible to reach Yari-ga-take walking from Shinhodaka onsen upstream along the Hidarimata Valley following the mountain ridge of Mount Okumaru.
Two triangulation points were established at the summit. A milepost stone is fixed to the ground. As a reference point for the Geographical Survey Institute of Japan, it is of little importance and even on topographic maps, the summit of Yari-ga-take appears merely as an elevation point.
Surroundings.
There are several mountain huts in the vicinity of the mountain:
Yari-ga-take Sansō (槍ヶ岳山荘), Sesshō Hut (殺生ヒュッテ), Hut Ōyari (ヒュッテ大槍), Yarisawa Lodge (槍沢ロッジ), Yaridaira-goya (槍平小屋) and
Wasabidaira-goya (わさび平小屋). Being situated in the Japanese Alps, several prominent mountains can be reached from Mount Yari, among them:
Sugoroku-dake (双六岳), Nishi-dake (西岳), Ōgui-dake (大喰岳), Naka-dake (中岳), Minami-dake (南岳), Okumaru-yama (奥丸山).

<doc id="9786785" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9786785" title="Battle of Goito">
Battle of Goito

The Battle of Goito was fought between the Piedmontese and the Austrian army on 30 May 1848, in the course of the First Italian War of Independence. The Piedmontese army won the battle, as the Austrians were unable to break through to relieve the siege of Peschiera and prevent its surrender which happened on the day before the battle.
Background.
Having evacuated Milan after the Five Days of Milan on 22 March 1848, field marshal Radetzky regrouped his forces in the Quadrilatero, composed of the four supporting fortresses of Peschiera, Mantua, Verona and Legnago. The Piedmontese army advanced across Lombardy, brushing aside the covering forces under major general Wohlgemuth guarding the bridge over the Mincio at Goito during an engagement on 9 April 1848. The Austrians tried but failed to destroy the Goito bridge. Once across the Mincio, the Piedmontese forces fanned out towards the north and south.
On 10 April 1848, the Piedmontese army started to blockade the fortress of Peschiera, garrisoned by ca. 1,700 Austrian troops. Until the siege train arrived, the lack of siege guns hampered the effectiveness of the bombardment. Out of food after 34 days of blockade and 16 days under siege, the Austrians surrendered the fortress on 29 May 1848, just prior to the battle of Goito.
Meanwhile, Piedmontese and Austrian forces clashed in the battle of Pastrengo on 30 April 1848 on the Rivoli plateau. The first big test of arms occurred just outside Verona during the battle of Santa Lucia on 6 May 1848 where the Piedmontese army failed to defeat the Austrians. With a bloody nose, the Piedmontese army retired to the Mincio.
Unable to dislodge the Papal forces at Vicenza, field marshal Radetzky decided to concentrate his forces against the Piedmontese army. On 28 May 1848, he marched his army towards Mantua where a Tuscan Division was warily observing the fortress. While the Piedmontese army's attention was diverted by an Austrian brigade on the Rivoli plateau on 28 and 29 May 1848, field marshal Radetzky engaged and defeated the Tuscan division at the battle of Curtatone and Montanara on 29 May 1848. Many of the defeated and disillusioned Tuscan volunteers returned home, marking the end of the Tuscan division as a fighting force. Both the Piedmontese and the Austrian armies were now concentrated on the Mincio side of the Quadrilatero: the Piedmontese south of Peschiera, the Austrians in control of Mantua. Radetzky sent his troops north to relieve Peschiera.
The battle.
From Mantua, Radetzky sent his First and Reserve Corps towards Goito, while his Second Corps and the cavalry were ordered to reconnoiter towards Ceresara. The Piedmontese forces were deployed in two lines. The first line stretched from the banks of the Mincio at Goito westwards. The second line occupied heights above Goito. At around 14:00 on 30 May 1848, the cavalry vedettes of both sides established contact. Brigade Benedek leading First Corps advanced from Sacca towards Goito, coming under artillery fire from the Italian guns on the Somenzari heights at 15:30. The Austrians deployed their own artillery (12 guns and 3 rocket tubes) but were unable to break the Italian artillery superiority. Charles Albert, King of Sardinia, displayed personal bravery by exposing himself to the enemy artillery fire, gaining a scratch wound in the process.
While Brigade Benedek remained pinned before Goito, Brigades Wohlgemuth and Strassoldo advanced on his left, brushing aside the feeble opposition (which even fired on its own troops). To stem the Austrian progress, General Bava sent forward the Guards Brigade (on the right) and Aosta Brigade (on the left) at 17:00. The progress of the Guards Brigade was checked by Brigade Gyulai of the Second Corps which was in the process of linking up with the First Corps. Aosta Brigade pressured Brigade Wohlgemuth to withdraw. Brigade Benedek retired too when it was attacked by Neapolitan reinforcements. With darkness approaching at 19:00, both sides withdrew to their initial positions. Around this time, the King of Sardinia received the message about the Austrian surrender of Peschiera, ending the battle with the Italians in general jubilation.
Intense rainfall prevented all combat operations during the next day. Informed about the surrender of Peschiera and unable to overcome the Piedmontese army, field marshal Radetzky withdrew his forces on 2 June 1848. Directing his forces eastwards, Radetzky's next move resulted in the battle of Vicenza against the Papal forces on 10 June 1848. The Piedmontese lost 46 killed, 260 wounded and 55 missing in action at the battle of Goito. Austrian casualties were 2 officers and 65 men killed, general Felix Schwarzenberg and 18 officers and 311 men wounded, 2 officers captured, as well as 1 officer and 185 men missing in action.
Outcome.
The battle was a tactical draw, neither side managing to overcome the other. As the Piedmontese army retained control of the field of battle and prevented field marshal Radetzky from relieving Peschiera, the battle is considered an Italian victory. It lulled the Piedmontese command into a false dream of military parity with the Austrian army. The failure of keeping in contact with Radetzky's army allowed him to defeat his enemies in detail.

Honda XR250R

The Honda XR250R is a motorcycle manufactured by Honda Motor Co., Ltd. in Tokyo, Japan, as part of the Honda XR series. 
The XR250R is a trail bike used for on- and off-road purposes. It is a four-stroke, SOHC, 249 cc bike. It is a very reliable, capable motorcycle off-road and does exceptionally well, PARIS DAKAR being one of the known rallies the bike has done exceptionally well in. The XR250L was a heavier, street-legal version. The Latin American version of this bike, known as TORNADO, possesses a DOHC four-valve engine and gives out 23 horsepower.
The engines in both the XR250R and XR250L are identical. In the United States the L has a 3 mm smaller header pipe and a different carburetor to satisfy emissions regulations, though both carbs have a 30 mm throttle body. The engine has a four-valve head with splayed rocker arms to actuate the valves. Unusual for a single-cylinder engine, it has a two-into-one header pipe; after 1996 this became a two-into-two. Throughout its production, XR250R has weighed less than , whereas the XR250L typically weighs close to 123 kg dry. The R version is kickstart only, features a six-speed transmissions with chain final drive, and has stator ignition. For the pre-1996 models, the suspension travel was 260 mm front and rear. The XR250R is the enduro (competition) model; however, the L version is electric start, with pillion pegs, softer suspension and lower seat height. The changes between 1998 and 2005 consisted of decal updates.

John Zarnecki

John C. Zarnecki (born in Finchley, Middlesex, England) is an English space science professor and researcher. Since 2000, he has worked at the Open University, having previously been a professor and researcher at the University of Kent. He has taken part in several high profile space probe missions and is an expert on space debris, space dust and impacts. He was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 2014.
Early life.
Born and raised in Finchley, Middlesex, Zarnecki was educated at Highgate School and was interested in space exploration from an early age. In 1961, the school gave its pupils a day off to witness the first person in space, Yuri Gagarin, visiting the tomb of Karl Marx in Highgate Cemetery nearby. Zarnecki was among those who went.
Zarnecki later graduated from Queen's College, Cambridge with a physics degree before obtaining a doctorate at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory in Surrey.
Space science.
In the course of his career, Zarnecki has worked on hardware for many space missions. At first, he worked for British Aerospace and was part of the team that developed the Faint Object Camera for the Hubble Space Telescope. In 1981, he moved to the University of Kent in Canterbury and became the project manager for the Dust Impact Detection System on board the Giotto probe that visited Halley's Comet.
In 1988, Zarnecki was involved in plans to provide instrumentation for a proposed asteroid mission called Vesta, but, when this was dropped in favour of the Cassini–Huygens mission to Saturn and its moons, he and his team decided to use their expertise to design the Surface Science Package (SSP) for the Huygens probe. The probe would be released from the main spacecraft (Cassini) and descend to the surface of Saturn's largest moon Titan. The proposal was successful and, in 1990, Zarnecki was appointed as the SSP's Principal Investigator.
The next seven years were spent assembling and testing the instrument. With only 70% of necessary funds available, Zarnecki had to be creative with the resources he was assigned. He managed to persuade a group of scientists in Poland to provide part of the instrumentation for free.
One major setback came during the final stages of testing when, on 14 January 1996, the package was put through its final vibration test and its casing cracked. After some extensive redesign, the package was delivered to the European Space Agency (ESA). On 15 October 1997, Cassini-Huygens was successfully launched from Cape Canaveral.
In 2000, Zarnecki, along with the rest of the SSP team, moved to the Open University in Milton Keynes. There he became involved in the ill-fated Beagle 2 mission to Mars, lost while landing in December 2003.
On 25 December 2004, the Huygens probe separated successfully from Cassini and twenty-two days later, on 14 January 2005, it landed successfully on the surface of Titan. The SSP collected over three and a half hours of data, which, thanks to its efficient encoding, could be stored on a single floppy disk. The BBC Four television documentary "Destination Titan", first broadcast in April 2011, focused on Zarnecki and the Huygens mission from the perspective of the mission scientists.
In 2005, for his work on the Huygens probe, Zarnecki won the Sir Arthur Clarke Award for individual achievement.
Between 2007 and 2009, Zarnecki was the Directory of the Centre for Earth, Planetary, Space & Astronomical Research (CEPSAR) at the Open University. He is currently working as the team leader on the ExoMars mission, Europe's first Mars rover mission. He is also co-investigator on the PTOLEMY instrument for the Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
He was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 2014.
Personal.
Zarnecki lives in Milton Keynes and has a house in the south of France. He is a passionate supporter of Crystal Palace Football Club.

<doc id="9786934" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9786934" title="Welsh law">
Welsh law

Welsh law is the primary and secondary legislation generated by the National Assembly for Wales, according to devolved authority granted in the Government of Wales Act 2006. Each piece of Welsh legislation is known as an Act of the Assembly. The first Assembly legislation to be officially proposed was called the NHS Redress (Wales) Measure 2008. These powers have been effective since May 2007. It is the first time in almost 500 years that Wales has had its own laws, since "Cyfraith Hywel", a version of Celtic law, was abolished and replaced by English law through the Laws in Wales Acts, passed between 1535 and 1542 by King Henry VIII.
Legislative competence of the National Assembly for Wales.
Both the Government of Wales Act 1998 and the Government of Wales Act 2006 set out areas of devolved responsibility for the National Assembly for Wales (commonly known as the Welsh Assembly). The 2006 granted the Assembly legislative competence to make laws (known as Assembly Measures) in clearly defined "matters". In order to draft laws that are part of its area of responsibility, but where the powers of legislative competence have not been devolved to it, the Welsh Assembly could request these powers using a Legislative Competency Order or they can receive the transfer of power and the right to make laws through parliamentary bills. 
Each Order in Council for an area of legislation must be approved by the Secretary of State for Wales, both Houses of Parliament, and the Queen in Council in order for the Assembly to legislate in that area. Once the Queen has approved the Order, the new area of legislative competence is added to Schedule 5, Part 1 of the Government of Wales Act 2006. There is a Counsel General for Wales who oversees the approval and creation of these laws, and gives advice to the Welsh Government.
The 2006 Act also included provisions which would allow for a referendum to be held on whether to grant the Assembly legislative competence to pass primary legislation to be known as "Acts of the Assembly" in all matters within 20 subject areas without the need for further Legislative Competency Orders. A referendum under these provisions was held in March 2011 and resulted in a vote in favour of granting the assembly the competence to pass the Acts of the Assembly. Therefore the Assembly now has the legislative competence to pass Acts of the Assembly in all 20 devolved subjects. 
Following the devolution of legislative competence to the Welsh Assembly in some area of responsibility, it is unlikely that the UK Parliament would draw up legislation in that area without a Legislative Consent Motion being passed by the Welsh Assembly to allow them to do so (Assembly Standing Order 26). This is done to preserve the autonomy of the Welsh Assembly, and to prevent legislative confusion.
Areas to legislate: The devolved areas.
These areas are "subjects" where the National Assembly for Wales can make legislation in the form of an Act of the Assembly.
The Assembly can also legislate in areas that affect only the Assembly itself, which is why the National Assembly for Wales field is added.
Referendum to make Acts of the Assembly.
The Welsh Assembly was able to make only Assembly Measures, but the Assembly was given the option to call for a referendum, with added approval from the UK Parliament, to make Acts of the Assembly. This would not change much of the Assembly Measures system, and if the referendum should win, the Assembly Measures passed before that date would still be in force. It was considered that Assembly Measures are a build on to the Acts of the Assembly if the Assembly would these powers in future.
The referendum was held on 3 March 2011. The majority of the participants voted 'Yes' to the question "Do you want the Assembly now to be able to make laws on all matters in the 20 subject areas it has powers for?".
Even so, future Welsh order in council laws may face veto from the UK Parliament, but the Assembly still is able to make laws in areas already devolved because once the referendum is approved, there are powers that are already in the government of Wales Act 2006 to make laws already approved by parliament when the act was passed. The Assembly can still request to make laws in areas using the Order in Council system but if the UK Parliament wants to legislate in a devolved area, it will require a motion to be passed by the Welsh Assembly, similar to the way the Scottish Parliament work at present. The power to make Acts of the Assembly are called Subjects, which are listed in schedule 7, part 1 of the Government of Wales Act 2006.
English law and contemporary Welsh law.
English law still apply to Wales under the present devolution settlement. Contemporary Welsh law will govern the local aspects of Welsh life whilst English law will govern the more generic aspects. Because these laws are derived from UK Acts of Parliament, some people consider this new system of laws to be another branch of English law. Unlike Scotland, for example, which has its own criminal and civil justice system, Wales still has a unified justice system with England. The 'One Wales' Labour/Plaid Cymru deal also has an area for devolution of a Criminal and Youth Justice System to this new legal system.
It is important to note, that English law still applies in Wales, but it will also be important to say that some laws in England, that are devolved in Wales, may not apply in Wales. It is also possible to say that once the Assembly has legislative competency in an area to legislate using Acts of the Assembly, the National Assembly could lead Wales down a different route compared to English law. It's possible to say that there could be some acts that would be illegal in Wales, but not illegal in England and Scotland. For example, using an electric shock collar on a cat or dog in Wales is illegal, but it's still legal in the rest of the UK.
Wales-only laws.
There are Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament that are classed as "Wales-only laws". Each Act contains provisions for the Welsh Assembly to make subordinate legislation on. Sometimes such Acts can also confer power to the National Assembly for Wales. An example of such a Wales-only law is the Transport (Wales) Act 2006. This Act allows the National Assembly to make Orders to enforce the provisions in the Act. The Act does not confer power to the Assembly to make Assembly Measures.
A major difference is also the use of the Welsh language, as laws concerning it apply in Wales and not in England. The Welsh Language Act 1993 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which put the Welsh language on an equal footing with the English language in Wales with regard to the public sector. Welsh can also be spoken in Welsh courts.
Wales as a jurisdiction.
As there is no criminal law within contemporary Welsh law, Wales cannot be considered a fourth jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. This is because the judiciary and the courts follow England and Wales law, which is made by the United Kingdom Parliament, and is not specific to Wales. Although Welsh law is recognised as separate in operation, this is not sufficient for Wales to constitute a separate legal jurisdiction. If the One Wales agreement is successful, before 2011, this may change, as the agreement calls for a review of criminal justice matters in Wales, and the question of whether it should be devolved to Wales; currently, however, there is no devolution of justice to the Assembly.

Last Summer at Bluefish Cove

Last Summer at Bluefish Cove is a play by Jane Chambers. It is important in lesbian theater history as the first mainstream quality literary piece of its kind.
It is the story of a dissatisfied straight woman who leaves her husband to spend some quiet time by herself and who unwittingly and naively wanders into the midst of a group of seven lesbians at the beginning of their annual beachside vacation. She falls in love with the charming leading character who, unknown to her, is dying of cancer. The friendships, the laughter, the love, the fears of being outed, the difficulties of being gay and how it affects relationships with family, children, parents and careers, the demonstrations of what the painful price could be for a gay life 30 years ago in everyday America, had never before been told with such respect. Chambers' comedic dialogue, sensitivity to human nature and tender treatment of her characters help the play transcend preconceptions and show the universality of these women's journeys, whether straight or gay.
Production history.
Originally produced by The Glines (John Glines), artistic director and Lawrence Lane, managing director, "Last Summer at Bluefish Cove" opened at the Actors Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, New York City, December 22, 1980 and closed March 1, 1981 after 80 performances. Cast: Jean Smart as 'Lil', Susan Slavin as 'Eva', Janet Sarno as 'Dr. Kitty', Holly Barron as 'Annie', Dulcie Arnold as 'Rita', Lauren Craig as 'Rae', Celia Howard as 'Sue' and Robin Mary Paris as 'Donna'. Other credits include Director: Nyla Lyon, Set Design: Reagan Cook, Lighting Design: Jeffrey Schissler, Costume Design: Giva R. Taylor.
In Judy Miller's 1981 Los Angeles production, Jean Smart reprised the role of 'Lil", also featuring Lee Garlington, Camilla Carr and 5 other outstanding actresses. The production opened at the 99-seat Fountain Theater in 1981, running for 2.5 years, 4 nights a week to sold-out audiences. The production, its ensemble and Jean Smart won numerous awards during the run. These include the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for Jean Smart for Best Actress, as well as a nomination for Best Ensemble Performance. The production won seven Hollywood Drama-Logue Awards - Production, Direction, Writing (Jane Chambers), Ensemble, Lighting, Sets and Costumes, as well as Robby Awards and Oscar Wilde Awards for all the same 7 categories, and numerous GLAAD awards. The production also received a Certificate of Outstanding Theatre from the City of Los Angeles. Jean Smart was discovered at the LA Production by the casting director for Designing Women, leading to her starring role on that successful TV series.
In 1983 Judy Miller produced "Bluefish" at the 750-seat Theater on the Square in San Francisco featuring Susan Sullivan as Lil, under Marshall W. Mason's direction, for which it received numerous awards.
The play has been performed for the past 30 years across the globe, in hundreds of college and regional productions, often to sold-out audiences.
Characters.
Lil- the main character. Lil was a girl scout, and occasionally swears on scout's honor whenever she is lying. It is gradually revealed throughout the play that Lil is suffering from severe cancer, and that this will most likely be her last summer. She has already undergone chemotherapy and had several organs removed, including her ovaries, uterus, and tubes. Because of this, she is faced with her own mortality, and is crushed by her lack of a legacy. Her family disowned her following her coming out. In prior summers, Lil has had affairs with most of the other women in the cove, and has maintained a deep friendship with all them, though never experiences true love, until she meets Eva.
Kitty- Kitty is a feminist writer and former doctor, by the end of the play she decides to reopen her practice. Despite being a feminist, she has not come out and is terrified of what her homosexuality would do to her reputation as a writer. She is involved with Rita.
Rita- Kitty's lover and secretary.
Sue- a wealthy blueblood, involved with Donna. She is self-conscious about her age and appearance, and the difference in age between herself and Donna (she is 40 while Donna is only 20).
Donna- involved with Sue. Donna is spoiled, Sue claims that its her fault. Some of the character remark that Donna is a gold digger, but their love seems to be mutual and dependant on one another.
Rae- Rae is a housewife-type, and embarrassed that she enjoys cooking and cleaning, which is considered anti-feminist by Kitty. Involved with Annie.
Annie- the spunky one, involved with Rae.
Eva- Eva comes to the cove following her divorce with her husband, not aware that it is a lesbian colony. Lil is immediately attracted to her, but not understanding the nature of the cove, passes her off as friendly. Eventually, she comes out as a lesbian, and begins a relationship with Lil.
Plot.
Act One starts with Lil and Eva meeting on the coast of the cove. Lil is immediately attracted to Eva, but Eva, not recognizing her flirts, simply assumes she is being friendly. Lil, not realizing that Eva is straight, invites her to a party later that night. Upon Lil realizing that Eva is not a lesbian, she is mortified, and tries to gently uninvite her from the party. But Eva still doesn't take the hints.
Most of the characters are horrified that a straight women is not only attending the party, but living in the cove. Kitty especially is terrified of what her homosexuality will do to her career. Lil convinces them to pretend they are all straight, at least for the party. When Eva arrives, they stumble through awkward dialogue until Donna and Sue arrive. Not aware of the misunderstanding, they exclaim that they are lesbians, and that everyone at the cove is a lesbian. All the characters are embarrassed by the situation, with Eva abruptly leaving. Later that night, she returns to Lil and realizes her attraction. They begin their affair, with Lil concealing her cancer from her.
Act Two jumps to midsummer. The severity of Lil's cancer is revealed to the audience as well as Eva, after she collapses suddenly in agonizing pain. She refuses to undergo further chemotherapy, or have any other organs removed, accepting that this is her time. She is crushed that for the first time she feels true love (to Eva), and that her time is so close. Eva promises to spend the rest of Lil's time by her side.
The last scene in the play shows the remaining characters mourning Lil's death. Kitty decides to reopen her practice, Eva plays with the idea of renting Lil's cabin next summer. Of all the characters, Eva grows the most, becoming a strong, independent woman, rather than the scared dependent person she started the play as. The last lines of dialogue are meant to emphasize this:
Annie: You need a hand?
Eva: No thanks, Annie, I can make it by myself.

Fred Marriott

Fred Marriott (31 December 1872, Needham, Massachusetts - 28 April 1956) was an American race car driver. In 1906, he set the world land speed record at 127.659 mph (205.5 km/h) at the Daytona Beach Road Course, while driving the Stanley Steamer. This garnered him the Dewar Trophy in the process.
He attempted to break his record at Daytona in 1907 using an improved version of the car but hit a rut at an estimated speed of 140-150 mph. The car sailed in the air, breaking in half upon impact: Marriott was injured and did not make another attempt to break the record after he recovered.
Marriott's mark for the steam land speed record, which had become the longest-standing such record, was finally broken more than 100 years later in August 2009 when Charles Burnett III of the British "Inspiration" team recorded an average speed of 139.843 mph (225.06 km/h) at Edwards Air Force Base in California.

Pasola

Pasola is a game played by the Western Sumbanese to celebrate the rice planting season. 
The game is played by throwing wooden spears to the opponent while riding a horse. The game is played by two different groups of men from different clans or tribes. It is a game that requires a high skill at horse riding and spear throwing skill.
It ends up in a bloody game when the wooden spear hit the bare flesh of the participant. In the Sumbanese ancient beliefs, the spilled blood will fertilize the land and multiply the output of the paddy. Religiously speaking, the ritual battle of Pasola, is "essentially a fertility rite. Like the cock-fight, it is designed to shed blood on the earth" Likewise the people of Sumba, within their religious traditions are "believers of the spirits of nature and their ancestors" as are the people of Nias and the Toraja of Sulawesi.
In the Wanukaka region, as part of the ritual, early in the morning the marapu priests and their entourage go the beach to perform a prayer. They sacrifice a black cock to the gods and check the heart of the cock to read the signs from the gods on whether to proceed with the pasola as they attempt to gain the answer to their question by this ritual of divination. 
They descend to the sea afterwards to collect the colorful sea worm as part of the ritual, then proceed to the area where the game will be played.

Bill Tung

Bill Tung Biu () (March 30, 1933 in Hong Kong — February 22, 2006) was a Hong Kong actor and horse racing commentator. Tung started off as a horse jockey with his family racing horse stable. He was then recruited to become a horse racing commentator. Due to his fame, he was invited to act in many movies from 1949 to 1996, many of them with Jackie Chan during the 1980s and 1990s. Some of his famous roles includes playing Inspector Bill Wong in "Police Story", and playing a wizard in "Ghostly Vixen". His final movie before his retirement was playing 'Uncle' Bill Wong in "" in 1996. Tung retired from horse racing commentating in 2000. Tung died in 2006 of lung failure.
Biography.
Tung was born in Hong Kong in 1933. He started to learn horse riding when he was eight years old. He became an official horse jockey when he was twelve after graduating from the first post war Hong Kong Jockey Club training. In his short horse jockey career, he went to Singapore, United Kingdom and other countries as a professional horse jockey. After learning to be a horse trainer, Tung served in his family's stables as vice-horse trainers.
In 1967, when Rediffusion Television (now Asia Television Limited) began broadcasting horse racing, Tung was recruited to become a horse racing commentator. Due to his frank assessment and criticism in the horse racing circles, he was respectfully called "Uncle Biu". Due to the loss of broadcasting rights, Tung was not able to continue as a commentator on television and he joined the Hong Kong Jockey Club as a radio show host. It had an effect on the radio industry as the listenership for Radio Television Hong Kong increased significantly.
After 1997, when Hong Kong Television lost the broadcasting rights, Tung went to the Macau Jockey Club as a horse trainer. In his first year as a trainer, Tung won 64 races with the horses from his stables. He also worked as a horse racing commentator in Macau until 2000. He returned to Hong Kong as a horse racing commentator for the 2003–04 horse racing season.
In July 2005, Tung retired from the media industry due to heart disease. He had been hospitalized several times due to diabetes and heart diseases. On February 16, 2006, Tung was admitted to St. Paul's Hospital on Hong Kong Island due to physical discomfort. On February 22, 11pm, due to pulmonary fibrosis leading to organ failure, Tung died in the hospital in the company of loved ones, at the age of 73. 
A funeral committee was set up and Tung's wake was held on March 13, 2006, 4 pm at the Hong Kong Coliseum. Actor and good friend Jackie Chan was one of the pall-bearers. In the afternoon of the next day, Tung was cremated at Sha Tin's crematorium.
In his four marriages, Tung had five children. His three daughters are now married. Both of his sons have passed away, one at a young age, and his second of cancer.

Lovale people

Balovale means the Lovale people, also spelled "Luvale" and also called (in Angola) the "Luena" or "Lwena", an ethnic group in Zambia and Angola. In Zambia they are found mainly in the North-Western Province of Zambia, centred in the town of Zambezi which was previously called "Balovale". Some Zambian Luvale have left their ancestral lands for economic reasons and can be found in other locations in Zambia such as Lakanga Swamp. There is also considerable Rural-Urban migration to Lusaka. In Angola they reside in eastern Moxico Province.
The Lovale people are not united under one paramount chief but are composed of a number of subgroups speaking the Lovale language or dialects of it. The Luvale language (sometimes called Lwena) is a west central Bantu language, and a tonal language. The Lovale are closely related to the Chokwe who ended the Lunda Kingdom, and Chokwe and Lunda people also live in the same area. Within Zambia the Luvale are famous for their traditional beliefs in witchcraft or voodoo which are still commonly practised, in both rural and urban areas. The Lovale people together with the Chokwe, Luchazi and Mbunda are famous for the Makishi dancers who perform a masquerade in intricate masks and costumes.
The Zambian Makishi Festival.
In Zambia the Luvale people hold the 'Makishi festival' to mark the end of the 'kumukanda' (or 'initiation'). Every 5 years or so, boys from the same age group (young teenagers) are taken into the bush for 1–2 months where they undergo several rites of passage into manhood. These involve learning certain survival skills, learning about women and how to be a good husband, learning about fatherhood, and also they are circumcised. The Luvale consider uncircumcised men to be dirty or unhygienic. It is said that in some very rural areas where the kumukanda is maintained in its strictest traditional sense that if a woman is to pass by the boy's 'bushcamp' whilst they are undergoing kumukanda then she must be punished, even killed. To celebrate the boys' completion of the kumukanda the Makishi festival welcomes them back to the village as men. The night before men from the village take their masks to the graveyard and sleep there, allowing the spirits of their ancestors to enter them. The following evening they appear in the village with their masks. Although the other members of the community know roughly who is taking part, they do not know who is under which mask. The masks represent specific characters: Pwebo (a female character... 'pwebo' meaning 'woman' in Luvale) and Chizaluke amongst others.
In fiction.
In the Swedish 1997 murder mystery novel "Faceless Killers", Inspector Kurt Wallander investigates a murderous racist attack on a refugee center in Skane and finds it difficult to communicate with a witness who speaks only the Luvale language. The problem is resolved when a 90-year old former woman missionary is found, who speaks Luvale fluently and acts as the interpreter.

Susan George (political scientist)

Susan George (born June 29, 1934) is a well-known Franco-American political and social scientist, activist and writer on global social justice, Third World poverty, underdevelopment and debt. She is a fellow and president of the board of the Transnational Institute in Amsterdam. She is a fierce critic of the present policies of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank (IBRD) and what she calls their 'maldevelopment model'. She similarly criticizes the structural reform policies of the Washington Consensus on Third World development. She is of U.S. birth but now resides in France, and has dual citizenship since 1994.
Personal life.
Born Susan Vance Akers on June 29, 1934 in Akron, Ohio. She was the only child of Edith and Walter Akers, Episcopalians whose families had been in America for many generations; her ancestors arrived in Massachusetts in 1632. Her father was an insurance broker, and her mother was a homemaker and a member of the Junior League.
Born during the Great Depression, she was raised in a privileged environment; she had a nursemaid and took dance classes, music lessons, and, at a YMCA, swimming lessons.
After attending a public, co-educational primary school, she went on to enroll at all-girls private preparatory academy. She stated that single-sex schooling "made me not a feminist. It was normal that women do whatever anybody did. Women were the sports experts. Women were the brains. You weren't in competition with men. You weren't expected to shut up--on the contrary! Even in my era, I never felt that I was particularly put down as a woman ever."
George's father encouraged all her interests, including those outside the realm of traditional femininity, such as science and baseball. When Walter Akers went to serve in World War II, his daughter assisted in planting a victory garden.
As a young student, George was a voracious reader and always ranked first in her class. Around the age of 12, she began to develop a strong passion for the culture, language, and people of France. As a teenager she chose to attend Smith College, in Northampton, Massachusetts, specifically in order to participate in the junior-year- abroad program in France. In Paris during the 1954-55 academic year, she took courses at Sciences Po, a school specializing in social sciences. During that time, at the age of 20, she met a successful French lawyer, Charles-Henry George, 12 years her senior. In 1956 she married George and made France her permanent residence, but she did not obtain French citizenship until 1994. Quoted about her early years in France she said she felt homesick "for my women friends, probably, but not for America, per se. I'd made my choice." The couple soon started a family. Once her three children were in school full-time, George attended the Sorbonne, obtaining the French equivalent of a bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1967.
In 2002 Charles-Henry George died at their country home in France. Susan has three children—Valerie, Michel, and Stephanie—and is a grandmother. 
In an interview she states: "Either we achieve together a new level of human emancipation, and do so in a way that preserves the earth, or we shall leave behind us the worst future for our children that capitalism and nature can deal them. No one knows in which direction the balance will tip nor does anyone know which actions, which writings, which alliances may achieve the critical mass that leads us one way or another, backwards or forwards. I am acutely conscious of the precariousness of our moment and my four much-loved grandchildren give me added resolve to address it."
Career.
Throughout her career, George has been an antiwar activist as well as criticising what she saw as acts of corporate greed. At a time when women were not often allowed places of power in any organizational hierarchy, George established herself as a leader in the antihunger movement.
She became a political activist in response to France's war in Algeria and U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The Vietnam War "was this sort of gateway to understanding what America could be, which is to say something quite negative, which I had not understood at all when I lived there. I had accepted the usual propaganda."
In 1967 she joined the Paris-American Committee to Stop War (PACS). In 1973 PACS was forcibly dismantled by the French government. She then collaborated with the directors of the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, D.C., to form a new NGO devoted to social justice. The Transnational Institute (TNI) opened its doors in Amsterdam, the Netherlands that same year; George remains a fellow at TNI and also serves as its board chair.
She became assistant to the director of an NGO, the American Centre for Students and Artists, in 1969. This sparked the interest of the CIA who had already been looking into P.A.C.S.
In 1971 she began working with the Front Solidarite Indochine, a group that organized antiwar lectures and protests in France. During this time she started public speaking.
In 1974 she attended the World Food Conference in Rome, Italy where she felt that corporate agribusiness representatives dominated the proceedings.
In 1976 her first book was published: "How the Other Half Dies: The Real Reasons for World Hunger".
In 1984 she had an active role in organizing the World Food Assembly, a meeting held in Rome, Italy.
From 1990 to 1995 she served on the board of conservation group Greenpeace International, as well as that of Greenpeace France.
She opposed the OECD's proposed Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) in the 1990s, and the ill-fated "Millennium Round" objectives of the World Trade Organization at Seattle in 1999.
From 1999 to 2006 she was vice-president of ATTAC France (Association for Taxation of (financial) Transactions to Aid Citizens) and remains a member of the scientific council. She was awarded the title of honorary president in 2008.
In 1999 she also participated in the Helsinki Process.
In 2004 she supported John Kerry for president. She canvassed for Kerry in Pennsylvania, but wrote for OpenDemocracy.org (November 3, 2004), "we all thought had a very good chance, even though everyone admitted it was hard to get really enthusiastic about him... The man isn't the most charismatic ever to walk the earth. But at least he's not a proto-fascist or a go-it-aloner, and that's what we seem--apart from a last-minute miracle--to be stuck with now. With four years clear ahead of him and no re-election to worry about, I fear Bush and the ghastly neo- con/neo-liberals around him will now go on the rampage. They can continue with impunity their attacks on the Constitution and on hard-won freedoms..."
2006: attends Table of Free Voices conference, held in Berlin, Germany, in September
2008: appeared in the documentary film, The End of Poverty?
Susan George is president of the Board of the Transnational Institute in Amsterdam.
Susan George is also a Patron of the international development charity, Tools for Self Reliance.
She is on the advisory board of CEO, the Corporate Europe Observatory.
She has acted as a consultant to various United Nations specialised agencies and is a frequent public speaker, particularly for ATTAC groups, trade unions, and environment/development non-governmental organisations in many countries.

International Journal of Speleology

The International Journal of Speleology is since 1978 the official peer-reviewed scientific journal of the "Union Internationale de Spéléologie". Since 1981 it has been published by the Società Speleologica Italiana.
The "International Journal of Speleology" is divided into four sections: Botany-Microbiology, Zoology, Geology-Geomorphology, and Abstract-News. The first issue was edited by G. Claus (USA), subsequently two other editors were added: R. Husson (France) and G Nicholas (USA). The first two volumes were published by the J. Kramer Verlag (Germany), followed by Swets & ZEITLINGER N.V. (The Netherlands).
In 1972 R. Husson became editor in chief and nine volumes were issued in the period 1964 to 1977 until the cost of printing requested a radical change. In 1978 the journal became the official journal of the Union Internationale de Spéléologie and it was published in Italy where the cost of printing was lower.
In 1981 V. Sbordoni (Italy) became editor in chief. In the meantime the Società Speleologica Italiana acquired the property of the journal which was printed with a contribution of the Italian Ministry for Culture and Environment, the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, and the University of Trieste.
In the second half of the 1990s the Museo di Speleologia "V. Rivera" also contributed to the financial support of the journal. The issues of the journal were alternatively dedicated to biospeleology and physical speleology until 1998 when the journal was split into two different series: "A" for Biospeleology (which ceased publication in 2003) and "B" for Physical Speleology.
In addition to the regular issues of the journal, in 1996 a "Manual for Karst water analysis" by W.E. Krawczyk was printed.

Wyld's Great Globe

Wyld's Great Globe (also known as Wyld's Globe or Wyld's Monster Globe) was an attraction situated in London's Leicester Square between 1851 and 1862, constructed by James Wyld (1812–1887), a distinguished mapmaker and former Member of Parliament for Bodmin.
At the centre of a purpose-built hall was a giant globe, in diameter. The globe was hollow and contained a staircase and elevated platforms which members of the public could climb in order to view the surface of the earth on its interior surface, which was modelled in plaster of Paris, complete with mountain ranges and rivers all to scale. "Punch" described the attraction as "a geographical globule which the mind can take in at one swallow." In the surrounding galleries were displays of Wyld's maps, globes and surveying equipment.
Wyld originally proposed that the globe should be constructed at the Great Exhibition, but its size and Wyld's desire to run it as a promotional venture precluded it from being featured inside the Crystal Palace, so Wyld negotiated with the owners of the gardens of Leicester Square, and after much wrangling secured an agreement to site it there for ten years. The exhibition hall and model of the Earth were hastily constructed to coincide with the Great Exhibition.
In its first year the Great Globe was a resounding success, with visitor numbers second only to those of the Great Exhibition, but from 1852 onwards public interest in the attraction slowly waned. Though the novelty of a concave globe continued to win accolades for Wyld, he was faced with competition from other educational attractions, and had to adapt the entertainments on offer in order to maintain visitor numbers. Wyld held topical exhibitions and gave lectures on current events, and attempted to transfer ownership of the attraction to the "Cosmos Institute" to establish a national geographic and ethnological museum. In 1862, when Wyld's agreement for the use of the land expired, the exhibition hall was removed and the globe broken up and sold for scrap. The complicated ownership of Leicester Square gardens, combined with Wyld's failure to honour his agreement to restore the gardens after the removal of the exhibition building, led to extensive legal wrangling and questions in Parliament. Wyld finally sold his interests in the gardens, and in 1874 they were donated to the City of London.
Although there were other proposals for giant globes, and a few were constructed, it was not until 1935 that a large concave globe was recreated in the form of Chester Lindsay Churchill's Mapparium at the Mary Baker Eddy Library.
James Wyld.
James Wyld was a noted geographer and map-seller. He was the eldest son of James Wyld the Elder (1790–1836) and Eliza (née Legg). In 1838, he married Anne, the daughter of John Hester, and had two children, one of whom, James John Cooper Wyld also became a map publisher.
On his father's death in 1836, Wyld became the sole owner of the thriving family mapmaking business based in Charing Cross. His maps, which covered regions as diverse as London and the gold fields of California, were regarded highly, and Wyld himself had an excellent reputation as a mapmaker; he was elected as a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1839, and he was appointed Geographer to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert (as had been his father before him).
He had an opportunistic approach to the business and was a prolific publisher of maps and guides (so much so that "Punch" claimed that if a country were discovered in the interior of the earth Wyld would produce a map of it "as soon as it is discovered, if not before"), but his projects were not always successful; although he profited from the "Railway Mania" of the later 1830s, he became entangled in a number of court cases with unsuccessful railway companies as a result, and he overreached himself by printing maps and guides of the London rail network which included stations and connections that were planned but subsequently not built. He helped start both the Association of Surveyors and the Surveyors' Institution to lobby against the Ordnance Survey, as he felt its activities threatened his business, but when these associations failed, he pragmatically got his company appointed as one of the six official outlets for the new OS maps. He had an account at the Royal British Bank, which collapsed in 1856, wiping out the savings of many of the depositors, but the extent of his losses is not recorded.
He was also the Liberal MP for Bodmin, though his political career was on hiatus for much of the time that he managed the Great Globe. On his first election in 1848 there were charges of bribery at the polling stations, although it was decided that these accusations could not be substantiated, and he was allowed to take up his seat. His idea for the Great Globe had been many years in the formulation: a correspondent of "Notes and Queries" mentioned that as early as 1839, Wyld had broached the subject of a concave globe at a meeting to discuss an earlier giant globe project.
Site.
Wyld had approached the organizing committee of the Great Exhibition with a plan to erect a giant globe within the exhibition hall. Although he presented it as an educational attraction, Wyld's ulterior motive was to use the globe to promote his map-making business. The size of the proposed exhibit and the organizers' decision that no commercial enterprises should use the exhibition as a platform to sell their goods or services led to the rejection of Wyld's plan. Undaunted, Wyld began to search for an alternate location for his project; the reason later given for not building within the Crystal Palace was purely the lack of space rather than any rejection by the organising committee of the commercial aspect of the project. An article in "The Builder" on 30 November 1850 mentioned that negotiations were already underway to secure the gardens of Leicester Square. Described in Charles Dickens' "Household Words" as a "howling desert", the gardens were at that time an insalubrious area, "with broken railings, a receptacle for dead cats and every kind of abomination" and a meeting place for "ne'er well-to-do youths". Leicester Square had been Prince Albert's initial choice as a site for the Great Exhibition building, but the site was quickly dismissed as too small.
Wyld made an agreement with the owner of the gardens, Pheobe Moxhay, to acquire the freehold for £3,000, but the Tulk family, who owned the buildings on three sides of the square and already had a judgement against Moxhay's late husband, would have been able to prevent Wyld building. They used this hold over him to negotiate a favourable deal for themselves: they would allow Wyld to use the land for ten years from 25 April 1851, after which he would remove any buildings that he had erected within six months, and each branch of the Tulk family would have a one-year option to buy half the land for £500. Although Wyld and the Tulks attempted to negotiate with the owner of the buildings on the north side of the square, Henry Webb, they were not able to reach an agreement, and they eventually signed the contract without his assent. When Wyld began to prepare the site, Webb announced his intention to take out an injunction to prevent the building work proceeding. Wyld restarted negotiations with Webb and eventually (in July 1851, over a month after the building had been completed) Webb agreed to allow the ten-year agreement with the Tulks to stand.
Wyld obviously still felt insecure about his claim on the land and, although he was not an MP himself between 1852 and 1857, over the years a number of bills surfaced in Parliament aimed at either establishing the title to the gardens in his favour or confirming the validity of the erection of the globe building. It appears that Wyld initially intended to seek public funding for the construction but after an estimate of the costs he considered it was unlikely that he would be able to secure reimbursement and decided instead on a purely commercial venture.
Construction.
Planning.
Through an advertisement in "The Builder", Wyld contracted Edward Welch as the architect for the project. Welch submitted his first set of plans in January 1851. These plans included the construction of four theatres which Wyld planned to rent out to recoup his expenses, but there was vigorous opposition from the residents of the square, and when Wyld put the plans out to tender, the cheapest quote – from George Myers – was £2,561. Welch negotiated this down to £1,888, but Wyld informed Welch that he considered the price prohibitive. As he was embroiled in negotiations with Henry Webb at the same time, Wyld decided that he would have to settle for something less ambitious and to "give up a great part of the original design of the building".
He showed Welch's initial designs to the architect H.R. Abraham who considered that they were impractical. Wyld was worried about Welch's ability to meet his deadlines and asked him to pass any plans to Abraham for approval.
On 4 February, Wyld met with the residents of Leicester Square to present his plans for the gardens. At this meeting he claimed that in addition to the £3,000 he had paid for the freehold he had also agreed to pay £4,500 for the building and the works would cost £12,000; he would have to spend around £21,800 on the project in total, which included the outlay for new gardens and a new enclosure railing. After much discussion and receiving various assurances from Wyld that he would restore the gardens when the building was removed, the residents' committee approved his plan.
On 24 February, Wyld asked Welch to retire from the project, promising that he would be paid for the work he had done so far. Wyld then contracted Abraham to produce new plans. Abraham's designs included a new supporting wall for the globe itself (correcting what he saw as Welch's error of leaving the trusses unsupported), as well as buildings to cover the whole area of the gardens which Wyld would be able to rent out to recoup some of his costs. Despite what he had told the residents' committee, Wyld had set a budget of £2,000 for the entire building work and so could not afford the outlying buildings. Abraham's designs – minus the additional buildings, but with a circular Moorish corridor designed by G.A. Jermyn – got the final go-ahead on 15 March 1851, even though the new bids for the contract were substantially higher than they had been for Welch's original plans. George Myers' firm was again the cheapest at £2,755 and he was contracted to continue with the work. Both Welch and Abraham were eventually forced to sue to get their fees.
Building work.
Though the design of the building was not finalized until mid-March, building work had commenced immediately upon the conclusion of the agreement with the Tulks (Wyld did not actually complete the purchase of the land from Moxhay until April). Before the globe could be erected it was necessary to remove the equestrian statue of George I by C. Burchard that had been erected in the centre of the gardens by Frederick, Prince of Wales in 1747 (perhaps to annoy his father George II, who had in turn been on poor terms with his father). Details of the statue's treatment are unclear; for the most part it was reported that it was lowered into a specially constructed pit that was located beneath the building when it was erected, but there were also stories that it was sawn up and buried or that Irish workers had dismantled it and taken pieces for themselves. A question was raised in Parliament as to the fate of the statue (mistakenly identified as George II) and, when questioned, Wyld – who by his own admission spent little time on site because he was "absorbed with model" – replied that when it was examined it was found to be only lead packed with clay and thrown away with "other rubbish". In 1862 when the globe building was demolished, the horse's body was found lying on its side, and the head was reported to have been found wrapped in sacking.
Work progressed quickly. Wyld directed the project, but day-to-day site management was mostly left to Myers and Horatio Miller, an acquaintance of Wyld's who had taken an interest in the project. Miller was also later involved in a court case against Wyld, claiming that he had not been paid fairly for his work; the court found in Wyld's favour. Under the management of Myers, 300 builders raced to complete the building. The production of the casts which would form the internal surface of the globe was already well-advanced as Wyld had been working on them in a workshop in St Pancras since at least late October 1850. The project was not without its problems however. Although he had been contemplating the idea for many years, Wyld quickly realised once work was underway that the project called not just for money but for inventiveness; there were setbacks in the design and manufacture of the globe that "demanded an amount of labour and a degree of application, anxiety, and responsibility, of the extent of which no adequate estimate could be formed".
The Great Globe was not the first project of its kind: a small hollow globe was completed in 1664 for Frederick III, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, and the Georama built by C. F. P. Delanglard in Paris in the 1820s had been on similar lines to Wyld's project – a large globe with the earth represented on the interior surface and a pair of spiral staircases from which visitors could view the attraction. The Georama had been smaller and of a simpler construction though, using material and paper draped over an iron frame, and the methods employed there would not have been applicable to Wyld's larger, more robust version.
The construction difficulties and minor accidents (a shed used by the labourers burned down on 18 May though nobody was injured) delayed the project slightly, but construction continued day and night and as the building rapidly took shape it attracted almost as much attention as the raising of the Crystal Palace. On 29 May, Wyld held a preview for the press and invited guests, and on 2 June 1851, one month after the Great Exhibition started, the Great Globe was ready to open its doors to the public. Abraham's design, although described as having "no pretension", did not meet with universal approval: for some who remembered Leicester Square as the home of artists Hogarth and Reynolds, the "bastard Byzantine architecture" was "hideous" and out of place. The residents of the square were less than pleased with the brick building as Wyld had led them to believe the globe would be housed in a Crystal Palace-like construction of glass and ironwork.
The project had cost substantially more than Wyld's budget. In the cases of "Miller v Wyld" and "Abraham v Wyld", he claimed to have set aside £2,000 for the building work, but the estimated final cost was about £5,500, and would have run closer to £13,000 if Wyld had not cancelled the proposed outlying buildings. Abraham opined that Wyld's constant suggestions for (mostly impractical) alterations to the design added to both the cost and duration of the building works. In "Household Words", Henry Morley estimated that the cost of producing the model was £20,000 rather than the £13,000 Wyld had quoted to the residents' meeting, or the £4,000 to £5,000 originally estimated.
The Great Globe.
The building, which was reminiscent of the Coliseum in Regent's Park, was entered through the newly laid out gardens via one of four loggias facing north (the main entrance), south, east and west, which opened into a large vestibule paved with "patent lava" and from there through turnstiles into Jermyn's circular corridor. This corridor was hung with examples of Wyld's maps and there were examples of his guides and globes on display tables. The corridor was decorated with blue arabesques and lit by globe-shaped lamps with crimson tassels hung from ornate beams. The internal pillars were painted in a rich brown and decorated with copies of Moorish architectural designs from the Alhambra in Granada. The inner wall of this corridor was comprised in part by the rendered exterior surface of the Globe itself; the portion visible from within the corridor was painted blue with the positions of the stars in the night sky picked out in silver. The value of the star map as an educational tool was diminished as only a little of the convex face of the Globe was visible above the supporting wall and much of that was obscured by the numerous beams and supports criss-crossing the interior of the corridor.
"The Architect" criticised the internal decoration, much of which was by the theatrical scenery designer William Roxby Beverley, for being too restrained. Besides the circular corridor, Jermyn also designed a Moorish gate for the approach to the Globe's entrance. Four large galleries were later built between the loggias to surround the internal corridor and there was a refreshment stand to service the queues waiting to enter the globe. The building was about square and the external walls about high. The domed roof was originally specified in zinc, but Wyld insisted on it being made in lead, which had added to the cost and complexity of the build. Wyld complained that the building had not been finished to a high standard: there were cracks in the plaster and brickwork, leaks from rain, and there were complaints about the smell from the blocked drains almost as soon as the attraction opened to the public.
The external diameter of the globe itself was . The frame was formed by 32 large wooden trusses which were in turn supported by a brick enclosure rendered externally in cement. Between the trusses were smaller horizontal ribs from which zinc bands supported plaster casts of the features of the earth created from clay originals. There were about 6,000 of these plaster casts, each about square and thick. These castings had proved particularly problematic – not only did they have to butt together perfectly but they also had to have a tiny curvature to fit to the concave interior of the shell – Wyld had needed three attempts to perfect the design. The production procedure was also time-consuming: the appropriate scale section of the Earth's surface would first be traced out on paper, then transferred to clay modelled with the appropriate topography, from which a mould would be taken; the mould was then tried and any corrections made before a final cast was produced and passed to the painters for decoration.
By day the globe was illuminated by the light from the glass set into the dome directly above it and by night with gas lighting. Visitors entered the globe through an opening into the Pacific Ocean, then ascended through a series of four platforms. At each stage they could see a different portion of the world represented on the concave interior face of the globe. The platform scaffolding was built up from the conveniently desolate Southern Ocean; Antarctica was largely unknown at the time – Wyld dismissed stories of the existence of a great Southern continent:
The representation of the Earth's surface was to a scale of 10 miles to the inch (about 6.4 kilometres to the centimetre) in the horizontal plane, but to allow the details of mountain ranges and great craters to be easily observed the altitude scale was ten times that of the surface plane (at one mile to the inch). As the "British Quarterly Review" remarked in an article on the problems of accurately representing the Earth's features, Wyld would have had to construct a globe with three times the diameter to unify the scales. The depiction of the earth concentrated on physical geography; there were no country names or borders shown. Fertile land was picked out in green and deserts shown in a sandy yellow. The minute detail was less than carefully observed; Wyld aimed for a broad stroke to capture the imagination rather than the accuracy of the Ordnance Survey. Active volcanoes were picked out with a fiery red with cotton wool smoke, and snowy mountains with white crystal that sparkled in the gas light. The "Almanack of the Fine Arts" for 1852 felt that the globe could "scarcely be deemed a work of art", but praised some of the fine tinting work.
Attraction.
The globe was immediately popular; Wyld was a skilful self-promoter and the influx of visitors to London for the Great Exhibition helped in no small part. Figures from the Royal Commissioners showed that admittances to public exhibitions surged in 1851, with some attractions having almost a tenfold increase in visitors; during the five and half months it was open, the Great Exhibition was visited by more than 6 million people. In the first few weeks of the Globe's operation it was seen by an array of "distinguished personages", including Prince Albert (to whom Wyld had dedicated the project), Lord Castlereagh, the Duke of Wellington, the Austrian Ambassador and the King of Belgium.
Visitor numbers for the first two years are not recorded, but around 1.2 million visitors were estimated to have been admitted in 1853 (about 400,000 of these were let in for free). A guide to the attractions of London published to complement the Great Exhibition, "Tallis's Illustrated London; in Commemoration of the Great Exhibition of All Nations in 1851. Forming a Complete Guide to The British Metropolis and its Environs" by John Tallis included an entry for Wyld's Globe complete with an illustration – a magnanimous gesture on Tallis' part considering that he was one of Wyld's competitors – and most reviews of the Great Globe were complimentary. In 1851, only the Crystal Palace received more visitors. Wyld's Globe was said to be a "admirable pendant to the Great Exhibition". The globe was open from 10am to 10pm every day except Sundays. Admission cost one shilling, but on Thursdays and Saturdays this rose to two shillings and sixpence. School parties were admitted for half price.
Wyld produced a book to accompany the exhibition: "Notes to Accompany Mr. Wyld's Model of the Earth, Leicester Square", a didactic tome which imparted the wealth of Wyld's geographic and historical knowledge while extolling the virtues of London, Britain, and the Empire and which doubled up as a sales catalogue for Wyld's maps at every opportunity.
With the end of the Great Exhibition, Wyld faced a drop in visitor numbers; in an attempt to maintain the popularity of the attraction, he began to expand his half-hourly lectures on the Earth to include popular themes of the day. Although the Globe was still turning a profit, Wyld proposed divesting himself of the enterprise, by selling the land and building to the "Cosmos Institute" which would add further buildings alongside the Globe to create a national geographic and ethnological museum on the site. Wyld offered to sell the building and land (figures of £20,000–£25,000 were reported as the asking price in "The Observer"), and to raise the capital for the purchase and the proposed additional building work the Institute issued 50,000 shares of £1. Plans were drawn up by the architect Stephen Geary for the new additions and for the enhancements to the Globe itself; the Institute calculated that the attraction would turn a profit of £4,000 per annum. The issue of the ownership of the land and Wyld's right to sell was a stumbling block though, and the scheme eventually came to nothing despite a bill proposed in Parliament to establish the Institute's title to the land, and the support of "a number of noble, learned, and reverend names" among them several bishops, the naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt, the archaeologist Sir Austen Henry Layard, and the hydrographer Sir Francis Beaufort.
In 1853, Wyld arranged with the prospector John Calvert to exhibit a collection of gold nuggets and precious stones discovered in Australia. The "gold" was later discovered to be gilded lead casts. Wyld started a court case against Calvert claiming that he had been deceived, but Calvert told the jury that Wyld had always known that the genuine nuggets would not be displayed, had overseen the preparation of the casts and had even planned to drum up ticket sales with an elaborate publicity campaign based around a faked robbery, a charge that Wyld vehemently denied, stating that "no one but one who had been the associate of convicts for fifteen years would have ventured to suggest such a question" (a none-too-subtle reference to Calvert's time spent in Australia). The jury in the case was unable to reach a verdict, and while opinions differed on whether Wyld had been duped, it was clear that with topical exhibitions he had found a way to reinvigorate the attraction.
Wyld put on exhibitions on any subject that was in the public eye; among the most successful were an "Oriental Museum" which recreated scenes from life in Turkey, Armenia and Albania with dressed rooms and life-size models (and curiously also featured a model of Stonehenge), and a room dedicated to the Crimean War which featured dioramas by the theatrical scene painter Charles Marshall, and later a scale raised-relief map of Sevastopol featuring model armies which was updated daily to show the troop movements. When a large collection of captured Russian weaponry and uniforms was added in 1855 this exhibit attracted greater attention and was visited by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.
Among the more outlandish attractions were an Arctic exhibition featuring stuffed polar bears alongside a "living native of the Arctic regions", and the "Earthmen", a pair of pygmies from a tribe of Southern Africa that according to one hyperbolic advertisement "burrowed under the earth ... subsisting on insects and reptiles", but more reasonably were said to shelter in caves and hollows. Lectures on the exhibits and current events such as the Crimean War or the construction of the Panama Canal were held at regular intervals and "guides to knowledge" were positioned in the various galleries to assist and inform the visiting public.
Competition, closure and demolition.
Although Wyld undoubtedly recouped his investment within the first year of opening, over the remaining nine years of its existence the appeal of the Great Globe slowly waned. The attraction continued to draw crowds, but it was never as successful as in 1851 when the Great Exhibition had pulled visitors into the capital. By the mid-1850s the building was looking shabby and Wyld had been forced to start using it as venue for variety shows. Competition came from Burford's Panorama in the north of the square which ran topical shows just as Wyld did – Burford ran a panorama show of Sevastopol at the same time as Wyld was exhibiting his model. Burford's Panorama was the oldest of its type in London, having been established in 1790, but there were many similar attractions in the capital, among them the Diorama and the Cyclorama in Regent's Park, the panoramas of "London by Day" and "Paris by Night" at the Colosseum, the dioramas at the Gallery of Illustration in Regent Street, and the Panorama of Paris and Versailles in the Linwood Gallery in Leicester Square.
The Panopticon of Science and Art, constructed in the square in 1854, also had an impact on visitor numbers. The Panopticon was constructed by a consortium hoping to take advantage of the market for scientific and cultural attractions, but like the Great Globe it struggled to draw sufficient visitors. After two years the Panopticon closed down; it reopened shortly afterwards with the addition of a circus ring, but still proved to be uneconomical and quickly closed again. Renamed the Alhambra, it reopened as a theatre and music-hall in which form it endured until the 20th century.
In 1854, the Great Globe was enough in the public eye to inspire an entertainment by James Robinson Planché at the Haymarket: "Mr Buckstone's Voyage Round the Globe", but by 1862, there was little question of it continuing to operate even if the Tulks had not been keen to exercise their option to buy. In 1861 in "The Adventures of Philip", Thackeray noted that he had heard that the Globe was "coming to an end". The agreement with the Tulks expired in April 1862, and in the same month, Henry Webb threatened legal action because of Wyld's failure to remove the building and restore the gardens. Wyld was somewhat hamstrung as he had sold the building to William Wilde, the proprietor of the Alhambra, but Wilde had failed to pay and it took two court cases before Wyld regained possession in August. He immediately sold it to a contractor for demolition. In October the building was torn down and the globe itself broken up and sold for scrap. By November the site was completely cleared.
Disposal.
Wyld's deal with the Tulks had included a promise to restore the gardens, but he showed no signs of making good on the agreement. Stripped of the buildings, the gardens quickly reverted to their former dilapidated state. Even before the globe was dismantled, the building and gardens had deteriorated to such a degree that, speaking in Parliament in July 1861, Lord Overstone commented that "in addition to the unsightliness of the structure that had been created in the centre, and the accumulation of everything that was filthy, unseemly, and improper which existed in the enclosure, scenes took place there at a late hour which were most discreditable to the Metropolis". The statue of George I was dug up and re-erected, but it had suffered from its ten years underground. The rider may have already been stolen and sold for scrap, and the horse quickly became a target for vandalism; the legs were removed and body was painted with black and white spots.
John Augustus Tulk, who had exercised his right to buy half the gardens, was keen to build on the land and proposed creating a covered market to encompass the square and the buildings he owned around it, but the judgement the Tulks had earlier won against Moxhay proved troublesome because it stipulated that the space must be kept as either a garden or a pleasure garden. Popular feeling was that the gardens should be preserved as an open space, and the bill put before Parliament for the establishment of "Regent Market" was rejected. Tulk attempted to sell his interest in the gardens to a speculator, J. L. Tabberner, but the long negotiations fell through when Tabberner's plans for the garden were rejected and he realized that the other half of the gardens were still owned by Wyld.
In January 1865, the Metropolitan Board of Works attempted to seize the gardens under the Town Gardens Protection Act 1863 in order to carry out remedial works. Despite the bill having been proposed precisely for the case of Leicester Square gardens, the attempted seizure was found to be unlawful, and the Board failed to get the decision reversed on appeal.
There were seven descendants of the other branch of the Tulk family that each had been entitled to buy a seventh share of Wyld's remaining half of the garden, and, although the option had expired in 1862, in August 1868 Wyld disposed of his share to them for £1,000. In 1869, Webb, not realising that Wyld had divested himself of his share, attempted to get an injunction to force Tulk and Wyld to restore the gardens, but his request was not granted. The fate of the gardens was finally resolved in 1874 when MP Albert Grant bought the square for £11,060, had it redesigned and donated it to the City of London.
Legacy.
Though there was little immediate interest in reviving Wyld's idea, the concept of a giant globe was not altogether forgotten. A slightly smaller convex globe, with a diameter of , featured at the Paris Exposition of 1889. Ideas for a gigantic globe at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 were unrealistic – one was for an assembly hall for ten to fifteen thousand people inside a globe supported on the shoulders of a giant, and another was for a globe so large that a lift would be needed to reach the equator and a journey on a specially constructed spiral railway required to reach the North Pole.
In 1897, the geographer Thomas Ruddiman Johnston proposed building another giant globe in London. His plan was for a more conventional convex representation of the Earth's topography which visitors could admire from a spiral walkway that would encircle the globe. On a scale of about 8 miles to the inch (roughly 5.2 kilometres to the centimetre), his globe would have been in diameter (almost larger than Wyld's). Although Ruddiman Johnston got as far as preparing some of the sections, the proposal ultimately came to nothing.
Élisée Reclus proposed building an even larger version for the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris, and plans for the construction were well advanced before the idea was scrapped. Reclus' Great Globe was to be in diameter and feature a 1/500,000 scale globe, a planetarium and a panorama of human evolution. The Cosmorama, an only slightly less ambitious project "was" built for the Exposition. The Cosmorama, which was located near the foot of the Eiffel Tower, featured a Celestial Sphere.
Paul Reclus, Élisée's nephew, worked with Sir Patrick Geddes on a globe project for the Outlook Tower in Edinburgh, but none of Geddes' ambitious plans were realised; Reclus produced a small model of what was called "The Hollow Globe" – a projection of what the earth would look like if it were transparent and viewed from the vantage point of the tower itself – and Geddes created a concave paper celestial sphere which a single person could enter.
It was not until 1935 that anything resembling Wyld's Globe was recreated. In 1930 Chester Lindsay Churchill was commissioned to design a new headquarters for the Christian Science Publishing Society. Within his design Churchill included the Mapparium, a giant ball with a concave projection of the earth made up of 608 glass panels and spanned internally by a glass bridge. The Mapparium opened in July 1935 and by October of the same year had received 50,000 visitors.

Roeland Wiesnekker

Roeland Wiesnekker (pron. 'Roo-Land') (b. 25 November 1967 near Zürich) is a Swiss actor in movies and theater plays.
Life.
Wiesnekker grew up in a music-loving family and tried out various instruments. Despite that, he wanted to become an actor, because he adored Charlie Chaplin. In the age of 15, Wiesnekker began doing an education as a cook, but that couldn’t satisfy him, because of the “hierarchic structures”. One of his hobbies were sports, so he planned to become a sports teacher in the age of 16, but cancelled this plans and started working in a hospital. Soon he noted, that this job as a male nurse wasn’t the right thing for him. He began working in a "" (literally “alleyway-kitchen” - a soup kitchen for the homeless and those people, who are addicted to drugs.), a job that coined him deeply. Then he finally decided to become an actor.
From 1986 to 1989, he frequented the ' (a drama school) in Zürich. Even before he received the diploma, he was engaged by the theater Schauspielhaus Bochum, Germany. In 1990, he was nominated for the award ' (German new blood actor of the year). Wiesnekker went back to Zürich – despite offers of possible roles abroad. In Zürich he participated in very different productions e.g. in "Der Menschenfeind" at the Schauspielhaus Zürich. 
He was already familiar with film acting in 1989, having played a role in short film "Karl" and afterwards e.g. in the "Eurocops" series (1991) with Barbara Rudnik (Director: Markus Imboden). Beginning in summer 2003, he was part of Swiss sitcom "Lüthi und Blanc". In 2005, Wisenekker has got the "" (Swiss film award for the best main role) for his role of drug addict policeman Herbert Strähl in "Strähl". Frow then on, Wiesnekker was able to select his roles himself, even abroad (He speaks German, Swiss-German, Dutch, English and French). He likes to learn his lines in fully occupied beer taverns.
He chooses his roles intuitively, they don’t have to be big, but have to contain complex characters, a good book and a good director.

Connie Eaves

Connie Jean Eaves, FRSC (née Constance Halperin; born 1944), Director and co-founder with Allen C Eaves of Terry Fox Laboratory (Vancouver, Canada), is internationally recognized for her pioneering research in basic blood stem cell biology, which led to a breakthrough in treatment for leukemia. She is one of the world leaders in the field of hematopoietic stem cell biology. Her major contributions are the development of stem cell assays, the molecular regulation of stem cell fate decisions, and studies of leukemogensis. She also has an interest in studies in progenitor and stem cells in normal and malignant breast tissue. Her recent independent discovery of breast stem cells has been a breakthrough understanding in the field of breast cancer. 
Currently she is researching the unique properties of normal and cancerous stem cells in a variety of tissues, believed to be key in the development of definitive anti-cancer treatments, for breast cancer as well as leukemia.
Education.
Eaves received a BA in Biology and Chemistry and a MSc in Biology (Genetics) from Queen's University in 1964 and 1966. She then pursued doctoral training under the supervision of Dr. Laszlo Lajtha - one of the founders of modern hematology - at the Paterson Laboratories of the Christie Hospital and Holt Radium Institute and obtained a PhD from the University of Manchester in Great Britain in 1969. 
After an additional year of post-doctoral work in radiobiology at the same lab, she returned to Canada to undertake further post-doctoral studies at the Ontario Cancer Institute in Toronto where she worked with Dr. James Till and Dr. Ernest McCulloch from 1970-73.
Career.
In 1973 she was recruited to the British Columbia Cancer Institute (now the BC Cancer Agency) as its second full-time scientist and National Cancer Institute of Canada Scholar to help develop the preclinical pius-meson radiobiology research program. At the same time she was appointed Assistant Professor in the Department of Medical Genetics at the University of British Columbia. In 1980 she became a co-founder of the Terry Fox Laboratory at the BC Cancer Agency and was appointed its Deputy Director in 1986. She became its Director in 2006. In 2008, she was also appointed Vice President Research of the BC Cancer Agency.
Throughout her training and subsequent productive scientific career she has received numerous awards and scholarships. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1993 and, in 2003, she received the prestigious Robert L. Noble Prize for Excellence in Cancer Research from the National Cancer Institute of Canada. In 2008 she was awarded the Donald Metcalf Lecture Award by the International Society for Experimental Hematology.
Her PhD studies provided the first evidence that two distinct cell populations contribute to the generation of antibody responses, heralding the discovery soon thereafter of B and T lymphocytes. This seminal work was published in Nature in 1967. As a postdoctoral fellow, Eaves' studies contributed to the definition of the earliest stages of the red blood cell differentiation process. Her initial work as an independent investigator followed from this, laying the groundwork for the concept of a hierarchy of progenitor classes within different lineages in the blood-forming system, whose members can be distinguished by evolving biological properties and different regulatory mechanisms. She is widely recognized as a world authority on the stem cells of the blood-forming system and their regulation in both normal and perturbed states, with a particular emphasis on chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Since the early 1990s she has extended her contributions in understanding stem cell behaviour to normal and malignant breast cells.
Over the last 25 years Eaves has played a major role in the recruitment and education of many talented undergraduate and graduate students as well as post-doctoral fellows, particularly those with a clinical background, and has directly supervised more than 50 trainees at the post-graduate level. Many of these individuals have since become internationally recognized scientists in their own right in Canada, the U.S. and Europe. She remains particularly interested in the training of young investigators and continues to lead a dynamic research group at the Terry Fox Laboratory, with a publication record of more than 340 full papers including peer-reviewed articles, conference proceedings and book chapters.
Eaves has also devoted much energy to the successful development of collaborative research programs locally, nationally and internationally. She is currently involved in such activities within Genome BC, the Stem Cell Network (a Canadian NCE Program for which she served as the Associate Scientific Director for 4 years), a still active NCIC Program Project (started under her leadership in 1981) and an NIH-funded Program Project in Gene Therapy, now in its 10th year, that links investigators in Vancouver, New York, Boston and Chicago.
From 1996-99 she served an elected 3-year term as a Councillor of the American Society of Hematology and from 2000-2003 she was the elected Vice President, President-Elect and President of the International Society for Experimental Hematology. She continues to offer her services to grants panels, committees, NIH study sections and site review teams, reviews many papers each year for a variety of leading journals and has been an Associate Editor and/or member of the Editorial Board of leading journals in hematology and stem cell biology.
Eaves is an active member of numerous national and international scientific societies and has held senior executive offices in the American Society of Hematology and the International Society for Experimental Hematology. She was one of the first Co-Chairs of the Canadian Breast Cancer Research Initiative and later served as President of the National Cancer Institute of Canada (1996–98). Dr. Eaves is a member of several editorial boards and the Associate Editor of Blood as well as the Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation.
Personal life.
Eaves is the mother of 4 children - all of whom are university graduates now developing successful careers in business, politics and academia. Besides her work and her family, her passions are music, art and gardening.

Ann Jellicoe

Patricia Ann Jellicoe (born 15 July 1927) is a British playwright, theatre director and actress. Although her work has covered many areas of theatre and film, she is best known for "pushing the envelope" of the stage play, devising new forms which challenge and delight unconventional audiences. As a result her dramatic career is, in many ways, unique in the twentieth century.
Biography.
Jellicoe was born in Middlesbrough, Yorkshire in England in 1927 and from childhood showed an interest and an aptitude for the theatre. She attended Polam Hall School and Queen Margaret's School, York and studied performing arts at the Central School of Speech and Drama. This was followed by experience in repertory and fringe theatre.
In 1949 she was commissioned to undertake an investigative study into the relationship between acting and theatre architecture; the finding of this study led her to the Open stage. Jellicoe established a Sunday Theatre Club (Cockpit Theatre Club) where she produced and directed a number of plays exploring the possibilities of this form of Open stage theatre, including a one-act of her own.
Thereafter, Jellicoe used many of her plays to further explore her innovative ideas on theatre. In 1956 "The Observer" set-up a playwright’s competition to find new talent. Jellico submitted "The Sport of My Mad Mother", which won a prize in the competition. In writing this play Jellicoe applied many of the ideas she had learnt in her early years at Central School. The play was subsequently staged by the Royal Court Theatre and directed by George Devine and Jellicoe. Although originally a commercial failure, the play was later performed all over the world in many different languages. Set in a Cockney neighborhood of London, it combines realism, mysticism, music, dance, and ritual to create a powerful, feminist myth about modern civilization. Jellicoe revised the original 1958 version in 1962 to create a better play.
The play's title derives from a Hindu religious saying: "All creation is the sport of my mad mother Kali" (a Hindu goddess). However, as most Londoners know, "the sport of me mad mother" is also a cockney expression implying something highly unusual.
Jellicoe’s best known play is "The Knack" first performed at the Royal Court in 1962. A major hit, the play was later adapted into a film which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes. Directed by Richard Lester; the film's cast included Michael Crawford and Rita Tushingham. In it a group of young, London adults clash and commiserate about how to get "the knack" with the opposite sex. Jellicoe has also written plays for children.
One of Jellicoe's most interesting works is a brief essay entitled, "Some Unconscious Influences in the Theatre." In a space of about thirty pages, she devises a number of complex yet common-sense theories which account for the reasons why audiences react to stage and screen as they do.
The Colway Theatre Trust.
In 1978, Jellicoe set up the Colway Theatre Trust to explore the concept of Community Plays: pioneering work which she continued to develop over the next ten years. Jon Oram became artistic director of Colway Theatre in 1985 - now called Claque Theatre.
Colway Theatre Trust are the founders of the Community Play genre. A community play as practiced by Colway is the result of no less than 18 months work. They are original plays written for and about a specific community. The writer generally works with a community research team. Plays are traditionally performed in a promenade style where the audience and cast share the same space with action happening on stages around the edge of that space and in the body of the standing audience. In 2000, Colway Theatre relocated to Kent in the South East of England and changed its name to Claque. Today the company is of international standing, run by Jon Oram who has written, produced or directed over 30 productions.
In 1962, she married photographer Roger Mayne.

Vernon Ahmadjian

Vernon Ahmadjian (19 May 1930, Whitinsville, Massachusetts – 13 March 2012, Falmouth, Massachusetts) was a distinguished professor at Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA.—He specialized in the symbiosis of lichens, and wrote several books and numerous publications on the subject.
After graduating with his BA in 1952 from Clark University, Ahmadjian served for two years in the United States Army in the Combat Medical Corps during the Korean War. Upon his return to civilian life, Ahmadjian continued his studies at Clark, receiving his MA in 1956, and then went on to achieve his PhD from Harvard University in 1960.
Owing to his lichen field work in the 1960s at McMurdo Station in Antarctica, the National Science Foundation awarded him with the Antarctic Medal in 1967, and gave a peak in the Queen Alexandria Range of the Transantarctic Mountains the name of “Ahmadjian Peak”.
In 1996, Ahmadjian was honored by the International Association for Lichenology (IAL) with an Acharius Medal for outstanding research in the field of lichenology.

Government of Russia

The Government of the Russian Federation () exercises executive power in the Russian Federation. The members of the government are the Prime Minister of Russia (Chairman of the Government), the deputy prime ministers, and the federal ministers. It has its legal basis in the Constitution of the Russian Federation and the federal constitutional law "On the Government of the Russian Federation".
According to the 1978 Russian Constitution, the President of Russia was a head of executive branch and headed the Council of Ministers of Russia. According to the current 1993 Constitution of Russia, the President of Russia is not a part of the Government of Russia, which exercises executive power. The Chapter 6 of the Constitution of Russia says, that "The Government of the Russian Federation consists of the Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation, Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation and federal ministries".
Overview.
After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian Council of Ministers had become the main executive body. At some points it contained over 69 state committees, 16–17 ministers, 5 federal services, and over 46 governmental agencies. After the 2004 reform, government duties were split between 17 ministries, 5 federal services, and over 30 governmental agencies.
The prime minister is appointed by the president of the Russian Federation (currently Vladimir Putin), and confirmed by the State Duma. He or she succeeds to the presidency if the current president dies, is incapacitated, or resigns. The current prime minister is Dmitry Medvedev.
History.
The body was preceded by Government of the Soviet Union. Since the Russian Federation emerged in 1991, the government's structure has undergone several major changes. In the initial years, government bodies, primarily the different ministries, underwent massive reorganization as the old Soviet governing networks were adapted to the new state. Many reshuffles and renamings occurred.
On November 28, 1991, President of the RSFSR Boris Yeltsin signed presidential decree №242 "On reorganization of the government bodies of the RSFSR" (Russian: "О реорганизации центральных органов государственного управления РСФСР").
The most recent change took place on May 21, 2012 when President Vladimir Putin signed presidential decree on forming Dmitry Medvedev's Cabinet.
Responsibilities and power.
The government is the subject of the 6th chapter of the Constitution of the Russian Federation. According to the constitution, the government of the Russian Federation must:

École européenne de chimie, polymères et matériaux

The European School of Chemistry, Polymers and Materials Science (ECPM) of Strasbourg is a public engineering school in the city of Strasbourg, in Alsace, France. It was founded in 1948, and is located on the Cronenbourg Campus of the University of Strasbourg. Each year 90 students graduate from the school with a diplôme d'ingénieur. It is a National School of Engineers, part of the University of Strasbourg and a member of the Fédération Gay-Lussac, which recruits from the common polytechnic entrance examination. It is also part of the Alsace Tech network of nine engineering schools in Alsace. The ECPM offers its students three specialties: chemistry (analytical or organic), polymers or materials.

→ Admission to the CP2i class in the ECPM, after the Baccalaureate, or an equivalent foreign degree for the international students.
There is no competitive exam, but every student should submit their school results. Then there are interview to evaluate the motivations with the people in charge of the Chem.I.St programme. Approximately 50 students are selected every year. There are nearly 20% international students.
CP2I / Classe préparatoire intégrée internationale.
This class allows the students to gain admission to a school of the Fédération Gay Lussac (19 schools) after two years. This 2 years consist of studying engineer's trades in the domain of chemistry.
There are 4 CPIs in France: Rennes, Clermont-Ferrand, Lille and Strasbourg at the ECPM
The last one was opened at the start of the 2011-12 school year in Strasbourg. The speciality of this school is that it welcomes a large number of international students, as well as that 20% of the courses are delivered in English and 10% are delivered in German (optional). There are 50 students in each year.
To gain admission to the CP2I:
Students are selected on the basis of their academic record and a 20-minute interview.
International students are also selected on the basis of their academic record and an interview.
General presentation of CPI-CHEM.I.ST :
The CPI-CHEM.I.ST base of more practical work than in an intensive foundation degree, with high-quality laboratory.
Speciality.
The speciality is chosen in the second year. Students have four possibilities: 
Chemistry: 
Organic Chemistry: With this speciality, students attain a high level in synthesis and characterization of organic chemistry.
Analytical Chemistry: Students are trained in techniques of analysis within the context of quality control. 
Polymers: Students are trained to become flexible engineers in the polymer industry.
Materials: Students are trained in physics and chemistry of functional materials. Students become engineers specializing in conception and development of materials with an added value.
Community life.
There are several associations managed by school's students :
- l'Amicale (BDE) (or "Student Union" ) : It manages associative and festive life of the school, organizes students foyer's functioning, publishes students' directory and organizes events like, for example, new students integration's weekend. About ten clubs exist in the association like the Arts' Office, DéméTerre (sustainable development), Theatre Club, Manga Club, Cine Club, Gastronomy Club, study trip, etc.
- Le Bureau des Sports (BDS° (or Sports Office) : It allows students to do sport, to participate to university competitions and organizes events like a nice trip at the month for a weekend or at the Tournoi Inter-Chimie (TIC) in spring. Moreover, the ECPM won this sports and festive event in 2006 which has been organized in Mulhouse.
- Le "Forum Horizon Chimie" (FHC) : It's the ECPM's association that organize a forum which happens every year at la Maison de la Chimie in Paris.
Moreover, a junior company, Strasbourg Chimie Service, allows students-employed to make some punctual missions like chemical analyses, scientific conferences or translations of publications.
It also exists l'Amicale des Ingénieurs de Chimie de Strasbourg (Association of the Strasbourg's Engineers of Chemistry). It's an association aiming at conservation and relations' strengthening between graduates and students. It has in particular for ultimate objective the creation of a robust and big network ECPM, a very great tool for successful career.
-Student common room 
The ECPM Student common room is the center of the school. It is a place where students can relax after lunch or during off-peak times. 
It is a big place where you can find a table football, a billiard table, many couches and tables and even a microwave. In fact, it is possible to eat food you’ve brought. Moreover, there is a mezzanine with a hi-fi system, which makes you think of a nightclub and a terrace which is surrounded by trees and is really cozy.
Everyone has the right to go to the student common room, the students in the engineering cycle and the CPI’s. Furthermore, the BDE and the BDS (respectively student union and sports office) sometime organize parties in the student common room (for example barbecues) to bring the whole school together. For example there is the Welcome Party every year for new students.
Partners and networks.
The ECPM participated to many different networks in order to communicate with factories, institutions or students . 
That different networks are : 
-The Gay- Lussac federation : The federations was found by Louis Joseph Gay Lussac. It regroups no more than 19th schools of chemistry and chemical engineering.These 19 schools, through their teaching activities,research and training,are working together to raise awareness, develop and promote engineering courses in chemistry .
-The network “ Alsace Tech “ : Alsace Tech regroups 12 reputed engineering, management and architecture schools of Alsace. Its main objective is to promote, to contribute to the national and international influence and to increase the legibility of its schools members .
Scientific Research.
The ECPM is a hub for scientific research. Five laboratories associated with the CNRS form the ECPM's research federation. The fields of research are varied : materials, catalysis, polymers, organic synthesis, analysis of biomolecules. The laboratories collaborate with industries and major European research organizations as part of European agreements. A 1000m² hall with a cleanroom further the exchanges with industry. 
Associated Laboratories
- The SYBIO Laboratory (Synthèse Organique et Molécules Bioactives) 
- Laboratoire de Chimie Bioorganique et Médicale 
- The Nierengarten group
- Laboratoire de Synthèse et Catalyse Asymétrique (SynCat) 
- Laboratoire de Chimie organométallique
Food services.
You can find different kinds of food services in and around the campus.
- Restaurant universitaire (RU): this is the place where the majority of the students come everyday.We have the choice between three different main courses : today's special, world's dish, and the grill. We can also take a starter and a dessert, the whole for 3€15. You can eat in a large room with all the campus' students : CPI, engineers, students of the IUT Louis Pasteur...
- Mini R : It's a new concept ! It's located above the RU. The principle is the same as a cafeteria. You choose what you want : sandwiches, fagotine, fruits, desserts, drinks, and some hot food like pizzas, paninis, pasta and wok boxes, kebab, hot dog... You can eat there or take away. 
- Vending machine : you can find it in the school, next to the coffee machine. There are several kinds of sandwiches, but all of them are industrial.
- In the common room : it's mainly the place where the engineers eat because they are contributors (prices are less expansive for them). If you bring some food from your flat, you can warm up there : there are ovens and stove tops. 
- Fast food and supermarkets : Finally, there is an area next to the IUT Louis Pasteur with fast food like Mac Donald, Mezzo di Pasta or supermarkets (Liddl, Intermarché). 
Ranking.
According to the "Point" newspaper, the ECPM was ranked 18th in 2007 and was the leading chemistry schools in that rank (excluding chemical engineering) before the ENSCP which occupied the 30th rank. According to "L'Express",the school was ranked 27th as a "post-prépa" engineering school in 2008, behind the National School of Chemistry of Paris in the category of chemistry schools. Concerning starting incomes, the ECPM was ranked 10th by "L'Usine Nouvelle" in 2007. In the same newspaper, the ECPM is ranked 6th as a school betting on self-knowledge, that is to say a school devoting a large part to non-scientific lectures.

Epiphone Valve Junior

The Epiphone Valve Junior is a small 5 watt class A electric guitar amplifier.
History.
The Epiphone Valve Jr. version 1 combo was released in 2005 as a part of Epiphone's line of amplifiers. In January 2006 a head version was released and also a version 2 combo. In June 2007 an updated head version and a version 3 combo were released. The first Epiphone Valve Juniors (version 1) were only combo amplifiers and received only a fair reception, due to such problems as buzzing and hum caused by the AC filament voltage. Epiphone then released a head version, correcting these issues and changed the AC filament voltage to DC voltage. Version 2 combos also featured these modifications. The version 1 and version 2 combos feature an 8" 4 ohm Ceramic speaker.
Epiphone released Combo version 3 and a newer version of the head with higher retail prices and feature a variety of tube brands based on availability including Electro-Harmonix, JJ, and Sovtek. The newer versions of the head and version 3 combos feature updated transformers with 4, 8 and 16 ohm outputs and the version 3 combos feature an 8" 16 ohm Eminence Lady Luck speaker. In 2007, Epiphone released a speaker cabinet that can be used with the Epiphone Valve Junior, featuring a 1x 12" 16 ohm Eminence Lady Luck speaker rated at 70watts RMS.
As of summer 2012, these amps appear to have been dropped from the line. The Amps page no longer exists on the Epiphone website.
Modifications.
The Epiphone Valve Junior has become very popular to modify because of its basic design. There are many websites, kits, and forums dedicated to this purpose, including the Epiphone official amps and accessories forum. Some sites offer kits to match the gain characteristics of Marshall, Fender and Vox amplifiers. These kits often do not include a bridge rectifier to convert the version 1 AC filament supply voltage to DC, instead they suggest twisting the AC leads together to cancel the generated electromagnetic fields, a technique used in twisted-pair Ethernet cable to eliminate cross-talk.
Valve Junior Hot Rod.
A somewhat limited edition of the Valve Junior head was produced by Epiphone, dubbed the Valve Junior Hot Rod. It was released as a response to the extensive number of modifications that were being applied to the regular Valve Junior. The circuitry was altered to include a second 12AX7 preamp tube, a gain control, and a spring reverb in addition to the single volume control, as well as a standby switch to preserve tube life. Thanks to a dual function jack on the amp's rear panel, the Hot Rod can also be used as a standalone reverb unit to be used in conjunction with another amplifier's input or effects loop. In this function, the gain knob becomes the unit's dwell control, the volume knob retains its level function, and the reverb knob becomes the mixture control. When used as a reverb unit, the Hot Rod does not need to have a speaker connected to its output jacks because an internal "dummy load" activates automatically when the Reverb output jack is used.
Serial Numbers.
The first 4 digits of the serial number are the date code MMYY (MM=month, YY=year). Version 2 Valve Juniors have date codes starting at "0106" January 2006 up to June 2007 when version 3 was released.

Bin Laden Issue Station

The Bin Laden Issue Station (1996–2005) was a unit of the Central Intelligence Agency dedicated to tracking Osama bin Laden and his associates.
Soon after its creation, the Station developed a new, deadlier vision of bin Laden's activities. The CIA inaugurated a grand plan against al-Qaeda in 1999, but struggled to find the resources to implement it. Nevertheless, by 9/11 the Agency achieved almost complete reporting on the militants in Afghanistan, excluding bin Laden's inner circle itself.
In 2000, a joint CIA-USAF project using Predator reconnaissance drones and following a program drawn up by the Bin Laden Station, produced probable sightings of the al-Qaeda leader in Afghanistan. Resumption of flights in 2001 was delayed by arguments over a missile-armed version of the aircraft. Only on September 4, 2001 was the go-ahead given for weapons-capable drones. Also in 2001, CIA chief George Tenet set up a Strategic Assessments Branch, to remedy the deficiency of big-picture analysis on Islamist terrorism. The branch's head took up his job on September 10, 2001.
Conception, birth and growth.
The idea was born from discussions within the CIA's senior management, and that of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center (CTC). David Cohen, head of the CIA's Directorate of Operations, and others, wanted to try out a virtual station, modeled on the Agency's overseas stations, but based near Washington DC and dedicated to a particular issue. The unit "would fuse intelligence disciplines into one office—operations, analysis, signals intercepts, overhead photography and so on". Cohen had trouble getting any Directorate of Operations officer to run the unit. He finally recruited Michael Scheuer, an analyst then running the CTC's Islamic Extremist Branch; Scheuer "was especially knowledgeable about Afghanistan". Scheuer, who "had noticed a recent stream of reports about Bin Ladin and something called al Qaeda", suggested that the new unit "focus on this one individual" Cohen agreed.
The Station opened in January 1996, as a unit under the CTC. Scheuer set it up and headed it from that time until spring 1999. The Station was an interdisciplinary group, drawing on personnel from the CIA, FBI, NSA, DIA and elsewhere in the intelligence community. Formally known as the Bin Ladin Issue Station, it was codenamed Alec Station, after Michael Scheuer's son's name, as referred to by DIA's Able Danger liaison Anthony Shaffer. By 1999 the unit's staff had nicknamed themselves the "Manson Family", "because they had acquired a reputation for crazed alarmism about the rising al Qaeda threat".
The Station originally had twelve professional staff members, including CIA analyst Alfreda Frances Bikowsky and former FBI agent Daniel Coleman. This figure grew to 40–50 employees by September 11, 2001. (The CTC as a whole had about 200 and 390 employees at the same dates.)
CIA chief George Tenet later described the Station's mission as "to track Laden, collect intelligence on him, run operations against him, disrupt his finances, and warn policymakers about his activities and intentions". By early 1999 the unit had "succeeded in identifying assets and members of Bin Laden's organization ...".
New view of al-Qaeda, 1996–1998.
Soon after its inception, the Station began to develop a new, deadlier vision of al-Qaeda. In May 1996, Jamal Ahmed al-Fadl walked into a US embassy in Africa and established his credentials as a former senior employee of Bin Laden. Al-Fadl had lived in the US in the mid-1980s, and had been recruited to the Afghan "mujaheddin" through the al-Khifa center at the Farouq mosque in Brooklyn. Al-Khifa was the interface of Operation Cyclone, the American effort to support the mujaheddin, and the Peshawar, Pakistan-based Services Office of Abdullah Azzam and Osama bin Laden, whose purpose was to raise recruits for the struggle against the Soviets in Afghanistan. Al-Fadl had joined al-Qaeda in 1989, apparently in Afghanistan. Peter Bergen called him the third member of the organization (presumably after Azzam and bin Laden). But al-Fadl had since embezzled $110,000 from al-Qaeda, and now wanted to defect.
Al-Fadl was persuaded to come to the United States by Jack Cloonan, an FBI special agent who had been seconded to the Bin Laden Issue Station. There, from late 1996, under the protection of Cloonan and his colleagues, al-Fadl "provided a major breakthrough on the creation, character, direction and intentions of al Qaeda". "Bin Laden, the CIA now learned, had planned multiple terrorist operations and aspired to more"—including the acquisition of weapons-grade uranium. Another "walk-in" source (since identified as L'Houssaine Kherchtou) "corroborated" al-Fadl's claims. "By the summer of 1998", Scheuer later summed up, "we had accumulated an extraordinary array of information on [al-Qaeda] and its intentions."
The reams of new information that the CIA's Bin Ladin unit had been developing since 1996 had not been pulled together and synthesized for the rest of the government. Indeed, analysts in the unit felt that they were viewed as alarmists even within the CIA. A National Intelligence Estimate on terrorism in 1997 had only briefly mentioned Bin Ladin, and no subsequent national estimate would authoritatively evaluate the terrorism danger until after 9/11. Policymakers knew there was a dangerous individual,Usama Bin Ladin,whom they had been trying to capture and bring to trial. Documents at the time referred to Bin Ladin "and his associates" or Bin Ladin and his "network." They did not emphasize the existence of a structured worldwide organization gearing up to train thousands of potential terrorists.
Al Qaeda operated as an organization in more than sixty countries, the CIA's Counterterrorist Center calculated by late 1999. Its formal, sworn, hard-core membership might number in the hundreds. Thousands more joined allied militias such as the Taliban or the Chechen rebel groups or Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines or the Islamic movement of Uzbekistan.
First capture plan and US embassy attacks, 1997–98.
In May 1996 bin Laden moved from Sudan to Afghanistan. Scheuer saw the move as a (further) "stroke of luck". Though the CIA had virtually abandoned Afghanistan after the fall of the Soviet puppet regime in 1991, case officers had re-established some contacts while tracking down Kasi, the Pakistani gunman who had murdered two CIA employees in 1993. "One of the contacts was a group associated with particular tribes among Afghanistan's ethnic Pashtun community." The team, dubbed "TRODPINT" by the CIA, was provisioned with arms, equipment and cash by the CTC, and set up residence around Kandahar. Kasi was captured in June 1997. CTC chief Jeff O'Connell then "approved a plan to transfer the Afghans agent teams from the [CIA's] Kasi cell to the bin Laden unit".
By autumn 1997 the Station had roughed out a plan for TRODPINT to capture bin Laden and hand him over for trial, either to the US or an Arab country. In early 1998 the Cabinet-level Principals Committee apparently gave their blessing, but the scheme was abandoned in the spring for fear of collateral fatalities during a capture attempt.
In August 1998 militants truck-bombed the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. President Clinton ordered cruise-missile strikes on bin Laden's training camps in Afghanistan. But there was no "follow-up" action to these strikes.
New leadership and the new Plan, 1999.
In December 1998 CIA chief Tenet "declared war" on Osama bin Laden. Early in 1999 Tenet "Ordered the CTC to begin a 'baseline' review of the CIA's operational strategy against bin Laden". In the spring he "demanded 'a new, comprehensive plan of attack' against bin Laden and his allies".
As an evident part of the new strategy, Tenet removed Mike Scheuer from the leadership of the Bin Laden Station. (Later that year Scheuer resigned from the CIA.) Tenet appointed Richard Blee, a "fast-track executive assistant" who "came directly from Tenet's leadership group", to have authority over the Station. "Tenet quickly followed this appointment with another: He named Cofer Black as director of the entire CTC."
The CTC produced a "comprehensive plan of attack" against bin Laden and "previewed the new strategy to senior CIA management by the end of July 1999. By mid-September, it had been briefed to CIA operational level personnel, and to NSA [National Security Agency, the FBI, and other partners." The strategy "was called simply, 'the Plan'."
Black also arranged for a CIA team, headed by Alec Station chief Blee, to visit Northern Alliance leader Ahmad Shah Massoud to discuss operations against bin Laden. The mission was codenamed "JAWBREAKER-5", the fifth in a series of such missions since autumn 1997. The team went in late October 1999. After the meeting, Alec Station believed that Massoud would be a second source of information on bin Laden.
he CIA considered the possibility of putting U.S. personnel on the ground in Afghanistan. The CIA had been discussing this option with Special Operations Command and found enthusiasm on the working level but reluctance at higher levels. CIA saw a 95 percent chance of Special Operations Command forces capturing Bin Ladin if deployed – but less than a 5 percent chance of such a deployment.
Once Cofer Black had finalized his operational plan in the fall of 1999 to go after al-Qa'ida, Allen associate deputy director of central intelligence for collection created a dedicated al-Qa'ida cell with officers from across the intelligence community. This cell met daily, brought focus to penetrating the Afghan sanctuary, and ensured that collection initiatives were synchronized with operational plans. Allen met with on a weekly basis to review initiatives under way. His efforts were enabling operations and pursuing longer-range, innovative initiatives around the world against al-Qa'ida.
Tenet testified that "by September 11, 2001, a map would show that these collection programs and human networks nearly covered Afghanistan."
The core 9/11 hijackers emerge.
Beginning in September 1999 the CTC picked up multiple signs that bin Laden had set in motion major terrorist attacks for the turn of the year. The CIA set in motion the "largest collection and disruption activity in the history of mankind" (as Cofer Black later put it). The CTC focused in particular on three groups of Qaeda personnel: those known to have been involved in terrorist attacks; and senior personnel both outside and inside Afghanistan—e.g. "operational planner Abu Zubaydah" and "Bin Ladin deputy Muhammad Atef".
Amid this activity, in November–December 1999 Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, Ziad Jarrah and Nawaf al-Hazmi visited Afghanistan, where they were selected for the "planes operation" that was to become known as 9/11. Al-Hazmi undertook guerrilla training at Qaeda's Mes Aynak camp (along with two Yemenis who were unable to get US entry visas). The camp was located in an abandoned Russian copper mine near Kabul, and was for a time in 1999 the only such training camp in operation. Atta, al-Shehhi and Jarrah met Muhammad Atef and bin Laden in Kandahar, and were instructed to go back to Germany to undertake pilot training.
At about this time the SOCOM-DIA operation Able Danger also identified a potential Qaeda unit, consisting of the future leading 9/11 hijackers Atta, al-Shehhi, al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi. It termed them the "Brooklyn cell", because of some associations with the New York district. Evidently at least some of the men were physically and legally present in the United States, since there was an ensuing legal tussle over the "right" of "quasi-citizens" not to be spied on.
In late 1999 the National Security Agency (NSA), following up information from the FBI's investigation of the 1998 US embassy attacks, picked up traces of "an operational cadre", consisting of Nawaf al-Hazmi, his companion Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf's younger brother Salem, who were planning to go to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in January 2000. Seeing a connection with the attacks, a CTC officer sought permission to surveil the men.
The CIA tracked al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar as they traveled to and attended the al-Qaeda summit in Kuala Lumpur during the first week of January 2000. "The Counterterrorist Center had briefed the CIA leadership on the gathering in Kuala Lumpur ... The head of the Bin Ladin unit kept providing updates", unaware at first that the information was out-of-date. 
When two FBI agents assigned to the station, Mark Rossini and Doug Miller, learned that al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar had entry visas to the United States, they attempted to alert the FBI. CIA officials in management positions over the FBI agents denied their request to pass along this information to FBI headquarters. Michael Scheuer would later deny this, instead blaming the FBI for not having a "useable computer system".
In March 2000, it was learned that al-Hazmi had flown to Los Angeles. The men were not registered with the State Department's TIPOFF list, nor was the FBI told.
There are also allegations that the CIA surveiled Mohamed Atta in Germany from the time he returned there in January/February 2000, until he left for the US in June 2000.
Predator drone, 2000–2001.
In spring 2000, officers from the Bin Laden Station joined others in pressing for "Afghan Eyes", the Predator reconnaissance drone program for locating bin Laden in Afghanistan. In the summer, "The bin Laden unit drew up maps and plans for fifteen Predator flights, each lasting just under twenty-four hours." The flights were scheduled to begin in September. In autumn 2000, officers from the Station were present at Predator flight control in the CIA's Langley headquarters, alongside other officers from the CTC, and US Air Force drone pilots. Several possible sightings of bin Laden were obtained as drones flew over his Tarnak-Farms residence near Kandahar. Late in the year, the program was suspended because of bad weather.
Resumption of flights in 2001 was delayed by arguments over an armed Predator. A drone equipped with adapted "Hellfire" anti-tank missiles could be used to try to kill bin Laden and other Qaeda leaders. Cofer Black and the bin Laden unit were among the advocates. But there were both legal and technical issues. In the summer the CIA "conducted classified war games at Langley ... to see how its chain of command might responsibly oversee a flying robot that could shoot missiles at suspected terrorists"; a series of live-fire tests in the Nevada desert (involving a mockup of bin Laden's Tarnak residence) produced mixed results.
Tenet advised cautiously on the matter at a meeting of the Cabinet-level Principals Committee on September 4, 2001. If the Cabinet wanted to empower the CIA to field a lethal drone, Tenet said, "they should do so with their eyes wide open, fully aware of the potential fallout if there were a controversial or mistaken strike". National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice concluded that the armed Predator was required, but evidently not ready. It was agreed to recommend to the CIA to resume reconnaissance flights. The "previously reluctant" Tenet then ordered the Agency to do so. The CIA was now "authorized to deploy the system with weapons-capable aircraft, but for reconnaissance missions only", since the host nation (presumably Uzbekistan) "had not agreed to allow flights by weapons-carrying aircraft".
Subsequent to 9/11, approval was quickly granted to ship the missiles, and the Predator aircraft and missiles reached their overseas location on September 16, 2001. The first mission was flown over Kabul and on September 18 without carrying weapons. Subsequent host nation approval was granted on October 7 and the first armed mission was flown on the same day.
Strategic branch, 2001.
Despite increases in staff, "even into 2001 the Bin Ladin unit knew it needed more people—particularly experienced Headquarters desk officers and targeters—to meet the HUMINT challenge. In [an early Spring 2001 briefing to the DCI (George Tenet), CTC requested hiring a small group of contractors not involved in day-to-day crises to digest vast quantities of information and develop targeting strategies. The briefing emphasized that the unit needed people, not money."
The briefing was apparently in response to an initiative from Tenet, who in late 2000 had "recognized the deficiency of strategic analysis against al Qaeda. To tackle this problem within the CTC he appointed a senior manager, who briefed him in March 2001 on 'creating a strategic assessment capability.'"
A strategic analyst on 9/11.
"On the morning of September 11, 2001, Fulton and his team at the CIA were running a pre-planned simulation to explore the emergency response issues that would be created if a plane were to strike a building." So said an advance-publicity pamphlet for a security conference held in 2002.
The Strategic Assessments Branch was "created" in July 2001. "The decision to add about ten analysts to this effort was seen as a major bureaucratic victory, but the CTC labored to find them. The new chief of this branch reported for duty on September 10, 2001."
After 9/11.
Shortly after 9/11, Michael Scheuer came back to the Station as special adviser. He stayed until 2004.
After the September 11 attacks, staff numbers at the Station were expanded into the hundreds. Scheuer claimed the expansion was a "shell game" played with temporary (and inexperienced) staff, and that the core personnel "remained at under 30, the size it was when Scheuer left office in 1999". (As we have seen, professional staff numbers grew to 40 to 50 by the eve of 9/11.)
After 9/11, "Hendrik V.", and later "Marty M.", were chiefs of Alec Station's Bin Laden Unit.
The Bin Laden Station was disbanded in late 2005.
In 2011, Ray Nowosielski and John Duffy (who had previously made the documentary film ""), published the documentary "Who is Rich Blee". They focused on the CIA preventing information from reaching the FBI before 9/11, and the filmmakers deduced the identities of several CIA agents inside the Bin Laden Issue Station using open source research they found in public publications. Before they released their documentary, the CIA threatened them under the Intelligence Identities Protection Act. Their documentary was posted with the names redacted. But they claim their webmaster accidentally posted some emails that contained the identities, which were later spread to the wider internet.

To the Devil — a Diva!

To the Devil — a Diva! is a novel by English author, Paul Magrs.
Synopsis.
Karla Sorensen is the fading one-time star of a glut of low-budget Hammer-style horror movies from the 1960s and 1970s, who finds herself in the new millennium short on cash and willing to work anywhere - even on Menswear, the most cutting-edge soap opera on television.
Fortunately, as she sold her soul to the Devil during the World War II, Karla has hidden reserves to fall back on...
Trivia.
Professor John Cleavis is based on author C. S. Lewis, and first appeared in Magrs' Doctor Who novel "Mad Dogs and Englishmen" (2002) and then in Philip Purser-Hallard's Time Hunter novella, "Peculiar Lives".
The title is a play on the title of the 1953 Dennis Wheatley novel, "To the Devil - a Daughter!", which was made into a movie by Hammer in 1976.

National Research Service Award

The Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards (usually referred to as NRSA) are a family of grants provided by the United States National Institutes of Health for training researchers in the behavioral sciences and health sciences. They are a highly selective and very prestigious source of funding for doctoral and postdoctoral trainees. The grants are awarded based on lengthy proposals submitted by applicants in which original experimental plans are described. The proposals are evaluated and given an impact score reflecting scientific merit by a study section at the Center for Scientific Review at the NIH. Only applications with very good impact scores are funded, based on budget cutoffs determined by each individual institute. US citizenship or permanent residency is required. The NIH awarded $77,000,000 in individual grants and over $600,000,000 in institutional training grants in fiscal year 2005[http://grants.nih.gov/training/outcomes.htm]. 
NRSA awards are mostly given to students working on a Ph.D or an MD or other medical degree, or to individuals who have just earned one of these degrees and are beginning their careers. The NRSA program also provides institutions with training grants that can be used to fund one or more students. NRSA grants are notable for their flexibility: postdoctoral students can propose to work at any university, and the only requirement is that they commit to at least one year of research in their field following their first year of funding.

Moulton plane

In incidence geometry, the Moulton plane is an example of an affine plane in which Desargues' theorem does not hold. It is named after the American astronomer Forest Ray Moulton. The points of the Moulton plane are simply the points in the real plane R2 and the lines are the regular lines as well with the exception, that for lines with a negative slope the slope doubles when they pass the "y"-axis.
Formal definition.
The Moulton plane is an incidence structure formula_1, where formula_2 denotes the set of points, formula_3 the set of lines and formula_4 the incidence relation "lies on":
formula_7 is just a formal symbol for an element formula_8. It is used to describe vertical lines, which you may think of as lines with an infinitely large slope.
The incidence relation is defined as follows:
For "p" = ("x", "y") ∈ "P" and "g" = ("m", "b") ∈ "G" we have 
Application.
The Moulton plane is an affine plane in which Desargues' theorem does not hold. The associated projective plane is consequently non-desarguesian as well. This means that there are projective planes not isomorphic to formula_10 for any (skew) field "F". Here formula_10 is the projective plane formula_12 determined by a 3-dimensional vector space.

Winchester Cathedral (song)

"Winchester Cathedral" is a song released in late 1966 by Fontana Records, whereupon it shot to the #1 spot in Canada on the "RPM 100" national singles charts and shortly thereafter in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It was released by The New Vaudeville Band, a British novelty group established by the song's composer, Geoff Stephens. Stephens was a big fan of tunes from the British music hall era (or what Americans would call "vaudeville"), so he wrote "Winchester Cathedral" in that vein, complete with a Rudy Vallée soundalike
(John Carter) singing through his hands to imitate a megaphone sound. Although the song was recorded entirely by session musicians, when it became an international hit, an actual band had to be assembled. It toured extensively under the tutelage of Peter Grant, who later went on to manage The Yardbirds and Led Zeppelin. 
The tune went to No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart. It went all the way to the top in the U.S., however, displacing "You Keep Me Hangin' On" by the Supremes on December 3, 1966. After a one-week run at No. 1, "Winchester Cathedral" was knocked off the summit by the Beach Boys' "Good Vibrations", only to rebound to the top spot the following week. After two additional weeks, it was knocked off the top for good by "I'm a Believer" by The Monkees.
"Winchester Cathedral" topped the "Billboard" Easy Listening chart for four weeks. Cover records by Dana Rollin and The New Happiness reached no higher than No. 70.The Shadows recorded an instrumental version of this song on their album, "Jigsaw".
Global sales of the single were over three million, with the RIAA certification of gold disc status.
The song won the 1967 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary (R&R) Recording, despite not being a rock and roll song. An initial long-playing album including the song was issued in late 1966 by Fontana Records, also titled "Winchester Cathedral". Stephens received the 1966 Ivor Novello award for "Best Song Musically and Lyrically".

The Nostradamus Kid

The Nostradamus Kid is a 1992 Australian feature film written and directed by Bob Ellis. 
The film is a romantic comedy about the religious and sexual coming of age of a 1960s Seventh-day Adventist boy. Ken Elkin (Noah Taylor) is a "randy young man" who is told that the world is about to end. In a race against time, there's only one goal he wants to accomplish—bedding the love of his life, who just happens to be the local pastor's daughter.
It was nominated for two AFI Awards: Best Screenplay, Original & Best Achievement in Costume Design.
Production.
The project had been around for a number of years since David Puttnam suggested Bob Ellis turn his upbringing into a film and hired him to write it in 1979. Ellis:
It was quite an amazing experience, written against his impatience in 11 days in a shed that I rented two houses up, written out of memory and written with a great deal of anguish because I realised what a fool I'd been all my life and I was continuing to be the same kind of fool in the same kind of ways.
It was originally announced that it would be made in the early 1980s with Paul Cox as director, Patric Juillet and Jane Ballantyne as producer, and Robert Menzies and Sarah Walker in the lead roles. Later on John Duigan, Carl Schultz and Chris McGill were attached as directors. Phillip Adams, who was to produce with Puttnam, said "we couldn't raise the dough. It was obliterated during the 10BA rush because it wasn't expensive enough." Ellis then became a director and wanted to make it himself. He eventually succeeded in raising the money through the FFC.
Another actor was originally cast in the lead role but the FFC had reservations and suggested Ellis look further. He ended up casting Noah Taylor. "He was much less the sort of soft wimp that I'd assumed, and it was one of the happiest experiences I've ever had, working with him and those wonderful young actors," says Ellis.
The original cut was 148 minutes but Ellis got it down to 122 minutes. He then reduced it to under two hours, but thought losing those last two minutes hurt the film.
Box Office.
"The Nostradamus Kid" grossed $242,800 at the box office in Australia. Ellis:
It ended up opening in October when all the kids who might have otherwise gone to see it were studying for exams and so on. So it didn't quite break out. It was dogged at every turn by "The Piano" (1993), which I both detest and resent because it is a conscienceless piece of American betrayal of a story that wasn't very good in the first place.

Cape Cross

Cape Cross (Afrikaans: "Kaap Kruis"; German: "Das Kreuzkap"; Portuguese: "Cabo da Cruz") is a small headland in the South Atlantic in Skeleton Coast, western Namibia, on the C34 highway some 60 kilometres north of Hentiesbaai and 120 km north of Swakopmund on the west coast of Namibia.
History.
The Portuguese navigator and explorer Diogo Cão was in 1484 ordered by King João II, as part of the search for a sea route to India and the Spice Islands, to advance south into undiscovered regions along the west coast of Africa. While doing so, he was to choose some particularly salient points and claim them for Portugal by setting up on each a stone cross called padrão.
During his first voyage, thought to have taken place in 1482, he reached a place he called Monte Negro, now called Cabo de Santa Maria, roughly 150 km southwest of today’s Benguela, Angola.
During his second voyage, in 1484–1486, Cão reached Cape Cross in January 1486, being the first European to visit this area. During this voyage he proceeded ca. 1,400 km farther than during the first one. He is known to have erected two padrãos in the areas beyond his first voyage, one in Monte Negro, and the second at Cape Cross. The current name of the place is derived from this padrão. What can today be found at Cape Cross are two replicas of that first cross.
Cão’s first expedition took place only six years, and the second expedition’s end only two years before Bartholomeu Dias successfully rounded the Cape of Good Hope as the first European explorer in 1488.
Padrão.
The original Cape Cross padrão was removed in 1893 by Corvette captain Gottlieb Becker, commander of the SMS "Falke" of the German Navy, and taken to Berlin. A simple wooden cross was put in its place. The wooden cross was replaced two years later by a stone replica.
At the end of the 20th Century, thanks to private donations, another cross, more similar to the original one, was erected at Cape Cross, and thus there are now two crosses there.
The inscription on the padrão reads, in English translation:
Seal reserve.
Today Cape Cross is a protected area owned by the government of Namibia under the name Cape Cross Seal Reserve. The reserve is the home of one of the largest colonies of Cape Fur Seals in the world.
Cape Cross is one of two main sites in Namibia where seals are culled, partly for selling their hides and partly for protecting the fish stock. The economic impact of seals on the fish resources is controversial: While a government-initiated study found that seal colonies consume more fish than the entire fishing industry can catch, animal protection society Seal Alert South Africa estimated less than 0.3% losses to commercial fisheries.

<doc id="9787609" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9787609" title="Groovin'">
Groovin'

"Groovin" is a single released in 1967 by The Young Rascals that became a number-one hit and one of the group's signature songs.
Written by group members Felix Cavaliere and Eddie Brigati and with a lead vocal from Cavaliere, it is indeed a slow, relaxed groove, based on Cavaliere's newfound interest in Afro-Cuban music. Instrumentation included a conga, a Cuban-influenced bass guitar line from ace session musician Chuck Rainey, and a harmonica part, performed first for the single version by New York session musician, Michael Weinstein, and later for the album version by Gene Cornish.
The result was fairly different from the Rascals' white soul origins, enough so that Atlantic Records head Jerry Wexler did not want to release "Groovin'". Cavaliere credits disc jockey Murray the K with intervening to encourage Atlantic to release the song. “To tell you the truth, they didn’t originally like the record because it had no drum on it,” admits Cavaliere. “We had just cut it, and he (Murray the K) came in the studio to say hello. After he heard the song, he said, ‘Man, this is a smash.’ So, when he later heard that Atlantic didn’t want to put it out, he went to see Jerry Wexler and said, ‘Are you crazy? This is a friggin’ #1 record.’ He was right, because it eventually became #1 for four straight weeks.”
Lyrically, "Groovin'" is themed around a highly romantic portrayal of a couple in love:
The single became an instant hit in May 1967, bounding up the charts and then spending four weeks atop the Billboard pop singles chart. It was RIAA-certified a gold record on June 13, 1967. Showing it (and the group's) crossover appeal, it also reached number 3 on the Billboard Black Songs chart chart. Finally, "Groovin'" was the only real hit the group ever had in the United Kingdom, reaching number 8 on the UK Singles Chart.
"Groovin'" was subsequently included on The Young Rascals' late July 1967 album "Groovin"', but with the aforementioned different harmonica riff.
"Groovin'" is one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll, and is also the recipient of a Grammy Hall of Fame Award.
In other languages.
The Young Rascals recorded "Groovin" in Spanish, French and Italian in 1968.

Berambing, New South Wales

Berambing is a small village in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia. The village sits on the Bells Line of Road, between Windsor and Lithgow, west of Bilpin. It is situated across both the City of Hawkesbury and City of Blue Mountains local government areas. The settlement had a population of 28 people at the 2011 Census.
Description.
It is known for its lush apple, nuts and stone fruit orchards. The peace and natural beauty of the area attract many visitors to stay at the many local holiday/rest retreats and bed & breakfast establishments. It is in close proximity to the Mount Tomah Botanic Garden and the Wollemi and Blue Mountains national parks.
The area was first visited by Europeans in November 1804 when George Caley, the explorer and botanist, camped nearby during his unsuccessful attempt to cross the Blue Mountains. The area has had European settlement since at least 1832 when the property 'Bulgamatta' was established; now the location of the Chapel Hill Retreat.
During the mid-nineteenth century Bells Line of Road was a busy thoroughfare for herds of sheep and cattle being driven to the Sydney markets. The following description of Berambing, by an anonymous correspondent, was published in January 1861:
Berambing is between two and three miles from the summit of Mount Tomah, which is concealed by the intervening forest; but its elevation is considerable, and the climate is cool, bracing, and agreeable, and to those who can really appreciate nature there is a rich fund of enjoyment, and a field of research rendered doubly interesting from having been the scene of some of Allan Cunningham's botanical wanderings... Immediately bordering on Berambing the forest consists of peppermint, stringybark, grey gum, and mahogany. Recent rains had rendered the road muddy, and rather impeded our progress.
Well known children's author, Hesba Fay Brinsmead, was born in Berambing in 1922 and her upbringing in the area inspired much of the background for her books. Her popular "Longtime" trilogy was set in the area and based on her experiences as a child/teeneager.

The Bad Sister

The Bad Sister is a 1931 American drama film directed by Hobart Henley. The screenplay by Edwin H. Knopf, Tom Reed, and Raymond L. Schrock is based on the 1913 novel "The Flirt" by Booth Tarkington, which previously was filmed in 1916 and 1922. The film marks the screen debut of Bette Davis and features Humphrey Bogart and Zasu Pitts in supporting roles.
Plot.
Naive Marianne Madison, bored with her routine life, falls for dashing con artist Valentine Corliss, who has come to her small town looking for fresh marks to swindle. He soon charms her into faking her wealthy and prominent father's name on a letter of endorsement, which he presents to the other local merchants, who willingly give him merchandise. He prepares his escape, but not before conning Marianne into becoming his wife.
Following their wedding night in a sleazy hotel, Valentine abandons Marianne. She returns home and begs forgiveness from her jilted fiancé Dick Lindley, but having seen Marianne for who she really is, he turns his attention to her shy younger sister Laura.
Production.
The film originally was called "What a Flirt" and then "Gambling Daughters" before being changed to "The Bad Sister" just prior to its theatrical release.
Bette Davis, nervous about her appearance in her first film, consulted with studio makeup chief Jack Pierce, who "surveyed me critically, almost resentfully," she recalled for an interview in the April 1938 issue of "Good Housekeeping". "Your eyelashes are too short, hair's a nondescript color, and mouth's too small. A fat little Dutch girl's face, and a neck that's too long," he told her. He suggested a different shade of lipstick and advised her to use eye shadow, but their meeting left Davis feeling anxious and lacking self-confidence. After seeing the completed film, producer Carl Laemmle, Jr. commented, "Can you imagine some poor guy going through hell and high water and ending up with "her" at the fade-out?" 
Davis was required to change a baby in one scene, and the fact the infant was a boy was kept secret from her. When she undid the diaper and saw male genitals for the first time in her life, she was so embarrassed her face reddened enough to look deep gray on screen. 
Davis and her mother attended a preview of the film in San Bernardino. The actress was so distressed by her performance they left before the final credits and, certain her Hollywood career was over, she cried all the way home.

Karam Chand Thapar

Karam Chand Thapar (1900–1963) was the founder of the Thapar Group of companies.
He was originally from Punjab. He started his career in 1920 as a coal trader in Calcutta, and built up the family fortune through Karam Chand Thapar and Bros. He then started JCT Limited[http://www.jcttextiles.com/Thapar.htm] that is into textiles as well as molasses and alcohol. He also took over the Oriental Bank of Commerce, and ventured into paper manufacturing with the Ballarpur Industries Limited.
In 1956, he started Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology which was given the status of Deemed University in 1985 and renamed as Thapar University.
Biography.
K C Thapar established Karam Chand Thapar & Bros. Ltd. - the parent company of Karam Chand Thapar & Bros. (Coal Sales) Ltd. (KCT). Having gained some experience of the coal industry in his youth, Karam Chand set out to establish his own coal trading business based out of the Jharia coalfields in 1919. Soon thereafter, he realized that the epicenter of the coal business was not where the mines were located, but in Calcutta, the then established base of all the large European owned mining companies.
A year later, in 1920, he set out for Calcutta, the erstwhile capital of India, where he began to establish contacts with other Indian businessmen with the aim of convincing them to rally against the British stranglehold over coal production and distribution in India. That same year, he started a successful coal distribution business based out of Calcutta. As a leader, Karam Chand managed to consolidate a diverse group of investors and contractors, and incorporate them into his coal distribution network. He then began to rapidly acquire and develop coal mines in the states of Bihar, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. 
Karam Chand did not focus on coal alone but also ventured into other fields like paper, textiles, chemicals, sugar as well as banking (Oriental Bank of Commerce) and insurance (United Indian Insurance). In 1929, the flagship parent company of the Thapar Group ["the Group"], Karam Chand Thapar & Bros. Ltd., was formed. In the course of time, various companies owned and/or managed by Karam Chand were brought under its umbrella.
Personal life.
Born in 1900, he died in 1963 and was survived by four sons: Inder Mohan Thapar, Brij Mohan Thapar or BM Thapar, Lalit Mohan Thapar, or LMT, and Man Mohan Thapar.
The eldest son, Inder Mohan, was not offered the reins of the group when KCT fell sick. BMT was not ready to take on the responsibility and third son Lalit was made head of the business by KCT before his death, with the undertaking that he (LMT) would ensure that Inder Mohan's son would be given the reins after LMT turns 65 and all of LMT's brothers would be given their due share of the family business.
LMT stood by his word to his dying father and did over the years divide the group among his brothers; his not marrying helped his cause by not adding more claimants to the group assets. However he gave the reins of the bigger part of the company to Gautam Thapar, son of BMT, and gave the chemicals division to Vikram Thapar, the son of IMT.

Possibly the best-known 12-bit CPU is the PDP-8 and its relatives, such as Intersil 6100 microprocessor produced in various incarnations from August 1963 to mid-1990. Many ADCs (analog to digital converters) have a 12-bit resolution. Some PIC microcontrollers use a 12-bit word size. 
12 binary digits have 4096 (10000 octal, 1000 hexadecimal) distinct combinations. Hence, a microprocessor with 12-bit memory addresses can directly access 4096 bytes (4KiB) of word-addressable memory.

Eilon

Eilon () is a kibbutz in northern Israel. Located a mile south of Lebanese border and six miles east of the Mediterranean coast, the kibbutz sits on a ridge between two streams, Nahal Betzet and Nahal Kziv and falls under the jurisdiction of Mateh Asher Regional Council. In 2012 it had a population of around 943.
Etymology.
The name Eilon is derived from "Elah" (terebinth) and "Alon" (oak), two tree species abundant in this heavily forested area of northern Israel, though specifically referred to the "remnants of ancient trees in the vicinity."
History.
The kibbutz was established on 400 dunams of land in Khirbet Samak, purchased in 1938 by the Jewish National Fund. It was settled that year by a group of Polish immigrants and Palestinian Jews. The inhabitants found themselves under constant fire in the wake of the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. Eilon was one of the early tower and stockade settlements. Calm was achieved after the Galilee was cleared of Lebanese troops and Kaukji's bands in November 1948. 
In 1947, the kibbutz had a population of 350, successfully reclaiming rocky land that had been designated by the British Mandatory government as uncultivable. The kibbutz was initially affiliated with Hashomer Hatzair.
Economy.
Eilon derives its income from agriculture (bananas, avocado, exotic fruit, cotton); industry (Eshet Eilon manufactures agri-industrial systems to sort vegetables and fruit; Eilon Mosaic manufactures decorative mosaic); and tourism (Keshet Eilon Country Lodging is a guesthouse). A world-renowned violin master course called Keshet Eilon takes place annually in Eilon. Under the musical directorship of Itzhak Rashkovsky, fifty young violinists from around the world spend each summer receiving extensive violin instruction and performing concerts.
Volunteers.
Eilon accepts a number of International Volunteers that in return for lodgings, meals and laundry, work in a variety of locations on the kibbutz. One of the highlights of being a volunteer is the Vollies (Volunteers) Bar, which is situated close to the volunteers quarters.

<doc id="9787862" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9787862" title="Royal Park Hotel, Toxteth">
Royal Park Hotel, Toxteth

The Royal Park Hotel was a three storey, handsome public house and hotel situated on the corner of Admiral Street and North Hill Street, Toxteth, Liverpool, England. It was built in the 1860s1 as a three-storey building possibly by the brewer Walkers of Warrington. A long bar ran the length of the pub curving at the end; two other rooms had no bar and were served by waiter service, which disappeared towards the end of the pub's life. The name of the pub probably refers to the fact that Toxteth was a Royal Park - although in the inter-war years the name changed to the Admiral Hotel.2 In the 1871 England Census, it is recorded as being at 2 Admiral Street, Toxteth Park and in Ordnance Survey maps of the period it is marked as a PH on the corner of Admiral Street and North Hill Street - with a Freemasons's hall adjacent to it at 80 North Hill Street. However, in some Census the hotel is recorded as being at 84 North Hill Street.
A history of the Antient Briton Lodge records that "some time prior to 1877 a hotel had been built on the corner of Admiral Street and North Hill Street called the Masonic Arms" - although no other record of that name has yet been found.
Walker's Warrington Ales.
The census records show that the pub was managed but there is no indication who the owners were; however the photograph from the 1920s shows that the pub was selling Walker's Warrington Ales - beers brewed by Peter Walker & Sons. Currently it is unknown whether they were the original owners.
Landlords.
John Roberts is recorded as the Licensed Victualer - along with his wife Harriet - in 1871. Emily Marshall is noted as a Boarder indicating that rooms were indeed used for boarding. Elizabeth Davies is recorded as the Barmaid, and there are two servants: one had the task of being the billiard marker indicating that this was a pub activity at the time - a billiard marker kept the players' scores and chalked them on a scoring board. His duties could also include allocating tables, cues, chalk, and dealing with refreshments. In Toxeth Park Cemetery there is one monumental inscription that mentions the Royal Park Hotel: "In loving memory of John ROBERTS, of Marford Hill Gresford and formerly of the Royal Park Hotel in this city who died 21st August 1881, aged 51 years. Also of Harriet, wife of the above who died 7th May 1886, aged 70 years."3
Roberts was born in Flintshire, North Wales and his arrival in Liverpool was no doubt part of the mass movement of people from rural Wales to the greater prosperity in Liverpool. So huge was the influx into Liverpool that Welsh, Scottish and Irish immigrants accounted for over 30% of Liverpool's population by the mid 19th century. Liverpool had become a significant port, the “Gateway to the Atlantic" and was a commercial centre second only to London. The allure of continued employment in the docks, in shipping and allied industries was overwhelming.
From the mid to the end of the 19th century, Liverpool’s population more than doubled from just under 300,000 to over 700,00. At this time there were over 50,000 Welsh people living in the city and it was known as the Capital of North Wales. Toxteth was one of the districts they settled and to accommodate this influx of people rows of terraced houses were quickly built that subsequently became known as the Welsh Streets. One reference claims that in Toxteth, from 1831 to 1877, the local population had grown from 24,000 to 117,000. 
In the 1891 Census, Robert Fishlock had yet to work at the Royal Park but he was recorded as living on the Scotland Road with his occupation as Public House Manager. He had been born in Brentford Middlesex. By 1894 (see below) he had moved to the Royal Park.
Richard Burnett is recorded as the 'Public House Manager' in the 1901 Census. Aged 28, he had been born in Liverpool and was living at the Royal Park with his wife and two children. (NB: in this Census, the address is 84 North Park Street.)
The 1911 Census has Joseph Pantoll aged 57 as the Brewery's Manager at the Royal Park. He was ex-Navy and had been born in Plymouth. Interestingly his address is given as 84 North Park Street rather than Admiral Street but he also records two people resident at 2 Admiral Street: Ann Cameron, a 83 year-old widow and her granddaughter Margaret Cameron who's occupation is noted as a restaurant waitress. Perhaps she was working as a waitress at the Royal Park.
Another 'Welsh' landlord was Henry Thomas. His family too had come from North Wales moving to Liverpool in the 1830s. He was born just a few streets away in Wynnstay Street in 1891. Before the 1st World War he had been a mariner and had ended up in New Zealand. At the start of the War he joined the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, fought in Egypt, Gallipoli and France before returning to Liverpool in 1920 to take over the running of what had now been renamed as the Admiral Hotel. Here he lived with his family: wife Dorothy and two sons, Roy and Paul Thomas.
The pub's name varied over the years (licensee in brackets)4:
Demolition.
It is thought that it was during the mid 1970s that the pub was demolished, along with all the properties on the block including the adjacent Toxteth Masonic Hall, leaving an open space that was originally tarmac and part of a school. The school was demolished and the space was converted to football pitches in 2004 but then became derelict by 2010. In 2012 they were renovated and reopened as the Admiral Park Recreation Ground5.

Marion's Case

Marion's Case, the common name for the case "Secretary of the Department of Health and Community Services v JWB and SMB", is one of the primary cases under Australian law for deciding whether a child has the capacity to make decisions for themselves, and when this is not possible, who may make decisions for them regarding major medical procedures. It largely adopts the views in Gillick v West Norfolk Area Health Authority, a decision of the English House of Lords.
Background to the Case.
"Marion", a pseudonym for the 14-year-old girl at the centre of this case, suffered from intellectual disabilities, severe deafness, epilepsy and other disorders. Her parents, a married couple from the Northern Territory sought an order from the Family Court of Australia authorising them to have Marion undergo a hysterectomy and an oophrectomy (removal of ovaries)- the practical effect would be sterilisation and preventing Marion from being able to have children, and also many of the hormonal effects of adulthood.
Under the Family Law Act the primary concern for matters involving children is that the court must act in the child's best interests. The majority of the Court made it clear that this was not a consideration in this case, but that it was merely deciding a point of law and that the decision about "best interests" would be left to the Family Court of Australia after the case.
The main legal debate that arose was: who has the legal authority to authorise the operation? Three options existed: the parents (as legal guardians of their daughter), Marion, or only by order of a competent court, such as the Family Court of Australia.
The Department, together with the Attorney-General for the Commonwealth of Australia, argued that only this latter option was possible - that only a court could authorise such a major operation.
The parents, however, "argued that the decision to sterilise a child is not significantly different from other major decisions that parents and guardians have to make for children and that the involvement of the Family Court is optional and of a "supervisory nature" only. Their argument was that, provided such a procedure is in the best interests of the child, parents as guardians can give lawful consent to a sterilisation on behalf of a mentally incompetent child."
Judgment.
The High Court of Australia recognised the right of everyone to bodily integrity under national and international law, made a distinction between therapeutic and non-therapeutic surgical procedures, and the duty of surrogates to act in the best interests of the incompetent patient.
In the case, the High Court ruled that whilst parents may consent to medical treatment for their children, this authority does not extend to treatment which is not in the child’s best interests. Second, the Court held that where medical treatment has sterilisation as its principal objective, parents do not have the authority to consent on behalf of their child.
Obiter dictum.
A statement in paragraph twelve that parents may grant surrogate consent for the non-therapeutic circumcision of male children is "obiter dictum" and not part of the judgment. Male circumcision was not at issue in this case and no evidence or testimony was offered regarding male circumcision.

Cults of Unreason

Cults of Unreason is a non-fiction book on Scientology, pseudoscience, and cults, written by Christopher Riche Evans, Ph.D. The book was first published in the UK in 1973 by Harrap and in the United States in 1974 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, and then again in paperback in 1975, by Delacorte Press. The book was also published in German, by Rowohlt, in 1976.
Synopsis.
The book examines the background, founders and followers of a number of contemporary belief systems. Much of the book discusses the history of Scientology, including the early period and development of Dianetics. The book also describes the E-meter, various front groups, operating thetan, and the lifestyles of members whilst living at Scientology's then headquarters at Saint Hill Manor.
Evans also reviews what he calls "UFO cults", the Aetherians, the Atlanteans, biofeedback, yoga, theosophy, and The Fourth Way. He identifies a common theme of incorporating technological advances within a theological framework and contends that the allure of such cults is that they offer a sense of community and comfort in the face of a world dominated by science.

The Graham Gouldman Thing

The Graham Gouldman Thing was the debut album by singer and songwriter Graham Gouldman. Gouldman had already written hit singles for Herman's Hermits ("No Milk Today" and "Listen People"), the Yardbirds ("For Your Love"), the Hollies ("Bus Stop") and Wayne Fontana ("Pamela, Pamela", "The Impossible Years") and on this album Gouldman delivered his own versions of some of those songs as well as other new compositions.
Gouldman, who would later become a founding member of 10cc, recorded the album at Olympic Studios in London, a studio that would later be extensively used by Led Zeppelin. It was recorded with the assistance of John Paul Jones and Eddie Kramer, both of whom would also achieve considerable success with Led Zeppelin.
In sleeve notes for the 2004 CD re-release, Gouldman said his manager, Harvey Lisburg suggested he make the album, reworking his hits and recording new songs.
He wrote: "It was also a chance to work on a big project with John Paul Jones, with whom I had worked many times before ... he is a great bass and keyboard player who had an important influence on my playing.
"The album was supposed to have been co-produced by Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits. The idea being that the artist produces the writer. After the first session he didn't show up again, so John and I ended up producing the album with Eddie Kramer engineering."
The liner notes acknowledge the use of "some fabulous players on the sessions", but do not name them.
At the time, only one single was released from the album sessions in the UK and the album was subsequently not released in the UK until it appeared on CD years later.

Maraviroc

Maraviroc (brand-named Selzentry, or Celsentri outside the U.S.) is an antiretroviral drug in the CCR5 receptor antagonist class used in the treatment of HIV infection. It is also classed as an entry inhibitor. It also appeared to reduce graft-versus-host disease in patients treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for leukemia, in a phase 1/2 study.
Mechanism of action.
Maraviroc is an entry inhibitor. Specifically, maraviroc is a negative allosteric modulator of the CCR5 receptor, which is found on the surface of certain human cells. The chemokine receptor CCR5 is an essential co-receptor for most HIV strains and necessary for the entry process of the virus into the host cell. The drug binds to CCR5, thereby blocking the HIV protein gp120 from associating with the receptor. HIV is then unable to enter human macrophages and T-cells. Because HIV can also use other coreceptors, such as CXCR4, an HIV tropism test such as a trofile assay must be performed to determine if the drug will be effective.
Development and approval.
Maraviroc, originally designated UK-427857, was developed by the drug company Pfizer in its UK labs located in Sandwich. On April 24, 2007 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel reviewing maraviroc's New Drug Application unanimously recommended approval for the new drug, and the drug received full FDA approval on August 6, 2007 for use in treatment experienced patients.
On September 24, 2007, Pfizer announced that the European Commission approved maraviroc. Industry experts forecast annual maraviroc sales of $500 million by 2011.
Efficacy.
Two randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, known as MOTIVATE 1 & 2, compared 209 patients receiving optimized therapy plus a placebo to 426 patients receiving optimized therapy plus 150 mg maraviroc once daily and 414 patients receiving optimized therapy plus 150 mg maraviroc twice daily. At 48 weeks, 55% of participants receiving maraviroc once daily and 60% of participants receiving the drug twice daily achieved a viral load of less than 400 copies/mL compared with 26% of those taking placebo; about 44% of the once-daily and 45% of the twice-daily maraviroc group had a viral load of less than 50 copies/mL compared with about 23% of those who received placebo. In addition, those who received the entry inhibitor had a mean increase in CD4 cells of 110 cells/µL in the once-daily group, 106 cells/µL in the twice-daily group, and 56 cells/µL in the placebo group.
Safety.
The MOTIVATE trials showed no clinically relevant differences in safety between the maraviroc and placebo groups. However, researchers question the long-term safety of blocking CCR5, a receptor whose function in the healthy individual is not fully understood.

Hinduism in Nigeria

Hinduism spread to Nigeria mainly by immigration of Hindus from India and by way of Hare Krishna missionaries.
Sindhis were the first to arrive in Nigeria in the early part of the nineteenth century. Initially, they were primarily engaged in trading. But gradually, while still retaining their interest in trading, they also ventured into other fields like manufacturing and professional services. In succeeding decades, they made substantial investments in Nigeria, aggregating more than US$ 4 billion. In this way, they engaged themselves actively in the textiles sector, as well as in pharmaceuticals, fishing and various engineering industries.
Hindus of Indian origin in Nigeria.
India and Nigeria were both part of the British Empire. Indians, both Muslims and Hindus alike, were brought to Great Britain's African colonies to work on the railroads. However, most of the Indian population, along with other foreigners from across the Empire, fled to either the United Kingdom, the United States, or back to their country of origin during the Nigerian Civil War.
The Government of Nigeria follows a liberal and non-discriminatory policy in the grant of citizenship to resident foreign nationals. It is not surprising, therefore, that there are as many as 8,000 Nigerians of Indian origin in the country. It is believed that there are as many as 500,000 Indians (both foreign and native-born) in Nigeria.
Starting from the 1970s, the Nigerian government and several private sector agencies began to hire a large number of Indian doctors, teachers, engineers and other professionals. Towards the end of the 1980s, many of the Indian experts decided to return to India when, with the substantial reduction in the country’s oil revenues, the country began to face severe economic problems. In spite of this, there are still as many as 217,000 Indian expatriates in Nigeria.
Altogether, including Nigerians of Indian origin and expatriates, there are 25,000 Hindus in Nigeria. Most are resident in Lagos, the former capital of Nigeria.
Hindus of Nigerian origin.
Some Nigerians have converted to Hinduism mainly due to efforts of ISKCON Missionaries.
ISKCON inaugurated the Vedic Welfare Complex in Apapa, Lagos, launched by the Hare Krishna group in Nigeria.
Sai Organisation in Nigeria.
Sri Sathya Sai Seva (Service) Organization was originally established in 1972 as a public charitable trust to carry out the mission of Sathya Sai Baba: providing drinking water, medicine and education to everyone free of charge.
A central meeting place named as Sri Sathya Sai Baba Centre was first built in Ibadan and registered as a non-profit making spiritual organization in Nigeria. The site was leased for 99 years on April 19 with funding from various donors.
In Lagos, the Sai activities were started in a private house on Victoria Island.

Basingstoke R.F.C.

Basingstoke Rugby Football Club is a Rugby Union club based in Basingstoke, Hampshire, in southern England. The club was formed in March 1948, with two matches being played during that season, and a full fixture list for two fifteens the following season. In the early days matches were played on Basingstoke Common and later at Whiteditch Field and several other grounds within the locality. A number of local hostelries provided the headquarters until 1958 when the Cricket Pavilion at Mays Bounty became the Club’s home until the move to Down Grange in 1971.
The growth of the town resulted in a steady increase in Club strength, and there were three sides in 1963, four in 1966, five in 1970, and an occasional seventh team in 1971. During the seventies the Club was one of the strongest in the County. Playing strength declined for a while in the early eighties, but the wise investments in a strong junior and youth section paid dividends.
The advent of the knock-out competitions and leagues was welcomed at Basingstoke. The Club has won the Hampshire Cup ten times and runners-up four times. In 1993 and 1994 Basingstoke RFC reached the fourth round of the Pilkington Cup, losing to Harlequins and London Irish RFC respectively. When league rugby started in 1987/88 the Club was entered into London Division 2 which they won that year, and the following year headed London Division 1, being promoted to National League 4 South (later to become League 5 South), in which they were runners-up two years running. Regrettably a rather mixed performance in 1994/95 resulted in relegation to London Division 1. In 2008 the club was relegated to the London 2 South division. 
On two occasions Basingstoke's Sevens team has reached Twickenham and performed valiantly against first class opposition. On the second occasion they reached the final of the plate competition.
The ground fund account was opened at the AGM in 1961 with a sum of £20 which was all the Club could afford. During the late sixties fund raising and negotiations with Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council proceeded slowly. Eventually a ground lease was arranged at Down Grange. Building started in September 1970 and the Clubhouse was opened in January 1971. Once the project became a reality, fund raising improved dramatically, in addition a grant was obtained, and also a loan from the brewery.
Two years later in 1973 two more changing rooms, a referees dressing room, a store and the spectator stand to the 1st XV pitch were added, together with other improvements largely to cope with the increasing number of players and supporters. In 1984 the President’s Lounge was built which provided comfortably accommodation for members and their families. The Club was still run entirely on a voluntary basis by members, however, in December 1988 in order to make greater use of the facilities and provide a better service for members, a full-time steward was employed and has been ever since.
One more major development took place in 1991, when extensions to provide a dining area, larger kitchen, office, shop and weight training room were built. Internal improvements also included a fully equipped medical room, a new central heating system and enlargement of the bar area.
The club and all the teams are fully supported by Bizz Radio Basingstoke, the local radio station in Basingstoke.

Eusporangiate fern

Eusporangiate ferns are vascular spore plants, whose sporangia arise from several epidermal cells and not from a single cell as in leptosporangiate ferns. Typically these ferns have reduced root systems and sporangia that produce large amounts or spores (up to 7000 spores per sporangium in "Christensenia")
There are four extant eusporangiate fern families, distributed among three classes. Each family is assigned to its own order.
The following diagram shows a likely phylogenic placement of eusporangiate fern classes within the vascular plants.
Cladistics.
While it is generally accepted that the leptosporangiate ferns are monophyletic, it is considered to be likely that the eusporangiate ferns, as a group, are polyphyletic. In each of the three examples from recently published studies, shown in the following table, it can be seen that, together, the four eusporangiate fern families do not form a single clade.

Spean Bridge () is a village in the parish of Kilmonivaig, in the Highland region of Scotland.
The village takes its name from the Highbridge over the River Spean on General Wade's military road between Fort William and Fort Augustus, and not from Telford's bridge of 1819 which carries the A82 over the river at the heart of the village.
Lying in the Great Glen, Spean Bridge has transport links north towards Inverness and south to Fort William, provided by the A82, and the A86 heads east to join the A9 at Kingussie. The village is served by the Spean Bridge railway station providing links to Glasgow, London, and Mallaig and between 1903 and 1933 it offered a branch line service to Fort Augustus.
The Highbridge Skirmish on 16 August 1745 was the first engagement of the Jacobite Rising of 1745.
The Commando Memorial, dedicated to the men of the original British Commando Forces raised during Second World War, is located approximately north-west of Spean Bridge, at the junction of the A82 and the B8004. It overlooks the training areas of the Commando Training Depot established in 1942 at Achnacarry Castle.

<doc id="9788109" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9788109" title="North Devon cattle">
North Devon cattle

The Devon is an ancient breed of cattle from the south western English county of Devon. It is a rich red or tawny colour, and this gives rise to the popular appellation of Devon Ruby or Red Ruby, also used as a marketing brand. The breed is also sometimes referred to as the North Devon to avoid confusion with the more recently developed South Devon cattle breed which is yellowish brown.
Origin of the breed.
The native home of the Devon is in southwest England, primarily in the counties of Devon, Somerset, Cornwall, and Dorset. The Devon is one of several modern breeds derived from the traditional red cattle of southern England, together with the Hereford, Sussex, Lincoln Red and Red Poll.
The early improvers of the Devon breed were Francis Quartly of Great Champson, Molland, North Devon, and his elder brothers Rev. William (of West Molland Barton) and Henry (d.1840), the eldest, who took over William's herd and lease in 1816. Francis had been left the lease of Champson with its herd by his father James (d.1793) and commenced his work in improving the breed the year after his father's death. At that time during the Napoleonic Wars most of the farmers of Devon were taking advantage of the high prices offered by butchers for cattle, and the best bloodlines of the old herds were almost lost. Francis Quartly had the foresight to refuse to sell his best specimens and furthermore determined on the risky and expensive strategy of outbidding the butchers to acquire for himself what he judged to be the best representatives of the remnant of the old breed. Thus was founded the Champson herd. Francis and William died unmarried but Henry's eldest son James succeeded him at West Molland and his youngest son John succeeded his uncle Francis at Champson. Both became highly distinguished breeders of Devons. Also instrumental in the founding of the new breed were John Tanner Davy (d.1852) of nearby Rose Ash and his brother William (d.1840), of Flitton Barton. Colonel John Tanner Davy, son of John Tanner Davy, founded the Devon herdbook in 1850. In 1884, the Devon Cattle Breeders' Society was founded and took over the herdbook. Today the Dart family of Great Champson, Molland, long established in that parish, continues to breed the descendants of the Quartly herd in their original home. The herd was founded by George Dart in 1947 with animals purchased from the Molland herd, and is carried on today by the brothers William and Henry Dart.
In the United States.
In 1623 the ship "Charity" brought a consignment of red cattle (one bull and three heifers) from Devon to Edward Winslow, the agent for Plymouth Colony – these may have been of North Devon type.
Although the Devon was originally a horned breed, American stockmen have developed a polled strain of purebred Devons. It traces back to the bull Missouri 9097, a hornless individual born in 1915 in the Devon herd owned by Case and Elling in Concordia, Missouri.
The Devon was previously classified as a dual-purpose breed (dairy & beef). Over the past half century, however, the breed has developed as a beef-type breed. The rate of maturity has been accelerated, and a common criticism of light hindquarters and sickle hocks have been reduced to a minimum. Devons have become longer, taller, and trimmer, but not to such extremes as in some other breeds. The traditional multi-purpose animals still exist in the United States and are now known as the American Milking Devon, though they are very rare. They are registered with the American Milking Devon Cattle Association.
In Australia.
Devons were popular for use in bullock teams for hauling cedar and other logs from the forests, which was pit sawn and then transported by bullock drawn wagons and timber junkers to towns and seaports for cabinet making or export. These cattle were among the earliest breeds in Australia and Devons were noted for their docility, early maturing, hardiness and strength which were important attributes to have in a team.
Characteristics of the modern breed.
Devon cattle are red in colour, varying in shade from a rich deep red to a light red or chestnut colour. A bright ruby red colour is preferred and accounts for their nickname, the "Red Ruby". The hair is of medium thickness and is often long and curly during the winter, but short and sleek in summer. The switch of the tail is creamy white.
Mature bulls in good working condition weigh from to about . Mature cows range in weight from about to about . Thus, Devons have enough size to be practical and profitable without the handicap of excessive maintenance cost.
Calving problems are seldom encountered although a growing stress on using larger bulls has increased the incidence of difficult births. 
The functional characteristics of the Devon make them a valuable genetic tool for the commercial beef industry. The breed has long been noted for its fertility, ease of calving, docility, hardiness and ability to adapt to temperature extremes.
Devons are active good "walkers" and are excellent foragers. Their ability to utilize grass and other forages efficiently has heightened their popularity in areas like southern Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand.
In recent years however, the breed has fallen out of favour, as more rapidly growing continental breeds were in demand by both the farmer and butcher because of their speed of maturity and the quantity of higher-value cuts they produce. However, that meat has always been of a lower-eating quality than that of the slower-maturing grass-fed traditional breeds.

James Miller (architect)

James Miller (1860–1947) was a Scottish architect, recognised for his commercial architecture in Glasgow and for his Scottish railway stations. Notable among these are the American-influenced Union Bank building at 110-20 St Vincent Street; his 1901-1905 extensions to Glasgow Central railway station; and Wemyss Bay railway station on the Firth of Clyde. His lengthy career resulted in a wide range of building types, and, with the assistance of skilled draughtsmen such as Richard M Gunn, he adapted his designs to changing tastes and new architectural materials and technologies.
Miller moved to Stirling in 1911, at 'Randolphfield', and died there on 28 November 1947.
Early life.
James Miller was the son of a farmer, and was born in Auchtergaven, Perthshire, in 1860. He spent most of his childhood in Little Cairnie, Forteviot, and was educated at Perth Academy.
In 1877 he was articled to the Perth architect Andrew Heiton, and on completion of his apprenticeship, he worked in Edinburgh at the office of Hippolyte Blanc. before joining the engineering department of the Caledonian Railway, initially in Perth.
Career.
In 1888, Miller was transferred to the Caledonian Railway’s drawing office in Glasgow, and designed a number of railway stations in the West of Scotland under the supervision of the engineer-in-chief, George Graham, and Donald Alexander Matheson, who was to become his successor. Notable designs from this period include the English-domestic style stations at Fort Matilda (1889), Troon (1892) and West Kilbride (1900), and the interchanges between rail and steamer at Gourock Pier (1889) and Greenock Princes Pier (1893). In 1892, having won the competition to design Belmont Church in Hillhead, he set up in full-time practice on his own account and rented an office at 223 West George Street, Glasgow. He continued to design for the Caledonian and other Scottish railway companies, including the distinctive 'chalet style' stations on the West Highland Railway in 1894, and the Scottish Jacobean-style St Enoch subway station for the Glasgow District Subway Company.
During the following 40 years, he won competitions and commissions for a wide variety of buildings including for the 1901 Glasgow International Exhibition, of which his Sunlight Cottages are the sole remains; in 1901 for the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, which resulted in a bulky and unpopular baronial-style design; and in 1904 for the Glasgow & South Western Railway’s Turnberry Hotel. He undertook significant work for the Caledonian Railway at this time, including extensions to Glasgow Central Station and its hotel (1900-1905), and Wemyss Bay railway station, with its circular booking office and curving timber walkway to the steamer pier.
In 1910 he won the competition to design the headquarters of the Institution of Civil Engineers at One Great George Street in London's Westminster, together with the adjacent matching extension to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, which were built of Portland stone in a neo-Baroque style.
An American influence began to appear in Miller’s work following a 1902 fact-finding visit to the USA by Matheson. An early example was Olympic House (1903), a plain rectangular speculative office development in Glasgow’s Queen Street, followed by the Anchor Line Building (1905-7) on St Vincent Place. The façade of this building is of white faience tiles, the first time that a Scottish architect had used this material. It developed further following the appointment in 1918 of Richard M Gunn as chief draughtsman and designer, which resulted in designs such as the McLaren warehouse (1922) in George Square, and the massive classical Head Office for the Union Bank of Scotland (1924) in St Vincent Street.
Miller’s later commercial architecture during the 1930s featured hints of Egyptian revival decoration and Art Deco, as seen in the Commercial Bank of Scotland (1930-1) at the corner of Glasgow’s West Nile and West George streets; and the last of his bank buildings, also for the Commercial Bank of Scotland, at 30 Bothwell Street (1934-5). Both these buildings used white Portland Stone to combat the effects of Glasgow’s polluted atmosphere at the time.
Major commissions beyond Scotland included Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys (1927) in Leicester, and the neo-Georgian style Dining Hall and ‘Cocoa Block’ (1929) for Cadbury at Bournville. His final designs were for long, low buildings such as the Glasgow & West of Scotland College of Commerce (1933) in Pitt Street, Glasgow.
Miller’s domestic work spanned his architectural career. Much of his early work, such as ‘Dunloskin’, Dumbreck (1890), and Craighuchty Terrace, Aberfoyle (c.1890) is in an English Arts & Crafts style and influenced by his railway architecture. Further commissions for houses in Glasgow followed as a result of Miller’s involvement in the 1901 Glasgow International Exhibition, including 8 and 10 Lowther Terrace, Great Western Road (1904 and 1910 respectively). Between 1915 and 1923, he designed ‘Kildonan’, near Barrhill, Ayrshire, for Captain David Euan Wallace MP, a very large property similar in size to Turnberry Hotel, and in a Tudor Revival style.
Miller died on 28 November 1947 at Randolphield, Stirling, which had been his home since 1911. His son George, one of three children, had joined the practice in the mid-1930s but died in 1940, at which point James retired.

Hereditary officers of the Roman Curia

The Roman Court or Papal Curia was reformed by the Bull "Pontificalis Domus" of 1969. This abolished the role of the old Roman nobility at the Papal Court with the exception of the position of Prince Assistant to the Papal Throne. These titles (such as the Grand Master of the Sacred Apostolic Hospice, Marshal of the Holy Roman Church and the Sacred Conclave, etc.) are now purely honorary (though still hereditary).
This position had been shared jointly by the Princes Orsini and Colonna, but the former was deprived by Pius XII after obtaining a divorce and the title was conferred upon Prince Torlonia, Prince of Fucino, Canino and Musignano of the Torlonia Family. 
The Prince Assistants are representatives of the Roman nobility, who serve "at the feet of the Throne" immediately next to the Cardinal Deacon who stands to the right of the Pope. They alternate office during their lifetimes and no-one can substitute for them. 
Their principal function is to serve on the occasion of official visits by a Head of state. 
The reforms of 1969 also changed the names and abolished the differing categories of Secret Chamberlains of the Cape and Sword to Gentlemen of His Holiness. Other offices were abolished altogether, but office holders were reassigned.

78 Records

78 Records is a music store located in the central business district of Perth, Western Australia. The store also sells DVDs, clothing and tickets to music and comedy events. Due to the history of the business, the large variety of music sold, and promotion of local acts, the store has had a significant influence upon local culture and the music scene within Perth.
History.
78 Records first opened on 19 June 1971 on the first floor of the Padbury Building in Forrest Place. Geoff "Hud" Hudson, John Hood, and John "Scruff" McGregor started the store to provide music that was unavailable from other outlets.
In its infancy, 78 Records boasted about 300 titles, all on vinyl and mainly imports, with a strong leaning towards blues but also encompassing an extensive range of other genres, though space was constrained as the store was housed in two small rooms. It was the three owners' love of the blues that inspired the store's logo, with its photographic representation of Blind Lemon Jefferson. The name 78 Records derives from the format on which his original recordings were released.
78 Records steadily expanded by providing customers with music that was hard to come by in the early 1970s, such as Rolling Stones "Sticky Fingers", Jethro Tull's "Aqualung" and Neil Young's "Harvest". In 1973, rumours started regarding the proposed demolition of the Padbury Buildings, which eventuated with the construction of Forrest Chase in the re-designed Forrest Place during the late 1980s.
In May 1974, 78 Records moved into what was essentially a tin shed next door to His Majesty's Theatre, Western Australia at 843 Hay Street, which has become affectionately known as "the old building". The increase in floor size enabled 78 Records to add a lounge area where customers could "lounge" in beanbags and listen to the music prior to making their purchases, the first such facility in Perth. 78 Records expanded its available music and started its tradition of an in-house band, the "West Australian Chainsaw Orchestra", theme days and the selection of the instrumental "A Walk in the Black Forest" by Horst Jankowski at closing time.
During the 843 era, 78 Records also earned a reputation which travelled much further afield than the metropolitan area, and visiting international performers frequented the shop in search of that elusive record they couldn't find anywhere else. Of course, some of them just wanted to check out how many of their own albums were in stock. Joe Cocker, Van Morrison, Elvis Costello, Bette Midler, Lou Reed and Elton John were just some of the artists that came back on their next visit.
843 Hay Street was proposed for demolition in 1987. Wanting to stay in the same area they had become associated with, 78 Records crossed Hay Street to number 884. In 1989, the Basement opened with videos, books, posters, comics T-shirts, and tickets for forthcoming events. 78 Records expanded from solely music-related items with the Basement developing a unique identity of its own with the inclusion of film, interactive media and cult writing.
78 Records moved again in March 1996 to 914 Hay Street, where it was located for 16 years. The first floor of this larger building has its own stage which is frequently used by local, national and international artists.
In 2012 the store relocated once again to upstairs premises above 255 Murray Street, with entry from a laneway off the Murray Street Mall. 
Awards.
78 Records won the ARIA Award for Best Independent Retail Outlet in Western Australia in 2007.

Leptosporangiate fern

Leptosporangiate ferns are the largest group of living ferns, including some 9000 species worldwide. They constitute the subclass Polypodiidae, but are often considered to be the class Pteridopsida or Polypodiopsida, although other classifications assign them a different rank. The leptosporangiate ferns are one of the four major groups of ferns, with the other three being the Eusporangiate ferns comprising the marattioid ferns (Marattiidae, Marattiaceae), the horsetails (Equisetiidae, Equisetaceae), and whisk ferns and moonworts.
There are approximately 9000 species of living leptosporangiate ferns, compared with about 300 for all other ferns put together. Almost a third of leptosporangiate fern species are epiphytes.
These ferns are called "leptosporangiate" because their sporangia arise from a single epidermal cell and not from a group of cells as in eusporangiate ferns (a polyphyletic lineage). The sporangia are typically covered with a scale called the indusium, which can cover the whole sorus, forming a ring or cup around the sorus, or can also be strongly reduced to completely absent. Many leptosporangiate ferns have an annulus around the sporangium, which ejects the spores.
Classification.
Leptosporangiates include the vast majority of extant ferns. Only groups that branched off early from the fern lineage, which retain a eusporangium, are not included. 
The classification scheme proposed by Smith et al. 2006 and Christenhusz et al. 2011 
Phylogenic relationships.
The following phylogram shows a likely relationship between the other vascular plant classes and the leptosporangiate ferns. It was formerly unclear about the relationship between Equisetopsida, Psilotopsida, and Marattiopsida, but recent studies have shown that Equisetopsida is most likely sister to Psilotopsida.
Discussion of Molecular Classification.
There has been some challenge to recent molecular studies, claiming that these provide a skewed view of the phylogenetic order because they do not take into account fossil representatives. However, the molecular studies have clarified relations among families that had already been thought to be polyphyletic before the advent of molecular information but that were left in their polyphyletic ranks because there was not enough information to do otherwise. The classification of ferns using these molecular studies, which have generally supported one another, reflects the best information available at present.

<doc id="9788210" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9788210" title="Kagura">
Kagura

Kagura (神楽, かぐら, "god-entertainment") is a Japanese word referring to a specific type of Shinto theatrical dance—with roots arguably predating those of Noh. Once strictly a ceremonial art derived from kami'gakari (神懸, かみがかり, "oracular divination") and chinkon (鎮魂, ちんこん, "spirit pacification"), Kagura has evolved in many directions over the span of a millennium. Today it is very much a living tradition, with rituals tied to the rhythms of the agricultural calendar, as well as vibrant Kabuki-esque theatre, thriving primarily in parts of Shimane prefecture, and urban centers such as Hiroshima.
History.
The epics "Kojiki" and "Nihonshoki" describe a folklore origin for the dances. In these texts, there is a famous legendary tale about the sun goddess Amaterasu, who retreated into a cave, bringing darkness and cold to the world. Ame-no-Uzume, "kami"/goddess of the dawn and of revelry, led the other gods in a wild dance, and persuaded Amaterasu to emerge to see what the ruckus was all about. "Kagura" is one of a number of rituals and arts said to derive from this event.
Originally called "kamukura" or "kamikura" (神座), "kagura" began as sacred dances performed at the Imperial court by shrine maidens ("miko") who were supposedly descendants of Ame-no-Uzume. Over time, however, these "mikagura" (御神楽), performed within the sacred and private precincts of the Imperial courts, inspired popular ritual dances, called "satokagura" (里神楽), which, being popular forms, practiced in villages all around the country, were adapted into various other folk traditions and developed into a number of different forms. Among these are "miko kagura", "shishi kagura", and Ise-style and Izumo-style "kagura" dances. Many more variations have developed over the centuries, including some which are fairly new, and most of which have become highly secularized folk traditions.
"Kagura", in particular those forms that involve storytelling or reenactment of fables, is also one of the primary influences on the Noh theatre.
Imperial Kagura.
The formal ritual dances ("mikagura") were performed in a number of sacred places and on a number of special occasions. At the Imperial Sanctuary, where the Sacred Mirror was kept, they were performed as part of "gagaku" court music. "Mikagura" were also performed at the Imperial harvest festival and at major shrines such as Ise, Kamo, and Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū. Since around the year 1000, these events have taken place every year.
According to the ritual department of the Imperial Household Agency, "kagura" still take place every December in the Imperial Sanctuary and at the Imperial harvest festival ceremonies.
Folk Kagura.
"Satokagura", or "normal kagura", is a wide umbrella term containing a great diversity of folk dances derived from "mikagura", and incorporated with other folk traditions. For the sake of brevity, a selection of traditions from the Kantō region will be used as examples.
Around the time of the beginning of the Tokugawa shogunate (1603-1868), performances derived from this emerged in Edo as a major form of entertainment. In connection with the celebrations surrounding the beginning of the shogunate, lion dances, acrobatics, juggling, and a great variety of other entertainments were performed on stages across the city, all nominally under the auspices of ""daikagura"". Over the course of the period, these came to be more closely associated with "rakugo" storytelling and other forms of popular entertainment, and still today, "daikagura" continues to be performed and to include many elements of street entertainment.

Jacob Paul von Gundling

Jacob Paul Freiherr von Gundling (19 August 1673 in Hersbruck - 11 April 1731 in Potsdam) was a German historian.
Court Historiographer to King Frederick I of Prussia, he became a figure of ridicule in the "Tobacco Cabinet" (Tabakskollegium) of Frederick William I.
Life.
Gundling came from a Franconian family. His father Wolfgang Gundling, who died in 1689, was a pastor at St Sebold in Kirchensittenbach near Nuremberg. Shortly before his birth the family fled to Hersbruck from marauding imperial soldiers. From 1690 to 1693, Gundling attended the Pforta county school in Naumburg, later studying law and history at the universities of Altdorf, Helmstedt and Jena as well as Halle. In 1699 he accompanied the Nuremberg patrician Jacobus von Tetzell on his travels to Holland and England. King Frederick I of Prussia appointed him Professor of History and Law at the Berlin Knights' Academy in 1705, and as historian at the Chief Herald's Office in 1706. The Chief Herald's Office was responsible for verifying the genealogical credentials of nobles seeking public office.
Gundling's position was, at first, an enviable one. Like many other foreign intellectuals he was attracted to Potsdam by Frederick I's lavish patronage and enlightenment ideas. He accompanied the king wherever he went, to supply him with erudite conversation, and was served food from his table. The king's dining room had had a sort of pulpit erected in it, from which Gundling, as royal newspaper reader, would expound on the topics in the news while the guests were eating.
After the death of the king in 1713, his son, the 'soldier king' Friedrich Wilhelm I dispensed with all of his father's cultured ways and abolished the Knights' Academy, but appointed Gundling to be his Councilor and historian. However his role at the Prussian court came more to resemble that of court jester, as he became the butt of many cruel taunts and practical jokes perpetrated by the King's rowdy and sometimes violent associates in the so-called 'Tobacco Cabinet'. Under the late King Frederick I, the Tobacco Cabinet had been a relaxed and informal social circle, including women, which ran on a convivial basis. His son Frederick William I maintained the institution, but fundamentally changed its character. It became an all-male society, whose members were mostly military men who gathered in sparsely-furnished rooms to smoke, hold discussions and drink to excess.
At sessions of the Tobacco Cabinet, court scholars would be brought in to give expert advice on some topic, and a discussion would follow. Often, the excessive alcohol consumption meant that these debates ended in physical fights for the amusement of College members. At these sessions Gundling was particularly singled out for humiliation. In February 1714, he was required to deliver a lecture to assembled guests offering arguments for and against the existence of ghosts, while being made to drink heavily. After his lecture he was escorted by two Grenadier Guards back to his room, where he screamed with terror at the sight of a figure moving around covered in a sheet. On another occasion, while he was drunk, his official Chamberlain's key was cut off his coat, and, in punishment for 'losing' it, he was made to wear a large wooden Chamberlain's key a yard long around his neck; He was invited to dinner and conveyed in a sedan chair from which the bottom fell out while it was moving, forcing him to run to keep up with the bearers, who paid no heed to his cries. A monkey, dressed as Gundling, was introduced to him as his own son, and he was compelled to embrace and kiss it. One night, in the middle of winter, when he was making his way home over the castle drawbrige, he was seized by four burly Grenadier Guards and dropped repeatedly onto the frozen moat below until his weight broke the ice, and he was ridiculed from above as he struggled in agony. Then the king left two young bears in his bedroom to terrify him. He frequently returned home to find his doorway bricked up, and on occasion the quiet of his study was shattered with firecrackers. In 1716 Gundling sought to escape his misery by fleeing to his brother Nicholas Jerome Gundlingius, professor and scholar in Halle, but he was brought back. Unauthorized departure from court was considered to be desertion.
Some three years after his attempted flight, Gundling underwent one of the cruellest jokes ever played on him. A man named David Fassman was his rival at court, and, after his death, was to take over many of his offices. Fassman had composed a vicious satire on Gundling, called 'The Learned Fool', which the king commanded him to present to the Tobacco Cabinet with Gundling present. Incensed by what he was hearing, Gundling seized a silver pan filled with charcoal which was used for lighting pipes, and flung it at Fassman's face, singeing his eyebrows and lashes. Fassman responded by using the same pan to beat Gundling very severely, and thereafter the two men repeatedly came to blows in the Tobacco Cabinet. Eventually the king commanded them to fight a duel. On the field, Gundling refused to fire and dropped his pistol, but Fassman shot at Gundling, though his pistol was only filled with powder. As a result, he managed to set Gundling's wig on fire, much to the amusement of the king's companions.
Evidently because of these continued humiliations he developed stomach ulcers, the pain of which he sought to deaden by further alcohol consumption. A second flight led him to Catholic Breslau, where he was offered a post - on the condition that he convert to Catholicism. Gundling refused and returned to Prussia under pressure from the soldier king. On 3 January 1720 he married Anne de Larray, the daughter of an aristocratic Huguenot, who had fled from France to Berlin by way of Holland. Court society correctly believed that the decision to marry was a move on Gundling's part to escape the constraints of his existence as the king's learned fool, or at least to establish a second, domestic aspect to his life in distinction to it, and therefore did everything possible to prevent the project. Satirical drawings and notes about the bride and groom were circulated, and Gundling's food was to have been mixed with a strong laxative before the wedding night. Gundling managed to escape this and other attacks planned for the wedding day by reporting himself sick, and having the marriage take place secretly and earlier than planned.
Despite these continued torments Gundling enjoyed, in the formal sense at least, high standing in Prussian public life. The King entrusted him with a number of high state offices, appointed him to the position of President of the Prussian Academy of Sciences and on 25 September 1724 made him a baron. He had a substantial income, horses, carriages and servants, and was able, in most respects, to lead a privileged life.
Gundling died on 11 April 1731 in Potsdam as a consequence of his ulcers. Even in death the king did not spare him humiliation. By royal command he had been compelled for a number of years to keep, in his bedroom, a coffin made from a varnished wine barrel, on which the following verse was written:
After he died, the king had his body paraded through the streets of Potsdam and then publicly displayed, wearing the outlandish costume he required Gundling to wear for his own amusement, propped up in the barrel. Various ribald songs were composed specially for his funeral, but the king's antics were so outrageous that the local clergy categorically refused to have anything to do with this parody of a funeral ceremony. Instead, the funeral sermon was delivered by none other than Gundling's long-time tormentor, David Fassman.
Work.
Under Gundling's Presidency of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, the Collegium Medico-chirurgicum was founded. Gundling conducted a systematic evaluation of the sources of the humanities taught in Prussian institutions, and the establishment of the Prussian school system was a project led by him. He was also responsible for the comprehensive mapping of Prussia, and between 1713 and 1715 he traveled extensively throughout Brandenburg to obtain information for his Brandenburg Atlas, which he completed 1724. In addition, he wrote and published a number of historical and biographical texts and in-depth descriptions of the countryside of Brandenburg and Pomerania. His work on Albrecht the Bear, the first Margrave of Brandenburg, contains the first known mention of the story of how Albrecht converted the Slavic Prince Jaxa to Christianity. He was also regarded as a highly influential figure at the Berlin court, who had a major voice in both the internal and the external policy of Friedrich Wilhelm I. The Austrian envoy to the Potsdam court, Seckendorff, complained to Prince Eugene on 23 October 1726 that 'no-one did the Austrians more harm than a certain Privy Councillor, Gundling, who, much against his will, was forced to act the part of a merry-Andrew, but who was always in the king's company; that he was looked on as an oracle "in publicis". Whenever Austrian affairs were being discussed, this man insinuated into the king's ear "falsa principia"; that he was worth winning by the present of a golden chain and a miniature of the Emperor.' Gundling was accordingly presented with a miniature set in diamonds.
Assessment.
English sources have tended to emphasise Gundling's supposed character flaws and misfortunes at the expense of his learned achievements. German sources take a range of views. All are constrained by the fact that the main extant source of information about Gundling is a one-sided diatribe, published four years after his death, by his hated enemy Fassman.
Until around the mid-18th Century there were fairly balanced judgments about Gundling. Goethe's great-uncle commented: "His published books, all of which are thoroughly written, are without much spirit. It seems therefore, as if the king wanted to make a learned man play-act to soldiers.". The "Nürnbergischen scholar-Lexicon" of 1755 states: "... but he was ridiculed all over the court. His contributions to scholarship nevertheless remain very great and his writings ... are held, without exception, to be thorough".
The more the Age of Enlightenment progressed, the less Gundling's work was held in esteem. By 1750 the Academy of Sciences was keen to distance themselves from their own inglorious history under the Soldier King, and stories about the arbitrary and vicious behaviour of their former President were not something they wished to preserve the memory of. In contrast a 1795 biography detailed the foolish, tragicomic adventures of Gundling, but his merits as a scholar hardly found mention.
This remained the standard approach until the mid-19th Century. After that, the view of Gundling changed again, in a double sense. On one hand, liberal historians re-evaluated the time before the Enlightenment: Gundling's scholarly qualifications were highlighted and the barren intellectual climate during the lifetime of the soldier king bemoaned. On the other hand, in the last third of the 19th century, Prussian historians tried to finesse away a view of history in which an ancestor of the ruling Hohenzollerns was responsible for the scandalous treatment of science in general and of Gundling in particular. In their version, the weak-minded court scholar basically had himself to blame for his own fate.
Up to the present day there continue to be attempts of many different sorts to do justice to Gundling, some of which concentrate almost exclusively on his vanity, his drunkenness and the resulting "fun" while others take a sharply differentiated, source-critical view, which brings his significant scientific achievements into consideration.

Rim Banna

Rim Banna (), is a Palestinian singer, composer, arranger and activist, who is most known for her modern interpretations of traditional Palestinian songs and poetry. Banna was born in Nazareth, where she graduated from Nazareth Baptist School. She currently lives in Nazareth with her three children. She met her husband, Ukrainian guitarist Leonid Alexeyenko, while studying music together at the Higher Music Conservatory in Moscow and they married in 1991, and got divorced in 2010.
Artistic philosophy.
Banna first achieved popularity in the early 1990s, after recording her own versions of traditional Palestinian children's songs that were on the verge of being forgotten. Many such songs and rhymes sung by Palestinian families again today are said to be thanks to Banna's work in preserving them via her recordings.
Rim Banna also composes her own songs and adds melody to Palestinian poetry. Her message is often focused on the suffering of Palestinians, particularly those West Bank. Her music is described as "haunting, emotional, at times bordering on kitsch." She describes her music as a means of cultural self-assertion: A part of our work consists of collecting traditional Palestinian texts without melodies. So that the texts do not get lost, we try to compose melodies for them that are modern, yet inspired by traditional Palestinian music.
In this way, Banna does more than mimic the traditional techniques and representations of the pieces she interprets. She blends them with modern singing styles because, Oriental singing techniques are mostly ornamental… But my voice is more two-dimensional, thicker. I try to write songs that fit my voice. I want to create something new in every respect. And that includes bringing people elsewhere closer to the music and soul of the Palestinians.
She performs live in the West Bank. She reaches audiences in Gaza, which Israel physically bars Israeli residents from entering, through live webcasts.<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHTRuo10CuM&feature=BFa&list=PLA97984849AC06870&lf=results_main> She performed her first concert in Syria on January 8, 2009 and also performed in Tunisia on July 25, 2011. Her first concert in Beirut took place on March 22, 2012. 
European audience.
"Lullabies from the Axis of Evil".
Banna's popularity in Europe began after Norwegian music producer Erik Hillestad invited her to participate on the CD "Lullabies from the Axis of Evil" (2003) and Norwegian singer Kari Bremnes, who also took part on this production in a duet with Rim Banna, invited her to Oslo. Banna accepted the invitation, and the two artists did a show together.
The album, dubbed "a musical antiwar message to U.S. President Bush from female singers in Palestine, Iraq, Iran, and Norway," brings these women together with others from North Korea, Syria, Cuba, and Afghanistan, to sing traditional lullabies from their lands in duet form with English-language performers whose translation allows the songs to reach a Western audience.
Mirror of My Soul.
"The Mirrors of My Soul", which was dedicated to all the Palestinian and Arab political detainees in the Israeli prisons, is a stylistic departure from her previous body of work. Produced in cooperation with a Norwegean quintet, it features "Western pop styling" fused with Middle Eastern modal and vocal structures, and Arabic lyrics. Though the style differs from previous recordings, the subject matter has basically remained constant. The album includes "songs of despair and hope" about the lives of "a struggling people, and even a song about late Palestinian leader and PA president Arafat in a way that is both thoughtful and subtle".

Automated species identification

Automated species identification is a method of making the expertise of taxonomists available to ecologists, parataxonomists and others via computers, PDAs and other digital technology.
Introduction.
The automated identification of biological objects such as insects (individuals) and/or groups (e.g., species, guilds, characters) has been a dream among systematists for centuries. The goal of some of the first multivariate biometric methods was to address the perennial problem of group discrimination and inter-group characterization. Despite much preliminary work in the 1950s and '60s, progress in designing and implementing practical systems for fully automated object biological identification has proven frustratingly slow. As recently as 2004 Dan Janzen 
updated the dream for a new audience:
The spaceship lands. He steps out. He points it around. It says ‘friendly–unfriendly—edible–poisonous—safe– dangerous—living–inanimate’. On the next sweep it says ‘"Quercus oleoides—Homo sapiens—Spondias mombin—Solanum nigrum—Crotalus durissus—Morpho peleides"— serpentine’. This has been in my head since reading science fiction in ninth grade half a century ago.
The species identification problem.
[[File:Daisy GTK+-Linu interface DFE.png|thumb|340px|thumbnail|DFE - the graphical interface of the Daisy system. The image is the wing of a biting midge "culicoides" sp, some species of which are vectors of Bluetongue. Others may also be vectors of Schmallenberg virus an emerging disease of livestock, especially sheep.
Janzen’s preferred solution to this classic problem involved building machines to identify species from their DNA. His predicted budget and proposed research team is “US$1 million and five bright people.” However, recent developments in computer architectures, as well as innovations in software design, have placed the tools needed to realize Janzen’s vision in the hands of the systematics community not in several years hence, but now; and not just for DNA barcodes, but for digital images of organisms too. A recent survey of results accuracy results for small-scale trials (<50 taxa) obtained by such systems shows an average reproducible accuracy of over 85 percent with no significant correlation between accuracy and the number of included taxa or the type of group being assessed (e.g., butterflies, moths, bees, pollen, spores, foraminifera, dinoflagellates, vertebrates). Moreover, these identifications, often involving thousands of individual specimens, can be made in a fraction of the time required by human experts and can be done on site, on demand, anywhere in the world.
These developments could not have come at a better time. As the taxonomic community already knows, the world is running out of specialists who can identify the very biodiversity whose preservation has become a global concern. In commenting on this problem in palaeontology as long ago as 1993, Roger Kaesler
recognized:
“… we are running out of systematic palaeontologists who have anything approaching synoptic knowledge of a major group of organisms … Palaeontologists of the next century are unlikely to have the luxury of dealing at length with taxonomic problems … Palaeontology will have to sustain its level of excitement without the aid of systematists, who have contributed so much to its success.”.
This expertise deficiency cuts as deeply into those commercial industries that rely on accurate identifications (e.g., agriculture, biostratigraphy) as it does into a wide range of pure and applied research programmes (e.g., conservation, biological oceanography, climatology, ecology). It is also commonly, though informally, acknowledged that the technical, taxonomic literature of all organismal groups is littered with examples of inconsistent and incorrect identifications. This is due to a variety of factors, including taxonomists being insufficiently trained and skilled in making identifications (e.g., using different rules-of-thumb in recognizing the boundaries between similar groups), insufficiently detailed original group descriptions and/or illustrations, inadequate access to current monographs and well-curated collections and, of course, taxonomists having different opinions regarding group concepts. Peer review only weeds out the most obvious errors of commission or omission in this area, and then only when an author provides adequate representations (e.g., illustrations, recordings, and gene sequences) of the specimens in question.
Systematics too has much to gain, both practically and theoretically, from the further development and use of automated identification systems. It is now widely recognized that the days of systematics as a field populated by mildly eccentric individuals pursuing knowledge in splendid isolation from funding priorities and economic imperatives are rapidly drawing to a close. In order to attract both personnel and resources, systematics must transform itself into a “large, coordinated, international scientific enterprise” 
Many have identified use of the Internet— especially via the World Wide Web — as the medium through which this transformation can be made. While establishment of a virtual, GenBank-like system for accessing morphological data, audio clips, video files and so forth would be a significant step in the right direction, improved access to observational information and/or text-based descriptions alone will not address either the taxonomic impediment or low identification reproducibility issues successfully. Instead, the inevitable subjectivity associated with making critical decisions on the basis of qualitative criteria must be reduced or, at the very least, embedded within a more formally analytic context.
Properly designed, flexible, and robust, automated identification systems, organized around distributed computing architectures and referenced to authoritatively identified collections of training set data (e.g., images, and gene sequences) can, in principle, provide all systematists with access to the electronic data archives and the necessary analytic tools to handle routine identifications of common taxa. Properly designed systems can also recognize when their algorithms cannot make a reliable identification and refer that image to a specialist (whose address can be accessed from another database). Such systems can also include elements of artificial intelligence and so improve their performance the more they are used. Most tantalizingly, once morphological (or molecular) models of a species have been developed and demonstrated to be accurate, these models can be queried to determine which aspects of the observed patterns of variation and variation limits are being used to achieve the identification, thus opening the way for the discovery of new and (potentially) more reliable taxonomic characters.
External links.
Here are some links to the home pages of species identification systems. The SPIDA and DAISY system are essentially generic and capable of classifying any image material presented. The ABIS and DrawWing system are restricted to insects with membranous wings as they operate by matching a specific set of characters based on wing venation.

Isocetane

Isocetane (2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane) is a highly branched alkane used as a reference in determining the cetane number of diesel. It is given a cetane number of 15. Isocetane replaced 1-methylnaphthalene as the lower reference for cetane number (1-methylnaphthalene has cetane number zero) owing to the expense of 1-methylnaphthalene, and difficulty in safe handling.

Ted Vibert was a politician in the States of Jersey from 1999 to 2005.
Biography.
Ted Vibert was born on 10 June 1938, at Grosnez, St Ouen, Jersey.
He went to the States Intermediate school, then was one of the first intake to Hautlieu School. He gained the Howard Davis Scholarship to University of Southampton.
He played professionally for three years for Leyton Orient, then went to Australia in 1969, and ran several commercial ventures there.
He returned to Jersey in July 1999, and stood for Deputy of St Helier No 1 District, gained a seat there (3rd place with 411 votes), but stood down at the 2002 elections, citing ill health. In 2003, he stood in the Senatorial by-election created by the sudden resignation of former Senator Ann Bailhache. He stood on a populist platform, saying that "It is obvious that there are two factions in the States those with a social conscience and those with none at all. I want to help redress the balance against those with a ‘gung-ho’ mentality who want to see more population, more building and more business activity.". He was elected a Senator, with 3,983 votes, after he narrowly beat former Deputy Alastair Layzell (3,712 votes).
He was active as a driving force in the formation and leadership of the Jersey Democratic Alliance, but ill health forced him to retire from the States in the 2005 Elections. In 2011, he resigned from the party.
He stood unsuccessfully as an independent in the St Helier District No. 3 constituency in the 2011 elections, coming seventh out of eight candidates for the four vacant seats.

Mei Ho House

Mei Ho House (美荷樓), formerly part of Shek Kip Mei Estate, Hong Kong, is the last remaining example a "Mark II" building in a single-block configuration. While the other buildings of the estate dating from the 1950s have been demolished, being replaced by new ones, Mei Ho House was chosen to be preserved.
History.
After a devastating fire in December 1953 that left thousands homeless, the Colonial government built a 29-block resettlement estate on the site of the burnt-down shanties to house the homeless victims. Eight blocks (Blocks A to H), later renumbered as Blocks 10 through 13 and 35 through to 41, were constructed with the financial aid of the United Nations (Mei Ho House is Block H, later Block 41). These 7 storey blocks were constructed in an 'H' configuration consisting of 2 residential wings, with communal sanitary facilities linking them.
During the Hong Kong 1956 riots, the building was used as one of the bases for the rioters.
Preservation.
The building will be tentatively preserved as a record of Hong Kong's public housing development. It was listed as a Grade I historic building in 2005 and as a Grade II historic building in 2010.
In 2008, it was part of the seven buildings of Batch I of the Hong Kong Government's Revitalising Historic Buildings Through Partnership Scheme. On 17 February 2009, the government declared that the building will be used by the Hong Kong Youth Hostels Association as "City Hostel". The capital cost of the project is estimated at HK$192.3 million. Estimated completion time is 2012. The hostel will also have an exhibition area with guided tour detailing the living environment of public housing units in the past.
Opening.
Mei Ho House Youth Hostel will be open for business from Thursday, 24 October 2013. A dormitory room with four bunk beds costs from HK$260 per person. A double room costs from HK$680 per night while a family room costs from HK$1,320. At the opening, Chief Secretary for Administration Carrie Lam described it as a "pioneering renovation project" for a public housing estate and "very meaningful."

DJ Friction (UK)

Friction (real name Ed Keeley) is a drum and bass DJ from Brighton, England.
Biography.
Brighton-raised Friction is one of only a handful of drum and bass DJs to utilise three decks to mash up his mixes, creating a unique sound. As a teenager Friction was busy playing and promoting events in Brighton when he began collaborating with local producers Stakka & K-Tee who were heavily involved in Andy C's Ram Records label.
In 1998 Friction released his debut single "Critical Mass" under the name 'Kinnetix', attracting the attention of major labels. Soon he was releasing tracks on renowned labels such as Valve, Tru Playaz, Trouble On Vinyl, 31 Records, Hospital, Charge and Renegade Hardware alongside his own Shogun Audio imprint.
Friction is regarded as one of the biggest DJs in the drum and bass scene, with an extremely fast rise to success in the last 5 years. Highly regarded for his various mix CDs and releases on labels like Hospital, Tru Playaz and Renegade Hardware. One of his biggest tracks was the "Back To Your Roots Remix" on Shogun Audio in 2007.
He is label manager of Shogun Audio, and was a regular DJ on the BBC 1Xtra D&B M1X Show. Friction is not to be confused with Birmingham based DJ Fricktion who specialises in Open Format Genres, or Bobby Friction of the BBC Asian Network.
Friction has had several collaborations with British singer-songwriter and rapper Example. Since Friction's 2011 remix of his #1 hit single "Changed the Way You Kiss Me", which was included on the iTunes bonus track version of his third studio album "Playing in the Shadows", Elliot Gleave's has become a writer for some of his songs, including 2012-13 singles "Led Astray" (with vocals by Takura) and "Long Gone Memory" (featuring Arlissa). This has also led to Friction's collaboration with English electronic musician Skream in the 2013 song "Kingpin" (featuring UK grime rappers Scrufizzer, P Money and Riko Dan from Roll Deep), as Example and Skream had been working together numerous times themselves.
On 10 January 2012, BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe made Friction's song "Led Astray" his Hottest Record in the World.
On Monday 2 April 2012, Friction started presenting his own drum and bass show on BBC Radio 1 on Mondays from 2am to 4am. The show has now moved to Sundays from 3am to 5am and is also simulcast on BBC Radio 1Xtra.

Kaiwharawhara

Kaiwharawhara, formerly known as Kaiwarra, is an urban seaside suburb of Wellington in New Zealand's North Island. It is located north of the centre of the city on the western shore of Wellington Harbour, where the Kaiwharawhara Stream reaches the sea from its headwaters in Karori. It is a largely commercial and industrial area and thus has little residential population. The 2001 New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings gave the suburb's resident population as merely 15. A recent housing development up the hillside towards Te Kainga has increased the resident population.
Kaiwharawhara contains some major transport infrastructure. Both State Highway 1 and the North Island Main Trunk Railway pass through Kaiwharawhara on their routes from central Wellington northwards. Just north of Kaiwharawhara Railway Station, the Wairarapa Line (including the commuter Hutt Valley Line) diverges from the North Island Main Trunk Railway. Due to its waterfront location, Kaiwharawhara also has shipping activity, with the Wellington Interislander Ferry terminal located on the boundary of Kaiwharawhara and Pipitea.
In sport, Kaiwharawhara was previously represented in soccer by Waterside, a club formed by dock workers in 1921. In 1988, they merged with the Karori Swifts to form Waterside Karori AFC.
Etymology.
In pre-European times, the area was known as Kaiwharawhara, which is Māori for 'food' (kai) and 'the fruit of the "Astelia" (wharawhara). Jerningham Wakefield during the 1840s commented that the stream was called after the "wharrawharra", and from this, the name was corrupted to Kaiwarra. The suburb (and the station) was renamed from Kaiwarra to Kaiwharawhara from 9 February 1951 by a decision of the New Zealand Geographic Board

Alastair Layzell

Alastair Layzell (born 28 June 1958) is an independent television producer who started his career as a reporter for Channel Television (the ITV contractor in the Channel Islands) and later served nine years as a deputy of the States of Jersey, becoming President of the Home Affairs Committee, President of the Jersey Transport Authority and Vice-president of the Planning & Environment Committee.
Biography.
Layzell was born and then educated in Jersey at Victoria College Preparatory and then at Hautlieu School. He helped found the island’s hospital radio service, in 1975, as a presenter and later producer of the weekly political programme Midweek. In 1977 he joined Channel Television as a junior reporter, then continuity announcer, before returning to the newsroom as a journalist. He produced and directed a number of documentaries for the ITV network including Summer 1940 (the story of the German occupation of the Channel Islands), Around Britain and The Dakota: 1935–1985 marking the fiftieth anniversary of the first flight of the Douglas DC3 airliner. From 1980 he was a regular presenter of the nightly news programme Channel Report and anchored the station’s coverage of the Budget and general elections.
In 1988, he left Channel Television to form "Colonial American" which, through its trading arm Colonial Pictures, has become one of Britain’s top 150 independent production companies (source: Broadcast Magazine annual survey). As producer and director his early credits included The Only Way to Cross: 150 years of Cunard (for ITV), The Best of Europe (for Discovery Channel USA) and Mansion: Great Houses of Europe – a series of forty programmes with Marcus Binney, architecture correspondent of The Times.
More recently he has written, produced and directed Art Deco Designs and In Search of Style – both with the actress Maureen Lipman – for UKTV and ITV, The Flying Picnic (with Annabel Croft) for ITV Anglia and Sky Travel, Garden Makers (presented by Joe Swift) London Visions with Peter Ackroyd (ITV/Sky Arts), and Peter Ackroyd's Venice (Sky Arts). He directed City at War and Legacy of War (ITV/PBS) jointly presented by veteran CBS newsman Walter Cronkite and ITV News anchor Alastair Stewart. The first of these looks at the reporting of the Second World War by correspondents such as Edward R Murrow, the second examines the post-war re-construction of Europe and the onset of the Cold War. For Discovery Channel he produced Britain's Greatest Ships (the story of the new Cunard liner Queen Elizabeth) and for Sky Arts the long-running series Auction. His latest work is in 3D. For Sky 3D he produced and directed Treasure Houses of Britain with Selina Scott, showcasing Blenheim Palace, Chatsworth, Boughton House, Holkham Hall and Burghley House.
In 1990 he joined Marcus Binney, President of SAVE Britain's Heritage, to save Jersey’s Government House from demolition. After a campaign which included a 10,000-strong petition and support from the Queen Mother and the Prince of Wales, the decision was overturned by the States and the house re-furbished. In 1991 he and Marcus Binney and Advocate Christopher Scholefield formed Save Jersey's Heritage to fight for the preservation of the island’s built heritage. Among their successful campaigns was the restoration of a row of 18th century cottages in the capital, St Helier.
Political career.
He entered the States of Jersey in 1993 as a deputy for the parish of St Brelade on an environmental manifesto Notre Ile: A Charter for Change. Among his first speeches was an alternative 'green budget' proposed on Budget Day 1994. As vice-president of the Planning & Environment Committee for six years he helped introduce a new planning law and Island Plan. As president of the Jersey Transport Authority he helped draw up the Service Level Agreement governing the operation of the island’s principal sea routes and represented the island in negotiations to protect Jersey’s so-called 'lifeline' air routes. As president of the Home Affairs Committee he steered updated legislation through the States including a new terrorism law, a revised firearms law (in the wake of the Dunblane killings) and a Police and Criminal Evidence law.
In 2002 he failed to be re-elected in St Brelade, losing out to political newcomer Sarah Ferguson by 34 votes. In February 2003 he contested a by-election for Senator (an island-wide mandate) but lost out by 200 votes to Ted Vibert. In 2006 he was one of the founding members of the St Aubin Anti-Reclamation Group which opposes plans to reclaim land from the sea for a car park in his old parish of St Brelade.
Aviation.
He has had a lifelong interest in aviation. In 1972 he wrote (with Michael de la Haye) Sixty Glorious Years: the History of Aviation in Jersey and, in 1987, Announcing the Arrival – to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the opening of Jersey Airport. He led a group of enthusiasts who bought, at auction in 1990, a four-engined de Havilland Heron formerly owned by Jersey Airlines. It now flies from its former home-base. In 1996 he founded the National Air Pageant and, as chairman, led the campaign to prevent the world’s last airworthy de Havilland Comet Canopus being sold overseas. It was saved for the nation by Defence Secretary Michael Portillo and now lies at Bruntingthorpe in Leicestershire.

Stob Coire Easain

Stob Coire Easain is a Scottish Munro mountain which reaches a height of 1115 metres (3658 feet), situated 18 kilometres east of Fort William. It stands on the western side of Loch Treig, along with its "twin", the Munro Stob a' Choire Mheadhoin (1105 metres). Collectively the pair are called "The Easains" or the "Stob Corries" and stand just one kilometre apart connected by a high col with an approximate height of 965 metres. The fine corrie of Coire Easain Beag lies in between the two mountains facing north west. Stob Coire Easain’s name translates from the Gaelic as "“Peak of the Corrie of the Little Waterfall”". This mountain should not confused with another Stob Coire Easain, a Munro “Top” on the Munro Stob Coire an Laoigh
The Easains stand in splendid isolation, hemmed in by valleys on three sides, giving Stob Coire Easain a substantial topographic prominence of 611 metres. The mountain is the highest point on a nine kilometre long ridge which runs the entire length of the western side of Loch Treig; the eastern side of this ridge drops very steeply to the waters of the loch. To the west of the mountain is the valley of the Allt na Lairig. A subsidiary ridge going north from the summit is initially steep and craggy as it descends to the head of Coire Laire. To the south of the summit the main ridge descends gently over Irlick Chaoile to the lonely country at the head of Loch Treig. All drainage from the mountain goes into the River Spean to find its way to the west coast of Scotland via Loch Linnhe.
Because of their close proximity, the Easains are usually climbed together with the best starting point being at the hamlet of Fersit () where there is room to park a number of cars on the verges. The north east ridge of Stob a’ Choire Mheadhoin is followed to the summit; it is then a steep descent and climb across the stony col to the summit of Stob Coire Easain. An alternative walk utilises the West Highland Line, with the walker starting at Corrour railway station and traversing round the head of Loch Treig to gain the main ridge of the Easains, which can then be crossed south to north finishing at Fersit. Stob Coire Easain’s height and isolation give good views with the vista west over the Grey Corries and the Aonachs towards Ben Nevis being especially fine.

Anthony John Allen

Anthony John Allen (born Anthony John Angel on 11 June 1934 in Torbay, Devon) is a British man who, in a widely reported case, was convicted in 2002 of having murdered his wife and children in 1975.
Biography.
Anthony John Allen had previously faked his own suicide in 1966 by “drowning” near Beachy Head, a popular spot for suicides in Britain. He was about to be prosecuted for a string of thefts and thought this would solve the problem. Instead of drowning, he swam around the coast and picked up some dry clothes he had stashed away earlier. He assumed a new identity, but this one wasn’t any more law-abiding than the first identity – he continued stealing, plus racked up more charges for bigamy and the murder of his wife and children.
In 1992, Eunice Chapman Yabley, who had had an affair with Allen, published an autobiographical book, "Presumed Dead" focusing on her relationship with Allen and the unsolved mystery. This led the case to be reopened eight years later in 2000. In the late 90's John Allen was appointed Manager of Cambridge Meridian Golf Club near the village of Comberton just outside Cambridge. Despite being pretty good at the job he embezzled money from the club and absconded when his misdeeds were uncovered. He was later found working at Ferndown Golf Club.

St Bartholomew's Church, Brighton

St Bartholomew's Church, dedicated to the apostle Bartholomew, is an Anglican church in Brighton, England. The neo-gothic building is located on Ann Street, on a sloping site between Brighton railway station and the A23 London Road, adjacent to the New England Quarter development. It is notable for its height – dominating the streets around it and being visible from many parts of the city – and its distinctive red-brick construction.
History and construction.
The Revd Henry Michell Wagner, who had occupied the position of Vicar of Brighton since 1824, died in 1870, giving his son, the Revd Arthur Douglas Wagner (the curate of St Paul's Church in West Street), the opportunity to continue and improve his father's proposals for new parish churches in Brighton. He undertook three such schemes in the 1870s, two in conjunction with his two half-brothers, but Saint Bartholomew's is the only church which was his sole responsibility throughout.
In 1868, Arthur Wagner had built a temporary church on Providence Place, a back street parallel with the main London Road, along with a school accommodating 400 pupils. After his father's death, he resolved to build a more impressive new church in the same area. The original plan, which was submitted to the Town Council in 1871 and approved on 7 June of that year, consisted of a combined church and school building, 322 feet in length, 46 feet wide, and 41¾ feet high. This was amended shortly afterwards to reduce the number of bays in the interior from 13 to 11½; the additional space formed a "courtyard" area between the church and the existing school building, which was to be retained.
Building work began on 8 February 1872; but Wagner's plans changed again, in favour of a significantly taller structure. When they were submitted on 16 September 1873, the revised plans reduced the length to 170 feet, but widened the building to 59 feet and, most significantly, proposed a height of 135 feet to the ridge of the roof. The cross on the roof at the south end (the liturgical west end) adds a further 9 feet to this.
Construction based on the new plan started shortly after its submission, and continued for 19 months. The official opening was on 18 September 1874, while building work was still taking place; and with entirely free seating throughout (for up to 1,500 worshippers) it became the first church in Brighton to offer universal free entrance from the date of opening. This was not welcomed by local members of the clergy, who had historically gained reliable incomes from the practice of "pew rents".
Architecture and design.
A Brighton-based architect, Edmund Scott, was commissioned by Wagner to undertake the design work—although modern interpretations of the modest nature of the work he undertook elsewhere in Brighton and surrounding areas tend to agree that he may have been directed and influenced extensively by Wagner, "a client who was prepared to disregard expense" on this project. Scott was not associated with any particular architectural movement, and worked alone on most of his projects, many of which no longer survive, although the Gothic Revival St Botolph's Church in the Heene area of nearby Worthing, built in 1873, remains an important example of his work. Two earlier examples of his less grand designs still remain in Portslade in the form of the Early English style St Andrew's Church, built in 1864 as a free and open church with no pew rents, and the original St Nicolas Church School, built in 1872 and now in use as an annex of Portslade Infants School.
Exterior.
The exterior appearance is unusual and severe, especially because of the building's height and the manner in which it towers above nearby streets of low-level buildings. Many of the houses and other buildings which originally surrounded the church have been cleared, accentuating the contrast. However, the slightly taller buildings of the nearby New England Quarter development now reduce the church's visual impact from some angles, especially as the land they are built on is at a slightly higher level.
High walls of reddish-brown brick, now aged to a purplish-brown colour, are topped by a steeply pitched roof with dark tiling. A mixture of red and black tiles were originally applied, but the roof was re-tiled in its present monochrome form in 1930. Running the length of the east and west sides of the exterior walls are a series of narrow buttresses with tall, pointed windows. On the south side, an unusually large rose window dominates the area below the apex of the roof, upon which stands a 9-foot gilt cross which brings the total height of the structure to 144 feet.
The building work was undertaken by a Brighton company, Stanning & Co., and cost £18,000 (1874 prices). This was in contrast to the £25,000 spent on St Peter's church around 50 years previously, under the supervision of Arthur Wagner's father, Henry Michell Wagner. The use of Portland stone on the latter added to the expense; the use of bricks for St Bartholomew's helped to reduce it, as did the abandonment of the revised plan's intention to build 11½ bays. (Only nine were constructed.) Additionally, the northern face of the church was never properly completed, and proposals for additional features such as transepts and a spire mentioned in contemporary publications were never carried out.
Interior.
Openness and a relative lack of division into smaller sections characterises the interior, giving an impression of vast space which is enhanced by the uninterrupted height: the church is effectively one large hall. Each side wall has several tall arches underneath which side-chapels are located, but these are well integrated with the nave. Above this is a shallow triforium, and above this, immediately below the roof line, is the clerestory with its tall pointed windows.
The interior walls are mostly made up of unadorned brickwork identical to that of the exterior. However, built into the northern end wall, above the altar, is a substantial cross, 30 feet high and built from Sussex chalk; and a set of carved wood and stone Stations of the Cross brought from Bruges in 1881 are located on the walls of the side-chapels. Also, the walls above the altar support a range of mosaics by F. Hamilton Jackson, a follower of the Arts and Crafts movement.
The High altar and sanctuary themselves are highly decorative, and are among a range of new features introduced under the stewardship of the Revd Arthur W. C. Cocks, who became vicar of St Bartholomomew's in 1895. Architect and designer Henry Wilson, who was the first editor of the "Architectural Review" magazine when it was founded in 1896 and who was also involved in the Arts and Crafts movement, was responsible for the work undertaken at this time, having been appointed in 1895 upon the death of Edmund Scott. The sanctuary is dominated by a 45-foot baldacchino in red and green marble, with a new altar below housing a silver tabernacle and a white marble shelf with a large crucifix and six candlesticks. In 1908 this was flanked by a pair of white marble columns bearing two further candles.
One of the side chapels contains a Lady altar designed in intricate "repoussé" silver on copper by Wilson in 1902. The High altar's original crucifix was moved to this altar in 1912, with a new crucifix of a different design replacing it.
Wilson designed and built a new pulpit, again in a variety of marbles, in 1906. Six red marble columns stand on a base of black marble and support a large block of green Irish marble, similar in colour to that of the baldacchino's marble canopy. At the same time, a large organ gallery was built at the south end of the church to house the organ and up to 150 choristers and orchestra members; and in 1908, a large octagonal font, again in green marble, is located in a recess on the south-eastern side of the church.
Wilson's association with St Bartholomew's ended in 1911, when Arthur Cocks left (having converted to Roman Catholicism) and his successor, the Revd Henry Ross, brought his own ideas in. Few of these were carried out, partly because of the disruption caused by World War I, although the mosaics above the altar were completed in 1912. The aborted plans included a second attempt at completing the north end, which was still unfinished; a subsequent third attempt failed to proceed because of a lack of funding, with the re-tiling of the roof being the priority at that time (1930).
"Tallest church" claims.
Many sources claim that St Bartholomew's is the "tallest church in England", "the British Isles", or a variation on this. This requires some clarification; many churches are taller when their spires or steeples are included, and even the tallest church – St Walburge's Church in Preston, Lancashire, whose spire reaches 309 feet – is exceeded in height by four English cathedrals.
However, St Bartholomew's lacks any form of steeple or tower, and the quoted height of 135 feet is therefore the height to the apex of the roof — with the gilt cross adding a further 9 feet. If towers, steeples and spires are excluded, therefore, the "tallest church" claim has greater merit. Similarly, when cathedrals are excluded and only parish churches considered, the nave is the largest in Britain. Nevertheless, comparative measurements are difficult to obtain.
Reaction to the building.
The stark and unusual design and the relatively opulent interior caused considerable controversy at first, especially among more reactionary Anglicans mistrustful of the Anglo-Catholic nature of Wagner and, by extension, his church. Musgrave (1981) notes that a letter written to a local newspaper in 1874, by a writer "who signed himself 'a true Protestant and no sham', expressed the deepest disquiet over such features as a certain 'dark spiral staircases... off which little and almost dark rooms, or cells... are built.'" The writer accuses these of housing nunneries or anchorites, and questions whether the building is indeed being used solely as a church. In fact, the staircases and "cells" are merely parts of the triforium.
A remarkable debate at the Town Council in 1893, at which it was reported that the overall height of the building was two feet higher than that approved in the plans of 1873, led to a further barrage of criticism. As the statutory fine for the planning violation was only 40 shillings (£2), it was considered irrelevant to impose it on the rich Wagner; but records of the debate indicate that a variety of derogatory descriptions of the building were made, including (as per Musgrave) "a cheese warehouse", "a Noah's Ark in brick", "a monster excrescence", "a brick parallelogram", "a huge barn", "uselessly large, painfully ugly and sadly out of place", and "Wagner's folly". (References to "Noah's Ark" are sometimes still heard today, mainly in relation to the shape and dimensions of the building.)
Additionally, residents of the houses formerly occupying the land immediately to the west of the church—where the London Road car park, St Bartholomew's school, and the eastern end of the New England Quarter stand today—complained to Wagner that the height of the church caused downward draughts of wind which caused their chimneys to smoke excessively. Wagner's financial resources allowed him to buy some of the houses and reduce the tenants' rents, in order to avoid continued objections.
The church today.
The church is a Grade I-listed building, meaning that it is a building "of outstanding or national architectural or historic interest". Its size gives it unique acoustics and the ability to accommodate large numbers of people, which have made it an ideal venue for classical and other music concerts.

The Kaiwharawhara Stream is a stream located in the North Island of New Zealand on the northwestern side of the national capital, Wellington. Its headwaters are within the suburb of Karori and it passes through other suburbs before reaching the western shore of Wellington Harbour in Kaiwharawhara near the terminal of the Interislander Ferry. For part of its length, it is roughly followed by the Johnsonville Branch railway, a branch line that was formerly part of the North Island Main Trunk Railway - the latter now passes over the stream near its mouth.
Its main tributary is the Korimako Stream, though it is also fed by other tributaries, and its catchment is roughly 19 km². Much of this area consists of parkland and other reserves, though it suffers from pollution in the form of stormwater and runoff associated with urban land use.

Richard Bryan (rugby union)

Richard Bryan (born 21 January 1977 in Bristol, Gloucestershire) is a rugby union footballer for Leeds Carnegie . His usual position is at the back row . The Tykes signed Bryan from Newport Gwent Dragons in May 2006 . He made his Tykes début against Nottingham R.F.C. on 1 October 2006 at Meadow Lane as a replacement in a 37-30 victory.
"I am very pleased to be joining Leeds after a difficult few months in Wales," said Bryan on joining the club, "This will give me a chance to restart my career and the club share a lot of my ambitions. 
"Next year will be a fresh start for the Tykes, with the amount of new players signing for the club and young players being promoted, and that is great for me. You cannot be anything other than very impressed by the set up here at the Tykes. 
"The calibre of player we are signing bodes well for next season and trying to get back into the Premiership. I realise I will be one of the more experienced players in the squad but I am looking forward to that challenge, at my last couple of clubs that leadership role is something I have enjoyed."
Bryan began his career with Bath Rugby before moving on to skipper Bridgend. At the Brewery Field he led the club to the last Welsh Premiership title before the introduction of regional rugby with 13 league wins in 14 games. He also played five times in the Heineken Cup .
With the introduction of regional teams he was drafted into the Celtic Warriors side along with former Tyke Richard Parks . He moved to Newport following the demise of the Warriors in 2004 and made 23 appearances in the Celtic League in two seasons. Bryan took over the captaincy duties from Jason Forster . 
In 2004 Bryan wondered whether he had any future in the game after clutching his knee in agony on the Rodney Parade pitch after falling awkwardly near the end of a game against Edinburgh .
A cruciate ligament had gone in the knee and a complete reconstruction was required with no certainty about the outcome. Ironically, it was fellow Tyke Rhys Oakley who replaced him in the Dragons' side.
But he recovered and he made a full return to the Newport side. Bryan said at the time: "The injury didn't even come through contact. I just sidestepped at the end of the game, right in the 80th minute, and it just went. I had never felt anything like it, I was in a huge amount of pain and felt pretty desperate.
"When I first did it I didn't realise how long it would be, maybe three or four months, so it was really hard. It was the longest I'd been out injured and it was a struggle watching all the boys playing, it was a case of trying to make the best of a bad job.
"But everyone at the club (Newport) was really good which helped me get through it, and I knew there were other players like Ben Breeze , Kevin Morgan and Peter Sidoli who had recovered from the same type of injury."

He served as the head ("imam") of the Shafi'i school of law at the mosque of Mecca ("Masjid al-Haram"). Many Indonesian Islamic reformist leaders learned from him, including Ahmad Dahlan, as founder Muhammadiyah and Hasyim Asyari, as founder Nahdlatul Ulama. .
Although Ahmad Khatib was an orthodox Sunni Muslim, he still hoped to reconcile the matrilineal system in Minangkabau with the laws of inheritance prescribed in the Quran. Through his Minangkabau students who studied in Mecca and well as those he taught in Indonesia, he encouraged a modified Minangkabau culture based on al-Quran and the Sunnah.

When challenged by the very much alive Leeds, Franklin insisted that Leeds had in fact died, but that he was being impersonated. When Leeds actually died in 1738 Benjamin Franklin publicly commended the impostors for ending their charade.

Judith Toups

Judith A. "Judy" Toups was a Mississippi-based birder and columnist for the "Sun Herald" of Biloxi for almost 35 years.
Born November 30, 1930 and raised in Gloucester, Massachusetts, Toups met and married sailor Jay Toups, a Mississippi native, in Gloucester, Massachusetts. She returned with him to his home state in 1965, the year he mustered out of the Navy. They settled in Gulfport and raised six children.
Her parents realized, on one of their visits to the Gulf Coast, that a stay-at-home mother of six young children needed a diversion. Thus began Toups' birding career.
In the late 1980s, Judy Toups rescued a sharp-shinned hawk from the front screened porch of a house in Bay St. Louis. The bird had barreled through the screen in pursuit of a squirrel and had been trapped on the porch, disoriented and unable to find the door and freedom. With only a quilt between her and sharp beak and talons, Toups dropped the bed covering over this formidable raptor, and ... carrying the trailing tails of the quilt, she carried the swaddled bird outside and let it go ([http://www.sunherald.com/mld/sunherald/news/local/16799114.htm]).
Toups founded the Mississippi Coast Audubon Society and advanced its conservation causes, including the high-profile protection program for terns and black skimmers. She taught Seashore Methodist Assembly elder-hostels and sent fledgling birders out across Coast terrain in search of native and visiting birds. 
She developed the Mississippi Coastal Birding Trail map, and wrote two books on birding the Gulf Coast. There is a trail named after her in Jackson County's Ward Bayou, and she was honoured by many birding societies. A portion of U.S. Highway 90 in Gulfport bordering the nesting areas she sought to protect was renamed the Judith Toups Least Tern Highway in early 2008.
Following the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, Toups relocated to Decatur, Alabama, where she died, aged 76, from undisclosed causes, on February 27, 2007.

<doc id="9788633" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9788633" title="Gatepost">
Gatepost

A gatepost is a structure used to support gates or crossbars which control entry to an area, such as a field or driveway.
Purpose.
If the gatepost is utilitarian in purpose then gateposts will be made as strictly functional structures; however as part of the 'advertisement' of the status of the family who live beyond, they are often carefully designed and constructed and sometimes highly ornate or individualistic. Gateposts give an additional element of character to the countryside and conurbations, significantly they also play host a habitat for many lichen, moss and liverwort species.
Construction materials.
They are often made of wood, such as old railway sleepers, telegraph poles or even tree trunks. For a longer 'life' more resilient iron girders or pipes may be used and concrete posts are sometimes employed. The older examples were often made of stone, such as granite, whinstone, sandstone or limestone. Occasionally standing stones have been moved and re-used as gateposts, especially on Dartmoor and in Cornwall. Bricks are frequently used and some are made from stones or small boulders, tending to be cylindrical in shape.
Stiles and stoups.
These are a form of gate which permits people through or over an entrance but which blocks the passage of animals. Branches or worked wood crossbars were used, one field stile gatepost with 'L' shaped grooves and the opposing stile gatepost with square concavities to receive the three or four horizontal crossbars. Most of these have long been converted to carry hinged gates, though one survives unaltered at the Museum of Scottish Rural Life, Kittochside on Wester Kittochside farm, East Kilbride, Scotland. They were sometimes made entirely of wood, such as oak, which is relatively long lasting.
The term 'Stoup' is used in Cumbria and some examples are elaborately finished, with dates and initials and even whole names, sometimes with the sort of flowing script more usually found on gravestones. One example is dated as far back as 1663.
The shape of the stile gateposts is variable, mostly being oblong and square in section, however some were 'tombstone' shaped, having two flat sides and a curved top.
Gatepost designs.
Ornate gateposts.
Many houses have driveways of varying lengths and gateposts are a way of making a social statement of status, through the cost implications of an ornate or 'awe inspiring' entrance way.
Some entrances had two or even three gates attached to the gateposts, such as at Robertland House in East Ayrshire, Scotland, the side gates being for the use of pedestrians. The gates themselves could be wood or more commonly cast iron, wrought iron or mild steel. A large number of the cast iron gates were removed by the Ministry of Works in World War II to be melted down and used to build weapons, etc. Once removed these gates were rarely replaced.
A sign of very high status was to have sufficient wealth to have gatehouses or lodges near the gates. Some estates had several lodges and the owners would at one time have employed people to live in these buildings and their jobs would be to open and close the gates, thereby controlling the movements of livestock and also of visitors, some of whom would be denied access or directed way from the front door to the tradesman's entrance.
The date of construction can often be deduced from the style, many being Victorian, due to the wealth creation of the period and the number of large dwellings consequently constructed. Large balls, looking like finials are sometimes precariously perched on top of gateposts, as at Woodway House in Teignmouth, South Devon.
Estate gateposts.
Country estates, usually having one owner, tend to show a degree of uniformity in the design of gateposts, which were mostly purchased at the same time. Different estates can sometimes be 'mapped' by the gateposts used, various designs being supplied for the different landowners to choose from. It may be that the same suppliers also made milestones for the turnpike trusts as the two are sometimes of very similar appearance.
Many gateposts have been removed to allow for the access of larger modern farm machinery, sometimes only one has been moved and the other left in situ.
Examples of Gateposts.
Examples of Gatehouses.
Eccentric gateposts.
Sometimes the personality of the builders of gateways are exhibited, for instance in Scotland it is not too unusual to find curling stones crowning a gatepost. Examples of gateposts with highly ornate railings are sometimes found outside new houses where they dominate the dwelling itself.

A compressed air dryer is a device for removing water vapor from compressed air. Compressed air dryers are commonly found in a wide range of industrial and commercial facilities.
The process of air compression concentrates atmospheric contaminants, including water vapor. This raises the dew point of the compressed air relative to free atmospheric air and leads to condensation within pipes as the compressed air cools downstream of the compressor.
Excessive water in compressed air, in either the liquid or vapor phase, can cause a variety of operational problems for users of compressed air. These include freezing of outdoor air lines, corrosion in piping and equipment, malfunctioning of pneumatic process control instruments, fouling of processes and products, and more.
There are various types of compressed air dryers. Their performance characteristics are typically defined by the dew point.
Water vapor is removed from compressed air to prevent condensation from occurring and to prevent moisture from interfering in sensitive industrial processes.
Refrigerated dryer.
Refrigeration dryers employ two heat exchangers, one for air-to-air and one for air-to-refrigeration. However, there is also a single TRISAB heat exchanger that combines both functions. The compressors used in this type of dryer are usually of the hermetic type and the most common gas used is R-134a. The goal of having two heat exchangers is that the cold outgoing air cools down the hot incoming air and reduces the size of compressor required. At the same time the increase in the temperature of outgoing air prevents re-condensation.
Most manufacturers produce "cycling dryers". These store a cold mass that cools the air when the compressor is OFF. When the refrigeration compressor runs, the large mass takes much longer to cool, so the compressor runs longer, and stays OFF longer. These units operate at lower dew points, typically in the 35–40 °F range. When selected with the optional "cold coalescing filter", these units can deliver compressed air with lower dew points.
Some manufacturers are marketing compressors with built-in refrigeration dryers, but these have had a mixed acceptance in the market.
Commonly a coalesing prefilter is installed immediately upstream of a refrigerated dryer to remove lubricating oil and other contaminants that have the potential to foul the dryer's heat exchangers.
Deliquescent dryer.
A deliquescent dryer typically consists of a pressure vessel filled with a hygroscopic media that absorbs water vapor. The media gradually dissolves—or deliquesces—to form a solution at the base of the pressure vessel. The liquid must be regularly drained from the vessel and new media must be added. The media is usually in tablet or briquette form.
Deliquescent dryers have no moving parts and don't require electrical power for operation. Common applications therefore often involve remote, hazardous, or mobile worksites. Deliquescent dryers are used for removing water vapor from compressed air, natural gas, and waste gases such as landfill gas and digester gas.
The performance of a deliquescent dryer, as measured by outlet dew point, is highly dependent on the temperature of the air or gas being processed, with cooler temperatures resulting in better performance.
Desiccant dryer.
The term "desiccant dryer" refers to a broad class of dryers. Other terms commonly used are regenerative dryer and twin tower dryer, and to a lesser extent adsorption dryer.
The compressed air is passed through a pressure vessel with two "towers" filled with a media such as activated alumina, silica gel, molecular sieve or other desiccant material. This desiccant material attracts the water from the compressed air via adsorbtion. As the water clings to the desiccant, the desiccant "bed" becomes saturated. The dryer is timed to switch towers based on a standard NEMA cycle, once this cycle completes some compressed air from the system is used to "purge" the saturated desiccant bed by simply blowing the water that has adhered to the desiccant off.
The duty of the desiccant is to bring the pressure dew point of the compressed air to a level in which the water will no longer condense, or to remove as much water from the compressed air as possible. A standard dew point that is expected by a regenerative dryer is −40 °C (−40 °F), this means that when the air leaves the dryer there is as much water in the air as if the air had been "cooled" to −40 °C (−40 °F). Required dew point is dependent on application and −70 °C is required in some applications. Many newer dryers come equipped with a dew dependent switching (DDS) which allows for the dryer to detect dew point and shorten or lengthen the drying cycle to fulfill the required dew point. Oftentimes this will save significant amounts of energy which is one of the largest factors when determining the proper compressed air system.
The regeneration of the desiccant vessel can be during three different methods:
Membrane dryer.
"Membrane dryer" refers to a dehumidification membrane that removes water vapor from compressed air.
Typically, the compressed air is first filtered with a high-quality coalescing filter. This filter removes liquid water, oil and particulate from the compressed air. The water vapor–laden air then passes through the center bore of hollow fibers in the membrane bundle. At the same time, a small portion of the dry air product is redirected along the outside surface of the fibers to sweep out the water vapor which has permeated the membrane. The moisture-laden sweep gas is then vented to the atmosphere, and clean, dry air is supplied to the application. The membrane air dryers are designed to operate continuously, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Membrane air dryers are quiet, reliable and require no electricity to operate.
Some dryers are non-porous, which means they only permeate water vapor. Non-porous membranes' drying power is only a function of flow rate, pressure. The sweep flow is strictly controlled by an orifice and is not a function of temperature.
Porous membranes are modified nitrogen membranes and pass air as well, usually changing the composition of the compressed air by reducing the oxygen content. The only maintenance required is changing the prefilter cartridge twice a year. The performance of porous membranes are dependent on temperature as well as operating pressure and flow.
Membrane air dryers depress the incoming dew point. Most dryers have a challenge air dew point and pressure specification. So if the inlet dew point is lower than the specified challenge air then the outlet dew point is even lower than specified. For example, a dryer could be rated at a −40 °F dew point with a challenge of +70 °F dew point and 100 psig. If the incoming air has an inlet dew point of only 32 °F, the outlet dew point will be somewhat less. Pressure also plays a role. If the pressure is higher than the rated specification then the outlet dew point will be lowered. This lowering of the outlet dew point is due to the longer residence time that the air has inside the membrane. Using the spec above, an operating pressure of 120 psig will yield a lower outlet dew point than specified. The extent of the improvement is dependent on the nature of the membrane and could vary among manufacturers.
Dew point suppression is not a feature of refrigerated dryers, as they chill the incoming air to a fixed temperature, usually 35 °F. So a lower dew point challenge will not yield a dew point lower than 35 °F.
Membrane air dryers are used in pneumatic components, spray painting, laser plenum purge, air bearings, air spindles, medical equipment, air guns and pneumatic brakes for vehicles and trains.

Medical Hypotheses

Medical Hypotheses is a medical journal published by Elsevier. It was originally intended as a forum for unconventional ideas without the traditional filter of scientific peer review, "as long as (the ideas) are coherent and clearly expressed" in order to "foster the diversity and debate upon which the scientific process thrives." "Medical Hypotheses" was the only Elsevier journal that did not send submitted papers to other scientists for review. Articles were chosen instead by the journal's editor-in-chief based on whether he considered the submitted work interesting and important. The journal's policy placed full responsibility for the integrity, precision and accuracy of publications on the authors, rather than peer reviewers or the editor.
The publication of papers on AIDS denialism led to calls to remove it from PubMed, the prestigious United States National Library of Medicine online journal database. Following the AIDS papers controversy, Elsevier forced a change in the journal's leadership. Also the thiomersal controversy, "the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years" was published here. In June 2010, Elsevier announced that "Submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Editor and external reviewers to ensure their scientific merit", suggesting that peer review is now in place.
Founding and editorship.
"Medical Hypotheses" was founded in 1975 by physiologist David Horrobin, who was the editor-in-chief of the journal until his death in 2003 as well as the head of the Schizophrenia Association in Britain. Horrobin was a controversial figure, a scientist and entrepreneur best known for his promotion of evening primrose oil as a treatment for diseases, leading the "British Medical Journal" (BMJ) to predict that he "may prove to be the greatest snake oil salesman of his age." Horrobin wrote in his inaugural editorial for "Medical Hypotheses": "The history of science has repeatedly shown that when hypotheses are proposed it is impossible to predict which will turn out to be revolutionary and which ridiculous. The only safe approach is to let all see the light and to let all be discussed, experimented upon, vindicated or destroyed. I hope the journal will provide a new battlefield open to all on which ideas can be tested and put through the fire." In its first edition, "Medical Hypotheses" published articles from its editorial review board member, virologist Frank Macfarlane Burnet, in vitro fertilization pioneer Ian Johnston, Gerald Kolodny of Beth Israel Medical Center, and Tom Tenforde, later chief scientist of the United States Department of Energy.
After Horrobin's death Bruce G. Charlton, a professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne and theoretical medicine at the University of Buckingham, became the editor, making publication decisions with the informal assistance of an advisory board. Horrobin had described Charlton as "the only person I really trust to take it over and run it in an open-minded fashion". Notable members of the advisory board included behavioral neurologist António Damásio, cognitive neuroscientist Vilayanur S. Ramachandran, surgical pioneer Roy Calne, psychiatrist David Healy, philosopher David Pearce, and the Nobel laureate Arvid Carlsson. Mehar Manku became the editor of "Medical Hypotheses" after Charlton was fired in 2010.
"Medical Hypotheses" was initially published by Eden Press. Elsevier has been its publisher since 2002.
Abstracting and indexing.
The journal is abstracted and indexed in the Science Citation Index, Index Medicus/Medline, BIOSIS, Chemical Abstracts, BIOBASE/Current Awareness in Biological Sciences, Current Contents/Clinical Medicine, Current Contents/Life Sciences, EMBASE/Excerpta Medica, Reference Update, and SciSearch.
Research.
The most widely cited article from "Medical Hypotheses" was published in 1991 by Ronald S. Smith in which he proposed the macrophage theory of depression as an alternative to the monoamine theory of depression.
Other famous articles featured in the journal include the proposal from Jarl Flensmark of Malmo, Sweden, that schizophrenia may be caused by wearing heeled shoes, and an article from Svetlana Komarova of McGill University positing that facial hair may play a role in preventing the development of cancer.
In what psychiatrist and "The Guardian" columnist Ben Goldacre called an "almost surreally crass paper", two "Medical Hypotheses" authors posited "mongoloid" as an accurate term for people with Down syndrome because those with Down's share characteristics with people of Asian origin, including a reported interest in crafts, sitting with crossed legs and eating foods containing monosodium glutamate (MSG). Correspondence items have presented masturbation as a treatment for nasal congestion. "Science" reported that a 2009 paper by Georg Steinhauser on navel lint "became an instant classic".
In 2007, journalist Roger Dobson published a book in which he collected and described 100 "Medical Hypotheses" articles called "Death Can Be Cured".
Peer review debate.
Horrobin began the journal in response to what he viewed as the limitations of peer review. He wrote, "The primary criteria for acceptance are very different from the usual journals. In essence what I look for are answers to two questions only: Is there some biological plausibility to what the author is saying? Is the paper readable? We are NOT looking at whether or not the paper is true but merely at whether it is interesting."
According to physiologist John Stein, Horrobin believed from his days as an undergraduate that peer review encourages adherence to currently accepted ideas at the expense of innovation. Also neuroscientist Vilayanur Ramachandran, who is on the journal's editorial review board, told "Science": "There are ideas that may seem implausible but which are very important if true. This is the only place you can get them published."
AIDS denialism papers and fallout.
In 2009, the journal's publisher, Elsevier, withdrew two articles written by AIDS denialists that had been accepted for publication. One of the withdrawn articles, written by Peter Duesberg and David Rasnick, claimed that there is "yet no proof that HIV causes AIDS" and was not responsible for deaths in South Africa that another paper had attributed to it and misrepresented the results of medical research on antiretroviral drugs. The publisher stated that the articles "could potentially be damaging to global public health. Concern has also been expressed that the article contains potentially libelous material. Given these important signals of concern, we judge it correct to investigate the circumstances in which this article came to be published online."
The withdrawal followed a campaign by scientists who criticised the articles' factual accuracy and the process behind their acceptance. A group of 20 HIV scientists and advocates contacted the National Library of Medicine to request that the journal be removed from the MEDLINE database alleging that the journal lacked scientific rigor and had become a "tool for the legitimization of at least one pseudoscientific movement AIDS denialism." Economist Nicoli Nattrass wrote in an article in "AIDS and Behavior" that ""Medical Hypotheses" has long been a source of concern in the scientific community because the articles are not peer-reviewed," and that the National Library of Medicine had been requested to review the journal "for de-selection from PubMed on the grounds that it was not peer-reviewed and had a disturbing track record of publishing pseudo-science."
As a result of the controversy, "Science" reported that Elsevier had asked that the journal's editor either raise the standards of review or resign. A review panel convened by Elsevier recommended that "Medical Hypotheses" adopt some form of peer review to avoid publication of "baseless, speculative, non-testable and potentially harmful ideas". Editor Bruce Charlton said that peer review went against the journal's 30-year history and is not supported by either him or the journal's editorial board. Elsevier reportedly told Charlton that his position would not be renewed at the end of the year, and Charlton said he would not resign. On May 11, 2010 Bruce Charlton announced on his blog that he "was sacked" by Elsevier.
Of the journal's 19 editorial board members, 13 wrote to Elsevier to protest the decision to change the journal's editorial policies. The group of scientists wrote that not having peer review "is an integral part of our identity, indeed our very raison d'être," and they would resign their positions if it was instituted. One of the members, David Healy of the University of Cardiff School of Medicine, said that the review board members' letter was "a defense of Bruce, not of the Duesberg paper." In contrast, board member António Damásio said that the paper should not have been published on the journal's website.
In June 2010, Elsevier announced the appointment of Mehar Manku as the new editor, and stated that "(s)ubmitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Editor and external reviewers to ensure their scientific merit. All reviewers will be fully aware of the Aims and Scope of the journal and will be judging the premise, originality and plausibility of the hypotheses submitted." Manku was previously the Editor of "Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids", another journal founded by Horrobin.

The Able McLaughlins

The Able McLaughlins is a 1923 novel by Margaret Wilson first published by Harper & Brothers. It won the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1924. It won the Harper Prize Novel Contest for 1922-23, the first time the prize was awarded. Wilson published a sequel, "The Law and the McLaughlins", in 1936.
A pre-publication notice described it as "a story of pioneer life in Iowa in Civil War times" focused on "a family of Scotch Covenanters." Some reviews praised the novel but viewed its prize-winning status differently. Allan Nevins called it "remarkable for the unity of impression produced" and added that "the book would win rapid distinction if introduced without its blue ribbon." But the "Boston Transcript's" reviewer wrote: "The book is so good as a first novel that it is impossible not to regret that it must always be judged as a prize novel." The "New York Times" was less enthusiastic: "Miss Wilson does quite well with her characters, develops them by phrase and incident. In the mechanics of story-telling she appears less practiced; or, perhaps, more labored. The novel does not always run smoothly from one incident to the next." 
"Book Review Digest" provided a summary:
Contrasting with the dramatic story of Wully and Chirstie is that of her father and stepmother, Alex and Barbara, a comedic tale of a wife "who thinks she is coming from Scotland to a castle on the prairie, only to discover she is to have to live in a 'pig's sty' of a house."
In 1936, "Time" called it "still her most noteworthy book."
Wilson's portrait this immigrant community has been cited for its folkloric detail, such as the story of Andy McFee, who removed his shoes when not actually walking until "an able grand-daughter-in-law urged him not to misuse shoestrings with such extravagance."

Torrens Knight

Torrens Knight (born 4 August 1969) is a Northern Ireland loyalist, who belonged to the North Antrim and Londonderry Brigade of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). In 1993 he took part in the Greysteel massacre (in which eight civilians were shot dead) and the Castlerock killings (in which three civilians and a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) member were killed). After being convicted—along with three others—for the killings, he served seven years in the Maze Prison before his release in 2000 under the terms of the Belfast Agreement.
Knight was part of a four man UDA group sent to conduct an attack in revenge for the Shankill Road bombing. Their target was the Rising Sun bar in Greysteel, where he, Stephen Irwin, Jeffrey Deeney and Brian McNeill shot eight dead (six Catholics and two Protestants). After the leading gunman, Irwin shouted "Trick or treat", he and Deeney raked the bar with gunfire, while Knight, armed with a shotgun, stood at the door. 19 other people were injured. McNeil was the driver of one of the cars used after the shootings. The attack was claimed by the "Ulster Freedom Fighters", a covername used by the UDA.
Knight was given eight life sentences for his part in the killings and a further four more for the killing of an IRA member and three Catholic civilians in Castlerock, County Londonderry. He served seven years in the Maze Prison before paramilitary prisoners were granted a general release under the Good Friday Agreement in 2000.
Allegations of being an informant.
According to David McKittrick, there had been rumours that Knight had been a police informer. Suspicions have been voiced by John Dallat, a member of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). Dallat, who said he was in touch with police about Knight before the attacks in Greysteel and Castlerock, claimed they might have been prevented since it was known Knight was an extremist.
In 2000 Knight attracted the attention of staff at a bank where he was withdrawing large amounts of money from an account into which £50,000 a year was being paid. The bank's concern was that Knight was involved in money laundering, but, when police were contacted, an assurance was given that everything was in order. The money was said to be from a Scottish engineering firm, but the account was quickly closed down.
The allegations of being an informer was investigated by the Police ombudsman Nuala O'Loan who eventually released her findings which showed no evidence of money being paid to Knight or that he was an informer.
Alleged membership of Apprentice Boys.
In 2008 Sinn Fein councillor Billy Leonard claimed that Knight was a member of the Kilrea branch of the Apprentice Boys. It was claimed that Knight took part in a parade in Kilrea and laid a wreath at the cenotaph in the village. The Kilrea branch of the Apprentice Boys denied this as did Knight himself. A spokesman stated that Knight wasn't a member and that they will demand an apology and explanation from Sinn Féin.
Knight also stated that John Dallat and Billy Leonard are taking part in a 'hate campaign' against him and challenged the nationalist politicians 'to get off his back'
2009 conviction.
In October 2009 Knight was found guilty of assaulting two sisters in a bar in Coleraine. As a result his early release licence was suspended and he was returned to jail.
He was later sentenced to four months jail for the assault. The judge said "The injuries sustained were consistent with a vicious attack on the two women and of particular concern in this case is that you kicked Ms Nicholl while she was on the ground, prone and unable to defend herself". He also said "People who do that can expect no mercy or sympathy from these courts. You acted as a bully when you approached these sisters. You lost control and lashed out".
After Knight was returned to prison in 2009 it was revealed that Trevor Collins, a member of Jim Allister's Traditional Unionist Voice political party, was collecting signatures campaigning for his release from prison. The TUV said it would not be taking action against the member to discipline Trevor Collins from Garvagh who instigated the petition.
Knight was released on 6 August 2010.

Unity Party (Israel)

The Unity Party (, "Mifleget HaIhud"), officially the Unity Party for the Advancement and Education of the Society in Israel (Hebrew: מפלגת האיחוד לקידום ולחינוך החברה בישראל, "Mifleget HaIhud LeKidum VeLeHinukh HaHevra BeYisrael") and originally known as Equality in Israel – Panthers (Hebrew: שוויון בישראל - פנתרים, "Shivion BeYisrael – Panterim") was a short-lived political party in Israel.
Background.
The party was formed on 11 November 1980 by Saadia Marciano. He had been elected to the Knesset on the list of the Left Camp of Israel, a union of various left-wing groups, including Meri, Moked, the Independent Socialist Faction and the Israeli Black Panthers, but broke away soon after taking his seat in 1980 (the Left Camp had two seats which were held in rotation by five party members). On 30 December, the faction was named Equality in Israel – Panthers.
In May 1981 he was joined by Mordechai Elgrably, who had been elected to the Knesset on Dash's list, and had joined the Democratic Movement after the party split, before leaving to sit as an independent MK. A name change resulted in the party becoming known as the Unity Party.
However, the party failed to cross the 1% electoral threshold in the June 1981 elections and subsequently disappeared.

Alexander Morus

Alexander Morus (or Moir or More) (25 September 1616, Castres - 28 September 1670, Paris) was a Franco-Scottish Calvinist preacher.
Biography.
More's father, born in Scotland, was a rector at a Huguenot college in the small village of Castres in Languedoc. In 1636 he left to study theology in Geneva, where he became professor in Greek in 1639. By 1648, he was professor of theology, pastor and dean of the Academy in Geneva.
He was an Amyraldist, and ran into trouble in Geneva where his orthodoxy was suspect. He was appointed successor to Friedrich Spanheim, but then was forced to leave Geneva.
He was working in the Netherlands in the 1650s. In 1654, John Milton launched a vitriolic attack upon him, in his "Defensio Secunda", in the mistaken belief that he was the author of an anonymous Royalist work containing a "rabid" attack on Milton, called "Regii sanguinis clamor ad coelum" (Cry of the King's blood to Heaven). Morus replied with "Fides Publica" in 1654, published like the "Regii sanguinis" by Adriaan Vlacq (also attacked by Milton). Milton then launched a second attack after Morus's reply. The true authorship of the "Regii sanguinis", written by Pierre Du Moulin, sent to Salmasius and only seen into print by Morus, came out in 1670.
He was professor of ecclesiastical history at Amsterdam from 1652 to 1659, and pastor at Charenton for the last year of his life.

Junin virus

Morphology and genome structure.
The Junin Virus virion is a negative sense ssRNA enveloped with a variable diameter of between 50 and 300 nm. The surface of the particle encompasses a layer of T-shaped glycoprotein extensions, extending up to 10 nm from the envelope, which are important for mediating attachment and entry into host cells.
The Junin virus genome comprises two single stranded RNA molecules, each encoding two different genes in an ambisense orientation. The two segments are termed 'short (S)' and 'long (L)' due to their respective lengths. The short segment (around 3400 nucleotides in length) encodes the nucleocapsid protein and the glycoprotein precursor (GPC). The GPC is subsequently cleaved to form two viral glycoproteins, GP1 and GP2 which ultimately form the T-shaped glycoprotein spike which extends from the viral envelope. [http://virology.ifas.ufl.edu/course/Arenavirus.ppt#285,14,Slide14]. The long segment (around 7200 nucleotides in length) encodes the viral polymerase and a zinc binding protein. It is spread by rodents
Epidemiology and disease.
A member of the genus "Arenavirus", Junin virus characteristically causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF). AHF leads to major alterations within the vascular, neurological and immune systems and has a mortality rate of between 20 and 30%. Symptoms of the disease are conjunctivitis, purpura, petechia and occasional sepsis. The symptoms of the disease are relatively indistinct and may therefore be mistaken for a different condition.
Since the discovery of the Junin virus in 1958, the geographical distribution of the pathogen, although still confined to Argentina, has risen. At the time of discovery, Junin virus was confined to an area of around 15,000 km². At the beginning of 2000, the distribution had risen to around 150,000 km². The natural hosts of Junin virus are rodents, particularly "Mus musculus", "Calomys" spp. and "Akodon azarae". Direct rodent to human transmission only transpires when contact is made with excrement of an infected rodent. This commonly occurs via ingestion of contaminated food or water, inhalation of particles within urine or via direct contact of broken skin with rodent excrement.
Prevention and control.
A investigational new drug (in US) vaccine (Candid1 ) was developed at the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Disease (USAMRIID) at Ft. Detrick, MD in the last 1980s which has shown to be safe, well tolerated and effective in reducing mortality and morbidity due to AHF.

Jacopo Poli

Poli Distillerie is an artisan Grappa distillery solely owned by the Poli family, founded in 1898 in Schiavon, near Bassano del Grappa, in the hearth of Veneto, Italy. The distillery is currently run by Jacopo Poli together with his siblings Giampaolo, Barbara and Andrea.
The raw material from which Grappa is made is the grape pomace, the skin of the grape, and what is left after the grape is crushed in order to make wine.
The Poli Distillery gathers the grape-pomace from an area that ranges from Bassano del Grappa to the hills surrounding Marostica and Breganze, lands historically famous for the cultivation of grape vines and for the production of Grappa.
Poli Distillery distill exclusively fresh grape-pomace coming from the wineries of the area. The still is among the oldest in use today. It consists of cauldrons completely made of copper, as in centuries gone by. The distillation cycle is discontinuous. This means that the grape-pomace is put into the cauldrons and distilled using steam; after about three hours the cauldrons are unloaded and the cycle begins again. Visitors are welcome by appointment.
In Bassano del Grappa, in front of the historic wooden bridge "Ponte Vecchio", the Poli Distillery created the Poli Grappa Museum, where the history of distillation and the history of Grappa are illustrated with efficacy in a small but suggestive area, by means of a brief but detailed educational tour.

Archer Grand Prix cycle race

The Archer Grand Prix cycle race is part of the British Cycling Premier Calendar.
History.
The Archer Grand Prix has been run annually for over fifty years, organised by Stuart Benstead of the Archer Road Club (although Stuart Cook organised the last two events in 2006 and 2007). It has been descried by British Cycling as a "long running classic". The first edition was held in 1956 and won by British rider, Alfred Howling. 1968 saw the first non-British winner when Jan Krekels of the Netherlands won the race. The race has in the past, adopted the name of its main sponsor, including Harp, Pernod and Cycling Weekly.
Consistently routed around the roads and lanes of the Chiltern Hills, the most recent route is split into a large and small circuit. The large circuit takes in Whiteleaf Hill and Hughenden Valley while the small finish circuit includes the finish at Winchmoor Hill. 
The 2007 edition was won by Simon Gaywood riding for the Plowman Craven Associates team from Matt Talbot (Rapha Condor) and Andy Roche (Pinarello). The 53rd version of the race was scheduled to run in Spring 2008 but had to be cancelled because of policing issues. The future of the race now seems uncertain. The race was scheduled to be held again on 19 April 2009, but sponsorship problems led to a second cancellation.

Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht (V&R) is a scholarly publishing house based in Göttingen, Germany. It was founded in 1735 by (1700-1750) in connection with the establishment of the Georg-August-Universität in the same city.
After Abraham Vandenhoeck's death in 1750, his English-born widow, "Anna Vandenhoeck", née Parry (d. 1787) successfully continued the business together with "Carl Friedrich Günther Ruprecht" (born 1730), who had entered the business as an eighteen-year-old apprentice in 1748. At the death of Anna Vandenhoeck in 1787, Ruprecht took over the business which he led until his death in 1816, when he was succeeded by his then 25-year-old son Carl August Adolf Ruprecht (1791-1861). The management of the company remained in the hands of the Ruprecht family for seven generations.
The traditional core areas of the publications of V&R are Theology and Religion, History, Ancient History, Philosophy and Philology. Current production also includes schoolbooks and non-academic publications.
In 1935, the Göttingen Academy of Sciences gave Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht responsibility for its publications. These include the "Abhandlungen der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen", the "Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen", and the "Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen", the last of which is the oldest academic journal in the German-language area.
During the Nazi period, V&R published the journal "Junge Kirche" ("Young Church"), the mouthpiece of the anti-Nazi Protestant movement Confessing Church. The periodical was shut down by the authorities in 1941; for the rest of World War II, the company was forced to limit its publishing to philology, natural sciences and text books for school teaching. After the war, it went back to its earlier ambitions to be a comprehensive academic press.

Silesian architecture

Silesian architecture is the name given to the constructions made in Silesia throughout time, and those by Silesian architects worldwide. The name is also applied to buildings made within its geographical limits before the constitution of Silesia as a duchy (earlier than 1172) or before this name was given to those territories, and largely depends on the historical moment. Due to historic, geographic and generational diversity, Silesian architecture has known a host of influences.
Romanesque (late 10th – early 13th century).
The Romanesque art in Silesia appeared with the Christianization of the region. The first known structure, relics of a church on Ostrów Tumski in Wrocław (Breslau), was built in the mid-10th century. Around 1000 Bolesław I of Poland founded a three-nave cathedral on the same place, styled after the cathedral in Gniezno. Few other buildings of that time are known. The rotunda in Cieszyn (Teschen), of Moravian- Bohemian origin, dates back to 1050.
The 12th century was a time of great advancement. The first monasteries and minsters, in Wrocław and Lubiaz (Leubus), were built, and the quality of work improved significant, as the builders adopted architectural styles from Southern Germany and Meuse. Outstanding achievements of this era were the cathedral and the abbey church of the Benedictine order in Wrocław, the latter being the most magnificent romanesque building in Silesia. It was planned after its mother church in Tyniec near Kraków, whereas its Westwork was influenced by Thuringian traditions. The church of the first Cistercian monastery in Lubiaz, built by monks from Pforta in Thuringia, was the first of many building made of brick in Silesia.
The beginning of the 13th century was marked by a big increase in building activity, caused by the large influx of German settlers (Ostsiedlung). Most of the municipal churches in Silesia, built of stone or brick, emerged at that time. Examples were Głogów (Glogau), Nysa (Neisse), Jelenia Góra (Hirschberg) or Ziębice (Münsterberg). These late- romanesque Silesian churches were a mix of local, Saxon-Thuringian and Bohemian traditions. Interestingly there are only 7 known examples of that in time Upper Silesia, but 67 in Lower Silesia, including secular buildings.
Gothic (early 13th – early 16th century).
The heralds of Gothic architecture were connected with the building activities of the Cistercians and the patronage of Henry I the Bearded. Two monasteries, in Trzebnica (Trebnitz) and in Henryków (Heinrichau), as well as two residences, in Wrocław and Legnica (Liegnitz), were early examples and referred to architectonical standards in Southern Germany and along the Rhine. They probably indicate to the dynastic connection between Henry I. and the House of Andechs. Characteristic attributes of all these buildings were the combination of brick constructions and details made of stone, which were most likely brought in via Altzella in Saxony.
The Tatar invasions of 1241 led to the decentralization of Silesia. Baronial patronage decreased whereas episcopal and later municipal patronage increased. The most important construction project of that time was the cathedral of Wrocław, which became the first pure Gothic building in Silesia. The chapel St. Hedwig in Trzebnica was another important structure of that era. Both building cited early French traditions, imported via Saxony, Bohemia and Austria. Most mendicant orders built their monasteries in the second half of the 13th century, most notably in Wrocław, Głogów, Brzeg and Strzelin. At the same time the first hall churches appeared. The most original were in Ziębice and Goldberg (Złotoryja).
Silesia's towns needed approximately 50 years after foundation to get their independence. In the 14th century, many of these towns began to build their own big parish churches, and with the assistance of the new Bohemian sovereign a dynamic sacral development program began. Dominant were now Bohemian, Moravian, Southern German and Lower Austrian architectural traditions, but mixed with local traditions which preferred more simple forms. The most characteristic creation of the entire 14th century remained the basilical municipal church with a long nave and no transept. This style was most probably derived from the Cistercian abbey in Zlatá Koruna (Goldenkron) in Bohemia. Although Silesia was now a part of Bohemia, a state of the Holy Roman Empire, the Parler Gothic had almost no influence. Architectural embellishments can only be found in three churches, probably all built by master builder Claus Brynner.
This dynamic sacral development program lasted the entire 14th century, and starting at around 1370 many bigger cities added guild and family chapels to their parish churches. At the end of the century, all monastery construction projects ended, and with the spreading of the Hussite Wars to Silesia most building activities were greatly reduced.
The expansion of the town hall in Breslau after 1480 marked a big change in the architectural history of Silesia. As it was obvious that local workshops, represented by Hans Berthold, could not meet the expectations, the city decided to invite experts from Saxony and Lusatia around master builder Paul Preusse. At the beginning of the new century, this influence from Saxony and Lusatia was most notably in western parts of Silesia, where Conrad Pflüger and Wendel Roskopf from Görlitz built city halls and churches in Löwenberg (Lwówek Śląski), Bunzlau (Bolesławiec), Sagan (Żagań) or Gröditzberg (Grodziec), all in the tradition of Benedikt Ried from Prague. Later Lucas Schleierweber from Schweidnitz (Świdnica) continued this Görlitz style and constructed buildings in other parts of Middle Silesia.
Renaissance and Mannerism (early 16th – 17th century).
The Renaissance era began with the accession of Johann V. Thurzó as bishop of Breslau. As a great patron of the arts he introduced the new style in Silesia as he commissioned two foundations plates (1505, 1509) at his residence in Jauernig (Javornik, today in the Czech Republic) and the sacristy portal (1517) on the cathedral in Breslau. The latter was probably made by a local artist, whereas most other early Renaissance projects were carried out by Italians from Ticino, the so-called ""Comasks"". The most successful were members of the Parr family (Pahr, Bahr or Pario), which built the fortifications in Bolkenhain (Bolków) in 1539 and later worked in Brieg.
The oldest preserved Renaissance buildings today are house ""To the golden crown"" (1521–28) in Breslau and the castle of Charles I, Duke of Münsterberg-Oels in Frankenstein (Ząbkowice Śląskie), built after 1524 by Benedikt Ried. Many buildings of that time still showed the transition from Gothic to Renaissance, for instance the castle in Wohnwitz (Wojnowice) or the city halls in Bunzlau, Löwenberg and Gröditzberg. Most of these buildings were probably built by Wendel Roskopf, a pupil of Benedikt Ried and author of a collection of exceptional Renaissance houses in Görlitz. He probably also was the constructor of Palais Rybisch in Breslau, which was completed by an unnamed Italian artist after 1526.
The high building activity in the Middle Ages resulted in cities which were saturated with churches. Only in exceptional cases new churches were planned, for instance St. Blasius (today St. Maria) in Ohlau (Oława), carried out by Bernhard Niuron in 1587. At that time most Silesian churches became Protestant and the interest shifted to small alterations of church interiors. A great exception was the conversion of the medieval church in Rothsürben (Żórawina) by Hans Schneider, which resulted in one of the best examples of Protestant ecclesiastical architecture in Middle Europe.
Much more coherent was the development of secular buildings. The first homogeneous Renaissance building was the gate of Liegnitz castle, built 1533 by Georg von Amberg. The highlight of Silesian architecture of that time however represented Brieg castle and his castle gate, which is deemed to be the symbol of Silesian Renaissance. It was built between 1544–70 by Franziskus Parr, the figurative architectural sculptures, the biggest ensemble in Silesia, were carried out by Saxon master Andreas Walther d.Ä.. It depicts George II of Brieg, his wife Barbara von Brandenburg and his line of ancestors. It was most probably modeled after Dresden's Georgenhof, which Parr visited in 1530, and Italian designs.
Similar buildings soon followed in Falkenberg (Niemodlin), Kreppelhof in Landeshut (Kamienna Góra), Sorau (Żary) and Plagwitz (Plakowice). Sgraffito appeared first in 1563 in Proskau (Proszków), altogether 300 examples are preserved to this day.
Stylistically the early buildings were connected to Bohemian and Lusatian traditions, represented by Wendel Roskopf, Benedikt Ried and Hans Lindener and were still influenced by Gothic ideas. Soon afterwards the buildings of the "Comasks" from Italy replaced their work. After 1560 Dutch Renaissance styles, imported by pattern-books and master builders like Hans Vredeman de Vries, replaced Italian elements. These Dutch forms were first visible at Oels (Oleśnica) castle in 1542. Notable representatives of this era were Gaspare Cuneo, Gerhardt von Amsterdam and Hans Lucas. Buildings influenced by this style were the castles in Alt Warthau (Warta Bolesławiecka) or Gießmanndorf (Gościszów) and the majority of the civic architecture of that time. Sporadically, other traditions emerged too, for example Saxon portals in Liegnitz or Bohemian roofs in Grafenort (Gorzanów) castle.
The only new development of sacred architecture in Silesia which fully adopted Mannerism was the palace chapel of Gmina Siedlisko (Carolath), commissioned by Valentin von Säbisch. His son Albrecht created the famous Protestant Churches of Peace, which were constrained by political conditions. Without tower, timber framed and built in minimal time they appeared more like commercial construction, a sparse look which was intended. In their simplicity they resembled on northern European Manierism, however they already were a creation of the baroque era.
Baroque (middle 17th – second half 18th century).
The beginning and the end of the Baroque were marked by two wars, the Thirty Years' War and the Seven Years' War. The triumph of the Baroque architecture in Silesia was closely connected to the rise of the House of Habsburg and the Counter-Reformation, whereas its decline was marked by the import of Classicism by Prussia, the new owner of Silesia after the Seven Years' War. The religious antagonism of Protestantism and Catholicism led to a sharp contrast of a conservative Protestant Baroque which was in the defence and a vanguard and rousing Catholic Baroque which was in the offensive. The ban to build Protestant churches and the saturation of the region with secular architecture resulted in a decline of building projects. As a consequence most Baroque palaces of the 17th and 18th century were alterations of existing structures. 
The destruction of the secular courtly culture by the new Polish owners after 1945 led to a widespread deterioration of palaces in Silesia, and today's remaining palaces and holdovers in museums give only a distorted impression of the Baroque era in Silesia.
Important patrons of the Baroque architecture were two bishops from Breslau: Frederick of Hesse-Darmstadt and Franz Ludwig von Pfalz-Neuburg. During their 50-year incumbency both initiated numerous artistic projects and supported a large array of artists. Cistercian monasteries with their large possession acted as important intellectual and artistic centers, and Cistercian abbots used the arts as an instrument to manifest their prince-like status. They created the conditions for a collaboration of the two workshops of Michael Willmann and Matthias Steinl, which was of pan-European importance. The Jesuits as the main supporters of the imperial Counter-Reformation enriched mainly the civic centers with their buildings, much to the aversion of the Protestant society. They were responsible for the spread of basilicas modeled after Il Gisu, stylistic vocabulary of the Bohemian Dientzenhofer family and the baroque theatricalism found for instance at Leopoldina university in Breslau. Artistically very active were also the Premonstratensians, Augustinians, Franciscans and the Benedictines, the latter being responsible for the church at Wahlstatt (Legnickie Pole) near Liegnitz, an outstanding architectural monument and one of the most famous symbols of the triumph of the church against nonbelievers. 
The privileged higher Catholic nobility, often immigrated, at that time laid the base for large possessions, whereas the Protestant bourgeoisie lost its role as a patron of the architecture and compensated this loss with outstanding achievents in literature, music and science.
Characteristic for the baroque era in Silesia was the glorification of the died out Silesian Piasts and its successors, the Habsburgs. The mother of the last ruling duke of the Silesian Piasts, princess Louise of Anhalt-Dessau, built a Piast mausoleum in Liegnitz commemorating the extinct dynasty, which shows a unique program by poet Daniel Casper von Lohenstein. The Cistercians regarded themselves as keepers of the Piastic legacy and erected commemorating programs in Leubus and Grüssau, but also rendered homage to the Habsburgs at the university of Breslau, in Leubus and in Lobris.
The early period of the baroque era (1640–80) was marked by the activity of Italian masters, which after the Thirty Years' War filled the gaps in the entire Holy Roman Empire. St. Matthias in Breslau (1654) and Cistercian churches like Grüssau (1670) were first altered, later it affected all churches. The first remodeled palaces (all around 1640) were the residences in Zülz (Biała Prudnicka), Żyrowa, Oberglogau (Głogówek), Palais Heberstein in Grafenort] (Gorzanów) by Carlo Lurago (1653–57) and the palace in Proskau (Prószków) by G. Seregni between 1677-83. The palace in Sagan, started by Albrecht von Wallenstein and later in possession of the von Lobkowicz family, was modeled after Bohemian standards. The Jesuit seminar in Neisse (1656–58) was built by Melchior Werner, who represented the first generation of Silesian architects after the war.
Important for the Protestant European architecture were the three Churches of Peace in Glogau, Jauer and Schweidnitz. Its constructor, military engineer Albrecht von Säbisch from Breslau, had to deal with a number of political constraints defined at the Peace of Westphalia. The churches should be built outside of the city walls, without stones and without a tower. The result were churches designed after Dutch and French examples, but with local traditions. A second variant of Protestant churches were so called "border churches", simple buildings made of cheap materials, located outside of the borders of Silesia in the surrounding countries and used as refuges for the suppressed Silesian Protestants.
Between 1680 and 1740 the Silesian baroque entered a period of prosperity. The palace in Suhlau (Sułów), built in 1680, was the first building made with all representative stylistic elements of the baroque era. The Althans family constructed several palace ensembles in Wölfelsdorf (Wilkanów) and Mittelwalde, Konrad Ernst Maximilian von Hochberg expanded castle Fürstenstein (1718–25, carried out by F. A. Hammerschmidt and F. A. Scheffler), 10 years later Martin Frantz enlarged Kotzenau palace (Chocianów) and created one of the finest baroque garden in Silesia, and even some "Palais entre cour et jardin" emerged in Gröditzberg and Briese (by Johann Blasius Peintner from Austria). Entire landscape gardens however are rarely preserved and only known thanks to illustrations by Friedrich Bernhard Werner.
After 1680 all great Silesian monasteries were altered. Of special importance here is the abbey of Leubus with its famous representation rooms by Michael Willmann, F.A. Scheffler, Ph. Chr. Bentum and Franz Joseph Mangoldt. St. Elisabeth chapel at the cathedral of Breslau was the most significant import of Italian inspired baroque and the last major work carried out by Italians. 30 years later Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach created the pendant, the electors chapel, which already anticipated neo-classical ideas.
The ideas of the Bohemian Baroque were spread by members of the Dientzenhofer family and its students. The first church of this type was the Jesuit church in Liegnitz, built by Christoph and Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer between 1714 and 1727. Later works can be found in Neisse, Liebenthal (Lubomierz), Leubus or Brieg. They were mostly propagated by Silesian Christoph Hackner from Jauer, Martin Frantz from Reval/Tallinn and his students Karl Martin Frantz and Johann Innocenz Töpper.
A reason for the intensified construction activity in the first half of the 18th century was the implementation of the "Treaty of Altranstädt", which demanded the restitution of 104 and the erection of 6 new Protestant churches, the so-called "Gnadenkirchen" (churches of mercy). The abolishment of building regulation except for the erection outside of the townwalls caused the heterogeneity of this group. The churches in Sagan, Freystadt (Kożuchów) and Militsch (Milicz) were timber-framed, the churches in Hirschberg and Landeshut by Martin Frantz modeled after Katarina Church in Stockholm, whereas the Protestant church in Teschen (Cieszyn, Český Těšín), modeled after Catholic Jesuit churches, was an exception.
The biggest metropolitan ensembles were carried out in Neisse, Breslau and Liegnitz. Important palaces, which combined residential and professional requirements, in Breslau were built by the family von Hatzfeld, von Spätgen, Hornes and von Schreyvogel, the latter being designed by Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt. The biggest secular urban developments of that time were the"Ritterakademie" (knights academy) in Liegnitz, built for aristocratic children of both religious conviction, and the destroyed episcopalian spital in Neisse. Almost no city hall was constructed during the baroque era, and few saved their baroque rebuildings.
The annexation by Prussia marked the beginning of the end of the Baroque era in Silesia. The orientation towards the new political and artistical center in Berlin brought changes in the organization of building activities along. New artists from Prussia took the place of dying Silesian artists (Tausch †1731, Peintner †1732, Hackner †1741, Frantz †1742, Frisch †1745), for instance G.L. Schirmeister in Oels (Oleśnica), J.M. Pohlmann in Oppeln (Opole) or Chr.Fr. Schultze in Breslau. The newly created building inspection department limited the importance of Silesian guilds and adjusted construction plans. 
Between the First and Second Silesian War almost only magazines, barracks, fortification and Protestant churches were built. Towns like Cose] (Koźle), Brieg, Breslau, Glogau, Neisse and Schweidnitz were converted to fortresses. Carlsruhe O.S. (Pokój) was the first of a number of frederician urban foundations, modeled after Karlsruhe. The liberated Protestant population built large quantities of modest churches in the first years of Prussian rule, which were portrayed by Friedrich Bernhard Werner. The most prestigious project of that time was the construction of the castle church in Breslau, which was remodeled by Carl Gotthard Langhans and became the prototype of all later classical Protestant churches. The final say of the Catholics in Silesia was the monastery complex of the Cistercians in Grüssau (1774–90).
The symbol of the changes and the first palace construction after the second half of the 18th century became the royal residence in Breslau (1750-53 by Joh. Boumann d.Ä.), which integrated the palace of the family von Spätgen and was a mix of Frederician rococo and classical components. Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz, commander of Frederick's army, erected a "Maison de plaisance" in Minkowsky (Minkowskie) which was akin to Sanssouci, and the palace of family von Maltzan in Militsch was modeled after the New Palace in Potsdam.
Neo-Classicism and Historicism.
After the Treaty of Hubertusburg, a long-lasting phase of political and economic stabilization led to building activities which lasted until the defeat of Prussia in 1806. The destroyed cities were rebuilt, Upper Silesia became industrialized and many defensive fortifications were put up. In 1775 Silesia was split into two separate construction departments, Breslau and Glogau, which were headed by fully independent construction managers ("Oberbaudirektoren"). The most important of these managers, Karl Gotthard Langhans, developed its own unique neo-classical style, which was of European importance.
The sacral architecture was now dominated by the Protestant church. After 1763 the small modest churches of the past were gradually abandoned and large monumental churches were built. Groundbreaking for the development of these churches were the churches in Cosel by Joh.M. Pohlmann and K.G. Langhans and in Groß Wartenberg (Syców) by K.G. Langhans in 1785. The new standards of these neo-classical churches were soon adopted by the churches in Waldenburg (Wałbrzych), Reichenbach (Dzierżoniów) and Münsterberg (Ziębice). The building activities of the Catholic Church stagnated until the mid 19th century.
The residential architecture between 1740 and 1806 was marked by dynamic changes regarding styles and types. New town palaces however were rarely built. The most important one was Palais Hatzfeldt in Breslau, one of the first neo-classical buildings in Europe, designed in 1764 by I. Ganevale and K.G. Langhans. Other palaces adopted the new style after 1770. The public initiatives affected mainly military buildings: monumental fortifications in Silberberg (Srebna Góra), Neisse and Glatz (Kłodzko) as well as new barracks in Breslau and Brieg. According to the welfare policy of Frederick II of Prussia new hospitals and workhouses were erected (Kreuzburg, Breslau), and with the beginning industrialization of Upper Silesia entire residential developments were planned.
New administration structures were adopted after the Prussian ministry for Silesia was closed in 1808 and the reforms by Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein and Karl August von Hardenberg were implemented. From now on every building project had to be accepted by the building inspection department, which itself was under the control of the royal police headquarters. Every town appointed its municipal architect and local building deputation controlled the technical aspects of every project. These principles were in effect until 1900.
After 1820 positive results of these reforms became visible as a new period of building activity began. Most of these activities were now carried out in the cities, which became dominant in the shaping of Silesia's architectural landscape. Dozens of theaters, houses for different associations, schools, hospitals or asylums were built. The most important artistical center was Breslau, and the most important Silesian architect until 1840 was Carl Ferdinand Langhans, son of Carl Gotthard and creator of the exchange, the theater, the loge "Friedrich zum goldenen Zepter" in Breslau and the theater in Liegnitz. A new type of apartment buildings began to evolve and the rich bourgeoisie began to live in large villas at the outskirts of the cities. 
The architecture of that time was marked by a broad mix of several neo-classical styles, from Palladianism, revolutionary Neo-Classizism (Hoym mausoleum by Friedrich Gilly) in Dyhernfurt (Brzeg Dolny) or Palais Hohenlohe with the construction of the palace in Kamenz by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. Summer residences for the king of Prussia and his court in Hirschberg valley were the most important phenomenon in the palace architecture, where more than 30 palaces, castles and manors formed a cultural landscape of outstanding importance. In the cities the town walls were razed (first 1807 in Breslau) and replaced by greens, among them the first public parks. 
The fourth decade of the 19th century was a turning point in the history of the Silesian architecture. Frederick William IV of Prussia ascended the throne in 1840, Karl Friedrich Schinkel died in 1841 and Karl Ferdinand Langhans finally moved to Berlin. Neo-Classizism was slowly replaced by Historism, the Silesian architecture linked more and more with Berlin and with the rise of the Wilhelmine empire the local architecture became fully dominated by German art movements. Neo-Renaissance was soon adopted in two varieties, Italian and Northern- German, the latter being promoted as the "national style". This German Renaissance was mainly used at state-run building projects, for instance post offices. Palaces and self-governments were often built in neo- Baroque forms, whereas neo- Romanic did not became popular in Silesia.
The departure of Karl Ferdinand Langhans left a gap which was soon filled by architects from Berlin. The time until 1914 was now marked by a peculiar rivalry between the architects from Silesia and Berlin. Communal and private building projects carried out by Silesian architects clearly cited local traditions, whereas governmental building projects dominated by architects from Berlin showed stylistic concepts without Silesian characteristics. The state (king, emperor) became the client with the most prestige, on his initiative many administrational buildings (regional councils, archives), prisons, courts of justice, police buildings and academies were constructed. As the leader of the Protestant church the king also founded many churches. The Catholic Church was still one of the biggest principals, especially in Upper Silesia. In 1883 a bishopric building officer was created, the first one being Josef Ebers. Not only churches were erected, but also hospitals, schools and many other buildings; approximately 2.000 Protestant and Catholic institutions in the entire 19th century. After 1850 the Jews became the third important ecclesiastic client and built large and representative synagogues which rivaled the churches of the other denominations. The most spectacular example was the synagogue "Am Anger" in Breslau, constructed by Edwin Oppler in 1872. They also built many hospitals and care homes. The religious equalization of Protestants, Catholics and Jews, which was typical für the second half of the 19th century in Prussia, was now mirrored by the architectural landscape of Silesia.
Thanks to the Prussian reforms in the beginning of the 19th century the bourgeoisie became the dominant group and replaced the patriciate, which partially left their town palaces and concentrated on big industrial investments in Upper Silesia. The bourgeoisie also became the foremost patrons and consumers of the arts and initiated the construction of many theaters, museums or galleries, in addition they also gave an impetus to the beautification of the cities with parks and promenades. Their biggest achievement however was the construction of countless apartment buildings, which led to a rapid growth of the cities and the transition of Breslau to a metropolis. At the same time the division of the suburbs into living spaces for workmen, craftsmen, industry and rich middle classes took place. This however occurred only in Lower Silesia. Most towns in Upper Silesia did not have an old town center but often only one street, and they also did not have suburbs but chaoticly scattered small apartment buildings for workers (so called "familoki"), which were closely connected to the local coal mines. An exception was the workers colony in Nickischschacht and especially Gieschewald, built by Berlin architects Georg and Emil Zillmann for Gesellschaft Georg v. Giesche's Erben.
The opposite to the Upper Silesian industrial small towns represented the Lower Silesian spas in the Sudetes mountain range. Silesia was without a doubt scenically the most beautiful part of Prussia, which was the reason for the speedy development of several railway lines to the spas at the foothill of the mountains in the second half of the 19th century. These villages and towns, with its exclusive sanatoriums and hotels, were a prestigious field of work for architects from Breslau, but some of them, like Görbersdorf (the Silesian Davos), were also carried out by non- Silesians like Edwin Oppler from Hanover (although he was born in Silesia). After the royal court left Hirschberg valley (which is also a part of the Sudetes) the region became attractive for a number of famous people from the German intelligentsia, among them Nobel Prize winner Gerhart Hauptmann, whose villa in Agnetendorf (Jagniątków ) was designed by one of the best architects from Berlin, Hans Grisebach, or political economist Werner Sombart, who resided in a villa in Schreiberhau by Fritz Schumacher from Hamburg.

Light (novel)

Light is a science fiction novel by M. John Harrison published in 2002. It received the James Tiptree, Jr. Award and a BSFA nomination in 2002, and was shortlisted for the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 2003.
Overview.
The book centres on the lives of three individuals — the physicist (and serial killer) Michael Kearney, on the verge of a breakthrough in theoretical physics sometime in 1999; Seria Mau Genlicher, the cybernetically-altered female pilot of a "K-ship", and the ex-space pilot and adventurer Ed Chianese. Seria Mau and Ed's stories take place in the year 2400 AD.
The lives of these three individuals are linked in many ways, though most tangibly by the presence of a mysterious creature called The Shrander, who appears in many guises to all three characters throughout the novel (with anagrammatic names of Sandra Shen and Dr. Haends). They are also linked by the Kefahuchi Tract, a space-time anomaly described as "a singularity without an event horizon", an object of awe and wonder that has been the ruin of many civilisations attempting to decode its mysteries.
The Shrander takes many forms, most often with the body of an old woman in a maroon wool coat, with a horse's skull for a head which may be similar to its original form. Harrison appears to have taken his inspiration for this strange entity from the legend of the Mari Lwyd, a creature with a horse's skull for a head, bedecked in ribbons, that features in the ancient folklore of Gwent and Glamorgan.
Elements of "Light" originally surfaced in Harrison's short fiction, particularly the stories "The Horse of Iron and How We Can Know It" and "The Incalling". The former contains prototypes of the Shrander and Kearney characters, whilst the latter deals with the Sprakes, a clan of dubious urban magicians. Both stories are available in the collected volume of Harrison's short fiction, "Things That Never Happen".
Characters.
Michael Kearney Strand (1999 AD).
Michael Kearney: 40-year old physicist and serial killer. Plagued by hallucinations of - or visitations from - a mysterious entity he calls "The Shrander".
Brian Tate: Kearney's research partner, whose dedication to his research into the physics of "decoherence free space" is eroding his marriage and, possibly, his sanity. Kearney and Tate's research ultimately paves the way for humanity to explore space.
Anna Kearney: Kearney's ex-wife, a psychologically brittle, (though eternally optimistic) woman of 40. When the novel begins, she is in a relationship, but the impromptu arrival of her ex-husband destroys this, and she and Michael begin their relationship again.
Valentine Sprake: A street drunk who first meets Kearney on an overground train, and guesses his terrible secret. The two become partners in magic and crime; it is hinted that Sprake has prophetic abilities, and his sister describes him as "one of the five most powerful magicians in London", a claim which Kearney mocks.
Seria Mau Strand (2400 AD).
Seria Mau Genlicher: Seria Mau signed up to Earth Military Contracts at the age of 13, whereupon she was cybernetically fused to her K-ship, the "White Cat". She subsequently went rogue and became a freelance assassin. Though she is in control of a ship of devastating capabilities, Seria Mau has not matured emotionally, and is prone to fits of murderous rage, lust and caprice.
Uncle Zip: A "tailor" (gene manipulator) based on the planet Motel Splendido, who deals in dubious merchandise. It is he who tells Seria Mau where she might find the space pilot Billy Anker.
Mona the Clone: A vain, empty-headed young woman who boards the White Cat with a team of salvagers. When they are killed, Seria Mau takes pity on her and allows her to live on board, though their relationship is fraught. It is heavily implied that "Mona" is one of the most common and fashionable "looks" for women in the galaxy, and the novel is filled with numerous versions of her.
Billy Anker: A decrepit "entradista" whom Seria Mau meets, rescues, and later murders. A daredevil pilot in his youth, he is a clone of Uncle Zip.
Ed Chianese Strand (2400 AD).
Ed Chianese: A thrill-seeker, adventurer and "twink" (Virtual Reality addict) who finds work as a futurist at a circus run by Sandra Shen.
Evie and Bella Cray: The Cray Sisters are notorious gangsters, to whom Ed owes money. Their hunt for him wrenches Ed from his various addictions and towards his true destiny.
Tig Vesicle: A "new man", one of a curious race of aliens who invaded Earth centuries ago. He and his wife Neena hide Ed when he is on the run.
Annie Glyph: a "rickshaw girl", genetically modified for the strength and speed required for long shifts pulling a rickshaw. Ed saves her life, and the two of them embark on an affair.
Reception.
Regina Schroeder in review for Booklist described the novel as "sometimes space opera, sometimes a kind of noir fiction, Harrison’s novel is a cleverly assembled contemplation of how choices make lives and of opening quantum mechanical doors on bizarre potential futures." Publishers Weekly said that "this is space opera for the intelligentsia, as Harrison...tweaks aspects of astrophysics, fantasy and humanism to hum right along with the blinking holograms in a welcome and long overdue return." Kirkus Reviews said this novel was a "profoundly thoughtful, complex, fascinating, and sometimes bewildering mosaic. Does it all add up? Well, objectively speaking, not altogether--and perhaps that's the point."
References and Allusions.
The novel is replete with references to Harrison's many interests - mountaineering, rock music, etc. In many ways, this is fitting for a novel that is, in part, about human beings and their endless capacity for re-use and re-invention. Song lyrics, references to old TV shows and numerous other allusions are dropped into the narrative at various points.
There are at least two allusions to the world of mountaineering in the book: the cruiser named "Touching the Void" and the remark by Chianese that "You don't get the tick unless you come back". There are also several references to The Stars My Destination by Alfred Bester, most notably the borrowed line about the vacuum of space "smelling of lemons". Seria Mau Genlicher's name is almost certainly a reference to Sarah Michelle Gellar, and at one point Kearney's partner Brian Tate reflects on watching reruns of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer".
Several of the chapters are also named after rock songs or albums. "Agents of Fortune" is an album by Blue Öyster Cult, and "Tumbling Dice" is named after the Rolling Stones song. In addition, the street gang who are assigned to find Ed Chianese in New Venusport are called The Skeleton Keys of the Rain, after a Bob Dylan lyric. The Shadow Operators, ghosts of old code who congregate in human ships, are apt to quote old song lyrics, including Joe Jackson's "Is She Really Going Out with Him?".
There are also references to old BBC TV shows, particularly in the trash-talk exchanged between Seria Mau and the other K-Captain, Krishna Moir. Seria Mau, upon firing a missile at Moir's pod of ships, declares "Here's one I made earlier", a catchphrase from Blue Peter, and Moir later responds with "It's goodnight from me. And a fucking goodnight to you", a profane parody of one of the catchphrases of The Two Ronnies.
London Locations.
London is arguably just as much of a character in the book as any of the protagonists, despite featuring mainly in the strand of narrative dealing with Michael Kearney. Many real London locations are utilised; Anna Kearney's flat is in Grove Park, near Chiswick; Kearney and Brian Tate's laboratory is in Bloomsbury; the offices of the venture capitalist that Tate sells his and Kearney's research to (and whom Kearney subsequently murders) is in Walthamstow, Kearney's private members club is in Greek Street, Soho; and Valentine Sprake and his family live in Kilburn. It is here where Kearney finds Sprake dead. Kearney first encounters The Shrander at Charing Cross, and meets a homeless woman who may or may not be her in Soho Square. Anna Kearney also follows Michael, at a distance, from Hammersmith, through Victoria to West Croydon, whereupon they discover the ultimate fate of Brian Tate.
The other strands often refer tangentially to Kearney's London; for instance, the backwater planet on which Seria Mau temporarily strands Mona the Clone is situated in a star system called Perkin's Rent, named after a street near Victoria.
Sequels.
Harrison wrote a sequel, "Nova Swing", which was published in 2006. Set a generation after the events of "Light", it deals with characters alluded to in the first novel, including Liv Hula, who "flew dipships" with Ed Chianese.
The third novel of what is now the Kefahuchi tract trilogy is "Empty Space" (2012).

Danny House

Danny is an impressive Grade I listed Elizabethan red brick Mansion near Hurstpierpoint in West Sussex, England. It lies at the northern foot of Wolstonbury Hill and may be regarded as one of the finest stately houses in Sussex, with 56 bedrooms and 28 apartments. The present house was built 1593-95 by George Goring, slightly to the east of an older house. It is set in eight acres (32,000 m²) of gardens at the foot of the South Downs.
Etymology.
The name Danny may be a corruption of the Saxon Dane(g)hithe, meaning 'valley and haven'.
History.
Pre-Roman.
The remains of a Bronze Age enclosure exists above Danny on the top of nearby Wolstonbury Hill ( now owned by The National Trust and within the South Downs National Park). On the west side of Wolstonbury there is a large artificial plateau thought to be the site of an Iron Age camp.
Roman times.
The Sussex Greensand Way Roman road passed through the site of Danny Park in an east-west direction, making an alignment change on the hill to the north of the house. The road survives as a terrace on the shoulder of the hill, a hollow way leading down the hill and a raised strip leading to the stream. A Roman pottery kiln has been found south of the road.
Domesday Book.
The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded that 'Robert holds Herst of William', i.e. that Robert de Pierpoint held the land from William de Warenne, who was a son-in-law of William the Conqueror.
13th century.
There has been a house of some sort on this site since the 13th century, originally little more than a hunting-lodge, when the medieval Park of Danny was enclosed by the last Sir Simon de Pierpoint in 1343
Late 16th century.
The house in its present form dates from the early sixteenth century but was reconstructed and enlarged by Charles Goring between 1593 - 1595.
It was designed in the shape of the letter E to represent the Queen (Elizabeth I of England) who had been on the throne for over 30 years at the commencement of the reconstruction work. The house represents a fine example of Elizabethan architecture.
The current house has two main fronts, the east 16th Century, the south early Georgian. The brick-built east frontage is monumental, the south front stately, the whole building a prominent element in views from the downs. It stands to three storeys. There is also a well preserved ice house in the grounds.
Mid 17th century.
After four generations of Gorings, Danny was sold to Peter Courthope in 1650. In 1652 Danny Great Park was 54 ha (135 acres) with arable land and meadow amounting to about 170 ha (420 acres). The parkland still contains large, noble oaks of varying ages and growth patterns and is used today for a variety of recreational activities.
In 1702, Barbara Courthope married Henry Campion, and in 1725 they made Danny their home, and soon undertook extensive alterations, including the re-fronting of the south side of the house as is confirmed by the date 1728 and their initials on the leaden water-pipes. Several generations of Campions followed.
War Cabinet.
During World War I, Danny was rented for six months to Prime Minister Lloyd George, where he lived here in a menage a trois with his wife Margaret and his secretary and mistress Frances Stevenson. Regular meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet were held in the Great Hall, where on 13 October 1918 terms of the armistice to be offered to Germany at the end of the Great War were decided, and authority was given to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson to negotiate the Armistice.
There were some letters, written from Danny, from Lloyd George to Frances Stevenson, one of which read:
"My darling Pussy. You might phone from the Treasury on Friday if you can come. Don't let Hankey see you. If Saturday impossible, what about Monday? Fondest love to my own."
D. (Hankey was then Cabinet Secretary).
Recent history.
Soon after the war Danny House became a school, Montpelier College, which had been transferred from Brighton, but this closed down in 1950. The house was then bought by Mutual Households Association (later the Country Houses Association). After the CHA went into liquidation in 2003, the house was bought by Richard Burrows in 2004, to maintain it as serviced apartments for retired people, bed & breakfast facilities and as a family business. In 2007, Danny House celebrated 50 years as a retirement home. Although the Campion family were no longer residing in the house, the estate continued in the ownership of the Campions until the 1970s when the estate was broken up and the various land holdings, houses and farms were sold to tenants or into private hands.

<doc id="9789058" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9789058" title="Sambalic languages">
Sambalic languages

The Sambalic languages are a part of the Central Luzon language family spoken by the Sambals, an ethnolinguistic group on the western coastal areas of Central Luzon and the Zambales mountain ranges. The largest Sambalic languages are Sambal, Bolinao, and Botolan with approximately 200,000, 105,000 and 72,000 speakers respectively based on the 2007 population statistics from the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB). These figures are the combined population of the municipalities where the language is spoken.
For the Sambali or Sambal ethnolinguistic subgrouping, the estimated number of speakers is based on the total population of Santa Cruz, Candelaria, Masinloc, Palauig, and Iba municipalities of Zambales. For the Sambal Bolinao subgrouping, a projected number of speakers is taken from the combined populations of Anda and Bolinao municipalities of Pangasinan. The Sambal Botolan subgroup, on the other hand, takes the aggregated population of Botolan and Cabangan municipalities. The rest are smaller languages spoken almost exclusively within various Aeta communities. In total, there are approximately 390,000 speakers of Sambalic languages. Speakers can also be found in other towns of Zambales not mentioned above: Olongapo City, Bataan, Tarlac, and Metro Manila.
An estimated 6000 speakers can also be found in Panitian, Quezon, Palawan and Puerto Princesa City. The language is also spoken by many Filipino immigrants in the U.S. and Canada. In Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada, for instance, the language is spoken by a clan of Zambals. In Casino Nova Scotia in the Maritimes city of Halifax, a group of Sambals can be found running the card games. Community organizations of Sambal-speaking Filipino-Americans are found in San Diego and San Francisco, California as well as in Hawaii.
The Sambalic languages are most closely related to Kapampangan and to an archaic form of Tagalog still spoken in Tanay in the province of Rizal. This has been interpreted to mean that Sambal-speakers had once inhabited that area, later being displaced by migrating Tagalog-speakers, pushing the original inhabitants northward to what is now the province of Zambales, in turn, displacing the Aetas. There is also a possible relationship between these Sambalic language speakers and the population of the island provinces of Marinduque and Romblon based on commonalities in some traditions and practices.
Table of speakers.
Sambal (Spanish: "Zambal") is the common collective name for all Sambalic languages speakers. It is also the term referring to the Sambalic language subgrouping in northern municipalities of Zambales, which comprises the majority of Sambals or more than 50 percent (200,000) of all Sambalic languages speakers (390,000). Sambal may also refer to the inhabitants of Zambales as a whole and the residents of Bolinao and Anda in Pangasinan.
Sample text: Philippine national proverb.
Below are translations in Sambal, Bolinao, and Botolan of the Philippine national proverb “He who does not acknowledge his beginnings will not reach his destination,” followed by the original in Tagalog.

Her most notable roles include those of "Amy Sumner" in "Straw Dogs" (1971) with Dustin Hoffman, and as "Mary Coombs" in "Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry" (1974), with Peter Fonda. When asked in a 2013 interview about working with Hoffman and director Sam Peckinpah in "Straw Dogs", George said:
I had a love-hate relationship with Sam, but he was a brilliant director and a genius of his time. Dustin was a generous actor to work with, who could be intense at times but had a great personality and an incredibly mischievous sense of humour. Making the film was a fantastic experience and one that I cherish to this day.
In the early 1970s George came to be associated with rather provocative, sometimes (as in "Straw Dogs") controversial, roles and became quite type-cast. Cinema writer Leslie Halliwell's rather terse summary of her career was: "British leading lady, former child actress; usually typed as sexpot"
Her lighter side was apparent in some of her TV appearances, such as in an episode (The Gold Napoleon) of "The Persuaders" (1971) with Roger Moore and Tony Curtis. In 1988, George marked her film producing debut with "Stealing Heaven".
Personal life.
Susan George was married to British actor Simon MacCorkindale from 5 October 1984 until his death from cancer on 14 October 2010. They had no children.
Equestrian interest.
George breeds Arabian horses and has a stud farm called Georgian Arabians. In 2007, she was featured in "Horse & Hound" magazine, in the "Talk Yourself Horse" page.

Teatro San Cassiano

The Teatro San Cassiano or Teatro di San Cassiano in Venice was the first public opera house when it opened in 1637. The theatre takes its name from the neighbourhood where it was located, the parish of San Cassiano near the Rialto. It was a stone building owned by the Venetian Tron family. It was considered 'public' as it was directed by an impresario, or general manager, for the paying public rather than for nobles exclusively.
The original theater, for spoken plays, was built by Andrea Palladio in 1565. His wooden structure succumbed to fire in 1629. This was soon after replaced by a stone building, which was acquired by the Tron family. At this point all the theatres of Venice, such as the Teatro San Salvatore of the Vendramin family, were aristocratic private theatres, not commercial.
The first operas of the commercially run venture were "L'Andromeda" and "La Maga Fulminata". These were produced in 1637 and 1638 respectively, by Romans Benedetto Ferrari and Francesco Manelli. Ferrari and company stayed until 1639 when the business was acquired by a new company managed by entrepreneur Francesco Caletti-Bruni, with financial backing from Venetian nobleman Cavalli. Caletti-Bruni composed most of the operas performed here in the six years from 1639 to 1645. After the 1650s the theater was surpassed by others, and its number of performances declined. Impresario Marco Faustini managed the Teatro San Cassiano from 1657 to 1660.
Towards the end of the 17th century, Venice became the opera capital of the world as another ten opera houses had opened. At this point the Teatro San Cassiano could count first performances of 37 operas. The last performances were held in 1807 and it was demolished in 1812, mainly due to recurring fires. The operatic period "dramma in musica" coincided with the early years of the commercial San Cassiano and was influenced by its composers.

Early Autumn

Early Autumn is a 1926 novel by Louis Bromfield. It won the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1927.
Plot synopsis.
The novel is set in the fictional Massachusetts town of Durham shortly after World War I. The Pentland family is rich and part of the upper class, but their world is rapidly changing. The old Congregational church the Pentlands long favored has disbanded as more and more WASPs have left Durham, replaced by immigrant Roman Catholics with new religious traditions. The Pentlands once ruled upper-class society in Durham, and still do. But even upper-class society is changing: Many of the "old line" families have either died off or moved away, while many "nouveau riche" have moved into the area who do not share the same old-fashioned values and observe the same old-fashioned norms of behavior that the Pentlands do.
The patriarch of the family is old John Pentland. He lives in Pentland Manor, a large and old-fashioned manor house, with his sister, Cassie. Cassie is a fussy, moralistic, snobbish old maid who sticks her nose into everybody's business and who is firmly determined to see that the Pentlands uphold the "old ways." Her companion is Miss Peavey, who lacks intelligence but in all other ways is as moralistic and disapproving as Aunt Cassie. John's son and heir, Anson, married the wealthy but low-status Scotch-Irish girl Olivia. The couple have a son, John (nicknamed "Jack") and a daughter, Sybil. The Pentlands say that they can trace their family heritage back to the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and Anson is writing a book about the family. John Pentland's niece, Sabine, is the black sheep of the family. Her parents died, and her home was lost to creditors. She became Aunt Cassie's ward. But twenty years ago, she married a poor, low-born man named Callender and fled with him to Europe. John Pentland acts as if he is widowed, but about a quarter of the way through the novel the reader realizes that his wife is not dead. For the past two or three decades, Pentland's wife (the reader never learns her name) has been insane, and now lives in an upstairs room in a far wing of the house. She is cared for by a nurse, Miss Egan. Every morning, John Pentland visits her and speaks with her despite her insanity. Afterward, he visits Mrs. Soames, a long-time friend of his wife's, and plays cards. His attention to the widowed Mrs. Soames is unseemly (so Aunt Cassie says), but no one can openly criticize him for it as John Pentland is the patriarch of the family.
The novel is set during the early autumn. Olivia is almost 40 years old, and she increasingly feels trapped and stifled by her life. She and her husband have a loveless marriage (they have not shared rooms for years), and their son Jack is constantly ill. The novel opens as Olivia's daughter, Sybil, returns home from a boarding school in Paris. Sabine Callender and her daughter, Therese, have also returned to Durham and are spending the summer at Pentland Manor. Therese is a débutante, and is being "introduced" to Durham upper-class society. Aunt Cassie and Miss Peavey repeatedly criticize Sabine for being a flapper and for the scandal she brought down on the family. Also visiting Durham that fall is Jean, the son of a Frenchman who married an American woman and who Sybil met in Paris. Sybil is in love with Jean, and creates scandal by pursuing him relentlessly.
Also newly arrived in Durham is Michael O'Hara, an Irish immigrant who has achieved wealth and political prominence in Boston. He bought Sabine's former home and is refurbishing it. Aunt Cassie and Miss Peavey are horrified by the "arriviste" and constantly snub him. Anson is upset by the attentions O'Hara lavishes on his wife and daughter. O'Hara soon tells Sabine that he has fallen in love with Olivia, and Olivia reciprocates. O'Hara says he is willing to sacrifice everything just to love her. Anson Pentland, meanwhile, refuses to give Olivia a divorce for fear it will ruin the his career and the family's good name.
Several events happen in quick succession: Jack dies, but only Olivia is there to comfort him at the end. Olivia discovers the Pentland groom is having a secret affair with someone in the house. (The reader realizes it is the nurse, Miss Egan.) The night Jack dies, Olivia runs into a momentarily-lucid Mrs. Pentland, who tells her that there is a secret in the attic which could not only destroy but also free the family. (She is quickly hushed by Miss Egan, and soon falls back into muddled incomprehensibility.) Sybil marries Jean, and Olivia is convinced her daughter will find the happiness that she has never had.
Several secrets are revealed by the end of the novel, which mark the Pentlands as hypocrites. Olivia learns that John Pentland loves Mrs. Soames (whether he has consummated his affair with her is unclear), and has not divorced his insane wife out of duty. His daily visits with his wife are not performed out of love (as everyone assumes) but out of a desire to divert attention from his affair with Mrs. Soames. Olivia comes to believe that Mrs. Pentland's ravings about a secret in the attic were not madness. She soon discovers a packet of letters that reveals that the Pentland family's ancestor was a bastard child who stole the name from an aristocratic family that had died shortly after arriving in the New World. She suspects Anson knows the truth, and is lying about the family in his book.
John Pentland, broken-hearted at the death of his grandson, changes his will and leaves all his money to Olivia. He commits suicide by riding his horse into a deep ravine and falling to his death. Olivia rejects Michael O'Hara's love, realizing that she is the only person strong enough to hold the Pentland family together through the coming years of immense change. John Pentland has given her the chance, through her control of the family fortune, to force the Pentlands to adapt rather than die off like so many other upper-class families have. By leaving with Michael, Olivia believes that she would be taking the easy way out and actually cheapening herself.

Thomas Forster

Thomas Forster (29 March 1683 – October 1738) was a Northumbrian politician and landowner, who served as general of the Jacobite army in the 1715 Uprising.
Life.
He was a member of the prominent Forster family of Bamburgh and Adderstone Hall, the son of Thomas Forster (1659-1725) of Adderstone, who was Member of Parliament for Northumberland 1705-1708 and High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1703. His mother was Frances Forster, daughter of Sir William Forster of Bamburgh Castle.
He was Tory Member of Parliament (MP) for Northumberland 1708-1716. He was, in 1700, co-heir, with his aunt Dorothy Crew (wife of Lord Crew, Bishop of Durham) of the estates of Bamburgh and Blanchland which had been bankrupted by financial extravagance. Although Lord Crew purchased the forfeited estates and settled the debts, the heirs were comparatively impoverished.
The Forsters were cousins to the Radcliffes. The head of the family Lord Derwentwater, himself a cousin of the Old Pretender, was a leader of the 1715 Jacobite Rebellion. Although a Protestant, with no military experience, Forster was elected to lead the Jacobite army. Under his direction Lancelot Errington captured the island of Lindisfarne. Forster was heavily defeated at the Battle of Preston and surrendered. Imprisoned in Newgate Prison, he later escaped to France where he served at the exiled Stuart court.
Forster was attainted and expelled from Parliament in 1716. He died in France. His body was returned to England and buried at Bamburgh.

Tsardom of Vidin

The Tsardom of Vidin (Bdin) (, "Vidinsko (Bdinsko) tsarstvo") was a medieval Bulgarian state centred in the town of Vidin. In 1257 the local lord Rostislav Mikhailovich was crowned as Tzar of Bulgaria in Tarnovo, but soon withdrew to Vidin. In 1356, Bulgarian tsar Ivan Alexander isolated Vidin from the Bulgarian monarchy and appointed his son Ivan Stratsimir (1356–1396) as absolute ruler of the domain of Vidin.
In 1365, the state was occupied by Hungarian crusaders, but the occupation was short-lived. In 1369, a Bulgarian and Wallachian campaign drove out the Hungarian military, then in 1393 the whole of Bulgaria, along with the rest of the surrounding region, fell to the Ottoman Empire. This brought an end to Bulgaria's medieval state empire. Vidin was now the only region controlled by the indigenous Bulgarian population and not the invading Ottoman Turks.
The Ottomans went on to conquer the despotates of Dobruja, Prilep and Velbazhd as well. Vidin's independence did not last long. In 1396, Stratsimir contributed soldiers to assist the Christian nations' bid to overturn the Ottoman Empire. Following defeat at the hands of the Ottomans outside the city of Nicopolis, Vidin finally fell under the sphere of the Ottomans led by Bayezid I.

Focal surface

For a surface in three dimension the focal surface, surface of centers or evolute is formed by taking the centers of the curvature spheres, which are the tangential spheres whose radii are the reciprocals of one of the principal curvatures at the point of tangency. Equivalently it is the surface formed by the centers of the circles which osculate the curvature lines. 
As the principal curvatures are the eigenvalues of the second fundamental form, there are two at each point, and these give rise to two points of the focal surface on each normal direction to the surface. Away from umbilical points, these two points of the focal surface are distinct; at umbilical points the two sheets come together. When the surface has a ridge the focal surface has a cuspidal edge, three such edges pass through an elliptical umbilic and only one through a hyperbolic umbilic. At points where the Gaussian curvature is zero, one sheet of the focal surface will have a point at infinity corresponding to the zero principal curvature.
Special cases.
The sphere is the only surface where both sheets of the focal surface degenerate to a single point.
Both sheets of the focal surface of a Dupin cyclide degenerate to curves. These curves form a pair of anticonics, i.e., an ellipse and a hyperbola in perpendicular planes, each passing through the respective foci of the other curve. For the torus, a special Dupin cyclide, the focal ellipse becomes a circle and the focal hyperbola degenerates to the axis of the circle.
One sheet of the focal surface of a channel surface will form a degenerate curve. Such surfaces includes all surfaces of revolution, where the degenerate curve is the axis of revolution.

Carlos Badion

Carlos Velasco Badion (born August 16, 1935 in Lubao, Pampanga, Philippines -June 20, 2002, 5th of 6 siblings of Clemencia Velasco and Pablo Badion) is a former Filipino basketball player. Although born in Pampanga, he grew up in Antonio Rivera Tondo, Manila where he started his checkered career playing in sandlot tournaments and for Abad Santos High. At 5'10½" tall, he was first spotted in an interscholastic tournament by Valerio Lopez of Mapua where he subsequently enrolled. He eventually shone in the NCAA and the MICAA, playing for such teams as the Jacinto Rubber Shoes, Crispa (where he became one of the pioneering members of that team) and YCO.
Known as the "Bad Boy" of Philippine basketball because of his unforgiving and physical defense, Badion popularized the moves that came to be known as the "bicycle drive" and the "jackknife layup," moves which young players tried to imitate during the 1950s. He starred for the Philippine national team in two Olympic tournaments and the 1958 Tokyo Asian Games where he and his teammates won the gold medal. He was also a vital cog of the national team that finished seventh in a 15-nation men's basketball tournament in the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, playing alongside the likes of Carlos Loyzaga, Antonio Genato, Ramon Campos Jr., Ramon Manulat, Martin Urra and Mariano Tolentino.
Voted Mr. Basketball by the Philippine Sportswriters Association eventually made a movie with the same title together with actor Bob Soler in 1957, Badion was also a mainstay of the team that won the inaugural staging of the Asian Basketball Confederation Championship held in Manila in 1960 together with Loyzaga, Kurt Bachmann, Loreto Carbonell, and Eduardo Lim. He was named to the All-Star team with Loyzaga and Most Valuable Player of the said tournament.
Unfortunately, Badion suffered a serious knee injury during the Philippines’ first round game against Uruguay in the 1960 Rome Olympics which ultimately forced him into early retirement. He then went into a number of business ventures after retiring and even once became the customs coordinator for Elizalde and Co. He started his coaching in 1975, leading the Mapua Cardinals to the NCAA title and the UST women’s basketball team to the UAAP title. He also handled the UST Glowing Goldies in the UAAP and the Army Jungle Fighters in the Philippine Basketball League.
Badion died of a heart attack.
