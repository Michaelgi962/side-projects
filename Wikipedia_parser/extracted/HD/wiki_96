Rani Maria Vattalil

Sister Rani Maria Vattalil (1954–95) was a Catholic religious and missionary social worker in the Franciscan Clarist Congregation (FCC), who worked among the poor within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Indore. She was born in what is now the Indian state of Kerala. She was declared to be a Servant of God in 2007, and her beatification is being considered.
Sister Rani Maria was murdered in a knife attack by a hitman named Samandar Singh at Nachanbore Hill in Indore, Madhya Pradesh on 25 February 1995. The murder was arranged because some landlords were offended by her work among the landless poor. Cardinal Gracias described her work as an "heroic example ... siding with the poor and disadvantaged." A museum in her honour exists at Pulluvazhy in Ernakulam.
The documentary depicting the murder and subsequent conversion of Samandar Singh to Christianity was the winner at the world interfaith harmony film festival 2013.

Kala Jahangir

Kala Jahangir (believed to have died December 15, 2003), was a notorious Bangladeshi crime boss. According to the police reports, he came from an educated family. Both his father and mother have been teachers at reputable schools in Bogra and Dhaka respectively. 
Early Life.
Jahangir was born and brought up in Bogra, but when his mother moved to Dhaka to take up a better job, he joined his mother and lived with her in Ibrahimpur. Many who knew Jahangir from his childhood blamed the social environment of Ibrahimpur for the person he later became. As an area inhabited by a socially heterogeneous group of people, ranging from middle class to those who were on the lowest rung of the society, Ibrahimpur was known for harbouring dubious people and criminal activities. But there is no record that Jahangir’s childhood was marred because of the place. Instead, he was quite well known as a meritorious student in the school, having passed the school secondary certificate examinations with star marks in 1992.
Politics and Crime.
Things however began to change when he went to college. Soon after his admission to Tejgaon College in 1993, Jahangir was arrested for stabbing two youths named Liton and Masum in the vicinity of the college. He was jailed for 21 days, and that changed everything. Jahangir was a thoroughly transformed person after his release from the prison. The gentle, mild spoken Jahangir became restless and dangerous, ready to attack anyone who opposed him. He quickly befriended the thugs and goons of his locality and gradually built his own "Bahini" (armed cadres), and became a top criminal of the city. Abandoned by his parents, Kala Jahangir, under the blessing of "political godfathers", entered the world of criminal activities. In 1994, Jahangir began participating in student politics at Dhaka University. He was recruited as a young cadre of the notorious Gopal Kaur gang and stayed with this gang until the end of the BNP's rule in 1996. The members of this gang used to reside in Jashimuddin Hall of Dhaka University, and it was here that another gang member, Kislu, was murdered under the leadership of Kala Jahangir. Possibly this was his first murder, but very soon he was implicated in the killing of many others, including Kiron, advocate Habib Mondol and "Murgi Milon". 
Elections.
When the BNP lost the national elections in 1996, Jahangir fled from the University area. He returned to fame only in 1999 with the ward commissioners’ election in the city. Enmity between the candidates came to a peak in the ward commissioners’ election, particularly in Ward No.16. A criminal who went ny the name of "Killer Abbas" (also a member of the student wing of the Awami League) became a candidate and his rival - Maqsud - was none other than the brother of another known criminal, nicknamed "Top Terror Bhuiyan Babu". Sensing his immediate defeat, Abbas sought help from Kala Jahangir in the election. Babu was killed, but Abbas and Jahangir had to flee the area to save their lives.
Gang activity.
Later on with the support of some other criminals Kala Jahangir created a powerful crime syndicate called the "Black Panther" and became its leader. According to some reports this group has the largest collection of illegal weapons in Bangladesh. Their main income is from contract killing and also from illegal toll collection (reportedly taking in 5 million Taka each month). Many believe that their toll collection is a well co-ordinated one and is backed by some members of the police force. It may be mentioned that in his 13 years of criminal activities he was arrested only once and that again in relation to the stabbing incident mentioned above. Although the government has announced an award of 100,000 Taka for his capture, but until now he has always succeeded in eluding the police. Nevertheless there is a rumour going on that Kala Jahangir had shot himself with his own revolver at Green Road in Dhaka city on December 15, 2003. The facts about whether he is dead or alive are still unclear. But his organisation remains intact, and fugitive gang members are believed to be operating from India.

Allen B. Reed

Captain Allen Bevins Reed (April 3, 1884 – February 28, 1965) was a U.S. Naval officer whose 30-year span of ship-commands began on a patrol gunboat fighting pirates and Moro rebels in the Philippines at the turn of the 20th century and ended as the plank owner commanding officer of the newly commissioned heavy cruiser in the 1930s. In the latter years of his naval career, Reed was attached to the office of the Chief of Naval Operations where his assignments included Director of Fleet Maintenance Division, Assistant to the Chairman of the U.S. Maritime Commission and navy liaison to the Office of Production Management before he went on retired inactive status in 1941, three months before the attack on Pearl Harbor.
Early life and education.
Allen Bevins Reed was born in Liberty, Missouri, on April 3, 1884, the oldest of four children of Sheriff James French Reed (1852-1909) and Fannie G. (Wymore) Reed (1857-1936), married on March 28, 1883. He was named for his grandfather, Captain Allen Grigsby Reed (1812-1899). Graduating from Liberty High School in 1900, Allen B. Reed received an appointment to enter the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland from Rep. John Dougherty (D-Missouri) of the 3rd congressional district.
Reed entered the Academy on September 22, 1900, as one of 93 fourth class naval cadets, as midshipmen were known until July 1, 1902 when the rank reverted to the traditional "midshipman". During the summers of 1901 and 1902 he made training cruises on the and USS "Chesapeake". There were 71 third class naval cadets in 1901-1902, 67 second class midshipmen in 1902-1903 and 62 first class midshipmen in 1903-1904. While at Annapolis, Reed was on the track, gymnastics and football teams. Reed's fellow graduates of the Naval Academy class of 1904 included future Admirals William S. "Bull" Halsey, Jr., commander of South Pacific Area and later United States Third Fleet during World War II and Husband E. Kimmel, commander of United States Pacific Fleet at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor.
Completing his academic studies at the Naval Academy, Reed received his warrant as a passed midshipman. On January 25, 1904 he was detached from Annapolis "to home and ready for sea". At that time, passed midshipmen were required to successfully complete two years sea duty before being commissioned as an ensign. On March 21, 1904, Reed reported for duty aboard the school ship USS "Mohican". On April 8, 1904, "Mohican" was assigned as station ship at the Naval Station, Olongapo, Subic Bay, Luzon, Philippines and one month later sailed from Mare Island Naval Shipyard via Honolulu, Guam, and Cavite for her new station, arriving February 4, 1905. Reed served on "Mohican" variously as W division and signal officer before he was detached on April 17, 1905 to be executive officer of .

"Paragua" was part of the Philippine Squadron of the Asiatic Fleet that along with other ships in the "mosquito fleet" of mostly seized ex-Spanish gunboats and steam yachts, patrolled the Philippine Islands primarily south of Mindanao in the Sulu Archipelago to intercept pirates, gunrunners, slave-traders and support U.S. Army and local Philippine Constabulary ground forces during the Moro Rebellion of 1899-1913.
On December 14, 1906, Reed detached from "Paragua" to the protected cruiser , cruising Asiatic, Philippine and Australian waters before returning to the New York Navy Yard on April 26, 1907.
Pacific fleet.
Reed was assigned to the protected cruiser of the Pacific Fleet Second Squadron Third Division, from June 10, 1907 to April 18, 1908 as W & D division officer and senior assistant engineering officer.

Pippin, his pay clerk and chief yeoman on the receiving ship , among other schemes, were suspected of withholding and embezzling uniforms bought by recruits and selling these and other supplies to civilian merchants. The board of inquiry found cause to court-martial Pippin and his two associates. They were ultimately convicted and Pippin and his pay clerk received sentences of seven and three years respectively, hard labor at San Quentin, "the severest punishment ordered by a naval court-martial in many years."

Elijah Sandham

Elijah Sandham (1875 – 7 May 1944)
was an English Independent Labour Party (ILP) politician from Lancashire. He sat in the House of Commons from 1929 to 1931 as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Kirkdale division of Liverpool, and in 1934 he led the breakaway Independent Socialist Party.
Career.
Sandham was elected in 1906 to Chorley Town Council, and remained active in the ILP, which at the time was affiliated to the Labour Party.
At the 1918 general election he unsuccessfully contested the Chorley division of Lancashire, and in 1924 he stood in Liverpool Kirkdale, where he lost by a wide margin to the sitting Conservative Party MP Sir John Pennefather, Bt. However, Pennefather retired from the Commons at the 1929 general election, when Sandham defeated the Conservative candidate Robert Rankin with a slim majority of 793 votes (2.6% of the total).
In Parliament.
In Parliament, he took a radical socialist viewpoint. In April 1930, the Commons debated on the Unemployment Insurance Bill, in which the Minister of Labour Margaret Bondfield proposed to raise the borrowing limit of the Insurance Fund to cope with high unemployment. The Liberal MP Milner Gray had suggested that a permanent solution to the funding problem lay in tackling the unequal share of wealth going to the rentier class. Sandham replied that his only interest in the rentier class was to abolish them.
However, it was a contribution outside Parliament which brought Sandham to wider attention. On 28 July 1930, the "Manchester Guardian" newspaper reported a speech by in Manchester by Sandham in which he denounced Labour MPs. The report was read to the Commons on 28 July 1930 by the Conservative MP Earl Winterton, who asserted that these assertions amounted to a "gross libel upon honourable Members of this Mouse and is a grave breach of its Privileges.
Sandham was not present, so debate was adjourned until the following day, when he explained that the speech had been made in response to the suspension of the Labour MP John Beckett. Sandham read to the House a longer extract from the speech, including the portion to which Winterton had objected:
When John Beckett touched the sacred symbol the other day, faces went white with horror. When J. H. Thomas took the initiative some time ago in handing over to the bankers the sacred reality of Parliamentary power, not a thrill of apprehension of regret stirred the conscience of these same custodians of democratic law and tradition. The sheer, stupid, tradition of this ghost-house has got most of the Members in its deadly grip. Labour Members can receive bribes to help pass doubtful Bills in the interests of private individuals. Labour Members can get stupidly drunk in this place. But none of these things are against the sacred traditions of the House. In fact, they are in keeping with them. It is known that Labour Members accepted money from moneylenders and other interests, and it is known that Labour Members of Parliament get drunk in the House. Our leaders see nothing wrong in that, or at any rate, such conduct is not bad enough to create a demand for their expulsion
The matter was referred to the Committee of Privileges,
whose report was issued on 30 July. The Committee found that "in making such allegations to a public meeting instead of from his place in the House of Commons the honourable member was guilty of a gross breach of privilege" and that "in stating that acceptance of bribes was in keeping with the traditions of this House he was guilty of a gross libel upon the House as a whole".
On 31 July the Commons debated the report, and voted by 304 to 13 that Sandham should be admonished by the Speaker.
After Parliament.
At the next general election, in 1931, he lost his seat to Rankin, and did not stand for Parliament again.
Sandham had been chairman of the Lancashire division of the ILP, but after the ILP disaffiliated from the Labour Party in 1932 he became critical of the power which the Revolutionary Policy Committee held within the ILP. In 1934 he led the breakaway Independent Socialist Party (ISP). The ISP's support was concentrated in North-West England, although it had a small pocket of support in East Anglia, but it never gained a significant following and was wound up in the 1950s.
He died aged 68 on 7 May 1944, at Horncliffe, Blackpool.

Formula E, officially the FIA Formula E Championship, is a class of auto racing, sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The "formula", designated in the name, refers to a set of rules with which all participants' cars must comply. Formula E is intended to be the highest class of competition for one-make, single-seater, electrically-powered racing cars. The series was conceived in 2012, with the inaugural championship to be held in 2014/2015.
Former Formula One driver Lucas di Grassi was announced as the series test driver in September 2012. He later stepped down from this role as he would have been unable to partake as a competitive driver in the first season if he were to remain as series test driver. Forty-two cars were ordered in November 2012, with Formula One team McLaren providing the motor, transmission and electronics that all cars will use.
Ten host cities are planning races for the 2014 season, and Formula E originally intended to run races exclusively on street circuits. However, not all races are now set for street circuits. On April 11, 2014, a calendar with 10 host cities for the 2014/2015 season has been confirmed, which consists of Beijing, Putrajaya, Punta del Este, Buenos Aires, Long Beach, Miami, Monte Carlo, Berlin and London, with one event yet to be announced.
Formula E will provide comprehensive live television coverage shown via major broadcasters around the globe. Production carried out by Aurora Media.
Four-time IndyCar champion and three-time Indianapolis 500 winner Dario Franchitti is to join the host television commentary team for the FIA Formula E Championship. Franchitti will act as co-commentator alongside lead commentator Jack Nicholls. Anchoring the coverage will be presenter and pitlane reporter Nicki Shields.
In order to manage the costs of operating a Formula E team each constructor will be mandated to make their car available to two other teams for a maximum capped price. This cap is currently set at 350 000€.
Specifications.
A few details about the specifications have been released by the FIA.
Event.
Races are planned to be 45 minutes in length.
Technical specifications.
Power.
Maximum power will be available during practice and qualifying sessions. During races, power-saving mode will apply with the 'Push-to-Pass' system temporarily allowing maximum power for a limited time.

Alcatraz water tower

Alcatraz water tower is on Alcatraz Island in the San Francisco Bay, off the coast of San Francisco, California. It is located on the northwestern side of the island, near Tower No. 3, beyond the Morgue and Recreation Yard. The water tank is situated on six cross-braced steel legs submerged in concrete foundations. 
History.
As Alcatraz had no water supply of its own, it had to import it from the mainland, brought by tug and barge. During the island's military years, it was stored in ground tanks and cisterns situated on the roof of the citadel. The water tower was built in 1940–41 by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, after the island received a government renovations grant to supply the majority of the island's fresh water.
It is the tallest building on the island, at a height of with a volume of of fresh water. It was used to store potable water for drinking, water for firefighting, and water for the island's service laundry facility. During the Occupation of Alcatraz, the water tower was subject to heavy graffiti by the Native Americans and has since become a cultural landmark. Graffiti included "free Indian land -- Indians welcome."
The tower has been empty since 1963 and has deteriorated, eroded by the salt air and wind. From November 2011 through April 2012, the tower was given a US$1.1 million restoration to prevent "irreparable damage and loss of important historic resources". Steel components were replaced and the tower was seismically upgraded. The lead paint was sanded and the tower repainted with marine paint.

K. R. Naik

Kamlaksha Rama Naik, better known as K R Naik (Hindi: क़ रा नायक़) is an Indian industrial engineer. He founded D-Link Ltd. (India) in 1993. He has been in the IT Industry for 42 years and has played a key role in creating the IT networking market and the surrounding channel ecosystem in India. He pioneered several new businesses and distribution models as early as 1990, when IT was a nascent industry and the concept of an IT distribution channel was just conceived.
Early life.
Naik was born in Karwar, Karnataka on 19 November 1947. He completed his schooling in Karwar and later shifted to Mumbai. Naik is a mechanical engineer with a P.G. Diploma in Industrial Engineering and Licenciate in Plastic Engineering. He earned a Business Management degree from the Jamnalal Bajaj Institute in Mumbai.
Career.
His first job at Mumbai was with Bradma, but soon after that he joined IBM India in 1970 starting as a Mainframe Peripheral Assembly Engineer. In 1977 he contributed significantly to the development of an indigenous line printer at the 'Big Blue' center. He worked to develop indigenous computer peripheral parts of plastic and metal until IBM closed its Indian operation in 1978. After IBM closed down, he joined ORG System Ltd. wherein he was one of the 6 team members who developed the first indigenous line printers with a speed of 1000+ line per minute.
In 1984, Naik founded Virtual Computer Pvt. Ltd., and was among the first to import a wave-soldering machine to manufacture printed circuit boards of PCs.
From 1990–91, Naik entered into networking products as a distributor of D-Link brand products. Within 3 years, he decided to start manufacturing of networking products in India as a joint venture with D-Link. Taking financial and tax advantages offered by the government of Goa, he shifted manufacturing operations from the Ansa Industrial Estate in Mumbai to Verna Electronic City, Goa. In 1994–95 he also started a passive networking-products company together with UK-based passive components company Sapphire UK Ltd. In 1994, he entered into a joint venture with D-Link Corporation Taiwan and helped constructing new buildings and importing SMT lines from Japan.
In 1995, Naik set out to create a completely new channel for D-Link products. Rather than going after large distributors he decided to put a regional distribution model in place—arguably the first in India among the IT channel.
Personal life.
Naik's wife Sudha Naik is a homemaker; they have 2 daughters: Arati Naik and Dr. Lakshana Sharma (who is married to Dr. Amit Sharma).

Astra 2F

Astra 2F is one of the Astra communications satellites owned and operated by SES, launched in September 2012 to the Astra 28.2°E orbital slot. The satellite provides free-to-air and encrypted direct-to-home (DTH) digital TV and satellite broadband services for Europe and Africa.
Astra 2F is the first of three ‘second generation’ satellites for the 28.2°E position which replace the first generation Astra 2A, Astra 2B and Astra 2D craft previously there. The second, Astra 2E, was launched in 2013 and they will be joined in orbit by Astra 2G in 2014 Some parts of the construction of Astra 2F by Astrium in Stevenage, UK could be seen in the BBC2 documentary programme, "How To Build… A Satellite" broadcast on November 27, 2011.
Astra 2F was successfully launched from Kourou in French Guiana on September 28, 2012. and underwent in-orbit testing at 43.5°E. Commercial operations at 28.2°E began on November 21, 2012.
Market.
The Astra 28.2°E position was established in 1998 to provide digital TV, digital radio and multimedia services to the UK and Republic of Ireland, and Astra 2F’s primary mission is to continue this provision as replacement and follow-on capacity to the Astra 2A, Astra 2B, Astra 2D and Astra 1N satellites, delivering programming to almost 13 million satellite homes, over 3 million cable homes, and 700,000 IPTV homes in the UK and Ireland, in particular for channels from the major UK digital satellite TV platforms, BSkyB and Freesat.
In addition, Astra 2F serves the growing DTH platforms in West Africa such as Ghana’s MultiTV.
Astra 2F is also designed to provide SES Broadband’s first commercial Ka-band satellite broadband service in Europe, with a Ka-band payload delivering high-speed Internet access (at download speeds up to 20Mbit/s) along with VoIP, and IPTV from November 2012.
Broadcasting footprint.
Astra 2F has three Ku-band downlink beams covering Europe and Africa. The Europe beam is centred on the English Channel with maximum signal (for reception on a 40 cm dish) over the UK, Ireland, France, Benelux, and parts of Germany, Austria, and Spain (including a "lobe" specifically designed to serve the Canary Islands which officially requires a 120 cm dish but in practise is easily receivable using a 90 cm dish as with Astra 2E), and reception on a 1m dish extending to North Africa, Poland and the Balkans.
The UK Spot beam provides maximum signal (40 cm dishes) over the UK and Ireland in close approximation of the UK Beam of Astra 2D, which it replaces. Due to the tight footprint, some reception issues for UK channels are being reported in Spain as of December 2012. Early reports of test transmissions on 11.023 GHz H 23000 DVB-S2 suggest the beam is very tight with a very sharp fall off to the west and east of the footprint, but eastern Spain seems to be getting a higher signal strength possibly due to the off-axis beam as 28.2°E on the geostationary arc is not directly in line with the UK but offset to the east.
The West Africa beam provides for reception with 60 cm dishes across southern West Africa from Senegal to Nigeria, with a lower signal level (80 cm dishes) extending across the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The Ka-band footprint for satellite broadband provides full service coverage across western Europe from the UK and France in the west to Czech Republic, Austria, Croatia and Boznia Herzegovina in the east.
Active Transponders.
Below is a list of the TV channels broadcast from active transponders on Astra 2F :
In the list, channels broadcast with a one-hour delay are shown "Channel +1hr". Where both the original and the delayed channel are broadcast from the same transponder, this is shown in one entry as "Channel +1hr".

Australia–Hong Kong relations

Australia–Hong Kong relations refers to international relations between Australia and Hong Kong. Australia has extensive and enduring interests in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The Commonwealth of Australia supports Hong Kong's "high degree of autonomy" under Chinese sovereignty as provided for by the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, and in accordance with China's policy of observing "one country, two systems".
History.
Australian gold rushes in the 1850's was the first interaction between Australians and southern Chinese, as the colonial Hong Kong became the point of departure for immigrants from southern China. White migration within the British empire continued along the sea lines of communication between Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia/New Zealand. After Australia's Federation in 1901, the "Immigration Restriction Act 1901" was implemented to limit non-white immigration (including Eurasians) to Australia. Ethnic Chinese immigration resumed slowly as the White Australia policy was wound back during the 1950s and 1960s.
Australians have filled senior and mid-level posts in tertiary institutions and the Hong Kong government. HKU physiologist Lindsay Ride of Newstead, Victoria, established and commanded the British Army Aid Group during the Second World War. Philip Haddon-Cave of Hobart, Tasmania continued the Hong Kong government policy of positive non-intervention during his tenure as Hong Kong Financial Secretary.
Bilateral agreements.
Articles 151, 153 and 155 of Hong Kong Basic Law permits Hong Kong to conclude non-military bilateral agreements with foreign countries, while article 152 permits Hong Kong to join international organisations.
Both Hong Kong and Australia are full members of APEC and FATF, and are bilateral participants on air services agreement (since 1993), Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (since October 1993), Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement (since 1999), Surrender of Fugitive Offenders Agreement (since June 1997), Transfer of Sentenced Persons Agreement (since 2006). 
Political relationships.
Australia's policy toward Hong Kong is underpinned by its substantial commercial interests, and by the presence of a large Australian community living in Hong Kong.
Article 82 of Hong Kong Basic Law permits Hong Kong to invite judges from other common law jurisdictions to sit on the Court of Final Appeal. The Hong Kong Government continues to hire and appoint Australians, with or without Right of Abode in Hong Kong, to senior post in the Hong Kong Judiciary. Former Hong Kong Director of Public Prosecutions, Kevin Zervos, was made a High Court judge in 2013. Sir Anthony Mason, Murray Gleeson, James Spigelman, William Gummow are appointed to the Court of Final Appeal as non-permanent justices from other common law jurisdictions.
The Australian Consulate-General represents the Australian Government in Hong Kong. Some Australian states havetrade or business offices in Hong Kong, including Queensland and Victoria. In Australia, the Hong Kong SAR is represented through the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office based in Sydney.
Trade and investment.
Australia's commercial interests in Hong Kong are extensive and range from banking, accounting, legal, engineering, information technology services and retail and general trading. Around 550 Australian companies are based in Hong Kong, and a further 1,000 Australian companies have representative offices.
Cultural.
Some 80,000 Australians are resident in Hong Kong. According to the 2010 Census in Australia, around 90,000 people of Hong Kong origin now live in Australia, with more than 244,000 Cantonese speakers in Australia, after Greek. The majority Hong Kong immigrants live in Sydney and Melbourne.
Australia is one of the major English-speaking study destinations for students from Hong Kong due to monetary factors; while the Australian government is encouraging an enhanced two-way student mobility through the New Colombo Plan educational exchange.
Tourism.
Both Australia and Hong Kong have offered "Working Holiday Programs" without quota restriction for maximum of 12-months since September 2001. The programme allows students to holiday in Hong Kong or Australia and to take temporary employment as needed to cover the expenses of their visit. The programme aims to increase travel by young people between Australia and Hong Kong and to strengthen the links between the two regions.

Throughout his career Wade has worked within the Lloyd’s insurance market where he has been Chairman or CEO of many firms as well as creating a number of programmes through various types of pro bono work. Wade has been Chairman of Besso Insurance Group Ltd since 2011.
Before his position with Besso, Wade was the Chairman of Optex Group Ltd from 2006 before it was acquired by Besso Limited in 2011. Wade also spent several years at the non-executive Chairman Lloyd’s broker Bowood Holdings before an September 2008 trade sale. 
Wade partnered with John Holman & Sons in 1980 to form Holman Wade Ltd specialising in reinsurance. This firm was merged into Horace Clarkson in 1984 and then floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1986 as Horace Clarkson plc. 
He resigned from Clarksons with Sir Peter Parker in 1993 to work on forming the CLM Insurance Fund plc which was one of the first ‘corporate capital’ vehicles at Lloyd’s which Wade had pioneered during the Lloyd’s crisis leading up to 1992. 
During his time with CLM, Wade was Chief Executive Officer before merging the group with a rival firm in 1999. In 2000 he stepped down and focused on the Rostrum Group Ltd. Wade worked with Lord Hodgson in creating the investment management firm Rostrum Partnerships which invested in specialist Lloyd’s underwriting companies on behalf of major UK pension funds on a five-year contract to 2005.

The Temple of Gold

The Temple of Gold is a 1957 novel by William Goldman. It was Goldman's first novel, written in three weeks over the summer he graduated from college, in June-July 1956. Goldman had never written a novel before, but had several years experience of writing short stories. The title "Temple of Gold" was taken from the film "Gunga Din".
The novel was accepted by the first publisher he sent it to. Goldman later said:
I never would have continued as a writer if "The Temple of Gold" had not been taken by the first publisher I sent it to. I'm not that masochistic. There was no way I was going to write anymore. I didn't know that then, but I know it now. There was no encouragement; no one ever said I had any talent. I had never written anything much over two pages long. I had done badly in school in terms of writing. I did not want to be a failure, but I did not have the courage to write a second book if the first had not been accepted.

Your Turn to Curtsy, My Turn to Bow

Your Turn to Curtsy, Mr Turn to Bow is a 1958 novel from William Goldman. He wrote it after a 50 week break following his first novel and finished it in seven days.
Goldman says he was inspired by reading a story by Harold Brodkey in the "New Yorker" called "First Love" and feeling he could write a better love story.
The book was not widely reviewed when it came out but enjoyed more than fourteen publications in paperback since it came out. Goldman:
Doubleday published it because they thought I might make some money for them someday, but the book found a certain cult. It's sold a lot of copies and it's very popular with the kids in the high schools and colleges. It's a very strange thing.
Adaptation.
A film version was announced in 1964 but was never made.

Hunkerin'

Hunkerin' (hunkering) is where a person sits in a squatting position. It is common worldwide, but briefly became an American fad in the late 1950s.
Hunkerin' had been in use in many cultures, particularly in Asia, for centuries when it suddenly became a fad in the United States in 1959. "Time" reported that the craze started at the University of Arkansas when a shortage of chairs at a fraternity house led students to imitate their Ozark forefathers, who hunkered regularly. 
While the word "hunkerin'" is believed to originate from the Scots word for "haunches", claims were made for Yorkshire, Korea and Japan. 
The fad spread first to Missouri, Mississippi and Oklahoma, then across the U.S. While males were the predominant hunkerers, it was reported that female hunkerers were welcomed. Within months, regional hunkerin' competitions were being held to discover champion hunkerers.
Considered by authorities as preferable to the craze of the previous year, phonebooth stuffing, people hunkered for hours on car roofs, in phone booths and wherever people gathered. "Life" referred to it as "sociable squatting". Different styles of hunkerin' were reported as "sophisticates" tended to hunker flatfooted while others hunkered with their elbows inside the knees.
Reasons for the popularity of hunkerin' included the ability for large groups of people to participate together peacefully to discuss issues such as politics or sport. When asked about the popularity of hunkerin', one hunkerer said hunkerin' was 
"A respite from a world of turmoil. The main purpose of hunkerin' is to get down and hunker together. It's a friendship thing: get your friends to hunker with you. The man you don't know is the man you haven't hunkered with." By 1960 hunkerin' was less common.
Hunkerers urged United States President Dwight Eisenhower and General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Nikita Khrushchev to hunker together to end their differences.

No Country

No Country (named Test Your Reflex from 2004–2009) is an indie rock/pop band from Los Angeles, California. The name change coincided with the end of their contract with RCA Records. As "No Country" the band remain unsigned. Their only release since leaving RCA was a single as the fictional band Low Shoulder for the soundtrack to the 2009 film Jennifer's Body. On July 14, 2010 the band put out two singles on their MySpace page.
The band's debut release was "The Burning Hour" (released April 24, 2007) on RCA Records. The album has been described as having an 80s sound with hints of U2, The Cars, and Simple Minds as well as The Cure and The Killers.
The band featured on the MySpace Tribute to the Smashing Pumpkins album released on MySpace Records and distributed in the July 2007 issue of SPIN Magazine. They liken themselves to other bands on the Pumpkins tribute, such as The Bravery.
All tracks appeared on each band's MySpace page from May 14, 2007. "Test Your Reflex" opened for The Smashing Pumpkins on July 22, 2007 at The Fillmore in San Francisco. 
Before that, from March 22, 2007 to May 12, 2007, "Test Your Reflex" toured the US with the Detroit-based band Electric Six.
Television performances include two appearances with Carson Daly. On June 22, 2007 the band appeared on Last Call with Carson Daly and the following month performed on the Carson Daly show (aired July 12, 2007).
Their song "Thinking of You" is featured as the background music of a radio commercial for Michelob Golden Light beer, heard in the Twin Cities and other markets in the midwest where the beer is sold.
History and Influences.
The group is composed of five musicians of various backgrounds currently all between the ages of 19-21. As "Test Your Reflex", they started out in the rehearsal rooms of a teen center in Thousand Oaks, California. They came together in early 2004. 
Having played in various electronic and rock bands since grammar school, lead singer Levine decided he wanted to try something new. Inspired by classic albums like U2’s "The Joshua Tree", Peter Gabriel’s "So" and Joni Mitchell’s "Blue", after experimenting in his garage, Levine gradually developed the sound that would become "Test Your Reflex".
It started when Levine met drummer Sal Cortez through an ex-girlfriend. The two then began searching for others to join them. After many months they finally found guitarist RC (a.k.a. Ryan Clark), a former guitarist of Los Angeles punk band R.O.H. Then came keyboardist Andrew Ampaya, a classically trained pianist with similar musical influences. With innovative and like-minded bassist Agustin Sanchez joining shortly thereafter, the first and final line up of "Test Your Reflex" was created.
In 2009, the group changed its name to No Country. Also in 2009, two members of the band (Ryan Levine and Sal Cortez) appeared as members of the fictional band "Low Shoulder" in the 2009 film "Jennifer's Body". The band performed the songs "Through the Trees" (written by Ryan Levine and Andrew Ampaya) and "One More Night" (written by Ryan Levine) as well as Blondie's "In the Flesh" in the film. The film's soundtrack includes the song "Through the Trees" by "Low Shoulder".

Boys and Girls Together

Boys and Girls Together is a 1964 novel by William Goldman.
Background.
Goldman says his creative impulse behind the book was his desire to write a long novel:
At the time, all of my friends were screwing up in New York, it seemed. It was going badly for everybody. The city was... affecting all of us, and I wanted to get that down. But writing that novel was a tremendous experience. It was three years of my life on and off. After writing three hundred pages, Goldman took some time off to work on Broadway, and when he returned to the book he found himself blocked, so he wrote another novel instead, "No Way to Treat a Lady". Goldman then returned to the novel and eventually finished it despite being in great physical pain a lot of the time. The novel was a best seller.
However it received an extremely hostile review from Conrad Knickerbocker in the "New York Times Book Review". Goldman later recalled:
"Boys and Girls Together" was three years of my life and I thought it was not what I meant. It was depressing, and not at all what I had meant when I started. It's so hard to fill that many pages, and I thought, "Well, it's not what I meant, but at least they'll have to think I'm serious. Nobody would write this depressing a book, in which nobody gets what they want and everybody fails, if you're trying to be Harold Robbins." There was a review of "Boys and Girls Together" that I remember very clearly. It was one of the most painful reviews of my life by a critic from the "New York Times" called Conrad Knickerbocker... compared me with Harold Robbins, and I thought, "You never read Harold Robbins. They get what they want in that world, and this is basically a cold, unpleasant book." I remember for a month I was on the verge of tears.
Richard Andersen wrote of the novel that:
Seeing all their energies leading to death and betrayal, the characters of "Boys and Girls Together" conclude that there are no satisfactory alternatives. Life is hopeless. Nevertheless, suicide is not the answer; man must find a way to affirm life over death whenever his identities fail him. One way of achieving affirmation in the wasteland, Goldman seems to be saying, is through endurance.
Adaptations.
In 1976 it was announced the novel would be turned into a mini series but this did not happen.

Liverpool Kirkdale by-election, 1910

The Liverpool Kirkdale by-election, 1910 was a parliamentary by-election held in England on 20 July 1910 for the House of Commons constituency of Liverpool Kirkdale.
Vacancy.
The by-election was caused by the death on 3 July 1910 of Charles McArthur, Kirkdale's Conservative Member of Parliament (MP).
He had held the seat since a by-election in 1907, having previously been MP for Liverpool Exchange from 1897 to 1906.
The writ for the by-election was moved in the Commons on 12 July by Sir Alexander Acland-Hood, the MP for Wellington.
Candidates.
By 5 July, rumours were circulating in Liverpool that the Conservative candidate would be Alderman Barran, but "The Times" newspaper reported that these were unfounded. The paper also reported that it was unlikely that a Liberal candidate would be nominated, making the election a two-contest between Labour and the Conservatives, as had been the case in the general elections of 1906 and January 1910.
However, the paper noted that Liberal votes would likely be cast almost entirely for the Labour candidate, while Labour were confident that their likely candidate Alexander Gordon Cameron would attract the Protestant votes which were so significant in that area.
On 9 July the Conservatives adopted Colonel Gerald Kyffin-Taylor as their candidate. He announced that his priority at the election would be defence of the British Empire, and he also committed himself to tariff reform, while opposing to Irish Home Rule and reform of the House of Lords.
Campaign.
Kikdale was known in Liverpool as the "bedroom of the docks"; an area housing dock labourers and the poorest of the poor, as well as the skilled tradesmen who worked in the constituency's docks and shipyards.
There was nothing resembling an upper class in Kirkdale, where skilled artisans and shopkeepers sat at the top of the social scale. "The Times" reported that while both groups deplored the passionate religious sectarianism which was rife in the poorer areas of the constituency, Kyffin-Taylor had made a strident protestanism a main plank of his campaign.
Cameron denounced the sectarianism, and "The Times" reported that despite the furious speeches on religious matters, the election was likely to be decided by whether voters preferred Kyffin-Taylor's tariff reform to Cameron's socialism,
although Cameron made little use of the term.
The Liberals' role in the campaign was subdued, with support for the Labour candidate expressed in terms of patronage and apology. Despite Cameron's support for Home Rule, and the large number of Irish people in the constituency, there was no Irish nationalist campaign in his support, whereas many Irish Unionists addressed public meetings. The Labour campaign also lacked high-profile speakers. Ramsay MacDonald made one speech before leaving again, whereas the Conservatives had a succession of good local speakers, including all their local MPs.
Result.
Polling took place on 20 July, and the count took place that evening. The result was a victory for Kyffin-Taylor, who held the seat for the Conservatives with a majority of 841 votes, or 11% of the total. This was a slight increase on McArthur's 2.8% majority in January.
After the declaration, Kyffin-Taylor went to the Liverpool Conservative Club, where he described his win as a victory for Constitutionalism against Socialism, as a declaration that a Protestant country should have a Protestant king. He said that voters were tired of a government which would not look after the defences of the Empire and tired of seeing men unemployed when tariff reform could restore jobs.
His speech was followed by an address from Alderman Salvidge, who denounced "The Times" special correspondent for preferring to have a socialist sitting in the Commons, and complained that other leading Conservative journalists had also tried to discredit Kyffin-Taylor's campaign.
Aftermath.
Kyffin-Taylor was re-elected at the general election in December 1910, with an increased majority. During World War I he was appointed to command the Artillery of the West Lancashire Division in January 1915 as a temporary colonel,
and he resigned from the Commons in February 1915 due to his military commitments. In 1917 he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General.

Huntsman's Quarry

Huntsman's Quarry () is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest in Gloucestershire, notified in 1974. The site is listed in the 'Cotswold District' Local Plan 2001-2011 (on line) as a Key Wildlife Site (KWS) and a Regionally Important Geological Site (RIGS).
Location and geology.
The site lies in the Cotswold Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and provides significant exposures of the "Cotswold Slate" facies of the Middle Jurassic period in the county. These slates have yielded a rich and diverse fauna and flora for research over a long period of time. These include the remains of reptiles such as turtles, crocodiles, dinosaurs and pterosaurs. Also found have been fish, starfish, barnacles, insects and biovalves. The site has also provided ammonites of significant biostratigraphical importance. The site has on-going potential for research into sediments and the environment of the area during the Middle Jurassic.

The Thing of It Is...

The Thing of It Is...' is a 1967 novel written by William Goldman about Amos McCracken, a 31 year old man who has written a popular show tune and who is having marriage troubles.
It was followed by a sequel, "Father's Day".
Background.
Goldman was inspired to write the novel by a trip he and his family took to Europe following some script doctoring work he did on the film "Masquerade" (1965). He was particularly influenced by visiting St Pauls Cathedral, which he thought would be a good location for a fight because it echoed, and seeing the original Jewish ghetto in Venice, which made him examine his Jewishness.
"Within three weeks of me seeing the ghetto, the book was completed," said Goldman. "That's the only time I've ever written close behind a situation. Every other time it took years and years."
Film Adaptation.
Goldman later described an unsuccessful attempt to turn the novel into a film in "Adventures in the Screen Trade". Robert Redford expressed interest in playing Amos, so Goldman wrote a screenplay on spec. Redford said he liked it and Ulu Gosbard agreed to direct. However "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" then came out and Redford turned into a major star, and pulled out of the project. Elliott Gould agreed to play the lead instead, but then Gosbard dropped out to make a film. Faye Dunaway agreed to co-star, and Mark Rydell expressed interest in directing. However Rydell wanted another writer to work on the project, which Goldman objected to and the film did not proceed. A year later Stanley Donen expressed enthusiasm for the script and succeeded in getting interest from Robert Evans at Paramount. Mia Farrow was signed to play the female lead, but Evans was not happy with the male lead, despite James Caan and Alan Alda both wanting to do it. Eventually Farrow had to drop out but Evans agreed to make the movie if it could be turned into a vehicle for Ali MacGraw. Goldman and Donen tried but MacGraw was not happy with the script and the movie was never made.

Heat is a 1985 novel by William Goldman about a soldier of fortune in Las Vegas. 
It was adapted into a 1986 film that starred Burt Reynolds and is being remade for a 2014 version with Jason Statham.
The novel is about a man named Nick Escalante, nicknamed "the Mex" by his friends, who hires himself out in Las Vegas not as a mercenary or bodyguard but as a service listed in the Yellow Pages directory under "Chaperone." He eschews firearms but is particularly lethal with sharp objects.
Escalante has one ambition, which is to save up enough money so that he can move to Venice, Italy for the rest of his life. The trouble is, Nick is a compulsive gambler.
When he comes into a large sum of money after coming to the aid of a woman friend who has been physically abused in a Vegas hotel suite by DeMarco, an arrogant mobster, Nick ends up losing it at the blackjack tables. He is hired by a meek millionaire named Cyrus Kinnick on the pretense of needing a bodyguard, but in actuality the small, modest man seeks lessons in how to be a tougher individual who can properly defend himself.

"Father's Day" is a 1971 novel by William Goldman. It is a sequel to "The Thing of It Is..." and revolves around a day in the life of now-divorced Amos McCracken as he looks after his daughter for a day.
Background.
Goldman says he was inspired to write the book by a situation which had occurred a number of years previously. Producers of a play had fired the original writer and hired Goldman and his brother James to rewrite it. Goldman:
Now, when you're replaced, it's very wounding, but it happens to everybody and you leave, but the writer we replaced wouldn't. So that, basically, was where being fired out of town in the novel came from, but in this case, it was terrifying because the original writer just wouldn't leave. And I understand how terrible it must be. The McCracken situation came from that one. The characters in the book are repeating the same group that's had an earlier hit in the novel. The impossible way that writer acted out of a sense of distraughtness is Amos.
"The Settle for Less Club".
Goldman later said he intended "Father's Day" to be book two of a trilogy with the third book called "The Settle for Less Club". It was going to be about Amos in Hollywood when the movie of his musical is being made. Goldman:
What happens is, Amos decides to marry the girl, who was his mistress, and wants to bring the daughter out for the wedding, but his ex-wife comes too. The two of them get together, and what you do in life, basically is settle for less. Anyway, I don't know if I'll ever write it because the movie business has shifted. At the time I was writing the trilogy, it was standard that if the musical was a hit on Broadway, they would make a movie out of it, but that doesn't happen anymore.
As of 2013 no third novel has resulted.

Alcatraz Morgue

Alcatraz Morgue is the morgue on Alcatraz Island, off the coast of San Francisco, USA. It is located on the northwestern side of the island towards the centre, half way between the Water Tower and the Dining Hall, below the side of the Recreation Yard.
Architecture.
The morgue was built in 1910 by the U.S. military on a site which was formally the entrance to a tunnel which was used by soldiers from the 1870s to cross to the opposite side of the island. It is described as "one of the simplest expressions of the mission revival style on Alcatraz." The morgue was built with three vaults and an examination table, with a steel door and a grated skylight. The double-door is a mint green color and is padlocked. The examination table is now covered with moss and in poor condition.
Use.
The morgue was only documented to have been used once when a deceased prisoner was stored in it overnight, having missed the last boat run to the mainland of the day. The examination table was never used to conduct an autopsy.
During its use by the U.S. Army, deceased officers were originally taken to Angel Island and military cemetery on Angel Island, but after its closure in the early 1900s, officers would then be taken to the San Francisco National Cemetery in the Presidio of San Francisco. During Alcatraz's use as a Federal penitentiary from 1934 to 1963, deceased inmates were taken to the San Francisco County Coroner on the mainland.

Schifffahrtsgesellschaft des Vierwaldstättersees

The Schifffahrtsgesellschaft des Vierwaldstättersees or Lake Lucerne Navigation Company (commonly abbreviated to SGV) is a public Swiss company operating passenger ships and boats on Lake Lucerne. The company is based in the city of Lucerne, and its origins can be traced back to 1836. Today it is the largest inland shipping company in Switzerland, and is notable for operating a number of historic paddle steamers, in addition to more modern motor vessels.
The company provides public transport routes to 32 places along the shore of the lake, with interchange to both main line and mountain railways at various points. Whilst much usage of these services is tourist or leisure oriented, the company also continues to provide practical public transport links between the smaller lakeside communities.
The company also owns its own shipyard, Shiptec Lucerne, which undertakes new build and rebuild work both for the SGV and for other shipping companies.
History.
Lake Lucerne has formed an important part of Switzerland's transport system for many centuries, and at least since the opening of the first track across the Gotthard Pass in 1230. This trade grew with the opening of a new mail coach road across the pass in 1830. This road had its northern terminus at Flüelen at the extreme eastern end of the lake, and the lake provided the only practical onward link to the cities of northern Switzerland.
In 1835, Casimir Friedrich Knörr decided to take advantage of the growing trade on Lake Lucerne by forming a steamship company and building a paddle steamer, the Stadt Luzern of 1837. His service began operating in 1837, although political pressure by the watermens guilds prevented it operating into the canton of Uri, and hence to Flüelen, for the first year of its operation.
Once this vessel showed the way, various other steamship companies were established. Eventually this led to price cutting, and several steamboat companies failed, or were merged into their rivals. In 1870, the two oldest and largest companies merged to form the "Vereinigten Dampfschiffgesellschaft des Vierwaldstättersees" (United Steamboat Company of Lake Lucerne). In 1885, this was renamed the "Dampfschiffgesellschaft des Vierwaldstättersees" (Steamship Company of Lake Lucerne; DGV), and in 1960 it became the SGV.
Fleet.
A fleet of 21 passenger ships, including five historical paddle steamers and 16 motor vessels of various ages and sizes is operated by the Schifffahrtsgesellschaft des Vierwaldstättersees. SGV's flagship is the paddle steamer "Stadt Luzern".
Routes.
The SGV operates several routes, with many variants, on Lake Lucerne. The following places are served, listed here in clockwise order around the lake shore from Lucerne:
Not all services serve all stops, nor are they necessarily served in the order presented above.
The SGV operates both historic paddle steamers and more modern motor vessels on its scheduled services. Whilst either kind of ship may operate an individual service, the company publishes in advance those services for which it is planning to use paddle steamers.
The SGV services are well integrated with other public transport and tourist services. The landing stages at Lucerne and Flüelen provide 'cross-quay' interchange with the main line railways at Lucerne station and Flüelen station respectively. Similar links are available to the Pilatus rack railway at Alpnachstad station, the Vitznau–Rigi rack railway at Vitznau, the Treib–Seelisberg funicular at Treib and the Bürgenstock funicular at Kehrsiten-Bürgenstock.
The interchange at Flüelen forms a key part of the William Tell Express, a tourist oriented combined paddle steamer and rail service that connects Lucerne and Locarno. The SGV provides the link from Lucerne to Flüelen, connecting there with a Swiss Federal Railways train to Locarno.

Lada XRAY is a concept car by AvtoVAZ. It was presented in August 2012 during the Moscow International Automobile Salon. It is designed by Steve Mattin.
Overview.
The prototype was produced by Vercarmodel Saro in Italy, at a cost of $1,000,000. The crossover receives an equally edgy styling complete with a leather coated seating arrangement, along with a futuristic dashboard and infotainment system. It has a stylish exterior, featuring a pair of long and thin headlights. The front grille looks almost like an “X” when you look at it. It was assumed that it will have a small 4- or 6-cylinder engine, as it is an economy model".
As it sits, the Xray is still in concept form, but it is possible that we could see the new design style in the lineup (BM-Hatch, B-Cross and LADA B), which will be carried out in the years 2015-2016 as early as 2015. AvtoVaz gave no details of SUV’s powertrain. AutoVAZ hopes that Mattin's expertise will bring the brand to the forefront of the Russian market beginning with their all-new concept.
The name has two meanings: as an X-Ray (a form of electromagnetic radiation) and as an abbreviation (X - crossover class, "Recreation", "Activity", "Youth").
Reaction.
According to Justin Cupler of "TopSpeed", Lada kept its Lada XRAY SUV under "such tight lock and key that it took all of us aback when it was debuted at the Moscow Motor Show". And it was mentioned that Lada XRAY’s cabin also continues the progressive design of the exterior.

A Protégée of the Mistress

A Protégée of the Mistress ("Vospitannitsa", Воспитанница; also, "The Ward Girl") is a play by Alexander Ostrovsky, first published in the #1, January 1859 issue of "Biblioteka Dlya Chteniya". In October 1859 it was banned from being staged by Imperial theatres, and was premiered in Maly Theatre, Moscow, on October 21, 1863.
History.
Ostrovsky conceived "A Protégée of the Mistress" in 1855 as a play in two acts. On July 12 of that year he made a rough draft of Act 1 and compiled the list of characters, but the next day stopped working upon it. Some characters of this initial version, like retired official Zakhar Zveroboyev and merchant Savva Bruskov, were later excluded from the scheme. The original title of the play was "Game for a Cat, Tears for a Mouse" (Koshke igrushki, myshke slyozki), with a subtitle "Pictures of Rural Life".
In an April 21 letter to Alexander Druzhinin Ostrovsky promised to finish it quick and bring to Saint Petersburg but this promise remained unfulfilled. The play was finished only on December 7, 1858 but continued to be changed by the author for months to come. On September 26, 1859, "A Protégée of the Mistress" was approved by the Theatre and Literature committee but not unanimously: the chairman S.P.Zhikharev and A.G.Rogchev voted against. Ostrovsky's friend Ivan Gorbunov warned the author that this was a bad sign and proved to be right: on October 23 the play was banned by the Third Department head Alexander Timashev after a censor in his report poised a question: "Should we indeed give way to a play showing such immorality in Russian landowners’ daily life?" In 1861 Fyodor Burdin made an unsuccessful attempt to persuade censors to lift the ban. The then chief of the Third Section of His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery L.A.Potapov refused to grant the permission, explaining: "Would it be sensible now to speak of serfdom and all the violations to it? Dvoryanstvo here is being presented in such an awful way. It's got dumped down these days enough to be killed off by being portrayed in such a way on stage. Besides, there'll be elections in Moscow, dvoryanstvo might be offended." When Burdin argued that neither dvoryanstvo nor serfdom have been touched in the play in any way, Potapov retorted: "Sure, things are not being said there directly, but we are not that simple not to be able to see between the lines."
Reception.
The play was greeted warmly by the literary left. In a letter to Pavel Annenkov (dated January 29, 1859) Saltykov-Shchedrin wrote: "Ostrovsky's scenery is marvellous and the whole idea behind it is great". Nikolai Dobrolyubov, reviewing the play in 1859, called it 'quite remarkable'. The critic noted how restrained and guarded the author was in showing the ugly sides of the main heroine's character. "This work is totally devoid of angular and rude features which usually are the result of authors' conscious attempts to show how ugly and vulgar their subject of hatred is. But ths play is remarkable for its calm, moderate tone," he wrote. Dobrolyubov was especially delighted with Nadya character. "In Ostrovsky's play her emotions are portrayed with enormous force and clarity. There is no other portrait of such depth in the whole of the Russian literature," he argued.
Critics from the literary left accepted Dobrolyubov's essay as a major yardstick and for years expressed nothing but agreement with his opinions. "How much does this little drama say, what lively characters and scenes are being presented here for a viewer's imagination," marveled otherwise uncompromisingly harsh Dmitry Pisarev in his "Scholastics of the XIX Century" (1861). Russian liberal press took to it less kindly. Critic N.D.Abdrashumov argued that Ostrovsky's style of writing was sketch-like and his characters except for Nadya amounted to little more than caricatures, "...filtered out from lums of human dirt of all kinds" and "making heavy impression upon one's heart" as the author was keen only to depict "the dirtier spots of life".

Seedcamp

Seedcamp is a pan-European London based accelerator launched in May 2007 by a group of 30 European investors that provides startups with seed money, mentorship, office space and support over a yearlong program. In addition to its accelerator program the company also runs initiatives to support the European startup community such as Seedhack and Seedsummit.
The fund now has a portfolio of over 70 companies and is backed by over 30 institutional Venture Capital firms and angel investors. The Partners of the fund are Reshma Sohoni and Carlos Espinal. Its current Chairman is venture capitalist Saul Klein.
Sky News has said that Seedcamp is "the largest and longest running accelerator in the UK" which is "backed by many of Europe's leading VCs".
Program.
Seedcamp's program consists of monthly events (mainly across Europe).
At each event 20 shortlisted startups gain an intensive day of pitch training, followed by a day of mentoring and then compete for investment from Seedcamp by pitching in front of venture capitalists and angel investors. The company will then accept around two to three startups per event to invest in.
The 2012 Calendar included London, Tel Aviv, Tallinn, Berlin, Zagreb, New York, Budapest, Lisbon and Paris.
Previous locations have also included EMEA and further out destinations such as Singapore, Mumbai, and South Africa.
Seedcamp typically invests €50,000 for an 8-10% equity stake. In addition the company offers its portfolio companies office space, intensive mentoring, a trip to the US and a "Founders' Pack" valued at €150,000. The company's main investment focus is capital efficient ventures or those based on web and mobile platforms.
The format of Seedcamp's program means that it is different from the majority of accelerators as it does not have limited application windows but instead opens up the opportunity for any start up to gain investment every month.
Techcrunch, a leading technology and startup publication, ranked Seedcamp as Europe's leading micro-seed investment fund and mentoring program.
Seedcamp Week.
The Seedcamp investment cycle runs from October to September every year, during which time the company holds an investment event in a different part of Europe and selects investments.
During September the company hosts Seedcamp Week, its week-long flagship event in London. All companies they have invested in throughout the year, usually 20, go through a series of mentoring days (Product Day, Founders' Day, Growth Day, Investors' Day) aimed to showcase their growth with the support of 400 mentors and industry experts. The event culminates with a Demo Day.
Seedhack.
In addition to its investment programme, Seedcamp runs an initiative to help budding entrepreneurs to get started in the form of Seedhack. Seedhack is a weekend long hackathon focused on a particular industry. Previous Seedhack events have included Financial Technology and Healthcare.
Wired said Seedhack “gives entrepreneurs critical insight into the specific challenges that industry needs to address. Meanwhile the corporates can tap into a sort of external R&D department.” 
Seedsummit.
Seedsummit, the second initiative run by the Seedcamp Network, is a platform aimed at making it easier for startup entrepreneurs to find the most active seed investors relevant to their business.

Falcke v Scottish Imperial Insurance Co

Falcke v Scottish Imperial Insurance Co (1886) 34 Ch 234 is an English unjust enrichment law case, which also concerns English contract law. It sets out some fundamental principles of construction of obligations, as viewed to exist by the late 19th-century English judiciary.
Facts.
Falcke owned the first mortgage on the life insurance policy of the Duchess de Beaufremont. There were many mortgages on it. Emmanuel paid a large premium on the policy to preserve its value because he mistakenly thought he was the ultimate owner of the equity, or he bought out the interests in the policy that were in priority to his. He claimed he should have a lien on the policy for the premium he just paid, because otherwise the whole life insurance policy would have lapsed.
Judgment.
Bowen LJ held that Emmanuel could get no lien on the basis of his mistake, or his saving the policy. Falcke did not request it, know about it, or acquiesce in the payment. So the entire value of the policy belonged to Falcke.
Fry LJ concurred.

Lancia Urban Bike

The Lancia Urban Bike is a concept bicycle created by Italian automaker Lancia in collaboration with MomoDesign. Its manufacturers claim that the bicycle has been designed to account for riding performance and comfort while being minimal in weight. The bike has been described as rustproof, due to its parts being made from carbon fiber, aluminum and magnesium. Its frame is designed to absorb bumps, which abates the need for a suspension system.
Technical characteristics.
The bicycle's weight is less than 11 kg, and it has many aluminum parts. The gearbox is an 8-speed from Shimano, and the brakes are also from Shimano. The disc of the breaks disc is 160 mm front and rear with mechanical calliper control. The forks are aluminum. The frame and the handlebars are made from carbon.
Production.
It had been speculated in 2007 that if offered to consumers, the bicycle's price would be around £1,500 (approximately €1,900). It was reported in 2007 that the bicycle was available at Lancia dealers, with a price of €3,300.

Gallivant

Gallivant is the first feature-length movie by Andrew Kötting. Released in 1996, it was a "highly idiosyncratic" documentary. It recorded a journey the director took clockwise around the coast of Britain accompanied by his 85-year-old grandmother, Gladys, and his seven-year-old daughter Eden. Eden was born at Guy's Hospital, London, in 1988 with a rare genetic disorder – Joubert syndrome – causing cerebral vermis hypoplasia and several other neurological complications. The growing closeness between these two and the sense of impending mortality give the film its emotional underpinning.
Reception.
Gallivant premiered at the Edinburgh Film Festival, where it won the Channel 4 Best New Director prize. In 2011, it was ranked number 49 in Time Out's list of the 100 best British films.

Seo In-guk

Seo In-guk (; born October 23, 1987) is a South Korean singer and actor. He launched his singing career after winning the talent reality show "Superstar K" in 2009, and made his acting breakthrough in the 2012 cable TV series "Reply 1997".
Early life.
Seo In-guk came from a poor family in Ulsan who collected recyclables for a living. He started dreaming of becoming a singer when he was 10, after listening to rocker Kim Jung-min. Being a timid boy, the young Seo discovered his talent by standing on stage at family gatherings and school events. He studied Applied Music at Daebul University, and eventually started to audition at some of the biggest entertainment agencies. After being repeatedly rejected and told to lose weight, Seo struggled with bulimia but the vomiting only damaged his vocal cords temporarily.
Career.
2009: "Superstar K".
Despite the setbacks, he never gave up completely and in 2009 he joined Mnet's talent reality show "Superstar K". He was declared the music program's season 1 winner.
The spotlight came with a hectic schedule of recordings, photo shoots, interviews and television broadcasts, followed by chart-topping singles and albums. But Seo also had to deal with the negative consequences of fame, including plastic surgery rumors, cold-shoulder treatment from the three major networks for cable stars like him, and the unfair label of being an "instant star."
2012: Acting debut and "Reply 1997".
In 2012 Seo became part of the cast of homegrown jukebox musical "Gwanghwamun Love Song". He then made his onscreen acting debut with a supporting role in KBS's "Love Rain". Aiming to expand his career in Japan, he also signed with Japanese agency Irving Entertainment.
He landed his first leading role later that year, in cable channel tvN's '90s nostalgic hit drama "Reply 1997". Seo's portrayal of a teenage boy in unrequited love with his childhood best friend won praise from both audiences and critics. The drama brought huge fame and recognition for Seo in acting field.
Shortly after, he appeared in MBC's "The Sons" (also known as "Rascal Sons"), saying he chose the 50-episode weekend family drama because he wanted to watch and learn from his senior colleagues in the ensemble cast.
2013: Return to singing and first film.
Seo joined the newly launched reality/variety show "I Live Alone" in January 2013 (he later took a break from the show six months later in June, due to work commitments). He was also cast in the romantic comedy film "Police Family", about a girl from a family of policemen who marries a young man from a family of criminals.
But more significantly, Seo returned to the music scene in April 2013 with the single "With Laughter or with Tears". The title song is the first time he sang a soulful ballad, and actress Ku Hye-sun appeared in the music video, which depicts the agony after a break up. Ku also composed the music and lyrics for the track "Were We Happy". This was followed several weeks later by his Japanese debut, with the release of the single "Fly Away".
In June 2013, he was cast in "Master's Sun", a horror-romantic comedy TV series written by the Hong Sisters, playing Kang Woo, a former soldier who served in the Zaytun Division and after his discharge becomes the head of security of a shopping mall company.
In October 2013, he starred in his first big-screen leading role in "No Breathing", a coming-of-age film about two swimming rivals, alongside Lee Jong-suk and Kwon Yuri.
2014: Acting career continues.
He then played a dual role in "Another Parting", a five-episode miniseries about a man and a woman who meet in the final moment of their lives and spend one special day together. Produced by LOEN Entertainment, the drama premiered on February 17, 2014 on Taekwang Group-owned cable channel Dramacube (also airing on BTV and YouTube).
Wanting to try a different genre, Seo was cast as a young gangster in the 2014 action-noir film "Wild Dog", but like "Police Family", it ran into investor troubles and was unable to begin production. Instead, Seo headlined another cable romantic comedy series, "High School King of Savvy", in which he played a high school student and star hockey player who leads a double life when he's forced to take on his older brother's job as an executive at an IT company.
Music programs.
Seo In-guk's wins on Korea's televised music shows. "M! Countdown" and "Music Triangle" are aired on cable channels Mnet and KM, respectively.

The Panel is designated by the Secretary of State under Section 3 of the Holocaust (Return of Cultural Objects) Act 2009 to advise on claims made by former owners or their heirs (or in some cases, states or public bodies) for the return of, or compensation for the loss of, items that have come into the effective possession of institutions in the UK, for example artworks in the national collections. It deals with cases where the objects were allegedly lost through seizure or forced sales during the Nazi era, or through looting or other unlawful transactions during the Second World War. It provides non-binding recommendations for return or for ex gratia payments. 
The Panel was established in February 2000 by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport as an advisory non-departmental public body under the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS).

Manley Hall, Manchester

Manley Hall was a large house in Whalley Range, Manchester. It was a two-storey Victorian Italianate building with 50 rooms, very grandly furnished and with a fine art collection. It stood in of exotic gardens with artificial lakes and many greenhouses in which orchids were grown
The house was built for the wealthy businessman Samuel Mendel in 1861. Born in Liverpool of Jewish origin he was the so-called "Merchant Prince" of Manchester's textile industry, who made a fortune by providing the fastest export routes round the Cape of Good Hope to India and Australia. At the height of his commercial success he converted from Judaism to High Church Anglicanism, and became a significant local figure as trustee of St. Clement's Church Chorlton-cum-Hardy. When the Suez Canal opened in 1869 he lost his commercial advantage and in 1875 was forced into bankruptcy. The contents of the house were sold in an auction that lasted five days. In 1879 a company formed to buy the estate and turn the gardens into a public pleasure park failed after two years. Its most famous visitor was "Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show". The grounds were then progressively sold for housing and the hall itself finally demolished in 1905. Manley Park playing fields is the only part of the original grounds which has not been built over.

Lillian O'Donnell

Lillian O'Donnell (1926–2005) was an American crime novelist notable for being one of the first to introduce a female police officer as the lead character in a book series. 
She was born in Trieste, Italy but spent most of her life in New York. She studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, New York and her first career was in the theatre - as an actress on stage and television and as first female stage manager on Broadway. Until 1954 she worked as a director and stage manager of summer stock packages for the Schubert Organization. In 1954 she married J. Leonard O’Donnell.
From 1960 she published ten stand-alone novels. They varied from fairly stock murder mysteries to novels of psychological suspense. Only one, "The Face of the Crime", was a police procedural. In 1972, her first book with Nora Mulcahaney "The Phone Calls" was published. It brought back characters from her earlier police novel, but with the addition of the female lead. In total, 17 books were published in this series, the last in 1998. Each book focused on a single major crime and Nora's concerns about her personal life were intertwined with her working life. 
In 1977, 1979 and 1980 she tried an interesting idea in a separate series - a protagonist, Mici Anhalt, who is an investigator for a Crime Victims Compensation Board. In 1990, she moved with the times, following other women who had begun series centered on female private detectives. In total she published four books with lead character Gwen Rammadge, a genteel woman turned private investigator to pay the bills. 
One of the Norah Mulcahaney books, "No Business Being a Cop" was filmed for TV as "Prime Target", starring Angie Dickinson, Joseph Bologna and David Soul.

Rich Woodland, Jr.

Rich Woodland, Jr. (born August 5, 1970) is a former American stock car racing driver. He competed in the NASCAR Winston West Series in the mid 1990s, and also made two starts in NASCAR's premier Winston Cup Series.
Career.
Born in Templeton, California, Woodland made his debut in NASCAR competition in the Winston West Series in 1992; he posted three top-ten finishes in six starts in his first year. After two partial seasons in 1993 and 1994, Woodland ran two full years in the series, with a best points finish of fifth in 1995.
Woodland also competed in NASCAR's Winston Cup Series; the series ran combination races between Winston Cup and Winston West at Sears Point Raceway, Phoenix International Raceway, and Indianapolis Motor Speedway (in 1994 only). Woodland successfully qualified for races at Phoenix in 1993 and Sears Point in 1996; his best finish came in the latter event, where he finished 37th of 44 cars in the race. Woodland also attempted but failed to qualify for six other combination races; in 1994 at Sears Point he was involved in a spectacular practice crash, launching his Oldsmobile off the track and destroying it.
Starting with the 1997 season, Woodland shifted his focus from the Winston West Series to the ARCA Racing Series; he would run partial ARCA schedules between 1997 and 2004, with a best finish of fifth at Pikes Peak International Raceway and Pocono Raceway in 1998. Woodland also continued to run selected Winston West races in 1997 and 1998, and in the latter year posted his only Winston West Series win, at Phoenix International Raceway. Woodland started 21st in the event, setting a record for most spots gained in a West Series race to win at the track. As a result of his win, Woodland was selected by NASCAR to compete in the Coca-Cola 500 Winston Cup exhibition race at Twin Ring Motegi in 1998; Woodland finished 31st in the event.
Between 1999 and 2001, Woodland competed in selected NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series races. His best finish in nine races was 14th, at Daytona International Speedway in 2000. Woodland also attempted but failed to qualify for two NASCAR Busch Series races in 2001.

Gobron-Brillié

Gobron-Brillié was an early French automobile manufactured from 1898 to 1930. The original company, "Societé des Moteurs Gobron-Brillié", was founded by the French engineer, Eugène Brillié, and industrialist, Gustave Gobron, at 13, quai de Boulougne, Boulougne-sur-Seine, near Paris, in 1898.
History.
Pre-1898.
Eugène Brillié studied at the Ecole centrale des arts et manufactures, and then went on to work, from 1887 to 1898, at the "Cie des Chemins de fer de l’Ouest". Meanwhile, Gustave Gobron (15 June 1846 to 27 September 1911) started as director of "Godillot", a supply company to the military, but took up politics, and was elected to the National Assembly (France), from 1885 to 1889, at which point he created a car manufacturing company, under his own name. The two men went into partnership, creating the "Société des Moteurs Gobron-Brillié".
1898-1903.
Brillié had developed an unusual type of internal-combustion engine, with two opposed pistons within each cylinder. The compression stroke involved the two pistons approaching each other, and then the ignition stroke was subsequently triggered between them. The inlet and exhaust valves were also placed at this point of closest-approach between the pistons.
Mounted vertically, the lower piston in each cylinder was connected by a conventional connecting rod to the crankshaft, while the upper piston was connected to an overhung yoke, with a long connecting rod back down to the crankshaft.
Instead of a carburettor, a revolving petrol distributor was developed, with the quantity of fuel being regulated by a drip-feed. One advantage of this device was that a wide variety of fuels could be used.
The engine was mounted at the rear, on a triangulated tubular chassis, with chain-drive to the wheels.
By 1899 they were registered at 17 rue Phil. de Girard, Paris.
By 1900, the company was producing about 150 cars per year. The cars were also built, under licence, in France as La Nanceene, and in Belgium as the Gobron-Nagant, and Botwoods of Ipswich sold them in England as Teras.
1904-1914.
When Brillié left the company, at the end of 1903, the design was changed to use a more conventional pressed-steel ladder-frame chassis, the engine was moved to the front, and the fuel-distributor was replaced by a carburettor, but they still kept the opposed-piston engine design.
Around 1906-1908, models included:
The last of the giant models was produced in 1910.
A 1907 Gobron-Brillié fire engine can be seen on display in the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu in England.
1918-1922.
After the First World War, the company changed name to "Automoibles Gobron", and moved to new premises at Levallois-Perret. The design continued to use opposed-piston engines, until 1922 (a 25 hp model).
1922-1930.
In 1922, the design was changed to using a more conventional 1·5-litre Chapuis-Dornier engine, and was additionally marketed under the name of Stabilia, but it sold badly. By 1927, the company was producing about 250 vehicles a year, but by 1930 it was down to two, and the company was forced to file for bankruptcy.
Brillié's activity, post-1903.
Brillié had left the company at the end of 1903, to join the "Ateliers Schneider" at Le Havre (formerly the "Ateliers d’artillerie des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée", which had been bought by Schneider in 1897). There, he built touring cars and commercial vehicles of more conventional design.
Schneider progressively took more control of the company, and abandoned the fabrication touring cars, preferring to develop the utility vehicles market. In 1906, the Brillié company delivered its first Paris buses. The installations at l'Havre were not well adapted, and the works were moved to other factories in Chalon and Champagne-sur-Seine. In March 1914, Schneider took his automobile activity to the "Société d’outillage mécanique et d’usinage d’artillerie".
During the First World War, in December 1915, a meeting between Colonel Estienne and Brillié took place to elaborate a tank project. At the start of January 1916, Joffre gave the go-ahead for the project and, on 31 January, put in for a purchase of 400 of what he called "terrestrial battleships", armed with a 75 mm canon. This was the first French tank, the Schneider CA1.

Alcatraz Dining Hall

Alcatraz Dining Hall, often referred to as the Mess Hall, is the dining hall of Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary where the prisoners and staff ate their meals. It is a long wing on the west end of the Main Cellhouse of Alcatraz, situated in the center of the island. It is connected to the block by a corridor known as “Times Square”, as it passes beneath a large clock approaching the entrance way to the dining hall. This wing includes the dining hall and the kitchen beyond it.
Protocol.
Dining hall protocol was a scripted process, including a whistle system to indicate which block and tier of men would move into and out of the hall at any given time, who sat where, where to place hands, and when to start eating. Prisoners would be awakened at 6:30, and sent to breakfast at 6:55. 
The original daily menu, established in 1934, included oatmeal, milk, fried bologna sausage, cottage fried potatoes, toast, oleomargarine, and coffee for breakfast. Dinner contained bean soup, roast beef, gravy, string-less beans, mashed potatoes, and coffee. "Supper" was a meal that had pork and beans, cornbread, potato salad, apricots, bread, oleomargarine, and coffee. A breakfast menu is still preserved on the hallway board, dated 21 March 1963. The breakfast menu included assorted dry cereals, steamed whole wheat, a scrambled egg, milk, stewed fruit, toast, bread, and butter. Lunch was served in the dining hall at 11:20, followed by a 30 minute rest in the cell, before returning to work until 16:15. Dinner was served at 16:25 and the prisoners would then retire to their cells at 16:50 to be locked in for the night. Inmates were permitted to eat as much as they liked within 20 minutes, provided they left no waste; waste would be reported and may make the prisoner subject to removal of privileges if they made a habit of it. 
At the end of each 20 minute meal, the forks, spoons and knives were laid out on the table and carefully counted to ensure that nothing had been taken as a potential weapon. Prisoners were forbidden from talking while eating, although many would do so discreetly; escape plans were often put forward this way. Each dining table had benches which held up to six men, although smaller tables and chairs later replaced these which seated four. All of the prison population, including the guards and officials would dine together, thus seating over 250 people. The food served at Alcatraz was reportedly the best in the United States prison system. On the second floor was an auditorium, which was where movies were screened to the inmates at weekends.
Security.
The gun gallery was situated in the Recreation Yard and mounted on one of the dining hall's exterior walls. There was a metal detector outside of the hall for security purposes. The dining hall had tear-gas canisters attached to the rafters of the ceiling which could be activated by remote control, should prisoners riot or attempt to escape. 
The first warden, James A. Johnston, always entered the dining hall alone and unarmed, due to heavy guarding around him. Several riots did break out in the dining hall during Alcatraz's history. Those prisoners who were not involved in the fighting hid under the dining hall tables to escape possible retribution.
In popular culture.
The dining hall in Alcatraz has appeared as a scene in numerous films, television programmes and novels, often where criminals hatch plots to escape or crimes to commit upon escaping. It has appeared in films such as Don Siegel and Clint Eastwood's "Escape from Alcatraz" (1979), and "" (1994), which has a scene spoofing the dining room scenes of the 1979 film.

List of Korean War Air National Guard Mobilizations

United States Air National Guard (ANG) unit mobilizations began in Oct 1950 when President Harry S. Truman issued federalization orders, bringing ANG units under federal control. Eventually, some 45,000 Air Guardsmen, about 80 percent of the force, were mobilized. Initially mobilized units were deployed to Far East Air Forces (FEAF) for combat operations in Korea. Other mobilized units were deployed to Europe to reinforce United States Air Forces in Europe. 
Beginning in Feb 1951, mobilized units were assigned to Air Defense Command (ADC), Strategic Air Command (SAC) and Tactical Air Command (SAC), replacing or augmenting active-duty units. Later many ANG personnel and equipment were redeployed from their active-duty units as individual filler replacements to FEAF as required, being assigned to various combat units as replacements. Guardsmen began to be demobilized in Jul 1952, with their units being inactivated by the active-duty air force. Subsequently, the individual state Air National Guard bureaus re-activated and re-formed the units beginning in Jan 1953.

Otto de la Rocha

Otto Benjamín de la Rocha López (born 23 August 1933 in Jinotega, Nicaragua), is a well known Nicaraguan singer, songwriter and radio actor, best known for his characterization of the picaresque persona Aniceto Prieto.
Biography.
Otto de la Rocha was born to Benjamín de la Rocha and Graciela López in Jinotega, Nicaragua on 23 August 1933. Although he never studied music, he inherited his love of music from his maternal grandfather, Juan Fajardo, who was a relation to the father of brothers Carlos and Luis Enrique Mejía Godoy. 
He has been married three times and has fathered 10 children. He works alongside his current wife, radio actress Georgina Valdivia, appearing together in radio plays and television commercials.
Early life.
At 13 years of age de la Rocha travelled to the capital Managua in search of a radio station where he would be able to perform- even though at the time it was extremely difficult to break into the then newly available radio broadcasting.
According to de la Rocha in 1948 he began to find fame via the broadcast of "Voz de la Victoria" (The Voice of Victory) on an amateur talent program hosted by the well known baccalaureate Oscar Pérez Valdivia, after he began to listen to the music of Nicaraguan greats such as Camilo Zapata.
Pancho Madrigal.
It was thanks to this trio that de la Rocha was able to create one of the characters that would bring him nation-wide fame. After the three performed on a live radio program hosted by radio entrepreneur Fabio Gadea Mantilla, he was asked to read a script in the style of a peasant farmer- thus "Pancho Madrigal" was born. The program, also called Pancho Madrigal, was broadcast on Radio Mundial (Worldwide Radio), replacing the character "Tío Popo" played by Rodolfo Arana Sándigo who, due to health issues, was unable to continue performing.
The program was subsequently transferred to Radio Corporación where de la Rocha continued to work for 20 years. de la Rocha continued creating much loved characters, the most well known of which include Aniceto Prieto ("an annoying native", according to de la Rocha), Indio Filomeno (the protagonist of another radio program which is also broadcast on television), Filito, as well as La Chepona, Mustafá the Turk and Policarpio Matute among others. 
The character of Aniceto Prieto is much loved in Nicaragua, according to de la Rocha.
Due to his work on the program "El Indio Filomeno" de la Rocha was sued on three occasions by the then head of National Guard radio and television Colonel Alberto Luna Solórzano.
de la Rocha maintained that the program did not express the names of figures from the then present era of repressive politics in Nicaragua. 
He recalls that at Radio Corporación he, along with Carlos Mejía Godoy, ran a program called "Corporito" and 
The fine was for 10,000 córdobas ($1,428 USD at the time), which the populous helped to fund out of affection for the characters and actors.
Career in Radio Program Production.
After the triumph of the Sandinista Revolution in 1979, de la Rocha created a program called "El tronco de los mensajeros " (The Messenger's Trunk) at the recently opened "Radio Sandino", as well as an agricultural program for farmers. 
In 1982 he transferred to radio broadcasting station "Voz de Nicaragua" (Voice of Nicaragua) with the programs "La Palomita Mensajera " (The Messenger Bird) and "Lencho Catarrán ". In 1990 he and his programs moved to Radio Ya.
In "Lencho Catarrán", his current wife plays the role of "Lupita", whom his character Aniceto Prieto is constantly trying to seduce. He and Lupita together appear in various television commercials.
In his musical career, de la Rocha has composed at least 100 songs, although he hasn't recorded them all. His repertoire comprises only around 30 tracks. They include: "Una Canción", "La Pelo’e Mais", "Managua, linda Managua", "A Mi Mama", "Primera Dama", "Plutarco Malpaisillo", "Soledad", "El Peón", "Pancho Madrigal", "Lencho Catarrán" and "Amor Florecido", among others.
Some of his tracks have gained international recognition. His track "Una Canción" from the album of the same name was covered by Cuban singer Elsa Baeza in 1978 which gained her a golden disc in Spain; however, de la Rocha did not receive any recognition as the composer.
de la Rocha is currently living in Managua where he continues his work in music and radio.

Last Night (Lucy Spraggan song)

"Last Night" is a song by English musician Lucy Spraggan, from her self-released album "Top Room at the Zoo" (2011). The song entered the UK Singles Chart at number 70 after performing the song at The X Factor auditions which was shown on 25 August 2012. Following a rule change regarding X Factor contestants, it was pulled from the charts midweek as it reached number 2 but early sales enabled it to finish at number 11 for the week. A new version of the song "Last Night (Beer Fear)" was released in the United Kingdom on 29 September 2013 as the second single from her debut studio album "Join the Club" (2013)
Background.
Spraggan performed the song at The X Factor auditions, she was put through to herself to bootcamp after performing the track. Judge Louis Walsh suggested that the song could go to number one in the charts. Shortly after the audition was screened, the song entered the UK Singles Chart at number 70. The song then peaked to number 2 on iTunes. However, it was soon removed from iTunes by request of The X Factor producers due to an X Factor rule change. She was told to take down her album and informed that all other X Factor contestants this year have also been banned until the show is over, in order to give them the same level of exposure. Steve Anderson of "The Independent" suggested that it was removed because it was challenging the 2011 X Factor victors, Little Mix, for the number one spot.
Music video.
A music video for the song was uploaded to YouTube on 24 August 2012 at a total length of two minutes and fourteen seconds. The video was directed by Damien Reeves and produced by Melmo Films and funded by Live and Unsigned as one part of Lucy's prize for becoming the runner up of Live and Unsigned 2011.

Swedish general election, August–September 1887

General elections were held in Sweden in August and September 1887. Although they resulted in a victory for the pro-free trade bloc, 22 of its members were later expelled from parliament, giving the protectionist members a majority.
Background.
Tariffs had become a major political issue in Sweden during the mid-1880s. In 1885 a campaign for tariffs to be introduced on grain was rejected by both chambers of the Riksdag. The following year the issue was debated again, and whilst the Second Chamber approved their introduction, the First Chamber rejected them. The matter was settled when a joint sitting of the two chambers rejected the initiative.
In 1887 a tariff on rye was voted down 70–68 in the First Chamber, which went onto vote down all other tariffs. The Second Chamber then approved the rye tariff by 111–101. With it looking as if the tariff proposal would be passed at a joint sitting, King Oscar II dissolved Parliament with the support of Prime Minister Robert Themptander, and called fresh elections. The early elections in March and April had resulted in a majority for the pro-free trade bloc. Following the spring elections, some MPs attempted to delay a decision on tariffs by proposing that a commission of inquiry be set up. Although this was supported by Themptander, Parliament rejected the idea.
Despite the early elections, the scheduled August and September elections still went ahead.
Results.
Only 22.2% of the male population aged over 21 was eligible to vote, and the turnout of 35.9% was far lower than the 48.1% for the spring elections.
Aftermath.
Following the elections Olof Larsson, a pro-free trade MP from Stockholm, was discovered to owe 11 kronor and 58 öre in unpaid municipal taxes. This was in violation of the Parliament Act, and as a result disqualified Larsson and all others elected on the same list as him. This amounted to a total of 22 pro-free trade MPs, all of whom were expelled from Parliament and replaced by protectionist MPs, who now had a majority in both chambers.
As a result, the pro-free trade government resigned despite attempts by King Oscar II to persuade ministers not to. A new pro-tariff government was formed, and implemented tariffs on a wide range of goods.

General Elektriks

General Elektriks is the musical project of French-native keyboard player, composer, singer and producer Hervé Salters.
History.
General Elektriks is the brainchild of Hervé Salters, a French national and vintage keyboard player. Salters was playing keys for his bands and for various artists in Paris (Femi Kuti, -M-, Vercoquin, DJ Mehdi, etc.) before he moved to San Francisco in 1999. He started working on funk collages as he was moving to the US, using his favorite keyboards, a computer and a mic. There, he hooked up with the Quannum Crew (Blackalicious, Lyrics Born, etc.) and started sessioning for them. He invited Quannum’s own Lateef The Truthspeaker and Chief Xcel on a few tracks, then completed the 1st General Elektriks album, "Cliquety Kliqk". Hailed by "URB" as "Ennio Morricone for the 21st century," the album is a far out mix of vintage funk, hip hop beats, noir riffs and pop melodies.
After touring behind the album, Salters joined Blackalicious in the studio to work on "The Craft" and toured with them for over a year. Concurrently, he formed San Francisco trio Honeycut with singer Bart Davenport and drummer/programmer Tony Sevener. Quannum Projects released their critically acclaimed 1st album, The Day I Turned To Glass, in 2006. As he was touring with Honeycut and laying keys down for more artists (Lifesavas, Curumin, Jel, The Mighty Underdogs, etc.…), Salters started working on a second General Elektriks effort. "Good city for dreamers" was completed in the fall of 2008. On this album Hervé developed a more organic sound than on its predecessor, blending sampled/programmed drums, live keyboards, horns and strings in a more seamless fashion and putting them at the service of songs driven by his own vocal melodies. Released in 2009, Good City’s funky brand of modern psychedelia was spearheaded by the single ‘Raid The Radio’ and led to an 18 months tour.
Salters used the downtime during the tour to co-produce L.A rapper Pigeon John’s album "Dragon Slayer" and to get back together with his Honeycut counterparts to whip up a second effort, ‘Comedians.’ He also wrote and produced the soundtrack to a gangster TV miniseries for French network France 2, ‘Les Beaux Mecs,’ and did a string of remixes for the likes of Femi Kuti and Mayer Hawthorne. Hervé started working on a follow up to Good City For Dreamers during the winter of 2011. Written, arranged and produced in 4 months, "Parker Street" takes the baton where Good City left off and digs deeper into the organic future-Soul of its predecessor. Leaving programmed drums behind, Salters combines on this album the sonic aesthetics that come with tweaking in the lab with the radical dynamics that can only emanate from the live interpretations of musicians. Both lushly arranged and cutting, Parker Street brings forth an unapologetic mix of Avant-Funk, oldschool pop, raw Jazz and hip hop aesthetics.

21st Construction Regiment (Australia)

The 21st Construction Regiment (21 CR) was a construction engineer regiment of the Australian Army Reserve. Part of the 5th Brigade, the regiment was formed in 1950 and was based in New South Wales where it provided support to the 2nd Division. The regiment has contributed personnel to a number of operations including the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, Operation Slipper and Operation Astute. It also regularly supported the Army Aboriginal Community Assistance Program and provided assistance to the Australian community in times of natural disaster. The regiment was disbanded in 2013.
History.
The 21st Construction Regiment was raised on 29 August 1950 in New South Wales through the "supplementary reserve" scheme that used the resources of various government departments, including personnel, to raise a reserve military capability within the Citizens Military Force. The regiment's first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel Douglas White, a World War II veteran, and upon formation the regiment consisted of the 101st, 102nd and 103rd Construction Squadrons and the 108th Plant Squadron. The following year the 109th Construction Squadron was raised as an independent squadron administered by the regiment. At the regiment's first annual camp in 1951, a total of 29 officers and 163 other ranks paraded.
In 1952, the regiment was subordinated to the 5th Engineer Group, which was headquartered at Victoria Barracks in Sydney. A small number of regular personnel were detached to the regiment to provide training support. In 1958, the regimental headquarters was established at Haberfield, New South Wales. Throughout the 1950s and 60s, the regiment undertook various construction tasks around the country, moving between Middle Head and Singleton. Annual camps took place at Middle Head, North Head, Glenfield, Ingleburn, Holsworthy and Singleton. In 1968, the regiment was placed under the command of 11 CE Works when the 5th Engineer Group disbanded.
In 1972, the 109th Construction Squadron was redesignated 201 Work Section when its sponsor organisation, the Snowy Mountain Hydro Electric Scheme, was completed. The regiment returned to the 5th Engineer Group in 1975. That year the regiment deployed over 350 personnel to Darwin to clean up the city in the wake of Cyclone Tracy.
Two years later, further change occurred when 201 Works Section was redesignated 4 Troop, underneath the 5th Field Squadron, which was part of the 4th Field Engineer Regiment. This lasted until early 1980 when the subunit returned to the 21st Construction Regiment and once again became 201 Works Section. In 1987, the regiment was placed under the command of the 2nd Divisional Engineers. Later that year, the 103rd and 108th Plant Squadrons were disbanded and reformed as the 26th Divisional Engineer Support Squadron. Throughout the 1980s exercises were undertaken in the Holsworthy and Singleton areas; a major bridging project was also completed at Gladesville in Sydney with the support of the regular 17th Construction Squadron.
Up until the 1990s when a centralised training model was adopted, the regiment undertook its own basic, employment and promotion courses. When the regiment had originally been raised under the supplementary reserve scheme, its personnel had been placed under conditions of service that enabled them to serve with only limited impact upon their civilian careers. This was done by allowing members only to parade for one annual two week camp a year. These conditions remained until 1995 when its personnel became subject to the same requirements of other Reserve units, which essentially required members to attend weekly parades and monthly exercises. In 1996, the regiment was issued with a Unit Colour Patch that consisted of the purple background of the engineers and a red triangle. Throughout the 1990s, annual camps were undertaken in Rylestone, Shoalwater Bay, Holsworthy, Singleton, Port Wakefield, Goat Island, Majura, and Kapooka.
The regiment was heavily deployed since the beginning of the 21st century, with personnel being deployed on operations as part of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, Operation Slipper and Operation Astute in East Timor. The unit has also contributed personnel to exercises in Papua New Guinea, Rifle Company Butterworth, and the Army Aboriginal Community Assistance Program. Based at Holsworthy Barracks, it was currently part of the 2nd Division's 5th Brigade, providing "construction engineering, hydro-graphic survey and Civil-Military Cooperation" capabilities. In 2011, the regiment had a posted strength of 240 personnel and it consisted of Regimental Headquarters, 101 and 102 Construction Squadrons, Littoral and Riverine Survey Squadron and CIMIC Squadron.
In mid-2013, it was announced that the regiment would be amalgamated with other Reserve engineer units and would cease to exist. During a parade on 23 November 2013 the regiment was disestablished with its squadrons being merged into other units: 101st Construction Squadron and the Littoral and Riverine Survey Squadron were added to 5th Engineer Regiment, 102nd Construction Squadron to the 8th Engineer Regiment, and the CIMIC Squadron was moved to become a direct asset of Headquarters 5th Brigade.

<doc id="36883065" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36883065" title="Student Police Cadet Project">
Student Police Cadet Project

The 'STUDENT POLICE CADET (SPC) Project' is a school-based initiative by Kerala Police, implemented jointly by the Departments of Home and Education, and supported by Departments of Transport, Forest, Excise and Local Self-Government. The SPC project trains high school students to respect the law, practice discipline and civic sense, and develop empathy for vulnerable sections of society. It also strengthens commitment towards family, community, and the environment, enabling them to resist negative tendencies such as substance abuse, deviant behavior, intolerance, and other social evils.
The SPC Project was launched on August 2, 2010 in 127 high schools/higher secondary schools across Kerala, with 11176 students, both boys and girls, enrolled as Cadets and 254 teachers trained as school-level Community Police Officers (CPOs). In 2012, the project was expanded to cover a total of 249 high schools across Kerala, with a combined strength of nearly 16,000 SPCs and 500 CPOs.
Genesis.
The Student Police Cadet Project has its roots in Janakeeyam, a community-level initiative by Kochi City police, in 2006. During the event, more than 400 high school students from 30 local schools interacted with police officers, engaging in wide-ranging discussions on community issues and visiting police stations. During these discussions, the students expressed a desire to have a permanent arrangement for ongoing communication with the police. Accordingly, a pilot Student-Police project was launched on an experimental basis in a few selected schools in Ernakulam Rural District and later in Alappuzha District. Within a short time, positive results began to be seen among the student community, with significant improvement in academic performance of students, tackling of school-level deviant behavior by police with the help of students themselves, empowerment of girl students to resist exploitation, etc.
Subsequently, at Kozhikode in January 2010, a squad of specially trained high school students was entrusted with the responsibility of crowd management at Kerala School Youth Festival, Asia’s largest youth-focused cultural festival involving more than 10,000 participants. Following the successful execution of this task by the cadets, and in light of the success stories from project-implemented schools, a detailed proposal for a state-wide school-based training programme was prepared under the guidance of Sri Jacob Punnoose IPS (DGP-Kerala) and submitted to the Government of Kerala. On the basis of this report, Government of Kerala issued GO (P)121/2010/Home dated 29-05-2010, with the stated objective of moulding a generation of law-abiding, socially committed and service-oriented youth. A state-level Advisory Committee was constituted with Sri. Jacob Punnoose IPS (DGP-Kerala) as Chairman, senior Government officials as members, and Sri P Vijayan IPS as State Nodal Officer for the SPC Project.
Features.
The SPC project seeks to deepen the social democratic fabric of communities by evolving young minds into enlightened citizens who obey laws not by enforcement but rather as a natural and rational act. The Student Police Cadet Project does not create more policemen, rather it seeks to grow the policeman within each young member of their communities. The SPC project can be expected to generate significant long term benefits such as greater internal security, healthier and safer communities, and responsible future citizens of a stable democracy.
Vision.
A humane and just society where citizens respect and follow laws willingly, practice responsible behavior towards others, demonstrate empathy for weaker sections of society, participate in tackling community issues and resist threats to the natural environment.
Mission.
To unlock the potential of youth by systematic training and make them capable of becoming social leaders with global vision guided by humanitarian values.
Motto.
The motto of every student police cadet is "We Learn to Serve"
Objectives.
The objectives of the Student Police Cadet project are synchronous with the goals of the National Youth Policy of India which seeks to involve youth in the noble work of nation-building.
SPC training programme.
SPC training comprises a two-year programme with a focus on developing health and physical fitness, instilling social values, exploring inner capability and inculcating community living skills within students. There are five components of the programme, viz. PHYSICAL (OUTDOOR) TRAINING, INDOOR TRAINING (STUDY CLASSES), FIELD VISITS, PRACTICAL TRAINING PROJECTS and CAMPS.
Physical Training.
The goal of physical training is to inculcate discipline in mind and body of cadets, and develop in them fitness and stamina to carry out assigned tasks and responsibilities.
Indoor Training.
Indoor training is designed to acquaint cadets with Police-related topics, Matters of Law, Constitutional Principles, Community Policing, National Movements, Personality Development principles, inculcate self-esteem and raise self-confidence.
Field Visits.
Field visits by cadets are conductedto establishments that administer, implement and adjudicate the law, places of historical, cultural, scientific and national importance, to familiarise them with government institutions, and the administrative machinery required to ensure the Rule of Law.
Camps.
Residential and non-residential camps give student police cadets opportunities to develop team spirit and capacity for carrying out tasks, learn self-management, and spark a sense of adventure in them.
Community Projects.
Leadership capabilities of SPCs are strengthened through awareness classes and self-development workshops, and through community activities targeting issues such as road safety, drug and substance abuse, environmental protection, and aspects of law and crime.
Executive Hierarchy.
SPC Project implementation machinery comprises a three-tier structure of specially designated officials at State, District and School-levels.
State Nodal Officer.
The highest ranking executive official of the project is the State Nodal Officer - SPC Project. The SNO has overall executive responsibility for the project implementation, with jurisdiction in the entire state. The SNO liaises with District-level officials, coordinates with officials from other departments and reports to the State Advisory Committee on a regular basis. Sri P Vijayan IPS, a senior police officer of the 1999 Kerala cadre, is the first (and current) State Nodal Officer of the SPC Project.
District Nodal Officer(DNO).
In each District, a police officer of suitable rank appointed as District Nodal Officer for SPC project has the overall responsibility of project implementation in the District. The DNO coordinates with SPC officials to carry out various training activities, and reports to the SNO regarding the performance of SPC project on a regular basis.
Police Student Liaison Officer (PSLO).
Wherever there are SPC schools, the local Police Inspector with jurisdiction is designated as Police Student Liaison Officer (PSLO), with field-level responsibility of project implementation in the school(s) falling in that jurisdiction. PSLO reports to DNO on project implementation on a regular basis.
Drill Instructor(DI).
Selected Police personnel of suitable rank designated as Drill Instructors have responsibility to impart physical training to SPCs in the school premises on a regular basis. They are responsible for ensuring that the cadets attain a desirable level of physical fitness and stamina, and are capable of participating in formation marching and parade drills. The success of the SPC training programme in a school depends upon the effective execution of duties and responsibilities by the Drill instructors.
Community Police Officer(CPO).
Two experienced, willing and socially committed teachers are designated as Community Police Officers in each school. Each CPO undergoes proper training by police personnel, bears the rank of honorary SI of Police after such training, and is responsible for the satisfactory progress of SPCs during the training programme.The role of the CPO is key to the success or failure of SPC project in a school.
Project administration.
Project administration is carried out by Committees at the State, District and School levels.
State-level Advisory Committee.
This is the highest policy-making body in the SPC hierarchy, with authority to approve selection of schools, formulate guidelines for project implementation, issue directions to SPC programme officials, and ensure adherence to project guidelines by all stakeholders. The State Advisory Committee comprises senior Government officials from the various associating Departments, and is chaired by the State Police Chief.
District-level Advisory Committee.
Committee with District Collector as Patron, District Police Chief as Chairman, and District Panchayath Standing Committee Chairman (Education), District heads of Education, Forest, Excise, Transport, Local Self-Government and other departments as members in each Police district.
School-level Advisory Committee.
Committee comprising School Principal as Chairman, Inspector with jurisdiction as Convenor, President of Parent-Teacher Association, local representatives from Education, Forest, Excise, Transport departments, sitting member of Local Self-government body, Staff Secretary and Sub-Inspector as Committee Secretary in each SPC school. This committee has responsibility for overseeing and supporting project implementation in the school
Expansion of SPC project footprint.
The recommendation by the All India Police Science Congress (Dehra Dun, 2011) that all states implement the SPC project, led to a team of police officers from Rajasthan visiting Kerala to study the project. Subsequently, Government of Rajasthan decided to launch the project in selected schools as a pilot project. Several other states in India have also expressed interest in rolling out the scheme. It has also been reported that a nation-wide rollout of the SPC project is being considered at the level of the Union Home Ministry.

Mr. Nobody (soundtrack)

Mr. Nobody is a film score by Belgian musician Pierre Van Dormael, released on January 26, 2010 through Milan Records, accompanying the 2009 film of the same name, directed by Jaco Van Dormael and starring Jared Leto, Sarah Polley, Diane Kruger, and Linh Dan Pham. "Mr. Nobody" is the last film of composer Pierre Van Dormael before his demise in 2008.
Background.
Like Jaco Van Dormael's previous films, the score for "Mr. Nobody" was written by Pierre Van Dormael. The director did not want the music to be overtly emotional, so he and Pierre chose a minimalist orchestration, more often than not just a single guitar. The score was finished after Pierre was diagnosed with terminal cancer.
At the 1st Magritte Awards, the film received six awards and Pierre Van Dormael won Best Original Score posthumously.

Leuralla

Leuralla is a historic house in Leura, a suburb in the City of Blue Mountains local government area 109 km west of Sydney in New South Wales, Australia. The property is now the home of the Leuralla Toy & Railway Museum.
The owners.
Leuralla was built for the independently wealthy yachtsman and big-game fisherman Harry Andreas (18791955), his wife Alice and their young family. Harry and Alice Andreas lived at Leuralla until after World War II. In 1928, Clive Evatt (19001984) married Marjorie Andreas, a daughter, of Harry and Alice, and the Evatt family connection to the property began. Clive Evatt Jnr, an Andreas grandson, now owns the property and he and his wife, Elizabeth Evatt, are the founders of the present museum. They are responsible for the exhibition of H.V. Evatt (18941965) memorabilia and for the toy and railway collection displayed in various buildings. Herbert Vere Evatt was Clive Evatt Snr’s brother but had no particular connection with Leuralla and had a home of his own in Leura.
The house and outbuildings.
In 1903 a house, known as Leuralla, was built on the current site but was destroyed by bushfire in 1909. Between 1910 and 1914 the present house was built and the design was influenced by the work of Frank Lloyd Wright. The house is an example of an early 20th Century permanent residence for a wealthy family. It is an imposing two storey house set in extensive grounds in the Federation Free Classical style and is notable for its entry portico and stair, symmetry, and bracketed cornice. The walls and chimneys are rendered and the building is on a rockfaced sandstone base. Leuralla has a hipped roof with short projecting hipped wings on the southern and northern sides. The wide external sandstone staircase which has twin flights from the ground under a single storey portico. The portico is topped by a first floor balcony with balustrading. Doric columns compliment the entry and the front door is multi-paned and has sidelights. There are symmetrically placed hipped roof bay windows on the northern and southern sides of the portico. The roof is covered in slate and ridged in terracotta. The garage has Federation Anglo-Dutch style influences and its walls are shingled with a weatherboard spandrel. There is a single-storied sandstone outbuilding with a gabled roof on the Olympian Parade side of the grounds.
The garden and amphitheatre.
Andreas established an exotic garden from his earliest ownership of Leuralla and much of it was saved from the 1909 bushfire. It was redeveloped around the 1914 house and is still 5 hectares (12 acres) in size. A formal garden lay out was used originally by Andreas and later Paul Sorensen improved the garden overall. There is a sculpture garden on the south side of Olympian Parade. The amphitheatre on the edge of the escarpment takes advantages of its spectacular setting overlooking the Jamieson Valley.
Distinguished guests.
As the home of the Katoomba Music Society in the 1930s, Leuralla hosted numerous interesting musical guests including: the internationally renowned pianist Solomon Cutner , known as The Great Solomon; the composer and conductor Sir Eugene Goosens; and music critic and cricket commentator Sir Neville Cardus . During the 1954 Royal Visit the house welcomed Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and HRH The Duke of Edinburgh. During the 1927 Royal Tour of Australasia, Harry Andreas had acted as a fishing guide for The Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth) in the Bay of Islands, whilst the young Princess "Lillibet" was at home in London.

The movie was shown at different international film festivals such as Palm Springs International Film Festival and Seattle International Film Festival.
Plot.
Claire, a 70 year old woman, and her husband have a car accident in which last one dies. On the day of his funeral, Claire is reunited with Lut and Magda. In their late teens, the three were members of a rather famous music group, singing covers of Jacques Brel and other famous artists. The group split after Claire became pregnant. Claire also meets her youngest son Sid again. He absconded many years ago as his parent were only interested in their other son Michel who is now an overanxious man. Over the past years, Sid tried to become a famous R&B-artist but no recording company is interested in his work.
Claire seems to be aware she will not live forever and wants to go on stage again. She neglects the warnings of her general practitioner as she must rest to recover from a sprained leg and a concussion caused by the accident. Claire convinces the puritanic Lut and excentric Magda. She asks Sid to become their producer. Sid eventually agrees on condition he remixes the songs to his style and the group must be named "The Over the Hill Band". As Lut, Magda nor Sid want to invest money, Claire decides to buy all necessary equipment and rents a room which they rebuilt as a music studio. Sid hires two musicians. Artuur, a friend of Lut, plays the synthesizer. Not much later, Claire falls in love with Artuur and both start a relationship which is disapproved by Lut and Michel.
Michel neither agrees with the revival of the group. He is sure the aged women will only be ridiculed by the public. Furthermore he has his doubts regarding the costs his mother makes and her mental situation, the more when he discovers Claire sold the families wine cellar for a ridiculous low price. He also notices Claire neglects her housekeeping and forgets meetings with her doctor. Last one becomes very concerned when Claire claims she visited her mother on the coffee some hours earlier, although mother died many years ago. That's why he inscribes her for a mental test.
The rehearsels start and the three women eventually get the grip on the new style. Sid is convinced they will be a success and sends a demo to a talent show competition. Although they are selected, Lut and Magda want to quit due to personal reasons. Claire can convince them, if only it was a one-time performance. Michel boycots as much as he can, now knowing his mother suffers a kind of amnesia, most probably Alzheimer's disease, according the mental test.
Just before their performance on the contest Claire discovers Artuur is cheating on her. This is such a mental shock her Alzheimer gets the upper hand causing Claire to think she is 20 years old, her mother and future hussband are in the public and she is going to sing with the former band. The lights dim away and the story moves to a rest home some time later. It's obviously Claire does not recognize her sons anymore.
Claire stands up and the final scene starts: it's their act during the contest which is a huge success. When the act ends, the story goes back to the rest home where Claire takes her seat again. Although Sid mentions his music career got a huge boost thanks to his mother, it is not revealed the act was performed in reality or only in the mind of Claire.

Siam in World War I

Siam, now known as Thailand, participated in World War I (also known as the "Great War") from its declaration of war against the Central Powers on July 22, 1917. It was done mainly to gain favor from Britain and France, the main powers in Indochina at the time. Siam's token participation in World War I secured it a seat at the Versailles Peace Conference and the League of Nations, and Foreign Minister Devawongse used this opportunity to argue for the amendments of the 19th century treaties and the restoration of full Siamese sovereignty. The United States obliged in 1920, while France and Britain delayed until 1925.
History.
Despite the failed Palace Revolt of 1912, the Siamese monarch's popularity among his people continued to plummet mainly for Army discontent for the caning of six soldiers that got into an argument over a woman with a group of the then Crown Prince Vajiravudh's pages (1909) and the establishment of the Wild Tiger Corps (1911). The reduction of Siamese territory, after losing Laos and Cambodia in the period 1889 to 1909, also gave cries of discontent for giving way for British and French concessions.
The Siamese monarch, Rama VI, saw the opportunity in the Great War to gain both popularity and full sovereignty. So, Siam sent 1,284 volunteer troops under the command of General Phya Pijaijarnrit to serve in the Western Front with the combined Franco-British force. The expeditionary force, which arrived in 1918, included 95 qualified pilots and a medical unit. The Siamese troops were the only Southeast Asians in the European theatre (except for the Chinese Labour Corps and 140,000 Vietnamese troops and workers drafted by the French). Amendments favorable for full Siamese sovereignty were provided in response to the small force sent by Siam in the war. Impounded German ships were given also for Siam's merchant marine growth. 19 Siamese soldiers were killed during the war.
Rama VI saw this also as an opportunity to promote nationalism. The flag of the Kingdom of Siam shows five horizontal stripes in the colours red, white, blue, white and red, with the middle blue stripe being twice as wide as each of the other four. The design was adopted on 28 September 1917, according to the royal decree about the flag in that year; the Thai name for the flag is ธงไตรรงค์ ("Thong Trairong"), meaning "tricolour flag". The colours are said to stand for nation-religion-king, an unofficial motto of Thailand, red for the land and people, white for Theravada Buddhism and blue for the monarchy, as having been the auspicious colour of King Rama VI. As the king had declared war on Germany that July, some note the flag now bore the same colours as those of Britain and France.
The last member of the Siamese Expeditionary Corps, Yod Sangrungruang, died on 9 October 2003.

A Syrian Argentine is an Argentine citizen of Syrian descent or a Syrian naturalized Argentine.
Argentina is the second South American country with the highest number of Syrians after Brazil. In the conflict, the Argentine consulate in Damascus received 40 percent more applications for visas.
History.
Most of Syrians and Lebanese emigrating to Argentina established in northwest. The Syrians and Lebanese were mostly hawkers and did not practice agriculture. Thus, not settled in agricultural colonies, but stayed in the cities in greater numbers than other immigrants. The plan Sarmiento and Alberdi for populate regions had emptied of indigenous did not materialize, as most of the newcomers chose cities.Between 1945 and 1974 migratory flows Syrian - Lebanese to Argentina are increased due to the civil war in Lebanon. Already in the period from 1975 to 1977 decreases again.
The first destination of these groups (Arabs, Syrian - Lebanese, Christians and Muslims) was the province of Buenos Aires and from there many expanded into the country, attracted by landscapes that resembled much of their land. So they settled in Salta, Jujuy, La Rioja, San Juan, Mendoza, Santiago del Estero, Misiones, Chaco and Patagonia. In these provinces were devoted primarily to agricultural tasks.

Musidora (horse)

Musidora (1946–c. 1968) was an Irish-bred British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare, best known for winning two Classics in 1949. The filly won four times from twelve races in a racing career which lasted from 1948 until September 1949. After winning once as a two-year-old she won her first three races as a three-year-old including the 1000 Guineas over one mile at Newmarket and a the Epsom Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse a month later. In the latter race she narrowly defeated the French filly Coronation, who went on to win the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. She finished unplaced in her three subsequent races and was retired to stud, where she had limited success as a broodmare.
Background.
Musidora was a bay mare with a small white star bred in Ireland by F. F. Tuthill, who had bought her dam, an unraced and unbroken mare named Painted Vale for 220 guineas. Painted Vale produced several winners apart from Musidora, the most successful being the colt Sovrango, who won the Chester Vase,the Ormonde Stakes and the Oxfordshire Stakes. Musidora came from the second crop of foals sired by Nasrullah, a talented but temperamental racehorse who became a highly successful breeding stallion, especially following his export to the United States in 1950. He was the British champion sire in 1951 and the North American champion on five occasions.
In 1947 the yearling filly was sent to the Doncaster sales where she was bought for 4,700 guineas by the Scottish shipping magnate Norman Donaldson. Donaldson sent Musidora into training with Charles Elsey at his Highfield stables at Malton in Yorkshire. She became the first of five classic winners trained by Elsey between 1949 and 1959.
Racing career.
In 1948, Musidora ran six times and won one race. She was placed second or third in the other five. In the Free Handicap, a rating of the year's best two-year-olds, Musidora was assigned a weight of 109 pounds, twenty-four pounds behind the top-rated Abernant and fourteen pounds behind the leading fillies Integrity and Ballisland.
Musidora began her three-year-old season at Stockton-on-Tees Racecourse in April when she won the Roseberry Stakes. She was then sent to Newmarket for the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course. Ridden by the Australian Jockey Edgar Britt, she started at odds of 100/8 in a field of eighteen runners. Unknown Quantity started favourite after being the subject of exceptionally strong support in the betting. Musidora gave trouble at the start, but once the race was under way she was soon among the leaders. Britt sent Musidora into the lead two furlongs from the finish and she won comfortably by one and a half lengths from Unknown Quantity with Solar Myth two lengths back in third.
In the Epsom Oaks a month later, Musidora was made 4/1 favourite against sixteen opponents, with Vice Versa on 5/1 and the French-trained Coronation on 6/1. Britt positioned Musidora just behind the leader Coronation for most of the race, and the race developed into a struggle between the two, with the King's filly Avila joining the pair in the straight. In a closely contested finish Musidora took the lead inside the final furlong and won by a neck from Coronation, with a gap of two lengths back to Vice Versa in third and Avila fading into fifth. The winning time of 2:40.0 was two seconds faster than that recorded by Nimbus in winning the Epsom Derby over the same course and distance two days later.
Musidora failed to reproduce her classic-winning form in her remaining races. She finished unplaced in the Yorkshire Oaks at York, the St Leger Stakes at Doncaster and the Doonside Cup at Ayr.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Musidora an "average" winner of the 1000 Guineas and Oaks.
The Musidora Stakes, run yearly at York since 1961, was named in honour of the Yorkshire-trained mare.
Stud record.
As a broodmare, Musidora produced three winners, none of them top class. Her daughter Wishful Thinking, sired by Petition, produced Heavenly Thought, who won the Princess Royal Stakes in 1970. Heavenly Thought, in her turn, became a successful broodmare, producing the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes winner Homing as well as Water Mill, who finished second in the 1980 St Leger. Another daughter, Musical, produced Finlandia, the dam of the St Leger winner Snurge. On 5 December 1958, Musidora was sold in foal to Tudor Minstrel for 7,000 guineas ($20,580) to American turfman A.B. Hancock, but was not exported to the United States. She was exported to France in 1960 but was returned to the United Kingdom in 1962. She was reported as "dead" in the 1968 edition of the "General Stud Book".

Stylops melittae

Stylops melittae is a species of the order Strepsiptera of flying insects, that parasitize various species of sand bees (Andrena).
Biology.
The female "stylops melittae" gives birth to a large number of living primary larvae, that are strewn upon blossoms.
From there they can be delivered along with the pollen at the nest construction of the sand bees for which the species is specialized. In the nest construction the primary larvae penetrate into the host larvae and molt into exclusively endoparasitic secondary larvae. These roam about feeding in the host, and after a few further moltings establish themselves in the abdomen, and with their anterior portion break through between two abdominal segments of the host's skin, where they pupate. The exit point lays mostly between the 4th and 5th, more rarely between the 3rd and 4th, abdominal segment.
There are substantially more females (77–92%) than males (2–23%). The females remain all their lives in this puparium where they will be visited by the males for the purpose of copulation. Therefore, the females release a pheromone (3,5,9-trimethyldodecanal) produced by cephalothoracic gland and attract the males.
"Stylops melitta" can emerge in two generations, but most emerge in just one generation, so that stylops-infested sand bees are encountered mostly just in the early months of the year March through May.
Influence on the host species.
"Stylops melitta" primarily parasitizes species of sand bees that use the blossoms of multiple plants (that is, those that are polylectic); sand bee species specialized for blossoms of a single or few plant species, are more rarely affected. This distribution regarding host specificity would not be expected.
"Stylops melitta" has a markedly variable appearance. The proportions of the cephalothorax of the female have a great range of variability and consequently at times sequences of apparently host-specific species have been described, that have since been subsumed under single species.
Female sand bees become parasitized far more often than males.
"Stylops"-parasitized female sand bees are sterile and express themselves in behavior and appearance rather like their male counterparts of the species. The pollen gathering apparatus is reduced, the abdomen is flatter, and also the coloration is reminiscent of male individuals. Furthermore the "stylops"-parasitized female bees leave the maternal nest a few days earlier than do uninfested female individuals, similarly as do healthy male individuals. The earlier flight of the infested females gives the parasite more time for the development of the primary larvae. "Stylops"-parasitized females are no longer active after they have dug out their nest, while healthy females then fly out to provide for their offspring.
The more seldom infested male sand bees are by their appearance less affected, but are conversely rather reminiscent of the female animals.

Jobriath (album)

Jobriath is the first album by the American glam rock artist Jobriath and was released in 1973. The musical style of the album suggests a cross between "Hunky Dory"-era Bowie, Elton John's early 1970s albums and some decidedly Jaggeresque vocals. Lyrically the album combines science fiction imagery, sexuality themes and tributes to female movie icons. The daring (for 1973) opening track, "Take Me I'm Yours" is an overtly S&M fantasy
"...take it out on me baby, I'm ready, for your troubles I'm expedient, you're the master, come on faster, to your nature I'm obedient..."
Other highlights include the glamour praising, "I'maman" and the risque closing track, "Blow Away":
"...and all the pretty boys lay in the passage of every song that etched its way from out my bleeding heart...blow blow blow away, blow blow blow away...its very gay to blow away"

Cowboy Serenade

Cowboy Serenade is a 1942 American Western film directed by William Morgan and starring Gene Autry, Smiley Burnette, and Fay McKenzie. Written by Olive Cooper, the film is about a singing cowboy and cattleman who goes after a gambling ring after they fleece the cattlemen association's representative of their cattle. The film features the songs "Nobody Knows", and "Sweethearts or Strangers", and the title song.
Plot.
As president of the Flagpole Cattlemen's Association, singing cowboy Gene Autry (Gene Autry) entrusts the sale of the association's large cattle herd to young Jimmy Agnew (Rand Brooks), who is so thrilled with the opportunity that he proposes marriage to his girlfriend, Millie Jackson (Linda Leighton). The next day, while traveling to Hays City with the cattle, Jimmy is persuaded to join a poker game by two crooked gamblers, Dixie Trambeau (Tristram Coffin) and Joe Crowley (John Berkes), who fleece the naive cattleman and force him at gun point to turn over the power of attorney authorizing them to sell the cattle. Ashamed at his blunder, Jimmy goes into hiding.
Back in town, the distraught cattlemen prepare to swear out a warrant for Jimmy's arrest. Gene and his sidekick Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) ask them to hold off, offering to go to Hays City to search for him. At Hays City, Gene and Frog meet with District Attorney Stevens (Forbes Murray), who tells them about Trambeau's crooked gambling ring, which is responsible for fleecing many ranchers. Stevens explains that the spur railway line on which Trambeau and Crowley operate is out of his jurisdiction, and that he cannot investigate it without the permission of the line's owner, Asa Lock (Addison Richards). Stevens does not know that Trambeau and Crowley receive their orders directly from Asa, the secret leader of the gambling ring.
Gene and Frog go to Asa's office seeking his help, but learn he is out of town. They meet his daughter Stephanie (Fay McKenzie), who hires them as ranchhands, assuming they are looking for work. Soon, Gene is romancing Stephanie, while her aunt, Priscilla Smythe (Cecil Cunningham), pursues Frog. The romancing is interrupted, however, when Asa returns to the ranch. Gene reveals the purpose of his visit and asks Asa to allow an investigation of the spur line. Asa refuses to cooperate, and goes off to contact Trambeau and Crowley, ordering them to hide out near the ranch. Unaware of her father's criminality, Stephanie tells Gene that she can prove her father's innocence, and soon gives Stevens permission to conduct his investigation.
Despite several attempts by Asa to have him killed, Jimmy finally comes out of hiding and rides to the ranch with Gene to tell his story. Later, Gene and Frog discover the gamblers' hideout, but Trambeau and Crowley are able to escape with the help of Priscilla and the Locks' Chinese servant and ride back to the ranch. There they learn that Asa sent Jimmy a false message directing him to Stevens' office, having planned for a truck to run Jimmy off the road. When Asa finds out that Stephanie is in the car with Jimmy, he rushes off to save her. Just before the collision, Gene jumps into Stephanie's car and steers it away from the oncoming truck, which then collides with Asa's car. As Asa lays dying, Gene assures him that he will take care of his daughter.
Afterwards, at Jimmy and Millie's wedding, Priscilla catches the bouquet from the bride as Gene and Stephanie look on in laughter.

Warden's House (Alcatraz Island)

The Warden's House was the home of the wardens of the state penitentiary on Alcatraz Island, off San Francisco. It is located at the northeastern end of the Main Cellblock, next to Alcatraz Lighthouse. The 3-floor 15-room mansion was built in 1921 according to the Golden Gate National Recreational Area signpost, although some sources say it was built in 1926 or 1929 and had 17 or 18 rooms. 
Between 1934 and 1963 the four wardens of Alcatraz resided here including the first warden, James A. Johnston. A house of luxury in stark contrast to the jail next to it, the wardens often held lavish cocktail parties here.The signpost at the spot shows a photograph of a trusted inmate doing chores at the house for the warden and that the house had a terraced garden and greenhouse. The mansion had tall windows, providing fine views of San Francisco Bay. 
Today the house is a ruin, burned down during the AIM (American Indian Movement) Occupation of Alcatraz on June 1, 1970. Like many sites on the island, the house is reputed to be haunted. Several guards reported seeing the spectre of a man with mutton-chop sideburns during a party wearing a gray suit and brimmed cap, leaving the room icy cold and extinguishing the fire in the Ben Franklin stove.

Free Radio 80s

Free Radio 80s is an Independent Local Radio station serving the Birmingham, Coventry, Shropshire and Black Country areas, broadcasting on medium wave and DAB. The station, owned and operated by Orion Media, was launched on Monday 4 September 2012, and plays a selection of chart hits from the 1980s alongside live football commentaries and local news & information.
History.
Orion Media was formed in 2009, following the purchase of five Midlands-based radio stations - namely BRMB, Mercia, Wyvern, Beacon and Heart 106 from Global Radio for a sale price worth £37.5 million. In early 2012, Orion announced plans to rebrand BRMB, Beacon, Mercia and Wyvern into one station as a means of generating greater revenue. They were renamed as Free Radio on 26 March 2012. Many of these stations had previously operated an AM-based Gold service, all of which had been subsumed over time into Global's Gold network - Orion continued to run the AM stations as part of the Gold network on a franchise agreement, albeit with additional local opt-outs for extra sports coverage, including live football commentaries.
On 24 May 2012, Orion Media announced it would relaunch its Gold West Midlands stations on AM frequencies and DAB as "Free Radio 80s". Gold was replaced by test transmissions for Free Radio 80s in the final week of August, and was officially launched on 4 September 2012.
Sports coverage.
Up until the rebrand of the FM stations, BRMB, Beacon and Mercia broadcast live football commentaries on Aston Villa, Birmingham City, Coventry City, West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers matches, under the "Goalzone" strand. The commentaries were subsequently moved to "Gold", six months before the launch of Free Radio 80s. 
The station's frequencies are split to provide more localised coverage of the region's teams:
In addition to commentaries, the station also airs a magazine show, "The Sports Bar" on Monday evenings and a Friday night football phone-in.

Trafford General Hospital is a district general hospital in Davyhulme, providing services to a population of over 200,000 in the borough of Trafford, Greater Manchester. It employs just under 1,450 staff and has a strong network of volunteers. Trafford Hospitals became a part of Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust on 1 April 2012.
History.
1926 to 1988.
Originally named Davyhulme Park Hospital, it was established by the Barton-upon-Irwell Union. Work began to build the hospital in 1926. When the Local Government Act of 1929 abolished the poor law unions, the hospital passed to Lancashire County Council. The hospital is regarded as the "first" National Health Service hospital. Known as Park Hospital, it was the location for Aneurin Bevan's visit on 4 July 1948 at the start of the NHS. 
Sylvia Diggory (nee Beckingham), then 13, was the first NHS patient. Before she died, Sylvia said: "Mr Bevan asked me if I understood the significance of the occasion and told me that it was a milestone in history - the most civilised step any country had ever taken, and a day I would remember for the rest of my life - and of course, he was right."
Since 1988.
It was re-named Trafford General Hospital in 1988 and controlled by Trafford Healthcare NHS Trust, from 1994 until 2012. It had 530 beds, 2,100 staff, treated 24,000 in-patients a year and 175,000 outpatient appointments. It was for many years the smallest NHS Trust. The maternity unit was closed in 2010.

Death of a Ladies' Man (novel)

"Death of a Ladies' Man" is the third novel by Scottish writer Alan Bissett, released on July 23, 2009. Set within the city of Glasgow, the novel follows divorcee teacher Charlie Bain's journey into hedonism and sex addiction. Bissett describes "Death of a Ladies' Man" as "a cautionary tale for women written by a man who is trying to say: 'Look, this is why we are the way we are. Understand but do not forgive."
The novel shares its title with Leonard Cohen's 1977 album, "Death of a Ladies' Man", and often includes quotes from Cohen preceding its chapters.
Themes.
"Death of a Ladies' Man" largely focuses upon hedonism, ageing, lust, compromise and feminism.
Regarding the recurring theme of feminism, Bissett noted, "You never write with a specific 'audience' in mind, but it does seem that women have reacted to the book more enthusiastically than men. I worried, when I was writing it, that women would accuse me of peddling adolescent, sexist fantasies. Actually, all of the flak has come from men. I think they feel a bit accused by it. I know a guy who said it 'traumatised' him! Women, on the other hand, totally get it, and feel it’s a book which is generally on their side. I’m happy at that result." Bissett also noted, "Modern man is fucked up, modern men really are in a terrible state. I realised that to an even greater degree during the course of the book. I actually wonder whether feminism has had any impact on men at all in the last 30 or 40 years."
Writing and Influences.
According to Bissett, "the whole story of "Death of a Ladies’ Man" appeared in a blinding flash. But this turned out to be deceptive, as the first draft took about five months, while the redraft took three years!"
Regarding its typography, Bissett noted, "I like the prose to have rhythm, style and energy. "Boyracers" was supposed to feel like pop music. "Adam Spark" was supposed to feel like the speech of a hyperactive child. "Death of a Ladies’ Man" was supposed to feel like being on cocaine. In all three I was going for flash and kinetics. I’ve never really been capable of writing prose that just sits there on the page, functionally telling the story."

Regarding the construction of the novel's protagonist, Charlie Bain, Bissett noted, "I had to really look at the darkness. That was difficult. I stripped away far more layers of him than I initially thought were there (the absent father, the painful early divorce). I couldn't afford to write about this guy as if he was some moustache-twirling cad. I had to find the pain. [...] That's the tragic thing about him, the nobility is there, there are certain feminine values that should have led him in the right direction, but his cock takes over. We say that glibly all the time about men – their brains are in their trousers – that's what he needs to defeat and can't. He's trapped, sex becomes a numbers game to him, it becomes about engorging himself on women.""
Bissett has listed Bret Easton Ellis's "American Psycho" as an influence on his writing, acknowledging the similarities between principal characters, Charlie Bain and Patrick Bateman: ""American Psycho" was an enormous influence on me. I think it’s a brave, visionary masterpiece that absolutely blew open the doors on what it was possible for fiction to do. And I can see the thematic connections: Charlie Bain and Patrick Bateman, to a certain extent, inhabit similar worlds on either side of the Atlantic."
Seduction community.
Whilst researching the novel, Bissett attended a party alongside Neil Strauss, author of "" (2005), and other members of Glasgow's seduction community. Regarding this event, Bissett noted, "That idea that sincerity becomes impossible, that all you have is a series of masks and you say whatever needs to be said, you use whatever tactic is required in order to get the target relaxed. That was a really depressing thing for me to see. Male sexuality taken to its logical conclusion. If I was in any doubt that the book I was writing was worthwhile, its value was confirmed that night."
Setting.
The novel is set within the city of Glasgow, making references to a number of locations including, Ashton Lane, The 13th Note Café, ABC, Byres Road, Nice N' Sleazy's, and many others. Regarding the overall setting, Bissett noted, ""Ladies’ Man" is a Glasgow book. I did feel I had a big Glaswegian beast seething around in there that wanted to come out in the strange, alien, beautiful, fucked-up way it did in ["Death of a Ladies' Man"]."
Pop culture references.
"Death of a Ladies' Man" refers to many Scottish indie rock artists, including: Idlewild, Malcolm Middleton, Frightened Rabbit, Zoey Van Goey, The Twilight Sad, Sons and Daughters and Y'all Is Fantasy Island. In 2010, Bissett noted, "I must admit, things are so busy now I’m not going out to gigs much, but I certainly was when I was writing that book. I usually try and catch up with what the following bands of muckers and comrades are doing: Burnt Island, Maple Leaves, Zoey Van Goey and Y’all is Fantasy Island."

Loan-deposit ratio

Loan-deposit ratio, also known as the LTD ratio, is a ratio between the banks total loans and total deposits. 
If the ratio is lower than 1, the bank relied on its own deposits to make loans to its customers, without any outside borrowing. If, on the other hand, the ratio is greater than 1, the bank borrowed money which it reloaned at higher rates, rather than relying entirely on its own deposits. Banks may not be earning an optimal return if the ratio is too low. If the ratio is too high, the banks might not have enough liquidity to cover any unforeseen funding requirements or economic crises. It is a commonly used statistic for assessing a bank's liquidity.

Drivin' (The Kinks song)

"Drivin'" is a track penned by The Kinks's Ray Davies. The song appeared on the 1969 concept album, "Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)".
Background.
Drivin', on May 1, 1969, was one of the first two tracks to be worked on by The Kinks (the other being its B-side, "Mindless Child of Motherhood"). In "Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)", Drivin' shows the protagonist, Arthur Morgan, convincing his wife, Rose, to forget all of her problems (and the upheaval going on in the world) and take a drive. However, within the context of the concept album, the song offers only a brief respite from the prevailing anxieties.
According to critic Johnny Rogan and author Thomas Kitts, "Drivin'" is based on real experiences from Ray Davies' childhood when his family drove from London to the country.
Release and Reception.
"Drivin'" was the first single pulled from "Arthur". Released in the U.K. and continental Europe (but not the U.S.), it did not chart at all, making it the first song by The Kinks (aside from their pre-"You Really Got Me" singles) to do so. The follow-up single, "Shangri-La", also didn't make a dent in the charts. Both appeared on the compilation album, "Picture Book".
The song was praised by AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine for its "lazy grace". Rogan praises its "convincing lyrics," "sumptuous melody" and the "amusing percussive touches" added by Kinks' drummer Mick Avory towards the end of the song. Kitts comments that the song's rhythm, as well as some of the guitar playing by Ray's brother Dave Davies, effectively simulates a "leisurely car ride up and down hills and around curves."

Karobes Limited was a leading British supplier of car accessories in the 1950s–1970s. The company was based in Leamington Spa in central England. In the 1950s it was the major seller of seat covers in the UK and had the reputation of selling luxury goods:
Karobes was listed as UK trademark 670281 (June 14, 1948, till 1997). Several items Karobes developed and successfully marketed like carpets, reclining seats or head and back rests were later adopted by car manufacturers and not sold separately. The company's catalogues in the early 1970s offered a wide range of products, from heel pads (for high-heels) to spotlight hoods, steering wheel gloves, vinyl roof kits and wiper attachments. One of the company's inventors, Leslie Morrison Keegan, filed several patents for head rests and seat covers in the late 1950s, for example
Other inventors working at Karobes and filing patents were Barry Arnott, Leslie Morrison Keegan, Thomas Vincent Keegan and Gustav Donald Possart.
In the mid-1960s a seat cover made of "wool tartan backed with ocelot velvet" retailed at £7 17s. 6d.
In 1969 the U.S. legislation made head restraints compulsory in new cars, and the European automotive industry had to follow. In 1973 the British Automobile Association together with the British Standards Institution conducted tests of head rests, and Karobes' "X10" head restraint was one of the only three models which passed the test (less than 45° head rotation, 32 km/h).
Karobes was one of several car industry suppliers in Leamington Spa. Others of relevance were Lockheed (producing hydraulic brakes) and Automotive Products (automatic transmissions). In 1968, Karobes was acquired by "Harmo Industries", in May 1988 by "Beaverco", and in 1990 by "Betterware".

Harold Frederick Comber

Harold Frederick Comber ALS (31 December 1897 – 23 April 1969) was an English horticulturist and plant collector who was to specialize in the study of lilies "Lilium" sp. The eldest child of four, and only son of James and Ethel Comber, he was born at Nymans, Staplefield, Sussex, where his father was Head Gardener. He was educated at Handcross Council School until aged 12, when he entered Ardingly College for two years. He did not excel academically, failing his Oxford Local examinations, but was noted for his keen powers of observation and a retentive memory.
Career.
On leavingly Ardingly College, Comber worked with his father at Nymans for two years, during which time he visited other famous gardens, notably Leonardslee, whose owner, Sir Edmund Loder, recommended him to Henry Elwes, who engaged him at his home, Colesbourne Park, Gloucestershire.[http://www.colesbournegardens.org.uk/about-us/history-of-colesbourne-park.html] Elwes admired his skills, and encouraged him to write an article for the Gardeners' Chronicle which was accepted for publication; Comber was just 17. Such was his precocity that at this same age he was entrusted with the management of the glasshouses and botanical collections when the older staff duly left for service in World War I. A knee injury prevented Comber himself seeing active service in the war, and he was eventually directed to 'work of national importance', namely hardening and tempering parts of Lewis guns at Earlswood.
After the cessation of hostilities, Comber joined Bletchingley Castle Gardens, before being sponsored by Elwes and Loder to study for the Diploma Horticulture at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, where he also wrote a paper on the sterility of Rhododendrons. He obtained very good marks: 100% in Cryptogam Botany, 96% in each of Botanical Nomenclature and Classification of Plants,[http://www.rbge.org.uk/the-gardens/edinburgh/seasons-highlights/november-garden-highlights/november-garden-highlights-archive] making him the ideal candidate for two plant-hunting expeditions in the Andes sponsored by the Andes Syndicate (a group of aristocratic gardening enthusiasts, including Lord Aberconway) in 1925-26 and 1926-27. Despite the occasionally extreme privations, and accompanied only by a boy guide, Comber sent back seeds and herbarium specimens of over 1200 species, including the Chilean Fire Bush, "Nothofagus antarctica", and several species of "Berberis" and "Eucryphia".
On completion of his studies and expeditions, Comber left Edinburgh to become head gardener for the McEacharn family at Galloway House until its sale in 1930. Later that year he made a plant-hunting expedition to Tasmania where, occasionally joined by Leonard Rodway, he collected seeds of 147 plants. On his return, he took up the post of manager of the Burnham Lily Nursery in Buckinghamshire which, owned by W. A. Constable Ltd., Tunbridge Wells, turned to vegetable production during the Second World War. After the war, Comber moved briefly to Exbury Gardens for Edmund de Rothschild, followed by another short stint with R. H. Bath Ltd. at Wisbech. In 1952, he addressed a Royal Horticultural Society lily meeting, attended by Jan de Graaff, proprietor of the Oregon Bulb Farm in the USA. De Graaff offered Comber the job of lily hybridizer, which he accepted, and he duly emigrated to Gresham, Oregon. Comber excelled at his work, rearing new strains of lily such as the Green Magic Group, reorganizing record systems and streamlining production methods, until retirement beckoned in 1962. He remained very active during his retirement, writing prodigiously and listing the native plants of specific areas for the Native Plant Society of Oregon. In 1965, he travelled to Sabah, British North Borneo, to join his son James for three months collecting specimens for the Kew Herbarium, incidentally enjoying fishing and hunting trips with the natives.
Personal life.
Comber married Lilian Bertha Boughtwood (1894-1962) in March 1928; their first son James (1929-2005), was an orchidologist affiliated to Kew, and their second son Richard was born in 1931; he obtained a PhD from Southampton University in 1955. Their daughter, Mary Comber-Miles, became resident botanical artist at the University of British Columbia.
Death.
Harold Comber died on 23 April 1969 aged 72 in Gresham, Oregon. He was interred at the Cliffside Cemetery, Sandy. [http://billiongraves.com/pages/record/HaroldFComber/737723]

With the free version of TeamDrive you receive 2 GiB of free storage in the cloud. TeamDrive 3 enables users to synchronize data between desktop computers and mobile devices (smartphones and tablet computers).
The software is available for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android and IOS with four account levels: Free, Personal, Professional and SecureOffice. Each account starts with 2 GiB of free cloud storage but can be upgraded either for free via a customer referral program (an additional 250 MiB per referral and up to 10 GiB total) or via upgrade packages.
Company.
TeamDrive Systems GmbH was originally founded in 2005 under the name "PrimeSharing Deutschland GmbH", by the software company "SNAP Innovation GmbH" in Hamburg, Germany.
TeamDrive Systems GmbH is a privately held company headquartered in Hamburg, Germany. The first TeamDrive Sync product was released in 2009. CTO and co-founder, Paul McCullagh, invented the Primebase PBXT transactional storage engine for MySQL used in the original TeamDrive product and Facebook. In 2007 Paul McCullagh was awarded Code Contributor of the Year by MySQL/Sun Microsystems.
A number of international Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have released their own cloud services based on the TeamDrive technology, including, for example, CloudBox by EVRY, AS in Norway, and Smart Sync by Hamburg Cloud.
Since 2005, TeamDrive has proudly hoisted the Data Protection Seal of Privacy from the Independent Center for Data Protection in Germany (Unabhängiges Landeszentrum für Datenschutz Schleswig-Holstein) which is also fully compliant with International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles.
Technology.
Data transfers between TeamDrive's servers and versions ≥3.0 of their client program use 2048-bit RSA key pairs generated by the OpenSSL cryptographic library. TeamDrive uses HTTPS when logging into your account via www.teamdrive.com.
Synchronized storage directories for a TeamDrive account are called Spaces and each account can have an unlimited number of Spaces. Each Space, and its metadata, is encrypted locally (for both mobile and desktop clients) and individually with AES-256 in CBC mode. The keys are then stored encrypted on the user's computer. TeamDrive's software allows for the exporting and importing of keys which is only possible after the client program authenticates the login.
TeamDrive's website allows basic account management but not space manipulation. This prevents the user from sending their account keys to TeamDrive's servers. TeamDrive does not duplicate user data.
Users have total control over the storage location of their data. By default all data of European users are stored on Amazon S3 servers in Ireland. By using another storage provider it is possible to store all your files within the borders of your own country e.g. using Claranet in Germany.
US residents can choose to download the US version which stores all files within the US by default.
TeamDrive's client software can be paired with local hardware to create public or private cloud servers which have no storage capacity limits. An individual or business would use on-site systems as the server space and the TeamDrive client to upload data and sync devices. Furthermore, users can manage other cloud services such as Amazon S3 through TeamDrive's client or connect to their existing WebDav & network-attached storage.
Technical specification.
TeamDrive monitors any number of local folders in the file system and synchronizes data between any number of invited Space members. This software can also be used to keep your own data in sync between any number of desktop, notebook or mobile devices. Therewith all current file versions are available to all Space members at all times and with any device whether online or offline (if the latest versions were downloaded prior to entering an offline state).
TeamDrive uses a consecutive 256-bit advanced encryption standard encryption on all files. Files are encrypted prior to being uploaded and remain encrypted at rest (while they are stored on the server), which makes it impossible to read any data to and from the server and while the data rests on the server.
Assessments.
Independent security comparisons as e.g. cloudsider (German only) or a comparison between TeamDrive and ownCloud which confirms the efficiency of TeamDrive.

Townlands of Kilcommon

There are 37 townlands in the modern civil parish of Kilcommon, County Mayo, Ireland. Some of these are:
Barnatra.
Barnatra straddles the parishes of Kilcommon and Kilmore at the lower end of Broadhaven Bay. Situated at a crossroads, its roads lead westwards into Belmullet and the Mullet Peninsula, northwards out the Dun Chaocháin peninsula to Glengad and Pollathomas, eastwards to Glenamoy and the Ceide Fields and southwards to Carrowmore Lake, Bangor Erris and hence eventually to Castlebar and Ballina some 80 km distant. John Healy runs a fairly large general store, shop and petrol station at Barnatra which serves much of the Kilcommon area.
Bellanaboy.
This townland consists of an area of , most of which is now enclosed around a fossil fuel refinery under heavy security which has been built on Irish government Coillte controlled afforested conifer plantation land by Royal Dutch Shell. The townland is situated at the most south easterly point of the Sruwaddacon Bay estuary. The Aughoose River, also known as the Yellow river flows through the townland on its way to Carrowmore Lake, the drinking water supply for the whole of Erris. Found along the river bed is the soft yellow subsoil which gives the townland its name. The townland has flooded many times over the years and people have been killed in these floods. In the 19th century the home of the Swift family in this townland was a well known house of hospitality where any travellers were welcomed for overnight stays as they travelled between Belmullet and Ballycastle/Killala.
Carrowteige.
Carrowteige (Irish: Ceathru Thaidhg) is a Gaeltacht village situated close to the end of the Dún Chaocháin peninsula. It consists of . It has a Catholic church, a national school and a shop. Comhar Dún Chaocháin Teo is based in this village and way-marked cliff walks start from here.
Cill Ghallagháin.
Cill Ghallagáin (English: Kilgalligan) is a coastal townland situated on the extreme north tip of the Dun Chiortáin peninsula in Kilcommon parish. There is a small village of the same name. It is a wild and rugged place of immense beauty overlooking Broadhaven Bay and the wider Atlantic Ocean. Notable for its massive microtoponymic collection and its ancient graveyard situated on the northern side of Sruwaddacon Bay.
Cornboy.
Cornboy is a coastal townland on the Dún Chaocháin peninsula. It extends in size. The village centre is now situated as far inland as the townland extends, close to Garterhill td. In the past the centre of population was based around the old chapel on the hill overlooking Broadhaven Bay. The people once lived further down close to Cornboy Pier but over the years blowing sand has moved the centre of population further from the extensive sand dune areas.
There is an area known as the 'Sandhills Settlement' which consists of settlement features, possibly cairns and middens where a population lived (possibly Iron Age). It is a large area consisting of large sand dunes and sandy beaches which sometimes becomes exposed after a storm but the next storm covers it up again with deep sand. The Gweedaney River rises at Portacloy and flows past the old chapel in the dunes into Sruth Fada Conn bay. The modern church is situated much further inland. Cornboy shares Knockadaff mountain with Garter Hill. Knockadaff was an electoral district of the Belmullet Poor Union and was a local administrative body of Erris. Cornboy was, at the end of the 19th century the most progressive village in the area. These days it has a community centre which serves meals at lunch-time and is a centre where some classes take place for local people.
Cornhill.
Cornhill is a village situated on Dooncarton Hill. It overlooks Sruth Fada Conn bay. The village itself has many fields of which most are used for animals.
The radar tower on Dooncarton Hill is situated directly in front of the village. Many have said that the radar tower is an eyesore and should be taken down but it is still standing. The Gaelic for Cornhill is Cnoc An Chairn. The village itself is a linear village with roughly 13 houses.
Glenamoy.
Glenamoy is a general name for nine Kilcommon townlands - Bellagelly North & South, Baralty, Bunalty, Gortleatilla, Srahnaplaia, Pollboy, Lenarevagh and Barroosky. Glenamoy consists of some of land, much of it blanket bog interspersed with small lakes and conifer forestry, some of it pretty inaccessible and remote. It lies inland from the coastal townlands of the parish. The Glenamoy River and the Owenmore rivers rise in the mountains above Glenamoy. The Owenmore river flows into Blacksod Bay, the Glenamoy River into Broadhaven Bay. Lace schools were one of the more common industries in the area in the past. There were several shooting lodges in this area where the landlords held shooting parties for the gentry in the 19th century. Nowadays, mostly small farms and football are the interests of the inhabitants.
Gortbrack.
Gortbrack td. occupies a large section of the southern side of the western peninsula, Dun Chiortain. It is in size. The Owenduff River flows through the townland It has much of archaeological interest due to its location along the south facing slopes along the coastline. There are many megaliths dating from the Neolithic period.
Gortmelia.
Gortmelia is on the west side of the Dún Chiortáin peninsula overlooking Inver Bay. It is in size. In the Tithe composition Book of 1834, Gortmelia was divided into three parts - Gortmelia Mills, Gortmellia Gallagher and Rookstown. Later in the raeable valuation Books the three areas are colled Gortmellia Mills, Gortmellia Gallagher and Gortmellia Houston.Today, the townland is in four areas: Gortmellia, Parkbaun, Ballur and Ballyhonry.
Inver.
Area: . This townland is situated on the western side of the Dún Chiortán peninsula overlooking Trá Kirtaan (Chiortáin's Beach). The Owenduff River which rises in Knocknalower td. flows into Broadhaven Bay through Inver td. In 1636 Michael Cormuck lived in Inver Castle which was built close to the shore. While Cormuck laid claim to much of the land in Erris, the Protestant bishop had, according to the Stafford Inquisition of Mayo which investigated the ownership of land in the county in the early 17th century, the "right of the sea all around Erris". The castle had fallen by 1802 and on its site today there is very little to be seen except its gate posts. Many cottages locally, now mostly in ruins, are constructed of particularly well masonried stone blocks, so presumably the castle was pilfered of its stonework due to population pressure in the years between 1802 and the Irish Famine some 40 years later. Several ships of the Spanish Armada and many other ships were lost on the rugged coastline of the Dún Chiortán peninsula over the years. The 17th century story of Brian Rua relates just such a story. This townland was the centre of sporting activity down through the years. Sports such as horse-racing and curragh racing were held at the Inver sand-banks. There are many megalithic relics in the Inver area. Its a pretty place on the southern slopes of the hills and gets a lot of sunshine throughout the year.
This townland features in the story of the Táin Bó Flidhais and an archaeological mound found in Inver is alleged to be the burial place of the unfortunate husband of Flidhais when left stranded by the Kilcommon Celtic hero, Chiortain, after whom this peninsula is named.
Owenanirragh.
Much of the afforested portion of the site comprises relatively young conifer trees under which there still exists a bog flora, albeit modified and species-poor. A substantial area of high quality, uplanted blanket bog also occurs within the site and this area contains many large pools. The bog vegetation is generally dominated by purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea) and black bog-rush (Schoenus nigricans) while the blanket bog pools are characterised by a sparse flora which includes bog bean (Menyanthes trifoliata), many-stemmed spike-rush (Eleocharis multicaulis) and pipewort (Eriocaulon aquaticum). The European distribution of this latter species is confined to lakes and pools in lowland blanket bog areas of Ireland and western Scotland. This area of bog has also a well- developed Sphagnum cover including some large hummocks of Sphagnum imbricatum and S. fuscum.
Pollathomas.
Situated on the Dún Chiortáin peninsula and also known as Poll a tSomais, Pollatomais, Kilcommon, Pullathomas(the most commonly used spelling) and Pollatomish, this townland consists of . Pollathomas village has had a substantial population throughout the years. The village straddles a small crossroads and has a lovely location with views over Sruwaddacon Bay. It has a post office/shop, a busy hostel, a couple of pubs, a national school and a sizeable population. The graveyard had a 6th-century religious establishment of St. Coman which was mentioned in the Annals of the Four Masters. When the Anglo Normans came to Ireland there were several slayings recorded of the new English by the native tribespeople. In 1585 during the Reformation Pollathomas became the property of the Protestant Bishop of Killala and Michael Cormuck who lived at Inver Castle was the lessee. Several religious settlers including the Augustinians, were driven out of the area during the penal law period of the 17th century. In 1770 Pollathomas and Glengad were leased from the Protestant Bishop by the O'Donel's of Termon, and Kilcommon Lodge, now a thriving hostel was built. Famine and devastation hit Pollathomas several times in the 19th century before the Irish Famine of 1845/47 due to sheer pressure of population. During the Great Famine of 1845/47 the little relief came from the Quakers when the response for provisions to be sent to the area urgently, was to turn down the request. The people ate seaweed and sea-gulls eggs. The landlord, James O'Donel was attacked in Kilcommon Lodge. He demanded that a police barracks be built to protect his family but none was ever built. He bred crows and nurtured them so that they would protect his property. Throughout the 19th century, evictions and proselytising were commonplace. It is now a quiet village, occasionally affected by the rumblings of the Corrib gas project with a couple of public houses (Maguires and McGraths), a general store and post office and Kilcommon Lodge Hostel, a popular destination for visitors to the area.
Porturlin.
Porturlin (Gaelic: "Port Durlainne") is a coastal townland on the east coast of the Dún Chaocháin peninsula consisting of . During the famine, Richard Webb, bringing relief for the distressed from the Society of Friends described it as the finest fishing grounds in Mayo but wrote that ""the only access by land is over a high and boggy mountain, so wet and swampy that it is difficult to reach it even in summer. There is probably not in Ireland, a cluster of human habitations so completely secluded from easy access..."". When William Bald had been carrying out improvement works in the Erris area in 1835 he recommended building piers at Porturlin and in Portacloy, claiming it would aid the fishermen of the area greatly. During the 1840s roads were made to the area. In 1886 the Roads and Harbour Commissioners finally built a landing slip in length at a cost of £204.00. The Congested Districts Board for Ireland erected a curing station for herring and mackerel in 1894. By 1952 the old pier had fallen asunder and was replaced in 1965 by Mayo County Council.
In February 2010, Pat 'The Chief' O'Donnell, owner of a fish processing plant in Porturlin and fifth generation fisherman served a contested seven-month sentence in Castlerea Prison for his participation in protests against the Corrib gas project which he believes poses an unacceptable risk to the area, including his own livelihood and that of all fishermen in the Broadhaven Bay area.
Rossport/Ros Dumhach.
In more recent years, Rossport has been the scene of conflict with the Corrib gas project and protests against same.
Srahataggle.
Srahataggle townland consists of . It is a remote village which is reached via a turn off just before Porturlin Village. In 2004 a road which connects Srahataggle with Belderrig was tarred for the first time. Commenting on the people of Srahataggle in the early 1950s, the Western People reported, "remote as these habitations may appear to many, there is no lack of worldly knowledge and cultural attainments and many of their sons and daughters have risen to important posts in countries beyond the seas".

Logic (rapper)

Sir Robert Bryson Hall II (born January 22, 1990), known by his stage name Logic, is an American rapper. He was born and raised in Gaithersburg, Maryland. He has amassed a large internet following and is a member of the RattPack, his group of friends that he works with. Logic has released four official mixtapes, with the most recent being the critically acclaimed "Young Sinatra: Welcome to Forever". He is currently signed with Visionary Music Group and Def Jam Recordings.
Early life.
Logic was born in 1990 in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Throughout his childhood, both his African-American father and Caucasian mother suffered from crack addiction and alcoholism. His father was not a part of his childhood, but they are in contact with each other now. Growing up, his brothers sold crack cocaine and even sold the drug to his father. He attended Gaithersburg High School but did not graduate. He began skipping classes in the tenth grade. "I started doing badly and failed every class but English, so they kicked me out of school, they gave up on me." Logic was expelled and used his free time to dive into pursuing his music career. In hindsight, he wishes he would have stayed in school and received a proper education and always encourages his fans to do so. “I remember telling the kids my old high school, ‘All you kids that are here today to watch me speak to you guys have people that actually love you and care about you that make you go to school.’ And I said, ‘There are people in this auditorium as well that have nobody, but you’re still here and those same people are stronger than even I was.’ So education is a real big deal.” Logic left his mother’s home at 17, lived with a friend, and got two jobs. Since then, he and his mother have drifted apart and are no longer on speaking terms.
Career.
Early years.
At the age of 13, Logic met his mentor, Solomon Taylor. When Logic was sixteen, Taylor brought him a large number of beat CDs to write lyrics over. In 2009, Logic was going by the name Psychological because, "One name that really stuck was Psychological. I just loved this word because it was about the mind and I knew that's what I wanted my music to consist of; something that really challenges the mind." He released an unofficial mixtape titled "Psychological: The Mixtape." under his original stage name. Later on, Logic opened for Pitbull, EPMD, Method Man, Redman, and Ludacris at a show in Maryland. Shortly thereafter, he shortened the Psychological moniker to Logic, which is the science of reasoning, to broaden his horizons.
2010–2012: Various mixtapes.
On December 17, 2010, Logic released his first official mixtape, "Young, Broke, and Infamous". Following its release, he dropped two music videos from the project, "Stain in the Game," and "BackPack". The mixtape caught the ear of Chris Zarou, who wanted Logic to be a part of his upstart independent record label Visionary Music Group.
Logic released his second mixtape, "Young Sinatra", on September 19, 2011. "Young Sinatra" received a mass amount of positive feedback from multiple sources including XXL. He released music videos for songs such as "Mind of Logic,", "All I Do" and "Prime". The All I Do video was the first for Logic to hit over one million views on YouTube. On March 15, 2012, Billboard declared Logic as the Next Big Sound, meaning he was the fastest accelerating artist across the internet gaining fans. On March 20, 2012, Logic officially signed with Visionary Music Group. Logic stated in an interview, "Visionary Music Group is like Roc-A-Fella. Damon Dash, that's like Chris Zarou of Visionary Music Group, I like to see myself as a Jay. In no way am I arrogant or cocky, I have to see it in order to do it. They did it independent and when they signed with a major, they did it the way that they wanted to do it."
Logic released his third mixtape, "Young Sinatra: Undeniable" on April 30, 2012. On the mixtape, Logic addresses such topics as his future, his fans in various parts of the world, his father's drug use, getting kicked out of school, and his mother getting stabbed. The overall sound is on a bigger level than his previous work and does an outstanding job at showing his versatility. "Fans tend to think that if you fall in love with an artist because he makes this kind of sound and then he gets bigger and he grows and he starts to make a different sound, 'He's changing on us.' But with me, I created all types of sounds from the get go, so you can never say I'm changing, you can never say I'm going mainstream or I'm selling out." In an interview, Logic states, "There's stuff on there for the motherfuckers that don't pay attention to lyrics and just want to have fun, but every line is constructed with such depth that the real lyricists and nitpickers have something to listen to and analyze as well." One of Logic's main goals for his music is to make music with a positive message, telling people to follow their dreams, whatever it may be, all while walking with honor and peace. In July/August 2012, Logic completed his first national headlining tour, the Visionary Music Group Tour, along with Tayyib Ali.
2013–present: Def Jam signing and "Young Sinatra: Welcome to Forever".
Beginning in early 2013 Logic started working on his fourth official mixtape. Logic completed his first European tour March 2013, which included stops in Amsterdam, Belgium, Switzerland, and London. His fourth mixtape, "", was shortly after slated to release May 7, 2013. Logic also announced his second headlining national tour, The Welcome to Forever Tour, in support of his upcoming mixtape. In early 2013, Logic was featured on the cover of XXL, as part of its annual "Top 10 Freshmen List", along with fellow up-and-coming rappers Trinidad James, Dizzy Wright, Action Bronson, Joey Badass, Ab-Soul, Chief Keef, and Schoolboy Q, among others.
On April 15, 2013 it was announced that Logic had signed with Def Jam Recordings and that No I.D. will be executive producing his debut album. Logic would speak of the signing saying, "I'm excited to take this next step in my career. It's incredible for Def Jam and Visionary Music Group to work together and the opportunity to collaborate with a living legend like No I.D. is priceless. I'm very humbled to be a part of the most iconic hip hop label of all time." On April 23 he premiered one of the songs off "Welcome to Forever", "Nasty" which was produced by Don Cannon. Following his fourth mixtape's release, on May 14, 2013 Logic began "The Welcome To Forever Tour," which lasted two months. On May 7, 2013 Logic released his fourth official mixtape, "Young Sinatra: Welcome to Forever". The mixtape featured guest appearances by Jhene Aiko, Kid Ink, Trinidad James, Dizzy Wright, Castro, Elijah Blake and Jon Bellion. Production was handled by No I.D., Don Cannon, Key Wane, C-Sick, Swiff D, Arthur McArthur, VMG's in-house producer 6ix, and Logic himself. The mixtape reached 100,000 downloads on DatPiff in under 24 hours.
On July 15, 2013 it was announced that Logic would be touring with Kid Cudi, Big Sean and Tyler, The Creator on "The Cud Life Tour 2013" in late 2013. On November 5, 2013, Logic revealed that No ID, Hit-Boy, 6ix, and C-Sick would be providing production on his debut album, which is scheduled for a 2014 release. On January 27, 2014, Visionary Music Group released "24 Freestyle" via SoundCloud in celebration of Logic's 24th birthday. The track is the first time all VMG artists have been featured on one song. On February 11, 2014, EDM band Krewella announced that they would be headlining the 2014 Verge Campus Spring Tour with support of Logic. On April 8, Logic released a new song titled "Now," which was supposed to be on his upcoming EP titled "While You Wait". At the same time, he also announced that he would be embarking on the While You Wait Tour with fellow Visionary Music Group members QuESt and Castro. A week later, Logic released the title track of the EP. A week after that, he released "Alright," the third song from the once anticipated "While You Wait EP". The song features fellow Def Jam artist Big Sean. Logic followed this up on May 7 with a freestyle called "Finding Forever." On June 7, Logic explained plans to scrap the "While You Wait EP" project, and get straight to releasing his first studio album instead.
Personal life.
In 2009, Logic had come out of a five year relationship while working on his music. "You can put your everything into a relationship, but that doesn't mean you're going to get back what you give. When I created my first mixtape, I realized everything I put in my music — the hours, the lyricism, the time, the grind, pain, sweat, blood, tears — I get it back. I see it." He stated in an interview, "The thing is, I feel like so many artists, well, not really artists but so many people think they can rap and they just want a deal and the glitz and the glamour and the women but they don't understand that all I do and want to do is rhyme... I think I've sacrificed so much from my relationships to my friendships to my family; I've literally sacrificed my entire life and I'm honest."
Logic has referred to himself as a huge pothead when he was growing up. He has said recently that, "I don’t drink; I don’t smoke weed. I used to smoke; I used to be a pretty big pothead when I was younger, but I don’t smoke. I might have an occasional glass of champagne." He credits the way his family was growing up as his reason for not doing drugs. Logic believes, "You are not defined by the material you possess or the amount of money in your bank account, what defines you is how you attain them. "
Influences.
Logic first became interested in rap by watching the movie Kill Bill at the age of 15, for which RZA of Wu-Tang Clan did the score. He started listening to Wu-Tang and delved deeper into hip-hop from there. The first hip-hop album he bought was The Roots "Do You Want More?!!!??!" Other big influences include his mentor Solomon Taylor and friend Lenbo, who let Logic live with him and make music in his basement.
Although he is a hip-hop artist, Logic is heavily influenced by Frank Sinatra. As a child, his mother made him watch old black and white movies, which formed his love for Frank Sinatra and influenced how he represents himself with the way he speaks and how he interacts with others with peace, love, grace, positivity, honor, and valor. Because of Frank Sinatra, Logic says he does his best to carry himself in an intellectual and kind manner. Just as Sinatra had the Rat Pack, Logic has his RattPack (an acronym for "Real All The Time" and consisting of friends such as his manager Chris, his producers 6ix and OB, and friend/fellow rapper C Dot Castro). Logic describes Sinatra as a man who was, "suave, debonair, honorable, respectable, with valor and grace." Logic's female fans are also called BobbySoxers just as Frank's were. He describes BobbySoxer girls as beautiful, intelligent, elegant, educated, classy, hardworking, young women. Logic also refers to himself as "Young Sinatra."
Logic has said that a never ending list of artists have influenced him including Wu-Tang Clan, Big L, A Tribe Called Quest, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Rakim, Drake, J. Cole, KRS-One and Nas. He has also stated that all music inspires him, including The Red Hot Chili Peppers, John Coltrane, and Miles Davis. He says that all the classic artists are what really gave him a foundation, but the newer artists are also his inspirations, and he brings the best of both worlds to his music. Logic says, "I love all subgenres within hip-hop and all genres of music and I think that's what allows me to make the music that I do, because of my appreciation for the music."

Model Industries Building

The Model Industries building or Industries Building is a three/four-storey building on the northwest corner of Alcatraz Island off the coast of San Francisco, USA. This building was originally built by the U.S. military and was used as a laundry building until the New Industries Building was built as part of a redevelopment program on Alcatraz in 1939 when it was a federal penitentiary. As part of the Alcatraz jail, it held workshops for inmates to work in.
On January 10, 1935, the building shifted to within 2.5 feet from the edge of the cliff following a landslide caused by a severe storm. The warden at the time, James A. Johnston, proposed to extend the seawall next to it and asked the Bureau for $6500 to fund it; he would later claim to dislike the building because it was irregularly shaped. A smaller, cheaper riprap was completed by the end of 1935. A guard tower and a catwalk from Hill Tower was added to the roof of the Industries Building in June 1936 and the building was made secure with bars from old cells to bar the windows and grill the roof ventilators and to prevent inmates from escaping from the roof. It ceased use as a laundry in 1939 when it was moved to the upper floor of the New Industries Building. Today the building is heavily rusted after decades of exposure to the salt air and wind. Today neither the guard tower on top of the building or the Hill Tower exist.

To Hell with the Kaiser!

To Hell with the Kaiser! is a lost 1918 silent war propaganda comedy film produced by Screen Classics Productions and distributed by Metro Pictures. It was directed by George Irving and starred Lawrence Grant as the Kaiser.
Made toward the close of World War I, this film falls in line with other films of this popular genre, "the wartime propaganda film", made at the same time i.e. "The Kaiser, Beast of Berlin", "Yankee Doodle in Berlin", "Hearts of the World", "The Heart of Humanity", "Over the Rhine", "The False Faces" and "The Unpardonable Sin" to name a few.
Synopsis.
Lawrence Grant who spent his lengthy career playing odious villains, appeared in the dual role of Kaiser Wilhelm II and his look-alike, German actor Robert Graubel. Terrified of being assassinated, the Kaiser hires Graubel to impersonate him at various political functions. In the film, the Kaiser achieves military success through an infernal pact with Satan. Once this is established, the film concentrates on the seemingly endless tally of misdeeds perpetrated by the Kaiser during his quarter-century reign over Germany. His "partner in crime" is the Crown Prince (Earl Schenck), who thinks nothing of casually raping convent girls and gunning down protesting nuns. The Crown Prince's latest conquest is Ruth Monroe (Betty Howe), the daughter of an American inventor. When Ruth's father protests this outrage, he is brutally murdered, whereupon Ruth's sister Alice (Olive Tell) vows revenge. Using her father's newest invention, a wireless machine whose coded messages cannot be intercepted, Alice directs a battalion of planes to bomb the small German village where the Kaiser is hiding. Captured by the Allies, the Kaiser is ignominiously dumped in a POW camp, but not before enduring a well-aimed sock on the jaw from a pugnacious doughboy. In despair, the Kaiser commits suicide and sends his soul to hell. In hell, the devil (Walter P. Lewis) gives up his throne, confessing that the Kaiser is far more sinister than he could ever hope to be.

Fortezza Medicea (Volterra)

The Medici Fortress of Volterra is built on the highest point of the hill overlooking the town. From the outside it is an imposing structure. It takes the form of two smaller fortressess joined together.
Despite its name, the origins of the fortress predate the ascendancy of the Medicis. The southern part was constructed at the command of the Duke of Athens who had been appointed governor of Florence in 1342.
For more than a century the once friendly relationship between Volterra and Florence became increasingly complicated and at times confrontational: the discovery locally of valuable Alum in the 1470s focused the interest of Florence, and in 1472 7,000 Florentine troops besieged and then sacked the town, after which Florentine control over Volterra and the alum mines was no longer in doubt. The fortress was upgraded by another Florentine ruler, Lorenzo the magnificent who was also responsible for the construction of the adjacent newer fortress in 1475.
The two fortresses are linked by a stone “curtain wall”. The fortress is used currently as a maximum security prison and tourist visits to the interior are restricted to a few days and a small portion of the buildings. A notable exception is that part used as a restaurant operated by appropriately supervised prisoners.

New Industries Building

The New Industries Building is a building on the western end of Alcatraz Island off the coast of San Francisco, USA. It was constructed in 1939 for $186,000 as part of a $1.1 million modernization scheme which also included the water tower, power house, officers quarters and remodeling of the D-block.
The ground floor of the two-story 306 ft long building contained a clothing factory, dry cleaning plant, furniture plant, brush factory, and an office, where prisoners of the federal penitentiary could work for money. They made items such as gloves, furniture mats, and army uniforms. The laundry room occupied the entire upper floor, the largest in San Francisco at the time. Each window has 9 panes and there are 17 bays on each floor on either side.
In recent years the building has been updated to address the erosion of the concrete and rust had caused, strengthen the walls and floors, repairing the roof and adding weatherproofed windows and door openings. The Guard Tower on the top of the building was also renovated and remounted.
Legends.
Psychic Daena Smoller and psychologist Larry Montz investigated the prison and found nothing in D-Block or the cellhouse but equipped with a magnetometer, they picked up a reading in the New Industries Building in the area where inmates had been employed in sewing. Smoller says that she picked up on the intense sound of buzzing of sewing machines and energy of the workplace and suddenly felt an intense pain in her neck. Nothing happened for several minutes until the magnetometer reportedly "jumped". Montz said that unless there was an electromagnetic device in the building which would cause it to have taken place, then there was "definitely paranormal activity taking place". Apparently unknown to the investigators, the incident had occurred in the area that Henri Young had murdered Rufus McCain, stabbing him in neck.

William T.B. Sanford

William T.B. Sanford (died 1863) was a road builder, a landowner and the second postmaster of Los Angeles, California, after it became a part of the United States. He was a member of the Los Angeles Common Council in 1853–54.
Personal.
Family.
His siblings were John Sanford, murdered in 1861 by bandit Charles Wilkins (who was later lynched), and Rebecca Sanford,who married California pioneer Phineas Banning.
Between 1850 and 1855, Wilson was the owner of the oldest frame building in Los Angeles — a home that was built for Benjamin Davis Wilson on the East Coast, taken apart, shipped around Cape Horn and reassembled "on the southern corner of Macy and Alameda streets." The house was later given to the Sisters of Charity and was torn down in 1896.
Death.
Sanford died in the 1863 explosion of the steamer "Ada Hancock" in San Pedro harbor. His wife (a daughter of Benjamin Davis Wilson) was injured.
Occupations.
Public service.
Sanford was the second postmaster of Los Angeles after it became a part of the United States.
He was a member of the Los Angeles Common Council in 1853–54. It was he who successfully suggested to the council that "the two printers" in the city be sent an invitation to send a reporter each to their council meetings "for the purpose of bringing any matter of general interest to the public through their newspapers."
Sanford was elected to the Los Angeles school board in 1854 — along with Manuel Requena and Francis Mellus — as part of an energetic drive to erect the first public school in the city, which at that time had "fully five hundred children of school age." In 1854–55 a two-story brick schoolhouse, known as School No. 1, was built at a cost of $6,000 on the northwest corner of Spring and Second streets.
Accountancy.
At one point, he was an accountant for Wells Fargo & Co.
Road builder.
As a road builder, in 1850 Sanford cut a new wagon trail over the Cajon Pass in San Bernardino County, which was preferable to "the rocky stream bed of the East Cajon. The down slope at the top of the new route was still very steep, and they had to lower wagons down the descent. For a distance of 50 feet or so the cattle and all slid down." Known as the Sanford Crossing, Sanford Cutoff or Sanford Pass Route, the road over Baldy Mesa Ridge and West Cajon Fork was used "until completion of the John Brown toll road in 1861.
West of today's Interstate I-15 is the wagon road originally known as the San Bernardino to Salt Lake Road of 1855–1856 (the Sanford Pass Route). This alternate route led from the Mormon Rocks area up and over Cajon Pass to rejoin the main road near Victorville. It was considered the easiest wagon route down into the San Bernardino Valley.
Along this alignment, Sanford took part in a venture with Phineas Banning and David W. Alexander that opened up a trade route between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City along the Santa Fe Trail. The first shipment, in 1855, was a "heavily-laden freighted train of fifteen wagons drawn by one hundred and fifty mules."
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in 1854 gave Sanford and George Carson a contract to build a new wagon road through the Tejon Pass, which road was improved later, in 1858 and 1863, eventually to include a narrow passageway known as the Newhall Cut or Beale's Cut.
Land ownership.
In 1854, Sanford, along with Phineas Banning, John G. Downey and Benjamin D. Wilson, purchased acreage from Rancho San Pedro that became the town of Wilmington four years later.
With Wilson W. Jones, Sanford was part owner of Rancho San Jose de Buenos Ayres, which encompassed what today is the Westside area of Los Angeles County; in 1858 Benjamin D. Wilson bought out Sanford's interest.

Bernardino de Ceballos

Bernadino de Ceballos (or Zavallos, Cevallos, Caballos etc.) was Governor of New Mexico between 1614 and 1618 at a time when it was a province of New Spain.
Background.
The governor preceding Ceballos, Pedro de Peralta, had been arrested on 12 August 1613 by Fray Isidro Ordóñez, the fiery Franciscan monk who headed the church in New Mexico.
Peralta was chained and imprisoned in the mission of Neustra Senora de los Dolores (Our Lady of Sorrows) at Sandia. 
His jailer was Fray Esteban de Perea, who disapproved but obeyed.
Ordóñez assumed full civil as well as religious power in New Mexico until Ceballos arrived.
Peralta was not allowed to leave until November 1614, after Ordóñez and the new governor had taken most of his possessions.
Governor of New Mexico.
Don Bernardino de Ceballos was Admiral at Acapulco, and kept this title when he was appointed Governor of New Mexico on 5 August 1613 by the Viceroy of New Spain, Diego Fernández de Córdoba, Marquis of Guadalcázar.
He traveled to New Mexico with the supply train in the spring of 1814.
The caravan included one covered wagon with eleven mules and was escorted by fifteen soldiers.
Ceballos arrived in Santa Fe in May 1614.
At first he tried to maintain friendly relations with the church, but within a year there were serious disputes with Ordóñez over the use and treatment of the Pueblo Indians.
At one point Ceballos was excommunicated and forced to do public penance.
Ordóñez finally left with the returning supply train in the spring of 1617. 
Ceballos's term ended on 21 December 1618 when his successor Juan de Eulate arrived.
The disputes between the friars and the secular administration later became so violent that in 1620 the King himself had to intervene, taking the side of his governors.

Bavarian EP 1

The electric passenger train locomotives of Bavarian Class EP 3/5 were the first electric locomotives designed for single-phase AC, 15 kV, 16 2/3 Hz working for the Royal Bavarian State Railways. The first electrical services in Bavaria were on the Murnau–Oberammergau line using 5 kV and 16 Hz in 1 January 1905. After 1918 they were reclassified as EP1 20 001 – 005 and taken over by the DR as E 62 01 – 05.
History.
On 1 July 1912 operations began on the line from Garmisch to Scharnitz and,on 28 October 1912, electric services started. From 28 May 1913 electric trains also started running on the Garmisch and Reutte in Tirol railway. For this purpose five locomotives of Class EP 3/5 20 001 – 005 were purchased by the Bavarian state railway and placed in service in 1913. They mainly worked the section from Garmisch to Reutte. For the opening of electric services on the line from Bad Reichenhall to Berchtesgaden one engine (EP 3/5 20 001) was loaned to Freilassing. The engines proved themselves well in service and were stationed at the Garmisch locomotive depot; some were still in service until 1955.
Three engines remained in service with the Deutsche Bundesbahn after the Second World War; the others had been retired in 1939 and 1941. The last one to be paid off was no. E 62 001 in 1955. It was stored until 1965 in the Freimann repair shop and later dismantled.
The drive unit of no. E 62 001 has been preserved in the Nuremberg Transport Museum. During the fire in the Nuremberg-Gostenhof roundhouse in 2005 it was badly damaged.
Technology.
A slow-running, large series-wound motor with 28 poles and two commutators drove the wheels, without any gear reduction, via an unsprung jackshaft. The jackshaft was linked by a coupling rod to three driving axles housed in the locomotive frame.
The axle base of the driving axles was 2000 mm. The jackshaft was located between the first and second driving axles. The first and third driving axles were fixed to the frame, the centre one had transverse play to facilitate curve running. The mass was further distributed to two carrying axles that were designed as Adams axles.
Control was achieved by means of a variable transformer ("Drehtransformator") and power circuit breaker ("Lastschalter") with 11 steps.
The locomotive body had a wedge-shaped driver's cab at each end. The end walls had, as was common for the Bavarian state railways, centre doors and gangways. The side walls had three windows with ventilation slits beneath them. 
Instead of a steam heating boiler for the train heating (as on the Class EP 3/6 20 101–104, EP 3, E 36.1) there was already a connection for electric train heating.

Rye by-election, 1903

The Rye by-election, 1903 was a by-election held in England on 17 March 1903 for the House of Commons constituency of the Rye or Eastern Division of Sussex.
Vacancy.
The by-election was caused by the resignation of the sitting Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Arthur Montagu Brookfield. Brookfield had been MP for Rye since 1885 but he resigned in order to take up the post of HM Consul in Montevideo.
Candidates.
The Conservatives and Unionists selected 54 year old Edward Boyle a barrister, a King’s Counsel, as their candidate. Boyle had unsuccessfully contested Hastings at the 1900 general election and had his country seat at Hurst Green in the then Rye constituency.
The Liberals chose Charles Frederick Hutchinson, a 53 year old medical doctor who had retired to Sussex. Hutchinson had been their candidate against Arthur Brookfield at the 1900 general election.
Campaign.
The opposing candidates adopted classic by-election positions. Boyle defending the Conservative government record, Hutchinson attacking it. One newspaper reported Boyle making his chief appeal ‘on general grounds’. Rye was a largely rural seat and Boyle chose to focus on agricultural issues praising the Agricultural Rates Act of 1896, which had led to the de-rating of farm land, as a step in the right direction and promising to keep up Brookfield’s campaign to press legislative proposals for the defence of the hop industry. On the controversial issue of education, following the 1902 Education Act, Boyle took the view that, while this was not a perfect piece of legislation, it was an honest attempt to deal with a difficult matter. Boyle also took a stand against Irish Home Rule stating he was ‘absolutely against a separate Parliament for Ireland’.
Hutchinson by contrast described the Education Act as a gross injustice to non-conformists and relied on appeals to religion elsewhere in his campaign calling for the maintenance of the Protestant character of the Church of England. In this he was supported by the receipt of a letter from the Reverend R J Campbell, of the City Temple and one the country’s leading non-conformist clergy. The letter urged voters to return Liberal candidates such as Hutchinson to Parliament with a view to a speedy reversal of the current education policy. This focus on religion may have served Hutchinson particularly well at this time as the Weald was said to be one of the few significant pockets of Nonconformity in the rural Home Counties.
As a Liberal, it was not surprising when Hutchinson came out in support of Irish Home Rule.
On foreign policy, Hutchinson declared himself against European complications and alliances. As a Liberal Imperialist he no doubt saw the future in the context of the British Empire. He supported the taxation of land values, licensing reform, the extension of smallholdings and one man one vote. At a conference held at Hastings by the Sussex Women’s Liberal Association, he promised to support a Bill for women's suffrage.
Election incidents.
The election turned nasty at some points. A Conservative procession at Battle was attacked by stone and bottle throwers and torches were wrested from their bearers. It was reported that many people were injured. On the other side however a Liberal meeting at Rye was cut short owing to what was described as an onslaught by young Tories and one of Hutchinson’s meetings at Burwash was similarly infiltrated and disrupted by Boyle’s supporters.
Boyle also suffered a couple of setbacks when his motor cars broke down. It was reported that on Friday 13 March (perhaps inevitably on such a date) that he met with his second motor accident, being left stranded on a country road with the induction coil out of gear.
Result.
The result was a win for Hutchinson and the Liberal Party. 
Rye was a typical mid-term by-election result with public opinion turning against the party in office. It seems that Boyle had been right to try and focus on agricultural issues as one commentator has noted that the import duty on corn (which had been introduced as a Boer War revenue measure in the 1902 budget) was a factor in this and other by-election upsets of the day.
One decisive factor in Hutchinson’s victory may however simply have been better organisation than that of the Unionists. It was reported a week before polling that the Conservative agents seemed complacent and were taking a laissez-faire approach to electioneering. It was noted that they had not held as many meetings as expected and could do with more outside assistance from agents who knew their jobs. It was also reported that the Liberals held 25 meetings across the constituency on the eve of poll, supported by a dozen Members of Parliament. This compared with the Tories holding between 12 and 20 eve of poll events, depending on which reports were most accurate, with about six MPs. If there was any sense of complacency in the Conservative camp this presumably flowed from the fact that Rye had long been one of their stronghold seats. However the Tory election agent at least had sensed the danger as he told supporters that a very determined effort was being made by what he called the Radical party to win the seat and he complained that he had had to deal with a mass of misrepresentation and false statements, accusing the Liberals of even circulating untrue statements about Mr Boyle’s religious views.
What is clear is that the Liberals had never previously made such a sustained effort to capture the seat. Complaints were made that they had brought in a number of professional outside agents, paid by other local Liberal associations or by headquarters in Parliament Street, payments to whom were unlikely to be included in the official election expense returns. The press expected questions to be put to the Attorney General on the legality or otherwise of this practice.
Aftermath.
Hutchinson held the seat until 1906 when the Rye reverted to its more usual Conservative representation. After his defeat by George Courthope, Hutchinson did not stand for Parliament again.
Boyle was elected in 1906 as MP for Taunton, but held the seat for only 3 years, until his death in 1909 at the age of 60.

Scottish Championship Leagues

The Scottish Championship Leagues (referred to as the RBS Championship Leagues for sponsorship reasons) is an amateur league competition for rugby union football clubs in the top divisions of the Scottish rugby system, part of the Scottish League Championship. They are the 3rd tier of Scottish club rugby. 
In 2012 the leagues changed. Two championship leagues of the same number, which are divided into A and B along approximate east/west geographical lines were created. In reality the six national leagues from 2011/12 season (three premier, three national) have become two. The Championship leagues are the first 'step' in the newly created pyramid structure of Scottish club rugby. The next step down are the Regional leagues, East, West and Caledonia. 
One team from Championship A and one team from Championship B will gain promotion at the end of the season, with the bottom two teams dropping down from the National League to take their place. One team from Championship A and B will be relegated at the end of the season to the Regional Leagues. 
History.
The Championship leagues were created for the 2012/13 season, along approximate East/West geographical lines. The first Champions were Glasgow Hutchesons Aloysians RFC from Championship A, and Peebles RFC from Championship B, replacing Hamilton RFC and Jed-Forest RFC respectively in the National League, Livingston RFC, Marr RFC and Aberdeenshire RFC were promoted from the Regional Leagues replacing Dunfermline RFC, Morgan Academy RFC and Perthshire RFC.

<doc id="36884307" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36884307" title="Queen's Debating Union">
Queen's Debating Union

The Queen's Debating Union is the largest and only English speaking debating society at Queen's University in the city of Kingston, Ontario. It was founded as Canada's first debating society in 1843 and became one of the four founding organizations of Canadian inter-varsity University debate. It continues to be an active club on campus and has a strong presence both domestically and internationally as a prestigious and successful competitive parliamentary debating club.
History.
Founded in 1843, the Queen's Debating Union (or QDU) is the oldest student organization at Queen's University and the oldest varsity debating organization in Canada. The Dialectic Society, the original manifestation of the QDU, was responsible for founding in 1858 and initially administering the Alma Mater Society, the student government organization for the University. Later the formerly all-male Dialectic Society incorporated the Levana Debating Society, the club’s all-female equivalent, to become the modern incarnation of the Queen's Debating Union.
Queen's debaters were highly involved in constructing and maintaining the first manifestations of inter-collegiate debate among Canadian institutions, in particular organizing a longstanding set of competitions with the University of Ottawa beginning at the turn of the twentieth century. The club was also responsible for establishing initial links with debating societies in the United States. A 1908 debate between teams from Queen's University and Bates College is believed to have been the first international collegiate debate to have taken place in North America.
Activities.
The Queen's Debating Union is a member of the Canadian University Society for Intercollegiate Debate (CUSID), a national organization which governs and represents university debating across the country. Members of the QDU travel both nationally and globally to participate in competitive varsity tournaments where a broad set of intellectual issues, from bioethics to international political economy, are discussed and debated. Canadian debate tournaments occur in two primary styles of debate. British Parliamentary and Canadian Parliamentary, which involve four and two pairs of debaters respectively, both emphasize a style of debate using a combination of facts and rhetoric to achieve persuasive argumentation.
These tournaments and opportunities give Queen's students the opportunity to increase their knowledge of current issues, foster their public speaking skills and enhance the ability to think on their feet. Members of the Queen's Debate Union have achieved notoriety at public speaking events across Canada. The club is also highly active on campus, organizing show debates, inviting guest speakers, and running a high school outreach program to teach local students about debating and public speaking.
Tournaments.
The Queen's Debating Union routinely hosts national and regional title tournaments as a member of CUSID, including the 2013 Women's National Championships, 2012 Leger Central Canadian Championships, the 2008 British Parliamentary Championship, and the 2004 North American Debating Championships. The QDU also hosts a popular invitational debate tournament each fall, the Queen's Chancellors Cup. 
In the spring, the QDU hosts the annual Queen's University High School Debating Championship, a well-known tournament that attracts hundreds of high school students from across Canada.
Leadership.
Union Executive Council, 2013-2014 Academic Year 
Campus and Community Involvement.
The QDU is a highly active club on the Queen's University campus and the wider Kingston community, participating in monthly show debates and providing semi-weekly meetings that are open to all interested students on campus. 
The Debating Union is responsible for organizing many debate-related events on campus, including a highly publicized twentieth anniversary recreation of the famous 1988 Mulroney-Turner debate, and a public debate about surveillance of urban areas that was hosted with the local Agnes Etherington Art Centre.
The Debating Union also provides adjudicators each year to the highly prestigious Queen's Intercollegiate Business Competition. The club has strong ties with Alumni organizations like the Toronto Over 50 Group and publishes an annual newsletter for Alumni readers called 'The Mace'.
Successes.
The members of the Queen's Debating Union consistently attend dozens of tournaments every year, and have achieved many notable successes. Queen's achieved finalist status at the 2011 Central Canadian Championship, and successfully held the regional title from 2006 to 2008.
In 2003 two debaters from the QDU, Nicola Matthews and Michael Saposnik, were semi-finalists at the World Universities Debating Championship (WUDC), hosted by Hart House (University of Toronto). In 2004, Kevin Massie and Michael Saposnik were semi-finalists at the WUDC hosted by Nanyang University in Singapore. In 2009, Christine Wadsworth and Sheldon McCormick achieved octo-finalist status at the WUDC in Cork, Ireland. In 2010, Christine Wadsworth and Sheldon McCormick again achieved octo-finalist status at the Koc WUDC in Turkey. In 2013, Kaya Ellis and William Gibson achieved octo-finalist status at the Berlin World's Debating Championship.
In 2012, Jake Roth and Kate McNeil won the MacMaster Pro Am Tournament. Robert Embree and Tavish Logan were the champions of the Seagram Invitational. 
The QDU is officially ranked 3rd in Canada and 20th out of all Universities in the world by the International Debate Education Association.
Traditions.
The Queen's Debating Union has developed a number of longstanding traditions that continue to the present-day. The club's motto “Experientia Docet” is both a reference to the value of gaining knowledge and practice, as well as a reference to the ironic observation made by Aldous Huxley in his novel 'Antic Day' that experience doesn't teach in the vast majority of circumstances, humans being resistant to breaking bad patterns. 
The Union has many traditions common to debating societies, such as holiday celebrations and in-house tournaments, as well as traditions unique to the club, including a secret initiation ceremony and the maintenance of a large golden gown. The club is also the only institution in Canada to enforce something called the "Queen's Rule", an injunction that prevents any member or guest from insulting the Monarch of Canada.
A tradition of performing a Gaelic song and dance native to Queen's University called the "Oil Thigh" has been adopted for external tournaments to express solidarity and historical continuity with the club's tradition of excellence. A related activity is the Queen's song, which references past exploits and future resolve, both in the context of academic debate standing as well as social vigour.
The end of every academic year is marked by ceremony known as the 'Closing of the House', which occurs in the historical Hand Purvis Room of Dunning Hall and involves a public debate of graduating members, internal award ceremonies, and a symbolic concluding ceremony.
Notable Former Members.
Ted Hsu, currently the Member of Parliament for Kingston and the Islands
Robert Sutherland, the first known University Graduate of African Descent and the first man of African descent to practice law in Canada.
Cora Taylor Casselman, Liberal member of Parliament for Edmonton East 1941-1945, she was the fourth female representative elected to the Canadian Parliament.

Heterosexuals Organized for a Moral Environment

Heterosexuals Organized for a Moral Environment (HOME) is an American anti-homosexuality organization founded by Wayne Lela and based in Downers Grove, Illinois. The organization's aim is "to use science, logic, and natural law to expose all the flaws in the arguments homosexuals (and bisexuals) use to try to justify homosexual activity". The organization has been designated an anti-gay hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center "based on their propagation of known falsehoods".
Background.
HOME's main goal is to oppose LGBT rights and to criminalize homosexual relations. The group purports that if homosexuality remains legal, then "necrophilia and pedophilia may become legal activities".
According to their web site, the group supports the idea that "penalizing people for engaging in homosexual behavior is clearly not discrimination, just like penalizing people for exhibitionism or incest is not discrimination", adding that "heterosexual activity is not illegalizeable ... while homosexual activity is definitely illegalizeable". HOME believes that gays should apologize "for all the STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) they've spread, and all the money those STDs have cost." HOME also makes a connection between Freemasonry and homosexual sex, positing that Masons may be using their power and influence to spread homosexual values, and linking Masonic rites with homosexual sex.
History.
Heterosexuals Organized for a Moral Environment (HOME) was founded in 1990 by Wayne Lela, a former Catholic and now self-described agnostic.
Activism.
Since 2002, HOME has been allowed set up a booth on the Campus of Elgin Community College (ECC), in Elgin, Illinois once each semester "to provoke thought about the medical and sociological implications of homosexuality".
In 2004, their presence on the campus caused mixed reactions from students and faculty. In response, Carole Akeman, managing director of planning and marketing for ECC, said that it is likely that the college will revisit the decision to allow HOME to continue setting up a booth on the campus, "as the school's primary concern is to provide a safe environment for its students. This is obviously in conflict with our zero-tolerance policy on discrimination."
In 2005, HOME distributed flyers on the Northwestern University campus. Most students accepted the fliers and threw them in a nearby trash can.
In 2006, HOME's founder, Wayne Lela, was relegated to using a remote "free speech zone" at Joliet Junior College. Lela commented that "you could be standing out there with all kinds of fliers and you're not going to see anybody unless they go significantly out of their way."
In 2007, students at the University of Chicago protested against Lela, who was distributing flyers denouncing homosexual behavior.
Hate group designation.
On November 22, 2010, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) designated the Heterosexuals Organized for a Moral Environment (HOME) as an anti-gay hate group "based on their propagation of known falsehoods". According to the SPLC, Heterosexuals Organized for a Moral Environment "is entirely focused on the alleged evils of homosexuality attacks gay people on a wide variety of levels".

Juan de Lienas (fl.ca. 1640), is a composer, probably Mexican, whose compositions - several polyphonic masses and motets in the old style of Guerrero - are found in the Convento del Carmen Codex, of the former Convent school in San Ángel, Mexico City. He is "tentatively identified" with Juan Hernández chapelmaster of Mexico City Cathedral till 1620. If so, then he is unusual for cathedral chapelmasters of the period in being of Mexican Indian origin and married.
One source identifying him as a Cuban composer and chapelmaster at the Cathedral of Havana is to be disregarded.

Verdier started his career at Cannes and made his debut for the club on 20 May 2005, coming on as a second-half substitute for Stéphane Calcé in the 0–1 away defeat at Pau. He scored his first senior goal on 10 February 2006, scoring the third in the 3–1 home win over Nîmes after replacing Madjid Bouabdallah. In total, Verdier played 15 league matches for Cannes before being released in 2008 and subsequently joining Division d'Honneur club Draguignan. In January 2009, he was signed by Boulogne, but failed to make an appearance for the side and left in the summer of that year.
Verdier spent the 2009–10 season with seventh-tier outfit Cagnes-sur-Mer before joining Arles-Avignon ahead of the 2010–11 campaign. He made a number of appearances for the reserve team at Arles but could not break into the first-team squad and was consequently released and signed for Championnat National outfit Gazélec Ajaccio in the summer of 2011. Verdier made his Gazélec debut in the goalless draw with Quevilly on 26 August 2011, playing the first hour before being replaced by Quentin Boesso. He scored his first goal for the club in the 1–0 win over Colmar three games later and became a first-team regular during the 2011–12 season, scoring 14 goals in 33 league matches as the team won promotion to Ligue 2. His 2012-2013 season was disappointing, with only 4 goals in 23 league appearances. He is again playing in Ligue 2 in 2013-2014, having joined newly relegated side Stade Brestois 29.

Saiga Antelope Memorandum of Understanding

The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) Concerning Conservation, Restoration and Sustainable Use of the Saiga Antelope is a Multilateral Environmental Memorandum of Understanding and came into effect on 24 September 2006 under the auspices of the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), also known as the Bonn Convention. The MoU covers five range States (Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Russian Federation, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan), all of which have signed. A number of cooperating organizations have also signed the MoU.
Development of MoU.
To implement the decision of the Seventh Conference of the Parties of CMS to list the Saiga Antelope "(Saiga tatarica)" on Appendix II of the Convention as a consequence of its endangered status and the conviction that conservation efforts of this species are dependent on international collaboration between the range States, an Article IV agreement was concluded and took effect on 24 September 2006 after signature by the third range State. 
Signatories to the Saiga Antelope MoU:
In addition, the following organizations have signed the MoU:
Aim of MoU.
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Saiga populations declined by more than 95% (scientists estimate that only 64,400-69,400 Saigas remain from a former population of nearly 2 million), primarily due to poaching for the species’ meat and horn and Chinese traditional medice. Being one of the fastest population collapses of large mammals recently observed, the MoU aims to reduce current exploitation levels and restore the population status of these nomads of the Central Asian steppes.
Species covered by MoU.
Until 2002 only the sub-species "Saiga tatarica tatarica" was listed on the CMS Appendix II and thus the scope of the MoU was limited to this sub-species. In 2008 however, all "Saiga spp." were listed on Appendix II and at the Second Meeting of Signatories the species coverage of the MoU was extended to the entire species.
Fundamental components.
All Signatories agree to collaborate to improve the conservation status of the Saiga antelope throughout its range, and undertake national and joint activities to conserve restore and sustainably use the species and those habitats and ecosystems important for its long-term survival. Therefore they shall, individually or collectively:
The MoU took effect immediately after at least three of the range States signed it (24 September 2006) and shall remain in effect indefinitely subject to the right of any Signatory to terminate its participation by providing one year’s written notice to all of the other Signatories.
Meetings.
Meeting of Signatories.
Meetings of Signatories are organized regularly to review the conservation status of the Saiga antelope and the implementation of the MoU and Action Plan. National reports by individual Signatories and a report prepared by the Secretariat are also submitted.
The First Meeting of Signatories took place in Almaty, Kazakhstan, 25–26 September 2006. Previous to the meeting a two-day Technical Workshop was organized. During the First Meeting of Signatories the following points were addressed:
The Signatories represented at the meeting were Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. The other two range States, the Russian Federation and Mongolia, were also represented. Additionally, China and the United States were also present. Finally, a number of organizations such as UNDP Kazakhstan, NABU and TRAFFIC attended the meeting.
The Second Meeting of Signatories was convened by CMS and took place in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, 7–10 September 2010, preceded by a technical meeting. The Meeting of Signatories:
The Signatories represented at the meeting were Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation and Mongolia. China as well as a number of organizations such as IUCN, CITES and IFAW also attended the meeting.
Other Saiga meetings.
From 27–29 September 2010 a Workshop on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Saiga Antelope was organized in Urumqi, China. The workshop focused on strengthening international cooperation among consumer and range States and provide a platform for discussion between the Asian traditional medicine industry and those managing conservation activities for the species.
From 17–18 February 2011 a Workshop on the Implementation and Coordination of the Saiga Antelope (Saiga spp.) Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and other CMS Instruments for Migratory Ungulates was held in Astana, Kazakhstan. During this workshop priority activities for Saiga conservation in Kazakhstan were agreed and technical coordination arrangements for 2011 for the MoU with the Association for the Conservation of Biodiversity of Kazakhstan (ACBK) and the Saiga Conservation Alliance (SCA) were confirmed.
Secretariat.
The CMS Secretariat – located in Bonn, Germany – acts as the secretariat to the MoU. One of the main tasks of the secretariat is to prepare an overview report compiled on the basis of information at its disposal pertaining to the Saiga antelope. Furthermore, the secretariat also acts as the Depositary.
Action Plan and Medium Term International Work Programme.
The MoU includes a detailed Action Plan, which was first developed in 2002 at a preparatory meeting in Elista, Russian Federation. It has been drafted in consideration of biological, economic and social research, as well as practical information provided by a range of stakeholders and came into force in 2006. The Action Plan provides a road map to guide the implementation of conservation action for the Saiga antelope in the range States and in those countries which import Saiga products, such as the species’ horn. It has three main objectives:
To reach these objectives activities focus on:
The Medium Term International Work Programme (MTIWP) is the primary road map for conservation actions under the Saiga antelope MoU and is regularly updated. It is this work programme which is used to implement the MoU and to review progress; it reflects the highest priorities for action for a period of five years in order to support the Action Plan’s implementation. The MTIWP for 2007-2011 was adopted at the first Meeting of Signatories in 2006; the MTIWP for 2011-2015 was adopted at the second Meeting of Signatories in 2010.
Altyn Dala Conservation Initiative.
The Altyn Dala Conservation Initiative (ADCI) is a large scale programme to conserve the northern steppe and semi desert ecosystems and their Critically Endangered species like the Saiga antelope. The ADCI is an initiative of the Kazakh Committee of Forestry and Hunting (CFH) of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Environment Protection and is implemented by the Association for the Conservation of Biodiversity of Kazakhstan (ACBK) in partnership with the Frankfurt Zoological Society (FZS) and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). 
The programme started in 2006, uses an ecosystem approach and focuses on an area of about 55 million hectares. The main objectives are: 
One of the biggest achievements to date is the improvement of the population status of the Betpak-Dala Saiga population, which increased more than fourfold since 2006 as a result of joint efforts of the Kazakhstan government, the ADCI and its partners – from estimated 18,600 individuals in 2006 to estimated 78,000 individuals in 2011. 
Despite this good news, the Kazakh Saiga population is still at risk. In 2010 about 15 percent of the Saiga antelope population (around 12,000 individuals) died by an outbreak of pasteurellosis, a disease affecting the lungs, within a 4,500 hectare area of western Kazakhstan.
Cooperation with other organizations.
In 1995 the Saiga antelope was included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) to primarily address the illegal trade in Saiga horn. Since one of the main conservation needs is to reduce and control poaching of the species for their meat and horn, CMS and CITES closely collaborate to address both Saiga population management and illegal trade in order to contribute towards the international conservation of this flagship species of the Eurasian steppes. In the Joint Work Programme between CMS and CITES for the period 2012-2014, the Saiga species are one of the target groups for joint activities. 
To coordinate communication, the newsletter Saiga News was launched in 2005 by the Saiga Conservation Alliance. It is published bi-annually in English and Range State languages and can be accessed through the Saiga Conservation Alliance website.

Career history.
Newson was born in Ipswich in 1992 and was educated at East Bergholt High School. Newson, who was born with growth hormone deficiency, tried out powerlifting for the first time in 2006, joining the Suffolk Spartans club in Colchester in 2007. Newson entered a local competition in 2007, lifting near 40 kg, but by January 2008 she had improved this to 47.5 kg, taking second place at a Paralympic competition in Cardiff. In May Newson lifted a personal best of 60 kg and repeated this feat in June at the British Finals to make her British Champion in her class. 
2009 saw Newson drop weight to take her into the under 40 kg class, and in Cardiff she lifted 70 kg to take first place. She bettered this again that summer with first place at both the World Dwarf Games and the British Finals, lifting 75 kg in both. In November she travelled to Bangalore to compete in the IWAS World Games, taking silver in both the junior and senior events. In 2010 she took first place again in Cardiff, now lifting 80 kg. Her progress continued throughout the year, lifting 85 kg, now double her own weight, at the British Finals and breaking the junior European record. In July Newson was invited to attend the IPC Powerlifting World Championships in Kuala Lumpur, finishing 1st in the junior event and 4th in the seniors. She finished the year by qualifying for the England team for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, her lift of 85 kg placing her just outside the medals in fourth place.
In 2011 she took first in Cardiff, the British Finals and the IWAS World Junior Games. She then took a break from competing to train in preparation for qualifying for the 2012 Summer Paralympics. With a personal best of 88 kg at Cardiff, Newson only entered the events that would ensure her position in the Great Britain team was secure. In February she qualified for the team taking the only position in the women's under 40 kg category. On 30 August, despite having her second lift chalked off, she equalled her personal best lifting 88 kg to take the bronze medal.

Deaths of Asher and Yonatan Palmer

The deaths of Asher and Yonatan Palmer occurred on 23 September 2011, when two Palestinians threw stones at a vehicle containing Asher, aged 24, and his infant son, Yonatan, causing Asher to lose control of the vehicle near the Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba in the West Bank. The car subsequently overturned, and killed both Asher and Yonatan. Initially thought to be an accident, Israel Police later concluded that the deaths were the result of a terrorist attack.
Two Palestinians were arrested and admitted to perpetrating the attack. A third Palestinian who witnessed the attack and stole possessions from Asher's body was convicted of theft.
During that month of September, the IDF recorded 498 incidents of rocks being thrown.
Biography.
Asher and Yonatan Palmer were from the Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba in the West Bank. Asher Palmer's parents are American immigrants to Israel, and he held US citizenship through them. He did his national service in the Israel Defense Forces as part of the hesder program, combining military service with religious studies, doing his service in the Israeli Navy, and was discharged several months before his death. At the time of his death, he was studying at the Jerusalem College of Engineering. After his death, the college started a scholarship fund named after him and his son dedicated to helping religious students support their families while studying. His infant son, Yonatan, who was killed with him, was two days short of his first birthday.
Asher Palmer's wife, Puah, is a nurse at Shaare Zedek Medical Center, and was pregnant at the time of his death. She gave birth to a girl five months after the attack.
The attack.
Asher and Yonatan Palmer were travelling by car along Highway 60 near Kiryat Arba to join Palmer’s pregnant wife in Jerusalem. Two Palestinians hurled stones from their car which caused the death of Asher Palmer and his son after their car overturned. Asher Palmer's face was crushed in the lip region and he sustained fractures to his skull.
After the attack, another Palestinian, Shehada Awad Shehada Shatat, was driving on Highway 60 and observed the attack and car crash. He did not call for medical aid or attempt to help Asher and Yonatan and instead stole Asher's hand gun from his body. The family of Asher and Yonatan Palmer stated that Asher's wallet was also stolen.
Police investigation.
The Police initially stated that the death of Asher Palmer and infant were accidental and a result of driver error. However they later concluded that the deaths were caused by rocks thrown at their vehicle and classified the incident as a terror attack. The Defense Ministry stated that the dead would be recognized as terror victims.
The attack was investigated by a Hebron District police force that dealt with incidents of rocks being hurled at Israeli vehicles from moving cars, this being the 18th case of such attacks. Investigators found a hole in the car's windshield consistent with a rock's entry point. Three rocks were found in the car, and one of them blood-stained, analysis determining that it was human blood. The fractures to Palmer's skull and facial injuries were also assessed and an autopsy on Asher Palmer’s body revealed injuries consistent with rock projectile.
The police were criticized for their initial report of the attack. Settlement leaders said that the police had denied that this was a terror attack to maintain the public order. Minister of the Knesset, Michael Ben Ari, said that the police were fearful of violent protests and the brother-in-law of Asher, Aharon Peretz suggested that the police did not describe this as a terror attack so as not to "fan the flames" and said of Asher, "He never fought with anyone. He was a quiet and special man and this is a great loss."
The mayor of Kiryat Arba, Malachi Levinger, called on the security forces to stop the stone-throwing which endangered lives. He said, "There are tens of thousands of Jews driving to Hebron to pray these days, and their safety must be protected," Danny Dayan demanded the publication of the report saying the public, the media or the bereaved family had not been informed of the true events and that the murder had been covered up.
Funeral.
Many people assembled in a parking lot in Kiryat Arba pay their respects to the deceased. After the eulogies finished, the bodies of Asher and Yonatan, wrapped in a tiny prayer shawl, were carried by mourners to a vehicle in which they were transported to Hebron for burial.
Arrest and trial.
Two Palestinian men from Halhul, Wa'al al-Arjeh and Ali Saadeh, were arrested for the murders of Asher and Yonatan Palmer following an investigation by the Israel Police, Shin Bet, and the IDF. They admitted to hurling the rock which caused the deaths. The rock was thrown at the victims' car from a vehicle speeding in the opposite direction, thereby significantly increasing the force of impact. After police examined the possibility that the two were responsible for 17 other cases involving stones being hurled at Israeli vehicles and the prosecution, the prosecution indicted the men for other stone-throwing attacks, one of them who was charged with attempted murder in another case, in which he allegedly threw rocks at a bus to kill passengers. Three other Palestinian men were indicted in connection to the Palmers’ deaths who allegedly formed cell to target Israeli civilians.
Monitors from the US State Department attended pre-trial hearings of the suspects at the Ofer Military Court, and epresentatives from the US Department of Justice and State Department attended the trial, due to the victims having American citizenship.
Asher Palmer's brother Moshe Palmer said, "I have never felt the need for revenge but I'm glad they were arrested," he added. "Why they did what they did – is no great secret. It doesn't make the pain any easier, but it's good that a relatively short time after the incident, they managed to apprehend the people. I believe that those responsible for catching these people have done their job properly."
On 24 April 2013, Arjeh was sentenced to two life terms and an additional 58 years.
Trial of Shehada Awad Shehada Shatat.
Shehada Awad Shehada Shatat was convicted of stealing Palmer’s gun moments immediately after his death and received a 10- month prison sentence and a NIS 1,000 fine. The prosecution appealed against the leniency of the sentence. Asher's father Michael said that military court had ignored the rights of the victims as he had not been informed of the sentencing hearing and consequently did not provide a victim impact statement for the court to assess. He said, "Shatat saw the attack, saw Asher and Yonatan die, maintained chilling presence of mind as he looked into the just-dead faces of a father and his infant son and then proceeded to desecrate Asher’s still warm body to find and steal the weapon. Shatat may very well have literally had Asher’s blood on his hands." The Court of Appeals later considered the victim impact statements and increased the sentence to 15 months imprisonment.
Memorial services.
In September 2012, a year after the Palmer deaths, a memorial ceremony was held near Jerusalem, attended by U.S. and Canadian diplomats, to add the names of Asher and Yonatan Palmer to a wall commemorating the 300 Americans and Canadians that have been killed in terrorist attacks and Israel's battles. A vineyard was dedicated to Asher and Yonatan on the anniversary of their death and a children's playground in being built in his memory.
Impact.
The Palmer incident had been used as an example during definition of security offenses in the policy change of integration laws.
The Palmer incident was used as the base for building a defense wall in nearby roads.
The IDF stated said polices and rules had been changed as a result of the event.

Building 64

Building 64, also known as the 64 building, building # 64 or the Building 64 Residential Apartments, was the first building constructed on the island of Alcatraz off the coast of San Francisco, USA, entirely for the purpose of accommodating for the military officers and their families living on the island. Located next to the dock on the southeastern side of the island, below the Warden's House the three-story apartment block was built in 1905 on the site of a U.S. Army barracks which had been there from the 1860s. It functioned as the Military Guard Barracks from 1906 until 1933. One of its largest apartments in the southwest corner was known as the "Cow Palace" and a nearby alleyway was known as "Chinatown". 
During Federal prison times from 1934, the building gradually fell into a shabby state, and new quarters were built on the Parade Grounds, but most families arriving on the island stayed in building 64 until a room in the newer quarters was available. Most of those residential quarters which were built have since been demolished, but the 64 building remains and has since been renovated. During the Occupation of Alcatraz, in 1970 the Native Americans drew graffiti in red around the "United States Penitentiary" sign saying "Indians welcome" and "Indian land". There is a book store on the ground floor on the left side of the building.

Charles Noke

Charles John Noke (1858 Worcester - 1941), was an English pottery designer and artist who primarily worked for Royal Doulton.
He is noted for producing many different ranges of pottery using differing techniques and was also hugely influential in helping Doulton establish itself as a world leader. After he joined Doulton in 1889 he became the Art Director and was able to affect all aspects of production at the Burslem site and in doing so instigated a revolution in both design and production turning Doulton into the leading art manufacturer of the age.
Noke's greatest achievement was the creation of a range of experimental transmutation glazed wares that are at best as good as anything produced at Sèvres, Copenhagen, Dresden or even in the Far East. These ranges, the Flambes, Titanian, Sung, Chinese Jade, Chang and Crystalline represent one of the greatest contributions to studio pottery made by a large British manufacturer in this century. 
He is also well known for launching the HN figurines (named after Harry Nixon who was in charge of the figure painting department). This naming convention for figurines still endures today. 
Noke contributed significantly to the character studies and some of his designs, The Jester, The Potter and The Cobbler are among the most recognisable and enduring characters produced by Doulton. He was also known for his designs of other colourful 'Eastern' characters.
Noke joined Royal Worcester as an apprentice modeler in 1873, aged 16, whilst also attending the Worcester School of Design. Noke's work at Worcester caught the eye of Doulton's Art Director John Slater (whom Noke would later succeed) and after 16 years at Royal Worcester (1889) Noke joined Royal Doulton as Chief Designer working from the Nile Street site in Burslem.
Noke's early career at Doulton was spent modelling and decorating pieces to be displayed at exhibitions around the world, most notably the Chicago World Fair in 1893. It was Noke's ambition to rival the other major pottery manufacturers of the day and Doulton mounted an extensive display of large, ornate and highly decorated vases and plates. Noke is credited with reviving the fortunes of Figurines in the Potteries and in particular at Doulton where he was able to persuade Henry Doulton that he could design figures that would sell.
In the early 1890s Noke began to experiment with figure models, the first of these being shown at the Chicago Fair. 
From 1909 Noke and fellow designers started to work on the design and production of what was to become the HN Series of figurines. These were first launched in 1913 with Bedtime (HN1), this was later changed to Darling after a comment, "Isn't he a little Darling?", from Queen Mary whose patronage helped to establish the series. It was from these beginnings that the vast range of Doulton figures can be found today. 
Noke is credited with some of Doultons most famous creations: Flambe Ware, Kings Ware, Series Ware and Character Jugs.
Doulton's Flambe Ware is very striking with its fiery red colour and there were a variety of different pieces produced with this finish. Doulton's first flambe finished products were exhibited at the St. Louis Exhibition in 1904.
The Kings Ware glaze effect developed by Noke had a rich brown finish to it. It was used to produce many advertising items and was made by Doulton from 1901 to 1939.
The concept of Series Ware was to decorate a range of different ceramic items, e.g. plates, vases etc. with the same theme/ pattern thus making them belong together as part of a series. Noke popularised this with his series of Dickens characters.
Character Jugs varied from the traditional Toby Jugs in that they only featured the head and shoulders of a character. They were also more brightly coloured than the traditional Toby Jug. Doulton first introduced these character jugs in 1934 with Noke's own John Barleycorn.
Noke was Art Director at Doulton from 1914 until he retired from the position in 1936, aged 78. Noke continued to work at Doulton until his death in 1941.

Lopota incident

In Lopota incident, known in Georgia as the special operation against an illegal armed group in Lopota (Georgian: შეიარაღებული დაჯგუფების დევნის ოპერაცია ლაფანყურში), Georgian special forces engaged an unidentified paramilitary group of about 17 persons which had allegedly taken several people hostage in a remote Caucasus gorge of Lopota near the border between Georgia and the Russia's Republic of Dagestan. At first the gunmen were widely believed to be Russian Islamist insurgents from Dagestan.
During the operation, that began on August 28, 2012, at least 14 people were killed and at least six wounded in a firefight on August 29. Among the victims were 11 members of the mysterious armed group (including at least two Georgian citizens as well as at least five Russian citizens, all of the latter born in the former Chechen–Ingush ASSR). Georgian special service personnel lost three men killed and five injured. On September 8, an injured suspected militant, Akhmed Chatayev, a Russian citizen of Chechen ethnicity holding a refugee status in Austria, was arrested. Chatayev was put on trial for illegal weapon possession but protests his innocence, saying he was actually a negotiator for the government and that he was carrying no arms; he was later acquitted. The operation was officially concluded on October 30.
Many details of the clash, the most deadly in Georgia since the 2008 South Ossetia war, still remain unclear. The governments of Georgia and Russia, as well as Russia's Islamic insurgents of the Caucasus Emirate that abortively claimed that the shadowy armed group belonged to their main forces in Dagestan, accused each other of a provocation. The incident was also lambasted by Georgian then-opposition (winner of the October 2012 election) coalition Georgian Dream, who accused Saakashvili's United National Movement government of lying about it and promised that those responsible for the deaths would be punished.
Background.
The incident saw the worst loss of life in Georgia since the brief territorial war with Russia, in which hundreds of people were killed during five days in 2008. Tensions between the two countries have remained strong since the ceasefire, with the Russian military continuing to occupy Georgia's breakaway territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and the two countries having not resumed diplomatic relations.
The deadly clash in Georgia took place against the backdrop of the continued Islamic insurgency in Russia's North Caucasus region, including the Republic of Dagestan, where the situation was reported to be worsening for Russia. In the months preceding the incident, the mounting violence in Dagestan has reached the point of practically daily reports of attacks and armed clashes, with scores of fatalities each month. On the very day of the skirmish in Georgia (August 29, 2012), a local Dagestani member of the Russian Border Guard, apparently recruited by insurgents, shot dead two of his fellow border guards and then killed at least five SOBR special purpose police officers from Russia's Altai Republic before being gunned down himself. The day before (August 28), Dagestani rebels attacked a base of Russian Interior Ministry special forces, reportedly seizing its armory building and killing at least two Internal Troops paramilitary soldiers, and an ethnic Russian female suicide bomber killed a prominent Dagestani spiritual leader Sheikh Said Afandi al-Chirkawi and at least six other civilians. According to Caucasian Knot tally, during the week of August 27 – September 2, a total of at least 50 people fell victim to armed conflict in the North Caucasus, not including the events in Georgia.
The Russian government has repeatedly accused Georgia of offering a safe haven to the insurgents and the Western-backed Georgian government has consistently rejected Russian allegations. According to the BBC correspondent Damien McGuinness, "it was crucial for Georgia to act decisively, as there were fears in Tbilisi that Moscow would use any sign that terrorists from the North Caucasus are operating in the region as a pretext for moving in to Georgia." Soso Tsintsadze, head of the Diplomatic Academy of Georgia, said a failure to "respond resolutely" would have exposed Georgia to "even more unpleasant developments". According to the website Vestnik Kavkaza, "such a radical decision and even tragic victims seem to be less evil than another explosion in Georgian-Russian relations in the event of the violation of Dagestani section of the border by an armed group from Georgia." Central Asia-Caucasus Institute analysis by Emil Souleimanov concluded: "As the counterinsurgent activities by federal and local armed forces gain momentum in Dagestan, the current epicenter of Islamist insurgency in the North Caucasus, where dozens of thousands of army and ministry of interior troops have concentrated recently, the pressure will increase on the insurgents to occasionally cross the Russian-Georgian, as well as the Russian-Azerbaijani borders, to secure a temporary safe haven. [... Georgia and Azerbaijan would be prompted to either turn a blind eye on the presence of armed militants on their soil and risk a conflict with Moscow, which might use this as a pretext for exerting pressure on the South Caucasian countries with the ultimate risk of military interference, or risk a dangerous conflict with ethnic minorities of Chechen and Dagestani descent populating their borderline areas."
Georgian special operation.
On August 28, Georgian television reported that five young men from the village of Lapankuri in Telavi District, 20 kilometres from the Dagestani section of the border with Russia, had gone missing for several days. Some news reports cited local residents as saying that a few days earlier they had spotted several unknown men in military uniforms in the vicinity of the village. The missing men were soon reported found and taken by police for questioning. A former hostage said that the gunmen demanded to escort them to the border with Russia, promising to release them after reaching Dagestan and claiming they intended "to just quietly cross the border." A man identified as Levan Khutsurauili, described as one of the freed civilians, later said that he and his friends had been seized on August 26 by an armed group of about 15 bearded men while returning from a picnic near the border and told they would be shot if they tried to escape. According to some reports, the gunmen spoke Georgian.
Late on August 28, Georgian Interior Ministry released a brief statement saying that an armed group was detected and first reports emerged about movement of special forces in pickup and military trucks and helicopters into the area. On the morning of August 29, the ministry announced that its troops blocked the gorge and were pursuing the armed group, and at 1 p.m. declared the operation as "anti-terrorist", claiming that the group had entered Georgia from Dagestan. Deputy Interior Minister Nodar Kharshiladze stressed: "We can’t definitely say who these paramilitary people are and what their purpose is, but it is clear they were conducting some kind of terroristic activities there." Kharshiladze said that the militants had freed their hostages but then opened fire on security forces after being asked to surrender. The deaths of 14 people were announced shortly before 4 p.m. The ministry also said that at least six gunmen were continuing their resistance to Georgian security forces, but no further casualties were reported. On the next day, August 30, Georgian Prime Minister Vano Merabishvili, who has established an anti-crisis headquarters and held a meeting with all power ministers, announced the operations to be "nearly completed," saying it "ensured the security of our citizens and our borders," and that special forces were still searching for possible wounded stragglers from the armed group of around 20.
Speaking on national television late on August 29, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili Saakashvili said that a "well-armed and well-trained armed group appeared on the Chechen and Dagestan section of the Georgian-Russian border" and took Georgian citizens hostage, and that this group was "destroyed" in a shootout after having ignored repeated demands to surrender, adding that military unmanned aerial vehicles have been deployed at the scene. Late on August 29, National Security Council of Georgia Chairman Giga Bokeria said that it is plausible that the group had links with anti-Moscow groups in Dagestan and "obvious" that their presence in Georgia was connected with "developments there", presumably meaning the reported buildup of the Russian Ground Forces in the western districts of Dagestan bordering on Georgia (earlier that year, about 20,000 Russian Army soldiers have been transferred from Chechnya to Dagestan).
A more detailed Georgian government account was released later on August 30. According to it, the crisis had began on August 28, when the armed group captured a patrol of the Border Police of Georgia who have been searching for the five missing local residents. The gunmen agreed to an offer by a senior border guard officer to keep just him as a hostage and to let go the civilians and the other border guards. Later, an official from the Georgian Interior Ministry arrived to negotiate and demanded their surrender, which was rejected. The group then decided to swap the last captive border guard for the official, telling him that he is now their hostage. Two of the gunmen then accompanied the official to a location where he could talk with his superiors to update them about the new developments, but instead they were led to an ambush site, where one of them was shot dead by a government sniper. The shooting sparked a firefight, in which 10 more members of the armed group and three Georgian troops were killed. Georgian forces used helicopters and aerial drones.
The killed Georgian troops were announced as being two officers of the Interior Ministry's special purpose police unit, Major Archil Chokheli (who was also the sambo coach of the national team of Georgia and former Europe and world champion in sambo, as well as former champion in kurash) and Captain Solomon Tsiklauri, and a Georgian Land Forces Corporal Vladimer Khvedelidze who served as a medic with the Defence Ministry's special operations forces. On August 30, Georgian police released video footage showing dead bodies of several men in camouflage uniforms with their faces censored, and weapons recovered from the site of the clash, including a variety of automatic weapons, several anti-tank grenade launchers and at least two sniper rifles (one of them silenced), as well as communication and night vision equipment, Russian passports and copies of the Quran.
On August 31, Georgian Interior Ministry reported on continuation of special operation in Lopota Gorge. On September 5, additional vehicles and helicopters with military and police special forces were sent into the area to reinforce the continued search for the estimated six remaining militants. On September 8, Interior Ministry announced it had captured one wounded member of an armed group, identifying the suspected militant as "a citizen of the Russian Federation from North Caucasus," Akhmet Chataev (Akhmed Chatayev), adding he was rendered the medical assistance and his life is not in a danger. According to the government announcement, Chatayev surrendered to a patrol of border guard to whom he handed over two live F-1 grenades. The operation officially ended on October 30 with a burial of four alleged militants.
Identity and motive of the armed group.
Official statements.
More detailed official information about the incident has been slow to emerge, with interpretations offered by Saakashvili and Bokeria having been at odds. Initially, Georgian government-connected television stations Imedi TV and Rustavi 2 described the armed group as "saboteurs" and the initial Interior Ministry reports indicated involvement of infiltrators from Russia's Republic of North Ossetia–Alania. Later, the group was described as "terrorists" and "armed subversives". Parliamentary Chairman Davit Bakradze declined to comment but said that members of the armed group "are not citizens of Georgia." The Border Guard Service of Russia said that "no cases of crossing the Dagestani stretch of the Russian-Georgian border were recorded" and Russian officials called the reports of fighting in Georgia "a provocation." However, a RIA Novosti source in the Dagestani police said that the group was a part of a Dagestani insurgent group from Tsuntinsky District ("Tsuntinsky gang") and had indeed crossed the border with Georgia.
Vdagestan.com, a website of the Dagestan wing of the North Caucasus insurgency, took responsibility for crossing the border, but denied planning any operations on Georgian territory. They rejected the allegations of having taken civilians hostage, dismissing them as "lies and slander", and blamed the Georgian authorities for the bloodshed. The statement accused the Georgian side of arranging a "trap for the mujahideen of the Caucasus Emirate" by "betraying and killing the brave sons of the Caucasus", adding that "this is by no means the first time they have taken such a treacherous step in a bid to appease the Putinist regime in Russia," and threatened revenge attacks in case special operation was not stopped. The statement also appeared in another Russian Islamist and North Caucasus insurgency-connected website Kavkaz Center (KC), but was soon removed from both websites. KC then presented a different version, according to which "a detachment of recruits, secretly formed by the command of the Mujahideen on the border between Dagestan and Georgia, to move to a destination site on the territory of Dagestan to take part in the fighting against Russian occupation forces" but the Georgian authorities demanded that they surrender, regarding their presence on the Georgian soil as "a provocation, which could be used by Russia as a pretext for a new military invasion of Georgia." Regarding the alleged civilian hostages, KC said that "on the contrary, it is because the recruits released five Georgians, whom they incidentally met en route, the leakage occurred followed by subsequent tragic events."
On September 7, the Chechen language department of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), Radio Marsho, reported that it had been contacted by a Caucasus Emirate representative calling himself Abu Khamza, who stated: "All the necessary information is being gathered now. There should be a thorough investigation into the causes that led to such consequences. Only then we can make an official statement with conclusions and assessments of what happened." Chechen secular separatist leader Akhmed Zakayev said that his Chechen Republic of Ichkeria's government-in-exile has already established "a special committee" to investigate the causes of the incident. Zakayev said that "regardless of whether the Georgian side will cooperate with us or not, we have the appropriate resources to the reveal the truth. Afterwards, the Chechen legitimate government will express its position."
Media theories.
According to RFE/RL, "It is, of course, possible that the Georgian authorities initially assumed that the incursion was masterminded by Moscow, and realized only after verbal contact was established with the intruders that it was not. Alternatively, they may have inferred at an early stage that the men were insurgents from Daghestan but killed them all the same, in order to perpetuate the uncertainty over their true identity and why they crossed the border and thus, by extension, the suspicion that Russia may have been behind the incident." Caucasus expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Mamuka Areshidze, said it was "odd" that the special forces apparently did not try to take the gunmen alive for interrogation, as they could have shot to incapacitate rather than to kill. Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer said he has an "impression that this clash was accidental from both sides. I do not have any reasons yet to connect what happened with the conspiracy theories. [...] What happened in Lapankuri looks more like a serious misunderstanding."
According to the Russian paper "Kommersant", another alternative version "actively discussed among the Chechens living in Georgia" is that the gunmen belonged to a Chechen armed group heading for a meeting of field commanders with the Caucasus Emirate leader Doku Umarov in Dagestan and had entered Georgia's territory through the Chechen section of the Russian-Georgian border, but got lost along the way near Dagestan and so attempted to take the locals as guides. According to still another theory presented by Georgia's Russian language television channel PIK TV, the armed group might have come to Georgia to commemorate the son of the famous Chechen field commander Ruslan Gelayev (Gelayev was killed in a shootout with Russian border guards in 2004 in Dagestan's Tsuntinsky District while trying to enter Georgia), Rustan. Rustam was killed during the Battle of Aleppo in Syria in August 2012 and reportedly buried in Georgia's Pankisi Gorge, located several dozen kilometers from Lopota. Pankisi is an area populated by Kists, the ethnic Chechens of Georgia.
Identities.
The person detained as an alleged militant turned out to be Akhmed Chataev (Chatayev), a one-handed ethnic Chechen refugee and Russian citizen who has received refugee status in Austria and who had lived in Pankisi for more than two years. On September 6, Information Center of Kakheti announced that Chatayev, described as Umarov’s personal representative in Europe (according to other sources, Chatayev was rather a former special envoy of the late Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov), who had briefly disappeared after the special operation in Lopota Gorge. Chatayev insisted that he had been brought by two Georgian Interior Ministry's counter-terrorist department officials, Sandro Amiridze and Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, as a negotiator to talk with a group of 17 Chechen and Kist militants that intended to travel to Chechnya via Dagestan. According to Chatayev, he was unarmed and was wounded when an unknown shooter suddenly shot him in his left leg as he was waiting for a reply from the authorities after relaying by phone the group's refusal to disarm. After that, he hid and barely survived for 10 days without any food nor water before surrendering to the Border Police, but his wound got seriously infected and a part of his foot was later amputated in the Gori Military Hospital, where he spent the next 10 days.
By September 3, seven of the 11 killed members of the armed group were announced as identified by the Georgian Interior Ministry. Among them were two Georgian citizens, Bahaudin Kavtarashvili (born in 1986) and Aslan Margoshvili (born in 1990). Another, Bahaudin Baghakashvili (born in 1986), was born in Grozny but had relatives in Georgia's Pankisi Gorge. According to unofficial reports, the total of six of those killed were natives of Pankisi. Five others, including Baghakashvili, were Russian citizens from the North Caucasus, specifically the former Chechen–Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic: Musa Aduyev (born in 1981), Dukvakha Doshuyev (born in 1968) and Salam Zaurbekov (born in 1991) from the Republic of Chechnya, and Jabrail Khashiev (born in 1989) from the Republic of Ingushetia. The most prominent among the killed alleged militants was Doshuyev, veteran of the First Chechen War of 1994–1996 and a former bodyguard of Zakayev. Doshuyev had been detained and then given amnesty by Russian federal forces in early 2000. Notably, Moscow unsuccessfully tried to use him as a witness in their 2003 attempt to have Zakayev extradited from his self-exile in London. Zakayev commented: "I know that Dukvakha Dushuev, having political asylum in Great Britain, was not in Russia and lived in the Pankisi Gorge, Georgia for the last six months. It is unclear how he joined this group."
Nanuashvili's allegations.
On April 1, 2013, Public Defender of Georgia Ucha Nanuashvili called on the Parliament of Georgia to set up an investigative commission to look into armed clash and events leading up to that incident, saying that his own probe revealed circumstances contradicting official version of events that was offered by the previous government. In an 800-page report, Nanuashvili alleged that the Interior Ministry's counter-terrorist department itself had recruited 120 local Kists, Chechens (including veterans living abroad) and other North Caucasian refugees. The recruits would be then armed and trained by Georgian personnel and Chechen veterans at the Vaziani Military Base and at Shavnabada in early 2012. In August, a group of 16 Vainakhs decided to cross the Russian border on their own initiative, but were refused a passage and intercepted by Georgian Interior Ministry special forces deployed there by helicopter. After the negotiations through prominent Chechen mediators did not bring a breakthrough in the standoff, as the militants responded to the demands they would disarm by insisting they would surrender their weapons only after they reached Pankisi, seven (not 11) of them and three Georgians (including two handlers of the gunmen) were killed, and the rest of them were then escorted to Turkey. The parliament declined Nanuashvili's proposal on the grounds that an investigation by prosecutor's office is under way.
Merabishvili, who was the Interior Minister in early 2012, dismissed the story as "idiotic" and in line with Russia’s anti-Georgian propaganda. Former Deputy Interior Minister Gia Lortkipanidze, alleged to be in charge of the armed group, called it "absurd" and "slander". A prominent member of the Chechen community in Georgia, Umar Idigov, had previously alleged it was former Defense Minister Bacho Akhalaia who was the mastermind behind a supposed idea to create a force of Chechen fighters and infiltrate them into Russia. Akhalaia, who had also held the posts of chief of the prison system and Interior Minister, had already put on trial on multiple charges of exceeding power and abuse of soldiers and prisoners. However, his brother Data (Dato), himself a former Interior Ministry official who has been put on Interpol's wanted list on torture charges, claimed to be in possession of evidence that it was Merabishvili who had plotted the "adventure" in Lopota gorge as a provocation to discredit Akhalaia brothers as a part of a power struggle within the ministry. Tbilisi Mayor Gigi Ugulava dismissed Data Akhalaia's allegations due to their "absurdity" and hinted that Bacho Akhalaia's associates were targeting UNM party activists upon instructions from the new government.
Reactions.
Georgian government and opposition.
On August 30, President Saakashvili visited Lapankuri, the village closest to the site of the events. Saakashvili called the incident an attempt to "stage a provocation", adding that incidents of this kind "directly or indirectly usually serve as a pretext for our country’s invader," meaning Russia. Referring to North Caucasus peoples as "brothers," Saakashvili said: "We salute tourists but won’t let raids of armed persons against peaceful population on Georgian territory." He added that "disorder and instability behind these mountains will stay there. We will do everything for this." Saakashvili also made a reference to the memory of lekianoba, the 17th–18th century raids in which bands of Lezgi highlanders from Dagestan ravaged the Kakhetian countryside of Georgia. On August 30, Georgia deployed sappers into the Laputa Gorge, who, according to unofficial information, would be used to set mine fields at this section of the border with Russia. Nevertheless, Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Nino Kalandadze said that Georgia will continue its open policy to the North Caucasians.
Georgian opposition politicians said that the incident needs to be thorough investigated. Irakli Alasania, one of the leaders of the opposition coalition Georgian Dream–Democratic Georgia, said, that "there is not yet enough information to make a comprehensive analysis of what has happened. One thing is clear: our borders are not protected well and an armed group of 20 persons can cross into the country without being detected by the border guard. A comprehensive investigation needs to be carried out in order to look into who was in charge of negotiations with (the armed group); what was the subject of negotiations and why was this operation planned in such a way that led to death of so many people." The Georgian Dream stated: "Even based on existing scarce and contradictory information, which the authorities disseminate, there is an impression that the authorities have acted in a characteristically impatient manner and launched the special operation in a condition when the possibilities of a negotiated solution were not fully exhausted and in a condition when there was still a minimal chance of avoiding casualties."
Both the Georgian Dream opposition and Georgia's then-ruling party United National Movement have postponed earlier planned mass actions related to the upcoming parliamentary election due to the death of Georgian citizens. At a rally on September 9, Bidzina Ivanishvili, the leader of the Georgian Dream, accused the government of "insolently lying" about the operation and said that "tragedy" of Lopota would be investigated and those responsible punished, adding, "Georgian troops died there; Georgian citizens, Kists died there and North Caucasians died there too. This is not a Georgian dream; this can’t be a Georgian dream." At his own rally on the same day, Saakashvili said about "a very dangerous military provocation in the Lopota Gorge" related to an alleged greater Russian plot to "give them government a pretext to use our internal disorders and internal divide for implementation of their sinister plans" and charged that his opponents who are "weeping today for the fate of terrorists and have not even utter a word about our special forces personnel who died, knew very well what this provocation was about; what this mess was all about." The election was won by the Georgian Dream opposition.
Other reactions.
Georgian officials said Swiss diplomats were used to contact Russia about the border situation. However, Moscow did not respond to Georgia's proposal to cooperate. According to British expert Thomas de Waal, Russia side did not answer because it "does not want to thank the Georgian government." The only response came for Vadim Shibayev, a spokesman for the FSB, which is in charge of Russian border guard, calling the reports of trespassing from Russia "provocative" and groundless.
The NATO-Georgia Commission received information from the head of Georgian representation in NATO, Nugzar Mgaloblishvili. NATO and the European Union expressed concern about the situation and declared the need to "find a solution to the problem on the basis of internationally accepted norms." The United States Embassy to Georgia issued a statement "remembering three brave Georgians" and extending their "deepest sympathies" also "to the many other Georgian servicemen who continue to risk their lives to ensure a more secure Georgia and a more peaceful world."
Representative of the Chechen diaspora in Georgia and advisor to the State Minister for Reintegration Issues, Meka Khangoshvili, made a statement stressing that the incident should not become a cause for tension between Georgians and the North Caucasian nations. Akhmad Umarov, Doku Umarov's elderly brother reportedly living in Tbilisi, stated his opinion that the Georgian side "is not responsible for the death of the Chechen Mujahideen." A Chechen secular separatist website ChechenCenter said that "the only country that benefits" from this incident is Russia, saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin might to try to "divide and conquer" the Caucasus as the world watches the conflict in Syria.
Aftermath.
Burials.
Captain Tsiklauri was posthumously awarded the Vakhtang Gorgasali Order, one of the highest decorations in Georgia, and buried on September 2 in Rusiani in a funeral attended by high officials including President Saakashvili. The funeral of Major Chokheli took place in Galavani on September 4, attended by Saakashvili, Interior Minister Bachana Akhalaia, chief of the National Olympic Committee Gia Natsvlishvili, other officials, and representatives of the opposition. Saakashvili and Akhalaia also attended the funeral of Corporal Khvedelidze, who too was posthumously awarded the Vakhtang Gorgasali Order and buried in Samtredia on the same day; Khvedelidze's family was given a new house from the state in compensation.
Saakashvili said that killed gunmen should be buried "with observance of their Muslim traditions," adding, "we are not Russian troops; we should pay relevant respect to killed" in a reference to the Russian government's official policy of destroying the corpses of alleged terrorists. Deputy Interior Minister Shota Khizanishvili also affirmed that the militants' bodies will be buried in accordance with their faith. On September 3–4, three of the killed militants (Baghakashvili, Kavtarashvili and Margoshvili) were buried by residents of Duisi in the Pankisi Gorge. On September 3, the Georgian Dream opposition issued a statement condemning "the criminally irresponsible information policy of the authorities" and said that "horrifying details are being reported about moral pressure exerted on relatives" of the killed gunmen by the government officials allegedly trying to hide the fact there were Georgian citizens among the members of the armed group. Allegedly, government officials conducted at least one burial at night and family members were forbidden to gather people for a funeral or even to see the body. The killed Chechens were buried also in Duisi village cemetery at night of October 30. Reportedly, family members of one of the killed Chechens arrived in Georgia in September but the government refused to hand over the body to them. In May 2013, the authorities re-examined corpses of Baghakashvili, Margoshvili and Zaurbekov; family members said they agreed for exhumations to be conducted despite Islam forbidding removing the dead from their graves, because they too want to find the truth. The bodies were exhumed in order to determine precisely how they died, as the results of the original postmortems have disappeared.
Chatayev trial.
On October 24, Chatayev was accused of the illegal purchase, possession and carrying of an explosive device, facing between three and five years in prison if convicted. The date of a preliminary court hearing in the case was set on October 29. Chatayev, reported as having a refugee status in Austria, denied the charge and pled his innocence, claiming that had arrived in the Lopota gorge to hold negotiation at a request of senior official of the Interior Ministry of Georgia and that the sniper wounded him in a leg while he was waiting for a reply from the government. According to Information Center of Kakheti, witnesses (three border guards who detained Chatayev) were compelled by the Interior Ministry to sign false testimonies in the case and Chatayev really carried no hand grenades. The hearing on the case, scheduled for November 15, was postponed till November 26 due to the absence of the border guard witnesses. Following Chatayev's arrest, his wife Aina Margoshvili left Georgia, presumably to go to Turkey, but later returned to Georgia and picketed the court hearings along with their son and dozens of Chechens under the slogan "Freedom to Akhmed Chatayev".
On November 13, Georgia refused to extradite Chatayev to Russia after Khangoshvili appealed to international human rights organizations to protect his rights and declaring him "arbitrarily imprisoned". Georgia's new justice minister Tea Tsulukiani said that "Georgia has refused to extradite Chatayev to Russia, and that is a matter of principle for us," because five Chechens, including residents of the Pankisi Gorge, whom Georgia extradited to Russia by the government of Eduard Shevardnadze in 2002 had "disappeared"; Tsulukiani said: "We know nothing about what happened to them, but this tradition must be brought to an end." She also promised that Chatayev would receive a fair and impartial trial in Georgia. On December 6, Tbilisi City Court agreed to free Chatayev on $3,000 bail. On January 18, 2013, the court acquitted Chatayev after the prosecutor has withdrawn all charges against him. Chatayev commented: "I knew that if the witnesses tell the truth, I would be acquitted."
Ivanishvili government investigation.
In November 2012, the new government has reopened the investigation into the incident, conducted by the Interior Ministry is cooperation on with the prosecutor’s office. In April 2013, Ivanishvili, who has become a new Prime Minister, said that the investigation may reveal "shocking" results and substantiate allegations of Nanuashvili. Ivanishvili's statement was strongly criticized as "irresponsible" and "dangerous" by Saakashvili, who declared "with full responsibility" that "Georgia never participated in training any terrorists." Alasania, who has become a new Defense Minister, and Parliament Chairman David Usupashvili, also a member of Georgian Dream, have distanced themselves from Ivanishvili’s remarks.
Chechen government-in-exile investigation.
The Zakayev government's report was presented by Foreign Minister Usman Ferzauli on August 1, 2013. Its findings repeat many of the allegations contained in Nanuashvili's report. According to the report by the State Commission of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, the main organizer of the armed group was Akhmed Umarov, working closely with the special services of the Interior Ministry of Georgia. He had been released from the FSB prison and allowed to leave the country for Georgia, where the Russian side might hoped he would organize a large-scale international provocation and create a "casus belli" for occupation of all of Georgia by Russia. Main insitigators from the Vainakh side were also to include Gabriel (Jabrail) Khashiev, an ethnic Ingush wanted for murdering Chechens in Turkey, as well as Chatayev, described as Dokka Umarov's representative in Turkey and a relative of Dushuev. Most of the 200 recruits had left peacefully before the crisis in Lapota began, returning to their homes (in Georgia, the European Union, Turkey and Egypt) after the group's Georgian handlers refused to allow them to cross into Russia. The report names Georgia's Deputy Interior Minister Givi Lordkipanidze as the direct head of the operation in Lopota, which it says was coordinated by and approved by Saakashvili.

Mayday (Lecrae song)

"Mayday" is a song by Christian hip hop artist Lecrae featuring fellow rapper Big K.R.I.T. and "American Idol" finalist Ashthon Jones. Released on August 30, 2012, it is the fourth single off the album "Gravity", which was released on September 4, 2012. The song's lyrics focus on religion, spirituality, and the role of grandmothers in developing faith and stability. It features a confession by Big K.R.I.T in which he expresses frustration with Christian hypocrisy. The song has been well received by critics and is considered one the best songs off the album, with the lush instrumental production by DJ Khalil and the vocals by Ashthon Jones attracting particular praise. Stylistically, "Mayday" is described as having both a very "raw" and "organic" sound and R&B flow, with "chaotic" and "funky" production.
Lyrics and style.
Lyrically, the song is based around a line where Big K.R.I.T. confesses his lack of church attendance and expresses frustration with church hypocrisy. In the second verse, Lecrae provide the solution to K.R.I.T.'s struggle and frustration. At a listening party for the album "Gravity", Lecrae described the theme of the song as about "'those days when we’re just throwing up a prayer.'" iHipHop appreciated the approach of the song, stating that "when it comes to rap with a positive message, it’s quite difficult for most artist to pull it off without sounding all preachy, and for the lack of a better term, corny. Apart from Lupe Fiasco, Lecrae is one of the few cats that kicks real world raps and not sound like a preacher." HipHopWired also praised Lecrae for managing to speak "on that real without sounding entirely too preachy" and elaborated that this "is a feat in today's pseudo-conscious rap, where a lot of MC's say as they do and not do as they say." In a review for "Day & A Dream", journalist Brando noted the performers evocation of their elders and stated how, especially in the Southern United States, grandmothers are "matriarchs to faith and stability and these two men know better than most to convey that message abroad."
AllHipHop stated that sonically, the song is the most "organic" track on the album. StupidDOPE said the track "brings back the raw hip-hop the industry seems to be in need of." NewReleaseTuesday noted the song’s role in the sequencing on the album, stating that the song’s smoother, R&B sound is a jarring transition from the dancehall vibe of the preceding track "Violence". The lush production style by DJ Khalil was described by "Complex" as "chaotic" and "funky", and StupidDOPE considered the beat "catchy". "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution" called the track a "massive song filled with crashing cymbals and thundering drums." Brando of "Day & A Dream" described the song as "soul wrenching" and "piano driven".
Critical reception.
After hearing "Gravity" at a private listening session, AllHipHop considered the song one of the standout tracks on the album. Rapzilla went further and said that the song is easily the best sonically, lyrically, and conceptually on the album. stupidDOPE praised Lecrae for "blending the heartfelt lyrics of the track with an awesome beat and undertone / melody." The rhymes by Big K.R.I.T. and Lecrae were described by HipHopWired as "perfectly fluid", with Ashthon Jones’ soulful vocals complimenting the lush production work by DJ Khalil. AllHipHop also praised Jones, describing her performance on the song's melody and hook as "beautiful", while "Respect Magazine" called Jones' vocals "captivating." The single's production work by DJ Khalil has also been praised, with Rapzilla stating that " provides the perfect backdrop for K.R.I.T. to walk into your church in the middle of service and express his frustrations with hypocrisies and for Crae to walk in behind him and calm the mob down while still co-signing K.R.I.T.’s verse." "RESPECT." called the instrumentation by Khalil "incredible."
Music video.
A music video was filmed for the song and was directed by Motion Family. The video aired December 13, 2012 on the MTV Networks channels MTV Jams, mtvU, and MTV2. It features Lecrae, Big K.R.I.T., and Ashthon Jones in a church attending the funeral service of a friend, with Big K.R.I.T. playing the church organ.

The song was conceived after the band had observed a growing number of US soldiers arriving in England in the late 1960s from the Vietnam War with severe drug addictions. It's about them taking drugs to forget the atrocities of war, only to see it catch up to them and slowly destroy them from the inside.

Samuel Hebich

Samuel Hebich (1803-1868) was one of the three pioneer Basel Mission missionaries to Southwestern India--Canara, Coorg, South Mahratta, Malabar, and Nilagiri. He along with Johann Christoph Lehner and Christian Leonard Greiner commenced Basel Mission station, the first German mission station in India, at Mangalore.
Biography.
He was born near Ulm, Württemberg in Germany. Having decided to set up institutions in parts of India that had not experienced German Protestant missionaries, the Basel Mission (BM) Society decided to send three missionaries to India. In 1834, he was one of the first three missionaries summoned by BM for missionary service in Southwestern India—BM Society became the second Continental Society other than the Tranqueba Mission to take up work in India - BM already had an institution to train missionaries. Although the institution didn't had plans to direct missionary work, yet they had trained people from the British and Dutch mission societies who were already enganged in evangelistic work. The largest number of trainees were supplied to Church Missionary Society and were sent to India to serve at their mission stations - Initially, East India Company didn't permit non-British missions to work in the territories occupied by them; however, with the revision of the Charter of 1833 removed that obstacle allowing non-British Missionary Societies to operate in Indian subcontinent—By 1821, the Basel Mission Society begun establishing mission stations of its own in Western Russia and Gold Coast in West Africa.
Johan Christopher Lehner, Christian Lenhard Greiner, and Samuel Hebich sailed to Malabar Coast boarding the ship "Malabar" on 15 July 1834, and they reached Kozhikode, also known as Calicut, on 14 October 1834. They were warmly received by Nelson, a British judge in Calicut. On hearing their mission to go Mangalore, Nelson wrote 
to his friend Findley Anderson, a Sub-collector of Mangalore, asking him to do all he could to help them. They finally arrived at Bokkapattana in Mangalore on 30 October 1834. With the help of Anderson, a house was bought from a Parsee for 4,900 rupees in Mangalore, that ultimately became the base for first German Basel Mission station in India.
Missionary work.
The missionaries soon acquired the local tongues like Kannada, Konkani, Tulu, and Malayalam; later, they engaged themselves in their missionary activities like preaching, constructing prayer halls, and converting British and Indian soldiers, including natives to Christianity with the help of British officials of East India Company. Samuel Hebich was exceptionally successful in the conversion of young British officers, in spite of his autocratic inclination made him a difficult person to work with.
Samuel established the mission stations at Mangalore and Cannanore, a unique Christian community base composed of British and Indian soldiers. By the mid of 19th century, the mission had grown with stations expanded to Belma in 1845, Mulki in 1845, Udupi in 1854, and Santhoor in 1865. Basel missionaries received substantial assistance from several British officials and planters, also continued after Indian subcontinent officially became part of British Raj.
Education mission.
The objectives of the commission that sent first three missionaires to Southwestern India was to establish schools and institutions to train future catechists. The mission education was considered important; hence, wherever there was to be a congregation, the mission had decided to have an elementary Christian teacher. Besides elementary education, they began training people to be catechists as early as 1840.
Agriculture mission.
The field experience soon made the missionaries that they needed to involve themselves in creating some remunerative jobs rather than just educating people. The missionaries also felt that the best way to fellowship with the converts was to keep them busy in some productive work. When the government of East India Company presented some piece of land to Samuel Hebich, he tried coffee plantation, however, he gave up as it didn't prove that successful. They also made an attempt to make sugar out of toddy, which proved too expensive because of the huge fuel costs.
The missionaries then thought of farming as many of the missionaries came from farming families; accordingly, the mission bought some land for agriculture and gave it on lease for cultivation. As very few took interest in cultivating the lands as their own, the agriculture settlements proved a partial failure, eventually to be discarded in 1880.
Industrial mission.
After the failure of Agriculture mission, the missionaries conceived of an Industrial establishment as an alternative for creating some remunerative jobs; accordingly, in 1846, the missionaries launched an Industrial school in Mangalore to train people in Weaving, Carpentry, Clock Making, and alike. In 1854, Watch and Clock making was given up as it was found not suitable to the requirements and capacity of the people.
Printing press with book binding department, another Industrial undertaking by missionaries, proved to be successful. After the Printing press started in 1841 at Mangalore, first Lithograph and later Kannada types were introduced. In 1851, a printer with Kannada fonts came from the Basel for the press at Mangalore. The press printed Christian books and books related to Literature, Science, and The arts providing employment to several souls.
After twenty-six years of missionary service, he returned to Germany in 1866 with failing health, and died in 1868.
Criticism.
His oversimplified preaching and evangelism against Hindu paganism aroused considerable criticism in India and Europe, especially from E.F. Langhans, a Swiss theologian. However, his twenty-five years of missionary service laid a solid foundation on which Indian church could be built.
