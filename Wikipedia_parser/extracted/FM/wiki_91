Andrew Porter (Civil War general)

Andrew Porter (July 10, 1820 – January 3, 1872) was an American army officer who was a brigadier general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He was an important staff officer under George B. McClellan during the 1862 Peninsula Campaign, serving as the Provost Marshal of the Army of the Potomac.
Early life and career.
Porter was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He was a grandson of Revolutionary War Andrew Porter; son of George Bryan Porter; and a second cousin of Mary Todd Lincoln. His younger first cousin, Horace Porter, also served as a Union general. He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, for six months in 1836 and 1837.
He served in the Mexican-American War as a first lieutenant in the 1st Mounted Rifles. Within a year, he was promoted to captain and cited for gallantry, being brevetted two grades to lieutenant colonel. Porter spent the next fourteen years serving at various posts and forts on the frontier. He fought a duel in Texas with future Confederate general James J. Archer, whose second was Thomas J. Jackson, later "Stonewall" Jackson. Porter married Margaretta Falconer (Margarite) Biddle Biddle (1825–1913) of the Biddle family. Her father was military officer and Michigan politician John Biddle (1792–1859). Her nephew was John Biddle (1859–1936), who became Superintendent of the United States Military Academy.
Civil War service.
On the outbreak of the Civil War he was serving as a colonel of the 16th U.S. Infantry. He was appointed as a brigadier general in May 1861, and commanded the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division at First Bull Run. He served as Provost Marshal of the District of Columbia, and was then appointed as Provost Marshal General of the Army of the Potomac in the Peninsula Campaign. In April 1864 he mustered out for health reasons.
Porter moved to Paris, France, in an attempt to improve his health. However, he died at his home there in 1872, and his remains were returned to the United States for burial in Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit, Michigan.
A photo of Porter by Mathew Brady circa 1862 survives.
His son John Biddle Porter was born September 5, 1858, and died June 21, 1915.
His cousin Horace Porter (1837–1921) also was a general in the civil war.

Stump harvesting

In plantation forests in parts of Europe, the tree stumps left after felling are now sometimes pulled out of the ground to supply wood fuel for biomass power stations. The stump is the base of the trunk and the attached woody roots. Tree stumps and roots are extracted using a hydraulic head on a tracked excavator or with a mechanical head equipped by special tool for a tractors. Stump harvesting is expected to provide an increasing component of the woody material required by the woody biomass power sector in Europe.
Sustainability.
Stump harvesting is unsuitable on many soils where the removal leads to long term reduction in nutrition or an unacceptable loss of soil carbon. Also, it is necessary that care is taken to avoid areas with archaeology, ecologically sensitive areas, steep slopes, and areas close to streams and rivers. In many situations removal of stumps leads to a further loss of wood with a resulting loss of the potential biodiversity that depends on wood.
History.
Stump harvesting is not a new process. Records of tree stumps being dug out of the ground for wood fuel go back hundreds of years in Europe. It was practiced in the 1970s in Swedish forests before declining in popularity, but is being considered again there now that there is a greater need for fuel wood. In Britain, stumps are removed in some forests for disease control, especially in south-east England. Additionally, they are extracted where restoring plantation forest areas to peat bog for conservation reasons. Recently small scale commercial stump harvesting has started in parts of Scotland to provide fuel for biomass power stations. In Finland, stumps were at one time used to produce tar and charcoal. In the 1970s, a number of trials were set up in Finland to examine the viability of stump harvesting for woody biomass, but it is only in recent years that it has developed into a large scale commercial operation.

Church of Nossa Senhora da Conceição da Muxima

The Church of Our lady of Muxima (in Portuguese, "Igreja da Nossa Senhora da Conceição da Muxima") resides in the Bengo Province of Angola. A 16th Century Portuguese Colonial structure, the church was an important center in the slave trade at the time.
History.
Standing on the left border of the Kwanza River, district of Muxirna, province of Bengo, this church is a contemporary of the Fortress of C`Muxima'7. The village of Muxirna was occupied by the Portuguese in 1589 and ten years later (1599), the Fortress was founded and the church was built with a prayer invoking divine blessing from "Nossa Senhora da Muxirna". Muxima was an important empire of slaves traffic, protected by the Fortress, and the church played an important role in the materialization of the traffic, because it was in this religious local, where the slaves were baptized before being deported. It is spacious and strong building with a stern, typically Portuguese architecture, built on the border of the Kwanza River. This popular sanctuary was spoiled and set on fire by the Netherlanders in 1641, when they enclosed Muxima. Later, it was modified. The Sanctuary with the Virgin image has been a Center of great devotion from Christians, for generations and generations. It was classified as National Monument by Provincial Decret n. 2, 12 of January of 1924. It is relatively in good order and belongs to the Catholic Church. The responsibility for its maintenance and preservation concerns the Ministry of Culture. 
World Heritage Status.
This site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on November 22, 1996 in the Cultural category.

Infamous Murders

Infamous Murders was a documentary television series shown on The History Channel in the U.S. and the U.K. The U.S. edition was narrated by Don Peoples. In the U.K. edition the narrator is uncredited.
Overview.
The 51 episodes of the series were produced by Nugus/Martin Productions Ltd. in 2001. The show was aired on The History Channel in both the U.K. and U.S. In the U.S. the show was included as part of the 154 episode run of History's Mysteries. During the hour long show, two episodes of "Infamous Murders" were presented together.
Each episode was thirty minutes long. Three crimes that share a common theme such as motive, means, or victims are given ten minutes of time apiece. The series concentrated on notorious murders carried out during the 20th century. In the beginning of each show a particularly infamous crime would be examined as an example. The words “Infamous Murders now examines…” would follow and the other three murders would be presented.
The series relied on historical documents for visuals rather than reenactments. Dramatic music was used to heighten the narration along with rostrum shots of photographs, and vintage television/film footage.
Reruns of the show could be seen on The History Channel, the Crime & Investigation Network, Biography Channel, and History International. After History International became H2 in 2011, the rights to the series were discontinued.
A 17 disc DVD version of the series was released in the U.K. as "" by Odeon Entertainment in 2002. Each disc contains three episodes.

St. John's Cathedral, Cashel

Saint John the Baptist and Saint Patrick's Rock is a cathedral of the Church of Ireland in Cashel, County Tipperary in Ireland. It is in the ecclesiastical province of Dublin.
Previously the cathedral of the Diocese of Cashel, it is now one of six cathedrals in the United Dioceses of Cashel Ferns and Ossory.
Ecclesiastical history.
Following the English Reformation, the Church of Ireland was separated from Rome and by decree of the Irish Parliament, under English domination, it became the established Church in the Kingdom of Ireland. The Church of Ireland retained most Church property (and so preserved a great repository of religious architecture and other items, though some were later destroyed). The great majority of the population, especially outside the Pale, however, remained faithful to the See of Rome, despite the political and economic advantages of membership in the now separated and established Church of Ireland. Since the historic cathedral on the Rock of Cashel was affected in this way, Roman Catholic adherents were consequently obliged to worship elsewhere.
The historic cathedral on the Rock of Cashel was closed for worship in 1721. Meanwhile the old parish church of St John was removed and the present Georgian cathedral completed in 1784. Its famous Samuel Green organ was built in 1786.

Emanuel Goldberg

Emanuel Goldberg (; ; ) (born: 31 August 1881; died: 13 September 1970) was an Israeli physicist and inventor. He was born in Moscow and moved first to Germany and later to Israel. He described himself as "“a chemist by learning, physicist by calling, and a mechanic by birth.”" He contributed a wide range of theoretic and practical advances relating to light and media and was the founding head of Zeiss Ikon, the famous photographic products company in Dresden, Germany. His inventions include microdots, the Kinamo movie camera, the Contax 35 mm camera, a very early search engine, and equipment for sensitometry.
Biography.
Goldberg was born in Moscow on 31 August 1881 (19 August 1881 in the Old Style, Julian calendar, sometimes given in error as 1 September) the son of Grigorii Ignat’evich Goldberg, a distinguished Colonel (Polkovnik) in the Tsar’s military medical corps and his wife Olga Moiseevna Grodsenka. Earlier interested in engineering, he studied Chemistry at the University of Moscow and at several German universities, and remained in Germany after 1904 to avoid antisemitism in Russia. In 1906 he received a Ph.D from the University of Leipzig for research at the Institute for Physical Chemistry, led by Wilhelm Ostwald on the kinetics of photochemical reactions. After a year as assistant to in the Photochemistry Laboratory at the Technical University in Charlottenburg, Berlin, he became head of the photographic department of the Royal Academy of Graphic Arts and Bookcraft, in Leipzig from 1907 to 1917.
In 1917 Goldberg was recruited by the Carl Zeiss Stiftung to become a director of its photographic products subsidiary Ica (Internationale Camera Aktien Gesellschaft) in Dresden where he introduced the spring-driven Kinamo movie camera. In 1926 a “Fusion” of four leading photographic firms (Contessa, Ernemann, Ica and Goerz) formed Zeiss Ikon under Goldberg’s leadership until he was kidnapped by Nazis in 1933 and fled to Paris. After four years working for Zeiss subsidiaries in France, Goldberg moved to Palestine in 1937 where he established a laboratory, later called Goldberg Instruments, which became the Electro-Optical Industries (“El-Op”) in Rehovot. A photograph taken 1943 by John Phillips for Life Magazine shows Goldberg in his work shop in Palestine. He retired in 1960 but continued his research and died in Tel Aviv on 13 September 1970.
Early inventions.
Goldberg patented improved methods for electroplating zinc on iron in 1902 and published numerous technical papers on improved printing techniques, reducing moiré effects in half-tone printing, photoengraving and other topics. In 1910 he became well known for an improved method for making neutral gelatin wedges (“Goldberg wedge”) that was widely used in sensitometry and the , an instrument that greatly reduced the labor required to measure the characteristic curves of photographic emulsions.
At Ica, foreseeing a growing market in amateur and semi-professional movies, he designed an extremely compact 35 mm movie camera, the Kinamo, introduced in 1921 with a spring motor attachment added in 1923 to allow flexible handheld filming. Goldberg made films of himself and his family as promotional shorts and, in 1927, a skiing drama, "“Ein Sprung . . . Ein Traum.”" The Kinamo was used by Joris Ivens and other avant-garde and documentary filmmakers in the late 1920s and early 1930s.
In 1925 Goldberg demonstrated and published a technique for making microdot (Mikrat nach Goldberg) at a resolution equivalent to the text 50 complete Bibles per square inch. This invention has been widely attributed to a mythical “Professor Zapp” based on J. Edgar Hoover’s erroneous article in the April 1946 Readers Digest, probably a confusion with Kurt Zapp who trained German spies in microdot photography during the Second World War. In 1937, Goldberg presented a paper at the World Congress of Universal Documentation on an early copying camera he had invented.
At Ica and Zeiss Ikon Goldberg was involved in many innovations and led the design of famous Contax 35 mm still camera.
Goldberg was best known for his extensive studies in sensitometry summarized in his book "Der Aufbau des photographisches Bildes" (1922) and the "“Goldberg Condition”" (Goldberg Bedingung), a design principle for high quality reproduction in two stage, negative-positive photographic processes better known in English as “the gamma rule.”
Goldberg and his former teacher and collaborator were instrumental in the acceptance at the International Congress of Photography in Dresden in 1931 of the widely adopted German national film speed standard DIN 4512. At the same Congress Goldberg introduced his “Statistical Machine,” a document search engine that used photoelectric cells and pattern recognition to search the metadata on rolls of microfilmed documents (US patent 1,838,389, 29 December 1931). This technology was used in a variant form in 1938 by Vannevar Bush in his “microfilm rapid selector,” his “comparator” (for cryptanalysis), and was the technological basis for the imaginary Memex in Bush’s influential 1945 essay “As we may think.”
Educational and service activities.
In Germany Goldberg was noted for his educational displays at exhibitions, served as consultant on aerial photography in the First World War, and was a consultant to the Carl Zeiss firm in Jena. In Palestine and later Israel he was deeply engaged as an advisory to both civilian and military spheres. The apprenticeship scheme that he introduced in Tel Aviv provided advanced technical skills to many who went on to develop the Israeli high tech industry.
Awards.
In 1968, Goldberg was awarded the Israel Prize, in exact science. 
Personal life.
On 28 June 1907 Goldberg married Sophie Posniak (28 August 1886 - 10 December 1968). They had a son, Herbert Goldberg (b. 20 November 1914) and a daughter Renate Eva, now Chava Gichon (b. 19 September 1922).
In 1990 Chava Gichon (Tel-Aviv) requested restitution of the property in the Oeserstraße 5 in Dresden, which Goldberg as director of Zeiss-Ikon had bought in 1927, but the real estate office did not approve an intended agreement with the owner at that time in August 1995.

Bare-fronted Hoodwink

The Bare-fronted Hoodwink ("Dissimulatrix spuria") was a hoax and satirical wastebasket species of bird created by ornithologist Maury F.A. Meiklejohn.
The Hoodwink has the ability to be "almost seen" or "almost captured". Bird watchers can easily identify this bird by its "blurred appearance and extremely rapid flight away from the observer." Meiklejohn claimed that the single species could easily account for every bird not completely sighted.
Birdwatchers added this species to their list of birds to watch for, and amateurs seemed to sight the Hoodwink more often.
On April 1, 1975, the bird was put on display at the Royal Scottish Museum at Edinburgh. The exhibit also included photos of blurry birds flying away. The bird was created using the head of a Carrion Crow, the body of a Plover, and the feet of an unknown waterfowl. The bare front was compromised with wax.
Meiklejohn's paper was published in the scientific journal "Bird Notes" in 1950. The paper was rather long and humorous, and he even claimed the genus to be descendant of an ancient species "Paleodissimulatrix".

Blackburn Second Monoplane

The Blackburn Second Monoplane was strongly influenced by the French "Antoinette" and was much more successful than Robert Blackburn's first aircraft. The lone aircraft was built in Leeds, UK in 1910.
Development.
The First Monoplane was not a success, barely leaving the ground before crashing. His second machine, the Second Monoplane was very different, and resembled Léon Levavasseur's Antoinette design which Blackburn had seen in France.
The monoplane wing was rectangular with constant chord, significant dihedral and square tips, and had a thin aerofoil section cambered on the underside, as was usual at the time. Lateral control was by wing warping. The wing was wire braced via a king post passing through the fuselage, extending both above and below. The fuselage was, like the wings, a wooden structure covered with fabric, triangular in section and tapering towards the tail. This was characteristically "Antoinette" with long finely tapering fin and tailplane, the rudder being divided into two triangular sections above and below the elevator, giving it clearance to move.
The pilot's seat was at the trailing edge of the wing, and contained Blackburn's "triple steering column" which was moved up and down for elevator control, from side to side to warp the wings and rotated to move the rudders. This system had been used on the First Monoplane. The undercarriage main axle was carried at the bottom end of the kingpost with wheels at either end and bearing ash fore and aft skids. During development and taxying trial, this structure was braced and sprung in different ways before the undercarriage was deemed satisfactory.
Flying was delayed by the choice of a new untried engine, a seven-cylinder radial designed by R.J.Issacson of the Hunslet Engine Co. of Leeds. This drove a wooden two-blade airscrew via a 2:1 reduction gear.
The aircraft was taken to Filey on the English east coast for testing on the sands with B.C.Hucks at the controls. On 8 March 1911, after taxying for several miles, he made the first takeoff. He flew successfully for a while at about 30 ft (10 m) and 50 mph (80 km/h), but he sideslipped into the sands when attempting his first turn.
Despite this mishap, after repair the Second Monoplane did good service at Filey as an instructional aircraft, bringing publicity to Blackburn's name and later machines.

John Stanley Pottinger

J. Stanley Pottinger has been a Washington bureaucrat, a lawyer, investment banker, and novelist. Pottinger was born in Dayton Ohio.
He was educated at Harvard University and Harvard Law School, graduating with a JD in 1965.[http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/guides/Finding%20Aids/Pottinger,_J_Stanley_-_Papers%20.htm]
Pottinger held significant roles as a bureaucratic appointee in the Nixon, Ford and Carter Administrations. From 1970 to 1973, he held the position of the Director of the Office of Civil Rights, at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare from 1970-1973 and from 1973-77 served as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights in the United States Department of Justice.
Bob Woodward told the story in his book "The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat" (ISBN 0-7432-8715-0) that during a 1976 grand jury appearance over break-ins ordered by Mark Felt, Pottinger discovered that Felt was Deep Throat. During the grand jury hearing, a juror asked Felt, who was testifying, whether he was Deep Throat. Pottinger says that Felt went white with fear. Pottinger instructed Felt that while Felt was under oath and had to answer truthfully, but Pottinger considered the question to be beyond the scope of the inquiry and would be withdrawn if Felt wanted. Felt successfully requested the inquiry to be withdrawn.
Pottinger later engaged in a lucrative practice on Wall Street and wrote a best selling book, "The Fourth Procedure",[http://articles.latimes.com/1995-06-11/news/ls-11853_1_stanley-pottinger] as well as several other novels.
In 2013, Pottinger was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the "Hollingsworth v. Perry" case.[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/02/28/the-pro-freedom-republicans-are-coming-131-sign-gay-marriage-brief.html]

<doc id="21612129" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21612129" title="Helene Curtis Industries, Inc.">
Helene Curtis Industries, Inc.

Helene Curtis Industries, Inc. was a cosmetics and beauty parlor products firm which was based in Chicago, Illinois. The company acquired a hair-coloring line by the acquisition of a competitor business. Later the retailer diversified into the field of personal care products, manufacturing Degree among other items.
Corporation history.
Helene Curtis was founded in Chicago in 1927 as the National Mineral Company by two partners, Gerald Gidwitz and Louis Stein. The company started out manufacturing a facial mudpack product, sold to beauty salons nationwide. The partners soon shifted the company's emphasis to haircare products (also sold to beauty salons), starting with a line of "machineless" waving pads, drastically simplifying the permanent wave process.
The company developed Lanolin Creme Shampoo, one of the nation's first detergent-based shampoos, in the mid-1930s. The popularity of the shampoo, available only in beauty salons, prompted the company to follow it up with Suave Hairdressing in 1937. The demand for the hair tonic became so great, the company began manufacturing small retail sizes for salon resale. Suave would eventually become one of the company's flagship product lines.
During World War II, the company's name changed to National Industries, Inc., and factories were converted to manufacture non-haircare-related items for the war effort, including aircraft gun turrets, electric motors and radar equipment.
After the war, National Industries shifted back to personal care products. The company was renamed Helene Curtis after the first names of partner Louis Stein's wife and son. Suave Hairdressing and Lanolin Creme Shampoo were soon introduced for general retail sale, and quickly began outselling the competition. In March 1948 Kraft Foods purchased property owned by the company to use for its offices and warehouses, and Helene Curtis relocated to a new corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility.
In 1950 Helene Curtis developed the generic term "hairspray" for its new aerosol product, Spray Net. Other successful, and effective, products introduced during the 1950s included the spray-on deodorant Stopette (acquired in 1958 from its founder, Chicago-based chemist and inventor Jules Montenier) and a nonprescription dandruff shampoo called Enden. These two products were advertised on television during such shows as "What's My Line?" and "The Gale Storm Show", helping to make Stopette the best selling deodorant on the market, a position it maintained for several years.
The company expanded its product line with several acquisitions, including Kings Men male toiletries, Lentheric fragrances, and Studio Girl cosmetics. By the mid-1950s, Helene Curtis products were being manufactured and sold in 25 countries. In 1956, Helene Curtis went public after 32 years of private ownership (although the Gidwitz family held most of the voting shares until the company's 1996 takeover by Unilever).
In the early 1960s the company began to build on the success of its Suave brand, introducing shampoos, creme rinses, and wave sets. In 1961 Helene Curtis's stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and by the middle of the decade the company had licensed its products in 81 countries. Also in 1961, Helene Curtis Industries began to challenge Avon in the field of door-to-door cosmetics sales.
Ronald J. Gidwitz, son of co-founder Gerald Gidwitz, took over as CEO in 1985. Norm Jeanis District Manager. 
In the 1970s and 1980s, the Suave brand was one of the best selling personal care lines in America and was successfully extended into deodorants and skin creams; the company followed up on that success by introducing the Finesse and (the professional-caliber) Salon Selectives brands. By 1989, Suave, Finesse and Salon Selectives were among the top ten national shampoo brands.
In 1990 Helene Curtis introduced "Degree" antiperspirant, at that time the company's most successful new product launch. With a formula activated as body heat rises, and aided by a $50 million advertising campaign, Degree quickly found a large share of the market, achieving the company's market share goal for the brand's first year in only eight months. By the end of fiscal 1992 Helene Curtis had attained the billion dollar mark with total sales of $1.02 billion. 
As the decade of the 1990s progressed, despite its best efforts, record sales, facilities expansion, and advertising budgets approaching $80 million and up, it became clear that Helene Curtis was too small compared to its larger rivals. The firm did not have the resources to compete on an international scale with the likes of Procter & Gamble and Unilever. In February 1996, Helene Curtis agreed to be acquired by Unilever for about $770 million.
In contract law, the company is known for the 1963 case, Helene Curtis Industries, Inc. v. United States, in which the Superior knowledge doctrine was born. 
In 1998 the beauty manufacturer had a production site in Rolling Meadows, Illinois.

William Norton (rugby player)

William Barron Norton (28 April 1862-17 December 1898) was a Welsh international rugby union three-quarter who played club rugby for Cardiff Rugby Football Club and international rugby for Wales. He was awarded six caps for Wales.
Rugby career.
Norton was one of the earliest Welsh internationals and first represented his country in 1882, in the team's first ever encounter with Ireland. Captained by Charles Lewis, Norton entered a team containing ten new caps, after the Welsh team were humiliated in their inaugural game against England. Wales won the game making it the very first international victory for the team. Norton was reselected for the next five matches, completing the entirety of the 1883 and 1884 Home Nations Championships. Wales lost both games of the 1883 Championship, and the opening two games of the 1884 tournament, but were successful for the final game of the series against Ireland. The 1884 Irish game saw the Ireland team arrive two players short and were forced to borrow two Welsh players to complete their team. Although the last game of Norton's international career, he ended by scoring his only try for his country.

Carson Brewer (February 2, 1920 — January 15, 2003) was an American journalist and conservationist, best known for his work documenting the folk life of Knoxville and the surrounding Appalachian communities in East Tennessee. During his 40-year career as a columnist for the "Knoxville News-Sentinel", Brewer was a key voice for the promotion and protection of the region's natural wonders, especially the Great Smoky Mountains. His historical work included the first extensive history of the Little Tennessee River valley and one of the first comprehensive histories of the Tennessee Valley Authority.
Brewer was born in Hancock County, Tennessee in 1920, the son of a local postmaster. He attended Maryville College for two years before joining the U.S. Army in 1941 at the outbreak of World War II. After the war, Brewer attended the University of Tennessee, but due to illness, he never obtained a degree. He joined the staff of the "News-Sentinel" in 1945, and in 1948 he married pioneering female journalist Alberta Trulock (1917—2007).
Brewer wrote several books on the Great Smoky Mountains, most notably "Hiking in the Great Smoky Mountains" (1962), which was reprinted several times over three decades. In 1969, the Tennessee Valley Authority— which was planning to flood the Little Tennessee River valley by constructing Tellico Dam at the river's mouth— hired Brewer and his wife Alberta to compile a history of the valley and its inhabitants. Their work was published by the East Tennessee Historical Society in 1975 under the title, "Valley So Wild: A Folk History". In the early 1980s, Brewer wrote a series of articles documenting the history of the Tennessee Valley Authority and its effects on the inhabitants of East Tennessee. He retired from the "News-Sentinel" in 1985, but continued writing until his death in 2003.

Julien (opera)

Julien, ou La vie du poète ("Julien, or The Poet’s Life") is a poème lyrique or opera by composer Gustave Charpentier. The work is devised in a prologue and four acts and uses a French libretto by the composer. "Julien" is a sequel to Charpentier's "Louise" (1900) and describes the artistic aspirations of Louise’s suitor Julien. The opera premiered in Paris at the Opéra-Comique on 4 June 1913.
History.
Like "Louise", "Julien"'s plot is somewhat autobiographical and requires many characters and chorus roles, with the main female lead portraying four smaller characters in addition to the role of Louise. The opera integrates elements of an earlier piece, "La Vie du Poète", a symphony-drama of 1888–1889. The chorus consists largely of ‘filles du rêve’ (girls of the dream), fairies, and chimeras as well as various men's roles, mainly different kinds of working class men. Charpentier described how, except for the prologue, "Louise and the various characters who surround Julien are not so much real people as an exteriorized realization of their inner souls". The opera was not well received and apart from two productions in 1914, one of which was at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City with Geraldine Farrar and Enrico Caruso in the main roles, it has not been revived. The work did, however, gain the admiration of Gabriel Fauré who admired its expressionist qualities.
Synopsis.
Prologue.
"Enthousiasme ("Filled with enthusiasm")"
Julien, as a Prix de Rome winner, is studying in Rome at the Villa Medici. This resembles the life of Charpentier as he too was a Prix de Rome winner. However, after this point, the opera moves from the real world into the imagination until the final tableau, set in Montmartre, returns the plot to reality.
Act 1.
"Au pays du rêve ("In dreamland")"
It contains three settings: the Holy Mountain, followed by a setting in the Accursed Valley, and lastly the Temple of Beauty.
Act 2.
This takes place in the Slovakian countryside and follows Julien as he experiences doubts in creating his artwork.
Act 3.
"Impuissance" ("Impotence")"
This is located in Brittany's wild countryside.
Act 4.
"Ivresse ("Intoxication")"
Set in Montmartre, it closes in the Place Blanche with the sudden appearance of the Temple of Beauty.

Chima is a type of skirt worn together with "jeogori", or a short jacket in hanbok, Korean traditional clothing. It is also referred to as "sang" () or "gun" () in hanja in the Korean language.
Basic forms of ancient "chima" can be seen in murals of Goguryeo kingdom (37 BC–668 AD), built approximately during the 4th or 6th century. Women in the upper class wore a long "chima" which falls down to the floor while women in the lower class wore a shorter "chima" which length reaches to the calf of the leg. In addition, Goguryeo women also wore "saekdong chima" that is a colorfully striped skirt by patchworking, and a "chima" in form of gored skirt, made by sewing several pieces of fabric without gathering.

The Grande Prairie Public Library serves a population of 30,985 in the communities of Hazel Crest, Illinois and Country Club Hills, Illinois. It is located at 3479 W. 183rd Street in Hazel Crest, in the south suburbs of Chicago. The library is a member of the Metropolitan Library System.
Early history of the Hazel Crest Library.
The original Hazel Crest Library was established in 1930 by the Professional Women's Club and housed in a room in the Roosevelt School. The library was staffed by volunteers. When the school was renovated and renamed the Warren Palm School in 1931, the library moved into a portable building on the school grounds. When the Warren Palm School continued its expansion in 1951, the library lost its space and discontinued service. The remaining books were donated to the school.
Early history of the Country Club Hills Library.
The original Country Club Hills Public Library, established in 1960, consisted of donated books and was located in one room of the old city hall building. In 1964, the library moved into the newly built Civic Center and expanded its space in 1966. The first full-time professional librarian was hired in 1973.
History of the Grande Prairie Public Library.
In September 1974, the city of Country Club Hills passed a referendum to establish the Country Club Hills Library District. The following year, the city of Hazel Crest was annexed to the district. In 1978, the library moved into a temporary space in the Stonebridge Shopping Center in Hazel Crest.
In May 1977, the name of the library district was changed to Grande Prairie Public Library District to better reflect the heritage of both communities.
In September 1979, residents of Hazel Crest and Country Club Hills approved a $1.1 million bond for the construction of a new library building. The building at 3479 W. 183rd Street, designed by the architectural firm Holabird & Root (originally Holabird & Roche), opened to the public on April 12, 1982.
Floor plan of the library.
The two-story building houses adult materials upstairs, including fiction and non-fiction, periodicals, DVDs, VHS cassettes, CDs, and Audiobooks on CD and cassette. Also located upstairs are ten, public-access internet computers (managed by reservation), three online catalogs, and black/white printing and copying capabilities. Downstairs, the library houses youth materials, including a variety similar to the adult materials. The youth department hosts five filtered internet computers and three online catalogs. Also located downstairs are the library's large meeting and small conference rooms, along with a color copier and an additional black/white copier.
Family restrooms are located on each floor. An elevator is available to serve patrons and staff.

David Keck

David Keck is a Canadian author, and teacher, who has Masters Degrees in English Literature, History, and Education. He is best known for his novels based around the protagonist Durand Col. His works have received generally positive reviews from critics, yet have not reached the mainstream so far.
Biography.
David Keck was born in, and grew up in, Winnipeg, Canada. Whilst living in Winnipeg he attended the University of Winnipeg, where he got Masters Degrees in English Literature, History, and Education. He subsequently moved to the UK to get a Masters Degree in Creative Writing from the University of Sussex. In 2004 he moved to New York, America, to marry Kate Brallier (an author herself), and to teach middle school in New York’s Washington Heights.
Works.
Keck's novels are all based around the actions of protagonist Durand Col, yet there is currently no series name. The first novel in the series was "In the Eye of Heaven", and was published in the UK in 2006, and the US and Canada in 2007, by Tor. The novel went through many versions before publication, with fellow Canadian author, Steven Erikson, having a hand in reading and editing the drafts. Keck's writing style has been compared to Erikson, mainly because he likes to go against the grain. He says that he "flinch at an elf who's a dab hand with a longbow. Conventions and clichés: it's all in the smiles and cringes."

Bay Point Schools

Bay Point Schools is an accredited alternative public school and outreach program for young teens that get in trouble with the law. It is a program that gives teens a second chance on life. The students are sent by the courts and come from all over the state of Florida.

Bay Point Schools Miami-Dade County public alternative school, that reaches out towards troubled teens. The school's focus is turning troubled boys into productive citizens. The program is includes a student government status system that emphasizes positive peer pressure. It has mental health therapies such as aggression replacement and multi-systemic therapy.
Founder and Head.
Dr. Mary Louis Cole is the founder and head of bay point school. Dr. Cole earned a PhD in education from the University of Miami. She also became the executive director of the Children’s Home Society (CHS)-Southeast Division in 1998. During her 11-year tenure, CHS grew from a small adoption agency to a $12 million agency with nine children’s homes throughout Miami-Dade County. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew destroyed almost all of South Dade County. Dr. Cole established an Interfaith Coalition to organize and support hundreds of church volunteers coming to South Dade to help in the rebuilding effort.
Bay Point History.
In 1995, concerned with the runaway statistics of youth crime, Dr. Cole created a radical and innovative approach that would later prove to capture national attention. The Bay Point property was purchased in 1994 by the Ethel and George W. Kennedy Family Foundation. Located on within a mangrove ecosystem, this tropical setting in South Dade had previously been one of the army’s Hawk missile sites.
The Kennedy family supported Dr. Cole’s philosophy that troubled juveniles could be guided into becoming successful members of the community. Dr. Cole began Bay Point with an AmeriCorps grant and her own private funds. She received her first contract from the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) in 1995. Bay Point began as a pilot program for 36 at-risk youths with a unique model designed to be different from the usual juvenile detention or half-way house model. The program became so successful that it has now expanded to four campuses with over 241 beds. Bay Point Schools also has a private student campus that invites parents to place out-of-control teenage boys into the successful Bay Point program. The school is no longer a part of the DJJ system.
Bay Point North.
Bay Point North campus is located in Miami Gardens. It is a program providing rehabilitation and treatment to youth classified a moderate risk to public safety with an approximate length of stay of 6 – 9 months. This model is based on the foundation of the boarding school concept, which focuses on education, strong leadership, accountability and self-discipline. Youth are court ordered into the program. The program focuses on four areas of growth: academics, athletics, socialization and vocations, and provides the foundation for success by arming each youth with an education and goals for the future. Offenders learn self-discipline and prepare for entering the workforce or college. It currently has a capacity of 28 male offenders, aged 13–15.

John Mortimer Smith

John Mortimer Fourette Smith (born June 23, 1935) is an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as the ninth Bishop of Trenton, having previously served as Bishop of Pensacola-Tallahassee from 1991 to 1995. He is currently the Bishop Emeritus of Trenton, having been succeeded upon his retirement for age reasons by his Coadjutor Bishop, former Catholic University of America President David M. O'Connell, on Wednesday, December 1, 2010.
Early life.
John Smith was born in Orange, New Jersey, to Mortimer and Ethel (née Charnock) Smith. The oldest of three children, he has two brothers, Andrew (who later became a Benedictine monk) and Gregory. He attended Saint Benedict's Preparatory School in Newark and John Carroll University in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1955, he entered Immaculate Conception Seminary, a branch of Seton Hall University, from where he obtained a Bachelor's degree in classical languages in 1957.
Priesthood.
Smith was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Thomas Boland on May 27, 1961. He then served as Assistant Chancellor, Defender of the Bond of the Metropolitan Tribunal, and director of the Cursillo movement for the Archdiocese of Newark.
Smith earned a Bachelor's degree in Sacred Theology (1961) and a doctorate in canon law (1966) from the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. He was also a visiting professor of pastoral theology at his "alma mater" of the Immaculate Conception Seminary, an elected representative on the Archdiocesan Council of Priests, and dean of central Bergen County. Smith was raised to the rank of Papal Chamberlain by Pope Paul VI in 1971, and assigned to the team ministry of St. Joseph Church in Oradell in 1973.
In 1982, he became a member of the faculty of the Pontifical North American College in Rome, where Smith served as director of the Institute for Continuing Theological Education and program director of the U.S. Bishops' Consultation IV. Upon his return to the United States in 1986, he was named pastor of St. Mary's Church in Dumont and later vicar general and moderator of the curia.
Episcopal career.
On November 20, 1987, Smith was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Newark and Titular Bishop of "Tres Tabernae" by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on January 25, 1988 from Archbishop Theodore McCarrick, with Archbishop Peter Gerety and Bishop Walter Curtis serving as co-consecrators.
Bishop of Pensacola-Tallahassee.
Smith was later named the third Bishop of Pensacola-Tallahassee, Florida, on June 25, 1991. He was formally installed on July 31 of that year.
Bishop of Trenton.
On November 21, 1995, Smith was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Trenton in his native New Jersey. He succeeded John C. Reiss as the ninth Bishop of Trenton upon the latter's resignation on June 30, 1997.
In 2002, Smith removed a priest accused of molesting a young boy from an administrative position in the diocese. The diocese had reported the allegation to the Monmouth County prosecutor's office when it was first made in 1990, but prosecutors had decided not to file criminal charges because of insufficient evidence. Smith relieved the priest of his duties following a review of personnel files to ensure the public's confidence in the clergy.
On Wednesday, December 1, 2010, his resignation for reasons of age was accepted by Pope Benedict XVI, and his Coadjutor Bishop, David M. O'Connell, the former President of the Catholic University of America, succeeded him as the tenth Bishop of Trenton (he had reached the age of 75 in June 2010, which is when bishops must submit their letter of resignation to the Pope for possible acceptance; Bishop O'Connell was named as Coadjutor Bishop that month).

<doc id="21612383" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21612383" title="The Flapjack Contest">
The Flapjack Contest

The Flapjack Contest is the 183rd episode of "Bonanza". It aired on January 3, 1965.
Summary.
Having entered the titular contest, Hoss Cartwright is put on a starvation diet by his brother Joe to ensure victory. Meanwhile, several other plot strands are woven into the proceedings, involving a bank heist, a glib con artist, a phony ruby-and an abundance of hilarious property damage.
Full Plot.
Ben and Hoss are at the dining table eating breakfast, when Ben tells Hoss to go and get his brother Joe to wake up. Ben is not happy about Joe’s poker playing and his coming in at all hours of the night. Hoss throws water at Joe and Hoss ducks a boot that Joe throws at him barely missing it. The boot goes through the window shattering it. When Joe finally wakes up he complains of a headache from a nasty bump on his head but Hoss doesn’t seem to very interested in hearing about it. 
Hoss asks Joe what time he got in the night before and Joe answers that he got in around four in the morning. He had been playing poker and ended up with a hundred dollars, but had been bushwhacked on the way home. Ben reminds Joe to get a new window pane, He also reminds Hoss to check for the package that Adam sent home with an uncut ruby in it worth one thousand dollars. Joe heads over to the saloon to see if the guy he feels that bushwhacked him is there. The bartender asks Joe if he is going to be in the big flapjack contest on Founder’s Day. Joe laughs until he hears that Trager, the man he thinks bushwhacked him, is taking bets on the contest as to who will win. Joe bets one hundred dollars that Trager’s man, Big Ed, won’t win. Joe meets up with Hoss and Hoss asks what Joe has been doing in the saloon all morning. Joe informs Hoss that he signed him up for the flapjack eating contest and put in a bet. Hoss informs Joe that he is going to get into trouble. Joe says that Adam is going to be mad if he doesn’t have one thousand dollars before he gets back. Hoss asks why and Joe tells him that when he was bushwhacked that they not only stole his hundred dollars but a plain package picked up from the post office with an uncut ruby in it. Hoss says Joe should tell Ben, but Joe asks Hoss to visualize what would happen when he told Ben the truth. Hoss then begins to agree with Joe and becomes part of Joe’s scheme. 
Joe comes back to the ranch and Ben asks Joe where Hoss is. Joe informs him that he is walking home to get hungry for the flapjack contest. Ben tells Joe to put in the window pane and Joe says he forgot it and will go back to get it. Ben tells him just to unload the supplies and Joe jumps in the back and crushes the window that Hoss had picked up. At dinner, Hoss is excited to finally get food and when he finds out that all he’ll get to eat is a salad, he gets upset but does eat it because of his promise to Joe. 
Later that night, Hoss sneaks downstairs to sneak some food, but Joe has rigged pots and pans on the stairs and Hoss trips over them. Joe wakes up when he hears the clatter and tells Hoss that he will be downstairs making sure that Hoss can’t get to the kitchen. Hoss goes upstairs still hungry as Ben continues to yell for the boys to get upstairs. 
Hoss and Joe go into town and Joe goes into the saloon. Hoss says to keep out of trouble. Joe is drinking a beer when Trager comes up and Joe somehow bets five hundred more dollars that Hoss will beat Big Ed. Hoss comes in and asks Joe how much is riding on the contest and he tells Hoss that it’ll be fine as they’ll end up with a nice profit and enough to pay Adam back for his ruby that Joe lost. Hoss then asks what will happen if Big Ed wins and Joe says that he’ll owe twenty-five hundred dollars. Hoss gets angry and Trager and Big Ed watch from a table nearby. Hoss asks for beer, but Joe won’t let him. Joe asks Hoss if he got the window pane and Hoss says the store doesn’t have anymore. Sam says that it’s sort of his fault because he bought five of them to replace the windows that were broken in the saloon upstairs. Joe says he will rent a room for a week if he can have the window out of it. Sam agrees. 
While Joe is upstairs getting the new window, Lily, a barmaid, says that she had brought Sam a pie for his birthday that was a month ago. Sam says it is absolutely delicious. Hoss is standing right beside Lily and she asks him if she wants any. Hoss says he can’t do it, but Lily keeps on trying to get Hoss to eat it. Joe comes down and gets angry at Lily. She gets angry at Joe and throws the pie at Joe. Joe ducks and it hits Hoss in the face. 
When they get back, Joe goes to find a safe place for the window pane and then he and Hoss head for the high pasture. When they get back, Ben tells Joe to put up his horse because he is tired. Hoss tells Joe how he is going to go lie down on the sofa when he gets done in the barn. Joe suddenly remembers that he put the window pane on the sofa. Joe runs towards the house, but Ben has already cracked the window pane and is extremely angry at Joe. 
That night, Hoss sneaks to the kitchen again and thinks that Joe is asleep. He crawls to the kitchen just to make sure that Joe doesn’t hear him. Hoss screams when he gets caught in a mouse trap and Ben comes down and asks what the heck was going on. Ben threatens to put them in the barn if they keep it up and everyone is glad that the contest is the next day.
The next morning, the contest starts and Ben tells Joe to go get another window pane since the contest will last an hour. Meanwhile, Trager pulls a gun on the bank teller and says to empty all the cash into his briefcase. He is leaving the bank when the bank teller comes out and yells for someone to stop the man that robbed the bank. Joe is coming out of the saloon and Trager breaks Joe’s window and Joe is extremely mad. He runs after Trager and after a long fight, wins and brings Tragor in for bank robbery. Joe finds out that he gets a five hundred dollar reward for busting Tragor. It also seems that Trager’s real name is Cunningham, who also has a five hundred dollar reward on his head. 
Joe is walking to the saloon for another window and runs into Lily. Joe tells her about the robbery and Joe asks to see the ruby in her hand. She throws it to Joe and he drops in and it breaks it all over the ground. Ben comes over to see what Joe had broken now and sees it was the ruby. Joe says it was just a fake and wasn’t real. Ben tells Joe that Adam will want to see the ruby or whatever he paid for it, be it a fake or not. Joe and Ben greet Adam as he gets off the stage and Joe says he’ll pay one thousand dollars for the ruby. Adam says that a man on the stage offered fifteen hundred dollars so Joe asks for five hundred dollars from Hoss from winning the flapjack contest. Hoss declines to give the money to Joe and thinks it will be a good lesson for him. Ben agrees with Hoss as Joe goes off to get another window pane.
Quotes.
Lily: I’m not that kind of girl!
Joe: You’re no pie maker either, Jezebel. 
Ben: Oh I doubt that very much. As a matter of fact I’d being willing to make a little wager that you’re young brother here takes more than a year to pay you off.
Joe: Oh yeah, you giving any odds? 
"I'm starvin' to death after all that exercise. I can't live on this rabbit food!" - Hoss
Hoss: What are you doing down here, Joe?
Joe: It's too cold to sleep in my room with the window gone. What's your excuse?
Hoss: I came down here to get a drink of water.
Joe: A drink of water, my foot! You came down to sneak some food out of the kitchen, didn't you? Huh? Didn't you, Hoss? And you're sorry, aren't you? (Hoss shakes his head) Oh, no, you're not sorry.
Hoss: I'm hungry. I'm hungry, Joe, that's what I am. 
Hoss: What happens if I lose and Big Ed wins?
Joe: Don't talk that way. It makes me upset.

Oliver G. Traphagen House

The Oliver G. Traphagen House is a house in Duluth, Minnesota. The architect, Oliver G. Traphagen, designed a number of buildings in Duluth, as well as in Hawaii. The house is a three-story Victorian mansion. The front wall is built of local red sandstone and features ornate carving and window dressing, along with towers and unusual dormers. The three other faces of the building are faced in red brick. It was originally designed as a duplex house with two separate entrances and very similar floor plans on either side, with the exception of the front windows. The west side has curved windows, while the east side has straight windows with wood wainscoting underneath. There are ten fireplaces in the house, all but one of which retain their original tile. The house also has antique light fixtures in most of the rooms. These fixtures operated on either gas or electricity, because at the time, interior electric wiring was still new and not yet proven.
Chester Congdon lived in the house from 1897 through 1908 until their nearby mansion, Glensheen, was completed. In 1919, the house was subdivided into nine apartments. The house was purchased in 1986 by Howard Klatzky and is now home to an advertising firm.

Stand in the Schoolhouse Door

The Stand in the Schoolhouse Door took place at Foster Auditorium at the University of Alabama on June 11, 1963. George Wallace, the Governor of Alabama, in a symbolic attempt to keep his inaugural promise of "segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever" and stop the desegregation of schools, stood at the door of the auditorium to try to block the entry of two black students, Vivian Malone Jones and James Hood.
The incident brought George Wallace into the national spotlight.
Background.
On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court of the United States handed down its decision regarding the case called "Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas", in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional.
"Brown v. Board of Education" meant that the University of Alabama had to be desegregated. In the years following, hundreds of African-Americans applied for admission, but all were denied. The University worked with police to find any disqualifying qualities, or when this failed, intimidated the applicants. But in 1963, three African-Americans with perfect qualifications—Vivian Malone Jones, Dave McGlathery and James Hood—applied, refusing to be intimidated. In early June a federal district judge ordered that they be admitted, and forbade Governor Wallace from interfering.
The incident.
On June 11, Malone and Hood arrived to register. Wallace, attempting to uphold his promise as well as for political show, blocked the entrance to Foster Auditorium with the media watching. Then, flanked by federal marshals, Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach told Wallace to step aside. However, Wallace cut Katzenbach off and refused, giving a speech on States' rights. Katzenbach called President John F. Kennedy, who federalized the Alabama National Guard. General Henry Graham then commanded Wallace to step aside, saying, "Sir, it is my sad duty to ask you to step aside under the orders of the President of the United States." Wallace then spoke further, but eventually moved, and Malone and Hood registered as students.
In film.
The incident was detailed in Robert Drew's 1963 documentary film "". The event was depicted in the 1994 film "Forrest Gump", in which the title character appeared at the event, and in the 1997 television movie "George Wallace".

Skyland Trail

Skyland Trail is a private, not-for profit organization in Atlanta, Georgia offering treatment to adults with mental illness. Skyland Trail specializes in treating adults with Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia, Depression, and Dual Diagnosis.
History.
In the early 1980s, Charles B. West, an Atlanta businessman, saw a void in mental illness treatment. The dominant treatment model in Atlanta at the time was hospitalization for acute cases, aimed at stabilization. There was no long-term treatment program that provided therapies that included teaching skills needed to reintegrate patients back into the community.
Through a friend’s experience, West recognized the need, and in 1982, he established The George West Mental Health Foundation, named for his father, and recruited a board of directors. The board studied programs and innovations across the nation that looked beyond short-term stabilization and to long-term recovery.
Mission.
Skyland Trail promotes recovery from mental illness. Its programs foster reintegration into the community and empowers adults to live with dignity and independence. In partnership with families, providers and the community, Skyland Trail delivers treatment, education and research.
Programs.
Skyland Trail provides client-centered services for individuals with mental illness, grounded in personal commitment to recovery and engagement in the process. The client’s customized recovery plan includes primary medical care, psychiatric services, counseling and adjunctive therapies, which include horticultural, art. music and drama therapies. This approach integrates mental, physical and spiritual dimensions of health.
Day services are an element of every patient's recovery plan. All residential and intensive outpatient patients, participate in day services. Major components include group and individual counseling, psychiatric services and active therapies to engage patients in their recovery processes.
Patients participate in recovery communities, which are primary treatment systems with ten to fifteen clients each. Clients enter a recovery community based on their diagnosis. Community types are:
• Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): Major depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, psychotic illnesses 
• Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT): Secondary Axis II disorders, bipolar affective disorders, dual diagnosis 
• Dual Diagnosis: Secondary substance abuse with early, full remission; individuals who have recently relapsed 
• Young Adult: First break episodes of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders
• Longitudinal: Long-term clients who are relatively asymptomatic and focused on functional recovery and community reintegration
Treatment.
Skyland Trail provides active therapies that engage patients in their recovery process. Horticulture, art, music, drama and recreation provide regular activities and socialization opportunities to meet diverse patient interests and abilities, promoting increased self-esteem, socialization, community reintegration and a higher overall quality of life.
Skyland Trail was one of the first mental health treatment facilities in the U.S. to have an on-site, full-time primary care clinic. Patients receive primary medical care as part of a holistic treatment for mental illness connecting mental, emotional and physical health. 
Skyland Trail's evening Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) employs evidence-based treatments with client centered strategies to help adults who are working or in school continue progressing in their recovery.
Skyland Trail treats patients with a primary diagnosis of mental illness with related substance abuse disorders. Dual Diagnosis Services provide a structured program, individualized for the patient, to promote a drug-free and sober lifestyle. Group and individual psychotherapy help the patient gain insight into the relationship between his or her substance abuse and mental illness.
Research.
Skyland Trail's clinical team is working on the VALERO Study, a research initiative aimed at developing assessments to quantify and VALidate the Everyday, Real-life Outcomes of people with serious mental illness. The program, which is sponsored by the National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH) in conjunction with Emory University's Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, began in May 2008. Skyland Trail was one of two test sites selected nationally for the VALERO Study.

Mount Vernon Mill No. 3

Mount Vernon Mill No. 3 is a textile denim mill and is located in Trion, Georgia. Trion, which is a very small town in Chattooga County, runs off of Mount Vernon Mill No. 3. Mount Vernon pays about eighty percent of Trion's taxes. 
It is the largest employer in Chattooga County and has about 1700 employees. 
History.
Mount Vernon Mill No. 3 was the first cotton mill in northwest Georgia. Andrew P. Allgood, Spencer S. Marsh, and Col. W.K. Briers organized the Trion factory on October 12, 1845. In 1912, Benjamin D. Riegel became the new owner of the mill until his death in 1941. In 1913 there was a gym, library, apartments, theater, bowling alley and a hospital built in Trion. During World War 2 Mount Vernon Mill No. 3 produced enough fabric to make ten thousand, five hundred fatigue suits and over seven and a half billion yards for gun patches. In 1971 many different machines where installed to produce denim. Benjamin Riegel's daughter decided to sell her stock to Robert B. Pamplin in 1985 because she thought that he could take care of the company and town like her father did. On February 16, 1990 a flood came and almost ruined the machines but after ten days the mill was running again.
Today.
Today the mill has over one million square feet of manufacturing space and produces over two million pounds of cotton and denim each week. The denim is shipped to different locations in the United States and to foreign countries each week.

Insnab

Insnab (a combination from the Russian "INostranets" (foreigner) and "SNABzheniie" (provision)) was a Soviet state organization responsible for the provision of foreign specialists and workers employed in the Soviet industry with food and commodities. It was established in 1932 with the aim to reduce the impact of food shortages on foreign communities. Within the system of food rationing introduced in the early 1930s, foreign specialists and workers were one of the most privileged group in the USSR. For example, in 1932, American and Canadian specialists employed in the Soviet Karelia were provided with basic foodstuffs according to the following monthly norms:<br>

Salvia regla

Salvia regla (Mountain sage) is a deciduous perennial that is native to a small area of the Chisos Mountains in west Texas and a large area of Mexico, in the states of Coahuila, Durango, and Oaxaca. The specific epithet is probably from the town of Regla in the state of Hidalgo. It is also referred to as the "queen of the Chisos Mountains". It has been widely planted along the Texas flyway for migrating birds, and is an important food source for hummingbirds returning to the tropics in September and October.
"Salvia regla" is a deciduous shrub which reaches up to 6 feet tall and 4-5 feet wide. It grows on upright stems which give it a stately appearance. The mistletoe-green deltoid leaves are deeply veined and about 1 inch wide and long. The flower tube is 1 inch long, with a signal-red 1 inch calyx that is turned to the light, and is chartreuse on the underside. Though it was introduced into horticulture in 1839, it was very uncommon until the 1980s. Nurseries sell several cultivars, including 'Royal', 'Mount Emory', and 'Warnock's Choice'.

Kerri Hanks

Kerri Michel Hanks (born September 2, 1985, in Plano, Texas) is an American soccer forward who last played for Sky Blue FC of Women's Professional Soccer. She is currently an assistant coach for the Texas Christian University women's soccer team.
Hanks was a forward for the University of Notre Dame women's soccer team from 2005 to 2008, and is one of the most highly decorated players in the history of women's college soccer. She is the fourth player in women's college soccer to win the Hermann Trophy twice, joining Mia Hamm, Cindy Parlow, and Christine Sinclair in sharing that honor.
Early life.
Notre Dame Fighting Irish.
Hanks' first year playing for the Irish was in 2005; she held off enrolling at Notre Dame in order to participate in the 2004 FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship in Thailand. Hanks scored 28 goals as a freshman, becoming the third-highest scorer in women's college soccer for that year. Hanks is just one of 23 players ever in Division I women’s soccer history to earn All-America accolades all four season and the youngest recipient by class year of the Hermann Trophy, which is presented to the top female and male soccer player in NCAA Division I soccer. Much of Hanks' success came under the mentorship of Notre Dame teammate and Canadian international Katie Thorlakson, with whom Hanks shares the NCAA record in career assists. During Hanks' second season with the Irish she led the nation in goals and assists. Hanks became the youngest recipient, male or female, of the prestigious Hermann Trophy in 2006, selected ahead of the other two finalists, North Carolina's Heather O'Reilly and Yael Averbuch. 2007 was a relatively quiet year for Hanks, despite scoring 14 goals and posting 21 assists for the Irish and making it to the semifinals of the 2007 College Cup, in which Hanks assisted on Carrie Dew's goal in the first half. However, the Irish were defeated, 2-3, by Florida State, who would then go on to lose 0-2 in the final to USC, the eventual NCAA champion. 
Having finished her bachelor's degree in sociology the spring before her NCAA eligibility ended, Hanks debated over whether to continue playing for the Irish, or end her college career. Hanks decided to take one last chance at an NCAA championship title in 2008, scoring 20 goals and receiving the Lowe's Senior CLASS Award. Notre Dame was the top-ranked team in 2008 heading into the 2008 College Cup, defeating Stanford in the semifinal, 1-0, on a goal by Courtney Barg. During the championship game, Hanks scored the fastest goal in the history of the College Cup Final, 16 seconds after the game had started. Winning the championship, however, was not to be; North Carolina responded to Hanks' goal with two goals from Casey Nogueira, and the Irish fell to the Tar Heels, 1-2.
Despite that loss, Hanks would receive the Hermann Trophy for the second time, over Nogueira and UCLA's Christina DiMartino. Hanks ended her career at Notre Dame with 84 goals, 73 assists, and 241 points, joining Mia Hamm and Jenny Streiffer as only the third person to reach 70 goals and 70 assists in her college career. Hanks 241 points are the most in school history.
Playing career.
Club.
Hanks was selected sixth overall in the 2009 Women's Professional Soccer draft, going to the Saint Louis Athletica in the first round. Halfway through the 2009 season, on June 26, 2009, Hanks was traded to Sky Blue FC and helped lead the team to the 2009 WPS Championship. 
During the 2010 WPS preseason, Sky Blue FC waived Hanks on March 10, 2010; that same day, she was picked up by the Philadelphia Independence. Six days later, on March 16, Hanks left the Independence and joined the Atlanta Beat preseason camp. Atlanta released Hanks on March 26, choosing to keep an extra defender instead. 
In early April, Hanks resurfaced at tryouts for Icelandic club Stjarnan F.C. in Portugal.
International.
Hanks was a member of the United States U-19 national soccer team that participated in the 2002 FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship in Canada; she was one of the youngest players on that squad, which won the inaugural championship title. She would return to the U-19s to play in the 2004 FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship in Thailand, where the United States finished third. Hanks is currently ranked second behind Ashlyn Harris in all-time appearances (30) for the U-20 national team, as well as third all-time in goals scored (22) for the U-20s, behind Kelly Wilson and current national team star Lindsay Tarpley.
Hanks competed for the United States U-23 women's national soccer team in 2008, playing in the 2008 Nordic Cup and appearing in all four matches of the tournament.
Coaching.
In August 2010, Hanks joined the Texas Christian University women's soccer coaching staff. In addition to her TCU duties, Hanks also coaches the Sting West Silver team of Fort Worth. In 2012, Hanks left the TCU soccer program, and will be relocating to Florida with husband Nic Petersen.
Personal.
On July 28, 2012, Hanks married Nic Petersen, Assistant Coach for Jumps at the University of Florida Track program.

AgcXML

agcXML is a set of extensible Markup Language (XML) schemas designed to automate and streamline the exchange of information during the building design and construction process. agcXML facilitates the electronic exchange of typical business information between different programs that would otherwise be exchanged in unstructured construction documents.
Current state.
As of February 2014, AGC re-focused on starting the schema development and adoption phase. AGC engaged the Burger Consulting Group(BCG)in Chicago to manage this process. To encourage collaboration with AGC and BCG, an Advisory Board composed of software vendors, contractors and AGC’s IT Forum Steering committee members that work to determine and verify the direction of the agcXML PMO.
In October 2013, revisions to the existing schema Request for Information (RFI) and Change Order Directive began. The revisions to the alpha schema were completed on March 4, 2014 and a live RFI transaction demonstration was held at AGC's National Convention. The demonstration was a resounding success and the schema will now go onto the public review period. Progress still continues on the Change Order Directive with a public review period expected in May 2014.
Advisory Board members.
Advisory Board members included: 
agcXML Industry Steward.
In early 2013, AGC engaged Burger Consulting Group (BCG) as the agcXML Industry Steward for the agcXML initiative. In this capacity, BCG will, in coordination with AGC, act as the Project Management Office (PMO) working with contractors and construction software developers to accomplish easy data exchange and integrated systems using agcXML schema.
In this role, BCG is responsible for driving this initiative forward in a timely manner. They will be involved in all aspects of this project and will specifically provide guidance to both the agcXML Advisory Board and Application Workgroups, establish and clarify responsibilities for each group, track the project’s progress to ensure its success, facilitate open and clear communications between all parties both internally and externally and ensure the project stays within budget.
Since 1994, BCG has been the premier provider of information technology and information systems management consulting to construction companies. Deeply experienced in the construction industry and familiar with the range of software applications in this sector, BCG remains completely vendor-independent making them an excellent choice as agcXML Industry Steward.
History.
The agcXML Project was an industry-wide initiative funded and led by the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC) and managed, under a contract with AGC, by the National Institute of Building Sciences. The goal of the project was to enable the efficient and reliable exchange of electronic construction project information among all building design and construction professionals. While building information modeling (BIM) is designed to facilitate the electronic exchange and the effective use of information about a building facility throughout the life cycle of a building facility, the agcXML Project focuses on transactional data—which may or may not be “building information”—that architects, engineers, contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers, and building owners typically exchange during the building design and construction process. Most of this information is still commonly exchanged in paper documents (or electronic equivalents of paper documents) such as owner/contractor agreements, schedules of values, requests for information (RFIs), requests for proposals (RFPs), architect/engineer supplemental instructions, change orders, change directives, submittals, applications for payment, and addenda, to name a few.
The project resulted in a set of extensible markup language (XML) schemas that will enable design and construction professionals to reliably exchange project information among dissimilar and proprietary software applications, without requiring the reengineering or redesign of those applications. The agcXML schemas established a common, non-proprietary data format and classification system. Software developers will be able to modify their applications with minimal effort to import and export data in agcXML format, without having to change or even share their proprietary software code and data formats. The schemas will remain the property of AGC, will be made publicly available and will be licensed at no cost and in perpetuity to any party for any legitimate purpose in support of the exchange of agcXML data. The project is coordinated with other data format standards development efforts worldwide to ensure the compatibility of agcXML data with those efforts.

Derek Holland

Derek Lane Holland (born October 9, 1986) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball. He is noted for his kid-like appearance and fun-loving behavior. He was the no. 2 rated prospect in the organization according to "Baseball America", behind Neftalí Feliz, for 2009. He is nicknamed the Dutch Oven.
Professional career.
Pitching style.
Holland has the ability to throw a variety of pitches to right-handed hitters and left-handed hitters at different speeds. His primary pitch is a four-seam fastball averaging 94-95 mph. To lefties, he throws the four-seamer, a two-seamer, and a slider (82-85). To righties, he throws a balance of the aforementioned pitches as well as a changeup in the mid 80s and a curveball in the mid-high 70s. Holland relies heavily on his slider with two strikes to both right-handed and left-handed hitters.
Texas Rangers (2009-present).
2009: Debut Year.
Holland was drafted in the 25th round in 2006 out of Wallace State Community College in Hanceville, Alabama, a member of the National Junior College Athletic Association. 
On April 22, 2009, Holland made his major league debut; pitching 2⅓ innings, allowing 3 hits, no runs, no walks, and striking out 2. On August 9, he pitched his first complete game, a 7–0 shutout against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in Anaheim. For the 2009 season, Holland finished the season 8-13 with a 6.12 ERA in 33 games (21 starts).
2010.
Holland spent the majority of 2010 in Triple-A Oklahoma City, and was called up only due to injuries to other starters. After winning his first two decisions, he lost his next three. He ended the regular season with a 3–4 record, and 4.08 ERA.
Holland allowed 3 runs in 4.2 innings in the ALDS against the Tampa Bay Rays. He pitched 5.2 innings in the ALCS with no earned runs, and was crucial in Game 4, earning the victory against the defending champion New York Yankees. He came in in the fourth inning with one out and the bases loaded, and got his team out of a serious jam while also eating away innings to protect his bullpen.
Unfortunately, Holland would not have the same success in the World Series against the San Francisco Giants. In game 2, Holland entered with one on and one out in the bottom of the 8th inning, with the Rangers trailing 2-0. Seemingly unable to handle the pressure of pitching in the World Series for the first time, Holland walked all three batters he faced, without recording an out, and forced in the runner he inherited via his final walk. Holland's wildness would open the door for what turned into a huge inning for the eventual champion Giants, as all three of the batters he walked would come around to score. The Rangers would lose the game 9-0. Holland did pitch a scoreless relief inning in a game four 4-0 loss, but he and the Rangers would lose the series 4-1.
2011.
Holland started the 2011 season as a starter for the Rangers, and despite a 4.96 ERA, won four of his five starts in April and May. He lowered his ERA to 4.14 in June, mainly by virtue of his first shutout of the season. He started off July with inconsistency, failing to make it out of the first inning against the Marlins. Over the next five starts, he would respond by throwing three more shutouts.
In 2011, he was 16–5 with a 3.95 ERA. He led the AL in shutouts (4; tied for fifth-most in Rangers history), was 3rd in win-loss percentage (.762; the fifth-best in Rangers history), and was 4th in wins. 
On October 23, Holland was the winning pitcher in Game 4 of the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, giving up no runs on two hits, two walks and striking out seven. He was pulled from the game after pitching 8 and 1/3 innings. The Rangers lost the World Series after 7 games.
2012.
He signed a contract extension on March 20, 2012 that is worth $28.5 million over 5 years with a two year club option with Texas Rangers. Holland finished the regular season with a win-loss record of 12-7 with an ERA of 4.67 as he gave up 32 home runs, fifth highest in Major League Baseball.
2013.
In 2013, Holland went 10-9 with a 3.42 ERA in 33 starts.
2014.
On January 7, 2014, Holland suffered a knee injury after a fall while playing with his dog at home. MRIs tested positive that Holland had torn cartilage in his left knee. Holland underwent arthroscopic microfracture surgery to repair the cartilage damage on January 10, 2014. In the aftermath of the surgery, Holland started the 2014 season on the 60-day disabled list being sidelined until at least the All-Star break.

Reedville Creek Park

Reedville Creek Park is a municipal park in the Reedville neighborhood of Hillsboro, Oregon, United States. Opened in 2003, the park is along Cornelius Pass Road at Francis Street in the southeast area of the city. The park includes basketball courts, children’s play equipment, a picnic shelter, tennis courts, and sports fields among other amenities. Reedville Creek was the first and is the only park in Hillsboro with a skatepark.
History.
In 1999, Hillsboro bought a parcel for park to be built at Cornelius Pass Road and Francis Street. The land, which abuts Reedville Creek, was a filbert orchard when the city made the purchase. That same year the city announced plans to build a city owned skatepark at a then undetermined location. In 2001, the parks department finalized plans for the park, which included parking, basketball courts, sports fields, tennis courts, play equipment, and the skatepark.
In March of the following year the city solicited input from residents on the design of what was then planned to be a skatepark. At that time the name of Reedville Creek Park had been adopted. Prior to committing to a skateboard facility, the city waited to build one to ensure skateboarding and inline skating were not merely fads. Early plans estimated the cost of the structure to total approximately $100,000 for the outdoor skatepark that was to be designed to accommodate beginner and intermediate levels of ability.
During the skatepark design process, the city received over 100 suggestions from residents, primarily from teenagers. The process resulted in plans for a skatepark that featured primarily street elements such as steps and rails that skateboarders would normally find in urban settings. Mike McIntyre and his SITE Design Group were hired by the city to design the skatepark, which had then grown to a plan and a cost of $200,000 to $300,000. The city put the construction out for bid on the entire park in May 2002, with estimates for the total cost of the park reaching as high as $1.5 million.
The city hired Corp Inc. for $1.54 million to build Reedville Creek Park in June 2002, with construction beginning that month. Hillsboro estimated the park would be completed by the end of the year. By mid-November the concrete ramps at the park had been installed. In February 2003, the park and skatepark opened. Funds to pay for the park were collected from the city’s development charges.
The opening of the park attracted skateboarders from around the Portland metropolitan area. The skatepark was the first one in a Hillsboro park. That summer the city built a fence between the basketball courts and the skatepark. Since opening the park has hosted events such as a safety fair in 2004, annual skateboarding camps, a tennis camp held by the National Junior Tennis League in 2007, and a park clean-up event organized by SOLV that included removal of non-native species from Reedville Creek held in May 2008.
When the skatepark at Reedville Creek opened, only skateboarders were allowed to use the skatepark. In June 2010, the city started a 90 day trial period where people riding bicycles and scooters would be allowed to use the skatepark as well. Hillsboro made the change permanent in October of that year.
Amenities.
Reedville Creek Park features areas for a variety of sports related activities as well as traditional park amenities. The park has two basketball courts, two tennis courts, a softball field, and a soccer field. There is also a skatepark along the eastern edge of the park built of concrete which is also lighted. Other facilities include a picnic shelter, children’s playground equipment, paths, and public restrooms. The park has a parking lot that can hold up to 40 cars. There is also a memorial at the park to Paul Grillo who was killed by his brother while the two were in college at the University of Oregon.

<doc id="21612736" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21612736" title="Commentaries on Aristotle">
Commentaries on Aristotle

Commentaries on Aristotle refers to the great mass of literature produced, especially in the ancient and medieval world, to explain and clarify the works of Aristotle. The pupils of Aristotle were the first to comment on his writings, a tradition which was continued by the Peripatetic school throughout the Hellenistic period and the Roman era. The Neoplatonists of the late Roman empire wrote many commentaries on Aristotle, attempting to incorporate him into their philosophy. Although Ancient Greek commentaries are considered the most useful, commentaries continued to be written by the Christian scholars of the Byzantine Empire, and by the many Islamic philosophers and Western scholastics who had inherited his texts.
Greek commentators.
The first pupils of Aristotle commentated on his writings, but often with a view to expand his work. Thus Theophrastus invented five moods of syllogism in the first figure, in addition to the four invented by Aristotle, and stated with additional accuracy the rules of hypothetical syllogisms. He also often differed with his master, including in collecting much information concerning animals and natural events, which Aristotle had omitted.
During the early Roman empire we find few celebrated names among the Peripatetic philosophers. Nicolaus of Damascus wrote several treatises on the philosophy of Aristotle; and Alexander of Aegae also wrote commentaries on Aristotle. The earliest commentaries which survive, are those written in the 2nd century by Adrastus and Aspasius. Alexander of Aphrodisias (c. 200) was regarded by subsequent Aristotelians among the Greeks, Latins, and Muslims, as the best interpreter of Aristotle. On account of the number and value of his commentaries, he was called, by way of distinction, "The Commentator". Several of his works are still extant, among which is a treatise "On Fate", wherein he supports the doctrine of divine providence.
Many of the Neoplatonists undertook to explain and illustrate the writings of Aristotle, particularly on the subject of dialectics, which Plato had left imperfect. Porphyry (3rd century) wrote a book on the "Categories", which was found to be so suitable a complement to the "Categories" of Aristotle, that it was usually prefixed to that treatise. Porphyry sought to show that Plato and Aristotle were in harmony with each other, especially in regards to the compatibility of Aristotle's Categories with Plato's Theory of Forms. Porphyry's pupil Iamblichus continued this process of harmonising Plato and Aristotle, and Dexippus, a disciple of Iamblichus, wrote a "Reply to the Objections of Plotinus against Aristotle's Categories", which is still extant. Themistius (4th century), who taught at Constantinople with great success, paraphrased several of the works of Aristotle, particularly the "Posterior Analytics", the "Physics", and the book "On the Soul". In the 5th century, Ammonius Hermiae represented Plato and Aristotle in agreeing that god was the artificier of a beginningless universe. Olympiodorus, an Alexandrian philosopher, wrote commentaries upon Aristotle's "Meteorology" and "Categories". Simplicius of Cilicia (6th century) wrote extensive commentaries upon Aristotle, and, like many of the other Neoplatonists, attempted to reconcile the doctrines of the Pythagoreans, of the Eleatics, of Plato, and of the Stoics, with those of Aristotle. He also strenuously defended Aristotle's doctrine concerning the eternity of the world.
In the 6th century, Boethius, whose commentaries on the logical works of Aristotle became the only commentaries in Latin available to the West, entertained the design of translating into Latin the whole of Aristotle's and Plato's works, and of showing their agreement; a gigantic plan, which he never executed. Others employed themselves in disentangling the confusion which such attempts produced, as John Philoponus, who, in the sixth century, maintained that Aristotle was entirely misunderstood by Porphyry and Proclus in incorporating his doctrines into those of the Neoplatonists, or even in reconciling him with Plato himself on the subject of ideas, offering instead a Christian interpretation of the Aristotelian corpus. Others, again, wrote epitomes, compounds, abstracts; and tried to throw the works of Aristotle into some simpler and more obviously regular form, as John of Damascus, in the middle of the 8th century, who made abstracts of some of Aristotle's works, and introduced the study of the author into theological education. John of Damascus lived under the patronage of the Arabs, and was at first secretary to the Caliph, but afterwards withdrew to a monastery.
Islamic commentators.
In the 9th century, the Platonising school of Thābit ibn Qurra in Baghdad translated Aristotle and his commentators into Arabic. Islamic scholars made a point of studying the writings of Aristotle, especially his metaphysical and logical writings, and also of his "Physics". They wrote commentaries on Aristotle, and developed still further the abstract logical element. Many of these commentaries are still extant.
Al-Kindi, who wrote a commentary on Aristotelian logic, lived in the 9th century, under Al-Ma'mun. Al-Farabi (10th century) wrote commentaries on Aristotle's "Organon", which were made diligent use of by the Scholastics. It is related of him that he read through Aristotle's treatise "On Hearing" forty times, and his "Rhetoric" two hundred times, without getting at all tired of them. The physicians made a study of philosophy, and formulated theories; among them was Avicenna (c. 980-1037), who came from Bukhara, to the east of the Caspian Sea; he wrote a commentary on Aristotle. Al-Ghazali (1058–1111) wrote compendiums of logic and metaphysics. Averroes (1126–1198) was especially distinguished as a commentator of Aristotle. He often wrote two or three different commentaries on the same work, and some 38 commentaries by Averroes on the works of Aristotle have been identified. Although his writings had only marginal impact in Islamic countries, his works had a huge impact in the Latin West following the Latin translations of the 12th and 13th centuries.
Byzantine commentators.
The line of the Aristotelian commentators was continued to the later ages of the Byzantine Empire. In the 12th century Anna Comnena organised a group of scholars which included the commentators Michael of Ephesus, and Eustratius of Nicaea who employed himself upon the dialectic and moral treatises, and whom she does not hesitate to elevate above the Stoics and Platonists for his talent in philosophical discussions. Nicephorus Blemmydes wrote logical and physical epitomes for the use of John Ducas; George Pachymeres composed an epitome of the philosophy of Aristotle, and a compendium of his logic: Theodore Metochites, who was famous in his time for his eloquence and his learning, has left a paraphrase of the books of Aristotle on "Physics", "On the Soul", "On the Heavens", etc. The same period saw the commentaries and paraphrases of Sophonias.
Commentators in the Latin West.
Scholastic philosophy in the Latin West was decisively shaped when the works of Aristotle became widely available, at first through translations of commentators and their basis texts from Arabic, and later through translations from Greek of Aristotle's original text (notably by William of Moerbeke) and of the Greek commentators. Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, and William of Ockham, among many others, wrote important philosophical works in the form of Aristotelian commentaries.
Lists and indices of commentaries on Aristotle.

Henry IV the Faithful

Henry IV (II) the Faithful ( – 22 January 1342) was a Duke of Żagań and parts of Greater Poland from 1309 until 1317 (with his brothers in all the lands except Głogów in different divisions among them), Duke of Głogów from 1318 until 1321 (with his brother as co-ruler) and sole ruler over Żagań from 1321 until his death.
He was the oldest son of Henry III (I), Duke of Głogów, by his wife Matilda, daughter of Albert I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg. The nickname of "Faithful" ("Wierny") only was given to him in the 14th century chronicles.
Life.
Henry III prepared his eldest son in political affairs from his early years. In 1296 he took the four-years-old Henry with him to peace negotiations with the Duke Władysław I the Elbow-high of Kuyavia in Krzywin. The young prince Henry had an important part in this meeting: Władysław I designated him his heir over the Duchy of Poznań in case he died without male issue; in addition, the Duke of Kuyavia was also forced to secure the succession of Henry III's descendants over all the Duchy of Głogów. However, this agreement was dismissed when Władysław I began to have sons, and in this way, the chances of inheritance of Henry IV over Poznań were small.
Henry III died on 9 December 1309 and Henry IV succeeded him over all his lands except Głogów, which was taken by his mother Matilda as her "Oprawa wdowia". Although he was seventeen years old, an age considered enough to rule alone according to the Piast dynasty customs, for unknown reasons, he remained, with his immediate younger brother Konrad, under the regency of their mother until 1312.
In 1312 Henry IV made the first division of the Duchy: the eastern part, consisting of the towns of Oleśnica, Kluczbork, Kalisz and Gniezno was given to his younger brothers Konrad and Bolesław. Henry IV and his youngest brothers Jan and Przemko II retained Ścinawa, Żagań and Greater Poland.
The situation of the Dukes of Głogów was difficult from the beginning of their rule, mostly because of the revived pretentions of Władysław I the Elbow-high over all Greater Poland and the inheritance of Henry IV Probus. For this reason, they decided to establish good relations with the Margraves of Brandenburg as a counterweight against their enemies; as a guarantee of these good relations, Henry IV married the daughter of the Margrave Herman, Matilda, in 1310. In the marriage contract the towns of Krosno Odrzańskie and Żagań were also pledged to the Margraviate, remaining in the hands of Brandenburg until 1319, when they came back to Henry III's sons. Thanks to this alliance with the House of Ascania Henry IV, along with younger brothers Konrad and Bolesław renounced in Berlin on 3 March 1310 their claims over Gdańsk Pomerania to the Margraves Waldemar of Brandenburg-Stendal and John V of Brandenburg-Salzwedel, who soon sold them for a large sum of money to the Teutonic Knights.
In Greater Poland, the dissatisfaction against the government of Henry III's sons erupted in a revolt, which occurred in 1310. Henry IV suffered an unexpected defeat at the hands of insurgents in Klecki, but he managed to maintain his rule. The situation worsened two years later, when the Dukes of Głogów were excommunicated by the of Archbishop of Gniezno, Jakub Świnka and the Bishop of Poznań, Andrzej Zaremba. However, Władysław I the Elbow-high was only involved directly in the conflict in 1313, and could successfully take control over almost all Greater Poland one year later. Henry IV and his brothers only retained a fraction of the Greater Poland lands near the Obra River, which was ultimately lost in 1332 (with the exception of Wschowa, which was lost by Henry V of Iron). The sons of Henry III, after several attempts in the diplomatic sphere, and even with military invasions, tried to recover Greater Poland without success. To this end, they were involved in a series of unfavorable treaties with the Margraves of Brandenburg, hoping for their military support. Fortunately them, all these agreements were annulled after the extinction of the House of Ascania in its Brandenburg branch in 1320.
Also, the alliance with the Dukes of Legnica proved to be totally inadequate. The war of 1312–1317 was finally ended with the settlement of 8 January 1317, by which the Dukes of Głogów were forced to cede the territory between the Oder River and Wołów, with Uraz and Lubiąż.
After the death of their mother Matilda in 1318, Głogów was inherited by Henry IV and his brother Przemko II. Three years later, in 1321, the final territorial division was made between them: Przemko II received Głogów as sole ruler, Henry IV obtained Żagań and Jan obtained Ścinawa and Lubin. The other brothers, Konrad and Bolesław, retained Oleśnica and Namysłów.
In 1322 the sons of Henry III joined the coalition of the Silesian Dukes (Bernard II of Świdnica, Henry VI the Good, Bolesław III the Generous), whose head was Władysław I the Elbow-high, now King of Poland. This action weakened even more the power of the Dukes of Głogów, who at the end also lost Namysłów.
One year later, in order to avoid the intervention of Emperor Louis IV, Henry IV put his Duchy under the protection of the Holy See. On 29 July 1326 Henry IV concluded a treaty with his brothers Jan of Ścinawa and Przemko II of Głogów, according to which if one of them died without male issue, the other two inherited his land. It seems that it was an attempt to restore the unity of the Duchy of Głogów.
After 1327 the political situation in Silesia was to change greatly. John of Luxemburg, King of Bohemia, began his direct interference over Upper Silesia. In 1329 he forced Henry IV, Bolesław III the Generous, Jan of Ścinawa and Konrad I of Oleśnica to became his vassals. From the sons of Henry III, only Przemko II of Głogów refused to accept the overlordship of the Bohemian King. With the support of King John, Henry IV tried unsuccessfully to claim the succession of the House of Ascania over Brandenburg.
In 1331 Przemko II of Głogów died without issue, poisoned by one of his vassals. According to the agreement previously concluded, his Duchy was divided between Henry IV and Jan of Ścinawa. Przemko II's widow only retained the main city of Głogów and Bytom Odrzański. King John of Bohemia, however, had other plans; shortly after, he invaded the Duchy, depriving the widow and brothers of their inheritance. In order to validate this action, the King purchased from Jan of Ścinawa his rights over the half of Głogów for 2,000 fines. King John's conduct infringed the rights of Przemko II's widow and Henry IV, who never could retake Głogów.
In order to prevent Jan from selling his Duchy of Ścinawa to Bohemia, on 25 July 1334 Henry IV and Konrad I entered into an arrangement with him, under which Jan was forbidden to sell any part of Ścinawa without the consent of his brothers. Finally, years later the brothers bought Jan his Duchy, which was returned to him only during his life. On 30 April 1341 Henry IV received from his brother Jan the town of Wschowa.
Henry IV died on 22 January 1342 in Żagan, and was buried in the local Augustinian church.
Marriage and issue.
By 5 January 1310, Henry IV married Matilda (b. ca. 1296 – d. ca. 31 March 1329), daughter of Herman, Margrave of Brandenburg-Salzwedel. They had four children:

Ventus (Kingdom Hearts)

, commonly referred to as , is a fictional character from Square Enix's video game franchise "Kingdom Hearts". Having first made cameos in "Kingdom Hearts II" and other related titles, Ventus was introduced in the 2010 prequel "Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep" as one of the three protagonists. In its story, Ventus is introduced as the youngest apprentice of Master Eraqus who trains him alongside his best friends, Terra and Aqua, to become experienced warriors with the Keyblade. When Terra goes on a mission to find Master Xehanort, Ventus follows him, having also become concerned about his fate. As Ventus journeys through various worlds, he learns about his origins as well as his relation with Xehanort and his apprentice Vanitas.
Ventus was designed by director Tetsuya Nomura who wanted to create a character with an important connection with the series' main character Sora. Ventus bears a strong resemblance to the character of Roxas, both of whom are voiced by Kōki Uchiyama in Japanese and Jesse McCartney in English. After Ventus' first cameo, Nomura had to state that both of them are different characters, and the reason for such connection would be revealed in "Birth by Sleep". Video game websites also commented on Ventus' first appearance, initially confusing him for Roxas during the development of "Birth by Sleep", but has since been well received.
Appearances.
Before being introduced in "Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep", Ventus first made cameos in the secret endings of "Kingdom Hearts II" and its re-release, "Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix", which depicted him and his friends Terra and Aqua battling Master Xehanort and Vanitas. Ventus is also shown in a cameo in "Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days" when Xion, a replica of Sora, appears as Ventus while fighting Xigbar from Organization XIII. Ventus is also constantly referenced by Xigbar in "Kingdom Hearts II" and "358/2 Days" while Xemnas, the Nobody of Xehanort, is in search of him in Castle Oblivion. 
Prior to the start of "Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep", Ventus was the apprentice of Master Xehanort, who trained him to complete the legendary χ-blade (pronounced as "key blade"). However, due to Ventus' reluctance to use darkness, Xehanort extracted it from his heart, resulting in the creation of Vanitas, but also leaving his heart incomplete and on the verge of collapse. He is brought by Xehanort to Destiny Islands, where his heart merges with that of the newborn Sora to keep it safe. Having lost his memories, Ventus is placed in the care of Master Eraqus as his youngest Keyblade apprentice alongside Terra and Aqua. At the games beginning, Vanitas taunts Ventus into following Terra who is on a quest to find Xehanort. Ventus travels through various worlds, fighting mysterious creatures called the Unversed and meeting various people. Vanitas attacks Ventus during his journey to test his strength, but he is defeated when Ventus is aided by the Keyblade apprentice Mickey. Upon meeting Xehanort, Ventus is forced to remember his purpose as being used to create the χ-blade. Ventus refuses to battle Vanitas to avoid creating the χ-blade, but is forced to after Vanitas threatens to kill Terra and Aqua if he does refuses. They battle within the Keyblade Graveyard, where Vanitas merges with Ventus and obtains the χ-blade. However, this fusion is incomplete, which allows Ventus to destroy Vanitas within his heart and Aqua to destroy the χ-blade. As a result, Ventus loses his heart and his body is placed within Castle Oblivion by Aqua until he awakens. Ventus' wandering heart is able to find its way back to the young Sora, who accepts Ventus' heart into his body. In the game's secret ending, he is seen in the Land of Departure with Terra, and the two utter Sora's name with newfound hope.
Ventus is mentioned in the secret ending of ', when Mickey reveals he has learned where Ventus' heart is, having searched for his whereabouts for the past ten years. In ', Sora briefly takes the form of Ventus during a dream, and when his heart is wounded, Ventus' armor appears to protect his body. In the ending of the game, Ventus is shown in Castle Oblivion, still in his catatonic state, his face drawn into a smile.
Creation and development.
When first designing Ventus, Tetsuya Nomura already decided the character should look like Sora or Roxas, and decided to choose the latter when thinking that Vanitas being revealed to have Sora's appearance would give a big impact to the gamers. Nomura wanted Ventus' personality to more closely resemble Sora's, which led to his outgoing personality, yet at the same time he wanted him to become more serious as the game progressed to make them distinct. Ventus was first shown in the secret endings of "Kingdom Hearts II" and its rerelease "Kingdom Hearts II: Final Mix". Ventus' name first appeared as a code in a 2006 Tokyo Game Show promotional video of the games. While making "Final Mix"s ending, Nomura had only developed the backstory for Terra, Aqua and Ventus and not their appearances, but had to finish their design for the end of game cameo. Nomura did not reveal their identities, and only stated that the three character were from the chronological past of the "Kingdom Hearts" series. Following their release, Nomura stated that his nickname was Ven. Ventus was first mentioned by the character Lingering Sentiment in "Final Mix" as Ven, while his full name was still unrevealed. He also mentioned a connection between him and Xemnas but wanted to leave it up to people's imaginations as he still could not reveal his identity. 
Nomura commented that, despite how similar they are, Roxas and Ventus are not the same character. Additionally, he stated that by playing "Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep", players will be able to distinguish Roxas from Ventus and that the game explores his true personality. In another interview, Nomura implied both characters are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such connection. The guidebook "Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Ultimania" clarified the connection, stating that Roxas and Ventus look alike because Ventus' heart entered Sora's body and Roxas' birth allowed Ventus' heart to reside in Roxas. In early versions of development, Nomura planned to have Ventus' broken heart be healed by the heart of Sora before he was born, but after negative feedback from overseas coworkers it was abandoned. Like Roxas, Ventus has been voiced Kōki Uchiyama in Japanese and Jesse McCartney in English.
Ventus' name means "wind" in Latin; both it and his Keyblade are called Wayward Wind, known in Japan as , and have a "sky" theme similar to that of Sora's. During development of "Birth by Sleep", the Osaka team in charge of developing the game suggested that Ventus should be related with Vanitas, something which Nomura liked as he wanted to add more connections within the story, so Vanitas' name was made to sound similar to Ventus' name. Nomura had trouble designing the armor for Ventus, Terra and Aqua since the gameplay mechanism for activating their armor had not been fleshed out. Therefore, an "X" was added to their clothes as a way to activate the armors as well as due to the fact it was one of the game's keywords. Ever since development of "Birth by Sleep" started, the staff already decided that Ventus', Aqua's and Terra's stories would be told in separate scenarios, with Ventus' story being the second one written. They also wanted emphasize the lack of coincidences in the series, leading to the interaction between the three scenarios. In gameplay perspective, Ventus was designed to be the easiest character to play with in "Birth by Sleep", although Nomura recommended to players that Ventus should be the second character to play with in order to understand the story better. Additionally, the way Ventus handles his Keyblade backwards is meant to show the gameplay differences between his and Terra's and Aqua's scenarios. Nomura also remarked Ventus' encounter with the characters Lea and Isa as an important event from the game, hoping both newcomers and older gamers will also find it important from Ventus' perspective.
Reception.
Due to his resemblance with Roxas, video game publications initially thought that Roxas would be one of the protagonists from "Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep" when seeing one of Ventus' mages. However, when it was revealed that the two were different, publications continued to discuss how similar they were and if there was a connection between them. GamesRadar particularly thought that there would be an eventual connection between the two of them and Sora. Amanda L. Kondolojy from Cheat Code Central also commented on speculations regarding the similarities between both of them, but mentioned that due to the existence of Nobodies in series, it is hard to find them as coincidences. When Jesse McCartney confirmed he was working on the English localization of "Birth by Sleep", sites thought that he would voice Ventus, as he also voiced Roxas in previous titles. The character's story and actions shown in the demonstrations were praised for being the "most original take on Kingdom Hearts" and yet "frustratingly traditional". Upon Ventus' introduction in "Birth by Sleep", X-Play found the character to be very similar to Sora's due to his friendly attitude. Kevin VanOrd from the same site gave praise to Ventus' character for his "well-meaning" and yet not "annoying" personality. The site also said that the time players spend playing with Ventus would be "rewarding" and commented on the English voice acting. PlayStation LifeStyle's Thomas Williams found the trio of Ventus, Terra and Aqua as welcome additions to the franchise, finding their stories enjoyable even though the three travel to the same worlds. On the other hand, PALGN found the three characters unappealing, labelling Ventus as "just a Roxas clone, but without his personality." In contrast to 1UP's comments towards Ventus' actions in Cinderella's world, VanOrd commented that such interactions to be "more bothersome than boisterous." Writing for GamesRadar, Chris Antistaer called Ventus a "Roxas-clone", and did not understand why he was briefly featured in "Kingdom Hearts II".

Ceanothus velutinus

Ceanothus velutinus, with the common names Snowbrush ceanothus, Red root, and Tobacco brush, is a species of shrub in the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to western North America from British Columbia to California to Colorado, where it grows in several habitat types including coniferous forest, chaparral, and various types of woodland. 
Description.
"Ceanothus velutinus" grows up to 4 meters tall but generally remains under three, and forms colonies of individuals which tangle together to form nearly impenetrable thickets. The aromatic evergreen leaves are alternately arranged, each up to 8 centimeters long. The leaves are oval in shape with minute glandular teeth along the edges, and shiny green and hairless on the top surface. 
The plentiful inflorescences are long clusters of white flowers. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule a few millimeters long which snaps open explosively to expel the three seeds onto the soil, where they may remain in a buried seed bank for well over 200 years before sprouting. The seed is coated in a very hard outer layer that must be scarified, generally by wildfire, before it can germinate. Like most other ceanothus, this species fixes nitrogen via actinomycetes on its roots. 
Uses.
Some Plateau Indian tribes drank a boil of this plant to induce sweating as a treatment for colds, fevers, and influenza. Leaves were also used when rinsing to help prevent dandruff. 
"C. velutinus" was known as "red root" by many Native American tribes due to the color of the inner root bark, and was used as a medicine for treating lymphatic disorders, ovarian cysts, fibroid tumors, and tonsillitis. Clinical studies of the alkaloid compounds in "C. velutinus" has verified its effectiveness in treating high blood pressure and lymphatic blockages.

1968 Heathrow BKS Air Transport Airspeed Ambassador crash

On 3 July 1968 Airspeed Ambassador registration "G-AMAD" of BKS Air Transport, crashed at London Heathrow Airport, damaging two parked Trident airliners as it cartwheeled into the incomplete London Heathrow Terminal 1, then under construction. Six of the eight people on board the Ambassador were killed, along with the eight racehorses being transported on it.
Accident.
The Ambassador, construction number 5211, recently converted to a "horsebox" transport, was on a flight from Deauville, France to Heathrow Airport. It was transporting eight racehorses belonging to businessman William Hill together with five grooms. As the aircraft was landing on Heathrow's runway 28R the left wing dropped, and the wing tip and left landing gear touched the grass adjacent to the runway. The crew tried to increase power to go-around and climb away, but the bank angle increased. The aircraft hit two parked empty British European Airways Hawker Siddeley Tridents, knocking the tail fin off one ("G-ARPI") and slicing off the entire tail section of the other ("G-ARPT"). The Ambassador cartwheeled following the impact and slid upside down coming up against the ground floor of the terminal building where there was an explosion.
Six people on board the Ambassador died, including the flight crew and three of five grooms, along with all eight horses. The other two grooms were seriously injured as were two people on the ground. A further 29 people on the ground received slight injuries.
Of the two Trident aircraft, G-ARPT was damaged beyond economic repair and G-ARPI was subsequently repaired but was later destroyed when it crashed on 18 June 1972 in what became known as the Staines Air Disaster. A Viscount (G-APKF) received slight damage.
All other Ambassadors were grounded pending the result of an inquiry. The starboard rod from the aircraft was tested and found satisfactory but rods from some other Ambassadors showed signs of cracking and when tested failed in a similar manner to G-AMAD's port rod. The rods on aircraft were strengthened and shown to be capable of 37,000 hours flight time.
Probable cause.
The left (port) flap operating rod had failed due to metal fatigue. While the mechanism had failed, the compensating mechanism between the two sets of flaps remained intact. The port flaps had retracted but the compensator caused the starboard ones to extend further. The resulting asymmety of lift resulted in the roll to port. 
The pilot probably tried to overshoot and set the flaps to the correct 10 degrees, but due to the mechanism design this was not sufficient to cause the starboard flaps to retract (which would have taken 25 seconds in any event). The Department of Transport report concluded that whatever the pilot's actions, it was "doubtful" whether an accident could have been avoided.
After the accident all Ambassadors were fitted with steel reinforcements to the flap operating rods.

Androniscus dentiger

Androniscus dentiger, the rosy woodlouse or pink woodlouse is a species of woodlouse found from the British Isles to North Africa.
Description.
"A. dentiger" is a small woodlouse, at only 6 mm (¼ in) long, and is characteristically pink or orange in colour, with a yellow stripe along the midline of the dorsal surface, which divides in two towards the animal's tail. It has large eyes for its size and a granular exoskeleton.
Ecology.
In the British Isles, "A. dentiger" is found in a wide variety of habitats, including coastal areas, gardens, old quarries and caves. It lives where there is a significant amount of lime available, and is reported to show a preference for Anglican churchyards over Catholic ones because the older, Protestant churches used ox-blood mortar.
In the south of its range, "A. dentiger" is primarily troglobitic, with populations in different cave systems being genetically isolated by the lack of migration between caves. Animals like "A. dentiger" which prefer to live in caves, but are not restricted to the cave environment may be termed "troglophilic".
In North America, "A. dentiger" is only known to occur in greenhouses.
Subspecies.
According to some authors, "A. dentiger" may be considered a complex of sibling species or cryptic species . Six subspecies are recognised:

20th Connecticut Infantry Regiment

The 20th Connecticut Infantry (20th Conn) was an infantry regiment of the Union Army of the Potomac, which fought in several pivotal battles in the Eastern and Western theaters during the American Civil War. Formed in July 1862, the regiment was assigned to the XII Corps, and later the XX Corps took part in a number of actions including those at Charcellorsville, Gettysburg, The Atlanta Campaign, Sherman's March to the Sea, , and The Grand Review .
History.
Raised in July 1862, upon formation the regiment was placed under the command of Colonel William Wooster, a businessman in civilian life. Wooster was chosen for command because of his quick learning of military tactics and strong personality. Within a few months, Wooster and the men of the 20th Conn found themselves on the front lines as a part of the Union XII Corps. The 20th took part in its baptism of fire at the Battle of Chancellorsville (May 1–6, 1863).
On May 2, 1863, at Chancellorsville, the unit suffered heavy casualties as they and other units of the XI Corps bore the brunt of CSA General Stonewall Jackson's surprise assault. However, it is the unit's role in the next major battle that they would be remembered for.
On July 2, 1863, on the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, several units were moved from the Union right flank on Culp's Hill to the south to reinforce the left flank which was being attacked. Seeing an opportunity, Confederate General Richard Ewell launched an attack on Culp's Hill and his men occupied the earthworks deserted by the withdrawn units. Attempts were made to retake the fortifications, but due to miscommunications, such attempts were unsuccessful and resulted in heavy Union casualties.
At dawn on July 3, 1863, the commander of the Confederate army, Robert E. Lee, devised a plan to launch a massive assault on the center of the Union line (the attack now infamously known as Pickett's Charge). This plan also called for Richard Ewell's troops to renew their assault on Culp's Hill to keep any Union regiments from leaving that area to reinforce the assault's target area. Long before Pickett's men were ready to make the charge, Ewell's men, still occupying the earthworks, awoke to a ferocious artillery barrage from Union batteries nearby. Forced into action by the bombardment, Ewell sent a message back to Lee saying that he could not wait for the main assault to begin to attack, and was sending his troops into battle.
The artillery that the Confederate soldiers woke up to was devastating, and its effectiveness can only be credited to Colonel Wooster and the 20th Connecticut. The 20th was tasked with scouting the movements of the enemy and relaying that information to nearby batteries. They stayed in the woods overlooking the Confederate position and sent back constant updates. It was an incredibly dangerous task because in order to give accurate reports, they had to be very close to the target. Being in the impact zone was incredibly dangerous. Several men of the 20th were wounded/killed due to misfires or faulty ammunition. The last one to be wounded was Private George W. Warner, who lost both of his arms when a misfired shell detonated above him. Infuriated, Col. Wooster sent a report back to the batteries which allegedly said that if one more of his men were injured from a misfire, he would pull the 20th out of position, turn them around, and charge the batteries himself. The courier who carried the message added the comment, "he'd do it, too, so be careful." Save for a few mishaps, the artillery was incredibly effective. It did enough damage that the following infantry assault drove Ewell's men from the hill. Other Confederate units in the area attempted to charge up the hill and while they outnumbered their adversaries, the Union units on Culp's Hill were very well entrenched, and the attacks were repulsed with heavy losses.
It was one of the first times that an infantry unit was used as a scout force for artillery. Citing the effectiveness, the tactic was used by several other Union generals throughout the rest of the war, including Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman. This became a common practice in the army and the tactic is still being employed today. While the 20th Connecticut Infantry Regiment was left out of the combat at Gettysburg, their role in securing Culp's Hill would forever change how infantry was used in warfare.

SV Estelle

SV "Estelle" is a fair trade cargo Bermuda schooner, currently the biggest sail ship in Finnish register. She was built in Emden, Germany in 1922 as a 42-meter (137.8 feet), steel-hulled ship for trawl-fishing in the Baltic Sea. "Estelle"s hometown is Turku. She was long owned by Eestaas and operated by Uusi Tuuli. Now she belongs to a "Ship to Gaza" company Northern Breeze AB, registered in Turku, Finland.
"Estelle" was previously maintained by volunteers who had the desire to sail to Africa to export assistance supplies and bring back fair trade goods and operate according the ideals of Fair Trade. She made her first trip to Africa in 2002, before which she also visited the Mediterranean Sea, Ireland and some harbors of Northern Europe. In addition, many of the ship's crew have been trained while sailing in the Baltic Sea.
After her trip to Angola, "Estelle" has mainly sailed in the Baltic Sea, participated in the Tall Ships Race of 2003, and collaborated with Greenpeace on research and campaign work. "Estelle" is also constantly training new crew members since it is open to practically any one.
"Estelle"s operations are primarily based on volunteers. Operations strive for environmental sustainability, solidarity and global equality. Since 2003, Prometheus camps have been organized on "Estelle" every summer as a non-religious alternative to confirmation camp. During the camp the boat tours around the archipelago near Turku.
"Estelle" joined Sail Training International's (STI) Class A Forum as a member during the spring of 2005. The forum is intended for training the crews of the world's largest sailboats, improving operations and other related development.
On 27 April 2010, "Estelle" board member Jyri Jaakkola was killed by paramilitaries in Mexico.
In 2012, "Estelle" was sold to Swedish interests for an attempt to break the Gaza blockade.
Gaza mission.
"Estelle" departed for the Gaza Strip to try to break Israel's maritime blockade in the summer of 2012. "We are sailing with peaceful intentions," a crew member said. "Estelle" is Swedish-owned, but Finnish-flagged ship. According to the Ship to Gaza organization, there are also eleven Swedes, two Finns, five Greeks, four Norwegians, three Israelis, three Spanish citizens, one Canadian and one Italian aboard.
"It will not be allowed to go into the Gaza Strip port," said Yuval Donio-Gideon, First Secretary at the Israeli Embassy in Finland. "Because Gaza is ruled by a terror organization, we cannot make sure what goes into Gaza, we cannot inspect that and cannot trust the authorities in Gaza to inspect that and to make sure that materials would help the terrorists in Gaza would get to their hands."
On October 20, the Israeli military seized the vessel without incident and took it to the port of Ashdod. Those on board are to be turned over to the police.
"Estelle" is the latest in a series of vessels manned by activists who have tried to challenge Israel's blockade on Gaza, imposed after Hamas seized power in 2007.

Internet hunting

Internet hunting is the practice of hunting via remotely controlled firearms that can be aimed and shot using online webcams. The first internet hunting website, Live-Shot.com, was created in 2005 by John Lockwood, who saw it as a way to provide an authentic hunting experience for disabled persons. According to the Humane Society, the operation consisted of "a fenced pen stocked with animals Lockwood set up a tripod with a camera and a firearm". 
Almost as soon as internet hunting was introduced in the U.S. state of Texas, strong opposition to the practice developed among pro-gun and pro-hunting organizations, including the National Rifle Association and Safari Club International, as well as among animal rights and environmental groups. The majority of hunters do not consider the practice to be hunting, as it does not conform to the rules of a "fair chase".
As of August 2008, forty U.S. states had enacted laws or regulations to ban internet hunting. These bans were supported by a Humane Society campaign, and according to the organization, internet hunting is no longer being practiced. Critics say Internet hunting never existed as a viable industry, making much of the legislation curtailing it "a testament to public alarm over Internet threats and the gilded life of legislation that nobody opposes". Advocates see the legislation as a proactive measure that may yet curb the practice, which could easily spring up in states or other countries where it is not prohibited.

Ceanothus verrucosus is a species of shrub in the buckthorn family Rhamnaceae known by the common names wart-stem ceanothus, barranca brush, and white coast ceanothus. It is native to Baja California and San Diego County, where it grows in coastal chaparral and scrub. Most of the valuable coastal land that hosts this plant in the San Diego area has been claimed for development, but several populations still remain scattered around the region, such as one protected at Torrey Pines.
Description.
"Ceanothus verrucosus" is an erect shrub approaching 3 meters in maximum height. The bumpy evergreen leaves are alternately arranged, each up to about 1.5 centimeters long. The inflorescence is a cluster of flowers up to 2 centimeters long. The flower is white except for its characteristic dark center. The fruit is a capsule about half a centimeter long.

Nieuport London

The Nieuport London was a British night bomber aircraft designed in the First World War. A twin-engined triplane, the London was dogged by the unavailability and unreliability of its engines, and did not fly until 1920. Only two were built.
Development and design.
In 1918, Henry Folland, chief designer of the Nieuport (England) Ltd (later to become the Nieuport & General Aircraft Co Ltd.), formerly of the Royal Aircraft Factory and designer of the S.E.5, designed the Nieuport London to meet the RAF Type VII specification for a night bomber, an order for six Londons was placed in July 1918.
The London was a twin-engined triplane with equal span, two-bay wings, powered by the new ABC Dragonfly radial engine. It was designed for ease of production, and was built of wood with use of metal fittings minimised. The angular fuselage was covered by ¼ inch (6 mm) thick wooden boarding joined by Tongue and groove joints, techniques more usually found in furniture manufacture. The fabric covered wings were unstaggered and had ailerons fitted to each wing, while the tail unit had a prominent ventral fin similar to that fitted to Folland's S.E.5 and Nighthawk fighters. Bombload was 2,250 lb (1,023 kg), while as the London was solely intended to operate by night, defensive armament was limited to a pair of Lewis guns in the nose.
The end of the First World War meant that the RAFs needs for heavy bombers could be met by the existing Vickers Vimy, and the last four Londons were cancelled in December 1918. Despite the great expectations placed on the Dragonfly, which had been ordered into large scale production prior to testing being carried out, and formed the powerplant for many of the types planned to equip the Royal Air Force of 1919, the engine was disappointing, with the prototype Londons being delayed by many months before engines were delivered, with the first eventually flying on 13 April 1920, followed by the second in July. Despite its simple structure and angular lines, handling proved excellent, it being possible to remove the ailerons from the lower two sets of wings while not adversely affecting control. Although Folland had designed a civil transport version capable of carrying 13 passengers or heavy loads of cargo or mail, Nieuport and General closed down in August 1920, ending development of the London.

Nate Robinson (American football)

Nathaniel Robinson (born January 18, 1985) is an American football defensive tackle who is currently a free agent. He was signed by the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent in 2008. Once a heralded high school athlete, Robinson was an underachiever during his college football career at Rutgers and Akron.
High school career.
A native of Irvington, New Jersey, Robinson attended Irvington High School, a school that struggled with gang-related violence. As a junior in 2001, he recorded 82 tackles, including 17 tackles for loss, as well as 14 quarterback sacks, nine pass deflections and six caused fumbles. He missed most of his senior season due to a knee injury, but was still rated one of the best defensive lineman in the nation. In fact, "Rivals.com" gave Robinson their only five-star rating among defensive tackles, and ranked him No. 1 in a class that also included Sedrick Ellis, Marcus Thomas, and Fili Moala.
After official visits to Rutgers, Syracuse, and Miami (FL), Robinson committed to the Hurricanes, together with the other five-star recruit from New Jersey, Greg Olsen of Wayne Hills. However, unlike Olsen, Robinson was unable to meet the school's academic qualification standards. Although Robinson's SAT score of 800 meet the NCAA minimum for high school students with a 3.0 grade point average, it was 20 points shy of Miami's institutional standard. With the perspective of being declared ineligible, Robinson decided not to enroll at Miami, and instead went to Rutgers. He was the only four- or five-star recruit in Rutgers' class.
College career.
The injury from his high school senior year also caused Robinson to miss the first half of his true freshman year at Rutgers. He only saw action in the final six games of the season, and recorded a total of three tackles and a single quarterback sack—coincidentally against the Miami Hurricanes. In his sophomore year, Robinson played in eight of 11 games, including the final six contests, finishing the season with 15 tackles, including five solo stops. In April 2005, he was dismissed for violation of team policy, and eventually transferred to Akron.
After sitting out the 2005 season while fulfilling NCAA transfer requirements, Robinson played 11 of 12 games for the Akron Zips in 2006. He had 23 tackles, including six for losses with a sack. In his senior year, he who was moved in and out of the lineup, registering 26 tackles, including five for a loss, for the season.
Professional career.
2008 NFL Draft.
After a dispointing college career, Robinson was projected to go undrafted in the 2008 NFL Draft. He was eventually signed by the Giants.
New York Sentinels.
Robinson was signed by the New York Sentinels of the United Football League on September 9, 2009. He was released before the season began.
Toronto Argonauts.
On April 4, 2011, Robinson signed with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League. He was released by the Argonauts on June 15, 2011.

Medzhybizh Fortress

Medzhybizh Castle (, Medzhybiz'kyi zamok), built as a bulwark against Ottoman expansion in the 1540s, became one of the strongest fortresses of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland in Podolia. It is situated at the confluence of the Southern Bug and Buzhenka rivers, in the town of Medzhybizh (Polish: "Międzybuż"), Ukraine. Today the castle is part of the State Historical-Cultural Preserve.
Originally the wooden castle was founded sometime in 1146 by Bolokh (or Bolekhiv) princes. The castle survived the Mongol's invastion, but in 1254 it was dismantled by Daniel of Galicia on the Mongol's orders as several other castles and fortresses in the Kingdom of Rus. The castle was rebuilt by Koriatovych princes after the Grand Duke of Lithuania defeated the Golden Horde at the Battle of Blue Waters in 1362. 
Its royal status the castle received already back in 1385, but in 1432 Medzhybizh with most of Podilia was passed to the Polish Crown. The castle was in a state possession for sometime. Sometimes in 1540 the castle was passed to Mikołaj Sieniawski who made some major renovations. The castle's founder was Mikołaj Sieniawski, and the Sieniawski family owned Medzhybizh (Polish: "Międzybuż") until its extinction in the early 18th century. The stronghold was reconquered from the Turks in 1699 and passed to the Czartoryski family in 1731. 
The last rebuilding effort was undertaken by the Russian imperial authorities in the 19th century. Much restoration has been carried out on the fortress since 1968. Within the walls are a small-scale museum and a church from 1586.

Quantitative investing

Quantitative investing represents an investing technique typically employed by the most sophisticated, technically advanced hedge funds. These firms employ fast computers to find predictable patterns within financial data. Some of the larger investment managers using quantitative investing include Renaissance Technologies' Medallion Fund, AQR Capital, Winton Capital Management, D. E. Shaw & Co., Numeric Investors, Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co. LLC (GMO), First Quadrant, Robeco.
Typically, quant investing is implemented by people who have spent time in the physics, math, computer science, or statistics disciplines. The condensed results of quantitative analyses, however, can be readily accessible to all far-from-quantitative investors, when presented in an intuitive framework.
The process consists of thorough examination of vast databases searching for repeating patterns—persistent occurrences of a phenomenon, correlations among liquid assets ("statistical arbitrage" or "pairs trading"), or price-movement patterns (trend following or mean reversion).

Lucy Randolph Mason

Lucy Randolph Mason was an activist in the union movement, the consumer movement and the civil rights movement in the mid-20th century.
Born near Alexandria, Virginia in 1882, Mason vowed as a child to continue her family's long tradition of community service and commitment to human rights. Her father and grandfather were Episcopal ministers. She was also a fifth-generation descendant of George Mason, author of the Virginia Declaration of Rights which served as the model for the Bill of Rights in the U.S. Constitution. 
Mason sought to bring about more humane conditions for working people, ending racial injustice and ensuring that union organizers throughout the South were guaranteed the constitutional rights to free speech, assembly and due process that George Mason had helped establish.
Early years.
She began her social reform work in Richmond, Virginia, where she had spent her childhood. While in her 20s, she supported herself by working as a stenographer but devoted much of her free time to volunteer social service work and political activities on behalf of women's suffrage. In 1914, the Richmond YWCA offered her a job as its industrial secretary, a post she held until 1918, when she stepped down to care for her invalid father. In 1923, Mason resumed her post at the Richmond YWCA, working there until 1932. 
During this period, Mason stimulated YWCA involvement with economic advancement in the African American community, and she generated public support for state labor laws that would ensure safer workplaces, end child labor, raise minimum wages and shorten work hours. Mason also traveled throughout the South promoting voluntary employer agreements that incorporated fair labor standards. To aid in this effort, she wrote "Standards for Workers in Southern Industry" (1931), the first pamphlet of its kind. Mason relied on consumer pressure to raise labor standards as well. 
She belonged to the Union Label League in Richmond and was a frequent speaker to community and labor groups about the importance of buying union-made products and services. During World War I, American Federation of Labor (AFL) President Samuel Gompers appointed Mason as the Virginia chairwoman of the Women in Industry Committee, a division of the wartime National Advisory Committee on Labor.
In 1932, Mason succeeded Florence Kelley as the general secretary of the National Consumers League (NCL), the leading national advocate of fair labor standards. From the 1900s to the 1930s, the NCL worked to pass protective labor laws and to convince consumers to buy only goods and services produced by workers who enjoyed a living wage and decent working conditions. Under Mason, the NCL won the passage of new state labor laws, lobbied for improved labor codes in the 1933 National Industrial Recovery Act and helped ensure the passage of the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
The South and the CIO.
During congressional hearings on the FLSA, Mason met Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) President John L. Lewis, who helped arrange a job for her as the CIO's public relations representative for the South. In July 1937, at age 55, Mason moved into the Textile Workers Organizing Committee offices in Atlanta, and became the CIO's "roving ambassador" for the next 16 years.
For Mason, the CIO was "a training ground for citizenship" for Southern workers, a vehicle "to bring democracy to the South" and the means to alleviate the economic and racial injustices experienced by minorities and the poor. Mason traveled alone to small towns where union organizers and their sympathizers had been shot, beaten, threatened and jailed. She cornered hostile sheriffs, judges, newspaper editors, politicians and ministers, explaining workers' rights to organize and bargain under the new federal statutes and promoting an understanding of the need for unions.
She was known by friend and foe as "Miss Lucy." Her social status as a Southern lady and the daughter of an old, respected Virginia family often gained her access to political and community leaders when others were denied. Miss Lucy's success also rested on her blunt speech, her calm yet steely demeanor and her ability to bring civil liberties violations to the attention of federal officials, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Mason convinced Roosevelt to send a special federal investigator to Memphis in 1940, for example, in the wake of physical attacks on the United Rubber Workers' organizers who were trying to create an interracial union.
After 1944, Mason worked with the CIO Political Action Committee in the South, helping to register union members, black and white, and working for the elimination of the poll tax. She also forged lasting links between labor and religious groups. She helped get the Southern Baptist Convention to adopt a resolution in 1938 recognizing "the right of labor to organize and engage in collective bargaining to the end that labor may have a fair and living wage, such as will provide not only the necessities of life, but for recreation, pleasure, and culture."
In the 1940s, she organized interfaith, multi-union and interracial groups in Atlanta and other Southern cities of workers dedicated to building bridges between organized labor and the churches. Eventually, these local groups formed the National Religion and Labor Foundation.
In 1953, due to ill health, Mason retired from active union work. She completed her autobiography, "To Win These Rights", in 1952. That same year, she was honored with the Social Justice Award from the National Religion and Labor Foundation. She died in 1959 in Atlanta.

Synopsis.
The 39-episode program shot in color, which aired new episodes in 1956, is set in Langtry in Val Verde County in southwest Texas, where Bean held court in his combination general store and saloon.

Recurring cast members.
Tristram Coffin portrayed different characters in six episodes of "Judge Roy Bean", including the series premiere, "The Judge of Pecos Valley", in which a train robber is loose in the area, and Bean sets out to capture him. Coffin appears in the third segment, "The Horse Thief", in which a rancher is jailed for stealing a horse, and Bean must keep a mob from getting out of control. Other episodes featuring Coffin are "The Refugee", "Border Raiders", "The Cross Draw Kid", and "The Wedding of Old Sam" in his role of Sam Haskins. Character actor X Brands appeared in various roles fifteen times on "Judge Roy Bean".

In "Sunburnt Gold", Bean pursues a gang that steals gold coins, melts them down and turns them into nuggets so that they cannot be identified. In "The Runaway", a boy flees home because he thinks his father is cowardly for not resisting a recalcitrant boss. In "Slightly Prodigal", a woman arrives in Langtry in search of her son, who has turned into an outlaw. In "Black Jack", the judge seeks to return an escaped train robber to prison. In "Judge Declares a Holiday", Bean confronts a con man who arranges horse races but flees with the bet money before the event can be held. In "Citizen Romeo", Bean learns about a plan to smuggle guns and ammunition to the Indians, and he encounters an organ grinder with a monkey as he tries to halt the smuggling.
Sammee Tong appeared in the title role of the episode "Ah Sid, Cowboy", with Glenn Strange, later the bartender Sam on "Gunsmoke", as Fallon.

Production notes.
Unlike most syndicated westerns of the 1950s, which were black-and-white, "Judge Roy Bean" was filmed in color by the Barrett Company in Pioneertown, California. The program was not extended for a second season. Seven years later, Buchanan became particularly known for his role as the laid-back Uncle Joe Carson on the CBS sitcom, "Petticoat Junction" with Bea Benaderet. 
Series producer Russell Hayden thereafter released his second syndicated western, "26 Men" starring Tristram Coffin.

<doc id="21613310" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21613310" title="Eigil Knuth">
Eigil Knuth

Count Eigil Knuth (8 August 1903 — 12 March 1996) was a Danish explorer, archaeologist, sculptor and writer. He is referred to as the Nestor ("elder statesman") of Danish polar explorers. His archaeological investigations were made in Peary Land and adjacent areas of High Arctic Greenland. Knuth was made a Knight of the Dannebrog.
Early years.
Knuth was born in Klampenborg, Denmark (near Copenhagen). His parents were count Eigil Knuth sr, a captain, and Djimphna (née Gamel).
His hero was the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen who, in 1888, was the first to cross the Greenland icecap; the trip was financed by State Councillor Augustinus Gamel, a Danish businessman, and Knuth's maternal grandfather. Gamel's birth gift to his grandson was a present Gamel had received from Nansen: the compass Nansen carried on his Greenland icecap expedition.
Knuth studied building technology at Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, and then woodcarving at Val Gardena in Italy between 1926 and 1928. He published his first book, on the subject of philosophy, in 1927, revealing an affinity with the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard. In 1932, Knuth graduated as a gymnastics teacher from Ollerup Physical Training College in Denmark.
Career.
Knuth first trip to Greenland occurred in 1932 accompanying Dr. Aage Roussel from the National Museum of Denmark on an archaeological dig to excavate old Norse sites on West Greenland's coast. Knuth spent the next two years as an art critic for the Copenhagen newspaper "Dagens Nyheder".
Assisting Dr. Roussell and Dr. Poul Nørlund during the summer of 1934, Knuth excavated old Norse ruins at Igaliko. In 1935, Dr. Helge Larsen, Ebbe Munck, and Knuth, as archaeologist, assisted on the Augustine Courtauld Expedition to East Greenland, during which Gunbjrns Fjeld, Greenland's highest mountain, was climbed. The following summer, in 1936, Knuth, Robert Gessain, and Michel Perez participated in the French Trans-Greenland Expedition under Paul-Emile Victor, crossing the Greenland "inlandsis" (ice cap), starting at Christianshåb in the west, and ending at Tasiilaq/Angmagsalik, an Inuit settlement in the east. It was here that Knuth worked as a sculptor, producing a notable series of busts of the local Inuit.
Knuth financed the bulk of his next expedition, known as "Dansk Nordgrønlandsekspedition 1938—39, udsendt af Alf Trolle, Ebbe Munck og Eigil Knuth til Minde on Danmark-Ekspeditionen" ("Danish Northeast Greenland Expedition 1938—39, sent out by Alf Trolle, Ebbe Munck, and Eigil Knuth in memory of the Denmark Expedition"), arriving in Greenland with his co-leader and friend, Ebbe Munck, on 19 June 1938. The crew consisietd of six more men, a. o. the botanist Paul Gelting. It was the first Danish Greenland expedition to make use of an airplane, a de Havilland Tiger Moth. With the start of war, Knuth could not return to Greenland as planned, instead, becoming an announcer for Denmark Radio in the Danish resistance movement.
During the period of 1948—50, Knuth was back in Greenland and made several discoveries, including a large tool collection of the Thule culture and tool fragments of the Dorset culture. His most important contribution, however, was the first identification and demonstration of Independence I culture and Independence II culture, immigration waves of Paleo-Eskimo, spread apart by almost 3000 years. He named the cultures "Independence" after the Independence Fjord located in Peary Land.
In addition to sculpting, he produced paintings and watercolours. Some of his works were on display at the 1939 New York World's Fair.
Later years.
Knuth's Danish Peary Land Expeditions ended in 1995 with his last visit to Brønlundhus at Brønlund Fjord which served for almost 50 years as his Peary Land expedition headquarters. He died in Copenhagen the following year and he is buried at Bispebjerg Cemetery.
Legacy.
Before his death, Knuth was unable to complete a comprehensive book summarizing his Peary Land archaeological findings. That task fell upon Bjarne Grønnow, heir to Knuth's archival information. "The Northernmost Ruins of the Globe: Eigil Knuth's archaeological investigations in Peary Land and adjacent areas of High Arctic Greenland" (2003) is a compilation of Knuth's findings and observations.
His portrait busts are in Nuuk.

Nominated by the PLO Executive Committee in 1983 to serve as the PLO's representative in Washington, D.C., from 1994 through 2005 he represented the Palestinian National Authority in the American capital. Amb. Abdel Rahman is currently the Executive Director and General Coordinator of the Arab-Latin American Forum and a Senior Advisor to the Global Foundation for Democracy and Development (FUNGLODE) 
Ambassador Abdel Rahman began his academic career at Damascus University in the early 1960s. However, his active participation in the university's Palestinian student political movement brought him to the attention of the Syrian Mukhabarat, eventually forcing him to flee Syria in 1964 for Latin America. Ambassador Abdel Rahman ended up spending one year in Argentina and three years in Brazil before moving on to various Caribbean nations and eventually settling in Puerto Rico.
In 1971, Ambassador Abdel Rahman graduated from the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico with a bachelors degree in political science and sociology.

When on November 22, 1974, the organization received formal observer status, Ambassador Abdel Rahman became its deputy representative in New York. Just weeks prior to the announcement, Ambassador Abdel Rahman was the victim of a terrorist attack in his New York offices by two armed members of the Jewish Defense League who entered the building and beat him with pipes and bats, leaving him with permanent scars on his forehead.
In 1983, Ambassador Abdel Rahman was appointed to serve as the PLO's official representative to the United States, a position he held (save for a brief two-year interlude as the organization's representative in Canada between 1991–1992) until the signing of the Declaration of Principles in September 1993. From 1994 to 2005, he served as chief representative of the Palestinian National Authority to the United States. As a fluent Spanish speaker, he concurrently served as the PNA's liaison to the governments of Colombia, Chile and Venezuela. 
In addition to his official representative positions, Ambassador Abdel Rahman was an active participant in the Peace Process in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, serving as a senior political advisor to the Palestinian negotiating teams at the Madrid Conference of 1991, Wye River Conference and Camp David 2000 Summit.
During his tenure in Washington, D.C., Ambassador Abdel Rahman was a frequent guest on television news programs and the college lecture circuit.

Southland (TV series)

Southland (stylized as SOUTHLAND) is an American drama series created by writer Ann Biderman and produced by Warner Bros. Television. It originally aired on NBC for one season from April 9 to May 21, 2009, and then on TNT for four additional seasons from March 2, 2010, to April 17, 2013. On May 1, 2009, NBC announced that "Southland" had been renewed for a second season with an initial 13-episode order to begin airing on Friday, September 25, 2009, at 9:00 pm, one hour earlier than its original time slot. On August 27, 2009, shortly before its scheduled premiere, NBC moved the opening of its second season to October 23, 2009, citing the need to promote the show more fully. On October 8, 2009, NBC announced that the series had been canceled.
On November 2, 2009, TNT announced it had purchased the rights to "Southland"s original seven episodes, as well as six completed episodes from its second season. "Southland" began airing on TNT on January 12, 2010. On April 26, 2010, TNT announced it had picked up "Southland" for a ten-episode third season to begin airing on January 4, 2011. TNT's renewal of the show included a substantial budget cut and corresponding cast reduction. "Southland" was renewed for a ten-episode fourth season on March 22, 2011, which premiered on January 17, 2012. The series was renewed for a ten-episode fifth season which began airing February 13, 2013.
On May 10, 2013, TNT announced that "Southland" had been cancelled after five seasons.
Plot.
"Southland" takes a "raw and authentic look" at Los Angeles and the lives of the LAPD officers who police it. The show's first season centers on the experiences and interactions of LAPD patrol officers and detectives, and is more a character-driven drama than a police procedural.
Among the characters are rookie Officer Ben Sherman and his training officer, John Cooper who, unknown to most of his colleagues, is homosexual; Detective Lydia Adams, who must balance work with the responsibility of living with her mother; Officer Chickie Brown, who aspires to be the first woman on the LAPD's elite SWAT team; and Detective Sammy Bryant, whose home life interferes with his working life.
After its first season on NBC, "Southland" moved to TNT network. The second season placed less emphasis on the ensemble cast, instead focusing more on the Adams, Sherman, Cooper and Bryant characters and their partners. Also, the weekly stories centered more on how crimes came together, with fewer serialized story lines.
Production.
The series was created by Emmy Award-winning writer Ann Biderman, who began her television writing career on the first season of police drama "NYPD Blue". The series' executive producers are Biderman, Christopher Chulack, and John Wells. Wells and Chulack, both also Emmy Award winners, had previously worked together on critically acclaimed medical drama "ER" and emergency services drama "Third Watch". Many other crew members had previously worked with Wells and Chulack on these series. Wells and Biderman also write for the series and Chulack is a regular director. Biderman left her executive producer position after the second season but continued to write for the series' third season.
Ex-police officer Angela Amato Velez served as a consulting producer and writer for the first season; she had previously worked for the executive producers on "Third Watch". Dee Johnson also served as a consulting producer and writer for the first season; she had previously worked with Wells and Chulack on "ER". Emmy Award-winning writing team Mitchell Burgess & Robin Green were hired as executive consultants and writers for the second and third seasons; they had previously worked together as executive producers on "The Sopranos". Diana Son served as a consulting producer and writer for the second season; she had previously worked on the crime drama "".
David Graziano became a co-executive producer for the second season. Andrew Stearn was a producer for the first two seasons and was promoted to co-executive producer for the third season; he had previously worked on "Third Watch". Jonathan Lisco was hired as a co-executive producer for the third season; he is a former lawyer and created the New Orleans police drama "K-Ville". Jason Horwitch, creator of AMC's "Rubicon", joined the show as consulting producer for the fourth season.
"ER" and "Third Watch" veteran Nelson McCormick is also a regular director for "Southland". Steadicam expert J. Michael Muro serves as a regular cinematographer and occasional director for the series. Dana Gonzales is the other regular director of photography.
The producers used both actual and former gang members to play the role of gangsters in "Southland".
Reception.
"Southland" has received positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the first season received an average score of 69, based on 22 reviews and the second season received an average score of 77, based on 12 reviews both indicating "Generally favorable reviews". Upon returning for its third and fourth season the series received wide critical acclaim, receiving an average score of 81, based on 9 reviews for the third season and an average score of 87, based on 7 reviews for the fourth season both indicating "Universal acclaim". The fifth season received a rating of 86 out of 100 based on 8 reviews.
Alessandra Stanley of "The New York Times" compared "Southland" favorably to series like "The Shield", "Rescue Me" and "The Wire" in citing the series debut as "one of the most gripping opening episodes of any network crime series". Noting the show's "bold, contemporary tone", Stanley concluded that ""Southland" is commendably stinting and cold, a series that doesn’t aim to please, and is all the more pleasurable for it." In a second review a year later, Mike Hale was less effusive in his praise. While commending the series for fine performances from its cast—in particular Cudlitz, McKenzie and Hatosy—and its combination of straightforward immediate plots and long-range storytelling, Hale criticized the "heavyhandedness" he saw in some of the writing, noting especially the "sententious lectures about the nature of police work" delivered to Sherman by Cooper in the pilot episode. He finds the show "worthy" but in need of work to qualify as a classic.
Dorothy Rabinowitz of "The Wall Street Journal" says "Prattle is, in any case, a minor note compared with the crackling pace of the first script, its evocative mood of menace at every turn, each police car racing to destinations that will reveal who knows what tragedy or unspeakable sight." Matt Zoller Seitz of "Vulture" applauded the series' realism, and stated "It's the most engrossing cop series since season one of NBC's "", and maybe the most raggedy and real."
"Southland" received three nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Stunt Coordination, winning the award twice in 2011 and 2012, and was nominated in 2013. In 2012, the series was awarded with a Peabody Award.
Home media releases.
Shortly before its TNT premiere, Warner Home Video released the first season on DVD in an uncensored version, with the profanities intact.
In May 2011, Warner Home Video also released the second season in a similarly uncensored version. This title is currently only available through the studio's manufacture-on-demand (MOD) program.
On February 5, 2013, a box set titled "Southland: The Complete Second, Third, and Fourth Seasons" was released on DVD; it included over an hour of bonus features.
On August 13, 2013, Warner Home Video released the show's final season on DVD.

<doc id="21613384" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21613384" title="Pluralist theories of truth">
Pluralist theories of truth

A pluralist theory of truth is a theory of truth which posits that there may be more than one property that makes a proposition true.
Most traditional theories of truth are monist: that is, they hold that there is one and only property the having of which makes a belief or proposition true. Pluralist theories of truth deny this assumption. According to pluralism, ethical propositions might be true by more than one property, for example by virtue of coherence; propositions about the physical world might also be true by corresponding to the objects and properties they are about. Pluralism, in short, holds out the prospect that propositions might be "true in more than one way".
Crispin Wright is the most well-known advocate of pluralism about truth. In his 1992 book "Truth and Objectivity", Wright argued that any predicate which satisfied certain platitudes about truth qualified as a truth predicate. In some discourses, Wright argued, the role of the truth predicate might be played by the notion of superassertibility.
Michael Lynch (philosopher) has recently advocated a different type of pluralism about truth. In a series of articles and in his 2009 book "Truth as One and Many" Lynch argues that we should see truth as a functional property capable of being multiply manifested in distinct properties like correspondence or coherence.

Hakozaki Shrine

History.
Hakozaki Shrine was founded in 923, with the transfer of the spirit of the "kami Hachiman" from Daibu Hachiman Shrine in what is Honami Commandry, Chikuzen Province in Kyūshū.
During the first Mongol invasion on November 19, 1274 ("Bun'ei 11, 20th day of the 10th month"), the Japanese defenders were pushed back from the several landing sites. In the ensuring skirmishes, the shrine was burned to the ground. When the shrine was reconstructed, a calligraphy "Tekikoku kōfuku" (敵国降伏) was put on the tower gate. The calligraphy was written by Emperor Daigo, dedicated by Emperor Daijo Kameyama to supplicated to defeat enemies who invade.
The shrine is highly ranked among the many shrines in Japan. It was listed in "Engishiki-jinmyōchō" (延喜式神名帳) edited in 927. In 11th century or 12th century, the shrine was ranked as "Ichinomiya" (一宮; first shrine) of Chikuzen Province. 
Admiral Heihachiro Togo, famous for defeating Russia on the seas, was known to worship often at Hakozaki shrine.
From 1871-1946, Hakozaki was officially designated a "Kanpei-taisha" (官幣大社), in the first rank of government supported shrines. Other similar Hachiman shrines were Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu of Yawata in Kyoto Prefecture and Usa Shrine of Usa in Ōita Prefecture.
Shinto belief.

Canopy Glow

Canopy Glow is the fourth full-length album recorded by the Chicago, Il, USA - based band, Anathallo. It was released on November 18, 2008 on CD and re-released on vinyl on May 26, 2009.
Background.
After the release of their 2006 album "Floating World", the band was offered a residency as the house band in a north Chicago neighborhood church called Berry United Methodist. A few members, worn out from the band's relentless tour schedule, chose not to relocate from Mt. Pleasant, Michigan. The remaining members, including vocalist Matt Joynt and multi-instrumentalist Bret Wallin, recruited replacements and began work on what would become "Canopy Glow".
By this point Anathallo had gained a reputation for unique instrumentals, orchestral arrangements, and as many as seven vocalists singing all at once. Having licensed a few songs from "Floating World" for television commercials, the band was financially secure enough to take a break from touring to write "Canopy Glow" at their own pace, using the church as their practice space. Female vocalist Erica Froman was brought on as a full-time member of the band at this time.
A lyric from "The River" lends the album its title. Matt Joynt recalls this story of Froman's mother during a hiking trip on the Pacific Crest Trail:
Though beginning with a song about Joynt's grandfather's funeral ("Noni's Field") and featuring this somewhat embellished account of a near-death experience Froman's mother endured, the album has a decidedly positive feel, reportedly influenced by the children seen through the church windows playing at the day care next door. 
The song "Bells" was inspired by a chance finding the band members came across while rehearsing in the church during the writing process for "Canopy Glow":
Recording.
The band entered Engine Music Studios in Chicago in the Fall of 2007 to begin tracking "Canopy Glow", with "friend-gineer" Neil Strauch directing the process. The band had experienced tension and stress while working on "Floating World" and were seeking a more relaxed envinronment to record in. Previous band member Andrew Dost, co-founder of the band fun. was called in as well as other friends and fellow musicians to contribute to the album bringing the total number of musicians to thirteen.
Cover art.
The band borrowed a portion of a painting called "Temma on Earth" by artist Tim Lowly for use as the cover art for the album. The art piece itself is a huge eight foot by twelve foot acrylic gesso with pigment on panel currently on display at the Frye Art Museum in Seattle, Washington.
Tim Lowly is married to pastor Sherrie Lowly from the Chicago church that Anathallo wrote the album in. Temma, the subject of the painting, is the Lowlys' daughter.

Wang Liping (Taoist)

Wang Liping, Daoist Name WANG Yong-sheng,法号"灵灵子", means "Lone Daoist". Born in June 1949 at the Mountain foot of the Liaoning Province Fushun City. He is the 18th generation transmitter of the Dragon Gate Taoism branch of Quanzhen School.
Introduction.
Wang Liping was taught and trained by three Daoist hermits—Zhang HeDao (Wu-Ji Daoist) who was the 16th generation and Wang JiaoMing (Yin-Ling Daoist) and Jia Jiaoyi (Song-Ling Daoist) who are 17th generation of Dragon Gate branch from Mount Lao of Shandong Province.

Grannie stone

The Grannie or Granny stone is either the only surviving part of a stone circle or a simple glacial erratic. It lies in the River Irvine below the Rivergate Centre in Irvine, North Ayrshire, Scotland. The Grannie Stane is clearly visible when the water is low. The GPS co-ordinates are .
Grannie stone.
The Grannie Stane (or Granny Stane) is described as "One of Irvine's prehistoric puzzles", this boulder is either a glacial erratic left behind from the Ice Age or is the last remaining stone of a stone circle - others were removed, by blasting in 1897 and 1899, after the Irvine weir was constructed in 1895, but popular protests saved this remaining stone. The weir raised the water level and the stone became therefore became less prominent. The stones had been on the upstream side of the old Irvine Bridge. It was also humorously known as 'Paddy's Milestone' after Ailsa Craig due to its supposed resemblance to that island.
Origin of the name.
There has been some speculation as to the origins of the name of the stone, the name may relate to Apollo Grannicus a Romano-British sun God, Grainaig, Grianaig, or Grian a Celtic god of the sea or Granos, the god of thermal springs, which is the most unlikely as there is no evidence of thermal springs in the area. McJannet relates that Grianaig was a goddess who was transformed into a grey boulder. Unfortunately the origins of the name and perhaps other insight that could be gained from folklore have been lost. A Granny stone still exists in Gourock, but on dry land.
Uses.
The stone may simply be a glacial erratic with no archaeological significance and it is not listed by the RCAHMS or mentioned by the outstanding local archaeologist in Victorian times, John Smith. It is not marked on the first edition of the Ordnance Survey map of Irvine.
The Puddlie Doodlie ford, the Puddleford, may have an interesting origin of the name is as 'holy steps' ('pas de Dieu'), the stepping stones by which the monks from the Carmelite Priory made their way to Church. Some of the stepping stones may have come from a group of stones later removed, of which the Granny Stane is the last survivor. Use of the Puddleford by horses was prohibited in 1836 to safeguard access to the Puddly Well, one of the public wells. Stepping stones are marked as recently as 1860 on the OS map of Irvine.
Strawhorn was of the opinion that the stone was part of a stone circle and also thought that some of the other stones were used in the construction of the Puddleford steps.
The Granny stone once served a significant role in the Carters Society's Marymass celebration as they formerly twice circled the stone on their way to the Irvine Moor. This was said to celebrate the crossing of the Irvine at this point by William Wallace in 1297 on his way to attack the English army. This suggests that the stone stood on dry land or in shallower water if the Carters walked round it, not unlikely as the weir built in 1895 had raised the water level.
The episode in 1297 relates to a punitive expedition under Sir Henry Percy sent to Irvine to quash an armed uprising against the dethronement of John Balliol. The Earl of Carrick, Robert Bruce and others led the Scottish army, however after much argument they decided to submit without a fight. The story became embellished with a purely fanciful involvement of William Wallace in a brave action here.
A persistent belief is that the River Irvine has changed its course and the area beneath the Saint Inan's church cemetery was once a green holm on which stood a stone circle with the Granny stone as the largest. The others are said to have been swept away by the river and later broken up as previously stated. An 1890s photograph shows the stone situated at a greater distance from the river bank than it is now.

The album was awarded 4½ stars by Lee Bloom in an Allmusic review which stated "This recording marks a period in his development prior to a stylistic shift away from bop and toward a stronger rhythm and blues emphasis... Overall, "Lou Takes Off" breaks no new musical ground, but it is a solid, swinging session of high-caliber playing. According to Donaldson, Blue Note initially didn't like any of the album, "the conga drums or the new musicians."

Wave-class oiler

The "Wave" class was a class of replenishment oilers built for service supporting the Royal Navy during the later years of the Second World War. They were subsequently transferred to the Royal Fleet Auxiliary after the end of the war, and went on to support British and allied fleet units in Cold War conflicts such as the Korean War.
Design and construction.
The expanding needs of the Royal Navy to carry out long range operations away from friendly fuelling and replenishment stations led to the ordering of a number of tankers of around displacement, able to carry of fuel oil. These would allow the Royal Navy and its allies increased flexibility, particularly in the Pacific theatre, where there were large expanses of water and few friendly fuel stations. A total of twenty ships were eventually built by three British yards; 12 by the Furness Shipbuilding Company, Haverton Hill-on-Tees, three by Harland and Wolff at their yard in Govan, and the remaining five by Sir J. Laing & Sons Ltd, at Sunderland.
Service.
Thirteen of the 20 of the ships were initially built for the Ministry of War Transport (MoWT), which assigned them to be operated by various merchant shipping lines. Consequently most were named with the standard MOWT prefix "Empire". The remaining MOWT owned oilers were transferred to the Royal Fleet Auxiliary in 1946 and all were given "Wave" names. Several of the RFA ships served in the Far East during the Second World War, while the class was heavily involved in the Korean War. RFAs "Wave Sovereign", "Wave Baron", "Wave Premier", "Wave Prince", "Wave Chief", "Wave Knight", "Wave Regent", "Wave Laird" and "Wave Conqueror" all served there in support of allied fleet units and task forces.
The class began to be retired from the Royal Fleet Auxiliary in the late 1950s, with "Wave Commander" and "Wave Liberator" the first to be sold for scrapping in 1959. Most of the remaining vessels had been scrapped by the mid-1960s, but refits and modifications allowed several to continue in service until the mid-1970s, with "Wave Chief" the last to be retired, in 1974.

Wedding for Disaster

"Wedding for Disaster" is the fifteenth episode of the twentieth season of "The Simpsons". It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 29, 2009. In the episode, Marge and Homer's second marriage turns out to be invalid, so they decide to get married again. Right before the re-marriage, Homer goes missing, and Bart and Lisa suspect that he has been kidnapped by Sideshow Bob. The episode was written by Joel H. Cohen and directed by Chuck Sheetz. It features a guest appearance by Kelsey Grammer as Sideshow Bob. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It was viewed by 6.58 million viewers in its original American broadcast.
The June 28, 2009 rerun of the episode featured a brief alternate opening. Following the death of Michael Jackson three days prior, on June 25, the music video for "Do the Bartman" was shown, followed by a title card in memory of Jackson, showing a still of his appearance as Leon Kompowsky (the big, bald mental patient who was put in the insane asylum for believing he really was Michael Jackson) from the episode "Stark Raving Dad".
Plot.
His Holiness the Parson, the head of the Presbylutheran denomination, tells Reverend Lovejoy that due to a lapsed ministerial certification various ceremonies he performed are invalid. This affects Homer and Marge, who turn out not to be married as they previously thought. Homer vows to give Marge the perfect wedding he did not give her either of the first two times they got married. Marge is thrilled to be able to plan her dream wedding, but it is not long before she turns into a Bridezilla, shooting down all of Homer’s ideas and mowing down everyone who gets in her way. The day of the wedding finally arrives, and everything is perfect except for one small detail — Homer is missing. At first it appears that Marge has driven him away, but Bart and Lisa stumble on a clue that leads them to believe their father was kidnapped: a keychain with the initials "S.B."
Meanwhile, Homer finds himself chained to a pipe in a dark room. A mysterious voice tells him that the key to unlock his chains is inside a lollipop, he frantically eats it only to discover the lollipop is made of fiery hot sauce. Homer's torments continue as Bart and Lisa race to save him. They first assume his captor "S.B." is Sideshow Bob (who had escaped from jail). However, it turns out he was innocent the whole time and had no involvement in Homer's kidnapping, thanks to an alibi from Krusty the Clown, who explained that Bob was with him the whole day the time Homer was kidnapped. Bob helps them figure out that the keychain actually belongs to their aunts, Patty and Selma Bouvier. Bart and Lisa soon realize that they intentionally kidnapped Homer out of spite for him and have planned to keep him cooped up until Marge forgets about him.
Feeling resigned to his fate, Homer reads the wedding vows he wrote for Marge to them. Patty and Selma soon have a change of heart after being touched by his wedding vows. Realizing how much Homer truly loves her, they release him, but not before Bart and Lisa catch up to them. With the keychain as proof of their misdeed, the kids comes inside the apartment and confront Patty and Selma for their actions. Bart and Lisa also blackmail their aunts by threatening to tell their mother the truth about their involvement in Homer's kidnapping unless the twins pay for their parents' remarriage ceremony. Patty and Selma reluctantly agree to do so, and Homer and Marge at last get married outside city hall.
Cultural references.
Homer's torture cell and its voice changer reference the "Saw" film series.
The title recalls the phrase "heading for disaster".
The Parson is modeled after singer and actor Bing Crosby. The singing the Parson does is a reference to Crosby's character as Father O'Malley in "Going My Way".
During a fight between Homer and Marge in front of Maggie, Homer calls Marge Bridezilla because of her behaviour during wedding preparation and arrangements, Maggie then imagines them as King Kong vs. Godzilla.
Reception.
"Wedding for Disaster" received a Nielsen rating of 3.7/6 and was viewed by 6.58 million viewers. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 7.3/10, saying, "'Wedding for Disaster' was one of those episodes that, while not knocking you down with laughter, was quite fun to watch." He went on to say, "it was also sweet to have Homer's recitation of his vows be the turning point for his sisters-in-law. Again, this wasn't a howlingly funny episode, but there were some great parts, and overall 'Wedding for Disaster' was a pleasant enough telling of Marge and Homer's third and fourth weddings."
Erich Asperschlager of TV Verdict wrote: "'Wedding for Disaster' worked because it had a cool mystery. Granted, I’m a sucker for mysteries, but some of the best Simpsons episodes are mysteries—and most of those feature Sideshow Bob. I was more than ready to let tonight’s episode turn into the next Sideshow Bob story, but I also like that they let him just be a cameo. Much as I love Kelsey Grammer’s scheming sidekick, he’s too smart to have kidnapped Homer for the reason Bart suspected: 'If Mom and Dad don’t get married, I’ll never be born!' The real solution made a lot more sense, and gave the ending a little more weight. 'Wedding for Disaster' may have been a little light on laughs compared to the last few episodes, but the story carried the day."
Awards.
Joel H. Cohen won a Writers Guild of America Award in the Animation category in 2010 for writing the episode.

Vicky Hurst

Vicky Hurst (born June 19, 1990) is an American professional golfer currently playing on the LPGA Tour. 
She turned professional as a 17-year-old in 2008, while still in high school. Playing on the Futures Tour that year, she won five times and set a Tour record for single season earnings with $93,107.
Childhood and family life.
Hurst was born to a golfing family. While pregnant with Vicky, her mother Koko, a native Korean, was completing a round of golf at Andrews AFB near Washington, D.C. when her water broke on the 16th hole. Although winning the round, Koko left to give birth to Vicky at the base's medical center. Her father, Joe, who met Koko while he was stationed in Korea in the 1980s, was a retired Air Force colonel. He died suddenly of a massive stroke in April 2006 while Vicky, age 15, was practicing for the LPGA Ginn Open to which she had received a sponsor exemption. Hurst withdrew from the tournament and said she would dedicate the rest of her career to her father's memory.
Hurst was raised in Melbourne, Florida, where she attended Holy Trinity Episcopal Academy and graduated in June 2008, part-way through her Futures Tour rookie year. She has an older sister, Kelly, also an accomplished golfer, was a member of the University of Florida golf team, though she never played.
Amateur career.
Hurst had a standout amateur career. In 2005 she won the Florida Women's State Golf Association Junior Girls' Championship, was named the FWSGA Junior Player of the Year and finished second at the Florida high school girls golf championship. In 2006 she was runner-up at the U.S. Girls' Junior and tied for second at the FWSGA Junior Girls' Championship. Also in 2006, she played in the U.S. Women's Open, less than two weeks after turning 16.
She was named Florida Junior Player of the Year in 2006-07 and qualified again for the U.S. Women's Open in 2007. In 2007 she won three American Junior Golf Association (AJGA) events, and earned spots on the 2007 U.S. PING Junior Solheim Cup Team and Canon Cup, representing the East Team. She ended 2007 as the top-ranked amateur in the Polo Golf Rankings and was named the 2007 AJGA Player of the Year.
Professional career.
In the fall of 2007 at the start of her senior year in high school, Hurst faced a choice between pursuing a college golf career, for which she was heavily recruited by coaches, and turning professional. She participated in, and won, the Futures Tour qualifying school in November. In December she announced that she would skip college and join the Futures Tour in 2008, while completing high school at the same time. She also received sponsor exemptions to three LPGA Tour events in 2008, missing the cut in two of the events and finishing tied for 21st in the third.
In 2008, she competed full-time on the Futures Tour, winning five times and setting a Tour record for single season earnings with $93,107. She was named Rookie of the Year and Player of the Year and automatically qualified for full playing status on the LPGA Tour for the 2009 season. Her first tournament as an LPGA member was the 2009 season-opening SBS Open at Turtle Bay at which she finished tied for 15th and led the field in driving distance. Hurst finished her rookie year leading the LPGA Tour in driving distance with an average distance of 272.5 yards.
Hurst's endorsement contracts include Callaway Golf and Under Armour.

Florida Gators women's tennis

The Florida Gators women's tennis team represents the University of Florida in the sport of tennis. The Lady Gators compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). They play their home matches in Linder Stadium on the university's Gainesville, Florida campus, and are currently led by head coach Roland Thornqvist. In the thirty-nine-year history of the Gators women's tennis program, the team has won twenty-five SEC championships and six NCAA national tournament championships.
History.
The origins of the Florida Gators women's tennis team date to 1960, when Florida undergraduate Alice Tym organized and led a successful intercollegiate women's tennis club team. As Title IX expanded opportunities for women in college sports, the University of Florida sponsored its first intercollegiate varsity women's tennis team in 1972–1973. In the early years of the program, the Lady Gators were a perennial top-ten team in the national championship tournaments sponsored by the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW), including a second-place finish in the 1980 AIAW tournament.
Since the NCAA began sponsoring national championships in women's sports in 1981–1982, the Lady Gators have won five NCAA team championships, four NCAA singles championships, and four NCAA doubles championships. In addition to their five NCAA team championships, the Lady Gators have also finished second in the NCAA national championships tournament seven times, including 1988, 1990, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2002 and 2010. As a team, the Gators have failed to qualify for the AIAW and NCAA national championship tournaments only three times (1973, 1986 and 2009).
The Gators have also dominated the Southeastern Conference, winning twenty-five conference championships and seventeen SEC tournament titles since the SEC sanctioned women's tennis as a conference sport in 1980.
Brandi era: 1985–2001.
Led by their fourth-year coach, Andy Brandi, the Florida Gators women's tennis team made its first appearance in the NCAA championship tournament finals in Los Angeles, California in 1988. The Lady Gators entered the tournament the top-seeded team, but were decisively upset by the Stanford Cardinal women's tennis team, five matches to two, in the final of the team championship. The Gators' No. 1 singles player, Shaun Stafford, was upset in the team championships, but recovered to win the individual NCAA singles championship by defeating her teammate Halle Cioffi in the championship final.
The Lady Gators hosted the NCAA national championship tournament on their home courts at Linder Stadium in Gainesville for the first time in 1990. Led by their top singles players, freshman Andrea Farley and junior Nicole Arendt, the second-seeded Gators battled to the championship finals before falling to the top-seeded Stanford Cardinal women, five matches to one.
The Gators won their first NCAA national team championship in Palo Alto, California in 1992. Led by star freshman Lisa Raymond, the Gators beat the Texas Longhorns women's tennis team five matches to three. Raymond also won the individual 1992 NCAA championship in singles.
In 1995, for the fourth time in eight seasons, the Lady Gators reached the championship finals of the NCAA tournament, held in Malibu, California. After blazing through the first three rounds of the tournament without losing a single match, the Texas Longhorns edged the Gators in the finals, five matches to four, in one of the most evenly matched championship finals ever held.
In 1996, Brandi's top-ranked and undefeated Gators earned their second NCAA team championship in Tallahassee, Florida. Lady Gators Jill Craybas, Dawn Buth, Lisa Pugliese and Stephanie Nickitas won their singles matches, and Craybas and Lori Ann Freedman won the doubles match, as the team decisively defeated the Stanford Cardinal women five matches to two. The Lady Gators' previous record against the Cardinal in NCAA tournament play was 0–3. Craybas also claimed the individual 1996 NCAA singles championship, and Buth and Nickitas won the 1996 NCAA doubles title—only the second time in NCAA history that a women's team won the national team, singles and doubles titles in the same season. The Gators finished the season 31–0 in team matches, and defeated twenty college teams ranked among the top twenty-five in the country.
The top-seeded Gators reached the championship finals of the NCAA tournament for the third straight year in 1997, before falling to the Stanford Cardinal, five matches to one, in Palo Alto.
Brandi's undefeated Lady Gators claimed their third NCAA team championship in 1998 by crushing the Duke Blue Devils women's tennis team, five matches to one, in South Bend, Indiana. Led by seniors Bonnie Bleecker and Stephanie Nickitas, the second-seeded Gators won the doubles match and four of the five singles matches in the tournament final.
At the 1999 NCAA tournament held in Gaiensville, the top-seeded Gators women's tennis team returned to the championship finals for the fifth consecutive season, but lost to its national rival, the Stanford Cardinal, five matches to two, for the fourth time since 1988.
During Brandi's seventeen-year tenure, three individual Gators won four NCAA singles championships: Shaun Stafford in 1988; Lisa Raymond in 1992 and 1993; and Jill Craybas in 1996. In NCAA doubles championship play, three Gators doubles teams have won four NCAA doubles championships: Jillian Alexander and Nicole Arendt in 1991; Dawn Buth and Stephanie Nickitas in 1996 and 1997; and Whitney Laiho and Jessica Lehnhoff in 2001.
Thornqvist era: 2002 to present.
In his first season the Lady Gators' new head coach, Roland Thornqvist returned the Gators to the finals of the 2002 NCAA championship tournament in Palo Alto, California. The top-seeded Gators faced the Stanford Cardinal women's tennis team for the second consecutive year in the NCAA tournament, and suffered the same fate: a 4–1 loss to the Cardinal.
The Gators won their fourth NCAA team championship in 2003, and their first under new head coach Roland Thornqvist, by defeating the top-ranked and defending NCAA champion Stanford Cardinal women's tennis team four matches to three in Gainesville. Gators Jennifer Magley and Zerene Reyes won the doubles match, with Julia Scaringe, Julie Rotondi and Alexis Gordon winning singles matches to clinch the 2003 team title. The Cardinal women had previously beaten the Gators to win the NCAA team championships in the two preceding seasons.
After failing to qualify for the NCAA tournament in 2009, and after a six-season absence from the NCAA tournament finals, the Gators returned to the championship match in Athens, Georgia 2010, once again facing their old nemesis, the Stanford Cardinal women. In a closely contested championship final, the Cardinal edged the Lady Gators, four matches to three. It was the Gators' seventh second-place performance in the NCAA championships (six of those championship losses at the hands of Stanford).
Thornqvist's Lady Gators claimed the program's fifth NCAA team championship in 2011 by defeating the No. 1 ranked Stanford Cardinal women's tennis team on Stanford's home courts in Palo Alto. Led by sophomore Lauren Embree in a dramatic come-from-behind third-set victory, the Gators defeated the Cardinal four matches to three, by taking the doubles match and singles matches by freshmen Alex Cercone and Olivia Janowicz. It was the third time the Gators defeated Stanford in the NCAA championship finals.
Year-by-year results.
Through the conclusion of the 2010–2011 season, the Lady Gators have compiled an overall win-loss record in dual matches of 875–128 (.872).
All-Americans.
Forty-one members of the Florida Gators women's tennis team have earned 101 All-American honors.

Illinois's 2nd congressional district special election, 1995

November 29, 1995 Democratic Primary
Sandi envisioned Jackson running for the 2nd congressional district seat in the Spring 1996 primary election. His father felt he should obtain experience at the local level as an alderman, Illinois State Senator or Illinois State Representative. Therefore, Jackson Sr. approached Alice J. Palmer with a deal where they supported her for Congress and she support Junior for her seat in the Illinois State Senate, but Jackson Jr. did not agree with that plan. He felt if Patrick Kennedy was ready at age 26, then at age 30 he was ready. After seeking approval from former Democratic National Committee Chairman and Chicagoan David Wilhelm, he decided to run for the seat. Palmer ran and endorsed Barack Obama for her old seat.
When Mel Reynolds, who was later convicted on sex misconduct charges, announced his resignation from the Congress on September 1, 1995, Jackson's name was (along with Palmer) one of the first names to surface as a replacement. On September 10, 1995, Jackson officially announced his candidacy. Five Democrats, including Illinois State Senate minority leader Emil Jones, and four Republicans competed in the November 29, 1995 party primaries for the party nominations in the December 12, 1995 general election. Jones was endorsed by Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. In addition to Jones, Jackson's toughest competitor, the Democratic field included Illinois State Senator Alice Palmer, Illinois State Representative Monique Davis and businessman John Morrow. Jackson used a combination of multimedia, targeted marketing and an army of community activists to deliver his positive campaign messages. He also registered thousands of new voters. Jackson received no endorsements from the downtown daily newspapers ("Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times", and the black daily, "Chicago Defender"), but was endorsed by the "Citizen, Daily Southtown", Markham, Illinois mayor, Evans Miller, and one local labor organization.
As part of his campaign he was the only candidate to embrace the third Chicago airport proposal being championed by Jim Edgar at the time. The proposed airport in Peotone, Illinois was in Will County and was outside of the congressional district (which then was entirely contained in Cook County), but with thousands of jobs that would result nearby, his region would be a large beneficiary. Jackson estimates the airport could bring the region nearly a quarter million jobs and with the multiplier effect on the economy the region would benefit by a half million jobs.
One of Jackson's most lasting memories from his first election came during a bipartisan televised debate. During Jackson's positive campaign, he had emphasized that his district would be better off keeping Jones in office at the state capital in Springfield and sending Jackson to Washington. Jones said that being a politician took more than crowd pleasing and rhyming. At the time, the Chicago Bulls had just lost the popular B. J. Armstrong in the 1995 Expansion draft to the Toronto Raptors and Michael Jordan had recently returned to basketball from playing minor league baseball. Jackson memorably stated, "I am not running against Emil Jones. I am trying to build a stronger team. B.J. should have never been traded; M.J. should have stayed in basketball; E.J. should stay in Springfield; and J.J. should be sent to Congress."
Jackson won the democratic party primary and since the district is overwhelmingly Democratic, he was the favorite for the special general election. The manner in which he won was interesting because although he lost two of the eleven city wards and three of the six townships, he won all the highest voter turnout regions (two largest townships and five largest wards) except the 34th ward, which was Jones' home base. The day after winning the primary, he received a congratulatory phone call from United States Vice President Al Gore who had also won his first election (representing Tennessee in the House of Representatives) in the shadow of his father, Albert Gore, Sr. who had represented Tennessee in Congress. 
On the eve of the election, Gore attended a Jackson address. Jackson was campaigning in a district where his father was well-known. During this campaign, his lone controversy was the fact that his salary as field director the Rainbow Coalition had been subsidized by the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union, which was accused by a Senate investigating committee of having ties to organized crime. Nothing ever came of those accusations.
Jackson won the general election against Republican Thomas Somer (76 percent to 24 percent). The victory had been widely anticipated. Upon his victory, Jackson made it known he would be a liberal voice in opposition to Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, and he was sworn in by Gingrich on December 15, 1995 before being introduced to the House by long-time Chicago congressman Sidney Yates. Jackson was perceived as less charismatic than his father and less credentialed than the Rhodes Scholar Reynolds, but his family pedigree was expected to help him open the doors that would enable him to serve the needs of his constituents effectively. In August 1996, Somer withdrew from a rematch leaving Jackson with no major party opposition. As a result, Jackson received 94% of the vote in the general election.
After being elected in the special general election, Jackson was one of many congressional politicians who received a donation from John Huang although Jackson did not know Mr. Huang. Jackson's donation was unexplained. Many recipients felt compelled to return the donations as a scandal erupted involving the true source of the funds. Eventually there was an Federal Bureau of Investigation and United States Department of Justice interrogation of Mr. Huang concerning irregularities which seemed to relate to Jackson and Bill Clinton. Mr. Huang's $1,000 contribution to Jackson's campaign was within legal limits and Jackson attributed Mr. Huang's desire to contribute to the national media attention his campaign's positive message received.

Impromptu (programming environment)

Impromptu is a Mac OS X programming environment for live coding. Impromptu is built around the Scheme language, which is a member of the Lisp family of languages. The source code of its core has been opened as the Extempore project.
Description.
The environment allows to make changes to a program at runtime, so variables and functions may be redefined and the changes take effect immediately. A programmer can also create and schedule code for future execution, as well as data events such as notes and graphics objects. Once an event is scheduled, execution continues. Looping is performed by using an idiom called "temporal recursion" which works by having a function asynchronously schedule a future call to itself as its final action.
The library allows communicating with Audio Units for audio synthesis, and with graphics layers such as QuickTime, Quartz, Core Image, OpenGL for video composition. Code written in Objective-C can be called from the editor, and also Objective-C frameworks can perform calls to the Scheme interpreter. 
Impromptu's Scheme interpreter was initially built from the TinyScheme 1.35 baseline, but it has been substantially modified since to better suit the live coding context. A real-time garbage collector, and Objective-C integration were added. Also, a new statically typed language called the "Extempore Language" has been integrated to the system. This language is syntactically Scheme-like, but semantically closer to C, and is designed for real-time sound synthesis and other computationally heavy tasks. It provides type inference and is compiled to machine language by LLVM.
Sample performance.
"A Study in Keith" is a live coding performance in Impromptu by Andrew Sorensen. The first two minutes (1:56) are silent, while the performer writes the program that will produce the introduction of the piece. From then on, he modifies the code on the fly to evolve the composition.
Extempore.
The core of Impromptu has been released as "Extempore" under a BSD style licence. It runs under both Linux and Mac OS X. The project is as of June 2011 at an early stage and is intended as a developer preview, not suited for end users. It includes the Scheme interpreter, the Extempore Language compiler and the scheduler. The bindings to Apple libraries are absent, but the environment can interface with dynamic libraries.

<doc id="21613981" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21613981" title="Tropical Storm Vicente (2005)">
Tropical Storm Vicente (2005)

Tropical Storm Vicente (international designation: 0516; JTWC designation: 16W) was a short-lived but deadly tropical storm which caused severe flooding in Vietnam and Thailand in September 2005.
Meteorological history.
Tropical Depression 16W formed 205 nautical miles (375 km) east-southeast of Dong Tac, Vietnam on the morning of September 16. It reached Tropical Storm strength overnight local time and was named Vicente, a Chamorro male name. Shortly after forming, Vicente interacted with a tropical disturbance west of Luzon and made a cyclonic loop. Vicente then absorbed the disturbance before passing just south of Hainan Island. Eventually, Vicente tracked into the Vietnam coast northwest of Huế on September 18 and gradually dissipated.
Preparations.
China.
On September 17, the Hong Kong Observatory issued a standby signal No.1 as the outer bands of Vicente brought showers and thunderstorms to Hong Kong. The signal was dropped the next day as the storm moved away from Hong Kong. Red flags were hoisted at numerous beaches due to the rough seas.
Vietnam.
Ahead of the storm, about 9,000 residents evacuated inland while others worked to protect the thousands of dykes along the shore.
Thailand.
In anticipation of severe flooding in the capital city of Bangkok, about 2,000 water pumps and 1.7 million sandbags were sent to prevent significant flooding and to minimize the flooding from nearby rivers. Large forklift trucks were sent to ten stations set up around the city to assist any large trucks which might run into trouble during the storm. An additional 130 smaller forklifts were provided to assist smaller vehicles. A total of 7 million sandbags were stockpiled for use around the country.
Impact.
China.
Tropical Storm Vicente brought showers and thunderstorms to southern China but had little impact. Rough seas produced by the storm caused the drownings of two swimmers in Ham Tin Wan of Sai Kung. The lowest pressure recorded was 1010.4 hPa (mbar) on September 17. The rough seas also led to a Chinese ship striking a reef. All 17 crew members were rescued.
Vietnam.
Vicente dropped heavy rains throughout Vietnam, notably peaking at 310 mm (12.2 in) in Sơn La, 198 mm (7.7 in) in Tam Đảo District, and 164 mm (6.4 in) in Hòa Bình. Upwards of 150 mm (5.9 in) fell within 30 hours in northern areas of the county. The rains led to increased water levels in the Thao River, which threatened to overflow and flood several villages. In Thanh Hóa Province, an estimated 1,600 homes collapsed and 9,700 dykes were damaged. Large expanses of rice fields were submerged in floodwaters. In Hà Tĩnh Province, a total of 3,500 homes were submerged by floodwaters and an additional 450 residences were evacuated. An additional 3,000 homes were damaged and 250 were destroyed in other areas throughout Vietnam. A landslide in Yên Bái Province killed three people and injured five others. Flooding destroyed a bridge in Duong Quy and inundated a newly built school. A boy in Quỳnh Lưu District was killed when a tree, knocked down by the storm, fell on him. A total of 40,000 hectares (98,842 acres) of farmland was lost due to the storm. Damages totaled to ₫55 billion (US$3.48 million). In all, at least 20 people were killed by the storm.
Thailand.
The remnants of Vicente dropped heavy rains over the drought-stricken areas of Thailand. One reservoir, which has a maximum capacity of 8 million cubic metres (282.5 million cubic feet), contained only 312,000 cubic metres (11 million cubic feet) of water. Following the storm, the reservoir gained 288,000 cubic metres (10.1 million cubic feet) of water. At least seven homes were inundated with mud due to the rains in Soi Siang Tai.

Svirzh Castle

Svirz Castle (, Svirz'kyi zamok) is a fortified aristocratic residence in Svirzh, Lviv Oblast, Ukraine. It was originally built by the Świrzski noble family in the 15th century. Inside the castle is a small church dating from 1546.
The stronghold was completely rebuilt in the 17th century at the behest of its new owner, Count Aleksander Cetner. It is believed that General Paweł Grodzicki was responsible for the modernisation of the castle's fortifications. 
Though surrounded on all sides by moats, lakes, and marshes, the fort was taken by the rebellious Cossacks on several occasions. In 1648, the Turks set it on fire; they were less successful during the Lwow raid of 1672.
The castle stood in ruins for many years. It was restored in 1907, only to be devastated by fire in 1914. Rebuilding and restoration have occurred on several occasions since.

Other People

Other People is a novel by British writer Martin Amis, published in 1981.
Plot.
Mary, an amnesiac young woman, wakes in a hospital and cannot remember who she is, what has happened to her, or even simple things such as how to blow her nose or what clouds are. She leaves the hospital and takes the name "Mary Lamb" after overhearing a nursery rhyme. Mary befriends a woman named Sharon, an alcoholic who seems well-meaning to the naïve Mary until she prostitutes her for money. After enduring painful sex, Mary smashes the man's mouth in once he passes out. She flees, coming into contact with a policeman named Prince, who knows about Mary's past.
Mary lives for a while with Sharon's parents, also alcoholics, but eventually she moves into a shelter for "fallen women." She receives a letter from Prince that includes a newspaper clipping concerning her before she lost her memory. Mary learns that her real name is Amy Hide and that her past was quite dark, a fact which causes Mary a great deal of distress. During her stay at the shelter, she gets a job as a waitress in a seedy café. With one exception, all of the male employees sexually harass her, but she does not understand the significance of their actions. The exception is Alan, a meek and highly insecure man who is deeply infatuated with Mary but does nothing to ward off the attentions of others. Mary meets Prince again, and she learns that Amy had asked someone to kill her. According to Prince, the failed killing was what had caused her amnesia. The man who did it is behind bars but due to be released.
When Alan and another coworker, the cocksure but illiterate Russ, find out where Mary lives, they are appalled and ask her to join them at their squat. Alan appears tortured by her presence and by the continued kisses and fondling she receives from other men, particularly Russ. To comfort him, Mary begins sleeping with Alan. This does not seem pleasant for either of them, and after a while Mary decides to break their relationship off. In response, Alan hangs himself.
Mary goes to see a man named Michael, whom she finds out she had dated before she lost her memory. Pretending to be Amy's cousin, she asks Michael about the things that Amy did to him. Amy, according to him, was abusive, vindictive, and unfaithful. She is escorted out of Michael's office by his assistant, Jamie, who takes pity on the shabby-looking Mary and invites her to live with him. Jamie is extremely wealthy, and he squanders his wealth largely on drugs and alcohol. Mary becomes infatuated with Jamie and is crushed when he does not return her affection. The two eventually begin a sexual relationship, but it is clear that Jamie does not return Mary's love.
After their relationship ends, Mary moves in with Prince and begins going by Amy. They slowly develop a relationship, one that is deeper than any other that Amy has experienced in the course of the novel. One night, Prince informs Amy that her would-be killer has been released, and that she must confront him. It is never directly revealed who the killer is, although it is implied to be Prince. The confrontation scene ends ambiguously—it is unclear if Mary is finally killed. The next scene recalls the opening lines of the novel, but it is not certain whether this is a recapitulation, an event that happened in Mary's past, or what occurred after the confrontation scene.
Style.
The book starts as a comedy, slips into a thriller, and ends a horror story.
Amis saw the novel as a kind of overall investigation. "Mary (the main character) doesn't know what her role is," Amis explained in 1981. "Because of this, men start questioning their own attitudes towards women, and even about themselves. When one's role is undermined, you begin to look at everything around you in a different light."
Though narrated in the third person, the book's descriptions seem to come from Mary's point of view; because the world around her is completely alien, the descriptions are often bizarre, childlike, and (particularly in the very beginning) somewhat difficult to understand. This can sometimes make for poignant tragic irony—it is often clear to the readers, but not to Mary, that other characters do not mean well. This is true, for example, of the scene where Sharon prostitutes Mary for money, or of the repeated scenes of sexual harassment that Mary endures at the café where she works.
Reception.
The book was well received in Britain and the United States. The writer J.G. Ballard called "Other People" "Powerful and electrifying... 'Other People' is a metaphysical thriller, Kafka reshot in the style of "Psycho"." Writing in Britain's The Guardian, poet, writer and critic Anthony Thwaite spoke the novel's "enormous confidence of address," continuing, "Other People is 'about' a descent into Hell, Hell being 'other people'-- it's a very strange and impressive performance." The Times found "For all its savagery... Other People is a funny book... an achievement light years ahead of his earlier novels." Judy Dempsey wrote in The Irish Times, "Amis has done something important in 'Other People.'" In the Los Angeles Times, Charles Champlin called Amis "an English literary celebrity who, like Norman Mailer and Truman Capote here, finds himself in the columns more often than some film stars," and found the book, "an ingenious and mischievous piece of writing, nothing like a mystery with a tidy ending...a tour de force."
Composition.
Other People is the first book Amis completed after choosing to become a full-time fiction-writer; he had been on-staff at the New Statesman until 1979. Amis told an interviewer "I wanted to leave to devote myself to full-time writing. It was the responsibility of doing something else, not wholly connected with my writing that exhausted me from writing what I wanted. I enjoyed it, but I felt writing was more important."

Nano-campaigning

Nano-campaigning refers to an approach within Marketing communications, Public relations and Lobbying which uses personalised and product-specific or issue-specific tactics as the starting point for more extensive strategic campaigns. It is based on the principles of social psychology and is enabled by the application of social media technologies.
First use of the term.
The term was first coined by US marketer and blogger, Anne Holland, on her MarketingSherpa blog, in an article [http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article.php?ident=30857] of 6 October 2008. For Holland, the nano-campaign was the practical effect of the nano-niche marketing concept.
Wider definition and application of the term.
On 19 February 2009, UK campaigns consultant and writer, Dan Fox, in an article on PubAffairs, the Public Affairs Networking blog [http://www.publicaffairsnetworking.com/blog_detail.php?id=58], expanded the definition to cover the broader range of communications disciplines and services.
He defined nano-campaigning as the tactical promotion of ideas and messages, tailored to individuals or select groups, with the strategic aim of encouraging a campaign to grow and build momentum beyond a small, focussed audience, enabled by the multiplying effects of communication technologies and social media.
In March 2009, the term was used on another marketing blog, dm horizons [http://dmhorizons.blogspot.com/] to describe the rejection of television by the team campaigning to promote the Indian-manufactured budget car, the Nano, in favour of, "inter alia", chatrooms, news tickers, pop-ups, Facebook, Orkut, blogs, and word-of-mouth. dm horizons described this as "a nano-campaign for the Nano".

Pomoriany Castle

Pomoriany Castle () is a ruined castle in the village of Pomoriany, Zolochiv District, Lviv Oblast, Ukraine. It originated in the 16th century as a well-fortified noble residence on the bank of the Zolota Lypa River. The castle's early owners included Mikolaj Świnka and Jan Sienieński. 
The estate suffered badly at the hands of the Cossacks and Turks (1675, 1684) but Jan III Sobieski invested in the restoration in order to make Pomorzany one of his country residences. Sobieski's death in 1696 was followed by another long period of decline. 
A real change came about in the castle's fortunes when, in 1789, Erasm Pruszyński started transforming the dilapidated building into a modern residence. He had the barbican gate, three towers and several wings of the old structure torn down, however. 
As recently as 1939, Pomorzany was owned by the famous Potocki family. Following the September Campaign, the building was adapted for use as a school, but it was finally abandoned to rot in the late 1970s.

Eosinophilic cellulitus (also known as "Wells' syndrome" from George Crichton Wells who first described it) is a skin condition characterized by plaques that resemble cellulitis. Eosinophilic Cellulitis is of unknown etiology, though it is suspected to have an allergic and/or autoimmune component. There are documented cases of it being caused by flea (and other insect) bites and has been seen in conjunction with Churg-Strauss disease, though many cases are considered idiopathic. It has recently been added to the raredisease.org database. Typical treatment is with prednisone.

SM UB-14

SM "UB-14" was a German Type UB I submarine or U-boat in the German Imperial Navy () during World War I. The submarine was also known by the Austro-Hungarian Navy designation of SM "U-26".
"UB-14" was ordered in October 1914 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in November. "UB-14" was a little under in length and displaced between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck-mounted machine gun. "UB-14" was broken into sections and shipped by rail to the Austrian port Pola for reassembly. She was launched and commissioned in March 1915 as SM "UB-14" in the German Imperial Navy under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Heino von Heimburg.
Because Germany and Italy were not yet at war when "UB-14" entered service, she was transferred in name only to the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The submarine retained her German captain and crew, and remained under German command as a part of the "Kaiserliche Marine"s Pola Flotilla. During her first patrol in the Adriatic, "UB-14" torpedoed and sank the . While traveling to Constantinople (present-day Istanbul) to join the Constantinople Flotilla, "UB-14" attacked two British troopships, sinking with heavy loss of life, and seriously damaging . All three of "UB-14"s first victims were among the largest ships attacked by U-boats during the war.
Although "UB-14" sank the British submarine in the Sea of Marmara in November 1915, she spent most of the rest of her career patrolling in the Black Sea. The U-boat had only limited success there, sinking only three ships through the end of the war. After the war ended, the submarine was disarmed at Sevastopol and surrendered at Malta in November 1918. "UB-14" was broken up in 1920.
Design and construction.
After the German Army's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I, the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders. Project 34, a design effort begun in mid-August 1914, produced the Type UB I design: a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled. Constrained by railroad size limitations, the UB I design called for a boat about long and displacing about with two torpedo tubes.
"UB-14" was part of the initial allotment of seven submarines—numbered to —ordered on 15 October from AG Weser of Bremen, just shy of two months after planning for the class began. "UB-14" was laid down by Weser in Bremen on 9 November. As built, "UB-14" was long, abeam, and had a draft of . She had a single Körting 4-cylinder diesel engine for surface travel, and a single Siemens-Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel, both attached to a single propeller shaft. Her top speeds were , surfaced, and , submerged. At more moderate speeds, she could sail up to on the surface before refueling, and up to submerged before recharging her batteries. Like all boats of the class, "UB-14" was rated to a diving depth of , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds.
"UB-14" was armed with two torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes. She was also outfitted for a single machine gun on deck. "UB-14"s standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men.
Launching and commissioning.
Most of the UB I boats were shipped to their port of operations by rail, where they were assembled, launched, tested, and commissioned. Information on "UB-14" suggests that she may not have followed that pattern as closely as most other boats. According to several sources, "UB-14" was launched on 23 March 1915, and commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM "UB-14" on 25 March under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Heino von Heimburg a 25-year-old first-time U-boat commander. Those same sources are silent on "UB-14"s whereabouts at the time, but information on "UB-14" later shipment and arrival in the Mediterranean suggest that her initial launch and commissioning may have occurred in Germany.
"UB-14" was shipped by rail in June to the main Austrian naval base at Pola, with an arrival date on the 12th. The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down into what was essentially a knock down kit. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway flatcars. German engineers and technicians that accompanied earlier UB I boats to Pola worked under the supervision of Kapitänleutnant Hans Adam, head of the U-boat special command (). Typically, the UB I assembly process took about two to three weeks.
While "UB-14" made her way to Austria-Hungary, von Heimburg and his German crew were assigned to "UB-15" at Pola. The submarine was temporarily commissioned into the German Imperial Navy before a subsequent transfer to the Austro-Hungarian Navy as its . Von Heimburg and his German crew, with one Austrian officer aboard, gained valuable experience in "UB-15"/"U-11", sinking the on that U-boat's first patrol. "UB-15"/"U-11" was handed over to the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 16 June, and von Heimburg and his crew were transferred intact on 21 June to "UB-14", which was still a few days from completion.
At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Italy had declined to join its Triple Alliance partners—Germany and Austria-Hungary—in declaring war against the Entente Powers, and opted to remain neutral. Pressure from the United Kingdom and France swayed Italy to sign the secret 1915 Treaty of London on 26 April, in which Italy promised to leave the Triple Alliance and declare war against its former allies within a month in return for territorial gains after the end of the war. Because Italy initially declared war only on Austria-Hungary, Germany and Italy were not officially at war. As a consequence, German submarines operating in the Adriatic and the Mediterranean were all assigned Austrian numbers and flew the flag of Austria-Hungary when making attacks on Italian vessels; "UB-14" was assigned the designation of "U-26" and entered onto the rolls of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, despite the fact that she remained completely under German control. According to historian Lawrence Sondhaus, this dual numbering system reflected the close submarine cooperation between the two countries and still makes it difficult to distinguish between submarines of the two navies.
On 1 July, "UB-14" joined the Pola Flotilla (), and departed soon thereafter on her first patrol. On the night of 6/7 July, Italian armored cruisers that had recently been deployed at Venice undertook a "reconnaissance in force" off Pola in an attempt to discourage future Austrian sorties against the Italian coast. When the Italian ships retired in the early morning hours of the 7th, "UB-14" was about off Venice. At dawn, the armored cruiser crossed paths with "UB-14" and was torpedoed. "Amalfi" quickly began listing to port and sank within 30 minutes with the loss of 67 men. At displacement, "Amalfi" was one of the largest ships sunk by U-boats during the war. "UB-14" escaped the scene without damage.
Aegean Sea.
Enver Pasha and other Turkish leaders had been pleading with their German and Austrian allies to send submarines to the Dardanelles to help attack the British and French fleet pounding Turkish positions. As part of the German response, "UB-14" was ordered to Constantinople (present-day Istanbul) to join ; sister boats and ; and the UC I boats and in the Constantinople Flotilla (). Since her intermediate refueling stop at Bodrum was beyond her limited range, "UB-14" departed Pola under tow from an Austrian destroyer on 15 July 1915. "UB-14"s engine and gyrocompass broke down while off Crete, leaving the boat dead in the water for a time, but temporary repairs by the crew enabled the boat to make Bodrum on the 24th. A repair crew from Constantinople was dispatched—having to travel by train and camel just to reach "UB-14"—and the ship was ready to resume her journey on 13 August.
Shortly after departing Bodrum, "UB-14" had just cleared the Greek island of Kos and was off the nearby island of Kandeloussa when von Heimburg sighted several potential victims. The first ship seen was the British hospital ship , headed to Alexandria from the Dardanelles. Von Heimburg, seeing the properly identified hospital ship, allowed "Soudan" to pass unmolested. The next ship was not so lucky, however. It was the unescorted , a Canadian ocean liner pressed into troopship duties. "Royal Edward" was headed in the opposite direction from "Soudan": from Alexandria to the Dardanelles with reinforcements for the British 29th Infantry and a small group with the Royal Army Medical Corps, all of whom were destined for Gallipoli. Von Heimburg launched one of his two torpedoes from about a mile (2 km) away and hit "Royal Edward" in the stern; the ship sank stern-first in six minutes, with a large loss of life. "Soudan" and several other ships were able to rescue nearly 700 men, but over 900 died. "Royal Edward", at , was also among the largest ships hit by U-boats during the war. While evading the rescue ships, which included two French destroyers, "UB-14"s compass broke down again, forcing a return to Bodrum on the morning of the 15th.
After repairs were completed at Bodrum, "UB-14" continued on her way with a passenger, Prince Heinrich XXXVII Reuss of Köstritz (of the Reuss Junior Line) who needed passage to Constantinople. During the journey north, "UB-14" came upon another fully loaded troopship near the island of Efstratis, about from Lemnos. At 09:51 on 2 September, von Heimburg launched a single torpedo at the British troopship , which was carrying mostly Australian troops headed for Gallipoli. The torpedo scored a hit on the starboard bow of the liner, which immediately began to list in that direction. As the men boarded lifeboats to abandon ship, another torpedo narrowly missed the stricken ship. The British seaplane carrier sped to the scene of the attack, and rescued nearly 700 men from the water. The hospital ship was also on the scene and rescued a sizable number. A group of about 40 volunteers stayed on board "Southland" to help the crew, and with some towing assistance from "Ben-my-Chree", were able to beach the ship on Lemnos. In all, fewer than 40 men died in the attack; among "Southland"s survivors was James Martin, who, upon his death less than two months later, became the youngest Australian known to have died in the war. The stricken ship had received serious damage, but was later repaired and returned to service. As with "UB-14"s first two targets, "Southland" was also the largest ships hit by U-boats, giving von Heimburg and "UB-14" three victims from the list of the largest in their first three attacks.
After the attack on "Southland", "UB-14" broke down again and put in at Chanak to await repairs. While there on 4 September, word came of the British submarine entangled in Turkish antisubmarine nets off Nagara Point. Von Heimburg, Prince Heinrich, and "UB-14"s cook, a man by the name of Herzig, set out in a rowboat to observe the Turkish attempts to destroy "E7". After several mines that formed part of the net had been detonated to no avail, von Heimburg and his group rowed out and repeatedly dropped a plumb line until it contacted metal. Then, von Heimburg dropped a Turkish sinker mine with a shortened fuse right on top of "E7". After the hand-dropped mine detonated too close for the British submarine's captain's comfort, he ordered his boat surfaced, abandoned, and scuttled. Between shellfire from the Turkish shore batteries and "E7"s scuttling charges, von Heimburg and company narrowly escaped harm. While most sources credit "E7"s sinking to the Turkish efforts, author Robert Stern contends that von Heimburg and "UB-14" deserve partial credit for the demise of "E7".
Black Sea.
After "UB-14"s repairs were completed, she continued on to Constantinople and, from there, began a patrol in the Black Sea on 3 October. During this patrol, von Heimburg torpedoed the 474-ton Russian steamer "Katja" about northwest of Sevastopol on the 7th, and "Apscheron", a Belgian steamer expropriated by the Imperial Russian Navy, south of Cape Chersonesos on the 8th. After her return to Constantinople on the 19th, "UB-14" was prepared for another patrol in the Black Sea. Just before her scheduled departure, however, the U-boat's destination was changed from the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara and von Heimburg and "UB-14" headed south on 5 November. While "UB-14" had been in port on 30 November, Turkish forces had captured the before the submarine or any of the confidential papers on board could be destroyed. When "Turquoise" was caught, her commander had not signaled her predicament to anyone, so a scheduled rendezvous with the British submarine —as far as anyone other than "Turquoise" or the Germans and Turks knew—was still on. "UB-14" had been sent to keep the rendezvous, reportedly going so far as to radio messages in the latest British code. Upon arriving at the designated location, "UB-14" surfaced and fired a torpedo at "E20" from a distance of . Only when "E20"s crew saw the torpedo did they realize something was amiss, but it was too late to avoid the weapon. The torpedo hit "E20"s conning tower and sank the submarine with the loss of 21 men. "UB-14" rescued nine men, including "E20"s captain who, reportedly, had been brushing his teeth at the time of the attack.
In December, von Heimburg was replaced as "UB-14"s commander by Kapitänleutnant Albrecht von Dewitz, but in early February 1916, von Heimburg resumed command. "UB-14"s activities between November and May are not reported in sources, but Paul Halpern reports that "UB-14" patrolled in the Black Sea off Trebizond from late May to early June, returning to Constantinople without success.
On 17 June, von Heimburg was recalled to Germany to command the soon-to-be-commissioned , and was replaced on "UB-14" by Kapitänleutnant Kurt Schwarz, a first time U-boat commander. Soon after Schwarz assumed command, "UB-14" was in the Black Sea in support of a July sortie by the German battlecruiser and the light cruiser in the eastern Black Sea. Because the Russian fleet, headquartered at Sevastopol, might have an opportunity to cut off the German warships on the mission, "UB-14" was sent on station off Sevastopol. When the Russian fleet did sortie, Schwarz attempted to torpedo the , but was seen and driven off by Russian dreadnought's screen of destroyers.
After Romania joined the war on the side of the Triple Entente in August and was quickly overrun by the Central Powers, the Russian efforts in the Black Sea in the second half of 1916 were focused in the west. Because German submarines never really accomplished all that much in the Black Sea, the February 1917 resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare led the Germans to temporarily abandon the Black Sea in lieu of the more target-rich Mediterranean. "UB-14"s whereabouts and activities during the latter half of 1916 and the first few months of 1917 are unreported in sources.
On 28 May 1917, "Oberleutnant zur See" Ernst Ulrich replaced Schwarz, and, soon after, "UB-14" sailed on the first German patrol of the year in the Black Sea. On 5 June, "UB-14" sank the 155-ton Russian sailing vessel "Karasunda" north of Poti; "Karasunda" was the last ship credited to "UB-14". Other than to note that "Oberleutnant zur See" Bodo Elleke succeeded Ulrich in March 1918, there is no mention in sources of "UB-14"s activities between June 1917 and November 1918.
After the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Central Powers on 3 March 1918, exiting the war, forces of the Central Powers surrounded and later seized the port of Sevastopol. "UB-14" was at Sevastopol after the Germany signed the armistice treaty that ended all fighting on 11 November. "UB-14" and the three other surviving Constantinople Flotilla boats were disarmed on 25 November. "UB-14" was scuttled in the Black Sea off Sevastopol in the early months of 1919.

Shamsi Airfield

Shamsi Airfield, also known as Bhandari Airstrip, is an airfield situated about 200 miles (320 km) southwest of Quetta and about 248 miles (400 km) northwest of Gwadar in the Balochistan province of Pakistan. The airfield is located in Washuk District and nestled in a barren desert valley between two ridges of the Central Makran Range approximately 21 miles (35 km) southeast of the village of Washuk.
Shrouded in secrecy, Shamsi was leased by Pakistan to the United Arab Emirates in 1992 for game hunting purposes and, between 20 October 2001 and 11 December 2011, it was leased to the United States for use as a base for joint Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and United States Air Force (USAF) surveillance and drone operations (particularly those involving Predator drones) against militants in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas. The United States was ordered to vacate the airfield by the Pakistani Government on 26 November 2011 after the Salala Incident in which US-led NATO forces attacked two Pakistani border checkposts in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas killing 24 Pakistan Army soldiers. The United States vacated the airfield on 11 December 2011.
History.
Lease by the United Arab Emirates (1992-2001).
The disused Bhandari Airstrip was leased to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) by the Government of Pakistan in 1992 for game hunting, particularly that of falconry and rare Bustards in Balochistan province, by members of the UAE royal families. The airstrip, which was renamed "Shamsi" (meaning "Sunny" in Arabic) by the Emirati Sheikhs, was developed into a jet capable airfield by the UAE.
Lease by the United States (2001-2011).
At the request of the United States, Shamsi was sub-leased by the UAE to the United States on 20 October 2001 with the approval of then Pakistani Government of President Pervez Musharraf and was further developed jointly by the CIA and the USAF as a military airfield. The US constructed two permanent and one portable hangars at Shamsi for housing drones, in addition to support and residential facilities, and recarpeted the asphalt runway to enable its use by large and heavy military aircraft. 
On the night of 9 January 2002, a United States Marine Corps KC-130R refuelling aircraft crashed after hitting a ridgeline on approach to Shamsi, possibly due to crew disorientation, resulting in the deaths of all seven crew members on board. 
In February 2009, "The Times" (London) claimed that it had obtained Google Earth images from 2006 that showed Predator drones parked outside a hangar at the end of the runway at Shamsi. The "Times" investigation was in response to a statement by US Senator Dianne Feinstein that the CIA was basing its drone aircraft in Pakistan. The U.S. company Blackwater was also reported to have a presence there, hired by the government to arm the drones with missiles. The Pakistani Government had initially denied that the airfield was being used as a base for US military or covert operations but confirmed the same later. "The New York Times" cited a senior Pakistani military official as saying that in 2009 the drone operations were moved across the border to Afghanistan.
U.S. friction with Pakistan and eviction (2011).
On 13 May 2011, following the Abbotabad Incident of 2 May 2011, Air Chief Marshal Rao Qamar Suleman, Chief of the Air Staff, Pakistan Air Force (PAF) confirmed, in an in-camera briefing to a joint sitting of the Pakistani Parliament, that Shamsi was not under the control of the PAF, but under UAE control. 
In June 2011, Pakistan publicly ordered the US to remove all its personnel from the airfield. The United States and Pakistan announced a few days later that drone operations from the airfield had actually ceased in April 2011.
On 26 November 2011, Pakistan ordered the United States to vacate the base within 15 days in response to the Salala Incident, in which US military aircraft attacked two Pakistani border checkposts 2.5 km inside Pakistani territory and killed 24 Pakistani troops. Although drone operations originating at the base had ceased in April 2011, the US was apparently still using the airfield for emergency landings and logistical support.
On 4 December 2011, the first US military aircraft arrived at Shamsi to evacuate US military personnel and equipment. A total of seven US military aircraft, including C-17 Globemasters, landed at Shamsi in the coming week for evacuation purposes and US equipment and personnel were evacuated in 30 sorties. On 9 December 2011, soldiers of Pakistan's Frontier Constabulary arrived at the nearby village of Washuk to position themselves to retake Shamsi. All roads to and from Shamsi were closed. Some US equipment was destroyed by the US military. The US finally vacated Shamsi on 11 December 2011 with two flights carrying the remaining US soldiers and equipment. Soldiers of the Pakistan Army, the Frontier Constabulary and officials of Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority immediately took control of the airfield. A photograph of the airfield taken on 11 December 2011 and officially released by the Pakistani military's Directorate of Inter-Services Public Relations and published in the British "The Telegraph" newspaper shows Pakistan Army soldiers and a Pakistan Army Mil Mi-17 helicopter at Shamsi shortly after the US vacated the airfield.

Clelia Duel Mosher

Clelia Duel Mosher (KLEEL-ya DUE-el MOE-sher) (December 16, 1863 – December 21, 1940) was a physician, hygienist and women's health advocate who disapproved of Victorian stereotypes about the physical incapacities of women. Her Master's degree thesis disproved the then widely held belief that women were physically inferior to men because they could only breathe costally, showing instead it was only women’s fashionable corset clothing of the time that prevented diaphragmatic breathing. She found that women would breathe with their diaphragm with enough exercise. Her next research was on menstruation, gathering data from 2,000 women over 12,000 menstrual cycles. She revealed unhygienic habits that caused painful menstruation and created the Mosher breathing exercise, making her possibly the first American physician to advocate core-body-strength-increasing exercises to reduce the pain of menstrual cramps.
Her most famous work, published posthumously, was a survey that she began in 1892 as an undergraduate when preparing to lecture on the "Marital Relation" before the Mother's Club of the University of Wisconsin, and continued throughout her career. It is the only known existing survey of Victorian women's sexual habits, and was initially controversial because of its frankness and the overwhelmingly sex-positive views of the participants, even including the use of "male sheaths" (now called condoms) and "rubber cap over the uterus" (either a diaphragm or cervical cap) birth control. All this stood in high contrast to other existing historical literature of the time which held that women have no sexual desires and sex should only be used for reproduction. One theory is because the researcher was a woman gathering data from women that knew the results would only be put forth before a purely female audience, the normal strictures of propriety of that time were let down and more realistic data was actually gathered.

Mosher attended Wellesley College, the University of Wisconsin, and Stanford University, where she received a bachelor's degree in zoology in 1893. In 1894, she received a master's degree from Stanford. In 1896, Mosher became a student at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. After her graduation as a doctor of medicine, she worked in private practice, until she became an assistant professor of personal hygiene at Stanford in 1910.

SM UB-9

SM "UB-9" was a German Type UB I submarine or U-boat in the German Imperial Navy () during World War I. "UB-9" was ordered in October 1914 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in November. "UB-9" was a little under in length and displaced between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck-mounted machine gun. She was launched and commissioned as SM "UB-9" in February 1915.
"UB-9"s commanding officer at commissioning only remained in charge of the ship for a week. Sources do not report any more commanding officers assigned through the end of the war, so it's not clear if the submarine remained in commission. "UB-9" was reported in use as a training vessel at Kiel in September 1915. The U-boat made no war patrols and sank no ships during the war, which may indicate that the vessel remained in a training role. At the end of the war, "UB-9" was deemed unseaworthy and unable to surrender at Harwich with the rest of Germany's U-boat fleet. She remained in Germany where she was broken up by Dräger at Lübeck in 1919.
Design and construction.
After the German Army's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I, the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders. Project 34, a design effort begun in mid-August 1914, produced the Type UB I design: a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled. Constrained by railroad size limitations, the UB I design called for a boat about long and displacing about with two torpedo tubes.
"UB-9" was the first of the initial allotment of seven submarines—numbered up to —ordered on 15 October from AG Weser of Bremen, just shy of two months after planning for the class began. "UB-9" was laid down by Weser in Bremen on 6 November. As built, "UB-9" was long, abeam, and had a draft of . She had a single Körting 4-cylinder diesel engine for surface travel, and a single Siemens-Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel, both attached to a single propeller shaft. Her top speeds were , surfaced, and , submerged. At more moderate speeds, she could sail up to on the surface before refueling, and up to submerged before recharging her batteries. Like all boats of the class, "UB-9" was rated to a diving depth of , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds.
"UB-9" was armed with two torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes. She was also outfitted for a single machine gun on deck. "UB-9"s standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men. After work on "UB-9" was complete at the Weser yard, she was launched on 6 February 1915.
Career.
The submarine was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM "UB-9" on 18 February 1915 under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Wilhelm Werner, a 26-year-old first-time U-boat commander. Wenninger was only in command of "UB-9" for ten days. Sources do not indicate who, if anyone, succeeded him as commander of "UB-9", or if "UB-9" remained in commission.
According to authors R. H. Gibson and Maurice Prendergast, "UB-9" had been assigned to the Kiel Periscope School by September 1915. Uboat.net reports that "UB-9' undertook no war patrols and had no successes against enemy ships, which may indicate that the vessel remained in use only as a training vessel.
At the end of the war, the Allies required all German U-boats to be sailed to Harwich for surrender. "UB-9" was one of eight U-boats deemed unseaworthy and allowed to remain in Germany. "UB-9" was broken up by Dräger at Lübeck in 1919.

CHELPG

CHELPG (CHarges from Electrostatic Potentials using a Grid based method) is an
atomic charge calculation scheme developed by Breneman and Wiberg, in which atomic charges are fitted to reproduce the molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) at a number of points around the molecule.
The charge calculation methods based on fitting of molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) (including CHELPG) are not well-suitable for the treatment of larger systems, where some of the innermost atoms are located far away from the points at which the MESP is computed. In such a situation, variations of the innermost atomic charges will not lead to significant changes of the MESP outside of the molecule, which means accurate values for the innermost atomic charges are not well-determined by the MESP outside of the molecule. It should be remembered that atomic charges depend on the molecular conformation. The representative atomic charges for flexible molecules hence should be computed as average values over several molecular conformations. A number of alternative MESP charge schemes have been developed, such as those employing Connolly surfaces or geodesic point selection algorithms, in order to improve rotational invariance by increasing the point selection density and reducing anisotropies in the sampled points on the MESP surface.
CHELPG charges can be computed using the popular "ab initio" quantum chemical packages such as Gaussian and GAMESS-US.

Flône Abbey

The Abbey of Flône, Belgium, is located on the banks of the Meuse River at Flône (Amay), in the province of Liège (Belgium). It was founded in 1075. 
In 1075, three lay brothers decided to devote themselves to the religious life and established themselves on land donated by Henry I of Verdun, Bishop of Liège, near the village of Flône. The site would serve as a convenient resting-place for travelers on the Tongres-Amay-Arlon road, and the lay brothers built a water mill and an oratory dedicated to Saint Matthew.
In 1189, the site became an abbey and became associated with the order of the Augustinian regular canons. A brewery was established in 1550 during the administration of Abbot Philippe d'Orjo (d. 1555), whose tomb is conserved in the church. In 1568, the abbey was plundered and destroyed by the Calvinist troops of William the Silent.
Thomas de Vinalmont (1608–1623) built the dovecote, porch, and mill, and under the Abbot Guillaume de Hemricourt (1636–1670) and his nephew Abbot Dieudonné de Hemricourt (1670–1692), the church, convent, and "tour d'angle" (junction tower) were built, the last of which became the emblematic image of the old abbey. These buildings formed a double court, at the center of which can be found the church of Saint-Matthieu. The Church of Saint-Matthieu, formerly the abbey church and now the parish church of Flône, contains five tombstones, of black marble, dedicated to various prelates of Flône; 17th century baptismal fonts; 17th century choral stalls; and two tableaux by Jean Del Cour (1631–1707) on the walls of the apse. These tableaux depict Saint Matthew and St. Augustine of Hippo. The church also contains a pipe organ built in 1710 by Karel Dillens. The church also contains a reliquary associated with the remains associated with St. Denise, an early Christian martyr. The relics are visible through small openings; in the modern era this saint is invoked for protection against bicycle and motorcycle accidents and headaches. 
Denise's relics were brought to the Abbey of Flône in 1922, and a vase associated with the saint contains her crystallized blood. A second vase contains earth said to have been drenched with the blood of Christian martyrs. On the sarcophagus is embedded a marble tablet said to come from Roman catacombs; it carries the inscription: "DIONISE, V.M..I.IN.P VIX. AN. XXIX." (Denise, celebrated virgin martyr rests in peace. She lived 29 years). 
In the 18th century, Jean-Jerome de Schroots (1725–1742) added a tithe house ("maison de la dîme") and his successor Charles Delvaux de Fenffe rebuilt the abbatial palace. 
Flône acquired a vast domain and the rights associated with its lands, which included various farms and privileges regarding forests and fisheries. 
In 1796, control of the abbey was assumed by the French revolutionary authorities; its lands and goods were confiscated and sold to private individuals.
In 1921, the order known as the Ladies of Christian Education ("Dames de l'instruction chrétienne") acquired Flône Abbey and made it their principal house. A boarding school for young girls was opened at the abbey. The institution later introduced co-education. A footbridge was built, which connected it with Château Goffart (built in 1905). There was a fire at the abbey in December 2007, which damaged some of the old woodwork. In 2008, the elementary school at the abbey had more than 400 pupils; there were 800 pupils at the secondary level.

Robert Reynolds Macintosh

Sir Robert Reynolds Macintosh (17 October 1897, Timaru, New Zealand – 28 August 1989, Oxford, England) was a New Zealand-born anaesthetist. He was the first professor of anaesthetics outside the United States.
Early life.
Macintosh was baptised with the Maori name Rewi Rawhiti. He was the youngest son of Charles Nicholson Macintosh, newspaper editor and mayor of Timaru in 1901, and his wife, Lydia Beatrice Thompson. He spent part of his childhood in Argentina, but returned to New Zealand when he was thirteen years old. He was educated at Waitaki Boys' High School, where he was head of school and excelled academically and athletically.
In December 1915, he travelled to Britain and was commissioned in the Royal Scots Fusiliers, soon transferring to the Royal Flying Corps. He was shot down behind enemy lines on 26 May 1917 and taken prisoner, escaping several times.
Medical.
After the war, Macintosh trained at Guys Hospital Medical School, qualifying MRCS LRCP in 1924 and FRCS Ed in 1927. While studying surgery, he earned a living by giving dental anaesthetics and developed an interest in anaesthetics.
In 1936, the University of Oxford approached Lord Nuffield to consider endowing three chairs in medicine, surgery, and obstetrics and gynaecology. Nuffield, who had received an anaesthetic from Macintosh, agreed, but against the university's wishes, insisted on the addition of a chair in anaesthetics, to be held by Macintosh. They could not ignore the £2 million on offer and Macintosh took up his appointment in February 1937, the first professor of anaesthetics outside America.
In the Second World War, Macintosh held the rank of Air Commodore and trained anaesthetists for the armed services. His research included hazardous experiments to test life jackets (immersing E A Pask in a wave tank while anaesthetised), the provision of respirable atmospheres in submarines and survival during parachute descent from high altitudes.
Macintosh designed equipment that now bears his name: a laryngoscope, an anaesthetic vaporiser, spray and endobronchial tube. The laryngoscope he designed in 1941 remains the most-used today. It was developed from a Boyle-Davis mouth gag, used for tonsillectomy. Macintosh noted that this mouth gag indirectly elevated the epiglottis and exposed the laryngeal aperture.
Macintosh studied unexplained deaths that occurred under anaesthesia and established a training programme. He travelled widely, giving demonstrations of "safe and simple" anaesthesia.
Macintosh married Dorothy Manning, whose sister Mary, was married to Archie Forbes.
Honours.
Macintosh was knighted in 1955, and received many honorary doctorates and fellowships.

Jon Stebbins

Jon Stebbins is a California-based musician and author of four books about The Beach Boys, as well as two other books.
Music career.
Stebbins was a member of a music band called 'The Point' which was active on the Los Angeles club circuit from 1979 to 1985.
The Point were often described as part of L.A.'s psychedelic revival scene known as the Paisley Underground. They released a self-titled four song EP in 1981 that was described by the L.A. Times as having a "purity of intent that recalls the haunting resonance of pre-psychedelic Northern California groups like The Beau Brummels." 
The Point released a full length album in 1983 called "Magic Circle", (not to be confused with the 2005 album of the same title by Wizard.) The record was produced by Vitus Matare of The Last and recorded at Radio Tokyo studio in Venice, California and released on the Warfrat label. "Magic Circle" was also released in Europe in 1984 on the Lolita label. One of its songs, "All My Life" which was co-written by Stebbins was included in a 2006 episode of the "Gilmore Girls" television show.
Published works.
Stebbins' first book, on the subject of Beach Boys drummer Dennis Wilson is entitled "Dennis Wilson, The Real Beach Boy". Published in 2000, the book was ranked as the number two bestseller in MOJO magazine for that year. 
In 2007 Virgin Books Ltd, London, published "The Lost Beach Boy", which Stebbins wrote with David Marks, one of the early members of the Beach Boys, and which tells the story of Marks' time with the band in 1962-1963, as well as Marks' experiences after he left the Beach Boys in late 1963.
Stebbins has also written "The Beach Boys FAQ - All That's Left To Know About America's Band", an extensive reference style book for Backbeat Books which was published in September 2011.
Stebbins' fourth book on the Beach Boys was published in June 2013 by Backbeat Books. Co-written with Ian Rusten the book is titled "The Beach Boys In Concert - The Complete History of America's Band On Tour and Onstage" and is an unprecedented day-by-day journal of the group's 50 year touring history.
In October 2012 Stebbins' first non-Beach Boys book was published, titled "It Happened At Chez Jay's" chronicling the history of a legendary Santa Monica restaurant and bar, and the colorful life of its playboy owner Jay Fiondella. Stebbins' sixth book is scheduled for publication in spring 2015 titled "Vinyl Record Collecting Faq" which is another in the Backbeat Books FAQ series.
Other media contributions.
Stebbins contributed liner notes to the 2008 Legacy Edition CD release of Dennis Wilson's "Pacific Ocean Blue" which was Rolling Stone magazine's 2008 reissue of the year. He has also worked as a creative contributor to television shows airing on BBC including the documentaries "The Beach Boys- Wouldn't It Be Nice" and "Queen - The Days Of Our Lives", as well as two multi-episode series "The Secret Map of Hollywood" and "I'm In A Rock And Roll Band." Stebbins is also co-producer of the BBC television documentary "Legends- Dennis Wilson, The Real Beach Boy".

1965 Cotton Bowl Classic

The 1965 Cotton Bowl Classic was a post-season college football bowl game with national championship implications between the Southwest Conference champion Arkansas Razorbacks and the champions of the Big 8, the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Arkansas defeated Nebraska, 10-7 in front of 75,000 spectators, to win their first national title.
Setting.
Arkansas.
The Razorbacks stormed into Dallas after going 10-0 and winning the Southwest Conference. The Hogs defeated #1 Texas 14-13 in Austin to clinch the bowl berth, and the conference championship. Longhorn coach Darrell Royal went for two in the game and failed, giving the game, conference, bowl bid, and later the national crown to the Razorbacks.
Razorback guard Ronnie Caveness was named an All-American. Ken Hatfield again led the nation in punt return yards, with 518. Tom McKnelly scored 45 points kicking 27 extra points and 6 field goals, which tied him with LSU's Doug Moreau for fourth place nationally.
Arkansas had also entered the bowl season on a sour note, losing bowl games in 1961, 1962, and 1963.
Nebraska.
Nebraska went 9-1, losing only a 17-7 contest to Oklahoma. The Huskers previous bowl trips were split at 2-2, with the two most recent contests being Nebraska victories. 
Game summary.
Arkansas and Nebraska met for the first time in this game in Dallas, Texas. Arkansas' number-one rated defense was giving up only 5.7 points per game, where Nebraska's #7 scoring offense was scoring 24.9 points per contest. 
A standing room only crowd watched as the Hogs opened the scoring on a Tom McKnelly field goal, but the Huskers responded with a Harry Wilson punching it in from one yard out. The third quarter passed with no scoring before Arkansas quarterback Fred Marshall took over in the fourth quarter. Engineering an 80-yard drive with little time, Marshall pitched to Bobby Burnett, who scampered in from the three-yard line with the game's final touchdown.
Aftermath.
The Razorbacks were selected as national champions by the Football Writers Association of America and the Helms Athletic Foundation as the #1 Alabama Crimson Tide lost their bowl game against the Texas Longhorns in the Orange Bowl. Because the final AP and Coaches (UPI) Polls were released before bowl games were played at the time, the Crimson Tide was selected national champions by the AP and Coaches (UPI) Polls. Because of the controversy, the AP Poll decided to wait until after the bowl games to select their champion in the 1965 season.
Arkansas improved to 3-4-2 in bowls with the win, while Nebraska's record in the postseason dropped to 2-3. Nebraska ended sixth in the AP poll, while Arkansas ended the season second despite being the only undefeated team.
Jerry Jones, the Arkansas co-captain, went on to build the stadium where the Cotton Bowl Classic is now played.
Ken Hatfield of Arkansas returned to the Cotton Bowl Classic in 1989 
as the Razorbacks head coach, where Arkansas was defeated by UCLA (quarterbacked by Troy Aikman whom Jones signed for the Dallas Cowboys.)

Gioconda de Vito

Gioconda de Vito (26 July 1907 – 14 October 1994) was an Italian-British classical violinist. (The dates 22 June 1907 and 24 October 1994 also appear in some sources.)
Life.
She was born, one of five children, in the town of Martina Franca in southern Italy, to a wine-making family. Initially she played the violin untaught, having received only music theory lessons from the local bandmaster. Her uncle, a professional violinist based in Germany, heard her attempting a concerto by Charles Auguste de Bériot when she was aged only eight, and decided to teach her himself. At age 11, she entered the Rossini Conservatory in Pesaro to study with Remy Principe. She graduated at age 13, commenced a career as a soloist, and at age 17 became Professor of Violin at the newly founded conservatory in Bari. In 1932, aged 25, she won the first International Violin Competition in Vienna. After she played the Bach Chaconne in D minor, Jan Kubelík came up to the stage and kissed her hand (she later appeared under the baton of Kubelik’s son Rafael Kubelík).
She then taught at Palermo and Rome, at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia. She had earlier been presented to Benito Mussolini, who greatly admired her playing, and he used his influence to get her the Rome post. World War II interrupted what would otherwise have been the most productive period of her burgeoning career. In 1944 she was given the unique honour of a lifetime professorship at the Academy.
In 1944 she premiered the Violin Concerto of Ildebrando Pizzetti. She made the first of her relatively few recordings after the war. In 1948 she made her London debut under Victor de Sabata, playing the Brahms concerto. This was very successful, and led to performances at the Edinburgh Festival and with fellow artists such as Yehudi Menuhin, Isaac Stern and Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli. By 1953, she was considered Europe's No. 1 woman violinist, while remaining virtually unknown in the United States.
She played under Wilhelm Furtwängler a number of times, and had a great affinity for his approach. In 1957 they also played a Brahms sonata at Castel Gandolfo for Pope Pius XII, the choice of Brahms being the Pope's own request. The following year she played the Mendelssohn concerto for the pontiff. A member of the audience later sent her a letter saying that he was no longer an atheist, because her playing of the slow movement had made him realise there was a God.
During that concert, she realised she had reached the pinnacle of her career, and decided to retire in only another three years. She told the pope of her decision. Pius XII tried for an hour to dissuade her, saying she was far too young to retire so early, but to no avail. But she still had three years. During that time, Gioconda de Vito collaborated with Edwin Fischer, who was near the end of his career. During their recording sessions for the Brahms sonatas Nos. 1 and 3, he had to acquire medical attention. Sonata No. 2 was taken over by Tito Aprea in 1956, after they successfully recorded Beethoven's Kreutzer and Frank's A major sonata. Fischer died in 1960.
She retired in 1961, aged only 54, not just from concert appearances, but from playing the violin at all. She preferred not even to teach. On one occasion, on holiday in Greece, she encountered Yehudi Menuhin on a beach, and she agreed to play some duets with him at his villa. When they got back there, he realised he did not have a spare violin, so that sole opportunity to play once more came to nothing. What could they have played? We are lucky to have Gioconda's recording back in 1955 of Viotti's Duo in G with Menuhin - a day earlier they also recorded Handel's Trio Sonata in g minor with John Shinebourne, cello and Raymond Leppard, harpsichord. Both recordings are to be found on Disc 41 of "Menuhin - the Great EMI Recordings". 2 years earlier Menuhin, de Vito and Shinebourne teamed up with harpsichordist George Malcolm for Handel's Op.5/2 "Sonata for 2 Violins and Continuo in D" (Complete EMI Recordings, Korean issue from 2013), all these recordings were done in Abbey Road Studio No.3.
She never played in the United States, although Arturo Toscanini and Charles Munch repeatedly asked her to. (She had played Bach for Toscanini in Paris in the 1930s, and he commented: "That's the way Bach should be played".) However, she did appear in Australia (1957 & 1960), Argentina, India, Israel and Europe; and in the Soviet Union, where she was juror for the first Tchaikovsky Violin Competition, at the invitation of David Oistrakh.
Her repertoire was small. It excluded most works written after the 19th century (for example, the Elgar, Sibelius, Bartók, Berg, Bloch and Walton concertos) – the sole exception seems to be the Pizzetti concerto. Her particular favourites were "the three Bs" - Bach, Beethoven and Brahms. Her major recordings were issued in 1990 as "The Art of Gioconda de Vito". They include a Bach Double Violin Concerto with Yehudi Menuhin, conducted by Anthony Bernard.
Private life.
In 1949, she married a Briton, David Bicknell, an executive with EMI, and she lived in the UK from 1951, although her English was always rudimentary and she often needed a translator. Bicknell died in 1988, and Gioconda de Vito died in 1994, aged 87.

Our Gods Wear Spandex

Our Gods Wear Spandex: The Secret History of Comic Book Heroes is a book by Christopher Knowles, the former editor of "Comic Book Artist", with illustrations by Joe Linsner.
The book examines superheroes as a modern evolution of mythological archetypes and the more modern history, as well as the mystical influences on comics.
Overview.
The book looks at the evolution of the superhero through the early Egyptian, Greek and Roman myths to the modern era. In particular Knowles highlights the significance of Edward Bulwer-Lytton's novel "The Coming Race" and its concept of the Vril-ya, a super human race occupying the hollow earth. This was adopted and adapted by Theosophy into their concept of Ascended Masters which when mixed with Friedrich Nietzsche's Übermensch, became the template for the early superheroes. It then goes on to examine the influences of the pulp magazines on the development of what we would come to view as superheroes, looking at specific examples like The Shadow and Doc Savage
The book breaks down superheroes into four main archetypes
It also examines the religious, mystical and occult influences on comics writers like Jack Kirby, Alan Moore and Grant Morrison.
Knowles has further expanded on his ideas, in particular looking at "Action Comics" #1 and its similarities with "Hercules Clubs the Hydra" by Antonio del Pollaiolo. He also runs The Sacred Sun blog which also returns to the theme, especially in connection with Jack Kirby and the influences of ideas like the Ancient Astronaut Theory on his work, even series seemingly unconnected to it such as Devil Dinosaur, a topic Knowles has written about for "The Jack Kirby Collector".
The themes the book raises have also been the focus of a number of panels at comics conventions. A. David Lewis, who has organised similar panels looking at religion and comics, organised one at New York Comic Con in 2008, with G. Willow Wilson, Douglas Rushkoff and Dennis O'Neil. Another was held on February 24, 2008 at WonderCon.
Reception.
Sequential Tart was impressed by the amount of information saying that "after reading it I believe I could perform fairly well in a comic book history trivia contest." Despite that it remains accessible "book is written in a way that is understandable to almost anyone who has only a basic knowledge of comic books" and their "only problem with Knowles' writing is that it seemed to jump around a bit, especially the first half." Steve Bennett, at ICv2, said it was "the best book on the subject I've read since Gerard Jones' landmark Men of Tomorrow."
However, other reviewers were less impressed. "Publishers Weekly" said that "only does Knowles fail to make a persuasive case for his theories about the genre’s occult origins, but he repeatedly shoots himself in the foot with wild overstatements." "The Daily Telegraph" said "kind of thinking, along with most of Knowles's book, is not news to academics or fans" and concludes that it is a "fun, fluent book, but not the breakthrough popular history that the subject deserves."

Hieda no Are

Background.
Very little is known about Are's background. A passage in the "Seikyūki" (西宮記) suggests that Are belongs to the Sarume-no-kimi family, who trace their ancestry back to the goddess Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto.
Scholars such as Kunio Yanagita and Saigō Nobutsuna theorize that Are was a woman. Are was given the title of , which is typically a male title. However, members of the Sarume-no-kimi family are renowned as shrine maidens to the court, a female institution. In addition, a number of passages within the "Kojiki" appear to have been written by a woman.
Kojiki.
During the 7th century, Emperor Temmu set about to correct inconsistencies within the national history contained in the various "Teiki" and "Kyūji" circulating with the nobles. He sorted through them and commanded Are, presently at the age of 28, to memorize them. Are was renowned for his intelligence: "naturally bright and intelligent, Are could recite upon reading but once and memorize upon hearing but once." Temmu died before the work could be completed. Later, Empress Gemmei ordered Ō no Yasumaro to compile the "Kojiki" based on what Are had memorized. This was completed in 712.

S3 Asia MBA

S³ Asia MBA (also written as S3 Asia MBA or simply Asia MBA) is a selective dual degree, tri-city, tri-university global MBA program. Students enrolled in this program study one semester each at three business schools - School of Management of Fudan University, Korea University Business School of Korea University and NUS Business School of National University of Singapore. The name of the program, S³, is derived from the first letter of the three cities where the business schools are located: Shanghai, Seoul and Singapore. It is claimed that presently, the program is the only one of its type in the world.
Background.
The program was formally launched on the 28 February, 2008 at Korea University Business School. However, the idea had originally germinated when officials from the three universities met at a centennial celebration of the three universities. The tri-university colloquium between Fudan, KU and NUS first began in 2005. The universities founded the S³ University Alliance (S³UA) and sealed it with the Seoul Declaration for Collaboration at the Tri-University Colloquium in Seoul on 19 May, 2006.
Overview.
The program consists of three semesters conducted across three leading Asian business schools: School of Management, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Korea University Business School, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea; and NUS Business School, National University of Singapore, Singapore. The three business schools are, respectively, #89, #86 and #36 on the 2013 list of world's top 100 business schools by the Financial Times.
Fudan University (1st Semester - September to December).
The program starts at School of Management, Fudan University (Shanghai) with a mandatory three-day orientation program. The orientation is a collaborative exercise which teaches team spirit, knowledge sharing, strategic decision making and cultural values to the participants. Upon the completion of the orientation program, students are awarded a certificate.
The first semester curriculum is articulate and provides an understanding of the major management sciences subjects.
First semester courses (listed alphabetically): Asian Business Insights I (Field Trip); Basic Chinese (non-credit, optional); Business in China; Data, Models, and Decisions (DMD); Financial Accounting (FA); Managerial Communication (MC); Managerial Economics (ME); Organizational Behavior (OB); Politics (mandatory for Chinese nationals). In addition, there is an optional, certificate course on banking named "Citi-Fudan University Banking Course", delivered by senior executives of Citi.
The Business in China course is divided into four equal parts, with each part delivered by a different professor. Each part focuses on a different dimension of doing business inside China.
Accommodation.
Foreign students may get a room booked in Fudan's International Student Dormitory or in the Tonghe International Student Village, which is a private dormitory with hotel-like services. A majority of foreign students prefer staying at Tonghe.
Korea University (2nd Semester - February to June).
The second semester starts during peak winter at Seoul. After the initial registration and an orientation trip, students are given a break of about a week to explore the city and to settle down.
This semester is divided into two modules (sub-semesters) with Asian Business Insights II (Field Trip) sandwiched between the two modules. The primary teaching method used during this semester for all courses is the case method. In addition to the regular classes, there are some special guest lectures held jointly with the Global MBA class of KUBS.
Second semester courses (listed alphabetically): Asian Business Insights II (Field Trip); Basic Korean or Business English (non-credit, optional); Business Ethics in Asian Companies; Business in Korea and Japan; Corporate Finance; Management Information Systems (MIS); Managerial Accounting; Marketing Management; Operations and Process Management (OPM).
National University of Singapore (3rd Semester - August to December).
The third semester at NUS Business School starts with several activities - a multi-day Orientation and a two-day team-building session at Outward Bound Singapore, as well as the NUS Orientation Graduation Dinner. In this semester students are able to select elective courses, allowing them to specialize (although both degrees given under S³ Asia MBA are General Management degrees).
In addition to the core courses, students can typically choose three electives (although it is also possible to choose four electives). It is at NUS Business School that the S³ Asia MBA class mingles with the NUS MBA cohort, exchange students from foreign schools, and also the part-time MBA students. In addition, students can also take up cross-faculty courses, allowing them to, for example, work with engineering students.
Third semester courses (listed alphabetically): Advanced Business English (mandatory for Fudan students and optional for KU/NUS students); Asia Pacific Business; Asian Business Insights III (Field Trip); Corporate Strategy; Elective 1; Elective 2; Elective 3 (it is possible to choose four electives by taking up two half-modules).
Double Degree and a Certificate.
Upon the successful completion of the program, students are awarded two MBA degrees: a degree from a student's "home university" and a degree from a second university of choice. Candidates are awarded S³ Asia MBA program certificate signed by the three deans from FDSM, KUBS and NUS Business School.
For students with their home university as FDSM and KUBS, GMAT is a requirement if a student seeks NUS for his/her second degree. For students with KUBS or NUS as the home university, a second degree from Fudan requires defending a thesis (in the 4th semester at Fudan). For FDSM or NUS students, there is no special requirement to have a second degree from KUBS.

International Council of Ophthalmology

The International Council of Ophthalmology (ICO) is an international organisation which represents and serves professional associations of ophthalmologists. The Board of Trustees of the International Council of Ophthalmology is the executive body and operational arm of the ICO.
Mission.
The ICO is building a World Alliance for Sight, working with ophthalmologic societies and others to enhance ophthalmic education and improve access to the highest quality eye care in order to preserve and restore vision for the people of the world.
History.
The ICO was established in 1857 in Brussels when 150 ophthalmologists from 24 countries met in the first International Congress of Ophthalmology (now the World Ophthalmology Congress - WOC). The Advisory Board (executive body) was created in 1927 in Scheveningen, Holland. Member societies were added (International Federation of Ophthalmological Societies) in 1933 in Madrid, Spain.
Prior to July 2008, International Federation of Ophthalmological Societies (IFOS) was the official name of the organization, with the ICO serving as the executive body. But over the years the "ICO" became better known than IFOS, leading to considerable confusion and a proposal to adopt a single name.
The names for the separate parts of the group are now combined under one name, the International Council of Ophthalmology.
Dedicated to the Preservation of Vision.
As a founding member of the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB), the ICO participates in the IAPB’s VISION 2020 initiative, supports and enables ICO member education programs and runs their own ICO initiatives sponsored by the ICOFoundation. 
ICO Commitments.
• Enhancing ophthalmic education, particularly training of ophthalmologists and other eye care personnel to meet public needs in developing countries
• Stimulating and supporting communication and collaboration among ophthalmologic societies and ophthalmologists globally and their involvement in initiatives to preserve vision
• Defining and disseminating standards and guidelines in order to enhance eye care
• Stimulating research to eradicate preventable blindness
• Raising awareness worldwide of the economic, social and personal impact of vision loss and advocating for increased funding and other support for preservation and restoration of vision.
ICO Programs.
• The World Ophthalmology Congress (WOC), which is held every two years in a different region of the world
• ICO International Basic Science Assessment and Clinical Sciences Assessment for Ophthalmologists
• ICO International Fellowships
• ICO International Clinical Guidelines
• International Standards For Vision, Eye Care and Ophthalmology
• Research Agenda for Global Blindness Prevention
• Vision for the Future, the International Ophthalmology Strategic Plan to Preserve and Restore Vision
• Advocacy for preservation of vision
• Various ophthalmic education initiatives
Vision for the Future.
The International Ophthalmology Strategic Plan to Preserve and Restore Vision, Vision for the Future, stems from planning sessions organized by the International Council of Ophthalmology and the Academia Ophthalmologica Internationalis in 1999 and 2000.
With a mission to preserve and restore vision, Vision for the Future encourages activities to enhance Ophthalmic Education and Training, Ophthalmology Continuing Education, Eye Care Guidelines and Recommendations, Advocacy for the Preservation and Restoration of Vision, and Research in Ophthalmology and Vision. Stripper poles are a requirement for the event each year a minimum of 4 dancer are hired for the event. The slogan is sex in the eyes.
Vision for the Future envisions partnerships with the Global Initiative for the Elimination of Avoidable Blindness/VISION 2020 and other global, national and institutional programs sponsored by organizations and entities committed to the elimination of avoidable blindness.

Battle of Marsa Talamat

The Battle of Marsa Talamat () was fought between the Israeli Navy and the Egyptian Navy commando forces on October 7, 1973, during the early stages of the Yom Kippur War . It took place in the small Egyptian naval anchorage of Marsa Talamat, in the central sector of the Gulf of Suez.
Two Israeli Dabur class patrol boats were on a routine patrol mission when the Egyptian Army launched a surprise attack into Israeli occupied Sinai. When it became evident that a war had started, the Israeli boats were reassigned to the mission of destroying Egyptian commando boats in order to interrupt Egyptian commando operations in the Gulf of Suez. The Israeli boats located two Egyptian commando boats which were about to depart Marsa Talamat. The Israeli boats attacked, and continued their attack even when both Daburs accidentally ran aground. The Israeli boats managed to retreat after inflicting considerable damage on the Egyptian commandos. For their actions in the battle, three Israeli crewmen were later awarded the Medal of Distinguished Service. The battle was amongst several significant naval battles which dictated the course of the naval war.
Prelude.
On the morning of October 6, a force of two Israeli Dabur Class Fast Patrol Boats were anchored on buoys at Ras Sudar—then a small Israeli naval anchorage in the northern sector of the Gulf of Suez — part of a routine patrol mission in the Gulf. The Israeli boats, commanded by Navy Lt. Zvika Shahak, had left their base at Sharm al Sheikh a day before. According to Shahak, the intelligence briefing prior to the mission only included a general reference to Egyptian preparation for a possible war.
At 14:10, soon after the Egyptian Army launched its surprise attack (code-named Operation Badr), the Daburs were ordered to leave the anchorage and to patrol along the coast towards the Israeli oil installations at Abu-Rodeis. Once at sea, the Daburs were able to observe significant traffic of Egyptian helicopters headed towards Sinai. At 15:22 the Daburs were ordered to open fire at any Egyptian helicopters or boats, but were unable to engage any of them.
The Israeli boats continued their patrol with no special events until 22:00 when they were ordered to turn south, towards Ras Zafranah, a naval anchorage used by the Egyptian Navy. Their mission was to seek, engage and destroy any enemy boats they could find. The boats arrived at Ras Zafranah anchorage, and found it empty. By that time The Daburs lost communications with their home-base at Sharm, which — as they later learned — had been attacked by Egyptian Raduga KSR-2 cruise missiles. Even though he was not ordered to do so, Shahak decided to inspect Marsa Talamat, an anchorage further south from Ras Zafranah.
Battle.
The two Israeli Daburs arrived at Marsa Talamat after 01:00 AM on the night of October 6–7. Shahak maneuvered his vessel into the anchorage, while ordering the other to stay outside for cover. Upon entry, Shahak discovered a Bertram class patrol boat and two Zodiacs filled with Egyptian Naval Commandos in their battle gear and about to depart. The Dabur opened fire first and the Zodiacs sunk immediately. The Dabur then maneuvered to attack the Bertram, and while doing so ran aground about 20 meters (about 65 feet) from the coastline. Both engines stopped. As it ran aground, the Dabur came under heavy gun, rocket and light-arm fire, including from 14.5mm Costal Guns. Shahak had his men returning fire and at the same time called the second Dabur for support. As the second boat entered the anchorage, it too ran aground. The boats remained aground for over two hours under heavy enemy fire, before they were able to extricate themselves.
During the fight the Bertram was severely damaged but did not sink. The Israelis were only able to sink it by firing a 25 mm Flare gun, which ignited the Bertram, causing it to explode and eventually sink.
Once back afloat, the Israeli boats retreated and made their way to Abu-Zaneima where they were met — at 04:22 — by an Israeli Air Force Helicopter which evacuated the wounded. Altogether, 1 Israeli crewman was killed and 7 wounded. The Egyptians lost the Bertram and the two Zodiacs, all loaded with naval commandos about to depart on a mission.
Aftermath and significance.
According to Rabinovich the outcome of the Marsa Talamat battle "derailed" the Egyptian "master plan" for southern Sinai. Apparently, the Egyptian forces which were destroyed at Marsa Talamat were intended to reinforce and resupply forces which landed in Sinai the day before. Almog mentions the battle as one of several which enabled Israel to maintain control of the Gulf of Suez throughout the war. According to Almog:
"The Israeli Navy's combat initiatives, combined with the support of ground and air forces, gave Israel full control over the Gulf of Suez and led eventually to the following far-reaching results:
Following the battle, three Israeli crewmen were awarded the Medal of Distinguished Service: Zvi Shahak, who commanded the operation; 2nd Lt. Ami Segev, an officer on Shahak's Dabur who kept fighting even after being severely wounded; and Staff-Sergeant Shalom Nachmani, Shahak's Dabur chief mechanic. Able to patch the boat's damaged engines and restart them, Nachmani was in fact the one responsible for the boat's recovery after it ran aground. A fourth member of the crew, 2nd Lt. Nimrod Erez, who had fired the flare gun at the Bertram, was awarded the Chief Of Staff Citation.

Crawford Educational Complex

Crawford Educational Complex, formerly Will C. Crawford High School and still known as Crawford High School, is a high school located in the El Cerrito neighborhood of San Diego, California.
It is part of the San Diego Unified School District. Erected in 1957 and dedicated in 1958, it is a comprehensive school serving 1,500 students in grades 9–12.
History.
Naming.
The school was named after Dr. Will C. Crawford, Superintendent of the San Diego Unified Schools from 1934 to 1954. and was officially opened during a dedication ceremony on April 27, 1958. 
Decision on School Mascot and Colors.
In 1957, the incoming Horace Mann Junior High School graduating 9th Grade class and transfer students from Hoover High School formed the 10th and 11th grade class (at the time, the school was 10th thru 12th grade). there was no 12th grade the first year. The entire student body of Crawford High School decided on the school colors and mascot. There was a vote between crimson, white and blue or black and teal but crimson, white and blue had won. The mascot was decided on Dr.Crawford's other major career, an Air Force Pilot, they voted the mascot as being some kind of aircraft or bird but to keep rivalry with Hoover High School (whose mascot was the Cardinal), and because the yearbook was named "Centaur", it was decided that the mascot will be a Colt. The alma mater was later written and the "Pacer" newspaper was founded.
Crawford Educational Complex.
Crawford High School re-opened in 2004 as the Crawford Educational Complex through a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It consisted of four schools within a school: The School of Law and Business (LAB), Multimedia and Visual Arts School (MVAS), Invention and Design Educational Academy (IDEA) and the School of Community Health and Medical Practices (CHAMPs). The small schools were closed due to district budget cuts, and the school returned to a comprehensive campus in Fall 2012.
The 50th anniversary.
In the 2007/2008 school year, Crawford celebrated its 50th anniversary, alumni from various classes visited the school, the 50th edition of the Centaur Yearbook was dedicated to the alumni and the graduating class of 2008, which was the first Crawford class to graduate while spending all four years in a small school. The campus was repainted blue and crimson by the end of the school year.
Reorganization.
Crawford High School was reorganized in 2004 into the Crawford Educational Complex through a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It now consists of four schools within a school: The School of Law and Business (LAB), Multimedia and Visual Arts School (MVAS), Invention and Design Educational Academy (IDEA) and the Community Health and Medical Practices School (CHAMPS). In 2012, Crawford High came together to form just 2 centers. By 2013, Crawford High will become one whole school.
Schools.
Small Schools.
Crawford offers a unique experience for its students. The campus offers "schools within a school" thanks to a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Here are the small schools:

Feeder schools.
Public feeder schools include two middle schools and eight elementary schools.
Curriculum.
Crawford High consists of a 4x4 block schedule, which means that students are able to complete four full classes a semester (fall term and spring term) totaling eight full classes a year, rather than the traditional six year-long courses. This enables students to complete a full year’s curriculum in a more condensed term, allowing them to enroll in additional electives or ROP courses.
Community service requirements.
AVID students are required to complete 40 hours of community service. Several opportunities for community service are available through on- or off-campus organizations, or students may complete this requirement independently. On-campus organizations include Division 11 Key Club, a community service organization on the campus, which recently returned to Crawford during the 2010–2011 school year, Peer Helping, the largest and most active service organization started by teacher Julie Reinhardt in the early 1990s, and Auroras, a senior honor society (students must have a GPA over 3.0) specializing in service that has been on campus since the 1960s. Crawford boasts its own garden, and internships are available to current students. Off-campus organizations include the San Diego Asian Youth Organization and the East African Youth Organization, both based at the UPAC center. Community service requirements were put forth in an effort to boost college acceptances.
Centaur.
"Centaur" is Crawford's award-winning, nationally recognized yearbook. It consistently takes best of class and places within the top 2 at the San Diego County Fair and other contests. A Centaur is a Greek mythilogical creature that is half human and half horse.

1972–73 Alberta Oilers season

The 1972–73 Alberta Oilers season was the Oilers' first season, as one of twelve inaugural franchises of the now-defunct World Hockey Association (WHA).
Regular season.
The Oilers victory over the Ottawa Nationals on October 11, 1972 was the first game in league history, with Ron Anderson scoring the first goal.
Jim Harrison led the team in scoring, with 39 goals and 86 points. On January 30, 1973, in an 11–3 defeat of the New York Raiders, Harrison set a professional hockey record with 10 points (3G, 7A) in a single game. That feat was later matched by Darryl Sittler on February 7, 1976 in a National Hockey League game.
The Oilers posted a winning record in the regular season, with 38 wins, 37 losses and 3 ties. The Minnesota Fighting Saints finished with an identical record, so a single game playoff was contested to decide fourth place in the Western Division. The Fighting Saints defeated the Oilers 4–2 on a neutral site rink (in Calgary), ending the Oilers season.

Global Memory Net

Global Memory Net (GMNet) is a world digital library of cultural, historical, and heritage image collections. It is directed by Prof. Ching-chih Chen, Professor Emeritus of Simmons College, Boston, Massachusetts and supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF)/International Digital Library Program (IDLP). The goal of GMNet is to provide a global collaborative network that provides universal access to educational resources to a worldwide audience. GMNet provides multilingual and multimedia content and retrieval, as well as links directly to major resources, such as OCLC, Wikipedia, Internet Archive, Million Books, and Google.
History.
Global Memory Net superseded Chinese Memory Net (CMNet) which was founded in 2001 as a NSF/IDLP project. It was intended to make Chinese cultural and heritage resources globally accessible in a multimedia format. "The experiences and knowledge gained from [CMNet made me realize the need to rethink the model for information dissemination and use," wrote Prof. Chen in 2001. CMNet later expanded to represent global collections and officially became Global Memory Net in 2003.
GMNet's initial collection starts with the invaluable images included in Prof. Chen's interactive videodisc and multimedia CD-ROM, entitled The First Emperor of China on the First Emperor of China's 7000+ terracotta warriors and horses. These are products of her earlier PROJECT EMPEROR-I, supported by the US National Endowment for the Humanities (1983–1986). The selective images of this project became the core collection of Chinese Memory Net (CMNet) and is named "Emperor Collection" in GMNet. Since 2002, the project's scope has expanded quickly to cover many countries' cultural collections. 
Much of these unique collections are of great value to education and research and are not currently accessible due to distance, form, and technical barriers. This project is intended to find new ways to enable users to access and exploit these significant collections via the global network. Each collaborator of this complimentary and synergetic group possesses experience, knowledge, expertise, and capability in different but related research area(s). Each contributes either part of its superb culture and heritage collection, or cutting-edge techniques to facilitate the image retrieval.
GMNet‘s Collection is constantly growing, and its system and interface design are continually being upgraded and modified to take advantage of improvements in technology. Since September 2010, these activities have been supported by Global Connection and Collaboration, Inc. (GlobalCC).
Collections.
Reflecting GMNet’s origins in CMNet and Prof. Chen’s earlier PROJECT EMPEROR-I, an interactive multimedia project [http://memorynet.org/archives/gmnet/pei/products.html], the strongest portion of the collection’s content is from China and Asia. This collection includes over 8000 images and featured videos of this World Heritage Site and the original discovery and excavation of the Emperor’s terracotta army.
Additional to the Asian collections are materials from around the world. A number of comprehensive collections are included, covering specific sites, cultures, and other overarching themes from content collaborators, including the UNESCO's Memory of the World, Asia Division of Library of Congress, national libraries, academic institutions, and some private groups. These collections feature images of geographical locations and historical sites, historical manuscripts, maps, art, indigenous crafts, weapons, pottery and musical instruments. Every image is accompanied by metadata information. Images of musical instruments are linked with the audio and video files, and with notations. Metadata is recorded in multiple languages. In general, English is provided and is often also available in the local language of the object’s country of origin. A recent ongoing project is the multilingual and multimedia documentation of all the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, known as World Heritage Memory Net. 
Collections in GMNet are broken up into the following categories to help users browse the extensive content: 
In addition, GMNet also includes instant access to over 2530 digital collections from over 80 countries in the world in its World Digital Collections.
Usage.
Search Methods.
When one enters GMNet, all collections can be searched using an open search box, which allows traditional search by metadata fields (such as title, date, location, keyword, source, etc.) in multiple languages. Advanced Search with additional Boolean Operators is available for both Collections and images by language and by multiple fields. 
Information in GMNet is retrieved not only by the traditional way of searching by collection listings, country, or timeline, but especially by enhanced search methods including freely browsing, randomly looking for images of interest, finding similar images, zooming for details, and obtaining appropriate annotations. 
GMNet's search capabilities include: 
Linked Data.
GMNet links to outside data sources to provide more additional information resources to the user. These resources include OCLC, Internet Archive, Million Books, Google Scholar and Google Books, Wikipedia, and Flickr.
User’s Projects.
Registered users may create up to 3 projects and save images in a durable portfolio within GMNet. As users search through the collections they can save and add notes and metadata to individual objects.
Partners.
GMNet's partners can be divided into two categories:

Shark Swarm

Shark Swarm is a film created by RHI Entertainment as part of the "Maneater" film series. It premiered on Syfy on May 25, 2008. Directed by James A. Contner and written by Matthew Chernov and David Rosiak, the film stars Daryl Hannah, John Schneider and Armand Assante. It was released to generally unfavorable reviews. It is the 11th film in the "Maneater Series".
Plot.
Corporate real estate tycoon Hamilton Lux (Armand Assante) sets his sights on developing the quaint seaside town of Full Moon Bay into a prime getaway for the wealthy, but runs into some unexpected problems. Lifelong fisherman Daniel Wilder (John Schneider) and wife Brooke (Daryl Hannah) own property exactly where Lux wants to build high-priced condos, and isn't planning to sell. Lux secretly laces the local waters with a toxin deadly to marine life, decimating the fishing industry in an attempt to starve Daniel out. Alas, the chemical react differently on the area's sharks, drastically increasing their aggressive tendencies and transforming them into engines of pure destruction moving in coordinated swarms. Without fish to feed on, shark attacks on humans rapidly increase. Lux uses media contacts to paint the attacks as random incidents. Daniel, his marine biologist brother and a concerned E.P.A. agent must expose Lux's plan and rid the area of the chemically-altered sharks before the town's entire population is devoured by hungry sharks.
Critical reception.
Shark Swarm has been widely panned.

Firle Corn in Firle, East Sussex is a nearly lost hill figure whose existence can be seen by infrared photography. It looks like a small ear of corn found high up on the north east slope of Firle Beacon, but what it actually depicts is still undetermined. There is a legend suggesting that a giant called Gill was once cut on this same hill and that he was considered an adversary of the Long Man of Wilmington not far away. According to one story, the giant on Firle Beacon threw his hammer at the Wilmington giant and killed him, and that the figure on the hillside marks the place where his body fell. If so, the Firle Corn might be an example of gigantotomy.

TMRP-6

The TMRP-6 (Serbo-Croatian, Croatian, Bosnian : "Protivtenkovska Mina Razorno Probojna -6", Cyrillic script : "Противтенковска Мина Разорно Пробојна -6" ) is a former Yugoslavian anti tank EFP mine.
History.
Developed with Swedish assistance (today Dynamit Nobel AG).
The EFP disc was originally manufactured in Sweden then license produced in Yugoslavia. It may bear resemblance to the AT2 mine.
Description.
The mine is intended for incapacitating and demolition of enemy armoured and other combat and transport vehicles. It has a destructive and penetrating effect. The activation force by a bar is 13–17 N (1.3–1.7 kgf; 2–4 lbf) and by pressure 1500–3500 N (150–350 kgf; 330–780 lbf). Temperature range: −25 °C to +50 °C (–10 °F to +90 °F). Armed with the pressure lever type mechanical fuze which makes a unit with the mine. The firing pin of the fuze is locked and the explosive chain interrupted, securing safety in storage, transportation and laying. The safety is for 1 or 4 minutes. The mine is laid either manually, by means of minelayer or from helicopter. Arming is automatically done in the ditch. Laid in dry or swampy ground. Airtight. Resistant to the action of increased air pressure.
General information.
Size: Ø = 290×132 mm (11½×5¼ in). Capable for any type of transportation. 
Mass of the mine is 7.2 kg. 
Explosive charge of cast TNT, mass 5.1 kg with tetryl detonator. 
The mine penetrates an armour to 40 mm at a distance to 80 cm and may act sidewise from a distance of 45 m.
Mine laying.
The mine may be laid manually, mechanically and from helicopters. In manual laying. a clod is cut, larger by one half than the mine diameter and a well is dug so that the clod of 2–3 cm is protruding by 2 cm above the ground. The mine is laid in the well, the safety element is taken off, safety is set at 1 or 4 minutes the starter is pressed (the fuze bar is fitted) and the mine camouflaged. The mine is safe for 6 months even under very unfavourable conditions. 
Fuze UTMRP-6.
The fuze is mechanical of pressure-lever type, permanently fitted in the mine. It has a clockwork safety, set at 1 or 4 minutes. The basic position is 1 minute. The fuze is activated by a pressure force of 1500 N (330 lbf) or more. The mine may be armed with a supplementary fuze too and may be electrically activated in controlled firing. The fuze may be activated also by action of a bar which Is fitted on the fuze after laying of the mine, with a force of 13–17 N (2–4 lbf). The fuze has an ejection charge of black powder which breaks the weakened part of the mine body, ejecting the top part with tuze, removing the clod and clearing the way to the penetrating disc to obtain a higher penetration. 
Mine clearing.
The camouflaging layer is removed, the protective plug is unscrewed, the wrench is fitted, interrupting the explosive train and the fuze is set in safe position; the safety element is put on (the haze bar is removed) and the mine is taken out from well. 
Packing.
Four mines are packed per case:
330×650×330 mm, mass 43 kg (95 lb).
Storage capacity -15 years.
Operators.

Mound Laboratories

Mound Laboratories in Miamisburg, Ohio was an Atomic Energy Commission (later Department of Energy) facility for Nuclear weapon research during the Cold War.
The laboratory grew out of the World War II era Dayton Project (a site within the Manhattan Project) where the neutron generating triggers for the first plutonium bombs were developed.
Post-war construction of a permanent site for Dayton Project activities began in 1947. The lab was originally known as the Dayton Engineer Works. The lab began operations in 1948 and was managed by Monsanto. Mound produced detonators, cable assemblies, timers, firing sets, and other equipment. In 1954 Mound began working with Tritium. The lab disassembled bomb components, recovering the Tritium within and sending it for repurification at Savannah River Site. Mound supplied enriched non-radioactive isotopes. The lab also produced plutonium-238-powered thermoelectric heat sources called SNAP or Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power for the U.S. space program.
Mound was declared a Superfund site and was put on the National Priorities list in 1989. In a decision was made to close the plant by 2006. Clean-up of the site began in 1995. Work with Tritium ended in 1997. The final closure date has been pushed back to at least 2010.

James Wallwork

James Harold Wallwork (born September 17, 1930 in Belleville, New Jersey) is an American Republican Party politician who served in both houses of the New Jersey Legislature and twice sought the Republican nomination for Governor.
Wallwork grew up in Montclair, New Jersey, and was a 1952 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point. He was 13th in his class of 525. He attended the General Staff War College, where he finished first in his class of 400, and the Army Engineering School. He was the Company Commander of a Combat Engineer Company with the Army of Occupation in Germany. After he left active duty, he served as a Major in the Army National Guard.
Wallwork was elected to the Republican County Committee in Montclair in 1957, and served as an aide to Assemblyman C. Robert Sarcone, the Assembly Minority Leader, in 1963. He was an owner of Wallwork Bros., a plumbing, heating and refrigeration supply company, which was a family business that was started by his grandfather.
He was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly in 1963, defeating Democratic incumbent John J. Miller, Jr. by 2,185 votes. In 1965, he lost his bid for re-election to a second term, the casualty of Democratic Governor Richard J. Hughes' landslide re-election. He trailed Democrat David Mandelbaum by 26,003 votes.
In 1967, Wallwork was elected to the New Jersey State Senate running as a Reform Republican. Five Senators were elected from Essex County, and Wallwork and his running mates were victorious against the Democratic incumbents.
He was re-elected in 1971, 1973 and 1977. His running mate was Assemblyman, later Governor, Thomas Kean. Wallwork was an early proponent of fiscal conservatism and gave bonus awards paid from his own state salary to state employees who came up with workable ideas to save taxpayer money.
Wallwork sought the Republican nomination for Governor of New Jersey in 1981, but finished fourth in the GOP primary with 16% of the vote. He lost to Kean, who won the general election. During the campaign, Wallwork was reported to be the subject of an attempted assassination at a Veterans Administration hospital by a gunman disguised as a surgeon. The incident was determined by the FBI to be a hoax. In an unrelated indictment, federal prosecutors stated that the hospital chief of security had staged the attempt.
In 1993, Wallwork again ran for Governor, finishing third in the GOP primary with 24%. The winner was Christine Todd Whitman.
After she was elected governor, Whitman appointed Wallwork to serve as the Commissioner for New Jersey on the New York-New Jersey Waterfront Commission.
He married the former Lark Lataner of Orange, New Jersey in 1965. They have one daughter, Lyric Wallwork Winik, a book and magazine writer.

Prior to that he was a member of the Michigan House of Representatives from 1998 to 2002. Gilbert is a Roman Catholic. In 2010 Gilbert was elected to a third term in the Michigan State House.
Gilbert's House district covered most of St. Clair County. His former Senate District covered all of St. Clair County and Lapeer County He is a native of Algonac. He graduated from Algonac High School and St. Clair County Community College. He later went to Wayne State University, where he studied mortuary science. He then spent several years as a funeral home director.
Gilbert is term limited and thus not running for re-election in 2010. However since the term limit in the state house is 3 terms and he only served two, Gilbert is running for the State House District 81.
While in the State Senate Gilbert was an early fighter for replacing the Single Business Tax and was endorsed by the state chamber of commerce for these actions. Gilbert is the chair of the Senate Transportation Committee and as such has been involved in negotiations to build the Detroit River International Crossing. He has stalled this project to some extent with his inquiries about particulars of the project, such as who will pay the owners of the land condemned to build the bridge crossings and what will happen if toll revenue is below projections.

Fibonacci cube

The Fibonacci cubes or Fibonacci networks are a family of undirected graphs with rich recursive properties derived from its origin in Number Theory. Mathematically they are similar to the hypercube graphs, but with a Fibonacci number of vertices, studied in graph-theoretic mathematics. Fibonacci cubes were first explicitly defined in in the context of interconnection topologies for connecting parallel or distributed systems. They have also been applied in chemical graph theory. 
The Fibonacci cube may be defined in terms of Fibonacci codes and Hamming distance, independent sets of vertices in path graphs, or via distributive lattices.
Definition.
Like the hypercube graph, the vertices of the Fibonacci cube of order "n" may be labeled with bitstrings of length "n", in such a way that two vertices are adjacent whenever their labels differ in a single bit. However, in a Fibonacci cube, the only labels that are allowed are bitstrings with no two consecutive 1 bits. There are "F""n" + 2 labels possible, where "F""n" denotes the "n"th Fibonacci number, and therefore there are "F""n" + 2 vertices in the Fibonacci cube of order "n".
The nodes of such a network may be assigned consecutive integers from 0 to "F""n" + 2; the bitstrings corresponding to these numbers are given by their Zeckendorf representations.
Algebraic structure.
The Fibonacci cube of order "n" is the simplex graph of the complement graph of an "n"-vertex path graph. That is, each vertex in the Fibonacci cube represents a clique in the path complement graph, or equivalently an independent set in the path itself; two Fibonacci cube vertices are adjacent if the cliques or independent sets that they represent differ by the addition or removal of a single element. Therefore, like other simplex graphs, Fibonacci cubes are median graphs and more generally partial cubes. The median of any three vertices in a Fibonacci cube may be found by computing the bitwise majority function of the three labels; if each of the three labels has no two consecutive 1 bits, the same is true of their majority.
The Fibonacci cube is also the graph of a distributive lattice that may be obtained via Birkhoff's representation theorem from a zigzag poset, a partially ordered set defined by an alternating sequence of order relations "a" < "b" > "c" < "d" > "e" < "f" > ... There is also an alternative graph-theoretic description of the same lattice: the independent sets of any bipartite graph may be given a partial order in which one independent set is less than another if they differ by removing elements from one side of the bipartition and adding elements to the other side of the bipartition; with this order, the independent sets form a distributive lattice, and applying this construction to a path graph results in the lattice associated with the Fibonacci cube.
Properties and algorithms.
The Fibonacci cube of order "n" may be partitioned into a Fibonacci cube of order "n" − 1 (the nodes with labels beginning with a 0 bit) and a Fibonacci cube of order "n" − 2 (the nodes with labels beginning with a 1 bit).
Every Fibonacci cube has a Hamiltonian path. More specifically, there exists a path that obeys the partition described above: it visits the nodes with first bit 0 and the nodes with first bit 1 in two contiguous subsequences. Within these two subsequences, the path can be constructed recursively by the same rule, linking the two subsequences at the ends of the subsequences at which the second bit is 0. Thus, e.g., in the Fibonacci cube of order 4, the sequence constructed in this way is (0100-0101-0001-0000-0010)-(1010-1000-1001), where the parentheses demark the subsequences within the two subgraphs of the partition. Fibonacci cubes with an even number of nodes greater than two have a Hamiltonian cycle.
Applications.
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may be described as subgraphs of a hexagonal tiling of the plane, and the resonance graph describes possible double-bond structures of these molecules. As show, hydrocarbons formed by chains of hexagons, linked edge-to-edge with no three adjacent hexagons in a line, have resonance graphs that are exactly the Fibonacci graphs.
More generally described the class of planar bipartite graphs that have Fibonacci cubes as their resonance graphs.
Related graphs.
Generalized Fibonacci cubes were presented by based on the k-th order Fibonacci numbers, which were later further extended to a larger class of networks called the Linear Recursive Networks by based on more general forms of linear recursions. modified the second order Fibonacci cubes based on different initial conditions. Another related graph is the Lucas cube, a graph with a Lucas number of vertices defined from the Fibonacci cube by forbidding a 1 bit in both the first and last positions of each bitstring; investigated the coloring properties of both Fibonacci cubes and Lucas cubes.

Alfred L. Pearson

Alfred Lawrence Pearson (December 28, 1838–January 6, 1903) was a lawyer and Union Army general in the American Civil War. He was awarded the U.S. military's highest decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his actions at the Battle of Lewis's Farm.
Biography.
Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Pearson studied law at Meadville College and Jefferson College. He was admitted to the Allegheny County bar on January 14, 1862, but worked in the profession for only a few months before leaving to join the army.
He enlisted in the 155th Pennsylvania Infantry on April 2, 1862, and was commissioned a captain in Company A later that year, on August 23. Over the next few years he took part in all of his regiment's operations and received a series of promotions: to major on December 31, 1862, to lieutenant colonel on July 22, 1863, and to colonel on August 31, 1863. On December 14, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Pearson for appointment to the brevet grade of brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from September 30, 1864, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on February 14, 1865.
On March 29, 1865, in the last weeks of the war, Pearson participated in the Battle of Lewis's Farm in Virginia. When a Union brigade was pushed back by intense Confederate fire, Pearson rallied his regiment and led an attack which successfully regained the lost ground. For these actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor several decades later, on September 17, 1897. In the last months of his military service he commanded the 3rd Brigade and later the 1st Brigade of 1st Division, V Corps. He was mustered out of the Army on June 2, 1865. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Pearson for appointment to the brevet grade of major general of volunteers to rank from May 1, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.
After the war Pearson returned to Pittsburgh and resumed the practice of law. He was elected Allegheny County's district attorney in October 1868 and served in that post until health problems forced him to retire from the legal profession. He later worked as a county gas inspector. Pearson was appointed a major general in the Pennsylvania National Guard in 1870 and placed in command of the 6th Division. He served in that capacity during the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, in which dozens of rioters were killed when his troops opened fire.
Pearson was active in veterans' affairs and was for many years a manager of the National Soldiers' Home. He was one of the organizers of the Grand Army of the Republic and was commander of the group's Department of Pennsylvania. He helped organize another veterans' group, the Union Veteran Legion, and was its first national commander. He was also a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion and the Medal of Honor Legion.
Pearson married Elizabeth Harwood Stewart and had a son, Alfred Laurence Pearson, who went on to become a successful businessman. He died on January 6, 1903, at age 64 and was buried at Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh.
Medal of Honor citation.
Pearson's official Medal of Honor citation reads:
Seeing a brigade forced back by the enemy, he seized his regimental color, called on his men to follow him, and advanced upon the enemy under a severe fire. The whole brigade took up the advance, the lost ground was regained, and the enemy was repulsed.

2009 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup qualification

This page details the qualification process for the 2009 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup.
The tournament proper features teams from the top five levels of the American Soccer Pyramid. These five levels, namely Major League Soccer, the United Soccer Leagues (First Division, Second Division, and Premier Development League), and the United States Adult Soccer Association, each have their own separate qualification process to trim their ranks down to their final eight team delegations in the months leading up to the start of the tournament proper. It is expected that eight teams from each level will compete in the tournament proper, with the eight clubs from MLS receiving byes into the Third Round.
The qualifying process for MLS will take the form of an eight-team play-off tournament. The top six finishers, regardless of conference, in 2008 were given six of the berths into the Third Round. The eight remaining U.S.-based clubs will compete for the final two berths via a playoff.
Continuing the format of recent seasons, no qualification process will be needed for USL-1 and USL-2 as each level has exactly eight U.S.-based clubs for the 2009 season. The PDL has announced that selected early season games will again double as qualifying matches, as they had in recent years. Each conference will be given two berths that will be awarded to the best team in each division.
The qualifying process for the USASA will take the form of four regional tournaments. Assuming the continuation of recent seasons' format, the two finalists in each region will be awarded berths.
Tier 1: Major League Soccer (MLS).
Schedule.
Note: Scorelines use the standard U.S. convention of placing the home team on the right-hand side of box scores.
Qualification Finals.
"D.C. United qualify for the Third round."
"Seattle Sounders F.C. qualify for the Third round."
Tier 2: USL-1 and Tier 3: USL-2.
No qualification is necessary for USL-1 and USL-2 since each level has eight U.S.-based clubs for the 2009 season.
Tier 4: USL Premier Development League (PDL).

Otto Kleinschmidt

Otto Kleinschmidt (13 December 1870 – 25 March 1954) was a German ornithologist, theologist and pastor. He introduced a typological species concept into German ornithology. His "Formenkreis theory" influenced the early ideas of Erwin Stresemann. Others have considered him one of the first biogeographers. His position was that similar "forms" (species) found in geographically distant regions could be accounted for by "formation rings" – with a fixed set of characters. This allowed him to support creationism while explaining biogeographical similarities.
Otto Kleinschmidt was born as the son of the fabric administrator Adolph Kleinschmidt and his wife Elise (maiden name Dreydorf) in Geinsheim (Kornsand) on the Rhine. The house of the family was located miles from anywhere in between unspoiled countryside. Otto Kleinschmidt was already as a young boy highly interested in nature and the world of the birds. Besides that it was kind of a family tradition to research and collect. Already at the age of 8 Otto prepared his first taxidermied birds.

Controversy.
Clemmons entered the national spotlight during a case challenging whether a South Carolina Voter ID law he worked on while in the House of Representatives violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act. During testimony in the proceeding, Clemmons stated that he responded to an e-mail from a man named Ed Koziol saying, "Amen, Ed, thank you for your support." A portion of the email from Kozoil stated that if the legislature offered a reward for identification cards, “it would be like a swarm of bees going after a watermelon.”

Yannis Tamtakos

Yannis Tamtakos () (1908 – January 4, 2008) was a Greek political activist, initially of Trotskyism and later of Anarchism. Due to his political activity, he was chased by the Greek state and Stalinists. For quite a few years before his death, he was the oldest survivor among the active participants of the great strike of 1936, in Thessaloniki.
Biography.
He was born in 1908, in Foça, Ottoman Empire. In 1914, his family fled persecutions of Anatolian Greeks to Greece, and he was forced to earn his living as a street vendor of simits and later as a shoeshiner. In 1918-1919, aged 11, he participated in a workers' manifestation for the 1st of May, in the district of Evangelistria, Thessaloniki, for the first time. He had his first contact with supporters of Archeio-Marxism in 1924.
He took part in every workers' struggle in Thessaloniki, as a shoemaker, having been elected committee member (1926–1927) and a secretary (1928–1929) of the Union of the Shoe-makers of Thessaloniki. Later, he got active through the union of the unemployed. In 1931, while on the frontline of a demonstration of the unemployed, in Syntrivani Square in Thessaloniki, he was attacked by a group of policemen, led by the nephew of the Head of the Police; the former shot him in the cheek and the bullet cut his tongue. He didn't lose his ability to speak, thanks to sub-consequent surgeries.
In 1936, after the violent suppression of the workers' revolt, he was found guilty by the Felony Court of Edessa, along with another 52 workers, as organiser of the Thessaloniki strike, on May 1936. He was sent into internal exile, based on the "idionymon" law, from 1937 to 1942. The Tsouderos government, before fleeing the country in April 1941, exiled him to Gavdos. A lot of his fellow detainees who had been exiled in Gavdos, were handed over to the German occupation authorities and later executed during the Axis Occupation of Greece in Kaisariani and Nezero of Lamia, including Pandelis Pouliopoulos, the onetime secretary of the Communist Party of Greece and leader of the Trotskyist branch. Tamtakos skipped the prosecution by escaping from the police transfer detainment center and lived as an outlaw, after that.
Identifying himself as a revolutionary, he didn't fight in the Second World War, because he believed that the National Liberation Front was working in favour of the self-exiled Greek government, in order to liberate the Greek middle class. In 1942, he met Cornelius Castoriadis and adopted his opinion on the bureaucratisation of the Communist Parties. Based on these positions, he quit Troskyism in 1947. Along with his comrades, Agis Stinas, Dimosthenis Voursoukis, Makris, Krokos, Castoriadis et al., he believed in the principles of defeatism and of revolutionary internationalism, by promoting an autonomous, self-organised society and asking for the alliance among all of the fighting soldiers. Due to this position, Tamtakos and his comrades were persecuted by the German occupiers, the "Chites" (Greek right-wing collaborators of the occupiers) and the Communists. He managed to escape assassination efforts by OPLA quite a few times while he used several identities and nicknames during the period of the ideological cleansing.
He left Greece in 1951, having been invited to work as an immigrant in Australia, where he was employed in the factory of General Motors. He returned to Greece in 1966, where he stayed for the rest of his life.
During the 80s, he was ideologically and politically connected with the antiauthoritarian scene of Thessaloniki. Despite his age, he took part in every workers manifestation in the city.
He died on the January 4, 2008, a few days before his 100th birthday and his political funeral was held the next day, in the cemetery of Malakopi.
Published material.
His book "Memories of a life in the revolutionary movement", which was published on March 2003, contains transcripts of recorded self-biographic tellings, including references to historical and political events of the last century. Part of his personal diary has been published in 1995, in the "Alfa" newspaper.
Yannis Tamtakos was one of the main characters in the movie "Coursal", directed by Nikos Theodossiou.

<doc id="21616857" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21616857" title="Housing in India">
Housing in India

Housing in India varies greatly and reflects the socio-economic mix of its vast population.
Housing varies from palaces of erstwhile maharajas in Rajasthan to modern apartment buildings in big cities to tiny huts in far-flung villages. There has been tremendous growth in India's housing sector as incomes have risen.
There are certain unique characteristics of Indian culture which often influence how Indian homes are organised. A common traditional structure is for the extended family to live in the same house, forming what is known in India as a joint family For instance grandparents, their sons, daughters-in-law and grandchildren live in the same household sharing the same kitchen. Brothers, sisters and cousins grow up together. Each husband-wife combination has their own bedroom. The eldest woman in the house is generally incharge of cooking. In joint families, women live with their in-laws after marriage.
With modernisation there is a growing number of nuclear families, in which each couple occupies its own house after marriage, in urban areas. It is still rare, albeit not impossible, amongst traditional communities for senior citizens to live alone. It is extremely rare even in urban areas for couples to live together before marriage. Some single young adults live in same-sex dormitories or in shared accommodation during college and the early working years.
The life-style in villages takes advantage of the warm weather. Many families bathe outdoors in rivers and ponds. Most of the day is spent outdoors around or near the house. Cooking is conducted outdoors in earthen stoves powered by organic fuels or in modern kerosene stoves. Water is obtained from hand-drawn wells. Men perform their ablutions in designated spots throughout the day; Visitors to villages may find residents squatting down for an afternoon card game under trees or while sitting on charpois (traditional hand-made beds) brought outside during the day. Consequently they use their indoor space primarily to sleep, change and, in electrified homes, to watch TV.
Low income housing.
According to the "Times of India", "a majority of Indians have per capita space equivalent to or less than a 10 feet x 10 feet room for their living, sleeping, cooking, washing and toilet needs." The average is 103 sq ft per person in rural areas and 117 sq ft per person in urban areas.
44 percent of rural households have access to electricity. Although cities have better facilities than villages, except for the major metros, no city in India provides full-day water supply.
States such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and others provides continuous power supply. Some 400 million Indians do not have access to a proper toilet and the situation is even worse in slums across Indian cities.
Funding.
The national and state governments are running programs, some funded by the World Bank, to improve conditions. Bharat Nirman is targeting clean water, the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission is building public toilets and sewage systems. The private sector, including companies such as Tata, have started to enter the low-income residential projects.
World Bank.
In 2013, the Government of India and National Housing Bank borrowed US $100 million to fund their Low Income Housing Finance project. The money will be loaned to low income residents who wish to purchase or renovate a home.
Cities.
Mumbai.
Mumbai experiences similar urbanisation challenges as other fast growing cities in developing countries: wide disparities in housing between the affluent, middle-income and low-income segments of the population.
Highly desirable neighbourhoods such as Colaba, Malabar Hill, Marine Drive, Bandra and Juhu house professionals, industrialists, Bollywood movie stars and expatriates. Up-scale flats have 3 or more bedrooms, ocean views, tasteful interior decoration, parking for luxury cars and sleeping quarters for maids and cooks. . In 2007, Mumbai condominiums were the priciest in the developing world at around US$9,000 to US$10,200 per square metre. Mumbai has more than 1,500 high rise buildings, many of which are just planned, but some already constructed or under construction.
Despite the recent economic growth, there is still vast poverty, unemployment and therefore poor housing conditions for a huge section of the population. With available space at a premium, working-class Mumbai residents often reside in cramped and poor quality, yet relatively expensive housing, usually far from workplaces. Despite this, Mumbai's economic boom continues to attract migrants in search of opportunities from across the country. The number of migrants to Mumbai from outside Maharashtra during the 1991–2001 decade was 1.12 million, which amounted to 54.8% of the net addition to the population of Mumbai.
Over 9 million people, over 60% of the population of Mumbai, live in informal housing or slums, yet they cover only 6–8% of the city's land area. Slum growth rate in Mumbai is greater than the general urban growth rate.
Financial Times writes that "Dharavi is the grand panjandrum of the Mumbai slums". Dharavi, Asia's second largest slum is located in central Mumbai and houses over 1 million people. Slums are a growing tourist attraction in Mumbai.
Most of the remaining live in chawls and on footpaths. Chawls are a quintessentially Mumbai phenomenon of multi-storied terrible quality tenements, typically a bit higher quality than slums. 80 per cent of chawls have only one room. Pavement dwellers refers to Mumbai dwellings built on the footpaths/pavements of city streets.
With rising incomes, many residents of slums and chawls now have modern amenities such as mobile phones, access to electricity, often illegally, and television.
Rent control laws have helped to create a housing shortage.
Delhi.
Delhi has witnessed rapid suburban growth over the past decade. South Delhi, Gurgaon and Noida have added thousands of apartment buildings, houses, shopping centres and highways. New Delhi's famous Lutyens bungalows house the prime minister, members of his cabinet, top political and government leaders, military officials, senior judges and top bureaucrats. New Delhi is also home to thousands of diplomatic staff of foreign countries and the United Nations. With India's growth, Delhi has developed into a business centre, especially for outsourcing, IT consultancy, high-tech, research, education and health care services. Employees of these institutions are the source of growing demand for high-end housing provided by major builders such as DLF.
Roughly 18.7% of Delhi's population lives in slums, according to 2001 government statistics.
Bangalore.
In the 1990s the information technology boom hit Bangalore. Y2K projects in America's IT industry resulted in shortages for skilled computer scientists and systems programmers. Bangalore has transformed into the Silicon Valley of India as over 500,000 well-paying jobs for young college graduates were created. The demographics of the city changed, new high-rise residential buildings were built, campus-style office parks sprouted, vast shopping centres started to thrive, streets became crowded with new cars and gated expatriate housing estates emerged.
Roughly 3% of Bangalore's population lives in slums.
Kolkata (Calcutta).
The most sought-after neighbourhoods of Calcutta are generally centred around Park Street, Camac Street, Lower Circular Road, Sarat Bose Road, Salt Lake, Ballygunge, Anwar Shah Road, Chowringhee and Golf Green. A recent building boom has converted sprawling British-era bungalows into high-rise condominiums and apartment-buildings with modern amenities. Kolkata currently has the second most number of highrises and tall buildings in the country, second only to Mumbai. The highest of them is at 50 floors (under construction). New suburbs are constantly being developed in Rajarhat and along the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. Once completed, these suburbs shall consist partially of major condominiums, complete with penthouses, many designed primarily for NRIs, expats and wealthier residents. Avani is also a major builder. The tallest buildings in the city, The South City Towers, are also condominiums.
North Calcutta contains mansions built in the early 20th century during Calcutta's heyday as capital of British India, which covered all of South Asia plus Burma and Aden. These buildings include a courtyard surrounded by balconies, large rooms with tall ceilings, marble floors, tall pillars and crumbling artwork. Most of them are poorly maintained. The Marble Palace and other buildings received "heritage status" which provides them municipal funds and incentives to repair and restore. These mansions serve as reminder of the era of Bengali Renaissance when Tagore's music and dance graced the living rooms of wealthy Bengali merchants.
Chennai.
In Chennai, houses are generally quite modernised. A basic single, or sometimes double, occupation flat in Chennai consist of Single bedroom with hall, kitchen and attached washroom. This ranges from 1BH to 5BH even 8BH. According to the survey, carried out by the census in 2011, Chennai is one of the cities in India which have very low slum population.The survey reported that as low as 10% of the slum population is present in India. Chennai is the second largest city which has very low slum population, preceded by Bangalore.
Hyderabad.
In Hyderabad, housing in modern ages in the 21st century is more modernised and developed than it has been in the past. The housing sector in Hyderabad has relatively sophisticated infrastructure. and is suitable for gated communities and villas, as well as higher-standard flats and condominiums. Hyderabad is home to several skyscrapers, including The Botanika, Lodha Belezza, etc. Many residential infrastructure companies are well-established in Hyderabad.
Corruption.
In general India's crime rates trails those of other developing countries. There is a large developed housing market with major builders and promoters. Some municipal and other government officials, elected politicians, real estate developers and a few law enforcement officials, acquire, develop and sell land in illegal ways. Sometimes, government land or land ostensibly acquired for some legitimate government purpose is then handed over to real estate developers who build commercial and residential properties and sell them in the open market, with the connivance of a small section of the administrative and police officials. In one set of allegations in Karnataka, a lake was filled in and government buildings torn down after illegal transfers to a developer by mafia-connected officials. Eminent domain laws, intended to procure private land at relatively low prices for public benefit or redistribution to poorer people under social justice programs, are abused to pressure existing landholders to sell land to a government entity, which transfers the land to developers at those low prices, and who in turn sell it back on the market at much higher prices.
Corruption is sometimes a reaction to well-meaning social activists' opposition to development. Environmentalists, "not in my backyard" activists and court cases slow down the ability to expand housing. The computerisation of records relating to the classification of tracts and land ownership is a key tool in countering the illegal activities of land mafias, since it creates transparency on all information relating to a given parcel of land. This approach has been effective in Bangalore, but efforts to extend it elsewhere have sometimes met with strong resistance by land mafias, manifesting itself as bureaucratic inaction.

I Feel Cream

I Feel Cream is the fifth studio album by Canadian recording artist Peaches, released on April 30, 2009 by XL Recordings. The album was produced by Simian Mobile Disco, as well as Soulwax, Digitalism, Shapemod and Drums of Death.
Promotion.
In summer 2007, German band Sweet Machine was asked by Peaches to join her as her backing band for one show at the Berlin Festival. After this successful collaboration, Sweet Machine became her new full-time backing band. They performed together at the Exotic Erotic Ball 2007, the Hard New Year's Eve 2007 and also joined her Australia and New Zealand tour in 2008. In 2009, they teamed up again for a Peaches' "I Feel Cream" tour. Peaches and Sweet Machine also toured as part of the festivals Festival Internacional de Benicàssim and Get Loaded in the Park in August 2009. In 2010, Peaches and Sweet Machine once again toured Australia performing at the sold out Big Day Out festivals and at a series of sideshows. Peaches was supported on this tour by Shunda K who performed their collaboration "Billionaire", and was also the opening act.
On November 6, 2009, Peaches appeared on the "Last Call with Carson Daly", where she performed the song "Talk to Me".
To promote "I Feel Cream", Peaches released a music video for every song from the album. Musical group SSION directed and starred in a "Wizard of Oz"-themed video for "Billionaire" that also features Shunda K of Yo Majesty. The video for "Show Stopper" was directed by Caroline Sascha Cogez, and stars Danish film actress Charlotte Munck. In the video, Peaches references and sings a snippet of Nina Hagen's song "New York / N.Y."
"Mud" was used in "The Vampire Diaries" episode "The Night of the Comet" and "Show Stopper" was featured in the "Gossip Girl" episode "How to Succeed in Bassness".
"Mommy Complex" was used in an ad for the Citroën DS3 in 2012.
Singles.
The first single is a double A-side of "Talk to Me" and "More". "Talk to Me" peaked at number fifty-one on the Austrian Singles Chart and at number ninety-nine on the French Singles Chart.
"Lose You" was released as the album's second single in the UK on July 5, 2009. The song became a dance hit in Belgium, peaking at number eleven on the Belgian Dance Chart.
The third single "I Feel Cream" was released on November 9, 2009.
"Relax" was given a music video, but not released as a single.
Critical reception.
"I Feel Cream" received mostly favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 74, based on 22 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews". Allmusic's Heather Phares gave "I Feel Cream" four out of five stars, noting that the album has "plenty of moments that aren't groundbreaking, but still show that Merill Nisker has a lot to say about sex, music, and pop culture nearly a decade after "Teaches of Peaches" was released." "Los Angeles Times" Margaret Wappler commented that on "I Feel Cream", Peaches "drops the Iggy Pop fetishism that distracted her last couple of albums and engages in elemental club throbbers, stripped down to equal parts fire and ice." She continued, "At times the minimalist compositions expose her limited range, but no one should be listening to Peaches for the pitch-defying melismas." Matthew Perpetua of Pitchfork Media opined, "Whereas it was beginning to seem that Peaches' shtick was an artistic dead end, there is now plenty of reason to believe that she may have the skills and vision necessary to produce interesting, emotionally affecting work well beyond menopause." Likewise, Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson rated the album three-and-a-half out of five stars, claiming that "maybe age "has" softened Peaches a tad, but if "I Feel Cream" is the result, it sounds more compelling and radical than any number of new iterations of 'sucking on my titties.'"
"The Times" critic Peter Paphides gave the album four out of five stars, expressing that "what strikes you on "I Feel Cream" is just how merely existing in a post-Gossip musical firmament has brought the Toronto singer's carnally empowered monologues within waving distance of the mainstream. And yet, with the exception of the clammy, catchy remonstrations of 'Talk to Me', this remains an album firmly rooted in the lineage of great electronic dance music." Tim Chester of the "NME" rated the album seven out of ten and wrote that "he notoriously hardcore sexual aggressor has swapped strap-ons for sentiment and turned all flaccid in the process, and guess what: it's quite... nice." "Rolling Stone"s Caryn Ganz described the album as "part Lil' Kim, part Lita Ford and all hot mess" and added, "Though it hits only a few different notes, Peaches' bawdy pop feels like a refreshing breath of filthy air." In a review for PopMatters, Erin Lyndal Martin referred to "I Feel Cream" as "a fun and worthwhile album, though is unlikely to change any minds about Peaches. Fortunately, that also means she shows no signs of losing her touch." Emma Warren of "The Observer" gave the album three out of five stars, stating, "Ideology aside, this is a diverse album that retains her trademark dirty electro but on collaborations with Simian Mobile Disco still delights." However, Genevieve Koski of "The A.V. Club" graded the album an B− and felt that it "feels subdued and safe, a less-than-inspiring move for an artist who made her name by being neither." Drowned in Sound's Alexander Tudor rated "I Feel Cream" six out of ten and concluded, "Ultimately, Peaches shows herself developing, late in her career, but unlikely to infiltrate the market she's targeted."
"Iguana" magazine placed "I Feel Cream" at number 141 on its Albums of the Year 2009 list. It was ranked number 277 on "The Village Voice"s Pazz & Jop critics' poll of 2009.
"Spin" listed the album at number six on its 20 Worst Album Titles of 2009 list, writing, "Keep it in your hot pants, Merrill, you're 42."
