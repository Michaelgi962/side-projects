MyYearbook Hits Half A Million Daily Mobile Users, Launches iPad App
2011/12/16
It’s hard being a social network not called Facebook, but myYearbook isn’t one of those erstwhile rivals being sold off for assets. Instead, it’s been seeing strong mobile growth and revenue growth over the last year, building on its $100 million merger with QuePasa in July. Expect both to accelerate with the launch of its new iPad app today (available here). The company is now reaching half a million mobile users daily across major operating systems, chief operating officer and cofounder Geoff Cook tells me, with 200 million (unduplicated) monthly sessions in total. Android has grown to be the largest, beating iPhone usage by two to one. The set of mobile app developer acquisitions that the company did earlier this year seems to be paying off.  Revenue is also up. After posting revenues of $23.7 million last year, it’s grown to $36.3 million in the 12-month span through September. The new iPad app, which you can download here, improves on the existing mobile interfaces by adding a multi-pane interface for doing things like flipping through profiles while using specific features like apps. Look for it to get more of the main myYearbook.com site features early next year, Cook says. MyYearbook has transitioned from its roots as a high school social network to, in its words, the place to “meet new people near you.” That obviously translates to lots of dating-oriented features. It’s been launching games and other apps in-house, powered by its own virtual currency, that are designed to bring strangers together.  The iPad app already has some of those features in place, but so far it’s been monetizing through ads. The virtual currency is coming to mobile next quarter, Cook says, along with the games, which should help mobile monetization increase considerably. Dating apps, including mobile ones, have been quiet but substantial businesses. Cook also says that the iPad launch should be a hit with its users, a company survey recently showed that a large percentage of them are expecting iPads from Christmas. He’s aiming for a repeat of last year, when the sales of iPod Touches helped fuel the year’s growth.  Latest headlines delivered to you daily

Greenville’s New TechStars Network Member “The Next Big Thing” Now Open For
2011/12/16
Today, another TechStars Network accelerator comes online. Greenville, South Carolina’s “The Next Big Thing,” as it’s called, has been running in stealth mode since its founding in February 2011. But now, the incubator is ready for submissions. Companies can apply for the program starting today up until the window’s closing on April 20th. The Next Big Thing’s initial program will begin in summer 2012, culminating in a Demo Day in September. Like all TechStars Network affiliates, The Next Big Thing will provide those granted admission with support and capital to help get their startups off the ground. In this case, companies receive office space, mentorship, free legal and accounting work and $18,000 per team in seed funding. They will also receive around $75,000 in freebies and discounts from partners. In exchange, The Next Big Thing takes the typical 6% stake in each startup it invests in. The accelerator has lined up some significant mentors to kick off its launch, including Brad Feld, Bo Fishback, Ryan Carson, Hiten Shah, Eric Marcoullier, Lloyd Taylor and many others. In addition to its own startups, the accelerator also invests in other startups, usually graduates of similar accelerator program. Currently, it has invested in FullContact (TechStars Boulder 2011) and is closing on two investments from TechStars NY. The unique thing about this incubator is that it’s also hiring five designers skilled in one or more of the following: IA/UX, identity design, illustration, graphic/print design, HTML, CSS, Javascript/JQuery, video production and animation. The designers will be employed by the The Next Big Thing but will work with the teams individually. They will also be encouraged to join the program’s startups or launch their own, says TNBT Managing Director Peter Barth. Barth, an alumnus of Vanderbilt University, where he studied computer engineering, spent a couple of years on Wall St. as a registered options principal and general securities principal at Duke & Company and Morgan Stanley. But he soon realized that he really was a hacker at heart and he moved away to Indianapolis, taking a development position with SinglePoint. He worked his way up to CTO then purchased a stake in the business. In 2006, he relocated to Greenville and has been involved with the development of NEXT, the NEXT Innovation Center, InternGreenville, and now, The Next Big Thing. Other members of TNBT’s advisory board are detailed here. Interested startups can now apply for The Next Big Thing here. Latest headlines delivered to you daily

Kinek Goes Mobile: Lets Online Shoppers Pick Up At Local Stores
2011/12/16
Doing some online shopping but don’t want the package shipped to your house? Maybe you won’t be home, or worry about packages left on your doorstep. Or maybe the package is a gift for someone in your household? Here’s a cool idea: pick up your online orders at a local store instead. That’s the premise of the young startup called Kinek, which has partnered with a number of brick-and-mortar stores across the U.S. and Canada to serve as “KinekPoints” – secure locations where you can pick up your deliveries. Now, the company is releasing its first iPhone application, allowing you to find nearby KinekPoints, check their hours, get directions, track packages and receive push notifications when the package has arrived. For consumers, there’s no monthly or sign-up fee to use Kinek, but there’s sometimes a small per-package fee applied by the individual KinekPoint location. The high range for the fee isn’t too bad – usually around $5 for a regular-sized package. Some retailers don’t charge a fee at all, though, because they benefit from the foot traffic that comes from being a KinekPoint. However, all retailers have to pay to be a KinekPoint partner on a per-parcel basis. Currently, Kinek has partnered with brick-and-mortar retailers including Medfast, Storage-mart, Pharmasave, and DoItBest (the latter two in select locations only, not the entire chain). It has also partnered with online retailers Sierra Trading Post and Monoprice to provide online shoppers with an alternative shipping address when the company doesn’t ship to their home. The company now has over a thousand locations across 42 U.S. states and nearly all Canadian provinces. KinekPoints are most popular in major metro areas like San Francisco (73), Los Angeles (59), Chicago (32), San Diego (30), Kansas City (28), Atlanta (27), Miami (27), Toronto (24), Dallas (23), Washington D.C. (23), New York (22), Philadelphia (14),  Seattle (13), Orlando (12) and Montreal (10). But it has really taken off in rural areas along the U.S./Canadian border, as it offers Canadians a way to avoid international shipping and handling fees. They just have the package sent to their favorite KinekPoint address, then drive across the border to pick it up. The iPhone app serves as a great complement to this handy service, especially because it provides mobile access to package tracking and push notifications. You can choose to have messages sent to you via SMS and email, too, if you prefer. Kinek launched in December 2009, and was started by CEO Dr. Kerry McLellan, Ph.D., who is also CEO of Applepeak Inc. and owner of Clean Earth Ltd. He previously was COO of 724 solutions from 1998-2000. Kinek is personally funded by McLellan, but is in talks with investors at this time. The idea for the startup clearly has merit – after all, Amazon is doing the same thing. The Internet retailer has been testing a “delivery locker” system at select 7-Eleven stores in the U.S. in recent months where the convenience store serves as sort of a 24/7 post office for Amazon order pick-ups. You can grab the new Kinek for iPhone here. Latest headlines delivered to you daily

Curate Your Own Digital Magazine With Scoop.it For iPhone
2011/12/16
News curation startup Scoop.it has arrived on the iPhone today, allowing you to create your own digital magazine while on the go. The app, which works alongside the Scoop.it web service, essentially lets anyone be a publisher for any topic. Or perhaps, the more correct word is not “publisher,” it’s “aggregator.” Scoop.it “publishers” aren’t always writing and producing their own content, although that is an option. But Scoop.it’s main focus is on its content aggregation tools. Publishers select the best content from around the web and then publish it in a magazine-like format that looks similar to something created by Pressly or OnSwipe. Previously, this curation process was done either through a browser bookmarklet, by accepting content submission from others, or by accepting a post suggested by Scoop.it’s own recommendation engine. Now, with the new iPhone app, curation can be done from your mobile, too. Using the app, Scoop.it users can select, edit and publish posts, review suggestions and share to their connected Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr accounts. The app is a handy companion for Scoop.it itself, but only for those who already have their magazine up-and-running. You have to first set up your magazine’s topics via the web – you can’t begin the process using the app. That’s a shame since, for many people, the first time they’ll ever encounter Scoop.it is via the App Store. News aggregation can be a touchy topic – is it right to re-publish others’ work and brand it as your own, even if you’re sending the sites traffic? Some would say no. But aggregation has proved a successful business model in many cases, and the human-assisted curation that accompanies it, such as what’s provided by Techmeme for example, makes curation a form of content creation itself. Who’s to say that Scoop.it couldn’t form the basis of a thousand tiny, niche Techmeme’s in the future? Scoop.it is currently a freemium service. Individuals can publish up to 5 topics per account, but have to use Scoop.it’s own branding. Business accounts offer more topics and features, including domain hosting and analytics for $79/month. The Scoop.it iPhone app is here. Latest headlines delivered to you daily

The Echo Nest To Power New Spotify Radio (Which Begins Rolling Out Today)
2011/12/16
For a long time now, Spotify has had its own Radio experience, but, to be honest, it hasn’t been very good. Then, last week, the Swedish-turned-America music service announced that it was redesigning its radio experience from the ground up, offering unlimited stations and unlimited “skips”. And it’s no mistake that, during his presentation of the new Spotify Radio, CEO Daniel Ek happened to compare his app to Pandora. Since its IPO, Pandora has been on a kick, but Spotify is doing everything it can to continue nipping at its heels and has added 7 million new users since integrating with Facebook at f8.  At the end of November, Spotify hosted its first big American event, announcing a “new direction” for the service. A big part of this is Spotify’s new platform for third party developers, who are now able to integrate Spotify’s massive collection of music into their own apps. And today, Spotify will begin officially rolling out “Radio” to its users on top of its new app platform. But, what Spotify hasn’t been talking about until today is what kind of technology is powering its awesome redesigned Radio functionality. Enter: The Echo Nest, a music intelligence startup whose technology powers many music apps from media companies and independent developers. The Echo Nest is now providing its music intelligence technology to power intelligent radio and radio playlisting within the new Spotify Radio app as it rolls out today across the country. Given The Echo Nest’s relationship with app developers and record labels (it recently partnered with EMI to open its catalog to app developers), this relationship makes a lot of sense. The Echo Nest will now essentially be powering Spotify Radio, allowing users to create personalized radio stations based around songs or artists in Spotify’s roster of over 15 million tracks.  Partnering with The Echo Nest allows Spotify to enable users to build playlists dynamically around any song or artist for a far deeper radio experience than Spotify has offered previously. As The Echo Nest has one of the more sophisticated playlist engines out there, combining this playlist intelligence with Spotify’s huge catalog and deep social integration should definitely give Pandora pause.  Users will be able to find Spotify Radio located within Spotify Apps, which will now be available to users of its free service as well as Unlimited and Premium Subscription users.

Now At 1.4M Members, Fab.com Turns Up The Social With A ‘Live Feed’
2011/12/16
Exclusive – Fab.com, the ridiculously fast growing e-commerce startup, is launching a new social shopping feature today that lets members view and interact with any activity on the design flash sales site in real-time. Dubbed the ‘live feed’ and reminiscent of Facebook’s early iterations of what is now the News Feed, it captures what users are purchasing, sharing, commenting on etc. The live feed adds a powerful social component to the e-commerce activity happening on Fab.com. Importantly, while all activity on the site is shared with anyone visiting the live feed, users have the possibility to conceal their usernames when they buy or favorite something on the site. All people need to do to appear anonymously as “a Fab user” is flick a virtual switch on the top right. Fab.com founder and CEO Jason Goldberg tells me social activity is mighty important to the company; more than 50 percent of its now 1.4 million strong registered user base were introduced to the site by people sharing items for sale at Fab on social networks. You’ll notice that the feed refreshes constantly. No wonder, if you consider that Fab.com has attracted close to 1.5 million members and sold over 600,000 items in just six months. Goldberg tells me that the partners of Andreessen Horowitz, the VC firm that recently led a $40 million funding round for the company, have never seen an e-commerce site grow this fast. At present, Fab’s annual revenue run rate is roughly $70 million. Again, in just six months. The company employed 3 people in New York City back in February 2011, and now 90 (and 130 in total worldwide). The company just nabbed a former Etsy VP as COO, too. Finally, make sure you DO NOT MISS Goldberg’s blog post about the recent fundraising bonanza.

Fotopedia Shifts From iPad Books To Photozine With “Wild Friends” App
2011/12/15
Digital media is just more compelling when it is updated on a regular basis. That is what keeps people coming back. It’s as true for blogs as it is for apps.  Fotopedia has built a nice little franchise putting out digital photo books re-imagined for the iPad. After 9 apps and 6.2 million downloads, with 1.4 million active users and 100 million pageviews a month, it is taking a more magazine-liek apporach with its latest iPad app, “Wild Friends.”.  Instead of a relatively static set of highly-curated pictures around a single topic, you get a highly-curated set of pictures that changes every day.  And each photo now has a narrative caption written by the photographer. Fotopedia started experimenting with this more magazine-like approach in September with its HTML5 website and integration into Flipboard. You can see what the “Wild Friends” magazine looks like on the web also. By focusing on one topic area per photozine (animals, Japan, national parks), Fotopedia hopes to attract advertisers with rich magazine-like ads.  Delivering fresh content every day should give users a reason to visit more than 2.4 times per month (wich is the average). Fotopedia will eventually convert all of its existing apps into the magazine format as well, and soon will add Facebook Graph integration, which will allow readers who opt in to show every page they are browsing in their Facebook Tickers.

The New ZangZing Will Never Keep Your Photos Hostage
2011/12/15
I don’t know about you, but when I hear about another photo sharing app or website, my eyes roll back into my head, and I reflexively go into “screen saver mode”. There are just way too many options. How about Shutterfly, Kodak, Flickr, Instagram, Path, Twitter (TwitPic, Yfrog), Facebook, Google+, App Trover, GLMPS, Tracks, LiveShare, OpenPhoto — just to name a few. I don’t even like photos that much. So, when I heard about ZangZing, especially considering its name, I had the same reaction. However, back in April, Mike gave the pre-launch startup a ringing endorsement (granted, that was in comparison to Color), and Alexia backed up its private beta launch a few weeks later. So I pressed on. It also helps that ZangZing Co-founder and CEO Joseph Ansanelli has some serious startup cred under his belt, having founded and been CEO of four startups, one of which was acquired by Apple, another merged with Kana and went public, and then Vontu, which was acquired by Symantec for $350 million in 2007. “The world doesn’t need another Instagram-like photo streaming app and we are not that”, Ansanelli assures me. After all, photos are a huge category — Facebook sees over 250 million photos uploaded per day, and the CEO thinks there’s room for new services that redesign photo-sharing for a more traditional kind of user. And that’s ZangZing’s focus: The average photo user, not the uber adopter, people who care about ease of uploading, aggregating all their photos in one place, and privacy. Have a ton of photos on the soon-to-be-discontinued MobileMe? Ansanelli wants you to bring them to ZangZing all at once. And this last bit is what seems most interesting to me, not so much that ZangZing is now apparently importing one photo per second (after turning on one-click import), or that 70 photos is the average album size, it’s that 50 percent of the startup’s albums are currently private. Google+ launched to give users social circles within social circles, a “refined” mechanism for sharing content among specific groups of people.  In fact, Google acquired Katango to help them with that very problem. It’s a big, challenging goal that may never be solved completely — but ZangZing is yet another example that consumers want to share photos, just not with everyone, and founders want to try to bring them that experience. So, today, about eight months since the startup went into private beta, ZangZing is launching version 2.0 of its platform with some cool new features: Namely, one-click import from the majority of photo sites and social networks, including Facebook, Flickr, MobileMe, Instagram, Dropbox, Kodak Gallery, Shutterfly, etc. Just click “link”, and your photos arrive.  In this sense, ZangZing is really making a play at making it simple for users to add photos from anywhere, from a PC or Mac, Picasa Desktop, or iPhoto — giving users who feel their photos are “being held hostage” a chance to work within a more compatible platform. What’s more, you can email photos directly into a ZangZing album from any smartphone or any computer, or view photos in full-screen slideshows. And they won’t make you pay if you want to get your photos back. And, while Flickr has a bit of group sharing, it doesn’t work so well with one-time events, as Mike pointed out. With ZangZing, if you want to create a group album from an event, you simply upload a picture of the event through email invite your friends, and presto. On top of this, like many file-sharing sites, ZangZing wants to add soem granularity to its privacy controls by allowing users to decide who can add, view, and download full-resolution photos. Like any good social photo repository, it allows commenting to enable chat and social interaction around particular photos, and offers both people and activity views to surface albums based on who created them or when they were created, respectively — great for photo discovery. Furthermore, every ZangZing photo album has its own privacy setting, so that public photos are available to everyone, hidden albums let only those who know the web address view the albums, as well as invite-only albums that require sign-in. There are also a number of email settings to allow or disallow invitations, social following, confirmations, ZangZing news, etc. And, best of all? There’s no advertising. Another important piece of the puzzle if ZangZing is to convince users already inundated with photo-sharing websites that its model has a long-term value proposition. Because it won’t be offering advertising, ZangZing offers a bit of eCommerce, as it contains a number of product options, like prints (and mounted prints), photo panels, framed photos, etc., with which users can select images from favorite albums, customize dimensions, and check out directly. If someone buys your image, you get paid. It will be interesting to see if ZangZing goes to a freemium model to support its revenue model, but one thing’s for sure, the site is easy to navigate, is designed well, and I think it offers enough differentiation that it can become a valuable alternative to some of the legacy photo sharing options. Plus, an API is on its way. But I’m just one man, check it out and let us know what you think.  Latest headlines delivered to you daily

Postmates Launches Courier Delivery Service To San Francisco
2011/12/15
Postmates is sort of like a modern version of the taxi dispatching software that Twitter creator Jack Dorsey had worked on as a kid. Except it’s available for businesses and consumers today in San Francisco, if you download its iPhone app (here). It lets you place an order for a delivery, notifies nearby couriers and bike messengers, then one of them accepts and picks up the package and brings it to you. Then you’ll get an email with a link that lets you track the delivery as it makes its way to you. Pricing is based on the item being delivered, distance, and other factors. It’s obviously also a lot like Uber. The service has been in closed beta with 50 or so businesses in the past months, with 1000 deliveries so far (check out this section of its site for more details on that). The first 100 readers here can get a $20 discount by using the following discount code: TECHCRUNCH. It was also a TechCrunch Disrupt finalist. The company, which was just founded in May, is also announcing a new round of $800,000 in funding from investors including Crosslink Capital, which follows a previous round of $750,000. Cofounder Bastian Lehmann tells me that the focus so far is local businesses, any company that wants to access its API, and consumers. While it’s looking at expanding to other cities in the next year, likely including New York and Los Angeles, it’s also looking at more sparsely populated areas, like suburbs. So far it’s been recruiting experienced couriers, but in those areas it could bring in less experienced people, he says. Here’s a visualization of the deliveries so far, with red being the heaviest usage. Looks like there are a lot of exports to the other parts of the Bay.  Latest headlines delivered to you daily

Billy Chasen on Startup Strategy

 Having launched two companies that have gone in dramatically different directions; one’s secured $7-million in funding (Turntable.fm) and another ceases to exist (Stickybits), Turntable.fm’s Billy Chasen wraps his Founder Stories conversation by lending advice to other founders and discusses the biggest challenge he’s currently facing. Chasen tells host Chris Dixon that finding and hiring those “A+ rockstars” is his toughest task. He says on the surface it seems simple, but “it is actually incredibly difficult and it takes a lot of time and it takes a lot of energy and you don’t want to make a mistake.” He compares the hiring process to dating, “you can’t be too forward, the other person if they are too forward it kind of scares you away, there is like this whole just kind of dance.” Switching topics, Chasen says it’s key for founders to receive early feedback from consumers. His recommendation? “Try and get things out as early as possible. Figure out what your minimum viable product is and just get it out the door.” Hammering the point home he says, “whatever it takes, get that product out there.” Make sure to watch the entire episode to hear additional insights, including traits Chasen says startups and employees share – and what founders should avoid when dealing with both.

PapayaMobile Launches “The Games Academy,” An Accelerator For Mobile, Social Game
2011/12/15
Mobile games network PapayaMobile is launching a new accelerator for mobile, social game developers called “The Games Academy,” which will kick off in Q1 2012. Like most accelerators, Papaya will be providing developers with office space, support from a team of industry veterans, legal advice and an opportunity to pitch VC’s. However, there won’t be any seed capital provided, nor is the company taking an equity stake in the startups who join. Instead, Papaya only requires the teams use its Social Game Engine in their game’s development. Then at the end of the program, a “winning” team will be awarded with a grand prize of 100,000 guaranteed downloads. That’s right – this isn’t your typical accelerator, The Games Academy is also a competition. While everyone benefits from the mentorship, training, the Academy’s QA lab, office space (in the Parisoma Innovations Loft located in SOMA), as well as access to legal and VC’s, only one company gets the big, big boost: 100,000 downloads. PapayaMobile’s Justin Mauldin says that the company feels comfortable that it can push that much traffic to the winning app with its promotions, but if need be, it can buy incentivized installs from someone like TapJoy to fulfill the promise. As for the instructors, PapayaMobile has lined up some notable experts to start: David “dc” Collier, President of Tokyo-based Pikkle and formerly the Business Creator for Namco Web&Mobile in Tokyo; Joel Breton; producer of Bomberman Live, Unreal, Duke Nukem, and Pirates of the Caribbean; John Szeder, VP of Engineering at hi5, previously from Digital Chocolate; Mark Wallace, lecturer in the Games Dept. at the Academy of Art University and formerly Conversation Manager for Second Life; and Charlie Huenergardt, also from the Academy of Art Univ., a 15-year veteran who has worked at Sega, Sony, 3DO, EA, Pirate Games, Crystal Dynamics, Shaba Games, and Page 44. The program will run for four months and will include both classroom-style training and individual attention. Says PapayaMobile CEO Si Shen, The Games Academy is a move made in direct response to a market that has been over-saturated by game investment funds. “At the end of the day, money is only half of the equation,” she says. “Creating, marketing, and distributing successful social games that monetize well on mobile involves many different approaches. We intend to share our knowledge and bring about a shift in the industry.” Partnering in the launch is Patrick Chung, Managing Director at SK Telecom Ventures, who will be advising teams on funding and how to launch their games in various markets. Game development community Design3 will offer The Games Academy’s syllabus and materials online for teams who wish to participate virtually.  And non-profit Applications for Good will be seeding one of the development teams to create apps that serve a public purpose. Applications are open now for interested developers and will be up year-round. Going forward, The Games Academy expects to host three cycles per year. Latest headlines delivered to you daily

Aiming To Be The ‘Groupon Of Groceries’, SavingStar Passes 1 Million Users In Under
2011/12/15
It’s been a pretty good ride so far for digital couponing startup SavingStar. The company launched its beta last August behind $2.3 million in financing from Flybridge Capital Partners, First Round Capital, and Founder Collective, with participation from angel investors like Ron Conway.  The investment saw the digital coupon startup change its name from SaveWave to SavingStar, which it followed up with its official launch in April of this year, backed again by an impressive round, this time $7 million in series B financing from its existing investors, before adding Buddy Media Founder and CEO Michael Lazerow to its Board of Directors in June. With nearly $10 million in funding and a strong leadership team in tow, SavingStar today added another milestone, announcing that it has surpassed 1 million active users in exactly 230 days, an achievement which its founders are quick to note it made faster than bigs like Groupon, Twitter (over 2 years), or Foursquare (just over a year). What’s more, since launching, over 100 brands, like Tropicana, Huggies, Cambell’s etc. have offered deals on SavingStar, with savings up to 50 percent off. But, cheerleading aside, what is it about this company that attracted this sizable early investment and led to this strong growth? SavingStar fancies itself — in the style of the times — as the “Groupon for groceries”, or, simply put, a mainstream service that targets the world’s every day digital coupon clippers in an effort to make it easy for them to save money at local grocery stores.  Picking up where many have said that Groupon leaves off, the startup recently launched a loyalty offer that allows users who buy a certain item multiple times at different locations to receive additional cashback on their purchases. This is on top of the fact that SavingStar provides exclusive deals on name brand grocery products, which are linked to shoppers’ loyalty cards at more than 100 grocery and drug store chains, which enable users to save without having to clip or print paper coupons.  Considering consumers spend over $550 billion annually on groceries, thousands of consumer packaged goods vie for customer attention, and newspaper coupon distribution on the decline, SavingStar thinks that its poised to take advantage of customer attention turning to web and mobile-based services not only for deals, but for digital coupons.  The benefit of its model for brands is that brands can promote their products to SavingStar’s audience for free, and the company only charges when a product is actually purchased. It also receives universal product code data from retailers in its network, which then enables it to match offers activated by consumers with in-store purchases linked to shoppers’ loyalty cards — in an effort to help brands close the so-called “redemption loop”.  On the flip side, for consumers, SavingStar is free to use; all shoppers need to do is register their grocery and drug loyalty cards on SavingStar.com or on the company’s iPhone or Android apps. The service then links the offers to their registered cards so that when they purchase items and use their cards, the value of each is deposited as savings into their SavingStar account, rather than at checkout. Once they accumulate more than $5 in savings, users can cash out with a direct deposit into their PayPal or bank accounts, receive an Amazon gift card, or make a donation to charity.  This is where SavingStar believes it can differentiate its service from other eCoupon networks, in that it links offers users select to all of their registered loyalty cards at the same time, as well as enabling users to take advantage of mobile offers. According to SavingStar Head of Marketing Josh Grossman, no other grocery-focused digital coupon companies can make the same claim on a national basis. (SavingStar works with 100+ retail chains nationally, and is the only service that works with loyalty cards from drugstores like CVS and Rite Aid.) With so much activity in the daily deal and group buying space, it’s great to see a young startup actually approaching digital coupons, a relatively old business in comparison, with a simple yet innovative approach — one that appeals to everyday shoppers. SavingStar is a startup to keep your eye on, as it will be interesting to see if it can capitalize on strong early growth. For more on the company, check ’em out at home here.

New Data From Pando Offers A Glimpse Into The Massive Global Growth Of Freemium Gaming
2011/12/15
Well, it looks like hardcore gamers would like to have a word with you, social and casual gamers. Yes, the stories in the media of late have been all about Rovio’s Angry Birds skyrocketing past half a billion downloads, or Zynga and its ilk overtaking social games. Both casual and social games have been growing like gangbusters, but the latest data from Pando Networks reveals some fairly serious growth in the free-to-play gaming industry across the globe. Free-to-play games, just another way of saying “freemium games” are, to clear up any confusion, any game that is free to download and monetized by in-game purchases. Today, in mobile and web apps (and really the consumer web), we are seeing the coming of age of the freemium model and, as a result, advertisers and developers are being forced to find new ways to create revenue and monetize their games, whether that be by way of mobile advertising, virtual goods, avatars, in-game rewards, or incentivized installs. Today’s data from Pando Networks, a game delivery network for free-to play massively-multiplayer-online (MMO) games, is showing that free-to-play games are growing exponentially, right alongside their casual and social game bretheren. For example, the company’s data shows that the number of gamers downloading free games has grown 450 percent from 2009 to 2011, as more than 38 million people will download an online game using Pando in 2011 — and over 70 million people have downloaded free games since 2009. (And that’s not including the 11+ million playing Blizzard’s World of Warcraft.) Again, this hockey-stick growth has resulted from an industry-wide transition from a paid to freemium model, as can be seen in online gaming by the likes of both Turbine’s Lord of the Rings Online and WoW, which have both taken to the land of the free — along with newer, popular games like League of Legends (by Riot). And, in case it still needs hammering home, the explosive growth in free-to-play games is far from an American-only phenomenon. According to Pando, from October 2009 to October 2011, downloads in the U.S. have grown from 4.8 million to 12.6 million (an increase of 162 percent), while Latin America has seen downloads increase by 595 percent, compared to the U.K., where growth has shot up by a whopping 1025 percent.  Furthermore, developing nations like Turkey are gobbling up an increasingly significant share of downloads, considering over the last year, the number of gamers in Turkey downloading free-to-play games today sits over 5 million — an increase of 534 percent since 2010 (and more than 14 percent of the country’s total population).  As Turkey’s infrastructure and connectivity continues to expand, the country’s freemium gaming market has exploded right in tandem, and currently shows no sign of slowing down. Surely, this is a great sign for freemium games and the international gaming market, but it does make on worry about Turkey’s overall productivity. Here’s to hoping GDP doesn’t slip at the hands of widespread MMO gaming adoption. Compared to the size of population, Turkey certainly has one of the fastest growing freemium gaming markets, compared to, say, France, which has seen its freemium gamers grow from 139K in 2009 to 2.6 million in 2011, and Poland, which grew from 145L to 1.5 million over the same period. While it’s been clear for some time now the extent to which mobile and online platforms are being used by the ever-increasing gaming population in Asia, there hasn’t yet been such a clear picture of the extent to which the freemium model is being adopted in other global regions. And, again, turning to other sources, Pando’s data also seems to be clearly in support of PopCap’s November study (via Informations Solutions Group) of the growing social gaming market in the U.S. and the U.K., which found that more than 118 million people now play social games once per week, and 81 million people play at least once a day (which is 68 percent of all social gamers). Of course, that’s nice, but what’s really important is that today 31 million players have purchase in-game currency, up 86 percent from the previous year. Not only that, but Flurry blogged back in September that freemium games are leading all of the app revenue models in the iOS and Android app economies, as they now account for more than 65 percent of app revenue. So, to sum up, in the event that you’ve missed out on the last two years of gaming trends, it seems that freemium has not only fully arrived, but it’s here to stay, it’s taken over your home, and it’s raising your kids.

Disruptive Payments Network Dwolla Now Provides Users With Instant Access To Cash
2011/12/15
Today, online and mobile payments platform Dwolla is launching what may be one of its biggest features yet: instant access to cash. Via the new opt-in setting called “Dwolla Instant,” users will be able to immediately deposit and send cash without the usual wait times associated with the mobile payment platform – typically a few days. To use Dwolla Instant, users must first enroll in the service, which requires a monthly $3 participation fee. This fee will begin from the day you switch on Dwolla Instant, but can be turned off  and on at will, without penalty. Once enabled, you can then send  money to a friend, pay a merchant, or deposit funds instantly. You’ll tell Dwolla what the funding source is for that initial transaction, and that will then be tied to your “Instant Balance.” Immediately afterwards, Dwolla will allow you to make the payment via your linked bank account (Dwolla’s preferred funding source). Alternately, you can choose to “pay Dwolla back later,” if need be. That’s similar to how a credit card would work, but it’s a heck of a lot cheaper. The late fee for  the “pay Dwolla back” option is only $5.00. And Dwolla works hard to make sure you don’t forget, with notifications and reminders, unlike credit card companies who thrive off late payments. The reason why the fee is so low is because Dwolla makes its money elsewhere. It charges $0.25 per transaction, except for transactions under $10, which recently became free.  According to Dwolla CEO, Ben Milne, the reason why high fees exist in credit card networks has to do with legacy issues – the hardware, the infrastructure, and the resources needed to fight the rampant fraud associated with having your 16-digit card number just out there in the world, everywhere. “Creating a new network is the only way to keep the fees out,” he explains. “And Dwolla is the first payment network built in 30-odd years.” For those who have a hard time understanding exactly where Dwolla fits in the crowded mobile payments market where services like Square, Venmo, Google Wallet and PayPal get all the press, the difference is this: Dwolla is primarily a payments network, not a tool for enabling payments through the existing credit card network. In other words, it’s not like a Square or Google Wallet, for example, which allow you to link a credit card to your account. It is the card. Except there’s no card. In fact, if Square wanted to, it could integrate Dwolla as just another payment option into its own solution, if it wanted to. Google could as well. Or anyone. As to whether Dwolla’s ready for that, Mine says not now. “It’s too early,” he says. “We can provide more value in terms of partnerships. And everybody is on board for building a long-term play.” (Which, you know, is the best thing to say if you secretly want to be acquired, right?) We should point out that Dwolla isn’t just some outsider startup (it’s in Iowa!) going it alone. The company is backed by The Members Group, a financial services organization providing credit card processing, payment solutions, prepaid cards, consulting and more. So they sort of know what they’re doing over there. And weren’t you kind of getting sick of PayPal anyway? As for Dwolla Instant, it goes live today on the Dwolla website and will roll out to Dwolla’s mobile apps on iPhone and Android shortly thereafter. Latest headlines delivered to you daily

How Uber Is Launching In Its Newest City, Washington, DC
2011/12/15
My girlfriend: We’re late. We need to get a cab to the [Thanksgiving] dinner. Me: I just talked to the cab company and they’re going to take forever. I’m trying Uber. Her: There’s no Uber in DC. Me [checks app]: Oh, look, there is! The car will be here in 10 minutes.  And that’s how I discovered that Uber is launching in Washington, DC. Today, it’s announcing to the capital that it’s ready for business, having spent the last month recruiting drivers, testing routes and everything else that goes into opening up in a new area. I recently talked to Rachel Holt, who’s leading Uber DC, to get some more details about how the company has worked out this expansion. The first step is to figure out what the local market is looking for. DC is looking like a good target. Yes, politicians have their own taxpayer-supported livery services, but DC also has the highest concentration of people with secondary degrees. Between the better-paid government employees, contractors, law offices, lobbyists, universities, and the emerging tech scene, “there are a lot of people who want a better experience,” Holt explains. But unlike most cities (such as San Francisco), DC doesn’t artificially restrict the number of cabs, so getting them isn’t as big of a problem. However, the cars also tend to be run down, and service isn’t always great. And the thing about DC is that it’s a city of people who wear suits (also unlike SF). Uber’s black sedan-limos are providing cars to match.  DC also has some local issues that Uber can take advantage of. Cabs charge you extra for each additional stop, for example. The district is also stuck between two states and numerous counties, and many cab companies only serve some of them. If you’re downtown in the afternoon, you might have trouble getting a cab out to your home in the suburbs. Uber can ignore those constraints. The company’s local team is also busy juicing demand by doing things like event sponsorships, and outreach to local businesses. An out-of-the-way restaurant, for example, might want to tell its patrons about Uber so they can rest assured about getting home when they’re done enjoying the wine list. Of course, Uber’s real magic is software. It has also been refining how it expands to each new city. “Every minute and every day we’re collecting more and more data on where people are opening our app to figure out where biggest areas of demand are,” Holt says. That’s why we’ve needed a little runway ahead of a public launch.” Charts and heat map visualizations show how the app is being used, that the company then uses to match peak demand areas at specific times. It looks at specific pieces of data like app opens, people who get cars, and people who can’t, and the number of minutes that it takes for cars to arrive. The other factor is operations. Uber has been recruiting local people, including independent operators and small companies, to be on call for the service. It has already won many of them over, judging by the ones I’ve talked to in SF, and the one who drove us on Thanksgiving. Its pay structure is a flat fee that includes a generous tip. The software can calculate optimal coverage areas to reduce driving. And the software also cuts out dispatch operators, who sometimes play favorites with drivers at other cab companies. While Uber is a luxury service, it’s also a good example of how a software startup can break into new physical-world markets and solve long-standing problems. It forces incumbents to try to improve, and shows other startups how they can go after similar types of problems. It’s this visceral impact that helped convince Shervin Pishevar, son of an immigrant cab driver in DC, to co-lead the company’s new $32 million round of funding last week. The company is planning on expanding by two cities a month around the world. It also just launched in Paris, and is already available in San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, New York, and Boston.

StackMob’s Mobile App Platform Is Now Publicly Available
2011/12/15
StackMob, a backend service provider for mobile, is today publicly launching its mobile app platform, after having been in private beta for a good part of the year. The company, often described as a “Heroku for mobile” is a fully hosted platform that allows developers to address all the backend needs for their mobile apps including OAuth and social service integration (e.g., Twitter, Facebook), storage solutions, advertising, push notifications, analytics, API creation and more. The company closed its Series A round of $7.5 million this spring, led by Trinity Ventures with StackMob’s existing investors, Harrison Metal and Baseline Ventures, participating. With the additional funding in tow, StackMob was able to expand to a second platform beyond iOS this October, when it launched its Android SDK. But at the time, StackMob was still in private beta testing. Since its Series A, StackMob has seen 60% month-over-month grow in apps created using the platforms. Customers now include Fortune 50 hotels, banks and consumer products companies. StackMob has also signed up a top 20 mobile game which makes over 3 million API calls per day. Now available publicly, StackMob is introducing two categories of pricing, with three subcategories each. The “Starter” category, meant for smaller app makers, ranges from free to $29. Pro pricing packages, meanwhile, go from $399 to $2,999. Pro packages have access to all StackMob features, including advanced REST API creation and management, push notifications, social integration, custom code and analytics. Custom packages are also available. Interested developers can sign up for StackMob here.  Latest headlines delivered to you daily

Ski Lift Ticket Retailer Liftopia Goes Live On iPhone
2011/12/15
San Francisco-based Liftopia, an online retailer of lift tickets and mountain resort activities, is launching its iPhone app today. The app’s title is quite the mouthful: “Liftopia Ski Reports, Snow Conditions and Ultimate Lift Ticket Deal Engine App.” Whoa! So there’s the news, I guess – it’s all in the app’s name. Oh you want more info? OK. The new app, available for iPhone and iPod Touch, lets skiers and snowboarders browse and buy deals on lift tickets and other mountain activities in advance just like Liftopia’s website does. Upon launch, the app taps into your current location to instantly pull up nearby deals. You can also browse through deals in your favorite regions or search deals by date. Whe you’re ready to purchase, you can buy the tickets directly from the app itself. All your activity in the app is synced back to the Liftopia.com website, too, so if you prefer to shop online, you can just use the app to access your tickets on the go instead of having to print out and carry vouchers with you to the resort. Handy. Other features in the app include the ability to check conditions and weather reports, get directions to the lifts, store resorts as “favorites,” set up deal alerts and more. Liftopia now offers over 75,000 deals at more than 150 ski areas which are up to 80% off ticket window prices. Current partners include Aspen/Snowmass, Park City, Mount Snow, Sun Valley, Squaw Valley/Alpine Meadows and others. The startup recently raised $1.3 million in funding from First Round Capital and others, bringing its total raise to nearly $3 million. Seriously, though, what’s with the app title? App Store SEO?

VerticalResponse Buys Social Media Marketing Technology Startup Roost
2011/12/15
VerticalResponse, which provides self-service digital marketing solutions, has acquired Roost, a privately held social media marketing technology company based in San Francisco.  Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. VerticalResponse users can now sign up to create, schedule, manage and measure their social media marketing campaigns from a single dashboard across platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Janine Popick, VerticalResponse’s CEO, in a statement points out that this is the first acquisition the company has completed in more than a decade in business. In the coming months, VerticalResponse plans to integrate its email and social media marketing tools more deeply, add more features and support for more social networks, and enhance its digital marketing platform’s reporting features. Following the acquisition, Roost CEO Alex Chang will serve as Vice President, Social Platform.  Roost actually started out as a real estate search engine, raising more than $13 million over the years. They pivoted to creating social media management software for small businesses back in 2010 – looks like they made the right choice.  Latest headlines delivered to you daily

Punchfork Tells Foodies Which Recipes Are Hot Right Now
2011/12/15
You’ve seen too many recipe websites. It’s okay – so have I. But Punchfork is doing things a little differently by leveraging hardcore algorithms to curate the best recipes found on the Web based on social network chatter, in realtime. Punchfork has built a sophisticated algorithm that measures a how many times a recipe posted by its publishing partners gets shared on social networks like Twitter and Facebook and sites like StumbleUpon. The higher a recipe’s score based on Punchfork’s technology, on a scale from 1 to 100, the more it should have been talked about and shared on the Web. In essence, the website lets you find out which dishes are in vogue these days, and tells you how to prepare them yourself. The company also offers an API for developers who are interested in integrating recipes from Punchfork’s publisher partners into their own websites or apps. And of course, there’s a brand new, free app for that: check out Punchfork for iPhone and iPad here. The recipe discovery platform company was founded by Jeff Miller, also the creator of Hacker News-inspired Bitly News, with $20,000 of his own money. Punchfork is up against some venture-backed companies, including Gojee, Foodily and Yummly.  Now if you’ll excuse me, I have some chicken paninis to prepare. Latest headlines delivered to you daily

Amidst ‘Advanced’ Acquisition Talks, RadVision Extends Its Video Solutions To SMBs;
2011/12/15
Well, it’s been an interesting last few weeks (and last few years, for that matter) for Israeli-headquartered video-conferencing specialist, RadVision. Acquisition rumors are currently swirling around the company, based on Israeli newspaper Globes’ report that the company is in ‘advanced’ talks with Avaya, a business collaboration and communications company, for a sale of approximately $200 million. The official word we’ve received from RadVision spokespeople is that, of course, they do not comment on “rumors or speculation”. But our Israeli sources did say, without confirming, that an acquisition will very likely happen, even if it doesn’t end up at $200 million. As Globes points out, RadVision has been looking for a potential acquisition candidate since late 2009, when its largest client, Cisco Systems (which accounted for about one-third of its revenue), bought its Norwegian videoconferencing rival, Tandberg, for $3.3 billion. Since then, RadVision has been on the defense, looking for — but not finding — the right candidate, losing money, as further talks with HP broke down last year when the two could not agree on price. Yet, over recent weeks, RadVision’s stock has gone from sinking to soaring, up 108 percent since November 29th on acquisition rumors, and holding a market cap of about $180 million. (Of course, after hours trading was not so kind to the company, as shares tumbled 12 percent Wednesday.)  As to Avaya, it announced plans for an IPO back in June, but the public offering has been repeatedly delayed. Meanwhile, over the last year, Avaya has made a number of acquisitions of late, and with quite a few unified communications products, video conferencing among them, RadVision would be a nice pick-up — if they can be convinced it’s worth $200 million. Interestingly, amidst all this coverage and speculation, RadVision quietly announced today that it is ramping up its offerings for SMBs, rolling out a suite of video solutions that is intended to bring the company’s enterprise video solution to startups and small business for a much lower cost than traditional, full-scale solutions.  RadVision is clearly hoping that by offering high definition audio, video, and content sharing, like HD video room system capabilities with embedded multi-party conferencing, desktop conferencing with firewall traversal, and support for mobile in packaged solutions, it will be able to find a new audience for products and boost revenues. The leg-up for RadVision is that they have a robust suite of enterprise-grade conferencing products, especially for the European market, but startups like AnyMeeting are also offering web-based video conferencing and webinar services — for free.  Granted, they don’t have the same scale or number of features, but with its recent announcement that it is now offering Google Apps integration to enable web conferencing to Google users in a single sign-on solution — on top of six-way video conferencing, the ability to host meetings of up to 200 attendees with no time limits, screen sharing, app sharing, recording, and social media integration — the competition from U.S. startups is at least moving in the right direction. AnyMeeting is just one example. RadVision still has a robust suite of communication tools, and expanding to offer support to SMBs certainly helps its case, but we’ll see what happens to the price as it attempts to ink a deal with Avaya. We’ll update as we learn more. Latest headlines delivered to you daily

500 Startups-Backed 72Lux Wants To Help Turn Your Site Into An eCommerce Platform
2011/12/15
Not many startups can lay claim to being part of two recognizable accelerators at the same time, but 72Lux would be one of those exceptions. The New York City-based luxury eCommerce startup was selected as a member of 500 Startups’ third batch of companies this October and was also chosen to participate in the fourth “vintage” of NYC accelerator, First Growth Venture Networks, at about the same time. Has 72Lux found a way to be in two places at once? No, the truth is that FGVN does not promise investment in exchange for a stake in the company, as 500 Startups does (and Y Combinator, TechStars, etc.), so technically FGVN is a mentorship network and community, even though it looks and smells like an accelerator. Thus, there’s no love lost here, it’s a win-win situation, especially for 72Lux. So why the interest in this young fashion startup? Well, for starters, 72Lux has built a shopping destination of high-end fashion apparel and accessories that is specifically targeted at women, so it’s capitalizing on an active, engaged demographic in a rapidly expanding (online) market. The other factor in play is that the startup is making a serious attempt at simplifying the shopping experience, by partnering with top designers and retailers to allow users to browse and buy all in one place.  It’s a bit like Yipit for fashion shopping, or Amazon, but it’s exclusively high-end apparel, mostly for women. Sure, there are quite a few eTailers for women’s high-end fashion, but few of them offer an internally-built, universal checkout mechanism that allows users to make purchases on-site. This means that you can browse by category, designer, size, color, or any combination thereof, and once you’ve selected what you want to buy, go through a single checkout channel, even if you’re purchasing goods from a different retailers. The startup also licenses this universal checkout to provide enterprise publishers with a turnkey eCommerce solution — and a complementary revenue stream. And this leads to the startup’s big value proposition — something that hasn’t been talked about much. On the surface, 72Lux looks like a consumer destination site, but Founder and CEO Heather Marie tells us that the team’s real focus is on SaaS. The startup is now officially ready to announce that it has developed software that allows websites to offer their very own integrated eCommerce platform.  Essentially, this means that enterprise websites can now white label the startup’s universal checkout, and easily integrate eCommerce directly into their own website. Not only that, but 72Lux is offering a similar product for smaller digital publishers and bloggers, meaning that pretty much any site that reviews, blogs, or discusses products can allow users to purchase those products directly from their website. Below you’ll see a mockup the 72Lux team created for one of TechCrunch’s holiday Gift Guides to give you a sense of what this would look like. (To be clear: This is just a mock-up, TechCrunch is not selling any products.)  Obviously, this is a bit similar in nature to buttons that PayPal offers to their small business clients (like the “Donate” button), except without the painful controls and problems associated with doing business with PayPal. Now bloggers and content producers can begin monetizing their content directly, partnering with the designers and retailers that offer those products, taking a cut — or not. 72Lux has started with fashion, so in this scope, smaller fashion outlets, blogs, publications, and more can easily integrate an eCommerce solution into their sites to begin selling directly to customers. Traditionally, it’s been easier for eCommerce companies to become content providers than it has for content producers to become agents of eCommerce, and Marie says that the latter is exactly what she wants 72Lux to enable. With a universal checkout, normalized product catalogs, and a suite of embeddable tools, the startup is hoping that it can convince enterprises (and smaller publishers) that working with them and their retail partners to offer an integrated solution will be easier than going it alone. The intent has been to build a one-stop luxury eCommerce solution, and now it’s to spread its white label solution across blogs and publisher sites with embeddable tools and checkout features, just as Facebook Connect brought the social network to the far reaches of the Web. Well, that’s a bit of a reach, but you know where I’m going. There are quite a few analogues. And to aid it in its SaaSy quest, the startup has raised an advisory investment round from 500 Startups as well as Thomas Varghese and several angel investors through AngelList. And obviously it also helps to be part of 500 Startups accelerator as well as First Growth Venture’s network.  Marie said that the company has also struck deals with a few big enterprise partners, but could not say more than that. So no doubt we’ll be hearing some more news from 72Lux over the next few months. Stay tuned. For more, check out 72Lux at home here. Latest headlines delivered to you daily

A Look At The Organizations That Grabbed $115 Million In Grants From Google In 2011
2011/12/14
As you may have heard, Google is getting into the holiday giving spirit these days, as it late last night announced that it has dished out an additional $40 million in philanthropic grants, targeted at science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), girls’ education, and even fighting slavery. (You can read more in Google.org SVP Shona Brown’s blog post here.)  These grants brought the total that Google has funneled into nonprofit and academic institutions over the course of the year to $115 million — and that’s on top of the $1 billion the company invests in programs like Google Grants, Google Apps for Education, which offer free support and services to non-profits and educational institutions. As part of the $115 million in philanthropic grants awarded over this year, Google has funded 16 programs in STEM and “girls’ education” (nine of which are in the U.S.) for a total of $14.7 million. These programs include the Tech Museum of Innovation, the D.C. Public Education Fund, Girl Scouts of Northern California, the Computer History Museum, Boston-based Citizen Schools, and U.K.-based Generating Genius. The rest include: In support of girls’ education, Google also dished out funding to the African Leadership Academy, which “provides merit scholarships to promising young women”, as well as across the continent, and the Afghan Institute of Learning, which brings literacy to the young women of rural Afghanistan. Others include: Google also awarded 14 grants to recognize “the entrepreneurial spirit” behind companies using the Web, open source programming, and other tech platforms to improve access to information — something Google has obviously long been passionate about. These include companies like Vittana, which offers loans to students with great credit history in the developing world, Code For America, which received a grant of $1.5 million in an attempt to help governments become more transparent, connected, and efficient by connecting web developers to leaders in civic services. DoSomething.org also received $2 million in funding to help connect mobile and wired teens with causes they care about, as well as Switchboard, a company that helps African health care works connect with local mobile providers to create free networks and communications channels. The other 10 organizations include: The last portion, $11.5 million, was apportioned to organizations that will help free people from modern-day slavery, which you can read about here.  There are some amazing companies in this list of grant recipients, and Google has clearly spent more than a little time researching some of the more inspiring and big-picture-minded non-profits and technology companies operating out there today. Sure, this is just the season when Google spends some time promoting its charitable grants, but if you have a few minutes, it’s worth checking these organizations out. There’s a lot of value here.

Gumroad Lets You Sell Anything You Make
2011/12/14
The guy who helped bring you Crate, a dead simple file-sharing service, are now testing something called Gumroad, a way to ask folks to pay for downloads. The site is very basic – you enter a URL, a price, and share the link. Users are asked for a credit card number (don’t buy that, it’s just this) to buy the item and sellers pay 5% plus 30 cents for each sale.  The system is aimed at ad hoc sales and the seller protections are nearly non-existent. The download link isn’t  obfuscated. Instead it’s hidden until Gumroad shows it to you after your purchase. There is nothing stopping folks from, say, sharing the download link later with friends and family. However, like Louis CK’s experiment, this site assumes humans are good, kind, and honest – a fatal assumption in many cases.   There are plenty of ways to deliver content. This is simply the next step in the equation – monetizing said content to everyone’s benefit. I could see Dropbox, for example, adding a “Pay Me For This” link and making a lot of money in the process, but I suspect they don’t want to sully the overall file sharing experience with financial transactions.  Gumroad makes sense. There are plenty of things I’d love to sell if I had the option – early access to podcasts, naked photos of myself, etc. – if I only had the means to do it quickly and easily. By making sales as simple as clicking one button, Gumroad opens up a vista of opportunity in the world of simple micropayments. Latest headlines delivered to you daily

Zazzle Launches AR Technology To Let You See How Art Looks On Your Wall Before You Buy
2011/12/14
It’s been a while since we’ve written about DIY online shop, Zazzle. But the company has grown to be one of the largest customization companies out there, with 20 million unique visitors a month. And today the company is pressing forward with developing its own innovative new ways to help users more accurately customize and visualize their products.  For eShopping, one of the next big technology trends will see augmented reality and artificial intelligence allowing customers to try on clothes without actually being in-store, test products, and so on before buying them.  As to its own play into this world, Zazzle is today announcing AR technology that will show online shoppers exactly what art, prints, canvass wraps, photos, etc. will look like on their office or home walls. Online art buyers — both high end and not — are generally lacking in ways to accurately visualize art on their walls, which is something that we’d all like to do, especially before committing a sizable chunk of our income to a specific piece.  Using its so-called “Zazzle Realview” technology, shoppers can easily snap a picture and upload it to the site, then interact with 3D-rendered photos to see (in realtime) how the prints will appear on their very own walls. Users can upload personal graphics or photos, or choose from thousands online — and as they make changes to size and frame type, for example, those changes are instantly reflected in Realview’s visualizations. What’s cool about this is that Realview works for all art, personal or stock art on Zazzle, regardless of price, allowing you to check it out via AR. Of course, Zazzle is not alone here. Art.com, Panasonic, and even Lego have comparable AR services, but Zazzle thinks that by offering features like automatic calibration of user placement, simulated lighting over products, interactive view of a 3D model with a webcam, as well as high-res views of customizable products within a user environment, they’ve got a leg up on the competition. It’s pretty cool: The company’s patent-pending computational photography tech combines computer graphics, object recognition, image processing and digital photography to produce interactive assets. While most other AR in this space are processing video data at around 1 to 1.5 megapixels, Realview ups that to between 5 and 6 megapixels, which Zazzle hopes will put it in the “glossy” web magazine space.  It seems like a niche space, but Zazzle is currently processing billions of dollars in customize products each year, and sees millions of art buyers and visitors each month — which brings some neat technology to a fairly wide audience and to a space that traditionally suffers from legacy models.

Overwolf Partners With TeamSpeak To Give Online Games A Social Boost (And In-Game Voice Chat)
2011/12/14
A slice of good news for gamers: Today, TeamSpeak, a company which makes voice communications systems to let gamers chat while playing games, has partnered with Overwolf to begin offering gamers some serious suped-up social and voice communications functionality during gameplay. TeamSpeak users can install a simple widget to get in-game notifications, chat, the ability to change voice settings, and manage channels without leaving the comfort of their favorite MMO games.  For those unfamiliar with Overwolf, the Israeli startup that makes software to overlay social media in games, the company’s mission is, put simply, to “Zynga-fy online games” (in a good way), providing a software client that seamlessly adds a social layer to games, providing us with a convenient way to share achievements, access Facebook, Twitter, Skype, MSN, web browsers, and gameplay recording while playing multiplayer online games. Obviously, neither company is without competition in the gaming world, especially Overwolf, as the ‘socialization of everything’ has certainly come to games in full force, but for game publishers, Overwolf provides an easy way to integrate social media within games to boost virality and reduce user acquisition costs without touching a line of code. Overwolf has partnered with companies like Frogster Online Gaming, Games-Masters, gPotato and Aeria Games, which have launched their own branded versions of the service as a way to connect their online games with various social platforms. It’s a great way for gamers to interact with other members, post screenshots or videos, search databases for new tricks, cheats, and explanations while playing games, and Overwolf is hoping that by providing a channel into already-existing social networks they can bypass having to create their own gaming social network from scratch. TeamSpeak, too, has been looking for easier ways to boost their in-game support, so with their new partnership with Overwolf, both are able to offer a deep set of communications tools that players already had on the desktop during the online, in-game experience. Overwolf CEO Uri Marchand said that gamers and Overwolf users have been champing at the bit to get TeamSpeak support, as TeamSpeak has become very popular among online gamers, which use the service to strategize and speak to other team members while playing, including realtime voice chat, file sharing, and so on. While many game development companies have been trying to enhance user experience by offering more social tools, Twitter and Facebook integration, YouTube support and so on (as we wrote of Trion in April), this partnership between TeamSpeak and Overwolf could be of great value to smaller development operations that don’t have the time or resources to build social and communications functionality from scratch.

GrubWithUs Now Wants To Plan YOUR Group Meals (And Do All The Legwork)
2011/12/14
You’re hungry. You’re feeling social. But you’re also feeling laaaaazy, and planning a big group meal can be so much work that you end up hating everyone at the table by the end of it. GrubWithUs, a startup best known for organizing buy-in dinners with overarching themes (TechCrunch fans!) or at least one particularly interesting person at the table, is playing with the idea of building dinners for the most interesting person of all: you. You punch in a few details, and GrubWithUs does pretty much all of the leg work — but there’s a catch! The new service (which just went live in Chicago first, with a national rollout planned) is aptly dubbed “Create-A-Meal”. You start out by telling it which city you’re looking to grub in, how many grubbers there will be, how much dough the group is willing to cough up per head, and GrubWithUs takes it from there. They find a restaurant, negotiate a menu, and send out the invites. They’ll even handle the check-splitting (read: the part that makes you hate your friends) beforehand. The catch: Much like Priceline or Hotwire’s hotel search, you don’t know what the restaurant will be until the deal is sealed. GrubWithUs says they’re “committed to only working with the top restaurants in the city”, though, so you probably don’t have to worry that your mystery meal will end up being Taco Bell’s $10 Grande Box. GrubWithUs says they’ll gladly work around dietary restrictions — so if you’ve got a friend who only eats cardboard, toast, and fish killed on Fridays, be sure to let them know. Until now, there was no way for anyone outside of GrubWithUs to build meals. Any meals listed on the site were organized by their sales team in coordination with local restaurants. Meals are private by default, though you can open them up to the public (and listed on GrubWithUs) if you’re looking to break bread with some new pals. You can find the new Create-Your-Own page here. Note that while the page seems to load regardless of what city you’re in, the company says the feature is Chicago-only for the time being. Latest headlines delivered to you daily

Flipboard Adds 1 Million Users Its First Week On The iPhone
2011/12/14
Only one week after Flipboard’s highly anticipated launch on the iPhone (and iPod Touch), the company is announcing it has added 1 million users to its service and has tripled its engagement. According to the company, that means it now has over 5 million users in total using the app across the iOS platform. Before last week’s release, Flipboard had registered 650 million flips per month on the iPad. Now it’s trending towards 2 billion flips per month. “Flips,” for those who don’t get the Flipboard lingo, refers to swiping within the app in order to turn the page. The magazine-like experience provided by Flipboard has long been one of the most popular iPad applications, having previously been named Apple’s iPad App of the Year for 2010 and Time Magazine’s Top 50 Inventions. In fact, the iPhone launch was so hot, that Flipboard actually went down for hours. New in the iPhone version is a feature called “Cover Stories,” which is based on the relevance-matching technology Flipboard acquired with Ellerdale in 2010. This uses reader interactions like tweets, retweets and likes alongside manual curation to surface a personalized set of top stories. Despite its many accolades, not everyone loves the Flipboard way of reading. Our own John Biggs notoriously gave the app a “Die” in “Fly or Die,” but he might just be in the minority.

It’s a free service you can use to create personal christmas cards.  Latest headlines delivered to you daily

Credit Sesame Brings Your Credit Score To The iPhone. For Free.
2011/12/14
Personal finance service (and TechCrunch Disrupt alum) Credit Sesame is launching its first mobile application today which gives users instant access to their current financial standing and their credit score. For free. And I don’t mean “free” as in free, but if you don’t read the fine print we’ll sign you up for our monthly service.  I mean free as in free. For those of you unfamiliar with Credit Sesame, the young startup helps users better understand their personal finances. But unlike Mint, which looks at a person’s bank accounts, investments, budget, goals and loans, Credit Sesame is primarily focused on credit and loans. Using the same technology as banks, the company is able to analyze a user’s complete debt situation and then recommend various loan and credit options that can save them money . However, Credit Sesame isn’t paid for lead generation, so it doesn’t just hand over customers’ information to banks and lenders in order to generate revenue. Instead, it only receives payment when a customer signs up for one of its recommendations.  With the new mobile application, customers will be able to do much of what you could previously do only via the website, including sign up for an account, access your financial information, check your credit score, view your available credit and debt payments and more. It’s important to note that when you check your credit score via the app, it doesn’t ding your credit, as it would when a company runs a credit check for you to determine whether you qualify for a new credit card, store card or loan, for example. The score comes from Experian. For now, consumers can use this information to get a general idea as to their financial health, but in the future, Credit Sesame will provide more specific guidance. (“Can I get a Macy’s card?”, “Can I buy this car?” are some example that come to mind). Credit Sesame secures your information using bank-grade security approved by VeriSign and McAfee, protects mobile users’ data behind a PIN and enables you to switch off mobile access if your phone is lost or stolen. In addition, although the service requires your Social Security Number upon sign-up, this information is not stored on the phone. According to founder Adrian Nazari, the startup helps two out of three people find “substantial” savings, even if not everyone chooses to act on its recommendations. He won’t disclose the size of the user base yet, but hints that it’s now in the six digits. The company raised $6.15 million from Menlo Ventures this March, and has been growing steadily since. The mobile app is first available for the iPhone, but an Android app will follow shortly. You can download the new app from here on iTunes. Latest headlines delivered to you daily
