We Will Rock You (musical)

We Will Rock You (often abbreviated as WWRY) was a musical based on the songs of Queen with a book by Ben Elton. The musical tells the story of a group of Bohemians who struggle to restore the free exchange of thought, fashion, and live music in a distant future where everyone dresses, thinks and does the same. Musical instruments and composers are forbidden, and rock music is all but unknown.
Directed by Christopher Renshaw and choreographed by Arlene Phillips, the original West End production opened at the Dominion Theatre on 14 May 2002, with Tony Vincent, Hannah Jane Fox, Sharon D. Clarke and Kerry Ellis in principal roles. Although the musical was at first panned by critics, it has become an audience favourite, becoming the longest-running musical at the Dominion Theatre, celebrating its tenth anniversary on 14 May 2012. The London production closed on 31 May 2014 after a final performance in which Brian May and Roger Taylor both performed.
A number of international productions have since followed the original, and "We Will Rock You" has been seen in five of the world's continents. Many productions are still active globally.
Development.
According to Brian May, Queen's manager Jim Beach had spoken with the band about creating a jukebox musical with Queen's songs since the mid-1990s. Initially, the intent was to create a biographical story of Freddie Mercury. About this time, Robert De Niro's production company Tribeca expressed interest in a Queen musical, but it found the original idea difficult to work with.
In 2000, Ben Elton was approached to start talks with May and Taylor on the project. He suggested taking the musical down a different path than initially imagined, creating an original story that would capture the spirit of much of their music. He worked closely with May and Taylor to incorporate Queen's songs into the story. Elton has also stated that he was in part inspired by the computer-controlled dystopia of the science-fiction film "The Matrix". The script was eventually completed midway through 2001. Before working on "We Will Rock You", neither May nor Taylor liked the musical genre.
The original London production began previews on 26 April 2002 and opened on 14 May 2002 at the Dominion Theatre. The show is still running at this venue. On 14 May 2013 celebrated its 11th anniversary.
Critical reception.
London's critics almost uniformly panned the show, criticising the concept and direction. "The Guardian" wrote that the premise "really is as sixth form as it sounds", called the production "ruthlessly packaged and manufactured" and opined that the "sometimes funny" libretto exists mainly to "devise more unlikely ways to wring out another Queen song." The "Daily Mirror" wrote that "Ben Elton should be shot for this risible story." However, some individual performances received praise and the production remains a popular success. In their popular book "Is It Just Me Or Is Everything Shit", Steve Lowe and Alan MacArthur derided the show as having "a plot similar to a "Yes" concept album".
Productions.
West End and UK tour.
The original production of "We Will Rock You" opened on 12 May 2002 at the Dominion Theatre in London, England. Tony Vincent played the lead role of Galileo, with Hannah Jane Fox as Scaramouche, Sharon D. Clarke as Killer Queen, Nigel Planer as Pop, Nigel Clauzel as Brit and Kerry Ellis as Meat. For her performance, Clarke was nominated for "Best Performance in a Supporting Role in a Musical or Entertainment" at the 2003 Olivier Awards.
On 17 August 2005 "We Will Rock You" became the longest running musical at that venue, surpassing the previous record-holder "Grease". This is a notable achievement because the Dominion Theatre is one of the largest theatrical venues in West End, with a seating a capacity of 2,163 patrons. The show recently closed at the theatre, on 31 May 2014. At the 2011 Laurence Olivier Awards, the show won the Audience Award for Most Popular Show.
Notable cast replacements include Mig Ayesa, who played Galileo, taking over from Tony Vincent. Mazz Murray took over the role of Killer Queen after Sharon D. Clarke's departure in April 2004. Murray left the production in August 2011, which made her the longest running principal cast member, although she left the production briefly in September 2010 for maternity leave. Brenda Edwards, who was an X Factor semi-finalist in 2005, is currently performing the role of Killer Queen. On 22 September 2008 "I'd Do Anything" semi-finalist, Rachel Tucker, began performing in the role of Meat. She left the production on 19 September 2009. The role was then taken on by Irish born performer Louise Bowden, who had already performed in several prolific musicals including Mama Mia, Guys and Dolls and Mary Poppins. Bowden unexpectedly quit the production in May 2010. It was then left to Amanda Coutts to perform the role Meat. Coutts was originally Bowden's understudy. The West End production features a nine piece live band under the musical direction of Stuart Morley. Show timings are Monday - Friday 7.30pm with a 2.30pm matinee performances on Saturdays. An extra matinee showing takes place on the last Wednesday of each month, also at 2.30pm.
A national UK tour was launched in 2009 at the Palace Theatre, Manchester. The 2009 tour cast initially included, Alex Gaumond as Galileo, Sarah French-Ellis as Scaramouche, Brenda Edwards as Killer Queen, Georgina Hagen as Meat, Jonathan Wilkes as Khashoggi, Kevin Kennedy as Pop. Gaumond and French-Ellis returned to play their characters in the West End and were Galileo and Scaramouche.
A second UK tour launched in December 2010 at the Palace Theatre, Manchester.
On 11 March 2014 it was announced the West End production will close on 31 May 2014, shortly after its 12th Anniversary, and after 4600 performances at the Dominion Theatre.
Australia and Japan.
The first international production premiered at the Regent Theatre in Melbourne, Australia on 7 August 2003. The cast included Michael Falzon as Galileo, Kate Hoolihan as Scaramouche and Annie Crummer as Killer Queen. Amanda Harrison, who originated Oz in this Melbourne production, had previously been in the ensemble of the original London production. The production closed at this venue on 4 March 2004 to make way for Australian tour stops at Burswood Theatre, Perth (27 April to June 2004), Queensland Performing Arts Centre, Brisbane (27 July to 25 September 2004), and Star City Lyric Theatre, Sydney (9 October 2004 to 13 March 2005). The same production then made an international tour stop at the Shinjuku Koma Theater in Tokyo, Japan where it ran from 27 May to 24 August 2005.
Due to the success of the Japan tour stop, another Australian tour group was put together in 2006. They performed at the same venue: the Shinjuku Koma Theatre in Tokyo, from 14 November to 17 December 2006. Some of the actors of the 2005 tour returned for the 2006 tour, including Peter Murphy as Galileo, Daniel Fletcher as Brit, Ross Givern as Khashoggi and Robert Grubb as Pop. Kate Hoolihan, who had played Scaramouche in the 2005 tour, chose to switch to the role of Oz in the 2006 tour. The tour group then performed in Osaka from 5 January 2007 at the Umeda Arts Theater.
Spain.
A Spanish production ran from 3 November 2003 to 30 May 2004 at Teatro Calderón, Madrid. The lead role of Galileo was shared by José Luis Cortés and Miguel Fernández. The rest of the cast included María Blanco as Scaramouche, Sheilah Cuffey as Killer Queen and Eva María Cortés (sister of José Luis Cortés) as Meat. The Madrid production had all spoken dialogue and the lyrics translated into Spanish, except for the songs "We Will Rock You", "We Are the Champions" and "Bohemian Rhapsody", which retained their English lyrics. After closing at Teatro Calderón, the show began a tour through Spain with stops at Barcelona (12 November to 12 December 2004), Bilbao (17 December 2004 to 16 January 2005) and Valencia (3 to 27 February 2005).
In 2007 the production returned to Calderón Theatre, Madrid with previews from 23 January and an official opening on 12 February. This stage featured an entirely new cast, with Daniel Diges and Julian Fontalvo sharing the role of Galileo, Ruth Calvo and Elena Medina sharing the role of Scaramouche, Maria Lopez and Lara Alcazar sharing the role of Meat, as well as Nieves Val and Tessa sharing the role of Killer Queen. The production finally closed on 6 January 2008.
Las Vegas, North America.
A US tour had originally been planned for 2004, with initially announced stops in Connecticut and Washington state. However, due to scheduling conflicts of the creative team, the US tour was scrapped and replaced with a production housed at the Paris Las Vegas hotel and casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, which is the musical's first North American venue.
The Las Vegas production had previews from 4 August and officially opened on 8 September 2004. Tony Vincent, who had originated the role of Galileo in the London production, reprised the role, which he alternated with Jason Wooten. Aspen Miller and Kacie Sheik shared the role of Scaramouche, Patti Russo was Killer Queen, and Ty Taylor was Brit. The Las Vegas production "trimmed" down the book into a single act show. This production closed on 27 November 2005. Vincent and Miller would end up getting married in 2008.
On 15 October 2013, a North American tour began at the Hippodrome Theatre in Baltimore, Maryland. The original cast includes Brian Justin Crum as Galileo, PJ Griffith as Kashoggi, Jacqueline Arnold as Killer Queen, Jared Zirilli as Britney, Ruby Lewis as Scaramouche, Ryan Knowles as Pop and Erica Peck as Oz.
Russia.
A Russian production opened in the Estrada Theatre, Moscow on 17 October 2004. The production's dialogue and all songs but three were translated into Russian, by Evgeny Margulis of Mashina Vremeni. This production closed only four months after its opening due to disagreements between the show's producers, despite fan protests to keep the show going.
Germany.
A German production opened in the Musical Dome, Cologne on 12 December 2004. The Cologne production had the spoken dialogue translated to German, but the musical numbers consisted of a mix of translated German language lyrics and the original English language lyrics. According to Brian May, the language combination was intentional by writer Ben Elton, with German representing the show's "present day" and English representing the distant past. The production closed at this venue on 30 September 2008 to be transferred to Stuttgart. The Stuttgart transfer opened at the Apollo Theatre on 13 November 2008 after previews from 7 November 2008.
The production opened in Berlin on 21 October 2010 and closed for good on 21 October 2011.
A follow up tour version started in December 2012 in Basel and closed in June 2013 in Essen. It is going to restart in September 2014 in Munich followed by Frankfurt and Vienna.
South Africa.
A South African production opened at the Civic Theatre in Johannesburg on 9 May 2006. The production starred Francois Schreuder as Galileo, Helen Burger as Scaramouche, Vicky Sampson as Killer Queen, and Helen Goldberg as Oz. This production made tour stops at the Artscape in Cape Town (from 25 July) and the Playhouse Opera in Durban (29 September to 29 October 2006) before closing.
Switzerland and Austria.
A German-language production opened in Zürich, Switzerland on 3 December 2006 at Theatre Stadthof 11, Oerlikon using the book of the bilingual Cologne production. The Swiss production starred Jessica Kessler as Scaramouche, Brigitte Oelke as Killer Queen and Rachel Fischer as Ozzy. This production closed at the end of 2007 to be transferred to Vienna. The transfer opened in Vienna, Austria on 24 January 2008, at the Raimund Theatre where it ran until 13 July 2008.
Canada.
A Canadian production began previews on 14 March and officially opened on 10 April 2007 at the Canon Theatre, Toronto. Mig Ayesa, who played the lead role in the London production, had been offered the role in the Canadian production by Brian May and Ben Elton, but the Canadian producers wanted an all-Canadian cast and Quebec native Yvan Pednault was given the role. The rest of the cast included Erica Peck as Scaramouche, Alana Bridgewater as Killer Queen, Suzie McNeil as Oz and Evan Buliung as Khashoggi. McNeil had been a participant of the reality show "", in which she had competed against Ayesa and former Las Vegas "We Will Rock You" cast member Ty Taylor.
This production closed at the Canon Theatre on 11 May 2008 to be transferred to the Panasonic Theatre, where it opened on 16 July 2008. The new Toronto production underwent major rewrites in order to trim the show before its reopening. Changes include: there is no longer any dialogue between "Ga-Ga" and "I Want to Break Free"; "One Vision" has been cut; the Act Two song sequence is now "Fat Bottomed Girls", "Who Wants to Live Forever", "Seven Seas of Rhye", "Hammer to Fall" and then "Another One Bites the Dust" before leading to the finale. In October 2008, Camilla Scott took over the role of Khashoggi, a character that had previously been portrayed as a male, though her understudies remain male. Erica Peck, who originated the role of Scaramouche in this production, was scheduled to reprise her role from 29 May to the closing date. This production closed on 28 June 2009.
Australasian tour.
An Australasian tour was launched on at the end of 2007 in New Zealand, in which previous "We Will Rock You" cast members MiG Ayesa (London cast), Annie Crummer (original Australian cast), Neels Clasen (original South African cast) and Malcolm Terry (original South African cast) reprise their roles as Galileo, Killer Queen, Khashoggi and Pop respectively. Talia Kodesh, who had played Oz in the South African production, played the role of Scaramouche in the New Zealand tour stop. After the tour left New Zealand, the role was taken over by Sivan Raphaely, who had been in the ensemble of the original South African production.
The tour performed in Auckland, New Zealand at The Civic, The Edge (26 October to 2 December 2007), in Seoul, South Korea at the Seongnam Arts Centre (2 to 24 February 2008), in Singapore at the Esplanade Theatre (28 March to 27 April 2008), in Hong Kong at The Lyric Theatre of The Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts (16 May to 22 June 2008) and in Bangkok, Thailand at the Muangthai Ratchadalai Theatre (12 to 27 July 2008).

But there was a small change in the cast: 
<br>
Cast

Summary: Original London production.
Act One.
The story is set exactly 300 years in the future in a vaguely Orwellian world. Earth has been renamed as the "iPlanet" (Planet Mall in older productions) and is controlled by the Globalsoft Corporation. ("Innuendo") On the iPlanet, mainstream commercial conformity reigns, in which Ga Ga Kids watch the same movies, listen to computer-generated music, wear the same clothes and hold the same thoughts and opinions. Musical instruments are forbidden, and rock music is unknown. ("Radio Ga Ga")
In the newest graduating class is black sheep Galileo, who has dreams and hears strange words in his head, most of which are lyrics of songs long since lost, though he does not understand their significance. Despite his teacher's advice, Galileo refuses to conform like the rest of his classmates. ("I Want to Break Free") Galileo is captured by Khashoggi, commander of Globalsoft's police. The teacher also reveals a second anomaly, a young goth woman who is openly mocked and derided by her peers ("Somebody to Love"). She too is arrested by Khashoggi.
Ruling Globalsoft Corporation is the Killer Queen. ("Killer Queen") She has heard of a prophecy that instruments have been hidden somewhere on the iPlanet in the "place of living rock", and a "bright star" will show the way to them. She orders Khashoggi to get to the bottom of the matter and crush the rebel Bohemians who believe in the prophecy. Killer Queen then basks in her power over the iPlanet. ("Play the Game")
Galileo and the young woman wake up in a hospital ("Death on Two Legs" (intro)). They realise that they are kindred spirits, feared by the rest of their society. ("Under Pressure") They flee together from the hospital.
Killer Queen has blown up all the rocks on the iPlanet, but cannot find any supposed hidden instruments. She insists that they have won, and the prophecy will not come to pass. ("A Kind of Magic")
On the streets, Bohemians Brit and Meat climb out of the sewers, where they have been gathering materials to make musical instruments. Brit is a believer in the Dreamer who will fulfil the prophecy, and insists to the cynical Meat that it's the key to bringing real music back into the world. ("I Want It All") Brit and Meat hear footsteps approaching, and hide.
Galileo and the woman arrive, with Galileo talking about his belief that he has a destiny. He says that he has a name for the woman: "Scaramouche". Brit and Meat reveal themselves, and accuse Galileo and Scaramouche of being spies, because Galileo keeps spouting words of the "sacred text". Galileo insists that he only hears those words in his head. Brit tests Galileo, singing the first few lines of "Bohemian Rhapsody". Galileo responds correctly with the subsequent lines, and Brit realises that he is the Dreamer of the prophecy. They bring Galileo and Scaramouche to the Heartbreak Hotel, which is located at the ruins of the Tottenham Court Road tube station, where the Bohemians have made their home. ("Headlong") Of note, the original London production is staged at the Dominion Theatre, which is located above the real Tottenham Court Road tube station.
The Bohemians explain that they take their names after singers long gone, and mourn the deaths of those who died young. ("No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)") The group then celebrate the reason rock bands started playing music in the first place, which was for love. ("Crazy Little Thing Called Love")
Khashoggi and his police suddenly arrive at the Heartbreak Hotel, where they round up the Bohemians for capture. Brit breaks free and battles the police in order to enable Galileo and Scaramouche to escape, but in the process is killed. ("Ogre Battle")
Act Two.
The Ga Ga Kids of the iPlanet move on in their regular fashion. ("One Vision")
Galileo and Scaramouche have escaped the Heartbreak Hotel, and realise that back at the hospital, tracking devices were installed in their heads. They remove them, and upon realising that they are all that's left of the rebels, they confess their love for each other. ("Who Wants to Live Forever")
The surviving Bohemians have been rounded up by Khashoggi to be tortured. ("Flash") When he cannot get any information from them about the prophecy, he has them brain-drained. ("Seven Seas of Rhye"—interpolating "Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon")
Galileo wakes up, and tells Scaramouche that he had a dream that the Bohemians were sent to the Seven Seas of Rhye. Scaramouche agrees they have to go there, but then Galileo insists that she stay because she's a "chick", to which Scaramouche takes offence. They argue, and decide that both of them will go to the Seven Seas of Rhye, but their relationship will be purely professional.
Back at Globalsoft headquarters ("Fat Bottomed Girls") Khashoggi reports that the Bohemians are no longer a problem. Killer Queen prematurely starts to celebrate. ("Don't Stop Me Now") Khashoggi interrupts her, explaining that Galileo and Scaramouche escaped. Killer Queen declares this is the last time Khashoggi has disappointed her, and has him brain-drained. ("Another One Bites the Dust")
Galileo and Scaramouche are making their way to the Seven Seas of Rhye, arguing all the way. ("Hammer to Fall") At the Seven Seas of Rhye pub in Montreaux, Pop the librarian is serving drinks to the lifeless Bohemians. ("These Are the Days of Our Lives") When Galileo and Scaramouche arrive, Pop explains the full nature of the prophecy to them as inscribed by the three remaining members of the band Queen just before they were sentenced to death (Brian May, his last request being a final guitar solo, apparently delayed his execution for three and a half days). Scaramouche figures out that the bright shining star of the prophecy is rock star Freddie Mercury's statue, and that it's pointing to Wembley Stadium, the "place of living rock". After initially preparing to travel by bicycle, (opening of "Bicycle Race") Scaramouche protests that the method "isn't very cool", and so they travel there by motorcycle. ("Headlong (reprise)")
Wembley Stadium is in ruins, with no instruments to be found. Reconciling and their love for each other rekindled ("Love of My Life"), Scaramouche inspires Galileo to perform the opening of "We Will Rock You", and an electric guitar is revealed. Galileo cannot play it, but Scaramouche can. ("Brighton Rock solo") Pop hacks into Globalsoft's network so their music can be heard by everyone on the iPlanet, and Killer Queen is defeated. ("Tie Your Mother Down", "We Will Rock You / We Are the Champions")
After the curtain calls ("We Will Rock You (fast version)"), a question appears that says "Do you want "Bohemian Rhapsody"?" Everybody in the audience is supposed to shout yes, and the answer appears as "Oh...alright then" and the entire cast perform "Bohemian Rhapsody" as an encore.
Variations.
International productions of the musical feature changes in the story and song line-up in order to better reach target audiences. All the main characters retain their general personalities across productions, but the names vary depending on the production. (See characters section below).
The dialogue contains many references to popular culture, with lyrics from numerous non-Queen songs and albums inserted into the text. These references are constantly changing, and according to writer Elton, this is to keep the show "fresh". Songs that have been referenced include The Beatles' "Help!", "Strawberry Fields Forever", "Penny Lane", "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", "I Am the Walrus" and "Hello, Goodbye", Little Richard's "Tutti Fruitti" and "Long Tall Sally", the theme from The Wombles, The Goodies' "Funky Gibbon", Bruce Springsteen's "Born to Run", David Bowie's "Rebel Rebel" and "Space Oddity", The Wild Ones' "Wild Thing", Rolling Stones' "Honky Tonk Women", Bob Dylan's "Mr. Tambourine Man", ABBA's "Dancing Queen" and "Fernando", Oasis' "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?", Eminem's "The Real Slim Shady", Spice Girls' "Wannabe", Elton John's "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road", Black Lace's "Agadoo", The Clash's "Complete Control", "Teletubbies" and songs by Amy Winehouse and Michael Jackson.
May often performs with the London production on special occasions such as anniversaries and Freddie Mercury's birthday.
Hannah Jane Fox, who originated Scaramouche, was the last original principal cast member to remain with the show. She gave her final performance on 28 January 2006, four years after the musical opened at the Dominion Theatre, and the event was celebrated with May appearing on stage to perform the guitar solo during the "Bohemian Rhapsody" encore.
On 5 September 2006, the London show celebrated what would have been Freddie Mercury's 60th birthday. During the song "Don't Stop Me Now", ordinarily sung by Killer Queen, the band "McFly" (who were at No. 1 with the song on the singles charts the previous week) emerged onto the stage to sing it instead. Brian May and Roger Taylor joined the encore, performing Taylor's "Say It's Not True" as a duo. Ben Elton also addressed the audience on this special occasion. The following week, tickets to the London show were sold from £19.46, Mercury's birth year.
On 14 May 2007, the London show celebrated its fifth anniversary with a special show featuring both May and Taylor playing in the final section of the show. Writer Ben Elton also made an appearance to present a special plaque to the cast, May and Taylor. During the portion of the show based in Pop's bar, the line "But the Pub Landlord has a Bike" was followed by a cameo appearance of British comedian Al Murray, who came up through the stage on a motorcycle.
The London show's sixth anniversary performance was held on 21 May 2008, a week after its actual anniversary due to the unavailability of Brian May. For the first time since the show opened, the Killer Queen character performed the entire song "Don't Stop Me Now", a musical number which is normally interrupted by the Khashoggi character. This unique performance is acknowledged by Killer Queen's dialogue: "No, you didn't let me finish, you never let me finish. For six long years, night after night, week after week, year after year. Well, tonight, I'm going to finish." To which Khashoggi replied: "It's not in the script!" The Killer Queen proceeded to yell "Screw the script!" before continuing the song. Additionally, May joined Killer Queen and the dancers on stage for the performance. After the encore, Elton made a thank you speech, after which the entire cast performed "The Show Must Go On", accompanied by May on guitar.
The seventh anniversary of the London Show was celebrated on Monday 18 May 2009. The show contained a special appearance from Brian May and Ben Elton who emerged together in a cloud of smoke during the encore rendition of "Bohemian Rhapsody" with May playing guitar. As with the year before, Elton gave a thank you speech and the entire cast performed "The Show Must Go On", accompanied by May on guitar.
On Saturday 12 September 2009 at the early matinee performance Brian May again emerged in a cloud of smoke playing the guitar in "Bohemian Rhapsody". What was the occasion for this appearance is not clear. He did the same again on Saturday 14 November 2009 at the matinee.
On Sunday 31 January 2010 in The O2 Dublin, Brian May once again played Bohemian Rhapsody with the company during the finale of both the matinee and evening shows to celebrate the end of their year long tour.
On Saturday 5 September 2010 Brian also appeared though a cloud of smoke, again to play "Bohemian Rhapsody". This was due to the annual cast change, as well as a celebration of what would have been Freddie Mercury's 64th birthday, and afterwards Brian gave a farewell speech to the cast that were leaving.
On Saturday 5 October 2013, Brian appeared through the cloud of smoke to play Bohemian Rhapsody once more. This was because it was cast change and some of the cast were leaving. Brian appeared to be very emotional when he was giving his speech.
Shows with Queen.
Queen guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor often perform at premieres and special events. Bassist John Deacon left Queen in 1997, and hasn't performed with May or Taylor since.
When Bohemian Rhapsody is performed with Brian and Roger, Brian comes up from a trap in the stage with a lot of smoke (only at Dominion Theatre. Elsewhere he is walking from the Wembley gate in the back, to the front of stage.) He performs the solo right before the opera section. Then the opera section begins, he walks off stage. Doing the headbanging section Roger comes up on the Heartbreak Hotel platform and Brian runs back on stage (only at Dominion Theatre. Elsewhere Roger's drum kit is being pushed by stage crew and Brian runs on stage.) They perform the headbanging section with the cast and the low key section. They end it all with a big ending before the stage goes into blackout.
Characters.
Galileo Figaro – The central character of the musical; a dreamer who hears strange words in his head. He is eventually revealed to be a reincarnation of Freddie Mercury. The character's name is a reference to the lyrics in the Queen song "Bohemian Rhapsody".
Scaramouche – A sarcastic, cynical character and Galileo's love interest. In the finale she shows talent playing the electric guitar, and Galileo declares that she is a reincarnation of Brian May, only this time "he's a babe". The character's name is a reference to the lyrics in the Queen song "Bohemian Rhapsody".
Killer Queen – The villain of the musical, she rules over iPlanet with an iron fist. The character's name is a reference to the Queen song "Killer Queen".

As a jukebox musical, the show's music consists entirely of Queen material. The musical numbers of the original London production are as follows.
Later in the London production, the "One Vision" sequence was changed to include Freddie Mercury's recorded vocals for the bridge. Previously, the bridge had been sung by the ensemble.
In the original London production, "Fat-Bottomed Girls" was a short instrumental interlude prior to "Another One Bites the Dust". Subsequent international productions expanded the song into a full song and dance sequence. Due to the positive response, the change was transferred back to the London production.
For the single-act Las Vegas production, "Who Wants to Live Forever" is replaced by "You're My Best Friend". In the 2013-2014 North American tour, "You're My Best Friend" is added after "I Want It All." "Who Wants To Live Forever" is reinstated, after "Flash and "Seven Seas of Rhye."
For the Australasian tour, Canadian production and the 2013-14 North American tour, "Play the Game" is replaced by "Now I'm Here".
For the revamped Canadian production and the 2013-14 North American tour, "One Vision" is removed. "Flash" and "Seven Seas Of Rhye" are repositioned to the start of Act Two.
On special occasions, "The Show Must Go On" is added to the encore.

Ben Vorlich (Loch Lomond)

Ben Vorlich (Scottish Gaelic: Beinn Mhùrlaig) is a Scottish mountain situated between the northernmost section of Loch Lomond and Loch Sloy. It is one of the Arrochar Alps, though it lies separate from the other peaks in the range, as indicated by the large topographic prominence.
The A82 road and the West Highland railway line run on the eastern side of Ben Vorlich, above the shoreline of Loch Lomond.
The peak forms a north-south ridge on the western side of Loch Lomond, with a subsidiary ridge known as "Little Hills" running from the summit east down to the shores of the loch. There are three small summits around 800 m apart along the main ridge; the central one is the highest, though the southern one has a trig point. 
Unlike many Scottish peaks, there is no single route up Ben Vorlich that is used to the virtual exclusion of all other. Most walkers elect to follow one of the ridges: several points on the southern ridge may be reached by way of the track leading to Loch Sloy, the Little Hills can be climbed from Ardvorlich on the lochside and an ascent of the northern ridge is usually commenced from a point between Ardlui and Inverarnan.

POMCUS

POMCUS (Prepositioning Of Materiel Configured in Unit Sets) was a system that kept large amounts of pre-positioned U.S. military equipment in West Germany during the Cold War.
In the event of war with the Soviets, American soldiers could be flown with their take-along-with troops (TAT) gear on Civil Reserve Air Fleet commercial airliners to use this pre-positioned equipment. The equipment was set up in unit configurations to aid in force building and movement to support the US Army's general defensive plan (GDP). By the late 1980s, the plan had evolved to send three divisions over in the first week of a conflict, and one division per week thereafter. Originally, POMCUS sites were primarily simply guarded, fenced-in lots of pre-loaded, maintained vehicles and weapons systems ready to roll, although the precursor to POMCUS sites was a series of underground storage areas liberated from the Germans in Pirmasens and the outlying areas Husterhoeh Kaserne utilized to store combat-readied armor. During the late 1960s-1980s, the above-ground POMCUS facilities were updated into large aluminum-over-steel warehouses, which provided the benefits of less weathering and lower maintenance requirements for the systems stored in them, as well as providing first-line defense against EMP radiation which could affect the electronics in both the communications systems and the recently implemented solid-state ignition systems on some vehicles.

Astylos of Croton

Astylos of Croton (Ἄστυλος/Ἀστύαλος ὁ Κροτωνιάτης) was an athlete from ancient Croton that starred in the Olympic Games of the 5th century BC. He was mentioned in records from General Pausanias that claim he excelled in three successive Olympic games from 488 to 480 BC, in the running events of "stade" and "diaulos".
Astylos was famous for equaling the achievements of previous champion athlete Chionis of Sparta. Astylos not only matched the achievements of Chionis, in that he won on three separate occasions the stade and diaulos events, he also won the "hoplites" event, which was a running race with full armoured suits.
Despite his fame, Astylos died a lonely man. When he agreed to participate in the 484 and 480 BC Olympic games as a Syracusan citizen in honor of the tyrant Hieron, the people of Croton expelled him from the city and demolished his statue in their city. It is also said that Astylos was bribed by officials in Syracuse to compete under their name, giving Astylos the unusual claim-to-fame of being the world's first free agent. His house was also turned into a prison as a sign of disrespect, while his family also renounced him.

Bristol Community Church

Bristol Community Church (formerly the Bristol New Covenant Church) is a charismatic church located in Kingswood, Bristol, England.
History.
The Bristol New Covenant Church was set up in 1984 by Dave Jones, a pastor from Bath; before its foundation some people from the area would travel to Bath City Church. The name was changed to Bristol Community Church in the 1990s because confusion around the word "covenant" in its name was leading people to believe that the church was a cult.
The Church met at a number of different venues around the city before moving to its current home, Bourne Chapel in Two Mile Hill Road, Kingswood, a former Primitive Methodist building erected in 1873, which had previously been part of an underwear factory.

Alte Weser (lighthouse)

The Alte Weser Lighthouse is located offshore from the estuary mouth of the river Weser in the German Bight, southern North Sea.
It was built on sand between 1961 and 1964. The Alte Weser lighthouse took over duties and replaced the historical Roter Sand lighthouse on September 1, 1964. The latter had been built from 1883 to 1885.
General aspects.
The "Alte Weser" lighthouse was built between 1961 and 1964. It consists of steel-coated ferroconcrete and a steel superstructure. It was built offshore into a sand bed at a depth of 11 m below mean sea level. Its height measures about 40m above msl. Depending on the color of the light beam, its visibility is between 18 and 23 sm. 
The only inhabited place where the Alte Weser or Roter Sand lighthouse can be seen with the naked eye is the German island of Wangerooge.
Technical data.
The light characteristic is "F WRG", i.e. a continuous light, coloured white, red or green depending on the bearing of the lighthouse. The light is emitted by a 2000 Watts Xenon lamp. On low visibility conditions a foghorn sounds a signal, the Morse code letters "AL" with an intervall of one minute.
On the tower a number of additional navigational and meteorological devices are installed next to the optics. Directional antennae and a radar serve as means of security in the Weser approach while an anemometer and an automated tide gauge collect data on wind conditions and water levels. The tower has a built-in emergency power system and provides accommodation for a maintenance crew.
Construction.
The “Roter Sand“ lighthouse (German transl. “red sand“) is located in the "Outer-Weser" waterway in the German Bight, southern North Sea. At the end of the 1950s the lighthouse had been badly damaged by corrosion, corrasion, and leaching of its concrete. 
To replace the old lighthouse, the “Alte Weser” was built in the years 1961-1964 not far from the former location. Simultaneously, the conditions for the ships' traffic in the "Outer-Weser" waterway were intended to be improved and the new lighthouse was planned to be established as an offshore part of the radar chain on the Weser between Bremen and the North Sea (Fig. 1).
The novel form of the tower (Fig. 2), i.e. its downward tapering tower-shaft together with its cantilevered upper storeys was based on a design by engineer Andreas Carstens, Bremerhaven. The conical design of the tower was intended to minimize exposure to waves and drift ice. The German Waterway Administration, the "Wasser- und Schifffahrtsamt (WSA) Bremerhaven" as the responsible governmental agency, assigned the task of workmanship to a cooperative of companies: Philipp Holzmann, Strabag Bau AG, Hermann Moeller. This cooperative instructed the Howaldtswerke in Kiel to carry out the steelworks.
The steelwork's for the tower-shaft, the upper storeys and the equipment were carried out in a dry dock of the Howaldts-factory in Kiel (Fig. 3). The tower-shaft was towed through the Kiel Canal towards its destination site in the Outer-Weser waterway (Fig. 6). For this purpose a floating offshore-lift platform which had been supplied with a central cut-out for the tower was used. At the site the shaft was lowered and subsequently jetted into the sand to the intended depth. After feeding in a layer of underwater concrete, the shaft was evacuated and the additional layers of ferroconcrete were installed (Fig. 5). 
Frequently, adequate supply of building materials was hampered and delayed, because relatively small coasters had been contracted for transport, which were quite sensitive to the state of the sea and weather conditions. Timing was especially important in order to ensure joints were constructed correctly. To this end, all building materials needed for the underwater concrete had to arrive on time and without delay. Therefore, an optimal weather period was required.
A further interruption happened due to two accidents. The first was fatal when a sudden leak killed two workers. However, the exact reason for the accident was never fully revealed. The tower-shaft which had been lowered and jetted into the sand had to be abandoned. The upper storeys were detached and transported back to Kiel on the offshore-lift-platform for later use. One year later the upper storeys were re-used on a second tower-shaft nearby. The old stump of the tower-shaft remains underground today. The storm surge of 1962 which cost many human lives in Hamburg and other places on the German coast had no impact on the construction of the lighthouse. The first accident did however force a new start to the works in Kiel, causing a delay of one year. The second accident happened because of a malfunction of the gripper at the front legs of the offshore-lift-platform. A second platform had to be used in order to repair and replace the first one. In the third year, after the lift-platform had been repaired, the construction works resumed at the tower-shaft and were subsequently completed.
Next, the offshore-lift-platform could pick up the upper storeys which were still stored at Kiel (Fig. 6) to join them with the tower-shaft in the North Sea. Under favourable weather conditions the upper storeys were placed on top of the tower without complications (Fig. 7). Now, the completing works such as installation of the optics including the corresponding blinds and the installation of the standby sets were implemented. The power supply of the lighthouse demanded special attention. A 6 kV cable was run from the “Robbenplate” lighthouse (Fig. 1) towards “Alte Weser”, jetted in using a special device (“Einspuelstiefel”, Fig. 8) and threaded into the tower through a protective cable conduit. In addition, measures had to be taken to adopt the same cable for the planned “Tegeler Plate” lighthouse (see below). The foundation of the building was safeguarded with stone ballast poured down on bush mats against rinsing and water erosion. In 1964 the light of “Alte Weser” lighthouse went into service (Fig. 9). In 1972 the four keepers were displaced when the lighthouse became automated.
Tegeler Plate lighthouse.
As an additional improvement of the waterway conditions as implemented by the procedure as a whole (see above), construction of another lighthouse was essential. This effort simultaneously made it possible to take the light vessel `Bremen`out of service. As a location for the new lighthouse the Tegeler Plate sand bar was chosen. The tower-shaft as well as the upper storeys of the Tegeler Plate lighthouse were intended to be entirely built as steel construction. The tower-shaft's height of about 46 m as well as the local shallow water conditions (i.e. average low tide about 2.50 m above ground level) made it possible to pile jet the tower-shaft 18 m deep into the sand in one step. To this end, jetting the tower-shaft into sand as a first step was considered to be followed by placing the upper storeys on top as a second step. In this manner corrections of slight discrepancies of the shaft could be made. 
After the steelworks had been carried out at Wilhelmhaven, the tower-shaft and the upper stories were brought to the intended position by a salvage ship carrying heavy water pump systems, and were jetted into the sandy ground. The power cable already installed at the “Alte Weser” lighthouse was integrated. The Tegeler Plate Lighthouse went into service in 1966 – it was unmanned and operated remotely from the beginning. Only emergency quarters were set up for maintenance workers. The base was secured through stone ballasting.
With these arrangements two important steps for the deepening project of the Outer Weser waterway had been accomplished.
In popular culture.
Alte Weser lighthouse was featured on a German stamp in 1976.
Alte Weser lighthouse as well as Tegeler Plate, Roter Sand and others were shown on various paintings by Katharina Noack.

<doc id="2845486" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2845486" title="Coconut water">
Coconut water

Coconut water is the clear liquid inside young green coconuts (fruits of the coconut palm). In early development, it serves as a suspension for the endosperm of the coconut during their nuclear phase of development. As growth continues, the endosperm mature into their cellular phase and deposit into the rind of the coconut meat. Coconut water has long been a popular drink in the tropics, especially in India, Brazilian Coast, Southeast Asia, Pacific Islands, Africa, and the Caribbean, where it is available fresh, canned, or bottled. Coconuts for drinking are served fresh, chilled or packaged in many places. They are often sold by street vendors who cut them open with machetes or similar implements in front of customers. Coconut water can also be found in ordinary cans, tetra paks, or plastic bottles (sometimes with coconut pulp or coconut jelly included). Bottled coconut water has a shelf life of 24 months.
In recent years, coconut water has been marketed as a natural energy or sports drink due to its high potassium and mineral content. Marketers have also promoted coconut water for having low levels of fat, carbohydrates, and calories. However, marketing claims attributing tremendous health benefits to coconut water are largely unfounded.
Unless the coconut has been damaged, it is likely sterile. There is a single documented case where coconut water has been used as an intravenous hydration fluid when medical saline was unavailable. Although this is not generally recommended by most physicians today, it was a common practice during the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979.
Composition.
Coconut water has a high potassium content and contains antioxidants. It also contains cytokinins which promote plant cell division and growth.
Other biologically active ingredients in coconut water include L-arginine, ascorbic acid and magnesium.
Harvesting.
Fresh coconuts are typically harvested from the tree while they are green. A hole may be bored into the coconut to provide access to the liquid and meat. In young coconuts, the liquid and air may be under some pressure and may spray slightly when the inner husk is first penetrated. Coconuts which have fallen to the ground are susceptible to rot and damage from insects or animals.
Derivative products.
Coconut water can be fermented to produce coconut vinegar. It is also used to make "nata de coco", a jelly-like food.
Medical use.
It is said that coconut water is identical to human plasma and can be injected directly into the human bloodstream. The story has its origin from World War II where British and Japanese patients were given coconut water intravenously because saline solution was in short supply. 
Doctors today say that they wouldn’t be inclined to set up a coconut water IV for dehydrated patients. It could possibly cause elevated calcium and potassium, which could be dangerous. The Documentation Center of Cambodia has cited the practice of allowing untrained nurses to administer coconut water infusions in its list of medical practices for which the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia should be prosecuted for crimes against humanity.
Senicide.
In India, coconut water is traditionally used in the senicide of elderly family members known as Thalaikoothal. In this custom, the elderly person is given an extensive oil-bath early in the morning and subsequently made to drink glasses of tender coconut water in excess, which results in renal failure, high fever, fits, and death within a day or two. Renal failure is the principle outcome of untreated coconut water-induced hyperkalaemia.

<doc id="2845500" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2845500" title="Play therapy">
Play therapy

Play therapy is generally employed with children aged 3 through 11 and provides a way for them to express their experiences and feelings through a natural, self-guided, self-healing process. As children’s experiences and knowledge are often communicated through play, it becomes an important vehicle for them to know and accept themselves and others.
General.
Play therapy is a form of counseling or psychotherapy that uses play to communicate with and help people, especially children, to prevent or resolve psychosocial challenges. This is thought to help them towards better social integration, growth and development.
Play therapy can also be used as a tool of diagnosis. A play therapist observes a client playing with toys (play-houses, pets, dolls, etc.) to determine the cause of the disturbed behavior. The objects and patterns of play, as well as the willingness to interact with the therapist, can be used to understand the underlying rationale for behavior both inside and outside the session..
According to the psychodynamic view, people (especially children) will engage in play behavior in order to work through their interior obfuscations and anxieties. In this way, play therapy can be used as a self-help mechanism, as long as children are allowed time for "free play" or "unstructured play." Normal play is an essential component of healthy child development.
One approach to treatment is for play therapists to use a type of desensitization or relearning therapy to change disturbing behavior, either systematically or in less formal social settings. These processes are normally used with children, but are also applied with other pre-verbal, non-verbal, or verbally-impaired persons, such as slow-learners, or brain-injured or drug-affected persons.
History.
Play has been recognized as important since the time of Plato (429-347 B.C.) who reportedly observed, “you can discover more about a person in an hour of play than in a year of conversation.” In the eighteenth century Rousseau (1762/1930), in his book ‘Emile’ wrote about the importance of observing play as a vehicle to learn about and understand children. Friedrich Fröbel, in his book "The Education of Man" (1903), emphasized the importance of symbolism in play. He observed, “play is the highest development in childhood, for it alone is the free expression of what is in the child’s soul…. children’s play is not mere sport. It is full of meaning and import.” (Fröbel, 1903, p. 22) The first documented case, describing the therapeutic use of play, was in 1909 when Sigmund Freud published his work with “Little Hans.” Little Hans was a five-year-old child who was suffering from a simple phobia. Freud saw him once briefly and recommended that his father take note of Hans’ play to provide insights that might assist the child. The case of “Little Hans” was the first case in which a child’s difficulty was related to emotional factors.
Hermine Hug-Hellmuth (1921) formalized the play therapy process by providing children with play materials to express themselves and emphasize the use of the play to analyze the child. In 1919, Melanie Klein (1955) began to implement the technique of using play as a means of analyzing children under the age of six. She believed that child’s play was essentially the same as free association used with adults, and that as such, it was provide access to the child’s unconscious. Anna Freud (1946, 1965) utilized play as a means to facilitate positive attachment to the therapist and gain access to the child’s inner life.
In the 1930s David Levy (1938) developed a technique he called release therapy. His technique emphasized a structured approach. A child, who had experienced a specific stressful situation, would be allowed to engage in free play. Subsequently, the therapist would introduce play materials related to the stress-evoking situation allowing the child to reenact the traumatic event and release the associated emotions.
In 1955, Gove Hambidge expanded on Levy’s work emphasizing a “Structured Play Therapy” model, which was more direct in introducing situations. The format of the approach was to establish rapport, recreate the stress-evoking situation, play out the situation and then free play to recover.
Jesse Taft (1933) and Frederick Allen (1934) developed an approach they entitled relationship therapy. The primary emphasis is placed on the emotional relationship between the therapist and the child. The focus is placed on the child’s freedom and strength to choose.
Carl Rogers (1942) expanded the work of the relationship therapist and developed non-directive therapy, later called client-centered therapy (Rogers, 1951). Virginia Axline (1950) expanded on her mentor's concepts. In her article entitled ‘Entering the child’s world via play experiences’ Axline summarized her concept of play therapy stating, “A play experience is therapeutic because it provides a secure relationship between the child and the adult, so that the child has the freedom and room to state himself in his own terms, exactly as he is at that moment in his own way and in his own time” (Progressive Education, 27, p. 68).
In 1953 Clark Moustakas wrote his first book Children in Play Therapy. In 1956 he compiled Publication of The Self, the result of the dialogues between Abraham Maslow, Carl Rogers, Clark Moustakas and others, forging the Humanistic Psychology movement.
Filial therapy, developed by Bernard and Louise Guerney, was a new innovation in play therapy during the 1960s. The filial approach emphasizes a structured training program for parents in which they learn how to employ child-centered play sessions in the home. In the 1960s, with the advent of school counselors, school-based play therapy began a major shift from the private sector. Counselor-educators such as Alexander (1964); Landreth (1969, 1972); Muro (1968); Myrick and Holdin (1971); Nelson (1966); and Waterland (1970) began to contribute significantly, especially in terms of using play therapy as both an educational and preventive tool in dealing with children’s issues.
1973 Clark Moustakas continues his journey into play therapy and publishes his novel "The child's discovery of himself". Clark Moustakas' work as being concerned with the kind of relationship needed to make therapy a growth experience. His stages start with the child's feelings being generally negative and as they are expressed, they become less intense, the end results tend to be the emergence of more positive feelings and more balanced relationships. Today, his daughter Kerry Moustakas continues his legacy as an author and president of The Michigan School of Professional Psychology. 2004 Clark and Kerry Moustakas publish Loneliness, Creativity and Love: Awakening Meanings in Life.
Growth of organizations.
In 1982, the Association for Play Therapy (APT) was established marking not only the desire to promote the advancement of play therapy, but to acknowledge the extensive growth of play therapy. Currently, the APT has almost 5,000 members in twenty-six countries (2006). Play therapy training is provided, according to a survey conducted by the Center for Play Therapy at the University of North Texas (2000), by 102 universities and colleges throughout the United States. The APT provides certification in play therapy and play therapy supervision for clinicians. They also offer a list of play therapists by local and training opportunities.
In 1985, the work of two key Canadians in the field of child psychology and play therapy, Mark Barnes and Cynthia Taylor, resulted in the establishment of Certification Standards through the non-profit Canadian child psychotherapy and play therapy association. A fledgling group of practising Canadian child psychotherapists and play therapists worked on developing an organization to meet professional needs. It gradually expanded and eventually a Board of Directors was formed; objects and by-laws were designed, revised, re-revised and finally approved by the Government of Canada. The Canadian association was eventually recognized as a non-profit organization in 1986.
During 1995/1996, a whole new horizon opened up for the profession of play therapy as a result of the Canadian Play Therapy Institute's pioneering efforts on an International basis. Play Therapy International was founded from the Canadian Play Therapy Institute and there now existed a mutually supportive recognition between Play Therapy International/The International Board of Examiners of Certified Play Therapists, The Canadian Play Therapy Institute, as well as a number of other professional bodies throughout the world.
In the UK, The United Kingdom Society for Play and Creative Arts Therapies Limited (known in short as PTUK) was originally set up in October 2000 as Play Therapy UK with the encouragement of Play Therapy International. Meanwhile the British Association of Play Therapists was distinguished from its American counterpart in 1996 and was granted charity status within the UK in 2006 by the UK Charities Commission.
By 2010 Play Therapy International has partnered sister organisations in Ireland, Canada, Australasia, France, Spain, Wales, Malaysia, Romania, Russia, United Kingdom, Slovenia, Germany, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Korea and Ethiopia.
Models.
Play therapy can be divided into two basic types: nondirective and directive. Nondirective play therapy is a non-intrusive method in which children are encouraged to work toward their own solutions to problems through play. It is typically classified as a psychodynamic therapy. In contrast, directive play therapy is a method that includes more structure and guidance by the therapist as children work through emotional and behavioral difficulties through play. It often contains a behavioral component and the process includes more prompting by the therapist. Directive play therapy is more likely to be classified as a type of cognitive behavioral therapy. Both types of play therapy have received at least some empirical support. On average, play therapy treatment groups when compared to control groups improve by .8 standard deviations.
Nondirective play therapy.
Nondirective play therapy, also called client-centered and unstructured play therapy, is guided by the notion that if given the chance to speak and play freely under optimal therapeutic conditions, troubled children and young people will be able to resolve their own problems and work toward their own solutions. In other words, nondirective play therapy is regarded as non-intrusive. The hallmark of nondirective play therapy is that it has few boundary conditions and thus can be used at any age. This therapy originates from Carl Rogers's non-directive psychotherapy and in his characterization of the optimal therapeutic conditions. Virginia Axline adapted Carl Rogers's theories to child therapy in 1946 and is widely considered the founder of this therapy. Different techniques have since been established that fall under the realm of nondirective play therapy, including traditional sandplay therapy, family therapy, and play therapy with the use of toys. Each of these forms is covered briefly below.
Play therapy using a tray of sand and miniature figures is attributed to Margaret Lowenfeld, who established her "World Technique" in 1929. Dora Kalff combined Lowenfeld's World Technique with Jung's idea of the collective unconscious and received Lowenfeld's permission to name her version of the work "sandplay" (Kalff, 1980).
As in traditional nondirective play therapy, research has shown that allowing an individual to freely play with the sand and accompanying objects in the contained space of the sandtray (22.5" x 28.5") can facilitate a healing process as the unconscious expresses itself in the sand and influences the sand player. When a client creates in the sandtray, little instruction is provided and the therapist offers little or no talk during the process. This protocol emphasizes the importance of holding what Kalff (1980) referred to as the "free and protected space" to allow the unconscious to express itself in symbolic, non-verbal play. Upon completion of a tray, the client may or may not choose to talk about his or her creation, and the therapist, without the use of directives and without touching the sandtray, may offer supportive response that does not include interpretation. The rationale is that the therapist trusts and respects the process by allowing the images in the tray to exert their influence without interference.
Sand tray therapy can be used during family therapy. The limitations presented by the boundaries of the sandtray can serve as physical and symbolic limitations to families in which boundary distinctions are an issue. Also when a family works together on a sandtray, the therapist may make several observations, such as unhealthy alliances, who works with who, which objects are selected to be incorporated into the sandtray, and who chooses which objects. A therapist may assess these choices and intervene in an effort to guide the formation of healthier relationships.
Using toys in nondirective play therapy with children is another common method therapists employ, a method which was derived from the creative toys used in Freud's theoretical orientations. The idea behind this method is that children will be better able to express their feelings toward themselves and their environment through play with toys than through verbalization of their feelings. Through these actions, then, children may be able to experience catharsis, gain more or better insight into their consciousness, thoughts, and emotions, and test their own reality. Popular toys used during therapy are animals, dolls, hand puppets, crayons, and cars. Therapists have deemed toys such as these more likely to encourage dramatic play or creative associations, both of which are important in expression.
Efficacy.
Play therapy has been considered to be an established and popular mode of therapy for children for over sixty years. Critics of play therapy have questioned the effectiveness of the technique for use with children and have suggested using other interventions with greater empirical support such as cognitive behavioral therapy. They also argue that therapists focus more on the institution of play rather than the empirical literature when conducting therapy Classically, Lebo argued against the efficacy of play therapy in 1953, and Phillips reiterated his argument again in 1985. Both claimed that play therapy lacks in several areas of hard research. Many studies included small sample sizes, which limits the generalizeability, and many studies also only compared the effects of play therapy to a control group. Without a comparison to other therapies, it is difficult to determine if play therapy really is the most effective treatment. Recent play therapy researchers have worked to conduct more experimental studies with larger sample sizes, specific definitions and measures of treatment, and more direct comparisons.
Research is lacking on the overall effectiveness of using toys in nondirective play therapy. Dell Lebo found that out of a sample of over 4,000 children, those who played with recommended toys vs. non-recommended or no toys during nondirective play therapy were not more likely to verbally express themselves to the therapist. Examples of recommended toys would be dolls or crayons, while example of non-recommended toys would be marbles or a checker game. There is also ongoing controversy in choosing toys for use in nondirective play therapy, with choices being largely made through intuition rather than through research. However, other research shows that following specific criteria when choosing toys in nondirective play therapy can make treatment more efficacious. Criteria for a desirable treatment toy include a toy that facilitates contact with the child, encourages catharsis, and lead to play that can be easily interpreted by a therapist.
Several meta analyses have shown promising results toward the efficacy of nondirective play therapy. Meta analysis by authors LeBlanc and Ritchie, 2001, found an effect size of 0.66 for nondirective play therapy. This finding is comparable to the effect size of 0.71 found for psychotherapy used with children, indicating that both nondirective play and non-play therapies are almost equally effective in treating children with emotional difficulties. Meta analysis by authors Ray, Bratton, Rhine and Jones, 2001, found an even larger effect size for nondirective play therapy, with children performing at 0.93 standard deviations better than non-treatment groups. These results are stronger than previous meta-analytic results, which reported effect sizes of 0.71, 0.71, and 0.66. Meta analysis by authors Bratton, Ray, Rhine, and Jones, 2005, also found a large effect size of 0.92 for children being treated with nondirective play therapy. Results from all meta-analyses indicate that nondirective play therapy has been shown to be just as effective as psychotherapy used with children and even generates higher effect sizes in some studies.
There are several predictors that may also influence the effectiveness of play therapy with children. Number of sessions is a significant predictor in post-test outcomes, with more sessions being indicative of higher effect sizes. Although positive effects can be seen with the average 16 sessions, there is a peak effect when a child can complete 35-40 sessions. An exception to this finding is children undergoing play therapy in critical-incident settings, such as hospitals and domestic violence shelters. Results from studies that looked at these children indicated a large positive effect size after only 7 sessions, which provides the implication that children in crisis may respond more readily to treatment Parental involvement is also a significant predictor of positive play therapy results. This involvement generally entails participation in each session with the therapist and the child. Parental involvement in play therapy sessions has also been shown to diminish stress in the parent-child relationship when kids are exhibiting both internal and external behavior problems. Despite these predictors which have been shown to increase effect sizes, play therapy has been shown to be equally effective across age, gender, and individual vs. group settings.
Directive play therapy.
Directive play therapy is guided by the notion that using directives to guide the child through play will cause a faster change than is generated by nondirective play therapy. The therapist plays a much bigger role in directive play therapy. Therapists may use several techniques to engage the child, such as engaging in play with the child themselves or suggesting new topics instead of letting the child direct the conversation himself. Stories read by directive therapists are more likely to have an underlying purpose, and therapists are more likely to create interpretations of stories that children tell. In directive therapy games are generally chosen for the child, and children are given themes and character profiles when engaging in doll or puppet activities. This therapy still leaves room for free expression by the child, but it is more structured than nondirective play therapy. There are also different established techniques that are used in directive play therapy, including directed sandtray therapy and cognitive behavioral play therapy.
Directed sandtray therapy is more commonly used with trauma victims and involves the "talk" therapy to a much greater extent. Because trauma is often debilitating, directed sandplay therapy works to create change in the present, without the lengthy healing process often required in traditional sandplay therapy. This is why the role of the therapist is important in this approach. Therapists may ask clients questions about their sandtray, suggest them to change the sandtray, ask them to elaborate on why they chose particular objects to put in the tray, and on rare occasions, change the sandtray themselves. Use of directives by the therapist is very common. While traditional sandplay therapy is thought to work best in helping clients access troubling memories, directed sandtray therapy is used to help people manage their memories and the impact it has had on their lives.
Roger Phillips, in the early 1980s, was one of the first to suggest that combining aspects of cognitive behavioral therapy with play interventions would be a good theory to investigate. Cognitive behavioral play therapy was then developed to be used with very young children between two and six years of age. It incorporates aspects of Beck's cognitive therapy with play therapy because children may not have the developed cognitive abilities necessary for participation in straight cognitive therapy. In this therapy, specific toys such as dolls and stuffed animals may be used to model particular cognitive strategies, such as effective coping mechanisms and problem-solving skills. Little emphasis is placed on the children's verbalizations in these interactions but rather on their actions and their play. Creating stories with the dolls and stuffed animals is a common method used by cognitive behavioral play therapists in order to change children's maladaptive thinking.
Efficacy.
The efficacy of directive play therapy has been less established than that of nondirective play therapy, yet the numbers still indicate that this mode of play therapy is also effective. In 2001 meta analysis by authors Ray, Bratton, Rhine, and Jones, direct play therapy was found to have an effect size of .73 compared to the .93 effect size that nondirective play therapy was found to have. Similarly in 2005 meta analysis by authors Bratton, Ray, Rhine, and Jones, directive therapy had an effect size of 0.71, while nondirective play therapy had an effect size of 0.92. Although the effect sizes of directive therapy are statistically significantly lower than those of nondirective play therapy, they are still comparable to the effect sizes for psychotherapy used with children, demonstrated by Casey, Weisz, and LeBlanc. A potential reason for the difference in the effect size may be due to the amount of studies that have been done on nondirective vs. directive play therapy. Approximately 73 studies in each meta analysis examined nondirective play therapy, while there were only 12 studies that looked at directive play therapy. Once more research is done on directive play therapy, there is potential that effect sizes between nondirective and directive play therapy will be more comparable.
Parent/child play therapy.
Several approaches to play therapy have been developed for parents to use in the home with their own children.
Training in nondirective play for parents has been shown to significantly reduce mental health problems in at-risk preschool children. One of the first parent/child play therapy approaches developed was Filial Therapy (in the 1960s - see History section above), in which parents are trained to facilitate nondirective play therapy sessions with their own children. Filial therapy has been shown to help children work through trauma and also resolve behavior problems.
Another approach to play therapy that involves parents is Theraplay, which was developed in the 1970s. At first, trained therapists worked with children, but Theraplay later evolved into an approach in which parents are trained to play with their children in specific ways at home. Theraplay is based on the idea that parents can improve their children’s behavior and also help them overcome emotional problems by engaging their children in forms of play that replicate the playful, attuned, and empathic interactions of a parent with an infant. Studies have shown that Theraply is effective in changing children’s behavior, especially for children suffering from attachment disorders.
In the 1980s, Stanley Greenspan developed Floortime, a comprehensive, play-based approach for parents and therapists to use with autistic children. There is evidence for the success of this program with children suffering from autistic spectrum disorders.
Lawrence Cohen has created an approach called Playful Parenting, in which he encourages parents to play with their children to help resolve emotional and behavioral issues. Parents are encouraged to connect playfully with their children through silliness, laughter, and roughhousing.
In 2006, Garry Landreth and Sue Bratton devleoped a highly researched and structured way of teaching parents to engage in therapeutic play with their children. It is based on a supervised entry level training in child centered play therapy. They named it Child Parent Relationship Therapy. These 10 sessions focus on parenting issues in a group environment and utilizes video and audio recordings to help the parents receive feedback on their 30 minute 'special play times' with their children.
More recently, Aletha Solter has developed a comprehensive approach for parents called Attachment Play, which describes evidence-based forms of play therapy, including nondirective play, more directive symbolic play, contingency play, and several laughter-producing activities. Parents are encouraged to use these playful activities to strengthen their connection with their children, resolve discipline issues, and also help the children work through traumatic experiences such as hospitalization or parental divorce.

Keydata Corporation

Keydata Corporation was one of the first companies in the time-sharing business in the 1960s. It was the brainchild of Charles W. Adams, an entrepreneur who had founded "Adams Associates" who are best remembered as the authors of computer equipment surveys during this period.
Keydata was located in Technology Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where project MAC, the seminal venture sponsored by MIT which saw the developmemt of MULTICS one of the earliest time sharing software systems. UNIX is a derivative of MULTICS. In addition, IBM's Scientific Development center was located in Technology Square and this R&D center developed the first IBM virtual memory system computer. This was initially installed on a modified IBM System/360 Model 40 computer with the informal name of the "Cambridge box." Later IBM used modernized technology for the 360/67 and, today, all modern computers use "virtual memory."
The coincident location of the nexus of time sharing and virtual memory developers in Cambridge resulted in a heady climate of information technology state-of-the-art knowledge sharing which Keydata profited by, although its UNIVAC computer architecture permitted only software-based implementations. At the time, the fashion was the idea that computer power would be made available on a network connection of a "dumb" terminal to a "smart" mainframe computer utility, sharing mammoth computer power with thousands, if not millions, of users.
Keydata used a UNIVAC 490 computer to provide commercial applications such as inventory management and accounting applications on a network basis to slow Teletype-based terminals in customer locations and replaced in-house computers and other services with its highly customized parameter-driven distribution and manufacturing applications.
Other seminal services were initially implemented on this service, such as Instinet, a stock trading service now owned by Reuters which trades large block transactions on US securities markets, and a very early network inventory network application for Shell Oil company.
At its peak, Keydata had hundreds of customers on-line but was never able to compete with emerging micro-computer applications which took over the market, at first, with copies of Keydata developed applications.

Bast fibre

Bast fibre or skin fibre is plant fibre collected from the phloem (the "inner bark" or the skin) or bast surrounding the stem of certain, mainly dicotyledonous plants. They support the conductive cells of the phloem and provide strength to the stem. Most of the technically important bast fibres are obtained from herbs cultivated in agriculture, as for instance flax, hemp, or ramie, but also bast fibres from wild plants, as stinging nettle, and trees such as lime or linden, have been used to some extent. Since the valuable fibres are located in the phloem, they must often be separated from the xylem material ("woody core"), and sometimes also from epidermis. The process for this is called retting, and can be performed by micro-organisms either on land (nowadays the most important) or in water, or by chemicals (for instance high pH and chelating agents) or by pectinolytic enzymes. In the phloem bast fibres occur in bundles that are glued together by pectin and calcium ions. More intense retting separates the fibre bundles into elementary fibres, that can be several centimetres long. Often bast fibres have higher tensile strength than other kinds, and are used in high-quality textiles (sometimes in blends with cotton or synthetic fibres), ropes, yarn, paper, composite materials and burlap. An important, notable property of bast fibres is that they contain a special structure, the "fibre node", that represents a weak point. Seed hairs, such as cotton, do not have nodes.
Examples are: 
Use of bast fibre.
Bast fibres are processed for use in carpet, yarn, rope, geotextile (netting or matting), traditional carpets, hessian or burlap, paper, sacks, etc. Bast fibres are also used in the non-woven, moulding, and composite technology industries for the manufacturing of non-woven mats and carpets, composite boards as furniture materials, automobile door panels and headliners, etc. From prehistoric times through at least the early 20th century, bast shoes were woven from bast strips in the forest areas of Eastern Europe.
Where no other source of tanbark was available, bast has also been used for tanning leather.

Snowking Winter Festival

The Snowking Winter Festival is an annual festival held each March in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada.
The festival is a major winter tourist draw to Yellowknife. It centres around the snow castle, built from snow with window panes of ice. Each winter the castle is built on Yellowknife Bay, on Great Slave Lake. The castle is designed and the construction is supervised by Snowking, Anthony Foliot. The design evolves every year and the castle has grown to include an auditorium, cafe, courtyard, traditional igloo, slide, parapets and turrets.
Once it is completed, the snow castle becomes the centre of winter arts activity in Yellowknife. The month-long festival includes concerts, art shows, children's theatre, fireworks shows and so much more. Carvers augment the castle with snow and ice sculptures. 
History.
The first Snowking castle was built in 1996. From humble beginnings in Yellowknife's Woodyard neighbourhood, where the castle was little more than tunnels in snowbanks augmented by blocks of snow cut from wind-formed snow drifts, the Snowking's Winter Festival has grown into a month-long event based around a large castle built of snow.
In the early years, Snowking and Sir Shiverin' Sam built forts of snow with their children near their homes on the shore of Yellowknife Bay. Over the years, the "castle" grew, and at some point moved out onto the ice of the bay. Each year the structure became larger and more elaborate. Crew members came and went over the years, but the Snowking remained dedicated to his kingdom. Funding was secured so that the castle could continue to operate and to grow each year. In 2009, the Government of Canada provided $16,900 of funding for the 2009 festival via the "Building Communities Through Arts and Heritage Program" of the Department of Canadian Heritage. In 2004, Foliot received $5,000 from the Northwest Territories Business Development Fund for the operation of the festival.
The castle has become a much-appreciated part of the community. The structure itself has become grander, and the festival plays host to more and more events, providing a unique venue for music and the arts. As a temporary cultural centre, Snowking's castle has become an institution in Yellowknife.
Construction.
It is known that the majority of planning, building, and fund-raising/organizing are done by five key characters: Snowking, Sir Shiverin' Sam, Joe Snow, Snowbank Frank and Snowbelle. These five have worked together since approximately 2006 to ensure the continued success of the festival. Other builders include Mr. Freeze, Jack Frost, and Dug Some Snow. A first year builder is referred to as a "snowprentice".
Pre-construction work begins in early November. At this time, crew members cut panes of ice from the frozen lake surface. These blocks of ice are about six inches thick and are cut into a variety of heights and widths. They are stockpiled near the future location of the castle and will be used for window panes and table tops.
Construction of the castle itself begins on January 1 each year, and takes about two months.
In the early years of the castle all construction was done with blocks of snow, stacking them into walls and building arched entrances and tunnels. Today blocks continue to have a role in the castle but the vast majority of building is done by "pouring" snow into wooden forms, much like concrete work. This "snowcrete" can be shaped into all manner of structure. Walls, rooms, and roofs are all possible.
After two months of playing in the snow, the crew stands back to examine their work. And on opening night of the festival, they present their masterpiece to the public.
The Festival.
It has become tradition that the castle's opening night is celebrated with a fireworks display. As many as 2,000 people venture out onto the ice to watch the show. Snowking addresses his subjects, welcoming them to another castle season.
Throughout the month of March, the castle hosts a film night, children's plays on the weekends, and live music most Friday and Saturday nights. It also host puppet shows and hockey games. Films are projected directly onto the snow walls. Plays are written and produced in Yellowknife. Musical events feature both local and visiting artists, providing a new venue for Yellowknifers, and an opportunity to hear musicians from elsewhere. The "Block 1,000 Rock and Roll Party" is an example. Tuesday nights have become "jam nights," an opportunity for anybody to take the stage and perform in the castle. Normally one night is reserved for the "Royal Rave", which is usually a multimedia performance featuring several DJs.
The highlight of the season is Snowking's Royal Ball, which is always a fiddle dance. Usually there are a number of talented fiddle players, and, if possible, a caller. 
In the past, some events have attracted up to 200 guests. Popular performers have included Leela Gilday and Indio Saravanja and many others. 
As of 2009, the castle has hosted nine weddings, with three more are booked for 2010. The first wedding was held during the 2000 festival.
In the past there has been a "Snowtel" - a room of the castle that is intended for visitors to stay overnight - but demand is minimal, and this feature is no longer built.
Usually the castle season ends with another display of fireworks. 
In the media.
The festival has received much local, territorial, national and international media attention. Snowking has been featured on CTV’s, "Valerie Pringle Has Left the Building" hosted by Valerie Pringle as well as CBC television’s, Rick Mercer Report hosted by Rick Mercer. Snowking had visits from Ben Mulroney, the host of Canadian Idol and from the History Channel when they were in the north filming Ice Road Truckers. Season One of Ice Pilots NWT shows a wedding at Snowking 14. Snowking has been featured in stories on Shelagh Rogers' CBC Radio program, Sounds Like Canada and CBC television’s “On The Road Again”, hosted by Wayne Ronstad. 
The Snowking Winter Festival was chosen by the Canadian Tourism Commission as one of four Northern events to represent the Northwest Territories at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics.
In 2009, Collective 9 created a feature documentary of the Snowking’s 14th Annual Winter Festival called "Triumph of the Chill" which is a documentary film about the construction and celebration of the castle.

A. J. Hackett

Alan John "A. J." Hackett (born May 1958) is a New Zealand entrepreneur who popularised the extreme sport of bungy jumping. He made the famous bungy jump from the Eiffel Tower in 1987 and founded the first commercial bungy site in 1988.
Early life.
Hackett was born in Pukekohe, growing up on Auckland's North Shore. He attended Westlake Boys High School between 1972 and 1974, where he played rugby. He left school at the age of sixteen to serve an apprenticeship as a carpenter-joiner. During this time he took up snowboarding and skiing. He moved to Perth where he sold encyclopedias for four months, later returning to New Zealand to set up a construction business.
Bungy jumping.
Inspired by the Vanuatu ritual called land diving and the Oxford University Dangerous Sports Club experimental jumps in the 1970s, Hackett and fellow adventurer Chris Sigglekow, sought ways to make bungy jump safe. Using a mathematical formula developed by New Zealand's Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, he created a super-stretchy elastic bungy cord in the mid-1980s.
In November 1986, Hackett, along with Sigglekow, performed his first amateur bungy jump from the Upper Harbour Bridge (Greenhithe Bridge) in Auckland, citing it as "one of the most riveting experiences of my life." Following this Hackett made jumps from a bridge in Hamilton, the Auckland Harbour Bridge and other bridges in the North Island. These first jumps were made using a parachute harness, however, Hackett created a method where the harness was tied to the ankle and demonstrated its use by jumping off the Auckland Harbour Bridge a second time.
Hackett travelled to Paris in 1986 as part of the New Zealand Speed Skiing Team. While there he jumped off the 147m Pont de la Caille and a cable car at the Tignes ski resort in Paris. He made what became a famous bungy jump off the Eiffel Tower in Paris on 26 June 1987, generating international attention to the sport.
Back in New Zealand, Hackett launched his own company, AJ Hackett Bungy, and created a site on the Kawarau Gorge Suspension Bridge in Queenstown, New Zealand in 1988 to become the world's first commercial public bungy. He later expanded his company by founding bungy sites in Australia, France (Souleuvre Viaduct in Normandy), Germany, The United States, Mexico, Indonesia, and Macau. He is credited with launching New Zealand's adventure tourism industry and helping to develop a safe code of operation for bungy jumping in use internationally. Hackett initially partnered with Henry van Asch, but the two split in 1997 with van Asch taking over the New Zealand-based business. In 2008 the pair reunited - and currently work together on the AJ Hackett business. In 2006 Hackett published his autobiography, "Jump Start", which chronicles his bungy jumping adventures.
Records and accomplishments.
Hackett is widely known for his many bungy stunts that have earned him Guinness records and personal milestones, including:
On 6 November 2007, Hackett was honoured by New Zealand television show "This Is Your Life".
His company, AJ Hackett Bungy, was recognized by Westpac Queenstown Chamber of Commerce with a Business Excellence Award in the large business category.

Missing People (previously known as National Missing Persons Helpline) is a national organisation in the United Kingdom that offers assistance to people who run away and/or go missing and their families. It is a registered charity under English law.
Mission.
Missing People's mission is to be a lifeline when someone disappears.
Vision.
That every missing person is found safe.
Services.
Missing People provides the following services:
Missing People events.
International Missing Children’s Day is one day a year when people remember missing children and their families. The charity mark this day by holding their Big Tweet for Missing Children. For 24 hours the charity harnesses the power of twitter to publicise missing children appeals. The charity tweets a different missing child appeal every 30 minutes for 24 hours and are supported in this by a range of celebrities and organisations. In 2013 The Big Tweet for Missing Children was sponsored by The Sun newspaper and celebrities including Simon Cowell and Stephen Fry endorsed the campaign making it the most successful Big Tweet in the charity’s history. Missing People's Twitter handle is @MissingPeople.
Miles for Missing People is an annual running event held by the charity Missing People. The popular event, includes a 10K, a 3K and a kids run as well as entertainment and family activities, is held on or around the 25th May to mark International Missing Children’s Day. Hundreds of supporters and families of missing people join together to participate in the races and fundraise for the charity raising thousands of pounds for the charity’s work.
The Missing People Cycle Challenge is another of Missing People’s popular challenge events which takes place in June or July each year and involves groups of cyclists cycling from Edinburgh to London over a five day period. The tough challenge is an incredibly rewarding and moving experience for the participants as they support each other through the intense five day experience in order to raise funds to help support the families of Missing People. More information on taking part in the Cycle Challenge or other Missing People challenges can be found at https://www.missingpeople.org.uk/missing-people/fundraising/challenge-events.
History.
Early years (1986–89)
NMPH Following the high profile disappearance of estate agent Suzy Lamplugh from Fulham in July 1986, two sisters Janet Newman and Mary Asprey, became the co-founders of National Missing Persons Helpline. With no news of Suzy's whereabouts media attention moved to the apparent lack of support for missing persons' families, such as Paul and Diane Lamplugh. Mary with her sister, Janet Newman, established the Trust's initial work on missing people.
The helpline (1990–92)
From a bedroom at the sisters' home in East Sheen, south west London, a start-up service was formed in early 1990. The Freefone number, 0500 700 700, remains the same today. Meanwhile the Suzy Lamplugh Trust moved towards issues surrounding personal safety and safety in the workplace. Initially Mary and Janet and a small team of volunteers simply comforted callers to the helpline. However, they soon realised families wanted more than just telephone support. In 1992, having re-mortgaged their houses, Mary and Janet applied to register National Missing Persons Helpline (NMPH) as a charity.
Expansion (1993)
By the time it became a registered charity in April 1993, NMPH needed new offices to provide a complete range of services for relatives, enabling the charity to both find and support. This expansion was greatly helped by founders of the Big Issue, who secured premises in Mortlake. Missing People is still based here today. ITN's Sir Trevor McDonald – later to become a Vice Patron instigated invaluable publicity. Where funding allowed, new staff and volunteers joined and the information taken from each caller regarding a disappearance became more detailed and more accurate. A department offering Publicity was born. The success of the charity was cemented in its first year by an office visit from Diana, Princess of Wales in October.
Getting the Message Home (1994)
In February 1994 the resources of NMPH were stretched to the limit by the horrific discoveries at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester. Calls to the helpline from relatives of missing people trebled and extra volunteers had to be brought in to answer the phones. New callers reported relatives missing for the first time, even though some had vanished ten years ago or even more. Distressed families already in touch with the helpline called again, in case their missing relative might figure in the investigation. The police directed anxious families to NMPH for comfort and support. Gloucestershire Police called too, seeking help on identifying the bodies found at Cromwell Street and elsewhere. Their initial interest was in women reported missing from Worcestershire and Gloucestershire in the 1970s and 1980s. Some 390 names were supplied including Alison Chambers and Carol Cooper who were later identified as victims. At the same time, details mentioned by Frederick West were passed to NMPH for checking against our database. One result of this was the identification of Juanita Mott another of the victims discovered at Cromwell Street. A positive side effect of the charities role in the investigation was the reunion of 110 non-victim families in less than two months. On 27 June 1994 the charity took over the Message Home Helpline from the Mothers' Union, allowing adult missing people to pass a message home. In response to NMPH's growing achievements the charity was honoured that HRH The Duchess of Gloucester GCVO accepted the role of Patron. The Duchess continues to attend performances on our behalf and raise morale of staff and volunteers with regular visits.
Recognition (1996–1998)
In 1996 Mary Asprey and Janet Newman were honoured for their services to charity with OBEs. In 1998 both were honoured with the "UK Women of Europe Award" and in the same year given the European Women of Achievement Humanitarianism Award and The Rotary Foundation's prestigious Paul Harris Fellowships.
Lost from View (2002)
The charity celebrated its 10th birthday. Jointly with the University of York, NMPH produced "Lost from View" in February 2002. Funded by the Nuffield Foundation, for the first time research used the charity's unique database of all types of missing people to provide information and trends about the missing phenomenon.
Pioneering work (2003–2004)
Further accolades followed in 2003 when Mary and Janet were invited by The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh to a reception at Buckingham Palace to mark the contribution of Pioneers to the life of the Nation. 2003 also saw the national roll out of the 'Missing from Care' project for local authorities 'looked after children' in September. This work for young people continued in May 2004 when NMPH launched the Runaway Helpline, as a direct response to a recommendation in the 2002 report by The Social Exclusion Task Force.
Financial problems (2005–2006)
Faced with closure after years of inadequate funding and little input from the private sector, the media announced NMPH was to close. Under the direction of the co-Founders Sir Norman Wakefield was appointed as advisor and formed a consortium of charitable organisations that offered financial support. After an outpouring of public support the Home Office too announced emergency funding for the charity. In September 2005, Paul Tuohy joined the charity as their first Chief Executive. The charity reformed its Board of Trustees and started a considerable process of strategic planning.
New Endings (2007–2008)
In May 2007–2008 the charity relaunched as "Missing People". This reflected the considerable strategic developments that had been made and the fact that the charity now provided a range of services rather than a single helpline. Also in May, less than one week after her disappearance, missing three-year-old Madeleine McCann had become headline news around the globe. On International Missing Children’s Day (26 May) an appeal by the charity was projected onto Marble Arch to highlight Madeleine’s disappearance and the plight of missing children across the UK. In August Missing People launched the first comprehensive online “missing map” in the UK and Missing People TV’ – the first online channel featuring appeals of missing people. In October the charity along with other NGOs from the English Coalition for Runaway Children asked the government to ‘stop missing the missing issue’. This led to the government developing a strategy on the protection of young runaways for the first time ever. In 2007 the charity also teamed up with the police to hold their first joint conference on “missing”. Delegates came from across the globe came to Blackpool to debate and learn about the latest developments. In November 2007 Missing People won two awards for its website – which received more than 40 million hits in its first year. In December the BBC launched ‘Reunited’ – a season of hard hitting programmes about family members seeking to contact missing relatives and the complex reasons people run away.
Finding Missing People and Supporting Families (2008)
In March 2009 hundreds of families of the missing joined together to march through London to highlight the impact of someone going missing on their family, whilst Radiohead supported the charity with the donation of an exclusive one-off remix tape. April saw the first of the award-winning series Missing Live on BBC One. Successes included finding more than 100 people over the four week show. Missing People’s financial position was strengthened by a landmark decision by the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) to grant the charity £310,000 in June 2008 and by the appointment of five new trustees, which led to a shortlisting at the Third Sector Awards 2009 for most improved Trustee Board. In October 2009 Missing People and Iceland supermarket teamed up to launch milk carton appeals for the missing, following on from the success of a previous initiative with Iceland which had helped to find more than 17 people across millions of cartons. The first new appeal was for Andrew Gosden, a 13-year-old boy last seen at King’s Cross Station. In December 2009 Missing People launched the first report into the experiences of, and impacts on, the families of missing people called ‘Living in Limbo’. Also in December Missing People teamed up with 95.8 Capital FM to launch the Runaway Helpline text service, the first free helpline text service for young people, which was funded by Vodafone Foundation.
116xxx telephone number issued (2009)
In 2009, Ofcom introduced the first harmonised European numbers for harmonised services of social value, allocating 116 000 to the Missing People service. This number is free to call from mobiles and landlines.
Working with the police.
Missing People works in partnership with police forces and other agencies across the UK to help find missing children and adults and support their family or carer. Missing people offers publicity opportunities to police forces and at the request of the police Missing People can send a missing person a text message informing them about the charity and the support we can offer. These services are available at no direct cost to police forces, the missing person or their family.

Square planar molecular geometry

The square planar molecular geometry in chemistry describes the stereochemistry (spatial arrangement of atoms) that is adopted by certain chemical compounds. As the name suggests, molecules of this geometry have their atoms positioned at the corners of a square on the same plane about a central atom.
Relationship to other geometries.
Linear.
The addition of two ligands to linear compounds, ML2, can afford square planar complexes. For example, XeF2 adds fluorine to give square planar XeF4.
Tetrahedral molecular geometry.
In principle, square planar geometry can be achieved by flattening a tetrahedron. As such, the interconversion of tetrahedral and square planar geometries provides an intramolecular pathway for the isomerization of tetrahedral compounds. This pathway does not operate readily for hydrocarbons, but tetrahedral nickel(II) complexes, "e.g." NiBr2(PPh3)2, undergo this change reversibly.
Octahedral geometry.
Square planar geometry can also be achieved by the removal of a pair of ligands from the z-axis of an octahedron, leaving four ligands in the x-y plane. For transition metal compounds, the crystal field splitting diagram for square planar geometry can thus be derived from the octahedral diagram. The removal of the two ligands stabilizes the dz2 level, leaving the dx2-y2 level as the most destabilized. Consequently the dx2-y2 remains unoccupied in complexes of metals with the d8 configuration. These compounds typically have 16 valence electrons (eight from ligands, eight from the metal).
Examples.
Numerous compounds adopt this geometry, examples being especially numerous for transition metal complexes. The noble gas compound XeF4 adopts this structure as predicted by VSEPR theory. The geometry is prevalent for transition metal complexes with d8 configuration, which includes Rh(I), Ir(I), Pd(II), Pt(II), and Au(III). Notable examples include the anticancer drugs cisplatin [PtCl2(NH3)2] and carboplatin. Many homogeneous catalysts are square planar in their resting state, such as Wilkinson's catalyst and Crabtree's catalyst. Other examples include Vaska's complex and Zeise's salt. Certain ligands (such as porphyrins) stabilize this geometry.

Jaybird–Woodpecker War

The Jaybird–Woodpecker War (1888–89) was a feud between two United States Democratic Party factions fighting for political control of Fort Bend County, Texas in the southeast part of the state. The Woodpeckers (many of whom had been Republican during Reconstruction) included a number of whites and virtually the entire African-American population of the county. The Woodpeckers had controlled the county government by winning elections since the Reconstruction Era. The Jaybird faction, which included a majority of the white population in the county, wanted to oust blacks and their white allies from the county administration. Murders were committed against persons in each faction in 1888 and 1889. 
On August 16, 1889 a gunfight broke out at the county courthouse, in which four persons were killed including the sheriff. The Jaybirds won the fight and seized control of the county government soon afterward, with the collaboration of Governor Lawrence Sullivan Ross, who established martial law in the county. The effects of the Post-Reconstruction feud echoed in local politics for decades. The Jaybirds effectively disfranchised the African Americans in the county by using a "whites-only" ballot in preliminary party voting from 1889 until 1953, when the United States Supreme Court ruled that this was unconstitutional. 
Conflict.
The conflict allegedly derived its name from Bob Chapel, a local African-American man who was said to sing about jaybirds and woodpeckers. The Jaybirds were white Democrats opposed to the participation of blacks in local politics, as an alliance of blacks and whites (formerly Republican) had elected county officials for 20 years since Reconstruction. The Woodpeckers were nominally Democrats, too, with representatives elected largely by black voters. An election was held November 6, 1888, that was supervised by Texas Rangers. All of the Woodpecker candidates were elected or reelected (many had won election in 1884) to their slate of office. 
This engendered further hostilities from the Jaybirds. In the spring of 1889, Kyle Terry, then a Woodpecker official appointed as the tax assessor, murdered Ned Gibson, a leader of the Jaybirds. He had been on his way to testify in an unrelated cattle-rustling trial against a friend of Terry's being held in a neighboring town. Terry was arrested but posted bail and moved to Galveston, where he was gunned down by a group of Jaybirds in 1890.
Retaliatory murders occurred on both sides, including the 1889 killing of the local sheriff Tom Garvey (a Woodpecker). The violence culminated in the Battle of Richmond, the county seat, on August 16, 1889, when Sheriff Garvey, was killed. A total of seven people were killed in all these incidents. Following this, Governor Lawrence Sullivan Ross declared martial law and dispatched troops from the Houston Light Guards, along with more Texas Rangers. He arrived with the Brenham Light Guards to negotiate a settlement. As a result, the county government was reorganized under the control of the Jaybird faction. This was formalized through a meeting held on October 3, 1889, and the former officeholders were told to leave town.
Subsequently the Jaybirds held a meeting on October 22, 1889, creating the "Jaybird Democratic Organization of Fort Bend County". It dominated local politics for decades into the 1950s. The faction established a "white-only" preliminary ballot for county offices. This effectively disfranchised African Americans because the only competitive contest was that within the Democratic Party. A similar white primary measure was adopted by the state legislature in the early 20th century. The Jaybird Democrats retained control until their provision was overturned by a ruling by the United States Supreme Court in "Terry v. Adams", 345 U.S. 461 (1953).
By that time, two white primary processes authorized by the state government had been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court; the second was in "Smith v. Allwright" (1944).

Excalibur Rugby

Excalibur Rugby is the name of the men's rugby union team at Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario. The team's motto is "Commitment, Intensity, Desire" which is expressed in Latin on the team's crest.
History.
Formed in 1964, Excalibur Rugby has been able to maintain a strong tradition of competition and camaraderie. Originally founded by a small number of rugby enthusiasts, Excalibur Rugby expanded over the years to include both a first and second side, while competing as a varsity rugby team in the OUA[http://www.oua.ca/] and as a social club known as Trent Rugby Football Club (TRFC). Despite its strong history of development and maintenance of a second team composed of up and coming rookies, developing players and rugby fans, Excalibur Rugby made the move to carry only one team for the 2005 season.
Charitable involvement.
Over the years the members of Excalibur Rugby have been involved with a number of charitable organizations in and around Peterborough. Players from Excalibur Rugby have worked to support the Peterborough Regional Health Center, the United Way, Kawartha Food Share and other various charities such as the Terry Fox Foundation.
Tournaments and tours.
Each November Excalibur Rugby hosts an annual rugby union tournament known as the Bronze Touque tournament. Originally open to any team interested in competing which saw in its inaugural year teams from Ottawa University, Queens Law School and the Cobourg Saxons club team compete with Excalibur Rugby for the coveted trophy. By 2005 the Bronze Touque tournament has developed into a sanctioned OUA off season event with participation by various varsity teams.
Bi-annually members of Excalibur Rugby spend their spring reading break travelling to various schools across North America in a week long tour. In February 2005 Excalibur Rugby toured the Eastern United States playing Penn State and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Bhavani Mandap

Bhavani Mandap is a historical building situated in the walled city center of Kolhapur in southern Maharashtra, India. It is located near the famous and mammoth Mahalaxmi Temple on the west.
Religious significance.
Although smaller in size than Mahalaxmi temple, Bhavani Mandap holds equal importance to the citizens and pilgrims all over the country. It is the temple of goddess Tulja Bhavani (also known as Bhavani) who according to mythology is a guest in her elder sister Mahalaxmi's city Kolhapur.
Controversy.
There has been a long running controversy about the Bhavani idol worshipped at Bhavani Mandap. The Kolhapur front claims it to be the real statue of Bhavani that Shivaji Maharaj used to pray to and rescued from Tuljapur during a siege by Aurangzeb. The clergies from Tuljapur do not agree and maintain that their idol is genuine.
History.
Bhavani Mandap was an important meeting venue in yesteryears. It housed the offices of various court officials and was centre of many celebrations. It also saw a famous murder in the central courtyard. The place has the nostalgic charm and typical architecture of the British Raj bringing back memories of the rich princely state Kolhapur used to be.
Present Time.
At Bhavani Mandap, we can find the life size statue of Kolhapur's most loved prince Shahu Maharaj. Although, he was deemed king by the city dwellers, most of his political life was spent under the Raj. On display are stuffed animals actually hunted by Shri Shahu Maharaj including a giant bison (who has achieved some spiritual importance considering the amount of saffron spread over it), Panthers, a pair of deer and few others. It also exhibits a modest wooden throne believed to be the one used by Shivaji Maharaj on his visits to Kolhapur, strengthening the idea that He was more a man on a mission with not much regards to wordly comfort. In its present form it functions as a collective tomb of Kolhapur's Maratha royalty.
Myths.
It is said that there is an underground tunnel leading to Bhavani Mandap from Panhala, the hillside fort about 20 km away from Kolhapur built to allow an escape-route for warring Maratha soldiers. Any attempts to discover this tunnel or its discovery have not been heard.

Data Authentication Algorithm

The Data Authentication Algorithm (DAA) is a former U.S. government standard for producing cryptographic message authentication codes. According to the standard, a code produced by the DAA is called a Data Authentication Code (DAC). The algorithm is not considered secure by today's standards.
The algorithm chain encrypts the data, with the last cipher block truncated and used as the DAC.
The DAA is equivalent to ISO/IEC 9797-1 MAC algorithm 1, or CBC-MAC, with DES as the underlying cipher, truncated to between 24 and 56 bits (inclusive).

Education in the Maldives

Traditionally children aged three and up in the Maldives were educated in Islamic "Makthab" classes, generally using a single large room or the shelter of tree. The children learn simple arithmetic, Dhivehi and some Arabic, and practise reciting the Qur'an. These private schools still exist, but western-style schooling is becoming more pervasive.
The first western-style school in the Maldives is the Majeediyya School, a secondary established in 1927. The school was originally co-educational, but it was felt necessary to create a second school for girls (Aminiyya School) in 1944.
Based on a study by educational advisors from UNESCO, the Government of Maldives began implementation of the Educational Development Project on 6 October 1976. This Project constituted a comprehensive programme of educational development comprising Expansion of Primary Education, Teacher Training, Curriculum Development, Educational Radio, Community Education Programme for Adult Education and Textbook Development and Printing. The first School under this Project was opened in Baa Atoll Eydhafushi in March 1978 followed by another in HDh. Kulhudhuffushi in March 1979. Schools construction was continued in all atolls and was later complemented by Primary Schools construction project by Japan. Curriculum Development began in 1976, while Teacher Training began in 1977. Simultaneously other Programmes were introduced and continued through 1970s and until mid 1980s from where on the First Ten Year Master Plan for Educational (1986-1995) began implementation. Second Master Plan was implemented 1996-2005. These were the bases of educational development in the Maldives begun by the government of President Nasir continued by President Gayoom.
As of 2002, the President's Office claimed that universal primary education has almost been achieved and the literacy rate had improved from 70 percent in 1978 to 98.82 percent. In 2005, there were 106,220 students in schools, or 40% of the total population.
Higher education.
A National University Act was passed in January 2011 to establish the first university in the Maldives. Institutions offering higher education in the Maldives are:

Chingiz Abdullayev

Chingiz Akif oglu Abdullayev (; born April 7, 1959, Baku) is Azerbaijani writer, Secretary of the Union of Azerbaijani Writers.
Each book he writes now earns him more than $ 200,000 within two or three years.
Education.
Unlike many other Azerbaijani writers, who studied philology, Abdullayev has a Doctorate in Law from Baku State University (1991).
Soviet spy.
Abdullayev graduated from the faculty of law of Baku State University and began working for the Ministry of Defense of the USSR in 1981. He was wounded twice in the line of duty. Abdullayev was decorated by the Soviet government with the Order of the Red Banner, Order of the Red Star and medals. His decision to make writing a full-time career became clear to him after his friend, a fellow Soviet spy was double-crossed and killed by a shotgun blast to the back on an Angolan street in 1983.
Early career.
Abdullayev wrote his first novel in 1985. It was barred from publication because of the secrets it revealed, but by 1988 the Soviet censorship was relaxed, and his book was published. His writing became an almost overnight success and he quit the intelligence service a year later.
Popularity.
He is known mostly for his detective novels, which became extremely popular throughout the former Soviet Union and continue to attract readers not only in the CIS but also throughout the world.
Abdullayev has been published more than any other Azerbaijani writer. His books sold more than 20 million copies - mostly in the genre of detective novels and short stories in the Russian language.
He has authored more than 86 works, including novels and short stories, which have been published in 17 languages in 23 countries throughout the world. including the countries of the Former Soviet Union, France, Israel, Sweden, Norway, Turkey and Bulgaria.
His detective novels that are listed in The Golden Fund of World Detective Literature include: Blue Angels, The Law of Scoundrels, Better to Be Holy, The Shadow of Herod, and Three Colors of Blood.
Drongo.
Some of his characters, such as Drongo, have become so well known and beloved by the general public that they have become woven into legends and parodies. Most readers believe that the author described his adventures under this character. The name comes from a small but brave Asian bird drongo that shows no fear to larger birds
Coincidence about assassination attempt on Heidar Aliev.
In "Three Colors of Blood," Abdullayev wrote of an assassination attempt on Azerbaijan's former President Heidar Aliev. Two weeks after the book was published, assassins tried and failed to kill the president, leading some to question just how much Abdullayev had known of the plot. Abdullayev says it was merely coincidence, and counts Mr. Aliev among his loyal readers.
Philanthropy.
Chingiz Abdullayev refuses to earn any money from speeches or lectures in Azerbaijan, preferring instead to donate any money he could earn here to refugees who can't go home because of the Nagorno-Karabakh War.
Family.
Married, has one son and daughter.

Emotional contagion

Emotional contagion is the tendency for two individuals to emotionally converge. One view developed by Elaine Hatfield et al. is that this can be done through automatic mimicry and synchronization of one's expressions, vocalizations, postures and movements with those of another person. When people unconsciously mimic their companions' expressions of emotion, they come to feel reflections of those companions' emotions. Emotions can be shared across individuals in many different ways both implicitly or explicitly. For instance, conscious reasoning, analysis and imagination have all been found to contribute to the phenomenon. Emotional contagion is important to personal relationships because it fosters emotional synchrony between individuals.
A broader definition of the phenomenon was suggested by Schoenewolf: "a process in which a person or group influences the emotions or behavior of another person or group through the conscious or unconscious induction of emotion states and behavioral attitudes".
Etymology.
The phrase "emotional contagion" embodies the idea that humans will synchronize their personal emotions with the emotions expressed by those around them, whether consciously or unconsciously, and thus that an emotion conveyed by one person will become "contagious" to others. 
Psychologist Elaine Hatfield theorizes emotional contagion as a two-step process: Step 1: We imitate people; if someone smiles at you, you smile back. Step 2: Changes in mood through faking it. If you smile you feel happy, if you frown you feel bad. Mimicry seems to be one foundation of emotional movement between people. 
Emotional contagion and empathy have an interesting relationship, in that they share similar characteristics, with the exception of the ability to differentiate between personal and pre-personal experiences, a process known as individuation. In "The Art of Loving", social psychologist Erich Fromm explores these differences, suggesting that autonomy is necessary for empathy, which is not found in emotional contagion.
Influencing factors.
There are several factors that determine the rate and extent of emotional convergence in a group. Some of these are: membership stability, mood-regulation norms, task interdependence and social interdependence. Besides these event-structure properties, there are personal properties of the group's members, such as openness to receive and transmit feelings, demographic characteristics and dispositional affect that influence the intensity of emotional contagion.
Research.
Research regarding the concept of emotional contagion has been conducted from a variety of perspectives, including organizational, social, familial, developmental, and neurological contexts. While early research suggested that conscious reasoning, analysis, and imagination accounted for the idea of emotional contagion, it has been concluded that some forms of more primitive emotional contagion are far more subtle, automatic, and universal.
Psychologists Elaine Hatfield, John Cacioppo, and Richard Rapson have extensively researched emotional contagion and have found that people's conscious assessments of others' feelings were heavily influenced by what others said. People's own emotions, however, were more influenced by others' nonverbal cues as opposed to what they were really feeling. Recognizing emotions and acknowledging their origin can be one way to avoid emotional contagion. Transference of emotions has been studied in a variety of situations and settings, with social and physiological causes being two of the largest areas of research.
In addition to the social contexts discussed above, emotional contagion is a concept that has been studied within organizations. Schrock, Leaf, and Rohr (2008) discuss that organizations, like societies, have emotion cultures that consist of languages, rituals, and meaning systems, including rules about the feelings workers should, and should not, feel and display. They state that the concept of emotion culture is quite similar to the notion of "emotion climate" (p. 46), which has also been synonymously referred to as morale, organizational morale, and corporate morale. Furthermore, Worline, Wrzesniewski, and Rafaeli (2002) mention that organizations have an overall "emotional capability" (p. 318), while McColl-Kennedy and Smith (2006) examine the concept of "emotional contagion" (p. 255) specifically in customer interactions. These terms are arguably all attempting to describe a similar phenomenon; each term is different from one another in subtle and somewhat indistinguishable ways. Future research might consider where and how the meanings of these terms intersect, as well as how they differ.
A controversial experiment demonstrating emotional contagion using the social media platform Facebook was carried out in 2012 on 689,000 users by filtering positive or negative emotional content from their news feeds. The experiment sparked uproar among people who felt the study violated personal privacy.
Types.
Emotions can be shared and mimicked in many different ways. Early investigators of emotional contagion believed that "conscious reasoning, analysis and imagination accounted for this phenomenon." However, it is known now that some forms of emotional contagion are more subtle and automatic than early theorists suggested.
Implicit.
Unlike cognitive contagion, emotional contagion is less conscious and more automatic. It relies mainly on non-verbal communication, although it has been demonstrated that emotional contagion can, and does, occur via telecommunication. For example, people interacting through E-mails and "chats" are affected by the other's emotions, without being able to perceive the non-verbal cues.
One view, proposed by Hatfield and colleagues, describes the emotional contagion process as a primitive, automatic and unconscious behavior. According to this research group, it takes place through a series of steps. When a receiver is interacting with a sender, he perceives the emotional expressions of the sender. The receiver automatically mimics those emotional expressions. Through the process of afferent feedback, these new expressions are translated into feeling the emotions the sender feels, thus leading to emotional convergence. Another view, emanating from social comparison theories, sees emotional contagion as demanding more cognitive effort and being more conscious. According to this view, people engage in social comparison to see if their emotional reaction is congruent with the persons around them. In this case, the recipient uses the emotion as a type of social information to understand how he or she should be feeling.
People respond differentially to positive and negative stimuli, and negative events tend to elicit stronger and quicker emotional, behavioral, and cognitive responses than neutral or positive events. Thus, unpleasant emotions are more likely to lead to mood contagion than are pleasant emotions. Another variable that needs to be taken into account is the energy level at which the emotion is displayed. As higher energy draws more attention to it, the prediction is that the same emotional valence (pleasant or unpleasant) expressed with high energy will lead to more contagion than if expressed with low energy.
Explicit.
Contrary to the automatic infection of feelings described above, there are times when others' emotions are being manipulated by a person or a group in order to achieve something. This can be a result of intentional affective influence by a leader or team member. Suppose this person wants to convince the others of something, he may do so by sweeping them up in his enthusiasm. In such a case, his positive emotions are an act with the purpose of "contaminating" the others' feelings. A different kind of intentional mood contagion is by giving the group a reward, or treat, in order to alleviate their feelings.
In the organizational psychology literature, a growing body of research is dedicated to the aspects of emotional labor. In short, it deals with the need to manage emotions so that they are consistent with organizational or occupational display rules, regardless of whether they are discrepant with internal feelings. In regard to emotional contagion, in work settings that require a certain display of emotions, one finds himself obligated to display, and consequently feel, these emotions. In a process where surface acting develops into deep acting, emotional contagion is the byproduct of intentional affective impression management.
In workplaces and organizations.
Intragroup.
Many organizations and workplaces are currently encouraging team-work. This is a move driven by studies conducted by organizational psychologists that highlight the benefits of work-teams. Emotions come into play and a group emotion is formed.
The group's emotional state has an influence on factors such as cohesiveness, morale, rapport and the team's performance. For this reason, organizations need to take into account the factors that shape the emotional state of the work-teams, in order to harness the beneficial sides and avoid the detrimental sides of the group's emotion. Managers and team leaders should be even more cautious with their behavior, since their emotional influence is greater than that of a "regular" team member. It has been shown that leaders are more emotionally "contagious" than others.
Employee/customer.
The interaction between service employees and customers is considered an essential part of both customers' assessments of service quality and their relationship with the service provider. Positive affective displays in service interactions are positively associated with important customer outcomes, such as intention to return and to recommend the store to a friend. It is the interest of organizations that their customers be happy, since a happy customer is a satisfied one. Research has shown that the emotional state of the customer is directly influenced by the emotions displayed by the employee/service provider via emotional contagion. But, this influence is dependent on the degree of authenticity of the employee's emotional display, such that if the employee is only surface-acting, the contagion of the customer is poor, in which case the beneficial effects stated above will not occur.
Neurological bases.
Vittorio Gallese posits that mirror neurons are responsible for intentional attunement in relation to others. Gallese and colleagues at the University of Parma found a class of neurons in the premotor cortex that discharge when macaque monkeys execute goal-related hand movements or when they watch others doing the same action. One class of these neurons fires with action execution and observation, and with sound production of the same action. Research in humans shows an activation of the premotor cortex and parietal area of the brain for action perception and execution. Gallese continues his dialogue to say humans understand emotions through a simulated shared body state. The observers' neural activation enables a direct experiential understanding. "Unmediated resonance" is a similar theory by Goldman and Sripada (2004). Empathy can be a product of the functional mechanism in our brain that creates embodied simulation. The other we see or hear becomes the "other self" in our minds. Other researchers have shown that observing someone else's emotions recruits brain regions involved in (a) experiencing similar emotions and (b) producing similar facial expressions. This combination of activations indicates that the observer activates (a) a representation of the emotional feeling of the other individual which would lead to emotional contagion and (b) a motor representation of the observed facial expression that could lead to facial mimicry. In the brain, understanding and sharing other individuals' emotions would thus be a combination of emotional contagion and facial mimicry. Importantly, more empathic individuals experience more brain activation in emotional regions while witnessing the emotions of other individuals.
Amygdala.
The amygdala is one part of the brain mechanism that underlies empathy and allows for emotional attunement and creates the pathway for emotional contagion. The basal areas including the brain stem form a tight loop of biological connectedness, re-creating in one person the physiological state of the other. Psychologist Howard Friedman thinks this is why some people can move and inspire others. The use of facial expressions, voices, gestures and body movements transmit emotions to an audience from a speaker.

Longleat Safari Park

Longleat Safari and Adventure Park, in Wiltshire, England was opened in 1966 and was the first drive-through safari park outside Africa. The park is situated in the grounds of Longleat House, an English stately home that attracts tourists and is the current home of the 7th Marquess of Bath. The safari park was the first of its kind anywhere in the world and was considered to be a massive breakthrough in the way in which captive animals were kept, with the animals roaming freely and the visitors in cages (cars). Longleat Safari Park and the concept of safari parks were the brainchild of Jimmy Chipperfield (1912–1990), former co-director of Chipperfield's Circus.
Today Longleat's collection comprises over 500 animals, and the whole estate is situated on of Wiltshire countryside.
Other attractions.
The estate is open to the public with the various attractions being individually priced. A 'passport' ticket providing one admission to each attraction is available at a discount.
Jungle Cruise.
The Jungle Cruise involves taking a short trip around the park's lake, which houses a large family of sea lions, the dominant male of which is called Buster, and a pair of hippos. The central island is home to the parks only silverback gorilla, the legendary Nico. Aboard, it is possible for £1.00 to receive a cup of fish pieces to throw to the sea lions, who naturally follow the boat and bark for food.
Jungle Kingdom.
This attraction opened in 2011 and is the first step in a long redevelopment programme of the park as set out by new CEO David Bradley. The first section is within the former Pets Corner area, and includes walk-through exhibits for meerkats and chipmunks (the former is the first of its kind in the UK) along with themed enclosures for otters, binturong, coatis, porcupines, giant anteaters and mara.
The second section built between Jungle Kingdom and Animal Adventure includes the Monkey Temple which allows marmosets to run free around the visitors from mock temple ruins, and the lorikeet feeding station where visitors can buy pots of nectar to feed to Rainbow Lorikeets in a walk-through aviary. Otters and barn owls can also be found in this area.
Animal Adventure.
Containing many animals previously kept in Pets Corner, there are many exotic and familiar mammals, birds, reptiles and insects on display, including Macaws, Rabbits, Tortoises, Iguanas, Kune Kune Pigs, Armadillos, Siberian Weasels, Rock Hyrax and many more. A walk-through butterfly hot house and handling areas for small mammals, reptiles and invertebrates allow visitors to gain direct contact with the animals.
In the media.
Animal Park.
Longleat was the subject of BBC's long running Animal Park series, hosted by Kate Humble and Ben Fogle.
Roar.
Roar is about the animals and keepers at Wild Animal Parks. It is similar to anther BBC series, Animal Park, filmed at Longleat Safari Park. From series 6, it has moved from Howletts and Port Lympne to Longleat.
Andy's Wild Adventures.
The BBC’s Natural History Unit has started shooting a brand new Children’s TV series at Imagist Studios in Bristol called ” Andy’s Wild Adventures." Hosted by popular CBeebies presenter, Andy Day, the series is an exciting blend of natural history / entertainment for 4 -7-year olds. Andy is a busy ranger at Pickle’s Animal Park and every day after he’s finished his rounds he heads to his workshop for a tea break with his friend Kip the cat. There are certain things that Andy can’t show us in the Park, so he and Kip climb onboard their amazing Kip Mobile and head off on some incredible wild adventures, to see the animals for real.
The 40 x 15-minute episodes will utilise the extensive BBC Natural History archive with Andy filmed in front of Imagist Studio’s huge green screen. Andy will then be composited into each scene in post-production, so that it looks as if he really is coming face to face with wild animals in their natural habitats. From elephants in Africa, to penguins in Antarctica, And'ís adventures will be beyond even his wildest dreams. The production crew will be filming the exterior workshop and animal park scenes on location at Longleat Safari Park. The series first aired in January 2012 running for 40 episodes through the year.

<doc id="2845591" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2845591" title="Cation-exchange capacity">
Cation-exchange capacity

In soil science, cation-exchange capacity (CEC) is the maximum quantity of total cations, of any class, that a soil is capable of holding, at a given pH value, available for exchange with the soil solution. CEC is used as a measure of fertility, nutrient retention capacity, and the capacity to protect groundwater from cation contamination. It is expressed as milliequivalent of hydrogen per 100 g of dry soil(meq+/100g), or the SI unit centi-mol per kg (cmol+/kg). The numeric expression is coincident in both units.
Clay and humus have electrostatic surface charges that attract the solution ions, and hold them. This holding capacity varies for the different clay types and clay-blends present in soil, and is very dependent of the proportion of clay+humus that is present in a particular soil. One way to increase CEC is to favor the formation of humus. 
In general, the higher the CEC, the higher the soil fertility.
Calculation of CEC.
The CEC is the number of positive charges that a soil can contain. It is usually described as the amount of equivalents necessary to fill the soil capacity. In soil science, an equivalent is defined by the number of charges in terms of a given number of hydrogen ions. As hydrogen ions have only one positive charge (H+), this makes calculations relatively simple. An equivalent of Al3+ would have one third as many ions for the same amount of charges, and Ca2+ would have half as many ions. 
Translation from meq/100g to an every day unit, like lb/acre of available nutrients, can be made via calculation, that considers the atomic weight, the ion's valence, and by estimating the soil depth and its density. Mengel gives the following correspondence for 1 meq/100g:
Calcium, 400 lb/acre
Magnesium, 240 lb/acre
Potassium, 780 lb/acre
Ammonium, 360 lb/acre
Base saturation.
Closely related to cation-exchange capacity is the base saturation, which is the fraction of exchangeable cations that are base cations (Ca, Mg, K and Na). It can be expressed as a percentage, and called "percent base saturation". The higher the amount of exchangeable base cations, the more acidity can be neutralised in the short time perspective. Thus, a soil with high cation-exchange capacity takes longer time to acidify (as well as to recover from an acidified status) than a soil with a low cation-exchange capacity (assuming similar base saturations).
The base-cation saturation ratio (BCSR) is a method of interpreting soil test results that is widely used in sustainable agriculture, supported by the National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service (ATTRA) and claimed to be successfully in use on over a million acres (4,000 km²) of farmland worldwide.
pH and CEC.
Many soils' CEC is dependent upon the pH of the soil. This is due mostly to the lyotrophic series, which describes the relative strength of various cations' adsorption, and is generally as follows:
Al3+ > H+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ = NH4+ > Na+
As soil acidity increases (pH decreases), more H+ ions are attached to the colloids and push other cations from the colloids and into the soil solution (CEC decreases). Inversely, when soils become more basic (pH increases), the available cations in solution decreases because there are fewer H+ ions to push cations into the soil solution from the colloids (CEC increases).
Aluminium and CEC.
Many heavily weathered or oxidized soils, especially in the wet tropics, have a high concentration of Al+3. Since aluminium is toxic in high quantities for most plants, there are certain advantages and disadvantages to this. For one, due to the relatively high adsorption rate of aluminium to soil colloids, it is taken out of the soil and the plant cannot use it. On the other hand, because it has 3 positive charges, it takes up a large amount of charge in a CEC. For example, Al+3 fills the same space as three NH4+ ions. This makes many aluminium heavy soils relatively infertile. There is no easy way to remove Al ions from the soil colloid and free the CEC for other ions.
Organic matter.
Organic materials in soil increase the CEC through an increase in available negative charges. As such, organic matter build-up in soil usually positively impacts soil fertility. However, organic matter CEC is heavily impacted by soil acidity as acidity causes many organic compounds to release ions to the soil solution.
Anion exchange capacity.
Similar to the CEC, the anion exchange capacity is a measurement of the positive charges in soils affecting the amount of negative charges which a soil can adsorb. There are relatively few anions that are restrictive in agriculture, but they are important, such as sulfur or phosphorus. The anion lyotrophic series is: 
H2PO4- > SO4−2 > NO3- > Cl-
In contrast to CEC, AEC generally will increase when pH drops and decrease when pH rises.
Laboratory determination.
There are two standardised International Soil Reference and Information Centre methods for determining CEC: 
There exist slightly conflicting ideas on which mechanisms to include in the term, "cation exchange", in soil chemistry. From a theoretical point of view, one should distinguish cation exchange from ligand exchange, and exchange of diffuse layer adsorbed cations. On the other hand, from a practical point of view, e.g. in forest and agricultural management, what is important is the soils' ability to replace one cation with another rather than the exact mechanism by which this replacement occurs. What is included in the term, "cation exchange", in soil science thus varies with the scientific context.
Standard values.
These are the values reported by Carroll (1959) for the cation-exchange capacity of minerals in meq/100g at pH of 7.

Staple Inn

Staple Inn is a Tudor building on the south side of High Holborn street in the City of London, London, England. Located near Chancery Lane tube station, it is used as the London venue for meetings of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, is the last surviving Inn of Chancery and is also a listed building.
History.
It was originally attached to Gray's Inn, which is one of the four Inns of Court. The Inns of Chancery fell into decay in the 19th century. All of them were dissolved, and most were demolished. Staple Inn is the only one which survives largely intact. It was an extra-parochial area until 1858 and then a civil parish. It became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Holborn in 1900 and was abolished in 1930.
On 1 April 1994 boundary changes meant that the Inn was transferred from the London Borough of Camden to the City of London (and the City ward of Farringdon Without).
It was the model for the fictitious Inn of Court 
'Bacon's Inn' in Arthur Moore's 1904 novel 'Archers of the Long Bow'. The ancient switch-tailed double pump referred to was replaced in 1937 by a mock single pump, to mark the site. 
Wool staple.
Staple Inn dates from 1585. The building was once the wool staple, where wool was weighed and taxed. It survived the Great Fire of London, was extensively damaged by a Nazi German Luftwaffe aerial bomb in 1944 but was subsequently restored. It has a distinctive timber-framed façade, cruck roof and an internal courtyard. 
The historic interiors include a great hall, used by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. The ground floor street frontage is let to shops and restaurants, required to use plainer signage than they do on less sensitive buildings. This building will be familiar with those that smoke "Old Holborn" tobacco, as formerly it featured on tins and pouches of this product, this logo is no longer in use.

Leighton Park School

Leighton Park School is a co-educational Quaker independent school for both day and boarding pupils. It is situated in the town of Reading in Berkshire, in South East England. The school was founded in 1890, following the closure of Grove House School, also a Quaker establishment.
Overview.
The school is based in a parkland estate setting just south of the town centre of Reading, adjacent to the Whiteknights Park campus of the University of Reading. The school is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference. The school offers both the International Baccalaureate and traditional A Levels at Sixth Form.
In January 2013, Nigel Williams was appointed Head. Nigel has served over 18 years at the school in a variety of senior roles, including Head of House (Field), Assistant Head and Deputy Head. He took over from Alex McGrath who, prior to Leighton Park, was the former deputy head of Trent College.
The School House and Attached Laboratories at Leighton Park School are Grade II listed buildings.
History.
The teaching of young people has always been a priority for Quakers; from the late seventeenth century onwards, many were involved in establishing schools for their own children and others in need. In this light, Leighton Park was opened in 1890 by members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), as a public school for boys, with the specific aim of preparing academically able boys to enter university, to think for themselves and to develop self-reliance.
The school was founded after Grove House School, also a Quaker school, closed in 1877. Grove School had educated notable personalities such as Lord Lister, Alfred Waterhouse and Thomas Hodgkin.
Nicknamed 'the Quaker Eton', Leighton Park has sent a high proportion of its pupils to Oxford or Cambridge. To this day it retains academic prestige, being described as a school that possesses "outstanding teaching, facilities and excellent academic results give it the qualities that parents seek in a school" by ISBI schools.
Leighton Park grew from 4 boys in 1890 to 103 in the 1920s. By 1970 the school had 300 pupils, and in 1975 girls were admitted to the sixth form. In 1993 the school became fully coeducational. Today the school is home to 500 pupils drawn from over twenty different countries.
In 2006, 'Oakview', the new central-dining facility was introduced instead of traditional in-house dining. The facility was officially opened by Sir Steve Redgrave.
Traditions and routines.
Leighton Park, due to its Quaker faith, has marked customs and traditions which differ from those in Anglican schools. Some of these traditions are:
Houses.
There are five houses at Leighton Park: four senior and one junior. Each senior house has an average of 100 pupils, and the junior house has approximately 80 pupils. The first house established was named 'Grove', after Grove School, which Leighton Park has historical links with. The junior house, 'Fryer', houses pupils aged 11–13. All houses are mixed sex, and all have facilities for day and boarding pupils.
In early 2012, plans for a change to the house structure were considered and approved by Governors and the Senior Management Team. On announcement to the school and Old Leightonians it received concern and has since been suspended. Any future proposed changes will be subject to wide consultation.
Sport.
The school has a floodlit astroturf sports pitch and 22 tennis courts, along with four main sports fields. The school's sporting strengths lie in athletics, cricket, rugby, hockey and netball. Many other sports are catered for including football, tennis and swimming. The school awards scholarships for talented and capable sportsmen and women.
The school hosts an annual cross-country competition: the race is over 2.5 km long. There is also a house 'Road Relay' race where 12 pupils, teams of four from each senior house, race to complete one lap of the kilometre-long road track. The results of the road relay count towards the annual House Cup, awarded at the end of each academic year. There are also other regular house sport competitions: rugby, football, athletics, hockey, tennis and swimming.
Leightonian Funto Fabunmi-Alade was English Schools Athletics sprint champion in her age group for several consecutive years. In April 2011, student Charlotte Turner qualified for the UK National County Cross-Country Championships while in Year 10.
The school recently hosted a Super Six Rugby Sevens Tournament, a spin-off of the 'Super Six' rugby XV cup competition that the school founded and takes part in with five other schools. It has won the cup on several occasions. The school also participates in the Daily Mail Cup rugby competition.
Music and drama.
Music.
The current Head of Music is Rosemary Scales. At Leighton Park many instruments are taught, with opportunities being given to all students should they wish to learn. The school also has a fully equipped specialist recording studio. Leighton Park gives scholarships for dedicated and talented musicians.
Leighton Park is known for its annual House Music competition. The competition involves many students - from House 'Big Group' (where pop songs such as Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' and Shania Twain's 'Man! I feel like a woman!' have been performed), to solo artists (Old Leightonian Laura Marling competed live in 2007, but lost out in her category of "Original Song"). The house music competition's final standings award points to Houses, which go towards the annual House Cup.
The school offers Music GCSE and A-Level, as well as Music Technology.
Drama.
The Drama department is headed by Geraint Thomas, and supplemented by several other teachers. Leighton Park's Main Hall theatre is the home of school productions. It is also often hired by local choral and drama companies. There is usually one main School production per academic year, alternating between a musical and a play. The production usually takes place in the Spring Term and has a high reputation: it is normally fully booked every night.
In the past, the school has put on Our Country's Good, Evita, The Crucible, West Side Story, "Grease" and "Much Ado About Nothing", as well as several other well known dramatic pieces. In the 2012-13 academic year the production was Miss Saigon, which featured a full-size helicopter on stage.
Younger students at Leighton Park have the opportunity to perform in the "Fryer Festival" in the summer.
The school offers GCSE Drama as well as A-level Theatre Studies.
Press.
Leighton Park has featured in the press most recently in light of the BBC Politics Show, which was hosted at Leighton Park in December 2010.
In April 2005, Quaker-based Sunday Worship was broadcast live from Leighton Park on BBC Radio 4. Heard by an estimated 1.75 million listeners, the sequence of readings, music, ministry and silence "reflected the essence of Quaker values to the wider world."
Leighton Park also featured in the press in 2005 for the introduction of a music workshop by ex-child soldier turned musician, Ben Okafor.
The school is mentioned in the play and film, "The History Boys", by Alan Bennett. The headmaster mentions schools he would like to emulate regarding high pupil entry to Oxford; among them is Leighton Park — 'or is that an open prison?', he adds.

Mitchell, Queensland

Mitchell is a town in the Western Downs district of Maranoa Region, Queensland, Australia. It is on the Warrego Highway, west of Brisbane and east of Charleville. At the 2006 census, Mitchell had a population of 944.
The Warrego Highway passes through town to form the main street, Cambridge Street. The Maranoa River flows around the northern and eastern sides of the town before eventually flowing into the Balonne River.
The town services the local area, a cattle and sheep farming district.
History.
Before the arrival of Europeans, the Maranoa region was occupied by the Mandandanji and Gunggari Aboriginal peoples. Based on archeological excavations in the Mount Moffatt area, it has been deduced that the Aboriginals had lived there for around 19,500 years. Descendants of the original peoples still live in and visit the area today.
The town is named after Sir Thomas Mitchell explorer and Surveyor General of New South Wales, who explored the area in 1846. In 1854, Edmund Morey established the property of "Mitchell Downs". When the original homestead was largely destroyed by a flood in 1864, Thomas Close acquired the building's ruins established the "Maranoa Hotel". On 1 January 1865, Mitchell Downs Post Office opened and around 1878 was renamed Mitchell Post Office. 
In 1902, after a short stand-off, bushrangers Patrick and James Kenniff were captured south of Mitchell at a location now known as arrest creek. Patrick was hanged in 1903 for the murder of Constable George Doyle and Albert Dahlke, while James was released after 12 years imprisonment and died peacefully in 1940.
Mitchell was once the administrative centre of the Shire of Booringa local government area. The town is now part of the Maranoa Region.
Facilities.
Mitchell has a public library, heritage museum and the Maranoa art gallery. 
Heritage listings.
Mitchell has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
Climate.
Mitchell has a humid subtropical climate with hot summers and cool to cold winters. On the 15 August 1979 Mitchell recorded a minimum temperature of -9.4 °C (15.0 °F), which is the 3rd coldest temperature ever recorded in Queensland.
Floods.
In the March 2010 floods, the Maranoa River reached a peak of 13.4 m in the town causing an inundation of 25 houses.
The town experienced the worst flooding ever in 2012 when a monsoon trough hovered over central and southern Queensland.
Great Artesian Spa.
The Great Artesian Spa was opened in 1998 and is situated in the town’s aquatic centre.
There are two pools of artesian water, one heated and the other designed for those who prefer a cooler experience. Both spa pools have been designed with disabled access in mind and facilities include a chairlift to allow easy access for physically disabled people.
The water used in the spa pools is renewed regularly and comes from the Great Artesian Basin, which is one of the largest artesian basins in the world, which underlies around one-fifth of Australia. It covers a total area of more than 1,711,000 square kilometres, and has been relied upon for the town water supply since 1927.
Notable people.
The 15th Prime Minister of Australia, Francis Forde was born in Mitchell. He is Australia's shortest serving Prime Minister, with a term lasting just eight days. He was also Australia's longest living Prime Minister, until surpassed by Gough Whitlam on 21 January 2009.
Water supply.
The water supply for the town comes from three bores. The depth of the bores is about 1,000 metres. The water is pumped into a large concrete water tower on the western side of the town. The water is hot when it emerges from the ground, and in the tank it is about 50°C. Houses close to the tank, have free hot water. In fact it is necessary to cool the water before it can be used.

Life's a Riot with Spy vs Spy

"Life's a Riot with Spy Vs Spy" is Billy Bragg's first studio album, released in 1983.
The original album played at 45 rpm rather than the more usual 33.3 rpm, contained only seven songs and lasted for only 15 minutes and 57 seconds. However, rather than being classified as an EP, it qualified for the UK albums chart and reached number 30 in January 1984.
The album contains both politically charged songs, such as the attack on the school system and unemployment, "To Have and To Have Not," and love songs such as "The Milkman of Human Kindness" and "A New England" (which was later a hit for singer Kirsty MacColl.)
Versions.
The album was originally released by Charisma Records in May 1983. The cassette version of the album was recorded on only one side of the tape; the second side of the tape was blank, inscribed with a message that fans should use it to bootleg his concerts. The album was then reissued in November 1983 on Go! Discs. In 1986 the tracks from the album along with the tracks from "Brewing Up with Billy Bragg" (1984) and the tracks from the "Between the Wars" EP (1985) were issued on an compilation album called "Back to Basics" by Go! Discs. This compilation was reissued by Cooking Vinyl in 1996. Cooking Vinyl released another compilation album in 1996 combining the tracks from the album with the four tracks from the "Between the Wars" EP and titled "Life's a Riot Between the Wars".[http://www.billybragg.co.uk/releases/albums/index.html]
In 2006 as part of a series of reissues of albums from his back catalogue, the album was reissued as "Life's a Riot with Spy Vs Spy", with the original tracks on one disc along with a bonus CD of alternate versions and previously unreleased material. The tracks on the bonus CD were produced and compiled by Grant Showbiz.
In October 2013, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the original release, a new version was released. This featured a remastered version of the original tracks alongside a live performance of the entire EP which was recorded live at the Union Chapel, London on 5 June 2013.

<doc id="2845655" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2845655" title="Daily Post (Fiji)">
Daily Post (Fiji)

The Fiji's Daily Post is a newspaper that was formed by Wame Waqanisanini JR in Oct 1987, who owned 50 percent of the shares. Taniela Bolea was the original publisher. The majority shares were later owned by the Fijian government. The newspaper suspended publication and has remain closed since 2010.
The first Daily Post (Volume 1, No. 1) appeared as a 24-page tabloid with a red masthead, Saturday, 23 September 1989. The cover story, headlined ‘Fiji Now Drugs Transit Point’, was by Karalaini Naciqa. That first edition contained court reports, special reports, an editorial, a feature on the Consumer Council, a children’s page, a page of international news, and a back page devoted to sport. 
The second edition of the FDP appeared Monday (25 September 1989, Volume 1, No.2) and carried the newspaper’s first ‘Letters to the Editor’. The newspaper listed Kameli Rakoko as ‘Sports Editor’ and Robert Wendt (now deceased) was named as ‘Chief Sub-Editor’. In its first year, the newspaper served as an incubator for new journalists as well as a refuge for disaffected others. Stories and articles appeared by Mark Langan (former managing editor of the Samoa Daily News), Percy Kean, Filimoni Verebalavu, Kini Nalatu, Hari Gounder, and Kamal Iyer. 
In 1990 the FDP management was listed as Publisher, Taniela Bolea; Editor, Isimeli Koroi; Western Manager, Hari Gaunder; Accountant, Ashok Kumar; Advertising Manager, Simione Celua; Circulation Manager, John Singh; and Production Manager, Mohammad Ali. 
Four years into its operation, the FDP was, at the end of 1993, publishing editions of 40 to 68 pages varying according to daily demand and advertising. The publisher was still Taniela Bolea, but the Editor was Nemani Delaibatiki (replacing Isimeli Koroi). Ravin Lal had taken over as Advertising Manager (from Simione Celua), the Production manager was Aisea Itautoka (replacing Mohammed Ali), and Circulation was in the hands of Vishwa Nand (in place of John Singh). 
By 1994, Distribution was under Timoci Rabo; Systems Manager was John Mansell; and the Suva office under Elenoa Lagataki. `Sidetracks’ with the late (and great) Robert Keith-Reid was a popular column at that time. Cartoons were occasional with ‘Mafi’s World’ the feature.
By 1997 Laisa Taga was Managing Editor (replacing Floyd Takeuchi and Nemani Delaibatiki), Greg Pooran had become Acting Advertising Manager and a new position of Marketing Manager was held by Andrew Joseph. Another new position of Financial Controller was held by Anura Bandara. 
In 1999, Jim Ah Koy, Finance Minister at the time, persuaded the SVT government to purchase a majority holding in the newspaper to assist government in public dissemination and explanation of its legislation and policies. 
Despite government support, by 2000, the FDP was losing ground to newcomer, the ‘Fiji Sun’. A new management group was thereby brought in to run the ailing newspaper. In 2005 the measures undertaken by that management group became the subject of Court action and criminal investigation brought on by the FDP's new Australian owner-publisher, Alan Hickling. Hickling had successfully bought a portion of both government and small share-holders' shares to acquire the newspaper. 
The government has since retained its reduced percentage of the FDP shares, while Alan Hickling has increased his percentage shares giving him the controlling interest.
During its time, the FDP has been located at several addresses. It began as an office in Three Miles, Nabua (corner of Fletcher Road and Ratu Mara Road), before moving to Valelevu, Nasinu. The administration, editorial and advertising departments then split off and moved to Toorak (Toorak Road), Suva, leaving the press and production at Valelevu. The admin-ed-adv departments then moved downtown to Greig Street, Suva, before moving finally to Ackland Street, Vatuwaqa.
The FDP has also been responsible for publishing several ethnic newspapers each with its own editorial staff under the supervision and control of the English-language newspaper. The ethnic Fijian (now known as 'itaukei') language newspaper called 'Volasiga' began under Samisoni Bolatacigi almost simultaneously with the inception of the FDP. In the mid-1990s, an ethnic Rotuman-language newspaper, 'No'ia Rotuma', commenced under the editorial direction of Aisea Eiali. At this time, an ethnic Indian Hindi-language newspaper 'Ramnik Joyati' also commenced under the FDP flagship. In the early 2000s, two ethnic Chinese-language newspapers were also published by the FDP. These were the 'Chinese Mail' and the 'Chinese Post' - each taking a different perspective of China's role in the world.
The FDP suffered criticism from its commencement in 1989 to its closure in 2010 that it represented an extreme ethnic Fijian/itaukei viewpoint in Fiji's national discourse. The evidence for this conclusion is inconclusive. No other newspaper in Fiji has attempted to reach as wide a multicultural cross-section of the people as the FDP through the provision of five separate language publications. The staff of the newspaper has always been multi-ethnic in complexion, representative of a wide range of religious and political viewpoints, and of both genders. As far as ideological orientation of the editorial staff is concerned, it is fair to suppose that once the Fiji government took an official role as major share-holder in the newspaper (late 1990s), the FDP was obliged to tow the government line, but again, this is an oversimplification of the facts. Content analysis of the FDP in comparison with Fiji's other major dailies, the Fiji Times and Fiji Sun does not bear this out. 
2006 coup d'état.
On Saturday, 2 December, 2006 the FDP published what was alleged to be the military's timetable for taking control of the Qarase-led SDL government. The newspaper also reported that day that the incumbent Prime Minister, Laisenia Qarase, would be removed from power on 4 December (2006). Both reports were wrong, but warnings and intimidation from unknown persons led to concerns about the safety of staff and the FDP premises were evacuated at 3.30 pm, on 4 December and remained closed for a period of 24 hours. A further threat prevented the FDP from publishing on 5 December 2006, but it was the only newspaper to publish on the day after the coup (6 December).
On 8 December 2006, FDP General Manager, Mesake Koroi, was detained and questioned by soldiers at Suva's Queen Elizabeth Barracks(source). Two days later, Koroi left for his village of Mavana on the Lau island of Vanua Balavu where he remained for three months. The newspaper continued to publish under Editor-in-Chief, Dr Robert Wolfgramm, News Editor, Mithleshni Gurdayal, and Legal Officer, Api Mataitoga. 
On 14 December 2006, Wolfgramm and Mataitoga were also taken to the military camp and detained for questioning whereupon Wolfgramm had his passport confiscated and was informed of his deportation to Australia. Wolfgramm's deportation was not followed through and his passport was returned to him through the Office of the Fiji Human Rights Commission on 5 January 2007. The FDP had been refusing to accept Military interference in its publications in the wake of the military coup which deposed the Qarase-led SDL government on 5 December 2006. In the two years leading to the coup, dozens of FDP editorials were critical of the military leadership's position on the twice-elected government of deposed Prime Minister, Laisenia Qarase. 
On 17 October 2008, the FDP published a letter-to-the-editor that was deemed to be in contempt of court by the Attorney-General. The letter was similar to that which was later published in the Fiji Times and for which the publishers and editors of both newspapers were charged and legal proceedings begun. The FDP case has not been resolved.
Following the imposition of Fiji Public Emergency Regulations on 10 April 2009, censors were allocated to the newsrooms of all of Fiji's media including the FDP. Protests by various media against this measure initially took the forms of either black ink, blank spaces, or blurb. Eventually, the FDP negotiated a working relationship with this difficulty. 
In February 2010, suffering the combined effects of falling staff morale, shrinking circulation, censorship demands, and weighty unresolved court cases, the FDP suspended publication and closed.

Acetohexamide

Acetohexamide (trade name Dymelor) is a first-generation sulfonylurea medication used to treat diabetes mellitus type 2, particularly in people whose diabetes cannot be controlled by diet alone.
Mechanism of action.
Acetohexamide lowers blood sugar by stimulating the pancreas to secrete insulin and helping the body use insulin efficiently. The pancreas must produce insulin for this medication to work. For this reason, acetohexamide is not used to treat diabetes mellitus type 1.
metabolic reduction of acetohexamide into the active hypoglycemic metabolite S-(-)-hydroxyhexamide is carried out by cytochromes
Risks.
Oral hypoglycemic drugs, including acetohexamide, have been associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. Talk to your doctor about the possible risks, benefits, and alternatives of using this drug for your condition.

2005 International Rules Series

The 2005 International Rules series was the 12th annual International Rules Series and the 14th time that a test series of International rules football was played between Ireland and Australia and was won by Australia.
The 2005 series involved two test matches in Australia, the first in Perth (which was a sell-out) and a second test in Melbourne which was controversial due to the on field actions of the Australian team.
Previous Series.
Starting with the first official senior-level International Rules series was played between players from the Australian rules football leagues and the Gaelic Athletic Association in 1984, the Irish had won 7 of the previous series to Australia's 6. Coming into the series, the Irish held the Cormac McAnallen Cup after their 2004 whitewash of the Australians at Croke Park in Dublin. 
2005 Series.
The Melbourne test was played at the Telstra Dome rather than the Melbourne Cricket Ground, unlike previous series in Australia, since the MCG was preparing to host the 2006 Commonwealth Games. By 1 August 2005, a vast majority of the tickets for the Perth test had been sold. When the matches were last played in Australia in 2003, over 100,000 people attended the two tests in Perth and Melbourne, underscoring the popularity of the series with Australian football fans.
The Ireland team was managed by former County Down manager Pete McGrath, an All Ireland winning manager, while the AFL appointed long-serving Essendon coach Kevin Sheedy as its new head coach, to replace Garry Lyon, who had been in charge of the Australians from 2001 to 2004. 
The Irish suffered a blow to their attempt to retain the cup when Sydney Swans backfielder and team mainstay Tadhg Kennelly (originally from County Kerry) was forced to make himself unable for selection due to a nagging ankle injury that he was playing through during the Swans' run to the AFL premiership. In a departure from previous years, the Australians selected a team specifically for these games, rather than giving automatic selection to members of the All Australian Team. Another Irishman who has played in the AFL, Jim Stynes, assisted with selection and planning, giving insight into the Irish game as he has in previous years.
The series was comprehensively won by the Australians. In the first test, they outplayed the Irish in all aspects of the game, including speed and kicking the round ball, which are traditionally strengths of the Irish players. Kicking 2 goals and 27 overs, Australia became the first team to score 100 points in an International Rules test. Australian umpire Mathew James atrracted some criticism from the Irish press for applying the 20 metre penalty rule more strictly than expected by the Irish.
The Irish team was more competitive in the second test, in which there were several brawls and Australian captain Chris Johnson was sent off. However, they still lost by 21 points, meaning that Australia won the series on aggregate by 57 points.
Squads.
1 – Australia named McLeod and Johnson as co-captains for the side.<br>
² – Withdrawal replacement for Essendon's Matthew Lloyd.<br>
³ – Officially ruled out for the first Test.

<doc id="2845688" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2845688" title="Lega Nord Toscana">
Lega Nord Toscana

Lega Nord Toscana (North League Tuscany, LNT) is a regionalist political party in Tuscany, Italy. Founded in 1987, it has functioned as the "national" (hence, regional) section of Lega Nord in the region. Its current leader is Manuel Vescovi.
History.
The party was founded in 1987 as the Movement for Tuscany ("Movimento per la Toscana", MpT). In 1988, under the leadership of Tommaso Fragassi, the party changed name to Tuscan Alliance ("Alleanza Toscana", AT).
AT participated to the 1989 European Parliament election as part of the coalition Lega Lombarda – Alleanza Nord. In 1989–1990 it took part in the process of federating the Northern regionalist parties, ahead of the regional elections. In February 1991 it merged into Lega Nord (LN), taking the current name, and since then it is the regional section of that party in Tuscany.
In the 1992 and 1994 general election Riccardo Fragassi was elected to the Chamber of Deputies (in 1992 along with Gianmarco Mancini), while his father Tommaso resigned from secretary because he rejected the alliance between LN and the centre-right Pole of Freedoms. In 1995, when the alliance was dissolved, R. Fragassi left the party in opposition to that break-up and formed the Tuscan Federalist Alliance instead. He would return into the fold ten years later.
The party's new secretary, Simone Gnaga, was elected to the Chamber in the 1996 general election. He would too leave in 1998 in order to join National Alliance. Between 1998 and 2006 the party was led by Vincenzo Soldati, a member of the party's libertarian wing. The party was then led by federal commissioner Luca Rodolfo Paolini, national secretary of Lega Nord Marche, from 2006 to 2008, when Claudio Morganti was elected national secretary. In the 2008 general election the party elected a deputy, Paolini himself, after almost ten years of no representation in the Italian Parliament. In the 2009 European Parliament election Morganti was elected MEP. In the 2010 regional election the party won 6.5% of the vote, its best result ever, and entered the Regional Council for the first time, with four councillors.
Despite these electoral results, Morganti's leadership was openly contested by many party members. In April 2011 Dario Locci, a regional councillor, left in protest. In September 2011 Morganti resigned from secretary and was replaced by federal commissioner Giovanni Fava. The move was not enough for Locci, who made no return, and another group of disgruntled members, including regional councillor Marina Staccioli, who left the party to form Tuscan Identity in December. In October 2012 the two remaining regional councillors of the party, Antonio Gambetta Vianna and Gian Luca Lazzeri, responded to the emphasis posed by the new federal secretary Roberto Maroni on the North and the establishment of a Padanian euroregion by changing the denomination of their group from "Lega Nord Toscana" to "More Tuscany". Vianna and Lazzeri were soon expelled from the party, which was left without regional councillors. In April 2013 also Morganti was expelled from the party. These internal clashes resulted in a dismal result in the 2013 general election, during which LNT garnered a mere 0.7% of the vote.
In April 2013 the national congress of the party elected Manuel Vescovi as its new national secretary.
Popular support.
Lega Nord is not particularly strong in Tuscany, but in the 2010 regional election it gained its best result ever (6.5%). The party was particularly strong, by Tuscan standards, in the provinces of Prato (9.8%), Lucca (8.5%), Arezzo (8.3%), Pistoia (7.4%) and Massa-Carrara (6.7%), while being weaker in the province of Florence (5.1%) and in the coastal and southern parts of the region.
The electoral results of Lega Nord Toscana in the Region are shown in the table below.

Carlo Felice Trossi

Count Carlo Felice Trossi (27 April 1908 – 9 May 1949) was an Italian racecar driver and auto constructor. 
Racing career.
During his career, he raced for three teams: Mercedes-Benz, Alfa Romeo and, briefly, Maserati. He won the 1947 Italian Grand Prix and the 1948 Swiss Grand Prix. 
Trossi backed one of the most unusual Grand Prix cars, the Trossi-Monaco of 1935. This car featured a 16-cylinder, two-stroke cycle, two-row radial, air-cooled engine and an aircraft-like body designed by Augusto Monaco. The car was a spectacular failure and never raced in a Grand Prix event.
He had many exciting hobbies: racing boats and airplanes in addition to cars. Count Felice Trossi was also the president of the Scuderia Ferrari in 1932. Enzo Ferrari said of him "He was a great racer but never wanted to make the effort to reach a dominant position" and I remember him with emotion since he was one of the first to believe in my scuderia of which he was a part". [ ref. Piloti Che Gente, Enzo Ferrari, 1893].
Personal life.
Trossi was born in Biella, Italy. Due to a brain tumor, he died in Milan at only 41 years of age.

Somethin' Stupid

"Somethin' Stupid" is a song written by C. Carson Parks and originally recorded in 1966 by Parks and his wife Gaile Foote, as "Carson and Gaile". It is best known in the hit version by Frank Sinatra and his daughter, Nancy Sinatra.
Original recording by Carson and Gaile.
In the early 1960s, Carson Parks was a folk singer in Los Angeles. He was an occasional member of The Easy Riders, and also performed with The Steeltown Three, which included his younger brother Van Dyke Parks. In 1963 he formed the Greenwood County Singers, later known as The Greenwoods, who had two minor hits and included singer Gaile Foote. Before the Greenwoods disbanded, Parks and Foote married and, as Carson and Gaile, recorded an album for Kapp Records, "San Antonio Rose", which included the track "Something Stupid". The recording was then brought to the attention of Frank Sinatra.
Frank and Nancy Sinatra.
The most successful and best-known version of the song was issued as a single by Nancy Sinatra and Frank Sinatra and subsequently appeared on Frank's album "The World We Knew". Frank had played Parks' recording to his daughter's producer, Lee Hazlewood, who recalled ""He asked me, 'Do you like it?' and I said, 'I love it, and if you don't sing it with Nancy, I will.' He said, 'We're gonna do it, book a studio.'"" Their rendition was recorded on February 1, 1967. Al Casey played guitar on the recording. Hazlewood and Jimmy Bowen were listed as the producers of the single, with arrangement by Billy Strange.
The single spent four weeks at #1 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart and nine weeks atop the easy listening (now adult contemporary) chart, becoming Frank's second gold single as certified by the RIAA and Nancy's third. It was the first and only instance of a father-daughter number-one song in America. Nancy Sinatra has said she thinks it's "very sweet" that some people refer to it as the "Incest Song". The single also reached #1 on the UK Singles Chart the same year.
Robbie Williams and Nicole Kidman version.
British singer Robbie Williams recorded "Somethin' Stupid" as a duet in 2001 with Academy Award-winning actress Nicole Kidman. The song appeared on Williams' 2001 album, "Swing When You're Winning", and it topped the UK Singles Chart at the end of the year. The song became Williams' first Christmas number-one single in the United Kingdom, and fifth as a featured artist. The single sold 98,506 copies in its first week and 366,000 copies over all earning a Silver Certification by the BPI. It was also listened when Esther sang to it on "Esther Barbero Comes To Town" the 2nd season finale "The three musketeers".
The song was the 30th best selling single of 2001 in the UK. The song also became another number-one single for Williams in New Zealand, being certified Gold, and became, at the time, his best selling single in Europe charting inside the top ten in most countries. In Australia, it became Williams' fourth top ten single, earning a Gold certification for over 35,000 copies sold. These are the formats and track listings of major single releases of "Somethin' Stupid".

Tism.bestoff.

tism.bestoff. is a 2002 "best of" compilation CD by the Australian band TISM. It is also known as best off, tism. best off. or by its full title tism. best off. retrospective works 86/02.
The disc is a collection of TISM favorites from throughout their career and a few rare tracks which have become live fan favorites, such as "Death, Death, Death". Also on the disc are the unreleased tracks "Sid Viscous" and "The Phillip Ruddock Blues" (recorded in the "De Rigueurmortis" sessions) as well as a remix of "Defecate On My Face" by the Australian band Machine Gun Fellatio.
"This Is Serious Mum: A Collection of Bedroom Recordings 1982-1992".
Original pressings of the disc came with a bonus CD titled This is Serious Mum which was, as the title indicated, a collection of bedroom recordings 1982 - 1992. This disc appeals to the hardcore TISM fan because every track on it has been in TISM's possession only and never before available, save for a few heavily edited tracks which appeared on "Great Truckin' Songs of the Renaissance" (1988). Other notable appearances on this disc are two early versions of songs, which gives fans a brief look at how TISM worked with songs in the studio. "I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Whittle Away My Furniture" is noticeably slower than its release on Hot Dogma (1990) and "You're Only As Good As Your Fans" is a completely different style to the version renamed "Play Mistral For Me" which was released on "Machiavelli and the Four Seasons" (1995).

Marlborough Township, Ontario

Marlborough Township is a historical township in eastern Ontario, Canada.
Marlborough was located in the southern part of Carleton County. It was bounded to the south by Oxford Township, to the southwest by Montague Township, to the northwest by Goulbourn Township and to the northeast by North Gower Township. The Rideau River runs along the border with Oxford Township.
It was established in 1791. In 1800, it became part of Carleton County and was incorporated as a township in 1850. The first family to settle in this area was that of Stephen Burritt, a United Empire Loyalist, in 1793. The township merged with North Gower Township in 1974 to become Rideau Township. Rideau, in turn, became part of the amalgamated city of Ottawa in 2001.
Marlborough Township took its name from John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough.
According to the Canada 2011 Census, the Township had a population of 2,343.

Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity

The Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity ("Partito Socialista Italiano di Unità Proletaria", PSIUP), was a political party in Italy from 1964 to 1972.
History.
The PSIUP was formed on 12 January 1964 by a leftist section of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). PSIUP had been the PSI's name in 1943-1947. The new PSIUP was led by Tullio Vecchietti. Other leading members were Lelio Basso, Vittorio Foa, Lucio Libertini, Emilio Lussu, Francesco Cacciatore detto Cecchino and Dario Valori.
The new party attracted PSI militants who were dissatisfied with the close cooperation between the PSI and the Christian Democracy. Instead the founders of the PSIUP favoured cooperation with the Italian Communist Party (PCI).
On 13 July 1972, following a disappointing electoral result, the PSIUP split. The majority, led by Libertini, Valori and Vecchietti, joined the PCI. The rightist minority, led by Giuseppe Avolio, Nicola Corretto and Vincenzo Gatto, rejoined the PSI. The leftist minority, led by Foa and Silvano Miniati, continues to work under the name PSIUP, and in December 1972 they established the Proletarian Unity Party (PdUP).
A Posadist faction within the PSIUP published the "Bollettino della sinistra rivoluzionaria del PSIUP" between 1965 and 1967.

South Capitol Street

South Capitol Street is a major street dividing the southeast and southwest quadrants of Washington, D.C., in the United States. It runs south from the United States Capitol to the D.C.-Maryland line, intersecting with Southern Avenue. After it enters Maryland, the street becomes Indian Head Highway (Maryland Route 210) at the Eastover Shopping Center, a terminal or transfer point of many bus routes.
History.
South Capitol Street from the United States Capitol to the Anacostia River was part of the L'Enfant Plan of streets for the District of Columbia. The Residence Act of 1790 gave President George Washington the authority to select the location for the national capitol, and the area comprising the District of Columbia was chosen in late 1790. A surveying commission was chosen in January 1791, and in August 1791 Pierre Charles L'Enfant had delivered his plan for the city to Washington. Construction of the segment of South Capitol Street from the Capitol to the Anacostia River occurred over the decade, as the roadway was surveyed, trees were felled, brush and stumps removed, a roadway graded, and the street later paved with a variety of surfaces (wood blocks, granite blocks, oiled earth, aggregate, and macadam).
The area east of the Anacostia River remained mostly farms and forest with few roads. The area was served primarily by the Navy Yard Bridge, constructed in 1820. The first residential development in the area was Uniontown (now the neighborhood of Anacostia), begun in 1854. The following year, the federal government constructed the Government Hospital for the Insane (later known as St. Elizabeths Hospital). To serve the hospital, Asylum Avenue was constructed from the Navy Yard Bridge to the new hospital and then, running on the east side of a line of hills, down to the District-Maryland line. Additional construction in the area occurred during the American Civil War (1861-1865). The United States Department of War constructed the George Washington Young cavalry magazine on of land on Giesborough Point. Two forts, Fort Carroll and Fort Greble, were constructed on the bluffs that began just west and adjacent to Asylum Road. After the war, the Barry Farm housing development for freed slaves opened in 1867 and was rapidly occupied. Aslyum Avenue was named Nichols Avenue in 1879 in honor of hospital superintendent Charles Henry Nichols.
Asylum Avenue/Nichols Avenue was the only major southward road through the area until the 1890s, when the lower portion of South Capitol Street was constructed. A bridge connecting South Capitol Street to the area south of the Anacostia River was first proposed in 1889, but never acted on. However, in 1890, Colonel Arthur E. Randle founded the settlement of Congress Heights. The development was wildly successful, and he invested heavily in the Belt Railway, a local streetcar company. In 1895, Randle founded the Capital Railway Company, which constructed streetcar lines over the Navy Yard Bridge and down Nichols Avenue to Congress Heights.
The rapid development of Congress Heights and the areas adjacent to the streetcar line on Nichols Avenue led the government of the District of Columbia to extend South Capitol Street into the area east of the Anacostia River. The topography of the area largely dictated the route. Beginning near St. Elizabeths Hospital, a line of bluffs extended roughly southward until it reached what is now Chesapeake Street SW. (Fort Greble sat atop the southernmost of these cliffs.) To the west of these bluffs were broad, flat lowlands which provided pleasant views of the Potomac River and the picturesque city of Alexandria, Virginia. In 1893, the city surveyed South Capitol along the western side of these bluffs, laying out a broad, grand avenue. Once the bluffs ended, the route followed existing local roads and curved eastward to connect with Livingston Road (now the Indian Head Highway) at the District-Maryland line. But because of the lack of development south of Congress Heights, South Capitol Street was only constructed to its intersection with Nichols Avenue.
The two ends of South Capitol Street remained unconnected, however. Congress again considered building a South Capitol Street bridge in 1902 and 1926, but nothing came of these plans. The Army Corps of Engineers finally extended South Capitol Street from Nichols Avenue to the District boundary in 1940. Congress also approved a South Capitol Street bridge in 1940, but the onset of World War II prevented its funding and construction.
The South Capitol Street bridge was finally constructed in 1949 at a cost of $5 million. It was dedicated to Frederick Douglass in October 1965.
Route.
North of the Anacostia River, South Capitol Street runs in a straight north-south line. South Capitol Street begins at Southwest Drive, an access road on the south side of the grounds of the United States Capitol. It travels a half block south, and crosses Independence Avenue. Since roads on the grounds of the Capitol are closed to the public, this intersection has traditionally been the beginning of South Capitol Street. It it widens from a two-lane to four-lane thoroughfare just before reaching Washington Avenue SE, and then passes beneath Interstate 695. Northbound traffic on South Capitol Street may access Interstate 695 westbound, and eastbound Interstate 695 traffic may leave the elevated highway and access southbound South Capitol Street. South Capitol Street passed beneath M Street SE/SW via an underpass, although access roads on both sides of South Capitol Street provide service either way on M Street. South Capitol Street bifurcates alongside Nationals Park, home of the Washington Nationals major league baseball team. Its last intersection north of the Anacostia River is with Potomac Avenue SE.
South Capitol Street crosses the Anacostia via the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge, which is angled on a northwest-southeast line so that the bridge's southwest terminus does not occur on land owned by Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling. A "mixing bowl" of off- and on-ramps provides access to southbound Suitland Parkway, with an adjacent cloverleaf interchange giving access to Firth Sterling Avenue and the Anacostia Washington Metro station as well as northbound Interstate 295. South Capitol Street then follows a winding path along the eastern border of Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling. Deceleration lanes provide access to Malcolm X Avenue SE and the main gates of Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling and Interstate 295 again. South Capitol Street angles south-southeast at Overlook Avenue SW, passing below Interstate 295 and continues winding south-southeast until it reaches Southern Avenue. It is coterminous with Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE for a single block between Halley Place SE and 2nd Street SW before winding toward Southern Avenue and the District boundary line. 
The section of South Capitol Street between Washington Avenue SW and Suitland Parkway is part of the National Highway System.
South Capitol Street forms the north-northeastern boundary of Oxon Run Park 
Taxation Without Representation Street.
The D.C. City Council attempted to rename a portion of South Capitol Street adjacent to Nationals Park in 2008 as "Taxation Without Representation Street" in order to bring attention to the city's lack of voting rights in Congress. The goal, according to advocates, was to boost awareness by changing the address of Nationals Park. The name change required congressional approval. Congress failed to act on the bill, and it never became law.

The Real Group

The Real Group is a professional a cappella group from Sweden, consisting of five members: Emma Nilsdotter, Katarina Henryson, Anders Edenroth, Morten Vinther Sørensen, and Anders Jalkéus.
The group's members compose or arrange most of the songs that they perform. A large portion of the group's recorded songs are sung in English, with the remainder being almost entirely in Swedish. The group cites Bobby McFerrin as an early source of inspiration: "What we do may never have happened if we hadn't heard his .".
The Real Group has performed in more than 2000 concerts worldwide. In 2002 The Real Group performed at the opening ceremony of The FIFA World Cup in Seoul. They performed live to the audience of 60,000. On December 22, 1993, to commemorate the fiftieth birthday of Queen Silvia of Sweden, The Real Group backed up former ABBA member Anni-Frid Lyngstad in a performance of the ABBA hit "Dancing Queen", using an a cappella arrangement that would later be released on the album "Varför får man inte bara vara som man är".
Member changes.
The Real Group was formed in 1984, when its original members were students at the Swedish Royal College of Music. Margareta Bengtson had been the Soprano with the group since its inception but broke off from the group to work on her solo albums at the end of 2006. Johanna Nyström filled her spot for some time, until Emma Nilsdotter replaced her in 2008, and had her first appearance with the group in Kremlin Palace. Johanna Nyström has also filled in for both Margareta Bengtson and Katarina Henryson whenever they have been on maternity leave or otherwise away. Morten Vinther Sørensen joined the group in 2010 to replace Peder Karlsson, who has since shifted his focus to developing The Real Academy.

<doc id="2845793" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2845793" title="Arachne (web browser)">
Arachne (web browser)

Arachne is a full-screen Internet suite containing a graphical web browser, email client, and dialer. Originally, Arachne was developed by Michal Polák under his xChaos label, a name he later changed into Arachne Labs. It was written in C and compiled using Borland C++ 3.1. Arachne has since been released under the GPL as Arachne GPL.
Arachne primarily runs on DOS-based operating systems, but includes builds for Linux as well. The Linux version relies on SVGALib and therefore does not require a display server.
Background.
Arachne supports many file formats, protocols and standards including video modes from CGA 640×200 in monochrome to VESA 1024×768 in high color mode (65,536 colors). It is designed for systems that do not have any windowing systems installed.
Arachne supports multiple image formats including JPEG, PNG, BMP and animated GIF. It supports a subset of the HTML 4.0 and CSS 1.0 standards, including full support for tables and frames. Supported protocols include FTP, NNTP for USENET forums, POP3, SMTP and Gopher. Arachne includes a full-fledged TCP/IP connection suite, which has support for some dial-up and Ethernet connections. However, Arachne has no support for JavaScript, Java or SSL. Arachne can be expanded with the use of add-ons for such tasks as watching DivX movies, playing MP3 files, IRC chat, RSS and viewing PDF documents.
The first version of Arachne with a known release date was 1.0 Beta 2, which was released on 22 December 1996. The final and official version by Arachne Labs was 1.70R3 for DOS (released 22 January 2001) and 1.66 beta for Linux (released 20 July 2000). While there have been several more DOS versions, Linux development lay dormant until 24 May 2008 when a beta version 1.93 for Linux was released. The current DOS version, maintained by Glen McCorckle, is 1.97 as of 4 March 2013. In 2006, there also was an experimental DPMI port of Arachne by Udo Kuhnt, named DPMI Arachne.
Support.
Arachne supports a limited subset of stylesheets and HTML. Known support as of version 1.93:
Derivatives.
xChaos software licensed the source code of Arachne to Caldera UK in 1997. Caldera UK added Novell's dialer and TCP/IP stack, animated GIFs, printing on a multitude of printers, JavaScript (beta), completely changed the design of the browser (customizable), implemented their own support for frames, and ported it to compile as a 32-bit protected mode extended DOS application (utilizing DPMI using DJGPP, a GNU compiler for DOS), while Arachne is a 16-bit application. This program was sold as DR-WebSpyder; the name was to associate it with DR-DOS, which Caldera owned at the time. Later, when Caldera had transferred DR-DOS to its branch company Caldera Thin Clients, which became Lineo, the browser was renamed Lineo Embrowser.

Château de Pez

Château de Pez is a vineyard located across the road from Château Calon-Ségur, in the northern parts of Saint Estèphe. Traditionally one of the leading "Bourgeois Supérieur" wines of the Médoc, it is believed by some to deserve higher classification. In a 2003 Cru Bourgeois classification revision, it was listed as one of 9 "Cru Bourgeois Exceptionnels". It has a reputation of consistently producing wine that is both inexpensive and good.
History.
In the 17th century, the château was owned by the Pontac family who also owned Château Haut-Brion. The wine was sold under the Pontac label in London before any other Médoc wine. Today the château is owned by the champagne house Louis Roederer since 1995.

The Simulacra

The Simulacra is a 1964 science fiction novel by Philip K. Dick. The novel portrays a future totalitarian society apparently dominated by a matriarch, Nicole Thibodeaux. It revolves around the themes of reality and illusionary beliefs, as do many of Dick's works. Additionally, it touches on Nazi ideology.
Plot summary.
Set in the middle of the twenty-first century, "The Simulacra" is the story of several protagonists within the United States of Europe and America (USEA), formed by the merger of (West) Germany and the United States, where the whole government is a fraud and the President ("der Alte", "the Old Man") is a simulacrum (android). As well as the USEA, other global superpowers are the French Empire, People's Republic of China and Free (Black) Africa. There is some mention of a World War Three, which may have involved some tactical nuclear weapons, and a possibility that the Soviet Union exists. Communism still exists, but Poland has become its global centre of authority, with its administrative centre now based in Warsaw.
Society is stratified into 'Ges' (German "Geheimnisträger", "bearers of the secret" (the elite)) and 'Bes' (German "Befehlsträger", "implementers of instruction" (professional and artisanal)) classes, and there is conspicuous consolidation of political and broadcast media power. The Democratic and Republican Parties merged into a single party, the 'Democrat-Republican Party' and the 'United Triadic Network' presumably resulted from an amalgamation of NBC, CBS and ABC.
In addition, actual political power has devolved to a permanent First Lady, Nicole Thibodeaux, whose consorts are a series of male presidents – "die Alten". While the current "der Alte", Rudi Kalbfleisch, is a simulacrum, "Nicole" is human, although the original Nicole Thibodeaux died several decades ago. Since the death of the original, her role has been portrayed by four consecutive actors, and the latest such figure is Kate Rupert. This is a "Geheimnis" (secret), and insider possession of this secret is enough to insure elite membership through conferral of Ges status.
A secretive governing council controls the USEA, although 'Karp und Söhne Werke', as manufacturers of the current "der Alte"-simulacrum, exerts some power. The next simulacrum contract, for Dieter Hogbein, however, will be given to 'Frauenzimmer Associates', and Karp und Söhne is unhappy about this new contractual arrangement. One subplot involves the Karp und Söhne Werke threatened exposure of what has been a state secret over the last five decades. Nicole dislikes Kalbfleisch, although inbuilt obsolescence means that he is about to suffer an obligatory heart attack and he will be replaced in his turn. Kalbfleisch only momentarily appears in this novel.
Doctor Egon Superb encounters additional difficulties because A. G. Chemie, the leading USEA psycho-pharmaceutical drug cartel, has engineered the prohibition of psychotherapy under the "MacPhearson Act." However, the USEA is willing to let him continue to practice, and treat Richard Kongrosian, a well known pianist who performs in the White House. Richard Kongrosian believes that his body odor is lethal; this belief is delusional, he has no such body odor. Kongrosian has telekinetic abilities: he can play piano using only his mind. Nicole Thibodeaux is anxious to keep his abilities under control, as are Wilder Pembroke, head of the National Police, and members of the covert national governance council.
Bertold Goltz (an alleged neofascist) is seemingly trying to overthrow the government, and runs the 'Sons of Job', a religious paramilitary organisation, although he is not what he seems, and is secretly head of the covert USEA governing council. In addition, there is a subplot that involves Charles (Chic) Strikerock, Vince, his brother and a cut-price colonisation spacecraft sales firm (known as "Loony Lukes") involved in Martian colonisation. Mars boasts insectoid life, the sentient and empathic 'papoola', while Ganymede is inhabited by multicellular primitive life forms. 
Nothing is as it seems, and the novel ends inconclusively. The "der Alte"-simulacrum has been revealed as an android and Kate/Nicole has been disclosed as an impostor- therefore undoing the Geheimnis (secret) raison d'etre for ges/bes class stratification. Bertold Goltz is killed by a National Police detachment, as is the rest of the covert governing council. Using telekinesis, Kongrosian kills Pembroke before he can overthrow Nicole in a coup d'etat and teleports her to safety at his secluded Northern US home. Karp und Sohnen rebel against the abortive coup, however, and soon the National Police and USEA armed forces are engaged in civil war, with active use of low-yield nuclear weapons. Recrudescent Neanderthals (or "chuppers") seem happy at this turn of events, as they gather near Kongrosian's home: the imminent self-destruction of Homo sapiens might give them another opportunity to dominate Earth.

In 2007 it acquired the US homeland security consultancy "DFI International".
In July 2008, prospects of a bidding war for Detica emerged after BAE Systems made an informal offer. On 28 July 2008 the board of Detica and BAE Systems announced that the latter had made a formal cash offer of £4.40 for all issued and to-be-issued share capital. After acquiring over 92% of outstanding shares with shareholder approval, BAE declared its offer for Detica unconditional on 25 September 2008.
In 2010, BAE Systems acquired "Stratsec", the largest cyber security consultancy in Australia. In 2011, BAE Systems acquired the Irish Norkom Technologies, a financial crime and financial compliance software maker, and the Danish cyber and intelligence company "ETI/AS", which previously helped law enforcement and telecommunication providers in data-crime investigations.

Rolladen-Schneider LS9

__NOTOC__
The Rolladen-Schneider LS9 is an 18 metre single-seat motor glider launched in 2000 by Rolladen-Schneider. Production ended after just 10 gliders were built, when Rolladen-Schneider went into receivership.
Development.
The LS9 was the sole self-launching glider developed at Rolladen-Schneider. The prototype first flew in 1995, powered by a Rotax 535 two-stroke engine. Production of this engine was discontinued by Rotax, putting the LS9 project on hold pending the development of a suitable engine.
The Solo 2625 engine and a Technoflug two-blade propeller were finally selected. The engine installation, including the carbon composite propeller mast and folding exhaust system, was developed by the specialist firm Walter Binder Motorenbau GmbH, having nearly 100% commonality with the Schempp Hirth Ventus CM installation.

Badlands Wilderness

The Badlands Wilderness is located in the U.S. state of South Dakota. Entirely within Badlands National Park, the wilderness was designated by Congress in 1976, and is managed by the National Park Service. Badlands Wilderness, in southeastern Pennington County, includes 64,144 acres (560 km²) of the most pristine sections of the National Park. Within this wilderness, buffalo still roam free and visitors can also find bighorn sheep, coyotes and mule deer. There are no designated trails and camping is permitted anywhere in what is considered to be the largest undisturbed mixed-prairie rangeland remaining in the U.S. As this wilderness is managed by the National Park Service, hunting is not permitted.
U.S. Wilderness Areas do not allow motorized or mechanized vehicles, including bicycles. Although camping and fishing are allowed with proper permit, no roads or buildings are constructed and there is also no logging or mining, in compliance with the 1964 Wilderness Act. Wilderness areas within National Forests and Bureau of Land Management areas also allow hunting in season.

Gastone Brilli-Peri

Count Gastone Brilli-Peri (March 24, 1893 – March 22, 1930) was an Italian racing driver, who won the 1925 Italian Grand Prix in an Alfa Romeo P2, securing the inaugural World Manufacturers' Championship title for Alfa Romeo. Known simply as "Brilli", his face had been permanently scarred in an accident during a Tour of Italy motorcycle race. He used to race wearing a hat similar to a Basque beret, which is now known in Italy as a "brilliperi".
Biography.
Brilli-Peri was born in Florence into a noble family. He debuted in a bicycle race in 1907, aged 14. In 1911 he won the Tuscan cycling championship. In 1912 he bought a motorcycle, and in 1914 he debuted in a race at the Lake Trasimeno, winning the 1st Motogiro of Italy in the same year.
He first raced as car driver just after World War I, where he had acted as motorcycle driver. In 1925, in an Alfa Romeo P2, he won his first Grand Prix at the Italian Grand Prize at Monza. In 1929, still in the Alfa Romeo P2, he won the Circuit of Cremona and the Tripoli Grand Prix in Italian Libya.
Brilli-Peri was killed in 1930 during Saturday practice for the sixth Tripoli Grand Prix. Free practice had been scheduled from 11am to 15pm and Brilli-Peri, who knew the track well having won the race one year earlier, came to test the cars of his team, the Scuderia Materassi.
He first made one lap on his car, then moved to the vehicle of his teammate Clemente Biondetti, which had carburation problems. Brilli-Peri made one lap with Biondetti's car and then jumped again in his Talbot for another stint. However, during the second lap he crashed heavily near the village of Suq al Jum’ah (also known as Suk el Giuma or Sugh el Giumaa (سوق الجمعة)) and was killed on impact.
According to eyewitnesses, while negotiating a fast left-handed bend, the car bounced on the irregular surface of the track. Brilli-Peri could not control it anymore and went straight into the right embankment, being ejected from the vehicle. The accident happened around 12h50. The race (composed of two heats - the first of them for voiturettes only - and a final), was won by Baconin Borzacchini in a Maserati. Clemente Biondetti won the voiturette heat and was classified third in the final.
Brilli-Peri died at the age of 37 years old. Today the stadium of his native city, Montevarchi, is named in his honour. The Italian actress Nancy Brilli is a niece of Brilli-Peri.

Métallurgique

Métallurgique were cars made by SA L'Auto Métallurgique, Marchienne-au-Pont, Belgium between 1898 and 1928. Before making cars, the company had made railway locomotives and rolling stock.
Production.
The first cars were 4.5-hp, 2-cylinder models with chain drive, but in 1905 a new modern range was introduced, designed by Ernst Lehmann, who joined them from Daimler in 1903. These cars, with pressed-steel chassis, live rear axle and the option of electric lighting, were to establish the company as one of the finest makers of sporting cars in Europe. In 1906 there came the 4-cylinder, 10-litre 60/80 with inlet over exhaust valves and a claimed output of 100 bhp at 1400 rpm. The cars got a distinctive V front radiator in 1906. For 1908 the car range included the 60/80 and the 40-hp, which was a smaller version of the 60/80, the 2-cylinder cars being finally dropped. They were joined in 1909 by the smaller 5-litre 26-hp, and in 1911 all cars got 4-speed gearboxes. Bodywork was made by Vanden Plas.
Métallurgique cars were also made from 1909 under licence by Bergmann in Berlin, Germany who had previously made electric cars. These were sold as Bergmann-Métallurgique.
After World War I, car production restarted with the 26-hp, which gained Adex 4-wheel brakes, the 20/40 and the 15/20. The first post-war designs arrived in 1921 with the 3-litre and, more importantly, the 2-litre overhead-cam tourer designed by Paul Bastien.
Takeover.
The company was taken over by Imperia in 1927 and the factory was acquired by Minerva. The name was dropped. Paul Bastien joined Stutz in America where he was responsible for the Vertical Eight.
This historic marque has a great following and La Societe Anonyme des Automobiles Métallurgique has been set up to bring Métallurgique owners together.

<doc id="2845886" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2845886" title="Observational science">
Observational science

Observational science is part of a proposal that suggests science is composed of two principle methods of understanding: 'observational' and 'historical'. In observational science, it is not possible to construct controlled experiments within the area under study. For example, in astronomy, it is not possible to create or manipulate stars or galaxies in order to observe what happens, and so it may be argued that astronomy is 'observational'. Other examples of observational sciences may include geology, paleontology, epidemiology, and the social sciences.
It's worth noting that other fields of scientific study can have observational as well as experimental aspects. In high-energy physics, for example, some interactions involving energies higher than can be created in any experiment can be observed indirectly through astronomical observations.
To substitute for the inability to directly construct experiments as part of the scientific method, two main strategies are used. First, multivariate statistical techniques allow the approximation of experimental control with statistical control. Secondly, experimental observations of previously-unobserved phenomena can be used to suggest new hypotheses and test existing ones.
In the social sciences, sociology and economics are generally held to be examples of observational sciences, because of the impracticality (not to mention dubious ethical status) of manipulating whole societies or economies for experimental purposes. However, microeconomics can be regarded as an experimental science, because it is possible to set up experimental micro-economies.
Sometimes fields of study can change from being observational to being experimental: for example, until the early 21st century, the study of comets was entirely observational -- it became experimental when the first man-made cometary collision was engineered in 2005.
Currently, the scientific community does not recognize "historical" and "observational" as being valid descriptions of the scientific process.

Windy Gyle

Windy Gyle is a hill in the Cheviot Hills, right on the border between England and Scotland. It lies on the border ridge, and like the other hills in the area is rounded and grass-covered. Although maps show the border passing right through the summit, the summit cairn lies a few metres north of the fence that marks the border. The cairn at the summit of this hill is titled Russel's Cairn, the cairn has a small depression suitable for shielding 15 people from the wind.
The Pennine Way crosses the summit, thus providing one possible route of ascent. Windy Gyle may also be climbed from the Coquet valley to the south (England), or from Cocklawfoot to the north (Scotland). There are a number or routes from both sides, and circular walks are possible.
There are good views from the summit north towards the Scottish Borders, Eildon Hills and Edinburgh.

<doc id="2845897" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2845897" title="Nazi propaganda">
Nazi propaganda

Propaganda was used by the Nazi Party in the years leading up to and during Adolf Hitler's leadership of Germany (1933–1945). National Socialist propaganda provided a crucial instrument for acquiring and maintaining power, and for the implementation of their policies, including the pursuit of total war and the extermination of millions of people in the Holocaust.
The pervasive use of propaganda by the Nazis is largely responsible for the word "propaganda" itself acquiring its present negative connotations.
Chronology.
In opposition (1919–33).
Nazi leader Adolf Hitler devoted three chapters of his 1925/26 book "Mein Kampf", itself a propaganda tool, to the study and practice of propaganda. He claimed to have learnt the value of propaganda as a World War I infantryman exposed to very effective British and ineffectual German propaganda. The argument that Germany lost the war largely because of British propaganda efforts, expounded at length in "Mein Kampf", reflected then-common German nationalist claims. Although untrue – German propaganda during World War I was mostly more advanced than that of the British – it became the official truth of Nazi Germany thanks to its reception by Hitler.
"Mein Kampf" contains the blueprint of later Nazi propaganda efforts. Assessing his audience, Hitler writes in chapter VI:
"Propaganda must always address itself to the broad masses of the people. (...) All propaganda must be presented in a popular form and must fix its intellectual level so as not to be above the heads of the least intellectual of those to whom it is directed. (...) The art of propaganda consists precisely in being able to awaken the imagination of the public through an appeal to their feelings, in finding the appropriate psychological form that will arrest the attention and appeal to the hearts of the national masses.
The broad masses of the people are not made up of diplomats or professors of public jurisprudence nor simply of persons who are able to form reasoned judgment in given cases, but a vacillating crowd of human children who are constantly wavering between one idea and another. (...) The great majority of a nation is so feminine in its character and outlook that its thought and conduct are ruled by sentiment rather than by sober reasoning. This sentiment, however, is not complex, but simple and consistent. It is not highly differentiated, but has only the negative and positive notions of love and hatred, right and wrong, truth and falsehood."
As to the methods to be employed, he explains:
"Propaganda must not investigate the truth objectively and, in so far as it is favourable to the other side, present it according to the theoretical rules of justice; yet it must present only that aspect of the truth which is favourable to its own side. (...) The receptive powers of the masses are very restricted, and their understanding is feeble. On the other hand, they quickly forget. Such being the case, all effective propaganda must be confined to a few bare essentials and those must be expressed as far as possible in stereotyped formulas. These slogans should be persistently repeated until the very last individual has come to grasp the idea that has been put forward. (...) Every change that is made in the subject of a propagandist message must always emphasize the same conclusion. The leading slogan must of course be illustrated in many ways and from several angles, but in the end one must always return to the assertion of the same formula."
Hitler put these ideas into practice with the reestablishment of the "Völkischer Beobachter", a daily newspaper published by the Nazi Party (NSDAP) from February 1925 on, whose circulation reached 26,175 in 1929. It was joined in 1926 by Joseph Goebbels's "Der Angriff", another unabashedly and crudely propagandistic paper.
During most of the Nazis' time in opposition, their means of propaganda remained limited. With little access to mass media, the party continued to rely heavily on Hitler and a few others speaking at public meetings until 1929. In April 1930, Hitler appointed Goebbels head of party propaganda. Goebbels, a former journalist and Nazi party officer in Berlin, soon proved his skills. Among his first successes was the organization of riotous demonstrations that succeeded in having the American anti-war film "All Quiet on the Western Front" banned in Germany.
In power (1933–39).
On 13 March 1933, The Third Reich established a Ministry of Propaganda, appointing Joseph Goebbels as its Minister. Goals were to establish external enemies (countries that allegedly inflicted the Treaty of Versailles on Germany - by territorial claims and ethnocentrism) and internal enemies, such as Jews, Romani, homosexuals, Bolsheviks and topics like degenerate art. 
A major political and ideological cornerstone of Nazi policy was the unification of all ethnic Germans living outside of the Reich's borders under one Greater Germany (e.g. Austria and Czechoslovakia). In "Mein Kampf", Hitler made a direct remark to those outside of Germany. He stated that pain and misery were being forced upon ethnic Germans outside of Germany, and that they dream of common fatherland. He finished by stating they needed to fight for one's nationality. Throughout "Mein Kampf", he pushed Germans worldwide to make the struggle for political power and independence their main focus. Nazi propaganda used the "Heim ins Reich" policy for this, which began in 1938.
For months prior to the beginning of World War II in 1939, German newspapers and leaders had carried out a national and international propaganda campaign accusing Polish authorities of organizing or tolerating violent ethnic cleansing of ethnic Germans living in Poland. On 22 August, Adolf Hitler told his generals:
The main part of this propaganda campaign was the false flag project, Operation Himmler, which was designed to create the appearance of Polish aggression against Germany, which was subsequently used to justify the invasion of Poland.
Anti-Semitism.
Hitler and Nazi propagandists played on the anti-Semitism and resentment present in Germany. The Jews were blamed for things such as robbing the German people of their hard work while themselves avoiding physical labour. "Der Stürmer", a Nazi propaganda newspaper, told Germans that Jews kidnapped small children before Passover because "Jews need the blood of a Christian child, maybe, to mix in with their Matzah." Posters, films, cartoons, and fliers were seen throughout Germany which attacked the Jewish community.
Euthanasia.
The Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring was introduced in July 14, 1933, and various propaganda was used to target the disabled. A special euthanasia program, called T-4 Euthanasia Program begun in 1939, related propaganda arguments were based on the books, "Die Freigabe der Vernichtung lebensunwerten Lebens" ("Allowing the Destruction of Life Unworthy of Living"), written by Karl Binding and Alfred Hoche and the book "Human Heredity Theory and Racial Hygiene", written by Eugen Fischer, Erwin Baur and Fritz Lenz.
Nuremberg Laws.
In 1935, anti-semitic laws in Nazi Germany were introduced known as the Nuremberg Laws, the laws forbid non-Aryans and political opponents of the Nazis from the civil-service and any sexual relations and marriage between people classified as "Aryan" and "non-Aryan" (Jews, Gypsies, blacks). The Nuremberg Laws were based on racial purity, they sought to preserve the Aryan race who were at the top of the Nazi racial hierarchy and were said to be the ubermenschen "herrenvolk" (master race), and to teach the German nation to view the Jews as subhumans.
Political opponents.
Soon after the takeover of power in 1933, Nazi concentration camps were established for political opponents. The first people that were sent to the camps were Communists. They were sent because of their ties with the Soviet Union and because Nazism greatly opposed Communism.
Treaty of Versailles.
When the Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919, non-propagandists newspapers headlines across the nation spoke German's feelings, such as "UNACCEPTABLE" which appeared on the front page of the "Frankfurter Zeitung" in 1919. The "Berliner Tageblatt", also in 1919, predicted "Should we accept the conditions, a military furore for revenge will sound in Germany within a few years, a militant nationalism will engulf all." Hitler, knowing his nation's disgust with the Treaty, used it as leverage to influence his audience. He would repeatedly refer back to the terms of the Treaty as a direct attack on Germany and its people. In one speech delivered on 30 January 1937 he directly stated that he was withdrawing the German signature from the document to protest the outrageous proportions of the terms. He claimed the Treaty made Germany out to be inferior and "less" of a country than others only because blame for the war was placed on it. The success of Nazi propagandists and Hitler won the Nazi party control of Germany and eventually led to World War II.
At war (1939–45).
Until the conclusion of the Battle of Stalingrad on 4 February 1943, German propaganda emphasized the prowess of German arms and the humanity German soldiers had shown to the peoples of occupied territories. Pilots of the Allied bombing fleets were depicted as cowardly murderers, and Americans in particular as gangsters in the style of Al Capone. At the same time, German propaganda sought to alienate Americans and British from each other, and both these Western nations from the Soviets. One of the primary sources for propaganda was the Wehrmachtbericht, a daily radio broadcast that described the military situation on all fronts. Nazi victories lent themselves easily to propaganda broadcasts and were at this point difficult to mishandle. Satires on the defeated, accounts of attacks, and praise for the fallen all were useful for Nazis. Still, failures were not easily handled even at this stage; when the "Ark Royal" proved to have survived an attack that German propaganda had hyped, considerable embarrassment resulted.
After Stalingrad, the main theme changed to Germany as the sole defender of what they called "Western European culture" against the "Bolshevist hordes". The introduction of the V-1 and V-2 "vengeance weapons" was emphasized to convince Britons of the hopelessness of defeating Germany.
Problems in propaganda arose easily in this stage; expectations of success were raised too high and too quickly, which required explanation if they were not fulfilled, and blunted the effects of success, and the hushing of blunders and failures caused mistrust. The increasing hardship of the war for the German people also called forth more propaganda that the war had been forced on the German people by the refusal of foreign powers to accept their strength and independence. Goebbels called for propaganda to toughen up the German people and not make victory look easy.
On 23 June 1944, the Nazis permitted the Red Cross to visit concentration camp Theresienstadt to dispel rumors about the Final Solution, which was intended to kill every Jew. In reality, Theresienstadt was a transit camp for Jews en route to extermination camps, but in a sophisticated propaganda effort, fake shops and cafés were erected to imply that the Jews lived in relative comfort. The guests enjoyed the performance of a children's opera, "Brundibar", written by inmate Hans Krása. The hoax was so successful for the Nazis that they went on to make a propaganda film ("Theresienstadt") at Theresienstadt. Shooting of the film began on 26 February 1944. Directed by Kurt Gerron, it was meant to show how well the Jews lived under the "benevolent" protection of the Third Reich. After the shooting, most of the cast, and even the filmmaker himself, were deported to the concentration camp of Auschwitz where they were murdered. 
Hans Fritzsche, who had been head of the Radio Chamber, was tried and acquitted by the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal.
Mass cult and rituals.
The Nazis crafted a mass cult, through large orchestrated political military ‘rallies’, or highly organised events with banners and marching bands. The goal was to appeal to the patriotism of the German people.
Media.
Books.
The Nazis and sympathizers published many books. Most of the beliefs that would become associated with the Nazis, such as German nationalism, eugenics and anti-Semitism had been in circulation since the 19th century, and the Nazis seized on this body of existing work in their own publications.
The most notable is Adolf Hitler's "Mein Kampf" detailing his beliefs. The book outlines major ideas that would later culminate in World War II. It is heavily influenced by Gustave Le Bon's 1895 "The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind", which theorized propaganda as a way to control the seemingly irrational behaviour of crowds. Particularly prominent is the violent anti-Semitism of Hitler and his associates, drawing, among other sources, on the fabricated "Protocols of the Elders of Zion" (1897), which implied that Jews secretly conspired to rule the world. This book was a key source of propaganda for the Nazis and helped fuel their common hatred against the Jews during World War II. For example, Hitler claimed that the international language Esperanto was part of a Jewish plot and makes arguments toward the old German nationalist ideas of "Drang nach Osten" and the necessity to gain Lebensraum ("living space") eastwards (especially in Russia).
Other books such as "Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes" (Ethnology of German People) by Hans F. K. Günther and "Rasse und Seele" (Race and Soul) by Dr. attempt to identify and classify the differences between the German, Nordic, or Aryan type and other supposedly inferior peoples. These books were used as texts in German schools during the Nazi era.
The pre-existing and popular genre of "Schollen-roman", or novel of the soil, also known as "blood and soil" novels, was given a boost by the acceptability of its themes to the Nazis and developed a mysticism of unity.
The immensely popular "Red Indian" stories by Karl May were permitted despite the heroic treatment of the hero Winnetou and "colored" races; instead, the argument was made that the stories demonstrated the fall of the Red Indians was caused by a lack of racial consciousness, to encourage it in the Germans. Other fictional works were also adapted; "Heidi" was stripped of its Christian elements, and Robinson Crusoe's relationship to Friday was made a master-slave one.
Children's books also made their appearance. In 1938, Julius Streicher published "Der Giftpilz" (The Poisonous Mushroom), a storybook that equated the Jewish people to poisonous mushrooms and aimed to educate children about the Jews. The book was an example of anti-Semitic propaganda and stated that, "The following tales tell the truth about the Jewish poison mushroom. They show the many shapes the Jew assumes. They show the depravity and baseness of the Jewish race. They show the Jew for what he really is: The Devil in human form."
Textbooks.
"Geopolitical atlases" emphasized Nazi schemes, demonstrating the "encirclement" of Germany, depicting how the prolific Slav nations would cause the German people to be overrun, and (in contrast) showing the relative population density of Germany was much higher than that of the Eastern regions (where they would seek Lebensraum). Geography text books stated how crowded Germany had become. Other charts would show the cost of disabled children as opposed to healthy ones, or show how two-child families threatened the birthrate. Math books discussed military applications and used military word problems, physics and chemistry concentrated on military applications, and grammar classes were devoted to propaganda sentences. Other textbooks dealt with the history of the Nazi Party. Elementary school reading text included large amounts of propaganda. Children were taught through textbooks that they were the Aryan master race ("Herrenvolk") while the Jews were untrustworthy, parasitic and "Untermenschen" (inferior subhumans).
Maps showing the racial composition of Europe were banned from the classroom after many efforts that did not define the territory widely enough for party officials.
Even fairy tales were put to use, with "Cinderella" being presented as a tale of how the prince's racial instincts lead him to reject the stepmother's alien blood for the racially pure maiden. Nordic sagas were likewise presented as the illustration of Führerprinzip, which was developed with such heroes as Frederick the Great and Otto von Bismarck.
Literature was to be chosen within the "German spirit" rather than a fixed list of forbidden and required, which made the teachers all the more cautious although Jewish authors were impossible for classrooms. While only William Shakespeare's "MacBeth" and "The Merchant of Venice" were actually recommended, none of the plays were actually forbidden, even "Hamlet", denounced for "flabbiness of soul."
Biology texts, however, were put to the most use in presenting eugenic principles and racial theories; this included explanations of the Nuremberg Laws, which were claimed to allow the German and Jewish peoples to co-exist without the danger of mixing. Science was to be presented as the most natural area for introducing the "Jewish Question", once teachers took care to point out that in nature, animals associated with those of their own species.
Teachers' guidelines on racial instruction presented both the handicapped and Jews as dangers. Despite their many photographs glamorizing the "Nordic" type, the texts also claimed that visual inspection was insufficient, and genealogical analysis was required to determine their types, and report any hereditary problems. However, the National Socialist Teachers League (NSLB) stressed that at primary schools in particular they had to work on only the Nordic racial core of the German "Volk" again and again and have to contrast this with the racial composition of foreign populations and the Jews.
Books for occupied countries.
In occupied France, the German Institute encouraged translation of German works, although chiefly German nationalists, not ardent Nazis, and produced a massive increase in the sale of translated works. The only books from English to be sold were English classics, and books with Jewish authors or Jewish subject matter (such as biographies) were banned, except for some scientific works. Control of the paper supply allowed Germans the easy ability to pressure publishers about books.
Comics.
The Nazi-controlled government in German-occupied France produced the "Vica" comic book series during World War II as a propaganda tool against the Allied forces. The Vica series, authored by Vincent Krassousky, represented Nazi influence and perspective in French society, and included such titles as "Vica contre le service secret anglais", and "Vica défie l’Oncle Sam".
Films.
The Nazis produced many films to promote their views. The Department of Film was important for organizing film propaganda. It has been estimated that 45 million people attended film screenings put on by the NSDAP. Reichsamtsleiter Neumann declared that the goal of the Department of Film was not directly political in nature, but was rather to influence the culture, education, and entertainment of the general population.
A main medium was Die Deutsche Wochenschau, a newsreel series produced for cinemas, from 1940. Newsreels were explicitly intended to portray German interests as successful. 
Themes often included the virtues of the Nordic or Aryan type, German military and industrial strength, and the evils of the Nazi enemies. 
On 22 September 1933, a Department of Film was incorporated into the Chamber of Culture. The department controlled the licensing of every film prior to its production. Sometimes, the government would select the actors for a film, financing the production partially or totally, and would grant tax breaks to the producers. Awards for "valuable" films would decrease taxes, thus encouraging self-censorship among movie makers.
Under Goebbels and Hitler, the German film industry became entirely nationalised. The National Socialist Propaganda Directorate, which Goebbels oversaw, had at its disposal nearly all film agencies in Germany by 1936. Occasionally, certain directors such as Wolfgang Liebeneiner were able to bypass Goebbels by providing him with a different version of the film than would be released. Such films include those directed by Helmut Käutner: "Romanze in Moll" ("Romance in a Minor Key", 1943), "Große Freiheit Nr. 7" ("The Great Freedom, No. 7", 1944), and "Unter den Brücken" ("Under the Bridges", 1945).
Schools were also provided with motion pictures projectors because film was regarded as particularly appropriate for propagandizing children. Films specifically created for schools were termed "military education."
"Triumph des Willens" ("Triumph of the Will", 1935) by film-maker Leni Riefenstahl chronicles the Nazi Party Congress of 1934 in Nuremberg. It followed an earlier film of the 1933 Nuremberg Rally produced by Riefenstahl, Der Sieg des Glaubens. Triumph of the Will features footage of uniformed party members (though relatively few German soldiers), who are marching and drilling to militaristic tunes. The film contains excerpts from speeches given by various Nazi leaders at the Congress, including speeches by Adolf Hitler. Frank Capra used scenes from the film, which he described partially as "the ominous prelude of Hitler's holocaust of hate" in many parts of the U.S. government's "Why We Fight" anti-Axis seven film series, to demonstrate what the personnel of the American military would be facing in World War II, and why the Axis had to be defeated.
"Der ewige Jude" ("The Eternal Jew", 1940) was directed by Fritz Hippler at the insistence of Goebbels, though the writing is credited to Eberhard Taubert. The movie is done in the style of a documentary, the central thesis being the immutable racial personality traits that characterize the Jew as a wandering cultural parasite. Throughout the film, these traits are contrasted to the Nazi state ideal: while Aryan men find satisfaction in physical labour and the creation of value, Jews only find pleasure in money and a hedonist lifestyle.
Fine art.
By Nazi standards, fine art was not propaganda. Its purpose was to create ideals, for eternity. This produced a call for heroic and romantic art, which reflected the ideal rather than the realistic. Explicitly political paintings were very rare. Still more rare were anti-Semitic paintings, because the art was supposed to be on a higher plane. Nevertheless, selected themes, common in propaganda, were the most common topics of art.
Sculpture was used as an expression of Nazi racial theories. The most common image was of the nude male, expressing the ideal of the Aryan race. Nudes were required to be physically perfect. At the Paris Exposition of 1937, Josef Thorak's "Comradeship" stood outside the German pavilion, depicting two enormous nude males, clasping hands and standing defiantly side by side, in a pose of defense and racial camaraderie.
Landscape painting featured mostly heavily in the Greater German Art exhibition, in accordance with themes of blood and soil. Peasants were also popular images, reflecting a simple life in harmony with nature, frequently with large families. With the advent of war, war art came to be a significant though still not predominating proportion.
The continuing of the German Art Exhibition throughout the war was put forth as a manifestation of German's culture.
Magazines.
In and after 1939, the "Zeitschriften-Dienst" was sent to magazines to provide guidelines on what to write for appropriate topics.
Nazi publications also carried various forms of propaganda.
"Neues Volk", was a monthly publication of the Office of Racial Policy, which answered questions about acceptable race relations. While it mainly was aimed at regarding race relations, it also included articles about the strength and character of the Aryan race compared to Jews and other "defectives".
The "NS-Frauen-Warte", aimed at women, included such topics as the role of women in the Nazi state. Despite its propaganda elements, it was predominately a woman's magazine. It defended anti-intellectualism, urged women to have children, even in wartime, put forth what the Nazis had done for women, discusses bridal schools, urged women to greater efforts in total war.
"Der Pimpf" was aimed at boys and contained both adventure and propaganda.
"Das deutsche Mädel", in contrast, recommended for girls hiking, tending the wounded, and preparing for care for children. It lay far more emphasis than "NS-Frauen-Warte" on the strong and active German woman.
Signal.
"Signal" was a propaganda magazine published by the Wehrmacht during World War II. It was distributed throughout occupied Europe and neutral countries. "Signal" was published from April 1940 to March 1945, and had the highest sales of any magazine published in Europe during the period 1940 to 1945—circulation peaked at two and one half million in 1943. At various times, it was published in at least twenty languages. There was an English edition distributed in the British Channel Islands of Guernsey, Jersey, Alderney, and Sark—these islands were occupied by the Wehrmacht during World War II.
The promoter of the magazine was the chief of the Wehrmacht propaganda office, Colonel Hasso von Wedel. Its annual budget was 10 million Reichmarks, roughly $2.5 million at the pre-war exchange rate.
The image that "Signal" hoped to create was that of Nazi Germany and its New Order as the great benefactor of European peoples and of Western civilization in general. Germany and its allies were depicted as the humane liberators of the occupied nations. Some articles displayed color photographs of dramatic battle scenes. The magazine contained little anti-Semitic propaganda, and the Jews were hardly mentioned.
Newspapers.
The "Völkischer Beobachter" ("People's Observer") was the official daily newspaper of the NSDAP since December 1920. It disseminated Nazi ideology in the form of brief hyperboles directed against the weakness of parliamentarism, the evils of Jewry and Bolshevism, the national humiliation of the Versailles Treaty and other such topics. It was joined in 1926 by "Der Angriff" ("The Attack"), a weekly and later daily paper founded by Joseph Goebbels. It was mainly dedicated to attacks against political opponents and Jews – one of its most striking features were vehemently antisemitic cartoons by Hans Schweitzer – but also engaged in the glorification of Nazi heroes such as Horst Wessel. The "Illustrierter Beobachter" was their weekly illustrated paper.
Other Nazi publications included
After Hitler's rise to power in 1933, all of the regular press came under complete Nazi editorial control through the policy of "Gleichschaltung", and short-lived propaganda newspapers were also established in the conquered territories during World War II. Alfred Rosenberg was a key member of the Nazi party who gained control of their newspaper which was openly praised by Hitler. However, Hitler was dissatisfied by Rosenberg's work and slandered Rosenberg behind his back, discrediting his work.
Newspapers in occupied countries.
In Ukraine, after Nazis cracked down on the papers, most papers printed only articles from German agencies, producing the odd effect of more anti-American and anti-British articles than anti-Communist ones. They also printed articles about antecedents of German rule over Ukraine, such as Catherine the Great and the Goths.
Photography.
The Nazis also implemented a number of photographers to document events and promote ideology. Photographers include Heinrich Hoffmann and Hugo Jaeger.
Posters.
Poster art was a mainstay of the Nazi propaganda effort, aimed both at Germany itself and occupied territories. It had several advantages. The visual effect, being striking, would reach the viewer easily. Posters were also, unlike other forms of propaganda, difficult to avoid.
Imagery frequently drew on heroic realism. Nazi youth and the SS were depicted monumentally, with lighting posed to produce grandeur.
Hans Schweitzer, under the pen name "Mjölnir" produced many Nazi posters.
Posters were also used in schools, depicting, for instance, an institution for the feeble-minded on one hand and houses on the other, to inform the students that the annual cost of this institution would build 17 homes for healthy families.
Radio.
Before Hitler came to power, he rarely used the radio as a form of connection with the public, and when he did so non-party newspapers were allowed to publish his speeches. This changed soon after he came to power in 1933. Hitler's speeches became famous all over Germany and were often major events for the Germans. Hitler's speeches were broadcast on the national radio, every newspaper (members of the Nazi party or not) published his speeches, they were shown in the weekly newsreels, and reprinted in large editions in books and pamphlets all across Germany. The speeches made by Hitler became so significant to the Nazis that even restaurants and pubs were expected have their radios on whenever Hitler was delivering one of his speeches and in some cities public speakers were used so passersby could hear him deliver one of his speeches. The extent that Nazi propaganda emphasized and portrayed his speeches was done so that the main points of his speeches appeared in the weekly posters and were all over Germany by the hundreds of thousands.
The radio was an important tool in Nazi propaganda and was also used to promote genocide.
Internal broadcasts.
Certainly the Nazis recognised the importance of radio in disseminating their message and to that end Goebbels approved a scheme whereby millions of cheap radio sets (the "Volksempfänger") were subsidised by the government. Goebbels claimed the radio was the "eighth great power", and he, along with the Nazi party, recognized the power of the radio in the propaganda machine of Nazi Germany. In the ""Radio as the Eighth Great Power"" speech, Goebbels proclaimed: 
By the start of the Second World War, over 70% of German households had one of these radios, which were deliberately limited in range in order to prevent loyal citizens from considering other viewpoints in foreign broadcasts. Radio broadcasts were also played over loudspeakers in public places and workplaces.
In private homes, however, people could easily turn off the radio when bored and did so once the novelty of hearing the voice from a box wore off; this caused the Nazis to introduce many non-propaganda elements, such as music, advice and tips, serials and other entertainment. This was accelerated during the war to prevent people from tuning in enemy propaganda broadcasts; though Goebbels claimed in his "Das Reich" article that it was to make the radio a good companion to the people, he admitted the truth in his diary.
External broadcasts.
As well as domestic broadcasts, the Nazi regime also used radio to deliver its message to both occupied territories and enemy states. One of the main targets was the United Kingdom to which William Joyce broadcast regularly, gaining the nickname 'Lord Haw-Haw' in the process. Joyce first appeared on German radio on 6 September 1939 reading the news in English but soon became noted for his often mischievous propaganda broadcasts. Joyce was executed in 1946 for treason. Although the most notorious, and most regularly heard, of the UK propagandists, Joyce was not the only broadcaster, with others such as Norman Baillie-Stewart, Jersey-born teacher Pearl Vardon, British Union of Fascists members Leonard Banning and Susan Hilton, Barry Payne Jones of the Link and Alexander Fraser Grant, whose show was aimed specifically at Scotland, also broadcasting through the 'New British Broadcasting Service'.
Broadcasts were also made to the United States, notably through Robert Henry Best and 'Axis Sally' Mildred Gillars. Best, a freelance journalist based in Vienna, was initially arrested following the German declaration of war on the US but before long he became a feature on propaganda radio, attacking the influence of the Jews in the US and the leadership of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who succeeded Winston Churchill in Nazi propaganda as "World-Enemy Number One". Best would later be sentenced to life imprisonment for treason. Gillars, a teacher in Germany, mostly broadcast on similar themes as well as peppering her speech with allegations of infidelity against the wives of servicemen. Her most notorious broadcast was the 'Vision of Invasion' radio play, broadcast immediately prior to D-Day, from the perspective of an American mother who dreamed that her soldier son died violently in Normandy.
France also received broadcasts from Radio-Stuttgart, where Paul Ferdonnet, an anti-Semitic journalist, was the main voice during the Phoney War. Following the occupation, Radio Paris and Radio Vichy became the main organs of propaganda, with leading far right figures such as Jacques Doriot, Philippe Henriot and Jean Hérold-Paquis regularly speaking in support of the Nazis. Others who broadcast included Gerald Hewitt, a British citizen who lived most of his life in Paris and had been associated with Action Française. The use of domestic broadcasters intended to galvanise support for occupation was also used in Belgium, where Ward Hermans regularly spoke in support of the Nazis from his base in Bremen, and the Italian Social Republic, to where Giovanni Preziosi broadcast a vehemently anti-Semitic show from his base in Munich. Pro-Nazi radio broadcasts in the Arabic language aired in North Africa, crafted with the help of Mohammad Amin al-Husayni and other Arab exiles in Berlin to highlight Arab nationalism. They recast Nazi racist ideology to target Jews alone, not all Semites. Downplaying Mussolini's operations in Africa, they touted the anti-colonialism of the Axis powers.
Speakers.
The Nazi party relied heavily on speakers to make its propaganda presentations, most heavily before they came to power, but also afterwards. Hitler, in "Mein Kampf", recounted that he had realized that it was not written matter but the spoken word that brought about changes, as people would not read things that disagreed, but would linger to hear a speaker. Furthermore, speakers, having their audiences before them, could see their reactions and adjust accordingly, to persuade. His own oratory was a major factor in his rise, and he despised those who came to read pre-written speeches.
Such speakers were particularly important when it was not wanted that the information put across not reach foreigners, who could access the mass media. Schools were instituted to substitute for the political conflict that had formed the old speakers. In 1939, , speaking of his own experience as an early speaker, urged that they continue.
Sturmabteilung speakers were used, though their reliance on instinct sometimes offended well-educated audiences, but their blunt and folksy manner often had their own appeal.
The ministry would provide such speakers with information, such as how to spin the problems on the eastern front, or how to discuss the cuts in food rations. The party propaganda headquarters, sent the "Redner-Schnellinformation" Express Information out with guidelines for immediate campaigns, such as anti-Semitic campaigns and what information to present.
Specific groups were targeted with such speakers. Speakers, for instance, were created specifically for Hitler Youth. These would, among other things, lecture Hitler Youth and the BDM on the need to produce more children.
Themes.
Nazi propaganda promoted Nazi ideology by demonizing the enemies of the Nazi Party, especially Jews and communists, but also capitalists and intellectuals. It promoted the values asserted by the Nazis, including heroic death, "Führerprinzip" (leader principle), "Volksgemeinschaft" (people's community), "Blut und Boden" (blood and soil) and the youth were taught early to take pride in the Germanic master race ("Herrenvolk"). Propaganda was also used to maintain the cult of personality around Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, and to promote campaigns for eugenics and the annexation of German-speaking areas. After the outbreak of World War II, Nazi propaganda vilified Germany's enemies, notably the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States, and exhorted the population to partake in total war.
Historiography.
Nazi propaganda is a relatively recent topic of close study. Historians of all persuasions, including Eastern Bloc writers, agree about its remarkable effectiveness. Their assessment of its significance, however – whether it "shaped" or merely directed and exploited public opinion – is influenced by their approach to wider questions raised by the study of Nazi Germany, such as the question whether the Nazi state was a fully totalitarian dictatorship, as argued by Hannah Arendt, or whether it also depended on a certain societal consensus.
In addition to media archives, an important primary source for the study of the Nazi propaganda effort are the reports on civilian morale and public opinion that the "Sicherheitsdienst" and later the RMVP compiled from 1939 on. Another are the "Deutschland-Berichte", reports gathered by underground agents of the "Sopade" that particularly dealt with German popular opinion.

Peter Doherty (footballer)

Peter Dermot Doherty (5 June 1913 – 6 April 1990) was a Northern Ireland international footballer and manager who played for several clubs, including Manchester City and Doncaster Rovers.
An inside left, he was one of the top players of his time, winning a league title with Manchester City, an F.A. Cup final with Derby County in which he scored, and gained 16 caps for Ireland. His later career saw him as the central figure as player and manager during Doncaster Rovers most successful era. At the same time he managed Northern Ireland, leading them to their most successful achievement reaching the quarter finals of the World Cup in 1958. He was in the first group of 22 players to be inducted into the English Football Players Hall of Fame.
Playing career.
Born in Magherafelt, County Londonderry, Doherty began his career with Glentoran in the Irish League. After helping Glentoran to the 1933 Irish Cup, early in the 1933–34 season Doherty joined English club Blackpool, at the age of 19. He scored 29 goals in 89 league appearances over three seasons. He joined Manchester City on 19 February 1936 for a then-club record of £10,000. Blackpool needed the money urgently, and Doherty was summoned from his lunch to report to Bloomfield Road. The Irishman tried hard to persuade Blackpool directors that he did not wish to leave the club, for he was due to marry a local girl and had just bought a new house in the town. The fee was an exceptionally high transfer fee for the period; it came within £1,000 of the British record. Doherty's Manchester City debut, against Preston North End, was not a successful one. Tightly man-marked by Bill Shankly throughout, he failed to make an impact, leading to one catcall from the crowd of "Ten thousand pounds? More like ten thousand cigarette cards". Doherty later described the remainder of his first Manchester City season as "uneventful", but his second was to be anything but.
Manchester City started the 1936–37 season poorly, and were in the bottom half of the table until December. Occasional big wins, including a 6–2 defeat of West Bromwich Albion and a 4–1 defeat of Everton, were mixed with extended barren runs; at one point the club gained just one win in twelve matches. However, Doherty was scoring goals regularly. A goal in a 5–3 Christmas day loss to Grimsby Town was his twelfth of the season. Christmas proved to be a turning point for the club, as a win against Middlesbrough the following day was the start of a long unbeaten run. By April, Manchester City were second in the table, and faced a fixture against Arsenal, league leaders and the dominant club of the period. Doherty scored the first goal in a 2–0 win, and City reached the top of the table. The unbeaten run continued until the end of the season, and City secured their first league championship with a 4–1 win over Sheffield Wednesday. Doherty, with 30 league goals, was the club's leading scorer, helped by a run of eleven goals in seven games as the season drew to a close.
Doherty scored 81 goals in 133 league appearances during his time at Maine Road. During the Second World War years of 1939–1945, Doherty served in the RAF. He remained registered as a Manchester City player, scoring 60 goals in 89 wartime matches, though wartime games are not generally included in official records. He also guested for numerous clubs across the country: Port Vale, Blackburn Rovers, Derby County, Birmingham, Brentford, Grimsby Town, Lincoln City, Liverpool, Manchester United, West Bromwich Albion and Walsall. During a guest appearance for Port Vale in 1945, he famously went to take a penalty but instead of shooting he laid it off to a team mate who scored.
After the conclusion of the war, he transferred to Derby County, with whom he won the FA Cup, scoring a goal in the final itself. He also went on to play for Huddersfield Town, scoring 33 goals in 83 league appearances.
In his autobiography, Len Shackleton wrote of Doherty:
Management career.
He made his final move to Doncaster in 1949, where he assumed the role of player-manager. He later became manager of Northern Ireland (1951–1962), for whom he had 16 caps as a player. He led the country to the 1958 World Cup, reaching the quarter-finals. He also managed Bristol City.
His coaching techniques were revolutionary at the time. He emphasised ball practice and instead of endless laps of the pitch, Doherty suggested volley-ball, "to promote jumping, timing and judgement"; basket-ball, "to encourage split-second decision-making and finding space"; and walking-football, "to build up calf muscles".
Later life saw him become a scout for Liverpool, helping to unearth such talents as Kevin Keegan.
Honours and awards.
Doherty won a league championship medal with Manchester City in 1937 and a cup winner's medal with Derby in the 1946 FA Cup Final.
He was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002.
Following his death in 1990, there is a plaque to mark his birthplace in Magherafelt. It can be found at what is now a barber shop.

Computer-assisted orthopedic surgery

Computer-assisted orthopedic surgery or computer-assisted orthopaedic surgery (sometimes abbreviated as "CAOS") is a discipline where computer technology is applied pre-, intra- and/or post-operatively to improve the outcome of orthopedic surgical procedures. CAOS is an active research discipline which brings together orthopedic practitioners with traditionally technical disciplines, such as engineering, computer science and robotics.
The principal idea behind CAOS is that operative outcomes will be improved through the use of computer technology. Taking the example of joint replacement, the task of the surgeon is to integrate the new joint components into the patient's existing anatomy; CAOS technologies allow the surgeon to:-
It has not yet been proved that CAOS technologies result in a significant long-term improvement in operative outcome. Whilst the surgeon (or even medical students in laboratory studies ) can achieve better results in terms of planned vs. achieved placement of components, it is not clear whether the plan has been constructed optimally. Further, because of the functional adaptability of bone, errors in component placement may become unimportant in the long term. Because of the relatively short time period over which CAOS has developed, long-term follow-up studies have not yet been possible.
With CAOS, the surgeon can more accurately pinpoint anatomical landmarks that might be hard to see in a small incision. This navigation system then guides the surgeon through different bone cuts and finally to implantation. Computer-assisted orthopedic surgery is mostly used in knee implant surgery because of the precision the surgeon get with femoral and tibial bone cuts. It is also used to navigate acetabular components placement where correct cup inclination is crucial.
Computer-assisted orthopedic surgery is a system where a computer interacts with body parts via infrared lights and gate detectors. There are systems that require C-Arm images or CAT scans, flourabased systems and the newest and most evolved systems are imageless systems, this means that no pre scans of any kind are necessary. The imageless systems are far less complicated, are lower cost and more patient friendly since the pre scans are not necessary. The imageless systems will also bring down operation time. The negative aspect of imageless systems is that they might be less accurate, this is yet to be proven.

<doc id="2845914" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2845914" title="Securities lending">
Securities lending

In finance, securities lending or stock lending refers to the lending of securities by one party to another. The terms of the loan will be governed by a "Securities Lending Agreement", which requires that the borrower provides the lender with collateral, in the form of cash, government securities, or a Letter of Credit of value equal to or greater than the loaned securities. The agreement is a contract enforceable under relevant law, which is often specified in the agreement. 
As payment for the loan, the parties negotiate a fee, quoted as an annualized percentage of the value of the loaned securities. If the agreed form of collateral is cash, then the fee may be quoted as a "short rebate", meaning that the lender will earn all of the interest which accrues on the cash collateral, and will "rebate" an agreed rate of interest to the borrower. Key lenders of securities include mutual funds, insurance companies, pension plans and other large investment portfolios. 
Securities lending is an important means of eliminating "failed" transactions as well as enabling hedge funds and other investment vehicles to sell shares short.
Market size.
Until the start of 2009 Securities Lending was only an over-the-counter market, so the size of this industry was difficult to estimate accurately. According to the industry group ISLA, in the year 2007 the balance of securities on loan globally exceeded £1 trillion.
An example.
In an example transaction, a large institutional money manager with a position in a particular stock would allow those securities to be borrowed by a financial intermediary, typically an investment bank, prime broker or other broker-dealer, acting on behalf of one or more clients; after borrowing the stock, these clients could sell it short. The short seller would like to buy the stock back at a lower price (which would create a profit). Once the shares are borrowed and sold, it generates cash from selling the stock. That cash would become collateral for the lender. The cash value of the collateral would be marked-to-market on a daily basis so that it exceeds the value of the loan by at least 2%. 
Often a bank serves as the lending agent, receiving the cash collateral and investing it until it must be returned. The income from the reinvested cash collateral is divided by paying the borrower a rebate and then dividing the remaining amount between the securities lender and the agent bank. This allows major investment funds to earn incremental income on their portfolio holdings. Where the lender is a pension plan, the transaction may need to comply with various exemptions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
Legalities.
Securities Lending is legal and clearly regulated in most of the world's major securities markets. Most markets mandate that the borrowing of securities be conducted only for specifically permitted purposes, which generally include;
When a security is loaned, the title of the security transfers to the borrower. This means that the borrower has the advantages of holding the security, as they become the full legal and beneficial owner of it. Specifically, the borrower will receive all coupon and/or dividend payments, and any other rights such as voting rights. In most cases, these dividends or coupons must be passed back to the lender in the form of what is referred to as a "manufactured dividend".
The initial driver for the securities lending business was to cover settlement failure. If one party fails to deliver stock to you it can mean that you are unable to deliver stock that you have already sold to another party. In order to avoid the costs and penalties that can arise from settlement failure, stock could be borrowed at a fee, and delivered to the second party. When your initial stock finally arrived (or was obtained from another source) lender would receive back the same number of shares in the security they lent. 
The principal reason for borrowing a security is to cover a short position. As you are obliged to deliver the security, you will have to borrow it. At the end of the agreement you will have to return an "equivalent" security to the lender. Equivalent in this context means "fungible", i.e. the securities have to be completely interchangeable. Compare this with lending a ten euro note. You do not expect exactly the same note back, as any ten euro note will do.
As a result of Regulation SHO, adopted by the SEC, short sellers typically must either possess the shares they are selling short or have a right to obtain them in order to cover the short sale. 
Securities lenders.
Securities lenders, often simply called sec lenders, are institutions which have access to 'lendable' securities. This can be asset managers, who have many securities under management, custodian banks holding securities for third parties or third party lenders who access securities automatically via the asset holder's custodian. The international trade organization for the securities lending industry is the International Securities Lending Association. According to a June 2004 survey, their members had euro 5.99 billion worth of securities available for lending. In the US, the Risk Management Association publishes quarterly surveys among its (US based) members. In June 2005, these had USD 5.77 billion worth of securities available. 
Typical borrowers include hedge funds and the proprietary trading desks of investment banks.
Term in investment banking.
In investment banking, the term "securities lending" is also used to describe a service offered to large investors who can allow the investment bank to lend out their shares to other people. This is often done to investors of all sizes who have pledged their shares to borrow money to buy more shares, but large investors like pension funds often choose to do this to their unpledged shares because they will receive interest income. In these types of agreements, the investor still receives any dividends as normal, the only thing they cannot generally do is to vote their shares.
Term in private securities-collateralized lending.
The term "securities lending" is sometimes used erroneously in the same context as a "stock loan" or individual "securities-collateralized loan". The former refers to the actual lending typically of banks or brokerages to other institutions to cover short sales or for other temporary purposes. The latter is used in private or institutional securities-backed loan arrangements across a wide spectrum of securities. In recent years, FINRA has cautioned all consumer to avoid nonrecourse transfer-of-title stock loans, but they enjoyed a brief popularity before the SEC and IRS came to shut almost all such providers down between 2007-2012, reclassifying nonrecourse transfer-of-title title stock loans as fully taxable sales at inception (See FINRA advisory link below). Today, it is widely accepted that the only legally valid consumer lending programs involving stocks or other securities are those in which the stocks remain in the client's title and account without sale through a fully licensed and regulated institution with membership in the SIPC, FDIC, FINRA and other mainline regulatory organizations, with their own audited financial statements. These are usually in the form of securities-based credit lines. 
Other alternatives include working with a reputable provider of securities loans willing to provide references, track record of successful transactions completed, and process of funding the loans and returning the collateral. In 2011, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) issued an investor alert on stock-based loan programs. In the alert, FINRA recommended investors ask several questions, including: 1) What happens to my stock once I pledge it as collateral? (FINRA states that securities should never be sold to fund the loans); 2) Does the lender have audited financials? (FINRA noted that any publicly traded major brokerage/bank that reports will need to have audited financial data available for investors); and 3) Is the institution managing the loan and accounts fully licensed and in good standing?
Currently such institutional credit line programs are available only through long-standing depository relationships with institutional brokerages and their banking arms, and typically come with large depository minimums. However, there are a few securities-based credit line programs currently available in the general market that allow access at competitive rates and terms without such advance depository or client relationships, and these can be easily found by searching on Google with "credit line no title transfer or sale to fund" or similar terms.

Black Elk Wilderness

The Black Elk Wilderness is located in the U.S. state of South Dakota. The wilderness was designated by an act of Congress in 1980. Managed by the U.S. Forest Service, Black Elk Wilderness is part of Black Hills National Forest. This 13,426 acre (54 km²) region is considered sacred to Native Americans, especially the Sioux and is named after Black Elk, an Oglala Sioux holy man. Mount Rushmore National Memorial is immediately to the north and much of the rest of the wilderness is bordered by other protected land under the jurisdiction of state and federal agencies.
Harney Peak, which at 7,242 feet (2,207 m) is the tallest mountain in South Dakota, is located in the wilderness, and one can see into four different states from the summit. Craggy peaks and rocky slopes mixed with ponderosa pine, spruce and fir trees make for a varied ecosystem. Mountain goats and bighorn sheep inhabit the more rugged mountain slopes, while mule deer, elk and pronghorn are more common in the forested valleys. A sizeable population of hawks and falcons also inhabit the wilderness.
U.S. Wilderness Areas do not allow motorized or mechanized vehicles, including bicycles. Although camping and fishing are allowed with proper permit, no roads or buildings are constructed and there is also no logging or mining, in compliance with the 1964 Wilderness Act. Wilderness areas within National Forests and Bureau of Land Management areas also allow hunting in season. By 2010, 80 percent of the trees in the wilderness had been killed by the Mountain pine beetle.

USS Drayton (DD-366)

USS "Drayton" (DD-366) was a "Mahan"-class destroyer in the United States Navy before and during World War II. She was the second ship named for Captain Percival Drayton.
"Drayton" was launched 26 March 1936 by the Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine; sponsored by Miss B. E. Drayton, great-grandniece of Captain Drayton, and commissioned 1 September 1936, with Commander R. G. Pennoyer in command.
Service history.
After her shakedown cruise to Europe from 6 October to 5 December 1936, "Drayton" underwent final trials and acceptance. Then sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, 6 June 1937 to join the Scouting Force at San Diego, California, 19 June. On 4 July she got underway to take part in the fruitless search for the lost aviator Amelia Earhart, participating in maneuvers at Pearl Harbor before her return to San Diego 30 July. For the next two years, "Drayton" exercised along the west coast, in the Hawaiian Islands, and in the Caribbean.
"Drayton"s homeport from 12 October 1939 was Pearl Harbor. With war raging in Europe and tension increasing in the pacific, "Drayton" joined in the constant exercises and tactical problems preparing the fleet for action.
World War II.
Underway as plane guard for in TF 12 when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, "Drayton", with the force returned to Pearl Harbor 13 December 1941 after searching for Japanese raiders. Between 24 December 1941 and 7 January 1942, she escorted a convoy to Christmas Island, making two attacks on submarines en route. Four days later she got underway in the screen of for an air strike on Bougainville on 20 February, returning to Pearl Harbor on the 24th. After screening a tanker to Suva Harbor, Fiji Islands, "Drayton" sailed for the United States 25 March and arrived at San Pedro, California, 5 April. She joined in training exercises and patrol duty on the west coast until 1 August 1942.
"Drayton" sailed from Pearl Harbor 17 November 1942 for action in the Solomon Islands. She sortied from Espiritu Santo 29 November with TF 67 to intercept a Japanese naval force guarding transports en route to reinforce Guadalcanal. That night, the American ships battled a determined Japanese force off Tassafaronga. When the action was over, "Drayton" picked up 128 survivors, including the commanding officer from , and returned to Espiritu Santo 2 December. "Drayton" continued to operate in the Solomons campaign, bombarding Munda, New Georgia, and protecting transports bound for the Russell Islands. She escorted the unladen transports to Wellington, New Zealand, then returned to Noumea 7 March 1943 for exercises and patrol with TF 64.
"Drayton" sailed from Nouméa 13 May 1943 as escort for a transport convoy and arrived at Townsville, Australia 4 days later. Through the summer, she escorted Australian transports carrying troops from Townsville to Milne Bay for the lengthy fighting on vast New Guinea. "Drayton" patrolled and gave fire support during the invasion landings at Lae on 4 September and bombarded Finschhafen on 22 September.
After brief overhaul at Brisbane, Australia, "Drayton" returned to the New Guinea area, escorting transports to Arawe, New Britain, for the landings of 15 December, and covered the marine landings near -Cape Gloucester 26 December. She screened high-speed transports from Buna Roads to the invasion of Saidor 2 January, and aside from a brief voyage to Sydney to replenish, remained on patrol and escort duty for the occupation of the Bismarck Archipelago.
"Drayton" carried troops for the invasion of Los Negros Island in the Admiralty Islands. Here she joined in the bombardment 29 February 1944 and remained to provide fire support. She returned with reinforcement troops from Milne Bay 4 March and began operating as headquarters for the Landing Craft Control Officer for the Admiralties. "Drayton" bombarded Pityilu Island 12 March then sailed for Seeadler Harbor, Manus, escorting an LST convoy before returning to New Guinea.
The destroyer got underway from Milne Bay, New Guinea, 22 March 1944 and escorted transports to Canton Island on her way to the west coast. Following an overhaul at San Francisco, California, "Drayton" trained out of Pearl Harbor before arriving at Eniwetok 8 August. For the next 2 months she patrolled off Maloelap, Wotje, Jaluit, and Mille—bypassed Japanese-held atolls in the Marshall Islands.
"Drayton" reported to the 7th Fleet at Humboldt Bay, New Guinea, on 20 October 1944; 5 days later, she got underway for patrol and escort duty in newly invaded Leyte Gulf, where she arrived 29 October. Her service in this operation included a voyage to New Guinea to bring back transports laden with reinforcements. On 6 December while screening a convoy of LCMs and LCIs to San Pedro Bay, "Drayton" was attacked by a twin-engine bomber which scored a near miss, killing two and wounding seven of the destroyer's crew. The next day she repulsed a group of strafing planes before they could damage her charges, and later the same morning engaged 10 or 12 enemy fighters. One aircraft crashed into the No. One 5 inch gun mount, killing 6 and wounding 12 men. "Drayton" extinguished her fires and carried out her mission, convoying her charges safely to harbor and then sailing unassisted to Manus, New Guinea for repairs.
Her repairs completed, "Drayton" sailed from Manus 26 December 1944 for the invasion of Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, 9 January 1945. She gave fire support until the 13th, then sailed to San Pedro Bay to escort a support convoy to the beachhead. From 27 January to 18 February, she served on patrol and gave fire support, bombarding enemy troops in the foothills and destroying a strong point in a cave.
Continuing to operate in the Philippines, "Drayton" participated in the landings at Mangarin Bay, Puerto Princesa, Cebu, Ormoc Bay, and Masbate City.
On 23 April 1945, "Drayton" stood out of San Pedro Bay for the invasion of Borneo, screening the actions at Tarakan from 1 to 27 May and at Balikpapan from 1 to 21 July. Returning to Manila 29 July, she got underway 7 August, and arrived at New York 12 September.
"Drayton" was decommissioned 9 October 1945 and sold for scrap 20 December 1946.
Awards.
"Drayton" received 11 battle stars for World War II service.

Kodak DCS 300 series

The Kodak DCS 300 series comprised two cameras, the DCS 315 and DCS 330. They were professional-level digital SLR cameras built by Eastman Kodak's Kodak Professional Imaging Solutions division. They were based on the Nikon Pronea 6i APS SLR camera and were aimed at a lower price point than other models in the Kodak DCS range. The 1.5 megapixel DCS 315 was launched in 1998, while the 3 megapixel DCS 330 was launched in 1999.
The DCS 315 was the first digital SLR camera to incorporate an image preview LCD and inbuilt JPEG processing.
The two cameras had different sized CCD imaging chips, both of which were smaller than either 135 film or APS-C film frames. The 315's imager had a crop factor of 2.6 relative to 135 film ("35mm"), while the 330's was larger with a factor of 1.9.
The Kodak modification to the Pronea 6i involved removing the camera's film back and mounting instead a Kodak digital back. This not only covered the back of the camera, but also extended beneath it, approximately doubling the camera's height. This was required to accommodate the large PC cards used as storage media, the six AA batteries required to power the camera, and the circuitry for image processing. The Kodak back had two display screens. The upper was a full-color screen used for viewing taken shots. The lower LCD displayed the camera's settings.
An infrared filter was mounted just behind the lens mount. This had to be removed in order to fit certain Nikkor lenses, including the IX-Nikkor lenses designed for the APS format camera.
The DCS 315 was substantially faster than the 330 since only half as much data needed to be stored per shot. The 315 also allowed image storage in the smaller JPEG format, while the 330 only allowed Kodak's proprietary .TIF RAW format.

Ayr Scottish Eagles

The Ayr Scottish Eagles were a professional Scottish ice hockey club, from Ayr, Scotland. They were formed in 1996 and played their home games at the Centrum Arena. The team competed in the Ice Hockey Superleague and the club's main (title) sponsor was Barr Construction. The club folded during the 2002-03 season after a move to Braehead Arena.
History.
The Ayr Scottish Eagles were founded in 1996 and played in the Ice Hockey Superleague. The team quickly rose to become one of the top teams in the United Kingdom, due in part to achieving the in their second season (1997–98) winning all four major UK ice hockey trophies, these were the British Championship, Superleague, the Autumn Cup and Express Cup. Also in 1998 they achieved great success (for a British team), when they twice defeated Ak Bars Kazan in the European Hockey League.
2002-03.
In August 2002, it was announced by owner Bill Barr that the team were to permanently relocate to the Braehead Arena in Renfrewshire, outside Glasgow.
Bob Zeller, Belfast Giants founder was announced as managing director and the team changed their name to "Scottish Eagles", dropping "Ayr" from their name. Bob Zeller remained a shareholder in the Belfast Giants. The reason given for the relocation was due to the Braehead Arena having a larger seating capacity and a larger catchment area, expected to increase the fanbase of the club.
The club (with the new name) folded on 14 November 2002, after just six home games, in what was to become the final season of the British Ice Hockey Superleague.
Post demise.
Friends of Eagles Hockey, organised an exhibition match at the Centrum Arena on 4 February 2003 as a fund raising event to raise funds for players and officials who had been left in financial difficulty due to the bankruptcy of Ice hockey Services Ltd, the Eagles operating company.
Friends of Eagles Hockey, campaigned for the return of ice hockey to the Centrum Arena after the Eagles's demise. Ice rink operators Planet Ice showed an interest in running the Centrum as an ice arena; however the arena was demolished in 2009 and the site is now home to a new supermarket.
Braehead Clan.
The Braehead Clan ice hockey club are now based at the Braehead Arena and play in the Elite Ice Hockey League. In their first season, there was an effort to recruit former Ayr Scottish Eagles fans to the Clan support. Ayr Scottish Eagles fans who held a season ticket at Braehead in the 2002-03 season that was cut short due to the team folding were offered a season ticket in Braehead's first season.
Although the Scottish Eagles and Braehead Clan were both based at the Braehead Arena, this is where the link between the two Ice Hockey Clubs ends. The Scottish Eagles were operated by Ice Hockey Services Ltd which underwent a Voluntary Members Liquidation and was wound up on 23 June 2005. Braehead Clan is operated by Clan Entertainment Ltd that was Incorporated on 3 February 2010.
Home arenas.
The original home of the Eagles was the Centrum Arena. It was officially opened on 25 August 1996 and was run by Barr Leisure Limited, a subsidiary of Barr Holdings Ltd. The Eagles played their first home game there on 1 September 1996.
After an announcement by Bill Barr, the Eagles moved to the Braehead Arena for the 2002-03 season, where they played just six home games before folding. The Centrum was still used as a training venue throughout this period.
Rosters.
The Ayr Scottish Eagles won all four major trophies in the 1997-98 season, known as the "Grand Slam", the first team ever to do so during the existence of the British Super League.
The final game played by the Ayr Scottish Eagles was an exhibition match at the Centrum arena that consisted of an all-star team against a UK select all-star team. The match officials were referee Moray Hanson and linesmen Alan Craig and Rab Cowan.

Observatory Road

Observatory Road (天文臺道) is one of the oldest roads in Hong Kong, and has existed since 1883. It is called so because this is where the Hong Kong Observatory was constructed. The Observatory is still in operation and provides updated typhoon information and other services for the Northwest Pacific area.
Observatory Road is located in the Tsim Sha Tsui area of the Kowloon Peninsula and is about 200 metres in length. Despite its relatively short length, however, it is a significant historical area especially since some buildings from the old era still stand alongside the newer imposing structures of modern Kowloon. The road runs uphills and downhills on the Observatory Hill.
Observatory Road connects to Chatham Road South at one end and Nathan Road at the other. The part of the Road crossing the Hong Kong Observatory compound is not open to the public. Among the other familiar places around this area are the Hong Kong Museum of History, the Science Museum, Energy Plaza with its Clock Fountain, Miramar Shopping Centre, Ramada Hotel, and of course, the Hong Kong Observatory itself.

Riepl's law

Riepl's law is a hypothesis formulated by Wolfgang Riepl in 1913. It is frequently cited in discussions about newly emerging forms of media in the scientific community in German-speaking countries.
Riepl, the chief editor of Nuremberg's biggest newspaper at the time, stated in his dissertation about ancient modes of news communications (original title: "Das Nachrichtenwesen des Altertums mit besonderer Rücksicht auf die Römer") that new, further developed types of media never replace the existing modes of media and their usage patterns. Instead, a convergence takes place in their field, leading to a different way and field of use for these older forms.
This hypothesis is still considered to be relevant, explaining the fact that new media never make the "old" media disappear.

A traffic tower is a permanent raised structure providing a clearer view of traffic conditions than can be had from street level and protection for the traffic controller from the hazards of moving vehicles.
Some traffic towers are fitted with manually operated lights and/or signals. Other traffic towers rely on handsignals to direct traffic. In some cases, traffic towers offer a central control location for lights at more than one intersection.
Many traffic towers have been replaced by automated traffic lights. Many remaining traffic towers are significant landmarks and have been retained or moved to other locations as historic structures.
The last remaining traffic tower in the United Kingdom is in Bicester, Oxfordshire.

Erskineville railway station

Erskineville railway station is part of the Sydney Trains network. Located in the Sydney suburb of Erskineville, it services a residential area. 
Physically, Erskineville lies on the Illawarra railway line, although only Bankstown Line trains currently stop there with all other services passing through. The station has six platforms (two of which are incomplete), with 2 side and 2 island, which retain their original brick platform buildings. There is currently no wheelchair access.
History.
The original station, situated on the north side of Erskineville Road (then called Swanson Street), opened on 15 October 1884 with the construction of the Illawarra railway line to Hurstville. A new station, constructed on the south side of the overbridge, was opened on 16 June 1912. The lines through Erskineville were quadruplicated on 15 June 1913 with the current arrangement of platforms. Historically, trains on all three lines stopped at Erskineville, now currently served only by Bankstown line services. Erskineville and its neighbouring station, St Peters, were serviced by all-station East Hills trains until around 1990.
Immediately north of Erskineville, the "Illawarra relief lines" (from the Eastern Suburbs line) emerge from underground to join the "Up and Down Illawarra lines" (the eastern-most pair of tracks). This connection opened in 1979. The two westernmost platforms are incomplete and lack tracks. They were originally built at the time of the construction of the Eastern Suburbs line in the 1970s when the alignment between Sydenham and Erskineville was expanded to accommodate 6 tracks. However, this was abandoned as a cost-cutting exercise, and the never completed platforms remain unused to date. The Clearways Project previously envisaged reviving this plan, with stopping trains serving only the newly completed western platforms. However, this project was cancelled in November 2008.
Platforms and services.
Currently only Bankstown Line trains stop at Erskineville- 
As of the new Sydney Trains timetables on Sunday the 20th of October 2013:
on weekdays the station is served by four trains per hour in each direction for most of the day, with additional trains provided during peak hours;
and on weekends the station is served by four trains per hour in each direction for most of the day.

Miki Berenyi

Miki Berenyi (born 18 March 1967) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and guitarist of mixed Japanese and Hungarian parentage. Her mother, Yasuko Nagazumi was a Japanese actress who played minor roles in the James Bond movie "You Only Live Twice" and in TV-series "". Berenyi was the singer and guitarist in the alternative rock band Lush.
Music.
At the age of 14, Berenyi met her friend and future bandmate, Emma Anderson. They became interested in music and together wrote a music fanzine "Alphabet Soup" (which only lasted for five issues). Berenyi first played bass with the band, The Bugs, and later went on to play with Lillies. "In 1988, Berenyi studied English literature at the North London Polytechnic, where she met drummer Chris Acland, bassist Steve Rippon, and singer Meriel Barham. Along with Anderson, they decided to form their own band. When Meriel Barham left, "the remaining members of Lush placed ads in local papers looking for Barham's replacement, but they couldn't find the singer they wanted, and Berenyi took over the vocals".
From 1988 until 1996, she played with Lush, releasing several albums, singles and videos, and toured extensively through the UK, North America, Japan, Australia and other countries.
Lush officially announced their breakup in February 1998, following the suicide of drummer Chris Acland in October 1996.
After Lush split, Berenyi appeared on The Rentals 1999 album "Seven More Minutes". She also contributed vocals to a remix of a Flat 7 track by Robin Guthrie (who also produced Lush's early work), and appeared on the debut album of Eric Matthews's Seinking Ships, "Museum Quality Capture", released in 2010.
When asked if she missed anything about her time in Lush, she stated, "I miss the excitement and energy of playing live and the camaraderie of touring—being with the band and crew in a foreign country is like going on holiday with your mates but even more fun because it’s free." "I enjoyed being in the band immensely, I’m glad I did it."
She currently works for a magazine as a sub-editor and no longer performs, explaining "I was never a proper guitarist—only in the context of Lush. I played the guitar to write songs on and to play live."
Personal life.
As of 2013, Berenyi was living in northwest London with her partner K.J. "Moose" McKillop and two children. McKillop was a member of the band Moose, which took its name from his nickname.

Iron(III) phosphate

Iron(III) phosphate is the inorganic compound with the formula FePO4. Several related materials are known, including four polymorphs of FePO4 and two polymorphs of the dihydrate FePO4·(H2O)2. These materials find several technical applications as well as occurring in the mineral kingdom.
Structure.
The most common form of FePO4 adopts the structure of α-quartz. As such the P and Fe have tetrahedral molecular geometry. At high pressures, a phase change occurs to a more dense structure with octahedral Fe centres. Two orthorhombic structures and a monoclinic phase are also known. In the two polymorphs of the dihydrate, the Fe center is octahedral with two mutually cis water ligands.
Uses.
Iron(III) phosphate is one of the few molluscicides approved for use in the practice of organic farming. Unlike the older metaldehyde, it is non-toxic to pets and wildlife.
It can be used in steel and metal manufacturing processes. When bonded to a metal surface, iron phosphate prevents further oxidation of the metal. Its presence is partially responsible for the corrosion resistance of the Iron pillar of Delhi.
Iron phosphate coatings are also primarily used as base coatings for paint in order to increase adhesion to the iron or steel substrate, and is often used in rustproofing as well. It can also be used for bonding fabrics, wood, and other materials to these surfaces as well. Iron phosphate coatings are usually applied as part of a painting or powder coating process.
Iron phosphate can also be used as an intercalation electrode in a lithium-ion battery despite having low electronic conductivity. However, in recent years its use as an electrode material has been increasingly more common as materials engineers have overcome the electronic conductivity issue. FePO4 is an ideal electrode material for batteries in electric vehicles due to its thermal stability and generally good cyclability.
Legislation.
Iron(III) phosphate is not allowed as food additive in European Union. It was withdrawn from the list of allowed substances in the directive 2002/46/EC in 2007.
Safety.
Can cause eye, skin, and respiratory tract irritation. May be harmful if swallowed. Avoid inhalation of dusts.

Pen Llithrig y Wrach is a mountain peak in Snowdonia, North Wales. It is one of the four Marilyns that make up the Carneddau range. To the east is Creigiau Gleision, another Marilyn, while to the west is Pen yr Helgi Du and Carnedd Llewelyn. Craig Eigiau and Llyn Eigiau can be seen to the north, while Gallt yr Ogof, Glyder Fach and Tryfan can be viewed to the south. 
It has one of the more colourful names of any British mountain, translating as "slippery peak of the witch", perhaps in reference to the boggy conditions underfoot, or because of the resemblance of its pointed profile to an archetypal witch's hat. 
It is an outlier of the Carneddau, the higher peaks of which can be reached from Pen Llithrig y Wrach via Pen yr Helgi Du. On its eastern side, the mountain slopes steeply down to Llyn Cowlyd. 
It may be climbed from the southern side, from Capel Curig or the A5, or from the north-east, from Dolgarrog or Tal-y-bont in the Conwy valley. It is quite prominent when viewed from the north near Llandudno.

Petersham train station is frequently used by more than 600 students from Fort Street High School, especially between 8:00am and 8:30am and 2:30pm to 3:30pm (when school ends). Not all of these students use the train station itself, with many transiting to bus stops for Dulwich Hill and Marrickville. Trainees and other staff for the Transport For NSW Training College, which is located in a compound immediately to the south of the station and Petersham TAFE to the west also use the station.
History.
Petersham station opened in 1857. The heritage listed Victorian Italianate station built in 1885 in Terminus Street, with platform at rear, is the only major 'First Class' station building known to have been built in Sydney in the 19th century. The Main Suburban Railway Line through Petersham was quadrupled in 1892, and an island platform was built to serve both 'fast' and 'slow' pairs of tracks. The line was sextupled through Petersham in 1927 in association with electrification works and the island platform serving the old 'fast' pair of tracks (to become the 'Up' and 'Down Suburban' tracks) was demolished. An ornate station building stands to the north of the tracks, but is no longer used as part of the station, and is now used as extra training rooms for the TFNSW training college located on the opposite side of the tracks. A turn-back siding previously located between the local tracks has now been removed. This turn back siding was located on land now used for the training college.
A pedestrian subway was provided in 1892 at the western end of the station, connecting Trafalgar Street with Terminus Street. Access to the platforms from this subway closed after 1988. The footbridge remains a fascinating piece of neo-gothic architecture. Upgrades to the station took place in the late 1990s, with the wooden steps on the footbridge being replaced due to their slipperiness in wet weather, a small but high-roofed shed at the east end of the platform being removed for security reasons, and the area under the lower part of the platform stairs also being fenced-off for similar concerns.
Platforms and services.
As of the new Sydney Trains timetables on Sunday the 20th of October 2013: on weekdays the station is served by four trains per hour in each direction for most of the day, with additional trains provided during peak hours; and on weekends the station is served by four trains per hour in each direction for most of the day.

Keyboard (magazine)

Keyboard magazine is a magazine that originally covered electronic keyboard instruments and keyboardists, though with the advent of computer-based recording and audio technology, they have added digital music technology to their regular coverage, including those not strictly pertaining to the keyboard related instruments.
Over the years, the print and online editions of the magazine have moved into discussions on anything related to gear by companies like Korg, Roland, and Yamaha, and their latest projects. The editors and writers of the magazine have covered historical information and stories on the development of keyboards from their inception with pioneers like Moog Music. At times, editorial and guest articles in the magazine have covered subjects including music philosophy and keyboarding instruction, music theory and harmonics.
It is not uncommon to find advertisements and endorsements for high tech audio gear and computer hardware and software within the pages of the two editions.

Treaty of Bucharest (1916)

The Treaty of Bucharest of 1916 was signed between Romania and the Entente Powers on 4 (Old Style)/17 (New Style) August 1916 in Bucharest. The treaty stipulated the conditions under which Romania agreed to join the war on the side of the Entente, particularly territorial promises in Austria-Hungary. The signatories bound themselves to keep secret the contents of the treaty until a general peace was concluded.
Negotiations.
In 1915 Lieutenant-Colonel Christopher Thomson, a fluent French speaker, was sent to Bucharest as British military attaché on Kitchener's initiative to bring Romania into the war. But when there he quickly formed the view that an unprepared and ill-armed Romania facing a war on three fronts against Austria-Hungary, Turkey and Bulgaria would be a liability not an asset to the allies. This view was brushed aside by Whitehall, and he signed (with foreboding) a Military Convention with Romania on 13 August 1916. Thompson became head of the British Military Mission.
Treaty.
The treaty had two parts: a political treaty (seven articles) and a military convention (seventeen articles). The Romanian government was to declare war on Austria-Hungary—in accordance with the stipulations in the military convention—on August 28 (new style) the latest, and according to the political treaty, in exchange it was to receive the following territories: 
The exact borders stipulated by the treaty were those of prewar Romania (Article I) plus those it was allowed to annex from Austria-Hungary, up to a line of demarcation described in Article IV:
In article IV Romania also bound itself not to construct fortifications opposite of Belgrade, and to indemnify
Serbs from Banat for their properties if they emigrated from Romania in the two years following the conclusion of peace.
In Article V of the political convention, the signatories promised not to make separate peace, and also bound Great Britain, France, Italy and Russia to let Romania annex the territories from article IV at an eventual Peace Treaty. The Entente also guaranteed Romania equal rights with its allies at the Peace Conference in article VI of the political treaty. Article VII bound the signatories to maintaining secrecy of the convention until a general peace was signed. 
The military convention stated that Romania was to attack Austria-Hungary from the south, while Russia committed itself to start an offensive on the Austrian front in order to support the Romanian advance into Transylvania. Also the Russian High Command promised to send two infantry divisions and one cavalry division into Dobruja to protect the rear of the front from a Bulgarian attack. The French and the British pledged to start an offensive on the Thessaloniki front in order to force Bulgaria out of the war.
Romania enters the war.
In the morning of 14/27 August, a Crown Council was held at the Cotroceni Palace, convened by King Ferdinand. The Council decided to honor the Treaty with the Entente Powers, and on 27 August, Romania declared war on Austria-Hungary, and launched three armies of 440,000 men the same night across the passages of the Southern Carpathians. 
The advance of the Romanian Army was unopposed, as Austria-Hungary did not station considerable forces along the Romanian border. By mid-September, however, the attack was halted, as German-Bulgarian troops advanced into Dobruja and threatened to outflank the Romanian Army from the south-east. 
In October the Romanian Army was pushed out of Transylvania with the help of German reinforcements. By the end of 1916 the capital Bucharest fell—along with Wallachia and Dobruja—under the control of Central Powers and the Romanian government retreated to Iași. Thompson, now head of the British Military Mission, had to alleviate the consequences of Romania’s capitulation, and he personally supervised the destruction of the Romanian oil wells to deny them to Germany.
In 1917, the Romanian Army recovered and succeeded to stop the German attempts to break the front, in spite of the disintegration of the Russian Army after the February Revolution. The toll of the campaign was approximately 220,000 dead for Romania, but in the end it gained Transylvania, two-thirds of the Banat, Bukovina and Bessarabia.

Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Kingdom of the Netherlands

The Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Kingdom of the Netherlands ("Evangelisch-Lutherse Kerk in het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden") was a denomination in the Netherlands which under that name existed from 1818 to 2004. In 2004, the denomination became a part of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands, which is the continuation of the Dutch Reformed Church, the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands and the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
The first Lutheran congregations in the Netherlands were founded in the 16th century, but an organized 'Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Kingdom of the Netherlands' did not come into being until 1818. The city of Amsterdam was, and still is, the centre of Dutch Lutheranism. Most Lutherans in the Netherlands are descendants of German or Scandinavian merchants, and the Lutheran church has always been quite small.
Because of the urban and internationally oriented membership of the Lutheran Church, liberal influences have always been relatively strong. The church was always counted among the most liberal denominations in the Netherlands. They were among the first churches to ordain women and open homosexuals.
On May 1, 2004, the Lutheran Church's membership was down to a mere 14,000 when it merged with the Dutch Reformed Church and the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands to form the Protestant Church in the Netherlands.

Rollcage (video game)

Rollcage is an arcade-style racing game for Windows and PlayStation, developed by Attention to Detail, and published by Psygnosis. The Windows version was released in the UK on March 24, 1999. The game's selling point was its unique physics engine, in which cars could drive on walls or ceilings because of the airflow passing over them at extreme speeds. The game also featured an original soundtrack by Fatboy Slim and also featured the song ""Love Island"" from the album You've Come A Long Way, Baby. 
The game received very positive reviews and ratings.
Overview.
Rollcage allows players to race as one of six cars and drivers. The drivers are Tony, Lothar, Ria, Jet, Leon and Lenny. When the game is completed in "Easy" mode the "Hard" mode and a seventh mysterious driver (who now can race against you) are unlocked. Completing "Hard" mode allows players to race as the seventh driver (a policeman named Yuri). He arguably has the best statistics in the game due his car's higher speed, grip, and acceleration and strength. The cars are all double sided so, they can be driven on either side. This is done by having the tires of the car larger than the body. The cars cannot be destroyed in the game.
The racing modes available to choose from are: League, Arcade, Time attack and Multiplayer.
Tracks.
There are four main "Worlds" in Rollcage, each with up to four tracks; Neoto City, Harpoon Islands, Sapphire Springs and Outworld.
Weapons and power-ups.
There are many weapons and power-ups in the game, and they are an integral part of the game. If used carefully, weapons and power-ups can help a lot during racing. There are two slots for weapons in the game so at any one time, the player can have two weapons, and they can be the same type.
Music.
Rollcage features licensed music from Fatboy Slim, E-Z Rollers, Pressure Rise, Aphrodite, Ashley Beedle, Organized, Hoax, Les Rosbifs, Ratman, Danmass, Ed Rush & Nico, Pascal and Freestyles. Psygnosis released a special Limited Edition 2-Disc version of Rollcage, which included a CD soundtrack featuring 12 licensed tracks from the game. In addition, the Playstation game is an Audio Accessible disc, which includes all 15 music tracks and can be played in normal CD Audio Players.
Sequels.
A sequel named "Rollcage Stage II" was released in 2000 for Windows and PlayStation. The sequel includes 20 vehicles and a lot more tracks than the first game, and it's more accessible to novice players. There is also a training mode, a combat mode and multiplayer (up to four players split screen or more players on the internet or LAN). The game Firebugs by ATD can also be considered a continuation of the Rollcage concept. [http://www.gorcx.net/forum/index.php/topic,204.0.html]
A fanmade sequel, ReCaged, is currently in development.
Multiplayer.
The Rollcage game supports multiplayer over TCP/IP games. A way to play Rollcage through the Internet is to use softwares like Tunngle.
Since the beginning of 2014, a weekly game has been set on Tunngle every Saturday at 09:00 pm GMT +2 for both Rollcage and Rollcage Stage II

Knightriders

Knightriders (also known as "George A. Romero's Knightriders") is a 1981 film written and directed by George A. Romero. It was filmed entirely on location in the Pittsburgh metro area, with major scenes in suburban Fawn Township and Natrona. The film is a change of pace for Romero, known primarily for horror films; it is a personal drama about a travelling renaissance fair troupe.
Summary.
Billy (Ed Harris) leads a traveling troupe that jousts on motorcycles. "King William", as he styles himself, tries to lead the troupe according to his Arthurian ideals. However, the constant pressure of balancing those ideals against the modern day realities and financial pressures of running the organization are beginning to strain the group. Billy is also plagued by a recurring dream of a black bird. Tensions are exacerbated by Billy's constantly pushing himself despite being injured and the arrival of a promoter named Bontempi (Martin Ferrero), who wants to represent the troupe.
After Billy spends a night in jail watching a member of his troupe beaten because Billy has refused a payoff to a corrupt local cop, Billy returns to the fairground where the troupe is next to perform and is shocked that some members want to join with the promoter. His sense of betrayal is heightened when his queen, Linet (Amy Ingersoll), admits that her feelings for him may not be the reason she remains with the troupe.
Things come to a head after Morgan (Tom Savini), leader of the dissident faction who believes he should be king, wins the day's tournament and a melee breaks out between the troupe and rowdy members of the crowd. Billy faces an Indian rider (Albert Amerson) with a black eagle crest on his breast plate, the black bird of his dreams. Billy defeats the Indian but aggravates his injury. Morgan and several other riders leave the troupe to follow Bontempi. Billy's loyal supporter Alan (Gary Lahti) also departs with his new lady friend Julie (Patricia Tallman) and friend Bors (Harold Wayne Jones) to try to sort out his emotions. Billy and the remainder of the troupe settle at the fairground to await the dissidents' return.
A minor subplot deals with troupe member Pippin (Warner Shook) coming to terms with his homosexuality and finding love with Punch (Randy Kovitz). Another subplot deals with Alan's girlfriend, Julie, who runs away from home to escape her alcoholic and abusive father and her weak-willed mother. While Alan is soul searching, he realizes Julie is using him as an escape and that he really desires Billy's Queen Linet. Alan takes a confused and hurt Julie home to her parents.
Meanwhile, Morgan's riders succumb to infighting. Alan finds Morgan and helps him realize that there can only be one king and that he cannot simply leave and establish his own kingdom. Morgan and his riders return to challenge for the crown. In a pitched battle between Morgan's forces and Billy's, led by Alan, Morgan is victorious. Billy crowns him king and Morgan crowns the woman he now realizes he loves, Angie (Christine Forrest), a grease monkey young woman who works as the head mechanic for the troupe, as his queen. Morgan tells the promoter to tear up the contracts. Linet finds succor, with Billy's blessing, with Alan.
Billy leaves the troupe, accompanied by the Indian, and returns to thrash the crooked cop as he had earlier vowed. While riding again, Billy, weak and hallucinatory from loss of blood from his injury, is struck and killed by a truck. The entire troupe gathers at Billy's funeral to say farewell to its fallen friend and king.
Production notes.
Stephen King (and his wife Tabitha) have a 20 second cameo.
George Romero has claimed the medieval hobbyist organization, the Society for Creative Anachronism, to be one inspiration for the film.
A shorter cut of the film (running 102 minutes) was released in Europe.
Reception.
The film was received by positive reviews earning 75% from Rotten Tomatoes according to 8 reviews and earned an average score of 6.1.
Soundtrack.
The film score by Donald Rubinstein was released on Perseverance Records in 2008.

A Rumāl (Punjabi: ਰੁਮਾਲ) is a piece of clothing similar to a handkerchief or bandana. It is worn by Sikh men who cut their hair and other male guests when they are in a Gurdwara. Covering the head is respectful in Sikhism and if a man is not wearing a turban, then a rumāl must be worn before entering the Gurdwara. 
In most Gurdwaras, there is often a basket of rumāls outside for welcoming in more guests. If there are no rumāls supplied by the Gurdwara then a clean and plain handkerchief is the most suitable cloth to use.
Rumāl for non-Sikhs.
Outside the context of Sikhism, a rumāl is simply the Hindi, Nepali and Bengali word for handkerchief, and will be understood as such. Its association with Sikhism is not implied.
Rumāl weapon.
It was used by the Thugees in India as a method of strangulation. A coin was knotted in one end of the scarf, and it could be swung around the neck of the victim; who would then be strangled in the most brutal and abhorrent manner, to kill the victim in honour of the goddess of Death and Love, Kali. In the 1970s television series Dad's Army, Corporal Jones attempts to strangle Captain Ramsey in the episode "We Know Our Onions".

Broadwater Farm

Broadwater Farm, often referred to simply as "The Farm", is an area in Tottenham, North London, straddling the River Moselle. The eastern half of the area is dominated by the Broadwater Farm Estate ("BWFE"), an experiment in high-density social housing built in the late 1960s. The western half of the area is taken up by Lordship Recreation Ground, one of north London's largest parks.
The area acquired a reputation as one of the worst places to live in the United Kingdom following the publication of Alice Coleman's "Utopia on Trial" in 1985, a perception made worse when serious rioting erupted later that year. However, following a major redevelopment programme crime rates have dropped dramatically with a burglary rate of virtually zero. It is also one of the most ethnically diverse locations in London; in 2005 its official population of 3,800 included residents of 39 different nationalities.
Location.
Broadwater Farm is situated in the valley of the Moselle, approximately six miles (10 km) north of the City of London. It is situated in a deep depression immediately south of Lordship Lane, between the twin junctions of Lordship Lane and The Roundway. It is immediately adjacent to Bruce Castle, approximately 547 yards (500 m) from the centre of Tottenham, and 1.2 miles (2 km) from Wood Green.
History.
Early history.
Until the opening of the nearby Bruce Grove railway station on 22 July 1872 the area was still rural, although close in proximity to London and the growing suburb of Tottenham. Aside from a small group of buildings clustered around neighbouring Bruce Castle, the only buildings in the area were the farmhouse and outbuildings of Broadwater Farm, then still a working farm.
Following the construction of the railways to Tottenham and Wood Green, development in the surrounding area took place rapidly. However, due to waterlogging and flooding caused by the River Moselle, Broadwater Farm was considered unsuitable for development and remained as farmland. By 1920, Broadwater Farm was the last remaining agricultural land on Lordship Lane, surrounded by housing on all sides.
In 1932 Tottenham Urban District Council purchased Broadwater Farm. The western half was drained and converted for recreational use as Lordship Recreation Ground, while the eastern half was kept vacant for prospective development and used as allotments. Heavy concrete dikes were built to reduce flooding of the Moselle in Lordship Recreation Ground, whilst on the eastern half of the farm the river was covered to run in culvert as far as Tottenham Cemetery.
The Broadwater Farm Estate.
In 1967, construction of the Broadwater Farm Estate began on the site of the allotments, and an area of the south eastern part of the park was used to replace the allotments destroyed by the building of the estate. As initially built, the estate contained 1,063 flats, providing homes for 3,000–4,000 people. The design of the estate was inspired by Le Corbusier, and characterised by large concrete blocks and tall towers.
Because of the high water table and the flood risk caused by the Moselle, which flows through the site, no housing was built at ground level. Instead, the ground level was entirely occupied by car parks, and the buildings were linked by a system of interconnected walkways at first floor level known as the "deck level". Shops and amenities were also located on the deck level.
The 12 interconnected buildings were each named after a different World War II RAF aerodrome. The most conspicuous buildings are the very tall Northolt and Kenley towers, and the large ziggurat shaped Tangmere block.
Deterioration.
By 1973, problems with the estate were becoming apparent; the walkways of the deck level created dangerously isolated areas which became hotspots for crime and robbery, and provided easy escape routes for criminals. The housing was poorly maintained, and suffered badly from water leakages, pest infestations and electrical faults. More than half of the people offered accommodation in the estate refused it, and the majority of existing residents had applied to be re-housed elsewhere. In 1976, less than ten years after the estate opened, the Department of the Environment concluded that the estate was of such poor quality that the only solution was demolition. This decision was unwelcome to residents, and relations between the community and the local authority became increasingly confrontational. A process of regeneration began in 1981, but it was hampered by a lack of funds and an increasingly negative public perception of the area.
"Utopia on Trial".
By the time that Alice Coleman's critique of 1960s planned housing, "Utopia on Trial", was published in 1985, the estate was regarded as being representative of unsuccessful large-scale housing projects. When a major exhibition by Le Corbusier in the mid-1980s proved unable to attract sponsorship, the refusal of sponsors to be associated with his name was attributed to the "Broadwater Farm factor".
The book's criticism of alleged "lapses of civilised behaviour" on Le Corbusier inspired estates, claiming that residents of such buildings were far more likely to commit and to be victims of anti-social behaviour, were highly influential on the Thatcher government. Although the book focused on Tower Hamlets and Southwark and did not in fact cover Broadwater Farm, by the time of the book's publication the estate was becoming synonymous with this style of estate, and the government began to put pressure on Haringey London Borough Council to improve the area.
The Tenants' Association and the Youth Association.
Although the demographics of Broadwater Farm at the time were roughly 50% black and 50% white, the Tenants' Association was all white and regarded with increasing distrust by black residents and white residents not connected with the Association. In 1981, residents set up the rival "Youth Association", which was widely applauded by many members of the local black community for challenging the perceived harassment by the controversial Special Patrol Group of local youths and of black residents of the estate. In 1983, the council gave the Tenants' Association an empty shop to use as an office and a vague authority to "deal with local problems", heightening antagonism between the Tenants' Association and Youth Association, which in turn set up its own youth club, advice centre, estate watchdog and local lobbying group.
Early regeneration projects.
Despite the lack of funds and unwillingness on the part of the council to commit to regeneration, by 1985 it appeared that progress was being made in solving the area's problems. Pressure from the Tenants' Association and the Youth Association forced the council to open a Neighbourhood Office. In 1983, a tenants' empowerment agency, Priority Estates Project, was appointed to coordinate residents' complaints and concerns, and residents were included on interview panels for council staff dealing with the area.
The Broadwater Farm riot.
Background to the riot.
There had been earlier riots in Brixton and in Handsworth in Birmingham, which were indicative of a period of rising racial tension, during which some police methods such as raids, saturation policing and stop and search tactics increased the frustration of some members of the black community.
Floyd Jarrett, whose home was about a mile from the Farm, was arrested by police on 5 October 1985, having given false details when stopped with an allegedly false tax disc. While he was in custody, four officers attended his home to conduct a search. During the search, his mother Cynthia Jarrett collapsed and died. It has never been satisfactorily concluded how and why Cynthia Jarrett died, and whether it was a heart attack or due to police actions.
Murder of PC Keith Blakelock.
At 6.45 pm a police van answering a 999 call to Broadwater Farm was surrounded and attacked. As further police officers made their way to the area, rioters erected barricades on the deck level and the emergency services withdrew from the deck level. At 9.30 pm fire broke out in a newsagent on the deck level of the Tangmere block. Firefighters attempting to put out the fire came under attack, and police attended to assist them. As the situation escalated, police and firefighters withdrew. In the withdrawal, PCs Keith Blakelock and Richard Coombes became separated from other officers. A group of around 40 people attacked them with sticks, knives and machetes, leading to PC Blakelock's death and serious injuries to PC Coombes. As news of the death spread, the rioting subsided. Local council leader Bernie Grant claims to have been misquoted as saying that "What the police got was a bloody good hiding".
Three local residents, Mark Braithwaite, Engin Raghip and Winston Silcott, were convicted of PC Blakelock's murder. However, three years later their convictions were overturned when it was discovered that police notes of their interviews had been tampered with. The person or persons guilty of the murder have never been identified. But in 2010, a man was arrested on suspicion of murdering PC Blakelock.
Reconstruction.
After the events of 1985, Broadwater Farm became the focus of an intensive £33 million regeneration programme in response to the problems highlighted by the riots. The all-white Tenants Association was restructured more accurately to reflect the community, and residents' concerns seriously addressed by the authorities. A local management team was brought in to oversee improvements to the estate and to collect rents and enforce regulations, instead of continuing to attempt to run the estate centrally from Haringey Council's central offices. The deck level was dismantled and the overhead walkways demolished, with the shops and amenities relocated to a single ground-level strip of road to transform the semi-derelict Willan Road into a "High Street" for the area. The surrounding areas were landscaped and each building redesigned to give it a unique identity. A network of council-run CCTV cameras was installed to monitor the streets and car parks, and each building staffed by a concierge to deter unwanted visitors. Two giant murals were painted which now dominate the area, one of a waterfall on the side of Debden block and one depicting Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, John Lennon and Bob Marley on Rochford block. Disused shops left empty following the withdrawal of businesses after the riots were converted into low-cost light industrial units to provide employment opportunities for residents and prevent capital from flowing out of the area. Since the redevelopment, the flow of people leaving the estate has slowed to a trickle, and there is now a lengthy waiting list for housing.
Crime rates.
Since the regeneration, Broadwater Farm now has one of the lowest crime rates of any urban area in the world. In the first quarter of 2005, there was not a single reported robbery or outdoor assault on Broadwater Farm, and only a single burglary, from which all property was recovered and the suspect arrested; this compares with 875 burglaries, 50 robberies and 50 assaults in the third quarter of 1985 immediately preceding the riot. In an independent 2003 survey of all the estate's residents, only 2% said they considered the area unsafe, the lowest figure for any area in London. The estate also has the lowest rent arrears of any part of the borough.
In 2005 the Metropolitan Police disbanded the Broadwater Farm Unit altogether as no longer required in an area with such a low crime rate.

Bruce Castle, once the home of Rowland Hill, inventor of the postage stamp, is on the north side of Lordship Lane immediately opposite Broadwater Farm. It was built by William Compton in the 16th century, and has been a public museum since 1906. It houses the public archives of Haringey Council, as well as a large display on the history of the postal system.
Broadwater Farm is home to the Broadwater United football coaching programme. Set up in the aftermath of the events of 1985 with the intention of providing a focus for local youths, it has subsequently produced a number of professional footballers, including Jobi McAnuff, Lionel Morgan and Jude Stirling, son of the programme manager Clasford Stirling.

In 2007 a new Children's Centre opened on the estate, with nursery places for 104 children. It is considered one of the best designed nursery schools in the world, and won the Royal Institute of British Architects's Award for 2007.
Broadwater Farm contains three primary schools, the general Broadwater Farm Primary School and the Moselle and William C Harvey schools for pupils with special needs. An ongoing programme is underway to integrate the three schools onto a single campus. Secondary education is provided by nearby Woodside High School, formerly named White Hart Lane School, approximately 200m outside the Broadwater Farm area.
Shops.
Following the riots, many shops in Broadwater Farm withdrew from the area, and those that remained closed following the demolition of the deck level. Broadwater Farm is consequently extremely poorly served by shops. Haringey Council has provided 21 small "enterprise units" at a deliberately low cost to entice firms to open in the area, but these have proved hard to fill. However, Broadwater Farm is only 400m from the shops and supermarkets of Tottenham High Road, and approximately 2 km from the Shopping City supermall at Wood Green.
Transport.
Due to the waterlogged ground and lack of population prior to the containment of the Moselle, Broadwater Farm was bypassed by the Underground. Bruce Grove railway station, 400m east of the estate, connects the area to central London. Because of the narrow streets, double-decker and bendy buses are unable to serve the area. From 11 February 2006 the W4 route, which utilises Alexander Dennis Enviro200 Dart to navigate the narrow streets and sharp bends, was diverted to run into the estate, providing direct public transport links for the first time. A number of other bus routes run along Lordship Lane, immediately to the north and Philip Lane to the south. Turnpike Lane tube station is within walking distance to the south west.
Demographics.
There are currently between 3800 and 4000 residents of Broadwater Farm. Following the events of 1985 a number of local residents left and were replaced mainly by recent immigrants, particularly Kurds, Somalis and Congolese. In 2005, approximately 70% of residents were from an ethnic minority background and 39 different languages were spoken on the estate.

Harris Park railway station

Harris Park is a railway station on the Main Western railway line and is served by trains of the Western Line and Cumberland Line on Sydney's Sydney Trains network. It has four tracks and two island platforms. It serves the well-established residential area of Harris Park and is very close to the major interchange station at Parramatta.
Harris Park is the 122nd most patronised railway station in Sydney (out of a total of 176 stations), with an average of 1580 passengers boarding per day.
History.
Harris Park station opened in the late 1800s. Originally built as two side platforms, both were rebuilt as island platforms during the quadruplication of the Granville to Westmead line in the 1980s. In 1996 the Harris Park to Merrylands 'Y-Link' tracks opened allowing direct train operation between these two stations by what is now known as the Cumberland Line.
On 30 June 2013, a landslide occurred due to heavy rain, burying west-bound train tracks and partially covering platform 4, causing delays on the Western Line to Emu Plains/Richmond.
Platforms and services.
The station is served by two trains per hour each way, with additional trains during weekday peak hours.

Likasi (formerly official names: Jadotville (French) and Jadotstad (Dutch)) is a city in Katanga Province, in the south-east of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Climate.
Likasi has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: "Cwa").
Demographics.
Likasi has a population of around 447,500 (2012). During the 1990s the United Nations set up feeding centres and refugee centres in and around Likasi to assist with the refugees fleeing ethnic violence in Shaba, whose arrival had increased the population of the town some 41,000.
History.
In 1961, during the United Nations intervention in the Katanga conflict, a company of Irish UN troops deployed to Jadotville was forced to surrender to troops loyal to the Katangese Prime Minister Moise Tshombe (see Siege of Jadotville).
Economy.
Likasi remains a centre for industry, especially mining, and is a transport hub for the surrounding region. There are mines and refineries supplied by nearby deposits of copper and cobalt.
There is also an abandoned gold mine in Likasi, which has been drained of its gold but is still dug by artisanal miners.
Transport.
Likasi is served by a station on the national railway system. The trains are mostly cargo trains and not passenger trains.

<doc id="2846153" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2846153" title="Meter Point Administration Number">
Meter Point Administration Number

A Meter Point Administration Number, also known as MPAN, Supply Number or S-Number, is a 21-digit reference used in Great Britain to uniquely identify electricity supply points such as individual domestic residences. The gas equivalent is the Meter Point Reference Number. The system was introduced in 1998 in order to provide a competitive environment for the electricity companies, and allows consumers to switch their supplier easily as well as simplifying administration. Although the name suggests that an MPAN refers to a particular meter, an MPAN can have several meters associated with it, or indeed none where it is an unmetered supply. A supply receiving power from the network operator (DNO) has an Import MPAN, while generation and microgeneration projects feeding back into the DNO network are given Export MPANs.
Structure.
An MPAN is commonly separated into two sections: the core and the supplementary data. The core is the final 13 digits and is the unique identifier. The supplementary data gives information about the characteristics of the supply and is the responsibility of the supplier.
The full MPAN is required to be depicted on electricity bills (the boxes on the top and bottom line are generally unaligned):
The core data is on the second line, the supplementary data on the first.
Profile Class (PC).
The first two digits of a full MPAN reflect its profile class.
Profile class 00 supplies are half-hourly (HH) metered, i.e. they record electricity consumption for every half hour of every day, and supplies of the other profile classes are non-half-hourly (NHH) metered. A NHH supply must be upgraded to HH for:
HH data is recorded by the meter and will be collected usually be either an onsite download, or via a GSM, SMS, GPRS or telephone line.
Domestic NHH import MPANs will always have a profile class of 01 or 02. Domestic NHH export MPANs are allocated a profile class of 08.
Meter Time Switch Class (MTC).
The MTC is a 3 digit code that reflects the various registers a meter may have, whether it be a Single Rate, Day Night split, or even a Seasonal Time of Day.
Line Loss Factor Class (LLFC).
The Line Loss Factor Class or LLFC is used to calculate the related Distribution Use of System (DUoS) charges for the MPAN. The figure reflects both the amount of distribution infrastructure used to supply the exit point and the amount of energy lost through heating of cables, transformers, etc.
Core.
The MPAN core is the final 13 digits of the MPAN, and uniquely identifies an exit point. It consists of the two-digit Distributor ID, followed by an eight-digit unique identifier, then by two digits and a single check digit.
Distributor ID.
Great Britain is divided into 14 distribution areas. For each area a single company, the distribution network operator, has a licence to distribute electricity. They effectively carry electricity from the National Grid to the exit point (each has a unique MPAN and a possibility of several meters) where the customers are. The owner of the distribution network charges electricity suppliers for carrying the electricity in their network. Their DNO licensed regions are the same geographic areas as the old nationalised electricity boards.
In addition to the Distribution Network Operators noted above who are licensed for a specific geographic area there are also Independent Distribution Network Operators (IDNO). IDNOs own and operate electricity distribution networks which are mostly network extensions connected to the existing distribution network, e.g. to serve new housing developments. Scottish Hydro Electric Power Distribution also provide distribution services in South Scotland as an IDNO and Southern Electric Power Distribution provide IDNO services in all other England and Wales areas. There are five IDNOs with no "base" area and these are detailed in the table below:
Check Digit.
The final digit in the MPAN is the check digit, and validates the previous 12 (the core) using a modulus 11 test. The check digit is calculated thus:
MPAN state.
The supply identified by the MPAN can exist in one of three states: disconnected, de-energised, live.
These terms are by no means standardised. For example, a disconnected supply might be referred to as a 'dead' supply.
Export MPANs.
The vast majority of MPANs are import MPANs, used where energy is being consumed. However, if a supply exports to the distribution network, then an export MPAN is issued. If a supply both imports and exports, then both an import MPAN and export MPAN are issued.
Microgeneration.
Formerly, export MPANs required a half-hourly compliant meter to be installed. Since 2003, it has been possible for microgeneration projects, with a capacity of 30 kW or below to have a non-half-hourly meter, to export back into the distribution network. The uptake was slow with the first microgeneration export MPAN being issued in June 2005. Some suppliers may not bother to register the export MPAN in MPAS as the revenue is so small. Export capacity over 30 kW is required to be half hourly metered.
Metered Supply Point.
The Metered Supply Point (MSP) is the point at which the meter measuring a customer's consumption is located. It is thus also the point at which the Distribution Network Operator's supply cable terminates, and the customer's equipment begins. In order to firmly establish a supply's MSP, the MPAN needs to be associated with a meter serial number.
Although it is common for an MPAN to be associated with one meter serial number, in some cases there is a many-to-many relationship. For example, one meter could be associated with both an import and an export MPAN, or one MPAN could be measured by three separate meters.
Unmetered supplies.
It is possible for small predictable supplies to be Unmetered. Typical Unmetered Supplies are Street Lights, Traffic Signals, Signs & Bollards. But can also include Telephone Kiosks, CCTV & Advertising Displays.
For a piece of equipment to be connected to the Distribution Networks via an Unmetered Connection it should not exceed 500watts and operate in a predictable nature and cannot be manually turned on at the end users request, typically the equipment would either be in operation and taking a supply of electricity 24hrs a day or be controlled by a Photocell. A Photocell is most commonly used with Street Lights and is the small dome unit which can be seen on the very top of the lighting column.
It is the customer's responsibility to maintain an accurate and up-to-date inventory of Unmetered Supplies, and to inform the UMSO (UnMetered Supplies Operator) of all changes to the connected equipment.
Larger local authorities tend to trade their Unmetered energy on a Half Hourly basis. To do so, they employ a Meter Administrator who will use daily data from a Pecu Array which is then used to calculate the energy consumptions.
A PECU Array is a device that holds a representative account of the Photocells that Authority uses on their Street Lights or Traffic Signals they operate, there are many different types of Photocell (Electronic Photocell, Thermal and Hybrid for example) that can be used. Until 2014, the process of retrieving data from the PECU Array relied on the Meter Administrator using the LAMP or Lailoken equivalent meter programs, or for the Local Authority who own the Array to use the Ganieda software. The Array only held a limited amount of data in its 'rolling barrel' data log. For this reason it was important that whichever software was used, it had to be downloaded daily to avoid the risk of losing event data. In June 2014, ICTIS (UK) Ltd launched the PECU Array 2.0, which stores all its data off the array, in the cloud. Not only did this provide an unlimited data store, but it made it possible for the PECU Array owners to have direct and immediate access to their data via a dedicated website. It also enabled Lailoken retrieve the event data more efficiently and reduce the overall processing time for the Meter Administrators.
By trading energy as Unmetered Half Hourly the Authority will accurately pay for the energy consumed by their declared Unmetered Equipment, and because the data is downloaded daily the Authorities will see their energy invoices change throughout the year to represent the changes in season and daily lighting levels.
Once the daily calculations have been performed by the Meter Administrator the new revised energy consumption are sent to the appointed Data Collector who will in turn provided them to the appoint Electricity Supplier who invoices the Customer for the electricity used.
If however the Unmetered Supplies are being traded as Non Half Hourly the UMSO undertakes the responsibility to calculate an EAC (Estimated Annual Consumption), this is done using a simple formula which takes into account the Circuit Watts of the Equipment and the Annual Hours of Operations.
For example, a piece of equipment that is in use 24hrs per day will have annual hours of 8766. If we say a CCTV Camera is rated at 24 Circuit Watts and operating 24/7 the EAC would be 210.384kWh, the calculation is Circuit Watts x Annual Hours Divided by 1000 = Kilowatt Hours (kWh).
Example 24 x 8766 / 1000 = 210.384kWh, 1kWh is a Unit of Electricity.
If the equipment if Street Lighting the same process is used however the Annual Hours will change as each Photocell is assigned a set number of Annual Hours which indicate how and when the lights turn on & off. These Annual Hours have been set by Elexon and are not locally agreed with the UMSO by the customer.
Once an EAC calculation has taken place an EAC Certificate is provided to the customer's appointed Electricity Supplier for billing, with an electronic copy of the EAC being sent to the appointed Data Collector.
The UMSO does not make a charge to the Unmetered Customer which is why an appointed Supplier invoices for the electricity consumptions, however the DNO (for whom the UMSO is part of) do levy a charge to the electricity supplier for the delivery of the electricity to the customer's Unmetered equipment. These are known as DUoS charges (Distribution Use of System).
The electricity supplier pays a DUoS Charge based on the information held by the Data Collector for settlement purposes.
Meter Point Administration System.
Each DNO operates a Meter Point Administration System (MPAS) which holds the following information for each MPAN:
MPRS is the name of the software package that implements the MPAS system for all DNOs. Since MPRS is used by most DNOs it is often used interchangeably with the term MPAS.
ECOES.
ECOES is a website that allows authorised industry parties to search for supply details (past and present) using such things as the 13-digit MPAN bottom line number, the meter serial number or the postcode. There is no public access. The user can determine a wide range of data relating to the supply including the full address, meter details, the current energisation status and also the appointed parties (i.e. the supplier, distributor, MOP, DC and DA). The site is populated from information sent from the supplier regarding the metering system.

451 Patientia

451 Patientia is a minor planet of the asteroid belt with a diameter of 225 km, making it one of the larger asteroids in the belt. It was discovered by French astronomer Auguste Charlois on December 4, 1899 and assigned a provisional designation 1899 EY.
It regularly reaches 11th magnitude in brightness, as in January 11, 2013 and December 12, 2017 when in favorable oppositions will be at magnitudes 10.7 and 10.4 respectively, very bright for a later-discovered minor planet.
Multiple photometric studies of this asteroid were performed between 1969 and 2003. The combined data gave an irregular light curve with a synodic period of 9.730 ± 0.004 hours and a brightness variation of 0.05–0.10 in magnitude.

Medardo Rosso

Medardo Rosso (21 June 1858, Turin, Italy – 31 March 1928, Milan) was an Italian sculptor. He is considered, like Auguste Rodin, a Post Impressionism artist.
Biography.
Rosso was born in Turin, where his father worked as a Railway Station manager. When his family moved to Milan, Rosso started cutting classes to work as stone carvers, distressing his parents. At the age of 23, after a spell in the army, he enrolled at the Brera Academy, where he learned to draw classical statues and copy them in stucco. Rosso rebelled at the academic art lessons focused on classical statues, demanding instead that life models could be used for the drawing classes. He left the Academy and moved to Rome, where he lived in poverty. Angelo De Gubernatis, in his 1889 almanac of living artists, quotes assesses Rosso:
"(He) rebelled at each school, with each method, with each Academy, abhoring anything that smacks of trade, of artifice, soon found himself alone, without support, without master, without counselors, and with a bunch of captive and envious colleagues (who tripped him, when) he tried his way and to demonstrate his abilities, his ingenuity. But the Biblical (saying) "Go alone! did not frighten him, even in those long daily vigils struggling with a whole system which for many years had triumphed, despite the strong supporters of this and that opponent, he felt his strength increase, developed his talent, he conceived a vast new artistic horizons have not yet been attempted by others, and began to work and hold it to the test."
In 1882, Rosso produced his first impressionistic sculptures,"The Street Singer" and "Lovers under the Lamplight". In 1884 some friends arranged an exhibition for him in Paris, where he lived for a time in a cheap boarding-house. He also exhibited that year in Paris at the new Salon des Indépendants. He met Edgar Degas and Rodin. The sculptor and teacher Jules Dalou allowed him to work in his Paris studio.
In 1885 Rosso returned to Milan, but he never lost contact with Paris. He entered a competition in Milan for a funeral monument to the critic Filippo Filippi, and Rosso, who had quickly finished his entry, set it up on the grave without waiting for the judges' decision. In 1886 the writer Émile Zola bought a bronze by Rosso, who thereby gained a measure of celebrity. Rodin offered to exchange a torso of his own for Rosso's recent head of a laughing woman. Rosso's work, praised by Degas, always enjoyed greater esteem in France than in Italy.
Rosso's constant concern to translate into solid sculpture the transitory effects of light. So by means of rough, spontaneous modeling he manipulated light and shade in such a way as almost to produce the effect of color. In this process the distinctive characteristics of his material played an increasingly important part. A paraphrase of Gubernatis states: 
The rules of art, knowledge, culture, will benefit very well the proportions of a given work ...but will never tell you anything, or yield the most applause... or reveal the soul, the expression, the moment with the same truth that is presented to us at that time, under the impression given in the real world... (Rosso's) "Bersagliere" at the Paris Salon that is so loved, and so talked about in papers, is a successful head, there is truth, there is expression, there is color. For the artist, it all lies in knowing to choose the right moment to characterize the subject, and this divination, this deep feeling mixed with some knowledge of the "individual is the main talent of genius", the hallmark of his work . He is very keen to the idea, the concept. But for an artist to be truly worthy of that name, (he) must first be original. Having an ideas of art, attending one school rather than another, does not say anything. The important thing is to dig in and derive from your brain the first impression it receives of a work, and render them as you feel and receive them...Medardo Rosso is realist, but (only as a) realist that gives the enchanting beauty of nature, of feeling, of the heart, representing the vices and virtues, the beautiful and the deformed.
Rosso was able to maintain a studio in Paris and to hold a number of exhibitions. In 1896he exhibited at the Goupil Gallery in London. He also had a success in New York. Toward the end of his life he suffered from diabetes and developed cancer in a foot. He made few sculptures after 1900, and died after the amputation of the affected leg.

Fruit butter

A fruit butter is a sweet spread made of fruit cooked to a paste, then lightly sweetened. It falls into the same category as jelly and jam. Apple butter and plum butter are common examples. Fruit pastes, popular in Latin American countries, are similar but more highly sweetened and jelled. They are sold in shallow tins or as wrapped bricks, while fruit butters usually come in wide-mouthed jars.
The fruit is cooked at first, but not too much, as the fruit will burn and soon lose its sugary taste. However, if done right, the newly made fruit butter or paste can have a texture similar to dairy butter.

<doc id="2846192" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2846192" title="Scarman report">
Scarman report

The Scarman report was commissioned by the UK Government following the 1981 Brixton riots. Lord Scarman was appointed by then Home Secretary William Whitelaw on 14 April 1981 (two days after the rioting ended) to hold the enquiry into the riots. The Scarman report was published on November 25, 1981.
The terms of reference for the enquiry were "to inquire urgently into the serious disorder in Brixton on 10–12 April 1981 and to report, with the power to make recommendations".
The 1981 Brixton riots.
The riot took place in Brixton, London on 11 April 1981. At the time when Brixton underwent deep social and economic problems — high unemployment, high crime, poor housing, no amenities — in a predominantly African-Caribbean community. The Metropolitan Police began "Operation Swamp 81" at the beginning of April, aimed at reducing street crime, mainly through the heavy use of the so-called sus law, which allowed police to stop and search (and ultimately jail) individuals on the basis of a mere 'suspicion' of wrongdoing. Plain clothes police officers were dispatched into Brixton, and in five days almost 1,000 people were stopped and searched. The riot resulted in 299 injuries to police and 65 injuries to members of the public; over a hundred vehicles were burned, including 56 police vehicles; and almost 150 buildings were damaged, with 28 burned. There were 82 arrests. Reports suggested that up to 5,000 people were involved in the riot.
Evidence.
As part of the inquiry the following individuals and groups gave evidence: The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis (Counsel - Mr J Hazan QC and Mr L Marshall Concern), the Council for Community Relations of Lambeth, London Borough of Lambeth, Brixton local community groups and clubs, the Brixton Legal Defence Group, and the Commission for Racial Equality.
Findings and recommendations.
According to the Scarman report, the riots were a spontaneous outburst of built-up resentment sparked by particular incidents. Lord Scarman stated that "complex political, social and economic factors" created a "disposition towards violent protest". The Scarman report highlighted problems of racial disadvantage and inner city decline, warning that "urgent action" was needed to prevent racial disadvantage becoming an "endemic, ineradicable disease threatening the very survival of our society".
Scarman found unquestionable evidence of the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of 'stop and search' powers by the police against black people. The report details the use of arbitrary roadblocks, the stopping and searching of pedestrians and mass detention (943 stops, 118 arrests and 75 charges). "Operation Swamp 81" was conducted by the police without any consultation with the community or the home-beat officers. Liaison arrangements between police, community and local authority had collapsed before the riots and according to the Scarman report, the local community mistrusted the police and their methods of policing. Scarman recommended changes in training and law enforcement, and the recruitment of more ethnic minorities into the police force. According to the report "institutional racism" did not exist, but positive discrimination to tackle racial disadvantage was "a price worth paying".
Aftermath.
The theme of the Scarman report was broadly welcomed, accepted and endorsed by politicians, police commissioners, the press and community relations officials. Some of the report's recommendations were implemented. "Hard policing" continued and new measures were taken to create greater public trust and confidence in official institutions. Multi-agency and "soft" policing emerged through community consultation, youth and "race relations" services.
The Scarman report pushed the issue of law and order, and specifically policing, onto the mainstream agenda. The debate in the House of Parliament to mark the publication of the Scarman report on the 26 November 1981 had as its theme "law and order" and the then leader of the Liberal Party, David Steel, argued that "urgent action" to prevent a drift into lawlessness was necessary. A subsequent debate on March 1982 referenced the events of 1981 and focused on the impact of street violence, crime, decaying urban conditions, and the danger of "more violence to come" if changes in both police tactics and social policy were not swiftly introduced. While both the Conservative and Labour speakers in the parliamentary debate on the riots accepted the need to support the police, substantial disagreement centred around the issue of what role social deprivation and unemployment had in bringing young people to protest violently on the streets.
As a consequence of the Scarman report a new code for police behaviour was put forward in the "Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984"; and the act also created an independent Police Complaints Authority, established in 1985, to attempt to restore public confidence in the police.
"Community relations" and "institutional racism".
The Scarman report 
a shift from a concern about "race relations" to "community relations". According to Paul Rich, Lord Scarman's views expressed in the Scarman report most closely resembled that of the mid-Victorian era. Scarman was concerned with the "plight" of the ethnic communities in UK inner cities and their relationship with the rest of the national "community". He concluded that it was essential that "people are encouraged to secure a stake in, feel a pride in, and have a sense of responsibility for their own area". While the importance of community involvement in policing was recognised, the Scarman report pointed to "community redevelopment and planning" as the main area of concern. Scarman called for a policy of "direct coordinated attack on racial disadvantage". 
The Scarman report sought to locate the riots in the social, economic and political context of the acute deprivation in Brixton at the time. Lord Scarman identified the causes of the riots in the pathology of the Caribbean family, in the question of bilingualism amongst Asian children and in the undefined problem of policing a multi-racial society. In doing so Scarman highlighted what Robert Beckford has termed a "pathological image of Black youth". According to the report:
"Without close parental support, with no job to go to, and with few recreational facilities available the young Black person makes his life the streets and the seedy, commercially-run clubs of Brixton. There he meets criminals, who appear to have no difficulty obtaining the benefits of a materialist society."
The Scarman report does not apportion blame to the police. While the report acknowledges that "ill considered, immature and racially prejudiced actions of some officers" contributed to the riots Lord Scarman only acknowledges "unwitting discrimination against Black people". The report concludes that "The allegation that the police are the oppressive arm of a racist state not only display a complete ignorance of the constitutional arrangements of controlling the police, it is an injustice to the senior officers of the force." In his recommendations Scarman accepts that "hard" policing, such as stop and search operations, would be necessary in the future in areas characterised by severe social problems. Hence the Scarman report seeks to establish how policing could be enforced without provoking further outbreaks of disorder.
The 1999 Macpherson Report, an investigation into the murder of Stephen Lawrence, found that recommendations of the 1981 Scarman Report had been ignored. While the Scarman report concluded that "institutional racism" did not exist the Macpherson report concluded that the police force was "institutionally racist".

The WebMuseum, formerly known as the WebLouvre, was founded by Nicolas Pioch in France in 1994, while still a student. It is one of the earliest examples of a virtual museum. The site won the 1994 "Best of the Web" award for the "Best Use of Multiple Media". 
When the actual Louvre became aware of the original WebLouvre's existence, it was forced to change its name to the WebMuseum. However, many mirror sites were established throughout the world (including websites located in Brazil, Hungary, Japan, Mexico, Norway, Poland, Russia, UK and the USA), making it impossible to eradicate its existence. It still provides an excellent archival and educational resource of good quality art images and information, although it is no longer very actively updated.
Although this virtual museum is French in origin, it is available in English.

Aurelian Townshend

Aurelian Townshend (sometimes Townsend) (c. 1583 – c. 1649) was a seventeenth-century English poet and playwright.
Family.
Aurelian Townshend was the son of John Townshend of Dereham Abbey, Norfolk. Both Aurelian and his sister, Frances, were born before 12 December 1583, at which date they are mentioned in the will of Thomas Townshend of Crimplesham, Norfolk. Aurelian was a third cousin of Sir Roger Townshend and of the historian Hayward Townshend (c. 1577 – 1603×21).
Townshend's mother was named Anne, and is said to have been the daughter of Sir Richard Catlin.
Career.
Very little is well established about Townshend's life. He was one of the Cavalier poets, and his masque "Tempe Restored" was performed on Shrove Tuesday of 1632 and had in its cast Queen Henrietta Maria and fourteen court ladies.
Robert Cecil directed Aurelian's education and sent him to Europe to study. Within three years, Townshend was back in England. He then spent time in France as Edward Herbert's friend and aide who "spoke French, Italian and Spanish in great perfection," but this was for a year. In 1613, he became the librettist of Inigo Jones. He became a friend of Thomas Carew's, and wrote poetry for around five years. Carew referred to Townshend in his "In Answer of an Elegiacal Letter, upon the Death of the King of Sweden, from Aurelian Townshend, Inviting Me to Write on That Subject" (published in 1640), where he indicates that Townshend was more engaged in the political world than he.
From such heights as the court masque, Townshend rapidly fell. In 1643, he appears as "a poore and pocky Poet, (who) would bee glad to sell an 100 verses now at sixpence a piece, 50 shillings an 100 verses" before the House of Lords, seeking protection from creditors. The "pocky"-ness implies that, with his debts, Townshend had acquired disease (although not necessarily venereal disease). Other than these few facts, little can be sure.
According to Cokayne, Aubrey de Vere, 20th Earl of Oxford, married, as his second wife, shortly before 12 April 1673, Diana Kirke, daughter of George Kirke, 'the well known Groom of the Bedchamber', by his second wife, Mary Townshend, daughter of Aurelian Townshend. They had a son, Charles, who died as an infant, and with the death of the 20th Earl the heirs male of Aubrey de Vere, 10th Earl of Oxford, came to an end, 'and the earldom of Oxford, created in 1142, became extinct'.
Works.
Townshend's poetry is remarkably formal and simultaneously free. His language is delicate, and his lines musical. T. S. Eliot praised the musicality of Townshend's poetry, and Hugh Kenner argues that Townshend's mixture of formality and liberty set the stage for Andrew Marvell, while others consider him distinctly minor (e.g. Rumrich and Chaplin).

<doc id="2846227" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2846227" title="Arctic Climate Impact Assessment">
Arctic Climate Impact Assessment

The Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) is a study describing the ongoing climate change in the Arctic and its consequences: rising temperatures, loss of sea ice, unprecedented melting of the Greenland ice sheet, and many impacts on ecosystems, animals, and people. The ACIA is the first comprehensively researched, fully referenced, and independently reviewed evaluation of Arctic climate change and its impacts for the region and for the world. The project was guided by the intergovernmental Arctic Council and the non-governmental International Arctic Science Committee. Three hundred scientists participated in the study over a span of three years. 
The 140-page synthesis report "Impacts of a Warming Arctic" was released in November 2004, and the scientific report later in 2005.
The ACIA Secretariat is located at the International Arctic Research Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. 
Subsequent studies.
The "NOAA State of the Arctic Report 2006" updates some of the records of the ACIA report. Taken collectively, the observations presented in the NOAA report show convincing evidence of a sustained period of warm temperature anomalies in the Arctic, supported by continued reduction in sea ice extent, observed at both the winter maximum and summer minimum, and widespread changes in Arctic vegetation. The warming trend is tempered somewhat by shifts in the spatial patterns of land temperatures and ocean salinity and temperature. While there are still large region to region and multiyear shifts in the Arctic climate, the large spatial extent of recent changes in air temperature, sea ice, and vegetation is greater than observed in the 20th century. The NOAA report is a review of environmental conditions during the past five years relative to those in the latter part of the 20th century, conducted by an international group of twenty scientists who developed a consensus on information content and reliability.
As an annual follow-on activity to the 2006 NOAA State of the Arctic report, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's "Arctic Report Card" presents annually updated, peer-reviewed information on recent observations of environmental conditions in the Arctic relative to historical records. The conclusion for 2010 is that a return to previous Arctic conditions is unlikely. Record temperatures across Canadian Arctic and Greenland, a reduced summer sea ice cover, record snow cover decreases and links to some Northern Hemisphere weather support this conclusion.
In April 2008, the World Wildlife Fund's report, "Arctic Climate Impact Science – An Update Since ACIA" was launched at the meeting of the Arctic Council. It provides a large, updated review of Arctic climate impact science since the 2005 ACIA. The full report can be freely downloaded from the WWF web site.
Arctic Biodiversity Assessment.
ACIA called for improved capacity to monitor and understand changes in the Arctic and to improve and enhance long-term Arctic biodiversity monitoring. In response to this recommendation the Conservation of Arctic Flora & Fauna (CAFF) The Working Group of the Arctic Council has embarked upon the Arctic Biodiversity Assessment. The ABA will be used to identify gaps in the data record, identify the main stressors and key mechanisms driving change. It will synthesize existing data and research on Arctic biodiversity to form a baseline which will provide policy makers and conservation managers with a synthesis of the most current scientific research and traditional ecological knowledge. It will provide a much needed description of the current state of the Arctic’s ecosystems and biodiversity. The ABA will serve as a baseline for use in global and regional assessments of Arctic biodiversity and form a key piece in the process of understanding what is happening and focusing efforts on those areas where it is most needed. The availability of such information in an easily accessible format will be of great value to the governments, organisations, and peoples of the Arctic region in their struggle to ensure the sustainability of arctic biodiversity and arctic communities.
Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program.
In further response to the ACIA call for better monitoring CAFF has established the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program (CBMP). The CBMP is an international network of scientists, government agencies, Indigenous organizations and conservation groups working together to harmonize and integrate efforts to monitor the Arctic's living resources. Its goal is to facilitate more rapid detection, communication, and response with respect to the significant biodiversity-related trends and pressures affecting the circumpolar world. The CBMP is the cornerstone program of the Arctic Council's Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna Working Group.

Hoover free flights promotion

The Hoover free flights promotion was a marketing promotion begun in 1992. The British division of The Hoover Company was carrying a large surplus stock of washing machines and vacuum cleaners and in order to sell them and free up warehouse space, it promised free airline tickets to customers who purchased more than £100 worth of their products. However, what Hoover had not anticipated was that huge numbers of customers started buying Hoover products not because they wanted the actual appliances, but simply because they wanted the tickets. 
Initially the offer was for two round-trip tickets to Europe, but later it was expanded to the USA, at which point the consumer response increased enormously, as the normal price of these flights was several times more than the £100 purchase required to get free tickets. The company subsequently found itself overwhelmed by the demand for tickets (and even for new vacuum cleaners) and the cost of the flights.
History.
In 1993, the Hoover Holidays Pressure Group was formed, led by Harry Cichy and Sandy Jack, to protest that the company was not keeping its promises. Buying some shares in Hoover's owners, Maytag, the pressure group went to the Annual General Meeting of Maytag in Newton, Iowa. Sandy Jack expressed his concerns to the CEO of Maytag, Len Hadley. The presence of the group made headline news on ABC and the front cover of "The Des Moines Register". 
In 1994, Jack took Hoover to court over the free flight promotion. The BBC "Watchdog" programme's investigation of customer complaints about the promotion, by reporter Simon Walton and undercover researcher Hilary J Bell, brought the matter to even wider public attention.
The executives dismissed for their involvement are William Foust, Managing Director of Hoover Limited and President of Hoover Europe, and the two directors most closely involved with the promotion - Brian Webb, Hoover Vice-President of Marketing, and Michael Gilbey, Director of Marketing Services.
Result.
The court cases went on until 1998. After the fiasco had cost the company almost £50 million, the British division of Hoover was sold to the Italian manufacturer Candy.
Follow-up.
In 2004 a BBC documentary was made on the anniversary of Cichy and Jack's visit to Newton in 1994. Part of the "Trouble at the Top" series, the "Hoover Flights Fiasco" was watched by 1.7 million viewers.
Harry E. Cichy subsequently released a book of the incident, titled "Fighting The Corporation: The Hoover Flight Fiasco".

<doc id="2846247" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2846247" title="William S. Lind">
William S. Lind

William S. Lind (born July 9, 1947) is an American expert on military affairs and a pundit on cultural conservatism.
Education.
Lind graduated from Dartmouth College in 1969 and from Princeton University in 1971, where he received a Master's Degree in history.
Military expertise.
Alongside several U.S. officers, Lind is one of the originators of fourth-generation war (4GW) theory. This theory states that the state has effectively lost its monopoly on warfare, and seeks to address the new challenges posed by this situation. The root of this new phenomenon is the "State's Crisis of Legitimacy," which is also linked to Lind's work at the Center for Cultural Conservatism.
Lind served as a legislative aide for the armed services for Senator Robert Taft, Jr., of Ohio from 1973 through 1976 and held a similar position with Senator Gary Hart of Colorado from 1977 through 1986. He is the author of the "Maneuver Warfare Handbook" (Westview Press, 1985) and co-author, with Gary Hart, of "America Can Win: The Case for Military Reform."
With Bruce Gudmundsson, Lind hosted the program "Modern War" on the now-defunct satellite television network NET.
Lind, an opponent of the Iraq War, has written for the "Marine Corps Gazette", "Defense and the National Interest", (D-N-I.net), and "The American Conservative".
According to writer Robert Coram in his book "Boyd", during lectures on maneuver warfare Lind was sometimes criticized for having never served in the military, for having "never dodged a bullet, he had never led men in combat, he had never even worn a uniform and clearly spending way too much time playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare". Coram writes that when challenged by an officer, Lind "cut him off at the knees." (Coram 383)
Center for Cultural Conservatism.
Lind was formerly the Director of the Center for Cultural Conservatism at the Free Congress Foundation. He advocates a Declaration of Cultural Independence by cultural Conservatives in the United States, in the belief that the federal government ceased to represent their interests and began to coerce them into negative behavior and affect their culture in a negative fashion. The center believes that American culture and its institutions are headed for a collapse and that cultural Conservatives should separate themselves from the calamity that it foresees. It supports setting up independent parallel institutions with a right to secession and a highly decentralized nature that would rely on individual responsibility and discipline to remain intact, but would prevent the takeover of the institutions by those hostile to cultural conservatism's ideals.
Lind has authored and co-authored (with Paul Weyrich) a number of monographs on behalf of the Free Congress Foundation attempting to persuade American Conservatives to support government funding for mass transit programs, especially rail transit. He was Associate Publisher of a quarterly magazine called "The New Electric Railway Journal" from its launch in 1988 until 1996, and starting in January 1994 he also co-hosted a monthly program about light rail on the National Empowerment Television network; the program used the same name as the magazine.
As a paleoconservative, Lind has often criticized neoconservatives in his commentaries. While not an Anarchist, he has also written for LewRockwell.com. He is a self-proclaimed conservative and monarchist.
In his On War column of December 15, 2009, Lind announced that he was leaving the staff of the Center unexpectedly and that his series of On War articles was on hiatus for the moment. "Once I am re-established, either with a new institution or in retirement, I intend to re-start the column. When that will be I do not know. It also depends on obtaining connection to a telegraph line, which is not available everywhere."
However, he has recommenced his On War column with the "American Conservative" magazine.
Mr. Lind has started a new column on military affairs, "The View From Olympus," at TraditionalRight.com.
Criticism.
Bill Berkowitz, in an article for the Southern Poverty Law Center, described William Lind as the one person "who has done the most to define the enemies who make up the so-called 'cultural Marxists.'", being a leading proponent of the Frankfurt School conspiracy theory. According to the SPLC, in 1999 Lind wrote, "The real damage to race relations in the South came, not from slavery, but Reconstruction, which would not have occurred if the South had won."
Journalist Thomas E. Ricks in "The Atlantic Monthly" asserts that Lind's rhetoric differs from what Ricks calls "standard right-wing American rhetoric of the '90s" because Lind suggests that the "next real war we fight is likely to be on American soil."
Author Fareed Zakaria criticizes Lind in his book, "The Future of Freedom". On page 123, Zakaria states, "There are those in the West who agree with bin Laden that Islam is the reason for the Middle East's turmoil. Preachers such as Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell and writers such as Paul Johnson and William Lind have made the case that Islam is a religion of repression and backwardness."

Jimmy Logan

Jimmy Logan OBE, FRSAMD (4 April 1928 – 13 April 2001), born as James Allan Short, was a Scottish performer, producer, impresario and director.
Family.
Logan was born in Dennistoun, Glasgow, a member of a family of entertainers; the tradition began with his parents who were the music hall act, Short and Dalziel. His aunt, from whom he took his stage surname, was Broadway performer Ella Logan. His sister is actress and jazz singer Annie Ross, and his brother is vocalist Buddy Logan.
Career.
Educated at Gourock High School, Inverclyde, Logan left school at the age of 14. His family, in the 1930s and 1940s, toured the small music halls of Scotland and Northern Ireland. By 1944 he was in pantomime when he played the cat in "Dick Whittington and His Cat". His connection with pantomime continued throughout his life, most famously with the long-running pantomimes produced by Howard & Wyndham in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle and Aberdeen.
Jimmy Logan, starring with Jack Radcliffe and Eve Boswell, held the record number of performances of the famed "Five Past Eight" shows staged each summer at the Alhambra Theatre. Logan purchased the Empress Theatre for £80,000 in 1964. He refurbished it, re-opening it as the New Metropole. One of the first events to be staged there was the first Scottish production of the rock musical "Hair".
His first acting role was in the film "Floodtide" (1949), a drama set on Clydeside. He also performed in "Mary Poppins" (1964), "Carry On Abroad" (1972) and "Carry On Girls" (1973). His London stage debut came in "The Mating Game" (1973).
He staged an adaptation of Oor Wullie, the "Sunday Post" comic strip character, for the Dundee stage. His one-man musical based on the life of Scottish entertainer Sir Harry Lauder, was called "Lauder" (1976). Logan collected Lauder memorabilia, which is now housed in the Scottish Theatre Archive at the University of Glasgow.
Other theatrical events included "The Entertainer" (1984), "Brighton Beach Memoirs" (1989), Bill Bryden's "The Ship", "The Comedians" (1991), "On Golden Pond" (1996) and "Death of a Salesman" at the Pitlochry Festival (1992). In 1991 he had a supporting role in the Swedish comedy film "Den ofrivillige golfaren", which was partly filmed in Scotland.
Logan was awarded an honorary doctorate by Glasgow Caledonian University (1994), honoured with an Order of the British Empire (OBE) for "services to Scottish theatre" in 1996, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in 1998.
Logan's last two performances were at Pitlochry Festival Theatre and the Glasgow's Pavilion Theatre respectively. An extensive archive of his personal papers and performance ephemera is now held by the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland archives.
Death.
Logan died of cancer in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, Scotland, nine days after his 73rd birthday.
Autobiography.
Logan published his autobiography as "It's a Funny Life" in 1998.

SCE Studio Liverpool

SCE Studio Liverpool was a video game development house headquartered at Wavertree Technology Park in Liverpool, England. It was part of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios. Founded in 1984 as Psygnosis by Jonathan Ellis, Ian Hetherington and David Lawson, the company later became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony Computer Entertainment, and at the time of its closure employed roughly 100 individuals comprising two development teams. Mick Hocking oversaw Studio Liverpool's operations as its last Group Studio Director, a position he continues to hold within Evolution Studios.
Studio Liverpool was the oldest and second largest development house within Sony Computer Entertainment Europe's stable of developers, and is best known for the "Wipeout" series of futuristic racing games, with the first instalment released on the original PlayStation in 1995. The studio is also known for the "Formula One" series of licensed racing games, and the "Colony Wars" series released on the original PlayStation. As Psygnosis, they were the original publishers of the "Lemmings" series.
Reports of Studio Liverpool's closure surfaced on 22 August 2012, with "Edge" quoting staff tweets. Staff were told the news by the vice president of Sony Worldwide Studios Europe, Michael Denny. In a press release Sony stated that after an assessment of all European studios, it had decided to close Studio Liverpool. Sony said that the Liverpool site would remain in operation, as it is home to a number of Sony World Wide Studios and SCEE Departments.
History.
Psygnosis (1984–1993).
Founded by Jonathan Ellis, Ian Hetherington and David Lawson, the Liverpool-based Psygnosis was indirectly born from the ashes of the defunct 8-bit game company Imagine Software, where Lawson was one of the founders and Hetherington was Financial Director. After the collapse of Imagine in 1984, the name and trademarks were bought by Ocean Software, while the rights of the software remained with original copyright owners. After Imagine, Lawson and Hetherington set up a new company called Finchspeed which took two unfinished games developed by Imagine, "Bandersnatch" (for the ZX Spectrum) and "Psyclapse" (for the Commodore 64), and fused them into one to become "Brataccas", the first game published by Psygnosis.
Psygnosis produced only one title in 1986 called "Deep Space", a complex, difficult space exploration game. The box artwork was very distinctive with a black background and fantasy artwork bordered in red. This style was maintained for the best part of ten years, with a Psygnosis game being easily identifiable on a shelf of miscellaneous games. For the next few years, Psygnosis's releases contained increasingly improved graphics, but were marred by similarly difficult gameplay and control methods.
The original company headquarters were located at the Port of Liverpool Building at the Pier Head in Liverpool, but soon moved to Century Buildings in Brunswick Business Park (also in Liverpool), and later moved down the road 200 metres to South Harrington Building in South Harrington Dock.
Although Psygnosis primarily became a game publisher, some games were developed fully or partly in-house. During the early days, artists were employed full-time at the headquarters, offering third-party developers, who were often just single programmers, a very high-quality art resource. This had the result of allowing Psygnosis to maintain very high graphical standards across the board, something for which the company became most famous. The original artists were Garvan Corbett, Jeff Bramfitt, Colin Rushby and Jim Bowers, with Neil Thompson joining a little later.
Closely following in the path of 1987 hit "Barbarian" with what was becoming a trademark high-quality introduction, "Obliterator", released in 1988, contained an opening animation by Jim Bowers (now a digital matte painter for the movie industry) with the main character looking directly into the "camera". His face is animated with bewilderment that turns into anger, at which point he drops his guns and shoots at the observer. This short scene would further pave the way for many increasingly sophisticated intro animations, starting with 2D hand drawn sequences, and then progressing into FMV and 3D rendered movies created with Sculpt 4D on the Amiga. Eventually, Psygnosis would buy many Silicon Graphics workstations for the sole purpose of creating these animations.
While most games companies of the mid-to-late 1980s (including Psygnosis) were releasing identical games on both the Amiga and Atari ST, Psygnosis started to use the full potential of the Amiga's more powerful hardware to produce technically stunning games. It was these technically superior titles that brought the company its early success, with the landmark title "Shadow of the Beast" bringing the company its greatest success so far in 1989. Its multi-layered parallax scrolling and stunning music were highly advanced for the time and as such led to the game being used as a showcase demonstration for the Amiga in many computer shops.
Later, Psygnosis consolidated its fame after publishing the DMA Design "Lemmings" game franchise: debuting in 1991 on the Amiga, Lemmings was soon to be ported to a plethora of different computer and video game platforms, generating many sequels and variations of its concept through the years. After that, Psygnosis put unparalleled effort in producing "Microcosm", a game that debuted on Japanese system FM Towns and was to become technical showcase and flagship title for new Commodore CD32 and SMSG 3DO multimedia consoles: although gameplay was never considered on par with technical aspects, graphics, music by Rick Wakeman and long FMV introduction were among the finest in company history at the time. Phil Morris was Music Manager from 1992-1998 in Liverpool, and chose the Rick Wakeman music tracks and tracks by Steve Vai and Joe Satriani, both Sony artists at the time, for the PlayStation F1 game. Microcosm was probably the first CD-ROM game by Psygnosis to feature voice recordings, produced and directed in London by Phil Morris with Canadian voice actor Kerry Shale at The Sound Company.
Psygnosis also received top billing for creating the "Face-Off" games in the Nickelodeon 1992 television game show, "Nick Arcade", with such games as "Post Haste", "Jet Jocks" and "Battle of the Bands", among others.
Acquisition by Sony (1993–2001).
In 1993, the company was acquired by Sony Electronic Publishing. In preparation for the September 1995 introduction of Sony's PlayStation console in Western markets, Psygnosis started creating games using the PlayStation as primary reference hardware. Among the most famous creations of this period were "Wipeout", "G-Police", and the "Colony Wars" series, some of which were ported to PC and to other platforms.
The acquisition was rewarding for Sony in another aspect: development kits for PlayStation consoles. As it had previously published PSY-Q development kits for various consoles by SN Systems, Psygnosis arranged for them to create a development system for the PS based on cheap PC hardware. Sony evaluated the system during CES in January 1994 and decided to adopt it.
As Psygnosis expanded after the Sony buyout, another satellite office was opened in Century Building with later offices opening in Stroud, England, London, Chester, Paris, Germany, and Foster City in California (as the Customer Support & Marketing with software development done in San Francisco), now the home of Sony Computer Entertainment America. The company headquarters has resided at Wavertree Technology Park since 1995.
The Stroud studio was opened in November 1993 in order to attract disgruntled MicroProse employees.
Staff grew from initially about 50 to about 70 in 1997. Among the titles created at Stroud are Overboard! and G-Police.
The Wheelhouse—its publishing name—was closed in 2000 as part of the Sony Computer Entertainment takeover of Psygnosis. Some members joined Bristol-based Rage Software, but faced a similar demise a number of years later.
In 1999, the publishing branch of the company was merged into Sony Computer Entertainment Europe as a whole, and the Psygnosis brand was dropped in favour of SCE Studio Liverpool, which marked the full integration of the studio within Sony Computer Entertainment. Psygnosis's Camden and Stroud studios were renamed Studio Camden (later merged with Team Soho to form SCE London Studio) and Studio Stroud.
Studio Liverpool (2001–2012).
The newly named SCE Studio Liverpool released its first title, "Formula One 2001", in 2001. The game was also the studio's first release on the PlayStation 2, and the first entry in the "Formula One" series after taking over from developer Studio 33. From 2001 to 2007, Studio Liverpool released 8 instalments in the series between the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3. However, Sony Computer Entertainment's exclusive license with the Formula One Group expired, without renewal, before the 2007 season, marking the end of any further "Formula One" series instalments from the developer.
Studio Liverpool also created "Wipeout Fusion", the first of two instalments of the series on the PlayStation 2, released in 2002. Next they developed "Wipeout Pure" for the PlayStation Portable, which launched alongside the handheld in 2005 to significant acclaim, with many media outlets heralding it a return to glory for the series. They followed up with the sequel "Wipeout Pulse" in 2007 which was later ported to the PlayStation 2 and released exclusively in Europe and the UK.
In 2008, they released "Wipeout HD", a downloadable title for the PlayStation 3's PlayStation Network service, consisting of various courses taken from both "Wipeout Pure" and "Wipeout Pulse" remade in high definition. An expansion pack for "Wipeout HD" named "Wipeout HD Fury" is currently available at PlayStation Network, including new game modes, new tracks, new music and new ship skins/models.
On 29 January 2010, Sony made the following public statement: ""It has been decided that production on a number of projects within Studio Liverpool will cease immediately due to project prioritisation. Our North West Studio Group has been and will continue to be a vital cog in the WWS family, with a history of producing genre defining games such as MotorStorm, WipEout, Formula 1 and WRC and this decision will have no impact of the role that the North West Studio Group will play in the future of all PlayStation platforms"."
The closure of Studio Liverpool was announced on 22 August 2012. In a press release Sony stated that after an assessment of all European studios, it had decided to close Studio Liverpool. Sony said that the Liverpool site would remain in operation, as it is home to a number of Sony World Wide Studios and SCEE Departments.
Eurogamer was told by an unnamed source, that at the time of its closure, Studio Liverpool was working on two PlayStation 4 launch titles. One was a "Wipeout" title described as "dramatically different", the other was a motion capture based game along the lines of "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell". Because of the closure, it is unknown if the two games will go to other studios.
In 2013 a number of former Studio Liverpool employees formed a new studio called Firesprite. They worked on the visuals of "The Playroom" for the PlayStation 4.
XDev.
XDev, Sony's external development studio is responsible for managing the development of titles at developers that are outside of Sony's own developer group. It has won 8 British Academy (BAFTA) video game awards and AIAS awards for "LittleBigPlanet", 3 BAFTA awards for the "Buzz!" series and Develop Industry Excellence Awards for "MotorStorm" and "Buzz!".

HMS Ulysses (novel)

HMS Ulysses was the debut novel by Scottish author Alistair MacLean. Originally published in 1955, it was also released by Fontana Books in 1960. MacLean’s experiences in the Royal Navy during World War II provided the background and the ill-fated PQ-17 convoy to Murmansk provided the basis for the story, which was written at a publisher's request after he'd won a short story competition the previous year.
Some editions carry a prefatory note disavowing any connection between the fictional "HMS Ulysses" and the U-class destroyer of the same name.
Plot summary.
The novel features "HMS Ulysses", a light cruiser that is extremely well armed and among the fastest ships in the world. ("Ulysses" is similar to the real "Dido"-class cruisers. MacLean had served in of that class.) Her crew is pushed well beyond the limits of endurance and the book starts in the aftermath of a mutiny. "Ulysses" puts to sea again to escort FR-77, a vital convoy heading for Murmansk. (The fictitious convoy FR-77 is based on the ill-fated convoy PQ-17.) They are beset by numerous challenges: an unusually fierce Arctic storm, German ships and U-boats, as well as air attacks. All slowly reduce the convoy from 32 ships to only five. The "Ulysses" is sunk in a failed attempt to ram a German cruiser after all her other weapons had been destroyed. This echoes events in which British G-class destroyer and HMS "Jervis Bay", an armed merchant cruiser, sacrificed themselves by engaging larger opponents.
The book uses a set of events to paint moving portrayals of the crew and the human aspects of the war. His heroes are not especially motivated by ideals, they rarely excel at more than one task and they are overcome by a respectable enemy. It is their resilience that pushes this bunch of seamen to acts of heroism. The realism of the descriptions, the believable motivations of the characters and the simplicity of the line of events make the story all the more credible, though the number of coincidental accidents that plague the crew is startling.
Literary significance and criticism.
The novel received good critical notices, with a number of reviewers putting it in the same class as two other 1950s classic tales of World War II at sea, Herman Wouk's "The Caine Mutiny" and Nicholas Monsarrat's "The Cruel Sea". [http://www.harpercollins.co.uk/books/default.aspx?id=29386].
Allusions/references from other works.
The same background of the World War II Murmansk convoys, with the combination of extreme belligerent action and inhospitable nature pushing protagonists to the edge of endurance and beyond, appears in Dutch novelist Jan de Hartog's "The Captain" (1967). Comparisons may be also be drawn with Wolfgang Ott's 1957 novel "Sharks and Little Fish", written from the viewpoint of a sailor who serves on surface ships and submarines of the World War II German navy, the "Kriegsmarine".
The use of ship names derived from classical mythology is a well-established practice of the Royal Navy. However, commentator Bill Baley suggests that the choice of "Ulysses" might have been less than accidental. "Unlike in Joyce's famous book, there are here no specific scenes clearly reminiscent of specific ones in Homer's Odyssey; but overall, it was Homer's Ulysses who gave Western culture the enduring template of a long and harrowing sea voyage where peril waits at every moment and of which few of the crew would survive to see the end."
References to HMS Ulysses in other works.
Valentin Pikul chose a quotation from the novel as an epigraph to his "Requiem for Convoy PQ-17".
Film, TV and theatrical adaptations.
A film version was announced by the Rank Organisation at the Cannes Film Festival in 1980 but then was abandoned when Rank pulled out of filmmaking.
"HMS Ulysses" has never been filmed but it was adapted by Nick McCarty for a BBC Radio 4 play of the same name which was first aired on 14 June 1997 in the "Classic Play" series. It starred Sir Derek Jacobi as Captain Vallery and Sir Donald Sinden as Admiral Starr.

466 Tisiphone

466 Tisiphone is an asteroid which orbits among the Cybele family of asteroids.
Discovery.
It was discovered by Max Wolf and Luigi Carnera on January 17, 1901, and was assigned the provisional designation 1901 FX. It was named after Tisiphone of Greek mythology.
Physical properties.
A number of positional observations of Tisiphone were carried out in 1907, 1913, and 1914.
In 1992 a simple check of 466 Tisiphone's position was made by the Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers (ALPO). The asteroid was found to be in the expected position to within observational errors. Further checks were carried out in 1996, and 2006 with the asteroid in its expected position both times.
In 1997 Tisiphone was studied by Worman and Christianson at the Feder Observatory located near Minnesota State University, Moorhead, with the goal of determining its rotational period. A period of 8.824 ± 0.009 was arrived at, with the lightcurve data showing two distinct maxima and minima in its rotation.
In 2001 Lagerkvist "et al." published their results on a study of the Cybele asteroid family, which includes 466 Tisiphone. Relative photometric observations of Tisiphone were carried out in 1998 and 1999 using the 1.2 m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory located at the Max-Planck-Institut für Astronomie in Heidelberg, Germany. They were able to confirm the 8.8 hour rotation period obtained by Worman and Christianson.
In 2006 Fornasier "et al." published polarimetric data for a number of asteroids, including 466 Tisiphone.

<doc id="2846294" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2846294" title="Rhomphaia">
Rhomphaia

The Rhomphaia was a close combat bladed weapon used by the Thracians as early as 400 BC. Rhomphaias were polearms with a straight or slightly curved single-edged blade attached to a pole, which is most cases was considerably shorter than the blade. Although the rhomphaia was similar to the Falx, most archaeological evidence suggests that rhomphaias were forged with straight or slightly curved blades, presumably to enable their use as both a thrusting and slashing weapon. The blade was constructed of iron and used a triangular cross section to accommodate the single cutting edge with a tang of rectangular cross section. Length varied, but a typical rhomphaia would have a blade of approximately 60–80 cm and a tang of approximately 50 cm. From the length of the tang, it can be presumed that, when attached to the hilt, this portion of the weapon would be of similar length to the blade.
Usage.
Used almost exclusively by the Thracians, examples have been found dating from 300-400 BC. As a weapon, the rhomphaia was feared (like the Falx) because of the cutting power afforded to it by the polearm like design. The Falx forced the only documented change in Roman armour brought about by an encounter with a new weapon. After encountering the Falx in Dacia, the Romans added extra reinforcing bars to their helmets to protect against the powerful blows of this weapon.
The Byzantines used the Rhomphaia, an exclusive Thracian weapon, although it most likely was used by a few units of foot soldiers dating somewhere between Byzantium's golden age of 900-1071 and maybe even earlier. It was not mentioned as a weapon like the falx however. It was indeed a falx-like weapon. Michael Psellus writes that all Varangians without exception used what he refers to as a "rhomphaia".
Differences from the falx.
The rhomphaia's blade was straight or only slightly curved, while the falx's blade was significantly curved. Because its straighter blade facilitated a thrusting motion, as well as an overhead or sidewards hacking motion, the rhomphaia could be used by tightly packed troops as a defensive weapon. However, the straighter blade limited the use of the cutting edge.
Rhomphaia in historical texts.
Rhomphaia was first ‘a spear’, later ‘a sword’ (Plutarch: "Life of Aemilius Paulus" 18; Eustathius, on Iliad verse VI 166; Hesychius; also Luke 2;35 and the Revelation of John of Patmos, several times.).
In Latin, it has the forms:
W. Tomaschek listed the Bulgarian. roféja, rufja ‘a thunderbolt’ and the Albanian rrufë as derivatives of that word.
Rhomphaia was also preserved in modern Greek as rhomphaia ‘a big broad sword’. The Thracian rhomphaia contains the IE stem *rump- in the Latin rumpo, -ere ‘to break, to tear’.
Rhomphaia was also mentioned in Michael Psellos' "Chronographia" where he describes it as a "one-edged sword of heavy iron which they palace guards at Constantinople carry suspended from the right shoulder."
It is also mentioned in Anna Komnene's "The Alexiad". She explains that during the battle, her father, Alexios I Komnenos, fought against the rebel Nicephorus Bryennius. Alexius happened upon a horse saddled for an emperor, which also had a number of grooms, some of whom "had in their hands the great iron swords which normally accompany the emperors". However, Anna does not name these as rhomphaia, but her editor and translator E.R.A. Sewter does, and they seem to have been very distinctive for the Byzantines who, after an initial rout, saw "the general display of the royal horse with its insignia and the sight of the great swords (which all but spoke for themselves) convinced them that the news was true: Bryennius, who was guarded by these swords, had fallen into the hands of his enemies".

Swing When You're Winning

"Swing When You're Winning" is a swing cover album by English singer-songwriter Robbie Williams, and his fourth studio album overall. It was released in the United Kingdom on 19 November 2001 and peaked at number one on the UK Albums Chart.
The album's title is a play on Williams' previous album "Sing When You're Winning". In 2013, Williams returned to swing for his tenth studio album "Swings Both Ways". Unlike "Swing When You're Winning", however, the sequel is nearly evenly divided between covers and original songs penned by Williams and Guy Chambers.
Background.
After the success of his third studio album, "Sing When You're Winning", Williams wanted to take another musical direction. He took two weeks off his tour to record what would be his fourth studio album, an album he described as the "big band album he had always dreamed of making." The album was released in November 2001. Consisting mainly of pop standard covers common to the Great American Songbook, the album counts as Williams' fourth studio album. Aside from the title, the album is not directly associated with Williams' previous album, "Sing When You're Winning". Born from his lifelong love for Frank Sinatra, combined with the success of the track "Have You Met Miss Jones?" that he recorded for the film "Bridget Jones's Diary" in early 2001, the album was recorded at the Capitol Studios in Los Angeles, California, and was symbolically released under the Capitol label. The album features duets with actors Rupert Everett, Nicole Kidman, Jon Lovitz and Jane Horrocks, as well as a special guest performance from Robbie's friend and former flatmate Jonathan Wilkes. Surprisingly the album features a duet with Frank Sinatra on the song "It Was a Very Good Year", in which the instrumental backing track is sampled from the original Sinatra recording, the first two verses are sung by Williams, and, for the third and fourth verses, Sinatra's original vocal track is used. Williams explains this came about after one of his session musicians played his vocals to Sinatra's family. This musician was purportedly a good friend of the family, and played with Sinatra on the original release of "It Was a Very Good Year". Another surprising guest musician is pianist Bill Miller who accompanies Williams on "One for My Baby". Miller played on many of Sinatra's tours and recordings, among them, the original 1954 soundtrack recording of "One for My Baby" and the 1958 Capitol studio recording. Additionally, backing musicians for portions of the album include the London Session Orchestra. The album's lead song, "I Will Talk and Hollywood Will Listen", is the only original song on the album. Additionally, Williams' recording of "Beyond the Sea" featured in the 2003 animated motion picture "Finding Nemo".
Reception.
When the album was released in late 2001, it became an instant #1 hit in the United Kingdom, spending six consecutive weeks at #1. In Ireland, New Zealand, Austria, Germany and Switzerland, it reached the top 10, going on to sell over two million copies by the end of 2001 in the United Kingdom and over seven million copies worldwide. The album spent 57 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, certified 7× Platinum, and became the 49th best-selling album of all-time in the UK. In Germany, the album has become Williams' best-selling album there, selling more than 1,500,000 copies being certified 5× Platinum. The album debuted at #1 and stayed there for nine non-consecutive weeks. It managed to stay 83 weeks on the German Albums Chart, nineteen weeks of those in the top 10. Thanks to its success, it became the fourth best-selling album of the decade in Germany.
Live performances.
A live performance of the album from The Royal Albert Hall was released on DVD in December 2001. It has become one of the best selling music DVDs of all time in Europe, being certified 6× Platinum in the United Kingdom alone and 2× Platinum in Germany. The performance includes renditions of nearly all of the songs from the album, with guest appearances from Jonathan Wilkes, Jon Lovitz, and Jane Horrocks, as well as a live version of Robbie's 'duet' with Frank Sinatra. Rupert Everett emceed, and Nicole Kidman attended the show, but neither performed their duets featured on the album. Thus, "They Can't Take That Away from Me" and "Somethin' Supid" were the only songs from the album which were not performed live. Additionally, there were three songs performed live which did not appear on the album: "The Lady Is a Tramp", which featured as a B-side to "Mr. Bojangles", and "Let's Face the Music and Dance" and "My Way", which features as B-sides to "Somethin' Stupid".
On the occasion of the European premiere of the Disney movie "Finding Nemo" in November 2003 in Berlin, Williams, accompanied by a youth orchestra, gave a live performance of several songs of the album in the subway station "Bundestag" (which at that time was only structurally completed) in front of a few hundred invited premiere guests.
Williams gave a rare performance of "Mack the Knife" at Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee concert in June 2012.

Clayton J. Lonetree

Clayton J. Lonetree (born 1961), son of a Winnebago father and Navajo mother, served nine years in prison for espionage. During the early 1980s, Lonetree was a Marine Corps Security Guard stationed at the Embassy of the United States in Moscow.
Lonetree is the first US Marine to be convicted of spying against the United States. Lonetree, who was stationed in Moscow as a guard at the US Embassy in the early 1980s, confessed in 1987 to selling documents to the Soviet Union. Lonetree was seduced by a 25-year-old female KGB officer named "Violetta Seina" in that year. He was then blackmailed into handing over documents when he was assigned to Vienna, Austria. These documents included the blueprints of the US Embassy buildings in Moscow and Vienna and the names and identities of US undercover intelligence agents in the Soviet Union. He was tried in a military court in Quantico, Virginia and convicted of espionage on August 21, 1987.
In May 1991, Lonetree filed an appeal, asking that his conviction be overturned because he had never learned the identity of one accuser, but this was denied. He initially received a 30-year sentence with a reduction in rank from E-5 to E-1, a fine of $5,000, the loss of all military pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge. The Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Alfred M. Gray, Jr., recommended to the Secretary of the Navy that Lonetree's sentence be reduced from 30 to 15 years in a letter written in 1989 that said that the effect of Private Lonetree's actions "was minimal." In addition, he said, the Marine's motivation "was not treason or greed, but rather the lovesick response of a naive, young, immature and lonely troop in a lonely and hostile environment." His sentence was reduced to 15 years, but he was released in 1996 after serving only nine years at the United States Disciplinary Barracks.
According to "Time" magazine:
Marine Sergeant Clayton Lonetree, 25, was so highly regarded at his job as security guard at the U.S. embassy in Moscow that in November 1985 he was detached for special duty at the Reagan–Gorbachev summit in Geneva. Last week Lonetree sat in a brig at the Marine base at Quantico, Va., suspected by his superiors of helping the Soviet KGB filch classified U.S. documents from diplomatic offices in Moscow and Vienna. Lonetree, authorities said, had an affair with a female KGB agent who was reportedly working as a translator at the embassy.
He revealed the names of CIA personnel, detailed the work habits of embassy staff, and sketched the layout of the Moscow and Vienna embassy offices. The harsh sentence was given due to serious security breaches at the embassy, some of which later were found to have been the result of the Aldrich Ames case.
In 2001, Lonetree testified as an expert witness at the trial of former United States Army Reserve Colonel George Trofimoff, who was charged with spying for the KGB. After remorsefully describing his own recruitment by the Soviet State, Lonetree publicly sobbed on the witness stand. Colonel Trofimoff was subsequently convicted of espionage and sentenced to life imprisonment.

Per Johansson (trade unionist)

Per Johansson (born 1960 ?) is a Swedish trade unionist, a Communist and labor organizer. He worked for Connex in the Stockholm Metro and was the leader of the local branch of the Swedish Union for Service and Communications Employees ("SEKO"), "club 119". Johansson was fired in late September 2005. According to SEKO it was due to complaints of neglected security and safety conditions for workers and passengers, while Connex asserted that Johansson was guilty of harassing and threatening colleagues and the management. The firing of the union leader resulted in a wildcat strike amongst the subway workers in Stockholm on the morning of October 6, 2005. More strikes followed in November. These were organised by a rival union, the anarcho-syndicalist SAC. The dismissal was challenged in the Swedish Labour Court ("Arbetsdomstolen"), which found that the dismissal was lawful and justified. 
In the 1990s, Johansson was also a member of the Justice Party - the Socialists, a trotskyist organization.
